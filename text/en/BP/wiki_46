<text>The Lithuanian nobility () or &quot;szlachta&quot; of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (, ) was historically a legally privileged hereditary elite class in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth (including during period of foreign rule 1795–1918) consisting of Lithuanians from Lithuania Proper; Samogitians from Duchy of Samogitia; following Lithuania&#x27;s eastward expansion into what is now Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, many ethnically Ruthenian noble families (&quot;boyars&quot;); and, later on, predominantly Baltic German families from the Duchy of Livonia and Inflanty Voivodeship.

Initially, the privileged social group of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was called &quot;boyars&quot;. Boyars became part of the szlachta (nobility) during the Union of Horodło on October 2, 1413, initiating nobility in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania following the Western European model (with a hereditary system of heraldic identification), as well as an increase in the position of the Greater Lithuanian nobility. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes, and 47 selected boyars of Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Catholic faith were adopted by Polish noble families and received Polish coats of arms.

With the Union of Lublin, nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the nobility of the Kingdom of Poland became a common entity of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had one of the largest percentages of nobility in Europe, with szlachta constituting close to 10% of the population, but in some constituent regions, like Duchy of Samogitia, it was closer to 12%. However, the high nobility was extremely limited in number, consisting of the magnates and later, within the Russian Empire, of princes.

Families of the nobility were responsible for military mobilization and enjoyed Golden Liberty; some were rewarded with additional privileges for success on the battlefield. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ducal titles were mostly inherited by descendants of old dynasties while the relatively few hereditary noble titles in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had one of the largest percentages of nobility in Europe, with szlachta (nobility) constituting close to 10% of the population, but in some constituent regions, like Duchy of Samogitia, it was closer to 12%. However, the high nobility was extremely limited in number, consisting of the magnates and later, within the Russian Empire, of princes.

Over time, the vast majority of the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania voluntarily became Polonized and recognized Polish national thought as a natural continuation of Greater Lithuanian national thought&quot;&quot;.

== Cultural affiliation ==
According to the Polish historian Grzegorz Błaszczyk, &quot;Lithuanian nobility&quot; doesn’t mean the same as the &quot;leaders of today&#x27;s Lithuania&quot;, as the terms &quot;Lithuanians&quot; and &quot;Lithuanian&quot; have changed over the centuries&quot;.&quot; According to the Lithuanian historian Vytautas Spečiūnas, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was formed on the basis of Lithuania proper, which is a part of the Eastern Balts ethnic territory. According to the Polish historian , already during the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuania proper was a term designated to land where Lithuanians live. The Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas in his 11 March 1420 letter sent to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote about Samogitia that &quot;it is and has always been the same Lithuanian land, because there is one language and the same inhabitants. The people of Samogitia have long called themselves as Lithuanians and never as Samogitians, and because of such identity (&quot;sic&quot;) we do not write about Samogitia in our letter, because everything is one: one country and the same inhabitants&quot; (see also: Samogitian dialect, Lithuanian language).

As cultural homogenization and linguistic Polonization of the nobility progressed, the concept of Lithuanian began to mean simply regional difference within the uniform political nation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&quot;&quot; The main Polonizing factors, as in other areas of the &quot;First Republic of Poland&quot;, were the church, the manor and the city, where the lower social classes adopted and thereby took over the cultural patterns of the higher classes.

Already in 1576, seven years after the conclusion of the Union of Lublin, Augustyn Rotundus, a historiographer of Greater Lithuania at that time, wrote that the Lithuanian language previously used by some citizens of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was used by peasants, while the nobility widely adopted Polish. However, it should be mentioned that this process took place without orders or prohibitions, without coercion, mainly under the influence of civilizational domination and administrative influence (there is also no evidence of administrative coercion).

Polonization processes led to the fact that already in the 17th century, Lithuanian landowners called themselves &quot;gente Lithuani, natione Poloni&quot; (Latin: &quot;Lithuanians by birth, Poles by nationality&quot;). In 1697, in the entire Grand Duchy of Lithuania, at the request of the local Lithuanian nobility, Polish was introduced as the official language instead of the previously existing Ruthenian language.

In the 18th century, the Polonization of the lands within the borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a completed process, and the Polonization of Vilnius was a state of affairs. Despite the lack of their own state, the conviction of the permanent nature of Lithuania&#x27;s relationship with Poles and the territorial integrity of their common, although enslaved, homeland was strengthening in the minds of all Poles. In the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the cultural unity of inhabitants was strengthening, and many traditionally understood Lithuanians discovered a modern national identity - they became Poles. It should be noted, however, that the described processes took place almost exclusively within the nobility and landed gentry and among the intelligentsia.

The fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and unsuccessful armed uprisings led to the strengthening of the Polonization processes of the small nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, identifying spiritually and culturally with Polish traditions. Post-uprising repression resulted in the Catholic Church becoming the mainstay of Polishness. Because the Catholic Church had a Polish character, it became an element integrating both the conscious classes and the popular masses, who began to identify with Polishness through their religion.

The January Uprising of 1863-1864 and the wave of post-uprising repressions were a great shock for the people of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, under the influence of painful experiences, the sense of community between Lithuanianness and Polishness became even stronger, and the belief in the identity of both elements became almost a patriotic axiom. Additionally, in the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, the process of linguistic Polonization of the rural population accelerated rapidly, especially in the Vilnius region.

In the consciousness of the general Polish society at that time, the multi-ethnic heritage of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was increasingly identified simply with Polish heritage. Such views were held by the most active and opinion-forming layer of the emerging nation. The intelligentsia grew up in an atmosphere of supremacy of nobility culture, so they easily identified with it. It adopted the nobility&#x27;s way of perceiving the world, even if it came from other social groups. According to a commonly accepted interpretation, the history of the &quot;peoples&quot; inhabiting the eastern lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth constituted an integral part of the history of Poles. The local &quot;peoples&quot; (especially Lithuanians and Belarusians) were perceived at best as &quot;younger brothers&quot;, naturally subordinated to the Polish national interest. It was therefore necessary to educate them and guide them in the right direction, because they were not yet mature enough to make independent decisions. &quot;Our Polish paternalism - writes Roman Wapiński - is firmly located in the East.

In the Second Polish Republic, Lithuanians lived mainly in the counties on the border with Lithuania: Święciany, Vilnius-Trakai and Suwałki, and almost all of them were rural people engaged in agriculture. At the beginning of the 20th century, descendants of former noble Lithuanians were most likely to call themselves Poles. Only a part of the nobility, openly referring to the traditions of historical Lithuania, trying to reconcile Lithuanianness with Polishness, called themselves &quot;&quot;old Lithuanians&quot;, &quot;historical Lithuanians&quot; or &quot;The Mickiewicz&#x27;s&quot;&quot; (i.e. - such as in Adam Mickiewicz, from the first words of the invocation from the poem Pan Tadeusz: &quot;O Lithuania, my country ... &quot; ). In turn, the representatives of the former &quot;Semigalian people&quot;, now &quot;nationalized&quot;, called themselves Lithuanians, additionally reserving the exclusive right to this term. However, attempts were made to create organizations of native Lithuanians of noble descent. On April 4, 1928, the Lithuanian Boyars Society () was established, which operated until 1940. 

Upon adoption of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990 and this way ending the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the Royal Union of the Lithuanian Boyars () was established in Vilnius in 1994 which continues the interwar period Society traditions, perform legitimation processes of historical Lithuanian nobles, organize ceremonies of awarding acts of recognition of nobility and unites thousands of Lithuanian nobles. However, the criteria for belonging to the nobility of this organization are treated liberally, accepting members who can prove their descent only through the female line. Therefore, the Royal Union of the Lithuanian Boyars has no chance of acceptance by international associations.

According to Professor Grzegorz Błaszczyk, the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania belongs primarily to the descendants of old Greater Lithuanian families, most of whom were Polonized and still live in Poland today.&quot;&quot; The last representative of the great Lithuanian families living in today&#x27;s Lithuania, Stefania Maria Romer, died in 2012. Meanwhile, in Poland, about 2,000 Polish families with Lithuanian origins live and use the Polish language,&quot;&quot; including the Radziwiłł,&quot;&quot; Czartoryski, Tyszkiewicz, Sanguszko, Sapieha, Giedroyć, Piłsudski, Puzyna, Woroniecki and Romer families.&quot;&quot;

The president of the &quot;Genealogical and Heraldic Society of Lithuania&quot;, Czesław Malewski, commented that &quot;currently there are no famous families left in Lithuania, and the functioning and competing associations of the Lithuanian nobility gather in their ranks representatives of the minor nobility, most often descending from their families on the distaff side&quot;.

== History ==

=== Lithuania before formal Christianization ===
Prior to the baptism by Mindaugas, lesser members of the nobility were called &quot;bajorai&quot; (singular - &quot;bajoras&quot;) and greater nobles, &quot;kunigai&quot; (singular - &quot;kunigas&quot;), related to the Old , meaning &quot;king&quot;, or , usually translated as duke, . These positions evolved from tribal leaders and were chiefly responsible for waging wars and organizing raids operations into enemy territories. Following the establishment of a unified state, they gradually became subordinates to greater Dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania. After Mindaugas&#x27; death, all Lithuanian rulers held the title &quot;Grand Duke&quot; (), or king, which was the title sometimes used by Gediminas and several others.

Ethnic Lithuanian nobility had different names than common people, as their names consisted of two stems. Greater noble families generally used their predecessor&#x27;s Lithuanian pagan given names as their family names; this was the case with Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others. Those families acquired great wealth, eventually becoming magnates. Their representatives are respectively Jonas Goštautas, Radvila Astikas, Kristinas Astikas and Mykolas Kęsgaila. The aforementioned families were granted corresponding Polish coats of arms under the Union of Horodlo in 1413.

While at the beginning the nobility was almost all Lithuanian or Samogitian, with territorial expansion more Ruthenian families joined the nobility. As early as the 16th century, several Ruthenian noble families began to call themselves &quot;gente Ruthenus, natione Lithuanus&quot;. A good example is the Chodkiewicz family, which attributed its ancestry to the House of Gediminas.

==== Formation of the noble estate ====
The term &quot;boyar&quot;, &quot;boiarstvo&quot; () originally denoted all those who fought. Over the course of the 15th century, it changed its meaning to refer to the masses of ordinary nobility who could stand up to fight when called upon. There were also social groups that were personally free but had no military commitments. Such a group were, for example, &quot;putnie&quot; boyars, who served as grand-ducal envoys and were in charge of road maintenance. A significant group of boyars were service boyars who did not own allodial land, but only service estates, which they received and owned only by the grace of the Grand Duke. As the role and wealth of the great magnates increased, the service boyars put themselves at the service of the lords and princes in exchange for tenures. 

The process of the formation of the noble estate in Lithuania accelerated after the union with Poland when there arose a desire to equalize the legal system of both countries. Nobility, or &quot;szlachta&quot;, in Poland was already a well-established estate, its legal position was consolidated in the 14th century. At this point, it was basically impossible to enter the noble status otherwise than by birth. The development of the idea of &quot;corona regni&quot; aroused among the nobility a notion of being the main unifying force of the kingdom and responsible for its rule. Lithuanian nobles aspired to this position. Privileges of 1387 and 1413 gave legal security of tenure to holders of allodial land and recognized in law the rights of landowners to pass on their estates. Although allodial land ownership was previously known in the Grand Duchy, its prevalence increased significantly in the following period. Similarly, the new law of inheritance led to a decline in the importance, outside Kaunas district and Samogitia, of clan kinships, in favour of more nuclear families.

This led to a rapid change in the structure of land ownership. While in 1386 80% of the population lived in the lands directly under the Grand Duke&#x27;s rule, by 1528 this figure had fallen to 30%. It is estimated that 5% of the land was owned by the Church, while as much as 65% of the land was then in the hands of 13 thousand of noble families (6 thousand of them were of Lithuanian origin). Most of it was owned by a small group of several dozen families of lords, which constituted the political elite of the country. 

New terms emerged for all those of noble birth: &quot;shliakhta&quot; (from ; ) in Ruthenian and &quot;nobiles&quot; in Latin. The term &quot;&quot; () began to denote the nobles who possessed land. &quot;Szlachta&quot; itself was stratified into several categories.

As the privileges and political importance of the nobility grew and the burdens and freedoms of the peasantry were reduced, these linguistic differences began to gain importance. Around the beginning of the 16th century, groups of boyars spared no effort to prove their noble status. The grand ducal council resolved that nobility had to be attested by the testimony of two neighbours, of undoubtedly noble lineage, saying that the applicant&#x27;s family had been &quot;boyars and &quot;shliakhta&quot; through the ages&quot;. Another opportunity to prove nobility were the military musterings, the first one organised in 1528, where a register of those capable to fight was prepared. A listing in such a register was legal proof of nobility.

==== Emergence of a magnate elite ====
Initially, a group distinguished by prestige were the princely families, which members bore the title of knyaz. These were mostly, at least according to tradition, the descendants of the dynasties who accepted the authority of Gediminids. However, only those who owned land in Lithuania proper, who were of Lithuanian origin and who had accepted Catholicism in 1386, had any influence on central state policy. The Ruthenian princes had influence only on the local situation in their lands. They varied considerably in terms of wealth and importance, some of them wielding huge estates, while others possessed their land on service tenure from the grand duke or another prince (so-called &#x27;service princes&#x27; - &quot;князя слчжбовiе&quot;). The most powerful princes retained almost total power in their lands, recognising the supremacy of the grand dukes. Vytautas began a policy of limiting the power of the princes and incorporating their appanages into the domain. Many princes died in civil wars after his death. Many appanages, lying in the east, were lost to Moscow in the course of wars in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some families became extinct, and with the restriction of the circle of inheritance, their estates were incorporated into the grand-ducal domain. In 1499 Alexander regulated the legal system of the few remaining appanages, the magnates ruling them were given the full &quot;ius ducale&quot;. This was of little political significance since the princes as a political class were of little importance.

Regarding Lithuania proper, not counting descendants of Gediminas seven princely families are known: Borowski, Dowgowd, Giedraitis/Giedrojć, Jamontowicz, Holshansky, Sudemund, Świrski. They also used the title knyaz, which is probably a rendering of the Lithuanian &quot;kunigas&quot;, which in pagan times probably belonged to every person of noble status. It is not clear whether they owed their princely dignity to their former status as sovereigns or to their connection and affinity with the ruling family established in the 14th century (this is confirmed at least for the Gedraitis and Holshanskys).

Among them, only the Holshansky played a significant role on the side of the grand dukes, starting from Jogaila and Vytautas, being in the strict power elite. Apart from them, these were the families descended from Gediminas family: Olelkovich, Belsky, Kobryński and Zasławski. The princes of ethnically Ruthenian origin were excluded from the strict power elite and found their place in it only at the end of the 15th century. Then the representatives of powerful Volhynian families: Sanguszko, Czartoryski, Ostrogski and Zasławski found their place in the power elite.

Since the reign of Vytautas, documents began to distinguish a group of great lords, calling them in Latin &quot;baro&quot; (pl. &quot;barones&quot;), &quot;dominus&quot; (pl. &quot;domini&quot;) or, in Ruthenian texts, &quot;great boyars&quot; (&quot;боярe великie&quot;). Soon, the borrowed from Polish term &quot;pan&quot; (plural &quot;pany&quot;, &quot;пан&quot;; or ), literally meaning &quot;lord&quot; gained popularity. This new elite was only partly descended from the old princely families that ruled Lithuania in pagan times. To a large extent, these were new families that appeared during the reigns of Jogaila and Vytautas and whose representatives were among the signatories of the Union of Horodło (1413). They owed their position to the generosity of the grand dukes, who rewarded them with offices and land granted in allodium.

In the Union of Horodło (1413) forty-five Polish families adopted forty-seven Lithuanian Catholic families, lending them their coats of arms. It is assumed that the representatives of Lithuanian nobility gathered in Horodło constituted the elite of that time on which Vytautas based his authority. The adoption of Polish coats of arms, an important marker of nobility with a well-established tradition in Western Europe, elevated this narrow group above other privileged population groups. Despite the fact that some of them abandoned the Horodło coats of arms and replaced them with others, the political significance of this gesture did not lose its significance. In the system built by Vytautas, central offices were restricted to Catholics only, which excluded nobles of Ruthenian origin. The basis of the Grand Duke&#x27;s power was the lands of Lithuania proper, basically the provinces of Trakai and Vilnius. Nobles from this region constituted the ruling elite. The situation began to change in the 1430s when nobility privileges began to be extended to the Ruthenian nobility. 

The cementing of the new elite was strengthened by the emergence of the institution of the council. Initially, it had no institutionalized form but gathered the ruler&#x27;s closest associates. However, from 1430 onwards, it began to take shape as a permanent institution, to which one automatically became a member by virtue of holding the relevant office. Possession of the princely title gave the right to participate in wider councils, called Sejm (&quot;сеймь&quot;, &quot;сoймь&quot;) a term borrowed from Polish. Their position grew especially during the period when the Grand Duke was also King of Poland and was away from the country for long periods. Crucial to this was the privilege of 1492, which gave the council enormous influence over the politics of the Grand Duchy. Practically giving it full control over the actions of the ruler. While in Poland at that time the limitation of royal power was associated with an increase in the role of the ordinary nobility, in the Grand Duchy, where nobility assemblies (&quot;sejmiks&quot;) did not exist, full power passed into the hands of the great lords. Grand Duchy of Lithuania offices were held almost exclusively by magnates.

Potent Radziwiłł family (Radvila) received the title of the prince (; ) from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1518, similarly some other families received titles of counts (Goštautai/Gasztołd in 1529/30; Ilinicz in 1553; Chodkiewicz in 1568; possibly Kęsgailos/Kieżgajło in 1547) from the Emperor. The elevation of the Radziwiłł family resulted in the abandonment of the title of &quot;knyaz&quot; by those Ruthenian families that still retained significant power, wealth and often appanages (for example Wiśniowiecki, Ostrogski, Zbaraski). They adopted instead the Polish title &quot;książę&quot;, which in Ruthenian texts was translated as &quot;knyazhe&quot;. As a result, the poorer prince families that still used the title of knyaz fell completely into insignificance, and the Lithuanian magnate elite consisted of &quot;princes and lords&quot; ().

==== Privileges ====
Following his distribution of state land, the Grand Duke became dependent on powerful landowners, who began demanding greater liberties and privileges. The nobles were granted administrative and judicial power in their domains and increasing rights in state politics. The legal status of the nobility was based on several privileges, granted by the Grand Dukes:

* In 1387 the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jogaila, newly crowned King of Poland, granted a privilege to nobles and soldiers. They received personal rights, including the right to inherit and govern land as well as estates inherited from ancestors or gifted by the Grand Duke. At the same time, the nobles had duties to serve in the military, build, maintain and safeguard castles, bridges, roads and other vicinities.
* In 1413 Vytautas and Jogaila signed Union of Horodło. The act served to renew Polish–Lithuanian union and establish a common Sejm, guaranteeing the right to inherit lands gifted by the Grand Duke. Forty-three Lithuanian noble families were granted Polish coats of arms. Most of the &quot;veldamai&quot; became serfs.
* Jogaila&#x27;s privilege in 1432 in essence repeated previous acts. Military service remained the primary means to receive land.
* Privilege of May 6, 1434 was granted by Sigismund Kestutaitis to Catholic and Eastern Orthodox nobility. They were guaranteed freedom to dispose of their land. Significantly, the act also prohibited persecution without a fair trial.
* In 1447 Casimir I Jagiellon limited positions within the Catholic Church or state institutions only to people from Lithuania. Certain nobles were released from their duties to the Grand Duke. This privilege also marked the beginnings of serfdom in Lithuania, as peasants were removed from the Grand Duke&#x27;s jurisdiction.
* 1492 privilege by Alexander Jagiellon renewed the 1447 privilege and added a few more provisions, the most important of which limited the Grand Duke&#x27;s rights in regards to foreign policy. The Grand Duke became dependent on the Lithuanian Council of Lords. Without the consent of the Council no high official could be removed from his position. Lower posts had to be appointed in the presence of voivodes of Vilnius, Trakai, and other voivodeships. The privilege also prohibited selling various state and church positions to nobility. In turn, the Grand Duke was limited from exploiting conflicts between higher and lower nobility and profiting by selling the positions. This privilege also signified that city residents could not become officials.
* In 1506 Sigismund I the Old confirmed the position of the Council of Lords in state politics and limited acquisition of positions within the noble class.
* On April 1, 1557, Sigismund II Augustus initiated the Wallach reform, which completed the establishment of serfdom. The implementation of serfdom deprived the peasants of land ownership as well as personal rights, making the serfs completely dependent on nobles.
* Union of Lublin in 1569 created the new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The nobility was granted the right to elect a common ruler for Poland and Lithuania.
* The Third Statute of Lithuania, completed in 1588, further expanded the rights of nobility. Laws could be enacted only by the general sejm. The nobility was granted triple immunity: legal, administrative and tax exemption. The statute finalized the division between nobility, peasants, and city residents.

Most of the nobility rights were retained even after the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.

==== After the Union of Lublin ====
The nobility was particularly numerous in the ethnically Lithuanian lands and is estimated to have constituted about 10-11%, while in the Ruthenian lands of the Grand Duchy only about 3-4%. The nobility in Samogitia was particularly numerous, but usually, it was a poor nobility living in gentry villages. In the right-bank part of Kaunas county the nobility accounted for as much as 25% of the hearths in the late 18th century. In 1777 there were 16,534 noble houses registered (5.2% of the total) in the whole Grand Duchy. In 1790 the register showed 100 palaces, 9,331 manors, 494 noblemen&#x27;s houses in towns, and 13,890 houses of noblemen without subjects.

Linguistic Polonization did not always mean full Polonization in the state or ethnic sense. The Lithuanian nobility felt united with the Polish nobility as part of one political nation of the Commonwealth, enjoying privileges, freedom and equality. In this sense, they often referred to themselves as &quot;Polish nobility&quot; or outright &quot;Poles&quot;. At the same time, separatism and the defense of Lithuanian national separateness within the federation state were very strong. The Lithuanian nobility was warmly attached to the laws, traditions and symbols of the Grand Duchy. Moreover, the Lithuanian separateness was also defended by the members of ethnically Polish families settling in Lithuania.

== Ties to the Kingdom of Poland ==

Following the Union of Horodło (1413), the Lithuanian nobility&#x27;s rights were equalized with those of the ruling class of the Kingdom of Poland (&quot;szlachta&quot;). During the following centuries, the Lithuanian nobility began to merge with the Polish nobility. The process accelerated after the Union of Lublin (1569), resulting in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Lithuanian nobility polonised, replacing Lithuanian and Ruthenian languages with Polish although the process took centuries. In the 16th century, a newly established theory amongst Lithuanian nobility was popular, claiming that Lithuanian nobility was of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. By that time, the upper nobility and the ducal court already used Polish as their first language. The last Grand Duke known to have spoken Lithuanian was Casimir IV Jagiellon (1440-1492). In 1595 Mikalojus Daukša addressed Lithuanian nobility calling for the Lithuanian language to play a more important role in state life. The usage of Lithuanian declined, and the Polish language became the predominant administrative language in the 16th century, eventually replacing Ruthenian as the official language of the Grand Duchy in 1697. Nonetheless, spoken Lithuanian was still common in the Grand Duchy courts during the 17th century.

At first, only Lithuanian magnate families were affected by Polonization, although many of them like the Radziwiłłs remained loyal to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and safeguarded its sovereignty vis-à-vis the Kingdom of Poland. Gradually Polonization spread to a broader population, and for the most part, the Lithuanian nobility became part of both nations’ szlachta.

The middle nobility adopted the Polish language in the 17th century, while the minor rural nobles remained bilingual up to the period when the question of language related-nationality appeared.

The Lithuanian nobles did preserve their national awareness as members of the Grand Duchy, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots; their leaders would continue to represent the interests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the General sejm and in the royal court.

Lithuanian language was used during Kościuszko Uprising in the proclamations calling to rise up For our freedom and yours. And Lithuanian nobles did rise to fight for the independence of their nation.

== After partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ==

In Lithuania proper, the Polonization of the nobility, gentry and townspeople was practically complete by the early 19th century, relegating the Lithuanian language to the status of a peasant&#x27;s tongue. The processes of Polonization and russification were partially reversed with the Lithuanian National Revival. Despite origins from mostly the non-noble classes, a number of nobles re-embraced their Lithuanian roots.

The lesser Lithuanian nobility, still partially preserving the Lithuanian language, subsequent to the partitions of the Commonwealth left most of the former Grand Duchy under control of the Russian Empire. The situation worsened during the years of tsar Nicholas I of Russia&#x27;s rule. After the November uprising imperial officials wanted to minimize the social base for another potential uprising and thus decided to reduce the noble class. During the period 1833–1860, 25,692 people in Vilna Governorate and 17,032 people in Kovno Governorate lost their noble status. They could not prove their status with monarchs&#x27; privileges or land ownership. They did not lose personal freedom, but were assigned as &quot;one steaders&quot; in rural areas and as &quot;citizens&quot; in towns.

In view of the January Uprising, imperial officials announced that &quot;Lithuanians are Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism&quot; and banned press in the Lithuanian language and started the &quot;Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings&quot;.

Over the course of time, the Lithuanian nobility increasingly developed a sense of belonging to the Polish nation. During the 19th century, a self-designation, often represented using a Latin formula &quot;gente Lithuanus, natione Polonus&quot; (&quot;Lithuanian by birth, Polish by nationality&quot;) was common in Lithuania Proper and the former Samogitian Eldership. With Polish culture developing into one of the primary centers of resistance to the Russian Empire, Polonization in some regions actually strengthened in response to official policies of Russification. An even larger percentage of Lithuanian nobility was Polonised and adopted Polish identity by the late 19th century. A Russian census in 1897 showed that 27.7% of nobility living within modern Lithuania&#x27;s borders recognized Lithuanian as the mother language. This number was even higher in Kovno Governorate, where 36.6% of nobility identified the Lithuanian language as their mother language.

Most descendants of the Lithuanian nobility remained ill-disposed to the modern national movements of Lithuania and Belarus and fought for Poland in 1918-1920. The landowning nobles in the new Lithuanian state saw themselves predominately as Poles of Lithuanian background. During the interbellum years the government of Lithuania issued land reform limiting manors with 150 hectares of land while confiscating land from those nobles who were fighting alongside the Polish in Polish-Lithuanian War. Many members of the Lithuanian nobility during the interbellum and after World War II emigrated to Poland, many were deported to Siberia during the years 1945–53 of Soviet occupation, many manors were destroyed. The Association of Lithuanian Nobility was established in 1994.

== Heraldry ==
Lithuanian and Samogitian families possessed heraldry predating formal Christianization. The most archaic type of post-1413 heraldry has a motive of crossed arrows. According to the Union of Horodło of 1413, 47 Lithuanian and Samogitian noble houses adopted Polish nobility coat of arms. As the nobility expanded during the following centuries more coats of arms were created.

<text>Nizhny Novgorod Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Nizhny Novgorod. It has a population of 3,119,115 as of the 2021 Census. From 1932 to 1990 it was known as Gorky Oblast ().

The oblast is crossed by the Volga River. Apart from Nizhny Novgorod&#x27;s metropolitan area (including Dzerzhinsk, Bor and Kstovo) the biggest city is Arzamas. Near the town of Sarov there is the Serafimo-Diveyevsky Monastery, one of the largest convents in Russia, established by Saint Seraphim of Sarov. The Makaryev Monastery opposite of the town of Lyskovo used to be the location of the largest fair in Eastern Europe. Other historic towns include Gorodets and Balakhna, located on the Volga to the north from Nizhny Novgorod.

==Geography==

The oblast covers an area of , which is approximately equal to the entire area of the Benelux countries or Czech Republic. Agricultural land occupies 41% of this area; forests, 48%, lakes and rivers, 2%; and other lands, 9%. Nizhny Novgorod Oblast borders Kostroma Oblast (N), Kirov Oblast (NE), the Mari El Republic (E), the Chuvash Republic (E), the Republic of Mordovia (S), Ryazan Oblast (SW), Vladimir Oblast (W), and Ivanovo Oblast (NW).

===Natural resources===
Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is not rich in natural resources, which are limited to commercial deposits of sand (including titanium-zirconium sands), clay, gypsum, peat, mineral salt, and timber.

==History==
The sites of Pustyn I and the settlement of Naumovka I, Krasny Bor 5 and others belong to the Mesolithic era in the Nizhny Novgorod region. Burial grounds of the Fatyanovo culture of the Bronze Age were found in the Chkalovsky, Vetluzhsky and Krasnobakovsky districts.

In the course of the regional reform of Peter I in 1708, Nizhny Novgorod with the surrounding lands was added to the Kazan Governorate. In 1714, the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate was created.

On January 14, 1929, the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast was formed. On July 15 of the same year, it was transformed into the Nizhny Novgorod Territory.

On October 7, 1932, the Nizhny Novgorod Territory was renamed the Gorky Territory (in honor of the writer Maxim Gorky). On December 5, 1936, the Gorky Territory was transformed into the Gorky Oblast (the Mari and Chuvash Republics were taken from the former territory).

On January 7, 1954, the Arzamas Oblast was separated from the Gorky Oblast. On April 23, 1957, the Arzamas Oblast was abolished, and its territory was returned to the Gorky Oblast.

On October 22, 1990, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, the Gorky Oblast was renamed the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. On April 21, 1992, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Russia approved the decision of the presidium of the parliament to rename the region, amending Art. 71 of the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978, which entered into force on May 16, 1992.
==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Nizhny Novgorod (then Gorki) CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority); the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power); and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside the elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Sights==

The unique architectural construction—the steel lattice hyperboloid tower built by the Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov in 1929—is located near the town of Dzerzhinsk on the left bank of the Oka River.

<text>The Peak is the independent student newspaper of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. It is split into six major sections: News, Opinions, Features, Arts, Sports, and Humour.

==History==

&quot;The Peak&quot; was founded on October 6, 1965 through the merger of SFU&#x27;s two original student newspapers, &quot;The Tartan&quot; and &quot;The SF View&quot;. &quot;The Tartan&quot; had published six issues under the editorship of Lorne Mallin, while the &quot;SF View&quot; had published one, edited by Rick McGrath. Because no name had yet been decided, the first printed issue was unnamed; the October 20, 1965 issue was the first to carry the banner of &quot;The Peak&quot;.

&quot;The Peak &quot;achieved full financial and editorial autonomy from the Student Society in a 1995 decision, bringing &quot;The Peak&quot; in line with the majority of Canadian student newspapers. Student newspapers seek autonomy mostly to avoid conflicts of interest, in which the Student Society, or the university, attempts to exert control over the content of the paper.

Many &quot;Peak&quot; staffers have gone on to careers as journalists and authors. Notable &quot;Peak&quot; alumni include journalist and author Allen Garr; Vancouver Province copy editor Lorne Mallin; author and interviewer John Sawatsky, award-winning Calgary Herald journalist Michelle Lang; comedian Mark Little from CBC&#x27;s &quot;Mr. D&quot;; Charles Demers, a comedian and author of &quot;Vancouver Special&quot;; journalist Stephen Hui, author of &quot;105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia&quot; and other guidebooks; journalist Tara Henley, author of &quot;Lean Out: A Meditation on the Madness of Modern Life&quot;; and professor Ian Rocksborough-Smith, author of &quot;Black Public History in Chicago&quot;.

==Staff and structures==
There are 15 editors who comprise &quot;The Peak&quot;″s editorial board: editor-in-chief, copy, production and design, assistant production and design (2), news, assistant news, opinions, features, arts, sports, humour, photo, multimedia, and assistant multimedia. They also have three possible staff writer positions available, as well as a volunteer proofreader position. All editorial roles, with the exception of editor-in-chief and volunteer proofreader are hired on a semesterly basis. Editors may, and very often do, seek multiple terms, sometimes ultimately spanning several years. There is no sports editor position in the summer semester. Until December 2016 there was a paid proofreader position, but it was discontinued as a paid position.

There are several non-editorial roles, hired at an hourly/salary rate, which are not rehired each semester, including social media and promotions coordinator, business manager, web manager, and distribution manager (2). The business manager has historically been the most long-lived position at the paper, and is thus the repository for much of the newspaper&#x27;s institutional memory. &quot;The Peak&quot; also maintains a board of directors under the larger Peak Publications Society, which makes certain other decisions, mostly financial in nature. This board is made up partly of editorial staff, partly of &quot;at large&quot; representatives, and of &quot;The Peak&quot;″s business manager.

From 1980 to September 2012, &quot;The Peak&quot; functioned as an editorial collective, without a managing editor or editor-in-chief position. Each editor maintained general control of their section or process, while broader decisions were made by consensus by the editorial collective as a whole. &quot;Peak&quot; editors were elected by the paper&#x27;s voting &quot;collective,&quot; which formally consisted of all editors and recent writers, for a period of one &quot;semester&quot; (what SFU calls its trimesters).

As of September 2014, &quot;The Peak&quot; once again operates under the management of an editor-in-chief, with a hiring process used to employ section editors. The editor-in-chief is still an elected role as of February 2019.

In July 2022, &quot;The Peak&quot; added the position of fact-checker, to aid the copy editor and section editors in their fact-checking duties. 

Like many student newspapers in British Columbia, &quot;The Peak&quot; is formally run as a registered non-profit society under the BC Societies Act, known as the &quot;Peak Publications Society&quot;. Technically all SFU students are members of the Peak Society, and refundable membership dues are imposed on all students at SFU as part of the university&#x27;s student activity fee, which are used to partially fund the paper&#x27;s operations.

A number of &quot;Peak&quot; staffers have also held prominent roles in Canadian University Press, the national student newspaper cooperative and wire service, of which &quot;The Peak&quot; was a long-standing member.

==Printing==

&quot;The Peak&quot; publishes weekly during &quot;SFU&quot; regular semesters, which totals 13 issues per semester, and 39 per year. Currently, &quot;The Peak&quot; is one of very few student newspapers that continues to run weekly issues during the summer. Like most of Canada&#x27;s major student newspapers, &quot;The Peak&quot; is a member of the Canadian University Press.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Edmonton Journal &quot;columnist Michael Hingston published a fictionalized account of his time at &quot;The Peak,&quot; titled &quot;The Dilettantes&quot; (Freehand Books). It was named one of CBC Books&#x27; must-read books of Fall 2013.

<doc id="475290" wikidata="Q690342" url="?curid=475290" title="Harem (genre)">
<text>is a genre of light novels, manga, anime, and video games focusing on a main character surrounded by multiple potential romantic or sexual partners. Originating in Japan in the 1970s, its popularity increased during the late 1980s and 1990s with the advent of dating simulator games. The genre often features a protagonist who&#x27;s surrounded by three or more suitors, love interests and/or sexual partners. Harem works are frequently comedies that rely on self-insert protagonists of whom allow projection for the viewer, often accompanied with an ensemble cast of supporting characters. A story featuring a heterosexual male or homosexual female protagonist paired with an all-female/yuri harem is informally referred to as a &#x27; or &#x27;, while a heterosexual female or gay male protagonist paired with an all-male harem series is informally referred to as a &#x27;, &#x27;, or . Although originating in Japan, the genre later inspired variants in Western media.

==Structure==
The most distinguishable trait of harem works is the presence of a single protagonist surrounded by multiple different characters who are treated as options for a sexual or romantic relationship. In some instances, the plot may follow an additional arc for the protagonist and these characters to embark on together; however, many harem works, especially dating sims, focus on the relationships themselves (and the tension and competition between different potential partners) as the key driver of the plot. 

===Tropes===
While harem works are a loose genre and vary greatly, certain tropes that lend themselves to reader self-insertion are common. 

The protagonist, commonly an everyman-archetype, often has very little characterization other than general amicability and reacting passively to their surroundings. This is done specifically to let the readers insert themselves in the character&#x27;s stead or develop sympathy for the character. 

Many harem love interests are easily enamored with the self-insert; falling for the main character because of simple kindness or coincidence, often described as due to their low self-esteem.

====Ending====
Harem works frequently put off commitment to any specific love interest for as long as possible, sometimes indefinitely; commonly executed by oblivious or easily-flustered protagonists. By leaving the protagonist&#x27;s desires and choices unclear, viewers with different preferences are able to continue their self-insertion without coming into conflict with source material canon.
Most Harem works end with the main character pairing up with one or more of their suitors, with some games and visual novels featuring branched endings dependent on player choice. A &quot;harem ending&quot; occurs in works where the protagonist ends together in a polyamorous relationship with all of the suitors.

===&quot;Reverse&quot;===
While most harem works focus on a male protagonist with women or gay male suitors, &quot;reverse&quot; harem works focus on female protagonists courted by men or queer women.

===Same-sex relationships===
Although most harem works tend to be binary and heteronormative, works in the genre can contain characters of various gender identities and sexualities, including many yaoi and yuri harem works. An example of a same-sex harem anime would be &quot;Kyo Kara Maoh!&quot;, which features a male protagonist with male characters comprising his harem. Especially in dating sim visual novels, it has become increasingly common for harems to feature characters of multiple genders, with the player choosing whether to pursue an opposite- or same-sex relationship.

==Criticism==
Many harem works have fallen under criticism for unrealistic and often misogynistic portrayals of women and relationships. Female harem members frequently lack agency and personalities of their own, other than desire for the self-insert protagonist and one-dimensional visual and personality traits to differentiate them from other love interests. Critics have also argued that harem genre tropes around a passive protagonist effortlessly picking and choosing from multiple eager suitors furthers the mythos of men being entitled to female affection, and can lead impressionable male readers to react negatively to being rejected by women in real life.

<text>USS &quot;Trigger&quot; (SS-564), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the triggerfish.

Her keel was laid down on 24 February 1949 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 14 June 1951 sponsored by Mrs. Roy S. Benson, and commissioned on 31 March 1952.

== History ==

Following shakedown training off Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the attack submarine returned to her home port, New London, Connecticut, and participated in local operations for the remainder of the year. She was back in the Caribbean Sea in February, returned to New London on 28 March, and continued East Coast operations until 16 August 1957. She then joined submarine and proceeded to the Arctic Ocean. The submarine spent ten days at the ice pack in the north Greenland Sea and made several short trips under the ice pack. From 16 September to 1 October, she participated in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Operation &quot;Strikeback&quot;. She then called at Portland, England and Le Havre, France, en route back to New London to resume normal operations.

On 14 January 1958, &quot;Trigger&quot; entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine for major alterations. Her four troublesome high-speed diesel engines were replaced by three reliable medium-speed engines. The submarine was cut in two and lengthened by nine feet to accommodate the large, easier-to-maintain engines. On 15 August, she got underway for New London and refresher training. She stood out of New London on 2 February 1959 for extended operations in the North Atlantic. She called at Faslane, Scotland, and returned to her home port in late April.

On 1 August, &quot;Trigger&quot; joined SubRon4 at Charleston, S.C. her new home port and, in late September and early October, participated in NATO Exercise &quot;Fishplay&quot;. The submarine conducted operations out of Charleston for the next decade. In 1964 she was overhauled in the Charleston shipyard with an emergency blow of straight 3000 psi air bypassing reducing valves. During the shakedown cruise to test the emergency blow from 150 feet her sail forced the boat to list almost 90 degrees to port and swung back to almost 90 degrees to a starboard list. No damage to the safety of the crew was encountered.

She was deployed to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean during the periods: 10 April to 6 August 1962; 7 July to 29 October 1966; and 7 October 1969 to 2 February 1970. From 6 January to 6 August 1964, she underwent modifications in connection with the SUBSAFE program; and, from 3 January 1968 to 6 June 1969, her hull was again lengthened to accommodate the PUFFS sonar equipment.

On 10 August 1970, &quot;Trigger&quot; departed Charleston for the west coast and assignment to the Pacific Fleet. She called at Montego Bay, Rodman, and Acapulco en route, and arrived at San Diego, California, her new home port, on 6 September to join SubRon 3. On 18 November, the submarine got underway for Bangor, Washington, to spend a month testing the Mark 48 torpedo. From 3 March to 7 June 1971, &quot;Trigger&quot; returned to Bangor to participate in Mk 48 Torpedo Selection Test Plan operations. Following yard work at the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard from July 1971 to April 1972, she made a voyage to the Nanoose Bay Acoustic Test Range and returned to San Diego on 25 May.

On 17 October, &quot;Trigger&quot; stood out to sea on her first WestPac deployment. She called at Christmas Island on 31 October and arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, on 10 November. The operational control of &quot;Trigger&quot; was shifted to the Commander, Seventh Fleet; and she participated in Exercise &quot;Longex 7,&quot; a combined fleet problem utilizing ships from the navies of the United States, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. The submarine departed Auckland on 1 December and arrived at Subic Bay on 18 December. From 29 December 1972 until 25 January 1973, &quot;Trigger&quot; was underway conducting special submarine operations. She left the Philippines on 3 February and, after calling at Hong Kong, participated in a joint United States-Canadian exercise off Taiwan. The ship sailed for Yokosuka on 20 February and remained in Japan undergoing repairs until getting underway for the United States on 16 March.

The submarine arrived at San Diego, California, on 5 April. On 25 June, she started training a crew of the &quot;Marina Militare&quot; to operate the ship. &quot;Trigger&quot; was decommissioned and transferred to Italy on 10 July 1973. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 July 1973.

<doc id="475294" wikidata="Q1890437" url="?curid=475294" title="Symbol table">
<text>In computer science, a symbol table is a data structure used by a language translator such as a compiler or interpreter, where each identifier, symbol, constant, procedure and function in a program&#x27;s source code is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the source. In other words, the entries of a symbol table store the information related to the entry&#x27;s corresponding symbol.

==Background==
A symbol table may only exist in memory during the translation process, or it may be embedded in the output of the translation, such as in an ABI object file for later use. For example, it might be used during an interactive debugging session, or as a resource for formatting a diagnostic report during or after execution of a program.

==Description==
The minimum information contained in a symbol table used by a translator and intermediate representation (IR) includes the symbol&#x27;s name and its location or address. For a compiler targeting a platform with a concept of relocatability, it will also contain relocatability attributes (absolute, relocatable, etc.) and needed relocation information for relocatable symbols. Symbol tables for high-level programming languages may store the symbol&#x27;s type: string, integer, floating-point, etc., its size, and its dimensions and its bounds. Not all of this information is included in the output file, but may be provided for use in debugging. In many cases, the symbol&#x27;s cross-reference information is stored with or linked to the symbol table. Most compilers print some or all of this information in symbol table and cross-reference listings at the end of translation.

==Implementation==
Numerous data structures are available for implementing tables. Trees, linear lists and self-organizing lists can all be used to implement a symbol table. The symbol table is accessed by most phases of a compiler, beginning with lexical analysis, and continuing through optimization.

A compiler may use one large symbol table for all symbols or use separated, or hierarchical symbol tables for different scopes. For example, in a scoped language such as Algol or PL/I a symbol &quot;p&quot; can be declared separately in several procedures, perhaps with different attributes. The scope of each declaration is the section of the program in which references to &quot;p&quot; resolve to that declaration. Each declaration represents a unique identifier &quot;p&quot;. The symbol table must have some means of differentiating references to the different &quot;p&quot;s.

A common data structure used to implement symbol tables is the hash table. The time for searching in hash tables is independent of the number of elements stored in the table, so it is efficient for a large number of elements. It also simplifies the classification of literals in tabular format by including the classification in calculation of the hash key.

As the lexical analyser spends a great proportion of its time looking up the symbol table, this activity has a crucial effect on the overall speed of the compiler. A symbol table must be organised in such a way that entries can be found as quickly as possible. Hash tables are usually used to organise a symbol table, where the keyword or identifier is &#x27;hashed&#x27; to produce an array subscript. Collisions are inevitable in a hash table, and a common way of handling them is to store the synonym in the next available free space in the table.

==Applications==
An object file will contain a symbol table of the identifiers it contains that are externally visible. During the linking of different object files, a linker will identify and resolve these symbol references. Usually all undefined external symbols will be searched for in one or more object libraries. If a module is found that defines that symbol it is linked together with the first object file, and any undefined external identifiers are added to the list of identifiers to be looked up. This process continues until all external references have been resolved. It is an error if one or more remains unresolved at the end of the process.

While reverse engineering an executable, many tools refer to the symbol table to check what addresses have been assigned to global variables and known functions. If the symbol table has been stripped or cleaned out before being converted into an executable, tools will find it harder to determine addresses or understand anything about the program.

==Example==

Consider the following program written in C:

// Declare an external function
extern double bar(double x);

// Define a public function
double foo(int count)
 double sum = 0.0;

 // Sum all the values bar(1) to bar(count)
 for (int i = 1; i &lt;= count; i++)
 sum += bar((double) i);
 return sum;


A C compiler that parses this code will contain at least the following symbol table entries:
In addition, the symbol table may also contain entries generated by the compiler for intermediate expression values (e.g., the expression that casts the codice_1 loop variable into a codice_2, and the return value of the call to function codice_3), statement labels, and so forth.

==Example: SysV ABI==

An example of a symbol table can be found in the SysV Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification, which mandates how symbols are to be laid out in a binary file, so that different compilers, linkers and loaders can all consistently find and work with the symbols in a compiled object.

The SysV ABI is implemented in the GNU binutils&#x27; nm utility. This format uses a sorted memory address field, a &quot;symbol type&quot; field, and a symbol identifier (called &quot;Name&quot;).

The symbol types in the SysV ABI (and nm&#x27;s output) indicate the nature of each entry in the symbol table. Each symbol type is represented by a single character. For example, symbol table entries representing initialized data are denoted by the character &quot;d&quot; and symbol table entries for functions have the symbol type &quot;t&quot; (because executable code is located in the &quot;text&quot; section of an object file). Additionally, the capitalization of the symbol type indicates the type of linkage: lower-case letters indicate the symbol is local and upper-case indicates external (global) linkage.

== Example: the Python symbol table ==
The Python programming language includes extensive support for creating and manipulating symbol tables. Properties that can be queried include whether a given symbol is a free variable or a bound variable, whether it is block scope or global scope, whether it is imported, and what namespace it belongs to.

== Example: Dynamic symbol tables ==
Some programming languages allow the symbol table to be manipulated at run-time, so that symbols can be added at any time. Racket is an example of such a language.

Both the LISP and the Scheme programming languages allow arbitrary, generic properties to be associated with each symbol.

The Prolog programming language is essentially a symbol-table manipulation language; symbols are called &quot;atoms&quot;, and the relationships between symbols can be reasoned over. Similarly, OpenCog provides a dynamic symbol table, called the &quot;atomspace&quot;, which is used for knowledge representation.

<doc id="475296" wikidata="Q1250245" url="?curid=475296" title="Bre-X">
<text>Bre-X was a group of companies in Canada. Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a major part of Bre-X based in Calgary, was involved in a major gold mining scandal when it reported it was sitting on an enormous gold deposit at , East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Bre-X bought the Busang site in March 1993 and in October 1995 announced significant amounts of gold had been discovered, sending its stock price soaring. Originally a penny stock, its stock price reached a peak at CAD$286.50 (split adjusted) in May 1996 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), with a total capitalization of over CAD $6 billion. Bre-X Minerals collapsed in 1997 after the gold samples were found to be fraudulent.

Busang&#x27;s gold resource was estimated by Bre-X&#x27;s independent consulting company, Kilborn Engineering (a division of SNC-Lavalin of Montreal), to be approximately . Reports of resource estimates of up to were never made by Bre-X though the property was described as having this potential by , Bre-X&#x27;s vice-president for Exploration, in an interview with Richard Behar of &quot;&quot;Fortune&quot; magazine.

Bre-X&#x27;s gold resource at Busang was a massive fraud. Encouraging gold values were intersected in many drill-holes and the project received a positive technical assessment by Kilborn. Crushed core samples that had been subjected to mineralogical examination by Bre-X&#x27;s consultants turned out to have been falsified by salting with gold. In fact in an old report, found in Bre-X files, a mineralogist had reported that some gold particles in Busang samples had the darker yellow skin compared to the interior and some had delicate morphologies composed of electrum. The yellow rims result from selective leaching of silver from the surface of gold particle during river transport or during supergene (in-situ) processes. Electrum is inconsistent with an alluvial origin. The mineralogy gave no indication that it was alluvial gold and was consistent with the assumed origin of the samples. None of the mineralogists who studied the gold grains gave any indication that the gold was not consistent with a hard rock origin. The salting of crushed core samples with gold constitutes the most elaborate fraud in the history of mining. In 1997, Bre-X collapsed and its shares became worthless in one of the biggest stock scandals in Canadian history, and the biggest mining scandal of all time.

==History==

David Walsh founded Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 as a subsidiary of Bresea Resources Ltd. The company did not make a significant profit before 1993, when Walsh followed the advice of geologist John Felderhof and bought a property in the middle of a jungle near the Busang River in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The first estimate of the site by its project manager (Filipino geologist Michael de Guzman) was approximately 2 million troy ounces.

The estimate of the site&#x27;s worth increased over time; in 1995 it was 30 million ounces (850 metric tons); in 1996, 60 million (1,700 metric tons); finally, in 1997, 70 million ounces. The stock was originally listed on the Alberta Stock Exchange in 1989, and subsequently in 1996 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The stock price of Bre-X rose to CA$280 per share by 1997 (split adjusted) and at its peak it had a market capitalization equal to US$4.4 billion, equivalent to US$ billion in .

Some other mineral companies, including Placer Dome, organized failed takeovers, but the Indonesian government of President Suharto also got involved. Stating that a small company like Bre-X could not exploit the site by itself, the Indonesians initially suggested that Bre-X share the site with the large Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold, in association with Suharto&#x27;s daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana. Bre-X hired Suharto&#x27;s son Sigit Hardjojudanto to handle their side of the affair. Bob Hasan, another Suharto acquaintance, negotiated a deal whereby Bre-X would have a 45% share, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold would run the mine, and Hasan would get a cut as well. Bre-X would have the land rights for 30 years. The deal was announced February 17, 1997 and Freeport-McMoRan began their initial due diligence evaluation of the site.

==Fraud exposed==
The fraud began to unravel rapidly beginning on March 19, 1997, when Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman reportedly died of suicide by jumping from a helicopter in Indonesia. A body was found four days later in the jungle, missing the hands and feet, &quot;surgically removed&quot;. In addition, the body was reportedly mostly eaten by animals. According to journalist John McBeth, a body had gone missing from the morgue of the town from which the helicopter flew. The remains of &quot;de Guzman&quot; were found only 400 metres from a logging road. No one saw the body except another Filipino geologist who claimed it was de Guzman. And one of the five women who considered themselves to be his wife was receiving monetary payments from somebody long after the supposed death of de Guzman.

A week later, on March 26, 1997, the American firm Freeport-McMoRan, a prospective partner in developing Busang, announced that its own due-diligence core samples, led by Australian geologist Colin Jones, showed &quot;insignificant amounts of gold&quot;. A frenzied sell-off of shares ensued and Suharto postponed signing the mining deal. Bre-X demanded more reviews and commissioned a review of the test drilling. Results were not favorable to them, and on April 1, 1997, Bre-X refused to comment. Canadian gold analyst Egizio Bianchini, of BMO Nesbitt Burns, considered the rumors &quot;preposterous&quot;. An independent company, Strathcona Minerals, was brought in to make its own analysis. They published their results on May 4, 1997: the Busang ore samples had been salted with gold dust. The lab&#x27;s tests showed that gold in one hole had been shaved off gold jewellery though it has never been proved at what stage it had been added to those samples. This gold also occurred in quantities that did not support the original assays. Trading in Bre-X was soon suspended on the TSE and NASDAQ, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection.

==Aftermath==
By May, Bre-X faced a number of lawsuits and angry investors who had lost billions. Among the major losers were three Canadian public sector organizations: The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (loss of $45 million), the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Quebec Public Sector Pension fund ($70 million), and the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan ($100 million). There was fallout in the Canadian financial sector also; the fraud proved a major embarrassment for Peter Munk, the head of Barrick Gold, as well as for the then-head of the Toronto Stock Exchange (resulting in his ousting by 1999), and began a tumultuous realignment of the Canadian stock exchanges.

Bre-X declared bankruptcy on November 5, 1997 although some of its subsidiaries continued until 2003.

Walsh moved to the Bahamas in 1998, still professing his innocence. Two masked gunmen broke into his home in Nassau, tying him up, and threatened to shoot him unless he turned over all his money. The incident ended peacefully but three weeks later, on June 4, 1998, Walsh died of a brain aneurysm.

In 1999 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced it was ending its investigation without laying criminal charges against anyone. Critics charged that the RCMP was underfunded and understaffed to handle complex criminal fraud cases, and also charged that Canadian laws in this area were inadequate. However, despite the dropping of criminal charges, civil class action suits against Bre-X directors, advising financial firms and Kilborn continued.

In May 1999, the Ontario Securities Commission charged Felderhof with insider trading. No other member of Bre-X&#x27;s board of directors or others associated with the Busang project were charged by the OSC. The OSC admitted that there was no evidence that Felderhof was either involved in the fraud or was aware of the fraud. The trial was suspended in April 2001 when the OSC tried to have presiding judge Justice Peter Hryn removed for alleged bias against the prosecution. This was denied by an independent judge, and on December 10, 2003, the appeal was also denied by a panel of judges.

The trial resumed in 2005. Felderhof attended a number of the Court hearings as the six-year case made its way through the system. The basis of the OSC action as well as the civil class-action suits was the alleged existence of numerous and obvious &quot;red flags&quot;, as detailed by Strathcona Minerals, which should have been recognized.

Begun in 2001, the trial of Felderhof was concluded on July 31, 2007, with a not-guilty verdict of insider trading. Days after the verdict, the OSC also decided not to appeal the decision, a victory for Felderhof and his lawyer, Toronto-based Joseph Groia. A class-action lawsuit was discontinued by court order in early 2014; $3.5 million (CAN) damages were donated to charity and the University of Ottawa since funds were deemed too low to be meaningfully distributed among the large number of plaintiffs.

Felderhof passed away on October 28, 2019, in Manila, Philippines, at the age of 79.

The Bre-X mining fraud convinced Canadians to regulate professional geology in Canada. The Securities regulation National Instrument 43-101 was created in the wake of the Bre-X fraud to protect investors from unsubstantiated mineral project disclosures.

The film &quot;Gold&quot;, a dramatization derived from the Bre-X story, was released world-wide on January 27, 2017. For legal reasons, and to enhance the appeal of the film to American audiences, the film&#x27;s producers denied that the film was in any way connected to the Canadian Bre-X story.

<text>Dating sims, also known as dating simulation games, are a video game subgenre of simulation games with romantic elements. While resembling the visual novel genre in presentation, true dating sims utilize an additional statistical and time management layer in their gameplay. The player is given a specific amount of time on an in-game calendar, while scheduling dates, correctly answering questions, and performing various activities will increase a certain character&#x27;s attraction to the player until the player gains their love. The additional subgenre of erotic dating sims are a form of eroge, and include sexually graphic cutscenes. The idea that love can only be earned through time and attention has prompted concern that it oversimplifies romance and depicts a &quot;nice guy&quot; view that may lead to unrealistic expectations from women.

Dating sims, typically in the form of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games with a male protagonist and female supporting characters, are extremely popular in Japan, taking up a large fraction of the software market, but far less prominent elsewhere. In Western gaming media, the &quot;dating sim&quot; label is often given to any game with romanceable characters, regardless of their gameplay. Parodic dating sims are a more recent phenomenon, poking fun at the genre by allowing the player to date unusual characters, such as realistic but sentient birds in &quot;Hatoful Boyfriend&quot;.

== History ==
The dating simulator genre was preceded by the raising simulation genre best codified by the &quot;Princess Maker&quot; series by Gainax, which focused on child raising rather than dating. Other games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Girl&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1985) and JAST&#x27;s &quot;Tenshitachi no Gogo&quot; (1985) include elements of dating sims, though they have more adventure/arcade gameplay.

One of the first games exclusively centered on dating was &quot;Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School&quot; (1987) released for the Famicom Disk System, about a boy trying to date a girl at his high school who looks like pop idol Miho Nakayama. Unlike more modern dating sims, the game&#x27;s plot is progressed through text choices, and as such plays more like graphical text adventures of the time (similar to games such as &quot;Famicom Detective Club&quot;.)

The first game which set the standard for the dating sim genre was &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; (1992), which relied more on timed events than dialogue choices. &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; (1994) truly popularized dating sims in Japan, in which the player, a high school student has the ability to date a dozen different girls. The goal of the developers was to hearken back to high school days. Konami director Akihiko Nagata said &quot;the person who created the game wanted to have experiences like this back in his high school days&quot;. The game was a strong hit in Japan, with 1.1 million copies by 1996.

In general, simulation games (such as &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;) or the train sim like &quot;Densha de Go!&quot; were more popular in Japan than in America which preferred more action oriented video games.

Games such as &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; (both series started in 1996, the latter would add dating sim elements in 2006) are RPGs with dating sim elements.

==Characteristics==
In a typical dating sim, the player controls a male avatar surrounded by female characters. The gameplay involves conversing with a selection of girls, attempting to increase their internal &quot;love meter&quot; through correct choices of dialogue. The game lasts for a fixed period of game time, such as one month or three years. When the game ends, the player either loses the game if he failed to properly win over any of the girls, or &quot;finishes&quot; one of the girls, often by having sex with her, marrying her (as in Magical Date), and/or achieving eternal love. This gives the games more replay value, since the player can focus on a different girl each time, trying to get a different ending.

Dating sims often revolve almost entirely around relationship-building, usually featuring complex character interactions and branching dialogue trees, and often presenting the player&#x27;s possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Dating sims such as &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;, and some role-playing games with similar relationship based mechanics to the genre such as &quot;Persona&quot;, often give choices that have a different number of associated &quot;mood points&quot; which influence a player character&#x27;s relationship and future conversations with a non-player character. These games often feature a day-night cycle with a time scheduling system that provides context and relevance to character interactions, allowing players to choose when and if to interact with certain characters, which in turn influences their responses during later conversations.

While bishōjo games make up the bulk of dating sims, other types of games exist. Games where the player character is female and potential objects of affection are male are known as GxB or otome games. Homosexual relationships are also possible, as there are games with no specific gender lines (&quot;all pairings&quot;). There are also girls&#x27; love games, which focus on female/female relationships, and boys&#x27; love games, which focus on male/male pairings.

There are many variations on this theme: high-school romances are the most common, but a dating sim may also take place in a fantasy setting and involve such challenges as defending one&#x27;s girl from monsters.

One game series that often includes dating, with the goal of marriage, is the farm life sim series &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;. The subplot of dating is more focused towards choosing one of several girls or guys (dependent on the player character&#x27;s gender) and offering them presents or joining them on events in the game. The &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series of RPGs also feature dating sim elements in a similar manner.

Some Japanese dating sims may allow the player to have romantic or sexual relationships with characters in their teens. The degree of sexual content varies, but may often include intercourse. Sexually explicit dating sims may fall into the category of H Game or Eroge. Eroge only gets released to PC because large Japanese game companies do not want to release games with sexual content on their game consoles. Because of this, Eroge companies make a censored all-ages (15+) version of the PC version for various consoles. Censored versions often contain additional endings and added scenes to compensate for the absence of sexual scenes.

These games also often involve raising stats that reflect the player&#x27;s skills and can be combined with other genres. Series such as &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; combine role-playing game (RPG) gameplay with dating sim gameplay.

<text>Lost in a Good Book is an alternate history fantasy novel by Jasper Fforde. It won the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association 2004 Dilys Award. It is the second in the Thursday Next series.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot; is the second book by Jasper Fforde and the sequel to the first adventure of literary detective Thursday Next, &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;. &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot; uses a variety of literary allusions as it follows Thursday through a vast government conspiracy.

==Plot summary==

Three months after the events of &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, Thursday Next is happily married to Landen Parke-Laine and working as a literary detective in Swindon. One day, Thursday meets her father, a renegade ChronoGuard, who informs her that the world&#x27;s going to end in a flood of an unknown pink chemical. This is a result of one of her uncle Mycroft&#x27;s inventions going out of control. Mycroft has destroyed his Prose Portal after the events of &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; and retired, leaving the invention business in the hands of his two well-meaning but inept sons, Orville and Wilbur.

Thursday is sent with her partner, Bowden Cable, to the mansion of Lord Volescamper, a major supporter of the front-runner in the up-coming election for President. In his extensive library, they discover an original manuscript of Shakespeare&#x27;s lost play &quot;Cardenio&quot;. Tests done at the station determine its authenticity, and it seems to have appeared just in time to help its discoverer, Yorrick Kaine, to win the election (thanks to the &quot;Shakespeare vote&quot;). When he releases the play to the general public, victory is all but guaranteed.

Thursday had marooned Jack Schitt in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot; at the end of &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, and his employer, The Goliath Corporation, a Big Brother-like agency which is the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of England, wants him back. They hire a ChronoGuard agent named Lavoisier to eradicate Thursday&#x27;s husband Landen from the time line, as a hostage to blackmail Thursday into retrieving Schitt. Landen vanishes, and only Thursday remembers him. But she also has physical proof—she&#x27;s pregnant with their child. Without Mycroft&#x27;s Prose Portal, however, she&#x27;ll have to learn a new way to travel between books.

During one of her dreams, she encounters Landen in her memory, who spurs her to travel to Osaka to meet Mrs. Nakajima, a woman who&#x27;s learned how to travel through books. Mrs Nakajima introduces her to bookjumping, the method by which one enters the fictional world without the Prose Portal: those with an inherent talent for it can literally read themselves into the world of fiction and Thursday does so. It turns out that there is a police force within literature (both fiction and non-fiction), Jurisfiction, which employs both fictional characters and real people ranging from the Cheshire cat and the Red Queen to Ambrose Bierce and Voltaire, and ensures that literature continues in an orderly fashion. Next herself is apprenticed as a rookie Jurisfiction agent to Miss Havisham, the abandoned bride from Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Thursday is, however, in some legal trouble in the literary world for having changed the ending of Jane Eyre, in &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;.

After a preliminary hearing in the Byzantine world of Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; and saving Abel Magwitch from drowning before the beginning of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Havisham and Thursday part ways and the latter character enters &quot;The Raven&quot; and retrieves Jack Schitt. But Goliath have no intention of keeping their word, and they trap Thursday in a Corporation warehouse without any reading material with which she can read herself out. Miss Havisham finds her there when it&#x27;s discovered that the copy of &quot;Cardenio&quot; which Thursday found in the real world was stolen from the Great Library (a building where copies of every book ever written or conceived of are kept) by another literary character. Miss Havisham uses one of Thursday&#x27;s clothing labels to read the pair (eventually and with great effort) back to the Great Library.

Guided through her dreams and memories by Landen, Thursday finds the event that caused the world-ending accident—or rather, the person: Aornis Hades, Acheron Hades&#x27; sister who wants revenge on Thursday for Acheron&#x27;s death in &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;. Aornis can edit people&#x27;s memories so they don&#x27;t remember her presence, which is why Thursday needed help from Landen to find Aornis in her own memory.

&quot;Cardenio&quot; is retrieved but Aornis escapes and now Goliath, the ChronoGuard, and SpecOps all seek to apprehend Thursday on Goliath&#x27;s contrived charge of stealing corporate secrets. At the book&#x27;s end, Aornis pressures Thursday to kill herself so that Aornis will prevent the world from turning into Dream Topping. Thursday&#x27;s father takes her place in the nick of time and sacrifices himself as Mycroft&#x27;s Dream Topping (see dream whip) making machine breaks down and begins producing the goo continuously; he takes all the Dream Topping to the dawn of Earth, where it—and he—will supply the organic nutrients needed to create life.

Afterwards, Thursday returns home and finds her father there. She is confused until she realizes that, being a time traveller, he will sacrifice himself much later in his future, even though it was just a little while ago in hers. Now that she is wanted by Goliath, the ChronoGuard, and Aornis, her father offers to place her in an alternate reality for a while (it is ironically implied that this is our reality) while she gives birth to Landen&#x27;s baby. Refusing her father&#x27;s offer, Thursday travels to a book in the Well of Lost Plots—a subdivision of the Great Library that contains unpublished and unfinished works—in order to take a year&#x27;s maternity leave with her memory of Landen. She establishes a home in a moored flying boat (a Short Sunderland), after trading places with the plucky sidekick sergeant of a police procedural mystery; it is implied that this is Sergeant Mary Mary, from one of Fforde&#x27;s other works, &quot;The Big Over Easy&quot;.

<doc id="475310" wikidata="Q1028209" url="?curid=475310" title="Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm">
<text>The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm is a deterministic quantum algorithm proposed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 with improvements by Richard Cleve, Artur Ekert, Chiara Macchiavello, and Michele Mosca in 1998. Although of little practical use, it is one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm.

The Deutsch–Jozsa problem is specifically designed to be easy for a quantum algorithm and hard for any deterministic classical algorithm. It is a black box problem that can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer with no error, whereas a deterministic classical computer would need an exponential number of queries to the black box to solve the problem. More formally, it yields an oracle relative to which [[EQP (complexity)|EQP]], the class of problems that can be solved exactly in polynomial time on a quantum computer, and [[P (complexity)|P]] are different.

Since the problem is easy to solve on a probabilistic classical computer, it does not yield an oracle separation with [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], the class of problems that can be solved with bounded error in polynomial time on a probabilistic classical computer. Simon&#x27;s problem is an example of a problem that yields an oracle separation between [[BQP]] and BPP.

== Problem statement ==
In the Deutsch–Jozsa problem, we are given a black box quantum computer known as an oracle that implements some function: 

formula_1 

The function takes n-bit binary values as input and produces either a 0 or a 1 as output for each such value. We are promised that the function is either constant (0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or &quot;balanced&quot; (1 for exactly half of the input domain and 0 for the other half). The task then is to determine if formula_2 is constant or balanced by using the oracle.

== Classical solution ==
For a conventional deterministic algorithm where formula_3 is the number of bits, formula_4 evaluations of formula_2 will be required in the worst case. To prove that formula_2 is constant, just over half the set of inputs must be evaluated and their outputs found to be identical (because the function is guaranteed to be either balanced or constant, not somewhere in between). The best case occurs where the function is balanced and the first two output values are different. For a conventional randomized algorithm, a constant formula_7 evaluations of the function suffices to produce the correct answer with a high probability (failing with probability formula_8 with formula_9). However, formula_10 evaluations are still required if we want an answer that has no possibility of error. The Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm produces an answer that is always correct with a single evaluation of formula_2.

==History==
The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm generalizes earlier (1985) work by David Deutsch, which provided a solution for the simple case where formula_12. 
Specifically, given a Boolean function whose input is one bit, formula_13, is it constant?

The algorithm, as Deutsch had originally proposed it, was not deterministic. The algorithm was successful with a probability of one half. 
In 1992, Deutsch and Jozsa produced a deterministic algorithm which was generalized to a function which takes formula_3 bits for its input. Unlike Deutsch&#x27;s algorithm, this algorithm required two function evaluations instead of only one.

Further improvements to the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm were made by Cleve et al., resulting in an algorithm that is both deterministic and requires only a single query of formula_2. This algorithm is still referred to as Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm in honour of the groundbreaking techniques they employed.

== Algorithm ==

For the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm to work, the oracle computing formula_16 from formula_17 must be a quantum oracle which does not decohere formula_17. In its computation, it cannot make a copy of formula_17, because that would violate the no cloning theorem. The point of view of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm of formula_2 as an oracle means that it does not matter what the oracle does, since it just has to perform its promised transformation.

The algorithm begins with the formula_21 bit state formula_22. That is, the first n bits are each in the state formula_23 and the final bit is formula_24. A Hadamard gate is applied to each bit to obtain the state

formula_25

where formula_17 runs over all formula_3-bit strings, which each may be represented by a number from formula_28 to formula_29. We have the function formula_2 implemented as a quantum oracle. The oracle maps its input state formula_31 to formula_32, where formula_33 denotes addition modulo 2. Applying the quantum oracle gives;

formula_34

For each formula_35 is either 0 or 1. Testing these two possibilities, we see the above state is equal to

formula_36

At this point the last qubit formula_37 may be ignored and the following remains:

formula_38

Next, we will have each qubit go through a Hadamard gate. The total transformation over all formula_3 qubits can be expressed with the following identity:

formula_40

(formula_41 is the sum of the bitwise product). This results in

formula_42

From this, we can see that the probability for a state formula_7 to be measured is

formula_44

The probability of measuring formula_45, corresponding to formula_46, is

formula_47

which evaluates to 1 if formula_16 is constant (constructive interference) and 0 if formula_16 is balanced (destructive interference). In other words, the final measurement will be formula_46 (all zeros) if and only if formula_16 is constant and will yield some other state if formula_16 is balanced.

== Deutsch&#x27;s algorithm==
Deutsch&#x27;s algorithm is a special case of the general Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm where n = 1 in formula_53. We need to check the condition formula_54. It is equivalent to check formula_55 (where formula_33 is addition modulo 2, which can also be viewed as a quantum XOR gate implemented as a Controlled NOT gate), if zero, then formula_2 is constant, otherwise formula_2 is not constant.

We begin with the two-qubit state formula_59 and apply a Hadamard gate to each qubit. This yields
formula_60

We are given a quantum implementation of the function formula_2 that maps formula_62 to formula_63. Applying this function to our current state we obtain
formula_64

We ignore the last bit and the global phase and therefore have the state
formula_65

Applying a Hadamard gate to this state we have
formula_66

formula_67 if and only if we measure formula_68 and formula_69 if and only if we measure formula_70. So with certainty we know whether formula_16 is constant or balanced.

==Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm Qiskit implementation==
The quantum circuit shown here is from a simple example of how the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm can be implemented in Python using Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing software development framework by IBM.

<text>Dr. Susan Calvin is a fictional character appearing in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series of science fiction short stories. According to &quot;I, Robot&quot;, Susan Calvin was born in the year 1982 and died at the age of 82, either in 2064 or 2065.

She was the chief robopsychologist at US Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., posited as the major manufacturer of robots in the 21st century. She was the main character in many of Asimov&#x27;s short stories concerning robots, which were later collected in the books &quot;I, Robot&quot; and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
According to Asimov&#x27;s fictional history of robotics, Susan Calvin was born in 1982, the same year that US Robots and Mechanical Men was incorporated. At 16, she wrote the first of many papers on robotics, a Physics-1 paper entitled &quot;Practical Aspects of Robotics&quot;. This was after attending a Psycho-Math seminar at which Dr Alfred Lanning of US Robots demonstrated the first mobile robot to be equipped with a voice. As quoted in &quot;I, Robot&quot;; &quot;Susan said nothing at that seminar; took no part in the hectic discussion period that followed. She was a frosty girl, plain and colorless, who protected herself against a world she disliked by a mask-like expression and a hypertrophy of intellect. But as she watched and listened, she felt the stirrings of a cold enthusiasm&quot;.

Graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in 2003, she began post-graduate work in cybernetics, learning to construct positronic brains such that responses to given stimuli could be accurately predicted. She joined US Robots in 2008 as their first Robopsychologist, having earned her PhD. By 2029, when she left Earth for the first time to visit Hyper Base, her formal title was Head Psychologist.

In Asimov&#x27;s stories, her emotionless brilliance is portrayed positively, when she solves issues with robots manufactured by her company. Usually, she is tripped up when she is swayed by emotion (as in &quot;Liar!&quot; and &quot;Lenny&quot;).

In the Mickey Zucker Reichert book &quot;I, Robot: To Protect&quot;, while working as a Psychiatrist in 2035, she was handed four cases; a traumatized girl that has not talked for 6 years, an obese boy that can&#x27;t stop eating, a teenaged girl with &quot;dementia, status post A-V fistula repair&quot;, and a 4-year-old girl accused of attempted murder.

Susan Calvin retired from US Robots in 2057 but continued to act as an occasional consultant for the company. She died in 2064, aged 82.

In &quot;Evidence&quot;, when asked, &quot;Are robots so different from men?&quot;, she replies, &quot;Worlds different. Robots are essentially &quot;decent&quot;&quot;. Asimov&#x27;s own stories leave her misanthropy largely unexplained, but Harlan Ellison&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; investigates its origins, and in the end concludes that her attitudes are rather well-founded.

An excerpt from Harlan Ellison&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; said of Calvin:

It was not until a mention of her in &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, Asimov&#x27;s third Elijah Baley Robot novel, that the events of her era (the 21st century) were concretely tied into those of Baley&#x27;s era, three millennia further into the future, and thus into the greater &quot;Foundation&quot; universe as a whole.

She was played by three separate actresses in British television, beginning in 1962 with Maxine Audley in an adaption of &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; for the TV series &quot;Out of This World&quot;, then later played by Beatrix Lehmann in the 1967 &quot;The Prophet&quot;, and followed by Wendy Gifford in 1969&#x27;s &quot;Liar!&quot; both being episodes in the series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. 

Ann Firbank portrayed the character serving the same function, renamed Inge Jensen, in the &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; adaptation of &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;. Margaret Robertson played her in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the same story.

A character named Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Marilyn Erskine) appears in the episode &quot;Sun Gold&quot; of the American anthology TV series &quot;Science Fiction Theater&quot;. Although the episode was not based on an Asimov story and does not feature robots, it is likely that the character name was a tribute to Asimov and his works.

Harlan Ellison&#x27;s script for a feature adaptation, begun in 1977 and finished in 1978, would have featured Susan Calvin prominently. The story presents Calvin as a legendary figure, now aged 82. Taking a cue both from the framing sequence of &quot;I, Robot&quot; and from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the film would have presented incidents from Calvin&#x27;s earlier life, in which she would figure prominently, even if absent in the original story. Ellison envisioned the role as a vehicle for Joanne Woodward. 

The 2004 film &quot;I, Robot&quot; was not originally based on Asimov&#x27;s but had an unrelated script, which was then retrofitted into an adaptation. Here, Calvin is played by Bridget Moynahan. She serves as an operative who &quot;makes the robots seem more human&quot; and dependent on the Three Laws of Robotics. She disbelieves Del Spooner&#x27;s claim that robots can be violent, then comes round to Spooner&#x27;s line of thinking and discovers that the robot Sonny had killed Dr. Alfred Lanning.

==References by other writers==
Arthur C. Clarke mentions Susan Calvin several times alongside Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper: In his novel &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; she appears as a female &quot;role-model&quot; in &quot;the battle of wits between man and machine&quot; (Chapter 36: Chamber of Horrors); in &quot;The Ghost from the Grand Banks&quot; Clarke refers to &quot;the small pantheon of famous women programmers&quot; while he puts one of the novel&#x27;s characters in a league with the three aforementioned ladies (Chapter 4: The Century Syndrome).
It is unclear whether Clarke is referring to Calvin in the sense of Asimov&#x27;s fictional character or as a character who existed in his fictional universe.

Susan Calvin also appears in David Wingrove&#x27;s illustrated book &quot;The Immortals of Science Fiction&quot;&quot;(1980). Here she is interviewed, along with nine other famous science fiction characters.

In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of &quot;Robots and Chaos&quot;, the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin and authored by fantasy author Mickey Zucker Reichert. The book was published in November, 2011 under the title &quot;I, Robot: To Protect.&quot;

<text>The ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata) is a species of turkey residing primarily in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, as well as in parts of Belize and Guatemala. A relative of the North American wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), it was sometimes previously considered in a genus of its own (&quot;Agriocharis&quot;), but the differences between the two turkeys are currently considered too small to justify generic segregation. It is a relatively large bird, at around long and an average weight of in females and in males.

The ocellated turkey lives only in a range in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico—which includes all or part of the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Yucatán, Tabasco, and Chiapas—as well as the northern and western parts of Belize and northern Guatemala.

The ocellated turkey was considered endangered by Mexican authorities as recently as 2002 and has been considered Near Threatened by the IUCN since 2004.

==Ecology==

The species is believed to have experienced a decline in response to land use changes and higher than sustainable harvest by migrant workers and subsistence hunters living in the Yucatán Peninsula region of Central America. A study conducted in the year 2011 indicated that the ocellated turkey made up a substantial amount of the diets of four prominent ethnic groups of the Yucatán Peninsula.

==Description==
The body feathers of both sexes are a mixture of bronze and green iridescent color. Although females can be duller with more green, the breast feathers do not generally differ and cannot be used to determine sex. Neither sex possesses the &quot;beard&quot; typically found in wild turkeys. Tail feathers of both sexes are bluish-grey with an eye-shaped, blue-bronze spot near the end with a bright gold tip. The spots, or &quot;ocelli&quot; (located on the tail), for which the ocellated turkey is named, have been likened to the patterning typically found on peafowl. The upper, major secondary wing coverts are rich iridescent copper. The primary and secondary wing feathers have similar barring to that of North American turkeys, but the secondaries have more white, especially around the edges.

Both sexes have blue heads with some orange or red nodules, which are more pronounced on males. The males also have a fleshy blue crown covered with nodules, similar to those on the neck, behind the snood. During breeding season this crown swells up and becomes brighter and more pronounced in its yellow-orange color. The eye is surrounded by a ring of bright red skin, which is most visible on males during breeding season. The legs are deep red and are shorter and thinner than on North American turkeys. Males over one year old have spurs on the legs that average , with lengths of over being recorded. These spurs are much longer and thinner than on North American turkeys.

Ocellated turkeys are much smaller than any of the subspecies of North American wild turkey, with adult hens weighing about before laying eggs and 3 kg (6–7 pounds) the rest of the year, and adult males weighing about during breeding season.

Vocalizations of the hen ocellated turkeys are similar to those of their northern relatives, however the male vocalization known as a &quot;gobble&quot; is quite different in comparison. The gobble begins with several low frequency &quot;thumps&quot;, much like the sound of a small gasoline motor starting. As the tempo of thumps increases, the typical gobble is produced. Branton and Berryhill (2007) have observed that the male ocellated turkey does not gobble &quot;per se&quot; like the wild turkey. Rather, his song is distinct and includes some six to seven bongo-like bass tones which quicken in both cadence and volume until a crescendo is reached whereupon the bird&#x27;s head is fully erect while he issues forth a rather high-pitched but melodious series of chops. The ocellated turkey will typically begin his singing 20 to 25 minutes before sunrise—similar to the wild turkey.

==Behavior==

Turkeys spend most of the time on the ground and during the day, they often prefer running to escape danger rather than taking off, though they can fly swiftly and powerfully for short distances when necessary, as typical of gamebirds. Roosting is usually high in trees away from night-hunting predators, such as jaguars, and usually in a family group.

The ocellated turkey is a generalist in terms of its feeding habits. They are known to feed on a wide variety of forage including but not limited to insects, such as beetles, moths, and leafcutter ants, grass seeds, nuts, and leaves. The feeding rates of male ocellated turkeys have been observed to be significantly higher during January before the breeding season begins than when the breeding season is in full swing. Prior to the breeding season, adult male turkeys have been observed in flocks usually no larger than three mature birds, whereas flocks of eight or more birds consisted of turkeys and hens.

The breeding season for the ocellated turkey begins in early February when the first gobbles are heard. The breeding season peaks in March and comes to an end by the end of April. Male ocellated turkeys engage in an elaborate, spirited display to attract females. Ocellated turkeys use their tail fans similar to North American turkeys; however, there are several distinct differences between the display of the ocellated and their North American cousins. Male turkeys begin the mating dance by tapping their feet against the ground in rapid succession. Next, the male birds move their tail feathers from side to side while quickly vibrating their wings and dragging the tips of them against the ground. As the male does this dance, he moves around the female making sure the dorsal surface of the tail feathers are constantly in view of the female. 

Female ocellated turkeys lay 8–15 eggs in a well concealed nest on the ground. The poults hatch in May through July after a 28-day incubation period. The poults are covered in a reddish brown juvenile plumage which allows them to blend into their surroundings to hide from predators. The young are precocial and able to leave the nest after one night. They then follow their mother until they reach young adulthood when they begin to range though often re-grouping to roost.

==In culture==
The Mayans (who call it &quot;kuuts&quot; or &quot;yuum kuuts&quot;) have a story where the turkey&#x27;s feathers were given to him by the nightjar who vouched for him to be anointed king of the birds by the Great Ancestor (&quot;Nohochacyum&quot;) in return for a reward. As the turkey completely forgot what he owed the nightjar, the latter complained to Nohochacyum who punished the former by changing his once-melodious voice to guttural thumps. It is associated with water, rain (especially through the deity Chaak) and fecundity; tribes like the Chʼortiʼ once offered its blood across their fields in hopes of a good harvest. Its carcasses were also offered to use by Mayan chiefs, even found in their tombs.

<text>In some religions, an exorcist (from the Greek „ἐξορκιστής“) is a person who is believed to be able to cast out the devil or performs the ridding of demons or other supernatural beings who are alleged to have possessed a person, or (sometimes) a building or object. An exorcist can be a specially prepared or instructed person including: priest, a nun, a monk, a witch doctor (healer), a shaman, a psychic or a geomancer (Feng shui - Chinese geomancy).

==Exorcists in various religions==
===Christianity===
In Christianity, exorcisms are a rite used to cast out demons from individuals deemed possessed. In training exorcists, ecumenical collaboration between Christians of various traditions, such as the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran and the Anglican denominations has occurred, as with a May 2019 exorcists&#x27; conference in Rome.

====Catholicism====
In a Roman Catholic context, &quot;exorcist&quot; may refer to a cleric who has been ordained into the minor order of exorcist, or a priest who has been mandated to perform the rite of solemn exorcism.

=====Minor order of exorcist=====

Since at least the third century, the Latin Church has formally ordained men to the minor order of exorcist. Text previously attributed to a fourth Council of Carthage (398), now identified as a collection called &quot;Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua&quot;, prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, &quot;Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on , whether baptized or catechumens&quot;.

These exorcists routinely performed ceremonies over adults and infants preparatory to baptism. Authors such as Eusebius (3rd century) and Augustine (4th century) provide details of these minor exorcisms: Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer. Augustine noted that rites of exorcism by exsufflation (breathing upon the candidate) were also performed for the baptism of infants.

The office of Exorcist was not a part of the sacrament of Holy Orders but as a sacramental was instead first conferred on those who had the special charism to perform its duties and later to those studying for the priesthood. As a minor order, exorcists wore the surplice.

In 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as Catholic priests or deacons would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of lector and acolyte were retained, but redesignated as &quot;ministries&quot;. It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a &quot;ministry of exorcist&quot; if it seemed useful in that nation.

The rite of conferral continues in societies that use the 1962 (or earlier) form of the Roman Rite, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter, Society of St. Pius X, and also among groups not in communion with the current bishop of Rome, such as the Society of St Pius V. Some believe that attainment of the position of Acolyte in post-Council practices implies ordination to the minor orders which used to be below it, such as Exorcist and Porter, although this has not been officially defined (although Canon Law section 1009 does specifically state that the only &quot;orders are the episcopate, the priesthood and the diaconate&quot;).

The Eastern Churches did not establish a minor order of exorcist, but simply recognised the calling of lay or ordained members of the faithful who had the appropriate spiritual gifts. In principle, every Christian has the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ.

=====Mandated Exorcists=====

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: &quot;Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing&quot;. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly stated that the solemn exorcism of a person believed to be possessed may only be performed with the express authorisation of the local bishop or equivalent; &quot;this permission is only to be given to priests of the highest repute&quot;. The revised 1983 Code of Canon Law similarly stated that the bishop is &quot;to give this permission only to a presbyter who has piety, knowledge, prudence, and integrity of life.&quot;

The Catholic Church&#x27;s Rite of Exorcism was revised in 1999. Paragraph 13 of its introduction states that a priest can be appointed by the local Bishop either for a single act of exorcism, or to the permanent position of &#x27;exorcist&#x27;. The Rite then specifies that whenever it uses the word &quot;exorcist&quot; without qualification, it indicates a priest mandated in this way.
Among notable exorcists, Gabriele Amorth served as chief exorcist of the Diocese of Rome; he was the founder of the International Association of Exorcists.

====Lutheranism====
In Lutheranism, exorcists practice the &quot;extensive ministry of casting out evil spirits ... in the name of Christ.&quot; In Madagascar, where the Malagasy Lutheran Church has territorial jurisdiction, the demand for exorcisms is quite high and pastors from sister Lutheran Churches, such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod have brought the education they gleaned while training in Madagascar back to the United States.

====Anglicanism====
In the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion, every diocese has an exorcist.

===Hinduism ===
Beliefs and practices pertaining to the practice of exorcism are prominently connected with the ancient Dravidians in the south. Of the four Vedas (holy books of the Hindus), the Atharva Veda is said to contain the secrets related to magic and medicine. Many of the rituals described in this book are for casting out demons and evil spirits. These beliefs are particularly strong and practiced in West Bengal, Odisha and southern states like Kerala.

Vaishnava traditions also employ a recitation of names of Lord Narasimha and reading scriptures (notably Bhagavata Purana) aloud. According to Gita Mahatmya of Padma Purana, reading the 3rd, 7th and 8th chapter of Bhagavad Gita and mentally offering the result to departed persons helps them to get released from their ghostly situation. Kirtan, continuous playing of mantras, keeping scriptures and holy pictures of the deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti etc. but especially of Narasimha) in the house, burning incense offered during a puja, sprinkling water from holy rivers, and blowing conches used in &quot;puja&quot; are other effective practices.

Main Puranic resource on ghost- and death-related information is Garuda Purana.

<doc id="475324" wikidata="Q3595765" url="?curid=475324" title="The Story of Civilization">
<text>The Story of Civilization (1935–1975), by husband and wife Will and Ariel Durant, is an eleven-volume set of books covering both Eastern and Western civilizations for the general reader, with a particular emphasis on European (Western) history. 

The series was written over a span of four decades. 

The first six volumes of &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; are credited to Will Durant alone, with Ariel recognized only in the acknowledgements. Beginning with &quot;The Age of Reason Begins&quot;, Ariel is credited as a co-author. In the preface to the first volume, Durant states his intention to make the series in five volumes, although this would not turn out to be the case.

The series won a Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 with the tenth volume in the series, &quot;Rousseau and Revolution&quot;.

The volumes were best sellers and sold well for many years. Sets of them were frequently offered by book clubs. An unabridged audiobook production of all eleven volumes was produced by the Books on Tape company and was read by Alexander Adams (also known as Grover Gardner).

James H. Breasted&#x27;s review of the first volume was highly negative. W. N. Brown was hardly more impressed. Henry James Forman, reviewing for The New York Times, found the first volume to be a masterpiece, as did the New York Herald Tribune. Michael Ginsberg was favorably disposed to the second volume, as was Edmund C. Richards. Reviews of the second volume from Time and Boston Evening Transcript were very positive. J.W. Swain noted in reviewing the third volume the book was written for a popular audience rather than scholars, and was successful at that. A review of the third volume in &quot;Time&quot; was positive. John Day published a mixed review of the third volume. Ralph Bates posted a negative review of the third volume for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Sidney R. Packard, professor emeritus of history at Smith College, found the fourth volume to be quite good. Norman V. Hope had a similar impression. L.H.

Plumb found the eighth volume to be very poor, as did Stanley Mellon. Alfred J.

Plumb was scathing in reviewing the eleventh volume. Joseph I. Shulim took a similar view. Alfred J. Bingham had a mixed yet favorable opinion. A review in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; of the eleventh volume was very positive.

<doc id="475330" wikidata="Q373981" url="?curid=475330" title="Tahirid dynasty">
<text>The Tahirid dynasty (, ) was an Arabized Sunni Muslim dynasty of Persian dehqan origin that ruled as governors of Khorasan from 821 to 873 as well as serving as military and security commanders in Abbasid Baghdad until 891. The dynasty was founded by Tahir ibn Husayn, a leading general in the service of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun. For his support of al-Ma&#x27;mun in the Fourth Fitna, he was granted the governance of Khorasan.

The Tahirids, however, were not an independent dynasty—according to Hugh Kennedy: &quot;The Tahirids are sometimes considered as the first independent Iranian dynasty, but such a view is misleading. The arrangement was effectively a partnership between the Abbasids and the Tahirids.&quot; Indeed, the Tahirids were loyal to the Abbasid caliphs and in return enjoyed considerable autonomy; they were in effect viceroys representing Abbasid rule in Persia. The tax revenue from Khorasan sent to the caliphal treasury in Baghdad was perhaps larger than those collected previously.

==Rulers of Khurasan==
===Rise===
The founder of the Tahirid dynasty was Tahir ibn Husayn, a Sunni Persian of dehqan origin, who had played a major military role in the civil war between the rival caliphs al-Amin and al-Ma&#x27;mun. He and his ancestors had previously been awarded minor governorships in eastern Khorasan for their service to the Abbasids. In 821, Tahir was made governor of Khorasan, but he died soon afterwards. The caliph then appointed Tahir&#x27;s son, Talha, governor of Khorasan. Talha was unsuccessful in removing the Kharijites from Sistan, and following the death of the Kharijite leader, Hamza b. Adarak (d.828), the Tahirids occupied Zarang but never succeeded in collecting taxes in the surrounding countryside.

Tahir&#x27;s other son, Abdullah, was instated as the wali of Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula, and when Talha died in 828 he was given the governorship of Khorasan. Abdullah is considered one of the greatest of the Tahirid rulers, as his reign witnessed a flourishing of agriculture in his native land of Khorasan, popularity in the eastern lands of the Abbasid caliphate and expanding influence due to his experience with the western parts of the caliphate. A noted poet, he sympathized with all things Arabic.

The replacement of the Pahlavi script with the Arabic script in order to write the Persian language was done by the Tahirids in 9th century Khurasan.

===Fall===

Abdullah died in 844 and was succeeded by his son Tahir II. Not much is known of Tahir&#x27;s rule, but the administrative dependency of Sistan was lost to rebels during his governorship. Tahirid rule began to seriously deteriorate after Tahir&#x27;s son Muhammad ibn Tahir became governor, due to his carelessness with the affairs of the state and lack of experience with politics. Oppressive policies in Tabaristan, another dependency of Khorasan, resulted in the people of that province revolting and declaring their allegiance to the independent Zaydi ruler Hasan ibn Zayd in 864. In Khorasan itself, Muhammad&#x27;s rule continued to grow increasingly weak, and in 873 he was finally overthrown by the Saffarid dynasty, who annexed Khorasan to their own empire in eastern Persia.

==Governors of Baghdad==

Besides their hold over Khorasan, the Tahirids also served as the military governors (&quot;ashab al-shurta&quot;) of Baghdad, beginning with Tahir&#x27;s appointment to that position in 820. After he left for Khorasan, the governorship of Baghdad was given to a member of a collateral branch of the family, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, who controlled the city for over twenty-five years. During Ishaq&#x27;s term as governor, he was responsible for implementing the Mihna (inquisition) in Baghdad. His administration also witnessed the departure of the caliphs from Baghdad, as they made the recently constructed city of Samarra their new capital. When Ishaq died in 849 he was succeeded first by two of his sons, and then in 851 by Tahir&#x27;s grandson Muhammad ibn Abdallah.

Abdallah played a major role in the events of the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; in the 860s, giving refuge to the caliph al-Musta&#x27;in and commanding the defense of Baghdad when it was besieged by the forces of the rival caliph al-Mu&#x27;tazz in 865. The following year, he forced al-Musta&#x27;in to abdicate and recognized al-Mu&#x27;tazz as caliph, and in exchange was allowed to retain his control over Baghdad. Violent riots plagued Baghdad during the last years of Abdallah&#x27;s life, and conditions in the city remained tumultuous after he died and was succeeded by his brothers, first Ubaydallah and then Sulayman. Eventually order was restored in Baghdad, and the Tahirids continued to serve as governors of the city for another two decades. In 891, however, Badr al-Mu&#x27;tadidi was put in charge of the security of Baghdad in place of the Tahirids, and the family soon lost their prominence within the caliphate after that.

==Language and culture==

The historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth explains that while the Tahirids were Persians, they were also highly Arabized in culture, and eager to be accepted in the caliphal world, where cultivation of things Arabic gave social and cultural prestige. Due to this, the Tahirids were not part of the renaissance of Early New Persian language and culture. He adds that the Persian language was at least tolerated in the entourage of the Tahirids, whereas the Saffarids played a leading part in the renaissance of Persian literature.

Centuries later, both &#x27;Aufi and Daulatshah wrote the Tahirids were hostile to Persian literature. &#x27;Abd-Allah b. Tahir ordered the Persian novel &quot;Vamiq-u Adhra&quot; &quot;The Ardent Lover and the Virgin&quot; (based on a Hellenistic novel) and other Persian and Zoroastrian works destroyed, according to Daulatshah.

However, according to the historian Shivan Mahendrarajah, in reference to the dynasties of the Iranian Intermezzo of which the Tahirids are considered part:
Within this context, Mahendrarajah adds that the Tahirids were specifically responsible for initiating the process by which Persian became written in the Perso-Arabic script, referring to this as &quot;an ingenious Iranian adaption that allowed them to retain the heritage and charm of the Persian language&quot;.

The Tahirids claimed descent from Rustam, the mythological Iranian hero.

The art historian Sheila Blair explains that the Tahirids may well have added Persian inscriptions to their (now non-extant) buildings.

<doc id="475335" wikidata="Q3855712" url="?curid=475335" title="Intrinsic metric">
<text>In the mathematical study of metric spaces, one can consider the arclength of paths in the space. If two points are at a given distance from each other, it is natural to expect that one should be able to get from the first point to the second along a path whose arclength is equal to (or very close to) that distance. The distance between two points of a metric space relative to the intrinsic metric is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all paths from the first point to the second. A metric space is a length metric space if the intrinsic metric agrees with the original metric of the space.

If the space has the stronger property that there always exists a path that achieves the infimum of length (a geodesic) then it is called a geodesic metric space or geodesic space. For instance, the Euclidean plane is a geodesic space, with line segments as its geodesics. The Euclidean plane with the origin removed is not geodesic, but is still a length metric space.

==Definitions==
Let formula_1 be a metric space, i.e., formula_2 is a collection of points (such as all of the points in the plane, or all points on the circle) and formula_3 is a function that provides us with the &quot;distance&quot; between points formula_4. We define a new metric formula_5 on formula_2, known as the induced intrinsic metric, as follows:
formula_7 is the infimum of the lengths of all paths from formula_8 to formula_9.

Here, a &quot;path&quot; from formula_8 to formula_9 is a continuous map 
:formula_12
with formula_13 and formula_14. The &quot;length&quot; of such a path is defined as explained for rectifiable curves. We set formula_15 if there is no path of finite length from formula_8 to formula_9 (this is consistent with the infimum definition since the infimum of the empty set within the closed interval [0,+∞] is +∞).

The mapping formula_18 is idempotent, i.e.

: formula_19

If
:formula_20
for all points formula_8 and formula_9 in formula_2, we say that formula_1 is a length space or a path metric space and the metric formula_25 is intrinsic.

We say that the metric formula_25 has approximate midpoints if for any formula_27 and any pair of points formula_8 and formula_9 in formula_2 there exists formula_31 in formula_2 such that formula_33 and formula_34 are both smaller than 
:formula_35

==Examples==
* Euclidean space formula_36 with the ordinary Euclidean metric is a path metric space. formula_37 is as well.
* The unit circle formula_38 with the metric inherited from the Euclidean metric of formula_39 (the chordal metric) is not a path metric space. The induced intrinsic metric on formula_38 measures distances as angles in radians, and the resulting length metric space is called the Riemannian circle. In two dimensions, the chordal metric on the sphere is not intrinsic, and the induced intrinsic metric is given by the great-circle distance.
* Every connected Riemannian manifold can be turned into a path metric space by defining the distance of two points as the infimum of the lengths of continuously differentiable curves connecting the two points. (The Riemannian structure allows one to define the length of such curves.) Analogously, other manifolds in which a length is defined included Finsler manifolds and sub-Riemannian manifolds.
* Any complete and convex metric space is a length metric space , a result of Karl Menger. However, the converse does not hold, i.e. there exist length metric spaces that are not convex.

== Properties ==
*In general, we have formula_41 and the topology defined by formula_5 is therefore always finer than or equal to the one defined by formula_25.
*The space formula_44 is always a path metric space (with the caveat, as mentioned above, that formula_5 can be infinite).
*The metric of a length space has approximate midpoints. Conversely, every complete metric space with approximate midpoints is a length space.
*The Hopf–Rinow theorem states that if a length space formula_46 is complete and locally compact then any two points in formula_2 can be connected by a minimizing geodesic and all bounded closed sets in formula_2 are compact.

<text>Pueblos jóvenes (, ) is the term used for the shanty towns that surround Lima and other cities of Peru. Many of these towns have developed into districts of Lima such as Comas, Los Olivos and Villa El Salvador.

== Population ==
Pueblos jóvenes were estimated to have over one million inhabitants in 1974. They were built on hillsides or beside rivers. By 2008, it was estimated that tens of millions of Peruvians were squatting land. Areas include Comas District, Los Olivos District and Villa El Salvador in Lima.

The shanty town of Medalla Milagrosa is composed of migrants from all over Peru. Others are populated by Black, Amerindian, and mestizo campesinos who since the 1940s have migrated in great waves from Peru&#x27;s countryside in search of economic opportunity, turning Lima into the fourth-largest city in America. Like many other rapidly industrializing cities, Lima&#x27;s job market has largely been unable to keep up with this influx of people, forcing many to accept any housing available. The Peruvian government has permitted these communities to continue largely because it realizes that, were they to eradicate them, the inhabitants would simply move elsewhere in the city&#x27;s peripheral areas.

<text>The supraorbital nerve is one of two terminal branches - the other being the supratrochlear nerve - of the frontal nerve (itself a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1)). It exits the orbit via the supraorbital foramen/notch before splitting into a medial branch and a lateral branch. It innervates the skin of the forehead, upper eyelid, and the root of the nose.

== Structure ==

=== Origin ===
The supraorbital nerve branches from the frontal nerve midway between the base and apex of the orbit.

=== Course ===
It travels anteriorly superior to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. It exits the orbit through the supraorbital foramen/notch in the superior margin orbit, exiting it lateral to the supratrochlear nerve. It then ascends onto the forehead deep to the corrugator supercilii muscle and frontalis muscles.

=== Fate ===
It divides into a medial branch and lateral branch - usually after emerging from the orbit, but sometimes already within the orbit.

=== Distribution ===
The supraorbital nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral forehead and upper eyelid, as well as the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and mucosa of the frontal sinus.

<doc id="475366" wikidata="Q3356529" url="?curid=475366" title="Pan (novel)">
<text>Pan is an 1894 novel by Norwegian author Knut Hamsun. He wrote it while living in Paris and in Kristiansand, Norway. It remains one of his most famous works.

==Plot summary==
Lieutenant Thomas Glahn, a hunter and ex-military man, lives alone in a hut in the forest with his faithful dog, Aesop. Upon meeting Edvarda, the daughter of a merchant in a nearby town, they are strongly attracted to each other, but neither understands the other&#x27;s love. Overwhelmed by the society of people where Edvarda lives, Glahn suffers a series of tragedies before he leaves forever.

==Symbolism==
The changing seasons are reflected in the plot: Edvarda and Glahn fall in love in spring; make love in the summer; and end their relationship in the autumn.

The contradicting symbols of culture and nature are important in the novel: Glahn belongs to nature, while Edvarda belongs to culture.

Much of what happens between Glahn and Edvarda is foreshadowed when Glahn dreams of two lovers. The lovers&#x27; conversations also foretell the future.

==Epilogue==
&quot;The Epilogue: Glahn&#x27;s Death&quot; is told from another person&#x27;s perspective. In the main narrative of the book, which is told in first person by Glahn, he sees himself as awkward and unattractive. The Epilogue shows that is not the case, instead from an outsider&#x27;s viewpoint Glahn is beautiful, talented and desired. Glahn has left Nordland and moved to India to be alone in the forest and to hunt, but he is suicidal because of his lost love, and when he can not bear it any longer he provokes the narrator of the Epilogue into shooting him.

==Film adaptations==
The novel has been adapted for film four times. The first was a Norwegian silent film directed by Harald Schwenzen in 1922. In 1937, a German-made version was produced under the sponsorship of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who considered Hamsun one of his favorite authors. Goebbels had initially attempted to get Greta Garbo for this film, but was unsuccessful, and he did not like the finished film, which became the first foreign film to be released in Norway with its soundtrack dubbed into Norwegian. The next version, a color production by the Swedish studio Sandrews, was directed by Bjarne Henning-Jensen and released in 1962 under the title &quot;Kort är sommaren&quot; (&quot;Summer is short&quot;). A Danish-Norwegian-German version, directed by Danish director Henning Carlsen, was released in 1995. The book is also the basis of Guy Maddin&#x27;s 1997 Canadian film &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot; and the primary inspiration for Ben Rivers&#x27; 2011 docufiction &quot;Two Years at Sea&quot;.

<doc id="475367" wikidata="Q1377791" url="?curid=475367" title="Robert Thurman">
<text>Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman (born August 3, 1941) is an American Buddhist author and academic who has written, edited, and translated several books on Tibetan Buddhism. He was the Je Tsongkhapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University, before retiring in June 2019. He was the first endowed chair in Buddhist Studies in the West. He also is the co-founder and president of the Tibet House US New York. He translated the Vimalakirti Sutra from the Tibetan Kanjur into English. He is the father of actress Uma Thurman.

==Early life and education==
Thurman was born in New York City, the son of Elizabeth Dean Farrar (1907–1973), a stage actress, and Beverly Reid Thurman, Jr. (1909–1962), an Associated Press editor and U.N. translator (French and English). He is of English, German, Scottish, and Scots-Irish/Northern Irish descent. His brother, John Thurman, is a professional concert cellist who performs with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy from 1954 to 1958, then went to Harvard University, where he obtained his B.A. in 1962. He later returned to Harvard for graduate study in Sanskrit, receiving an M.A. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1972.

In 1960, he married Marie-Christophe de Menil, daughter of Dominique de Menil and John de Menil and heiress to the Schlumberger Limited oil-equipment fortune. In 1961 Thurman lost his left eye in an accident while he was using a jack to lift an automobile, and the eye was replaced with an ocular prosthetic.

==Career==
After the accident Thurman decided to refocus his life, divorcing de Menil and traveling from 1961 to 1966 in Turkey, Iran and India. In India he taught English to exiled tulkus (reincarnated Tibetan lamas). After his father&#x27;s death in 1962, Thurman came back to the United States and in New Jersey met Geshe Wangyal, a Kalmyk Buddhist monk from Mongolia who became his first guru. Thurman became a Buddhist and went back to India where, due to Wangyal&#x27;s introduction, Thurman studied with Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. Thurman was ordained by the Dalai Lama in 1965, the first American Buddhist monk of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and the two became close friends.

In 1967, Thurman returned to the United States and renounced his monk status (which required celibacy) to marry his second wife, German-Swedish model and psychotherapist Nena von Schlebrügge, who was divorced from Timothy Leary. Thurman obtained an M.A in 1969 and a Ph.D. in Sanskrit Indian Studies in 1972 from Harvard. He was professor of religion at Amherst College from 1973 to 1988, when he accepted a position at Columbia University as professor of religion and Sanskrit. 

In 1986, Thurman created Tibet House US with Nena von Schlebrügge, Richard Gere and Philip Glass at the request of the Dalai Lama. Tibet House US is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to help preserve Tibetan Culture in exile. In 2001, the Pathwork Center, a retreat center on Panther Mountain in Phoenicia, New York, was donated to Tibet House US. Thurman and von Schlebrügge renamed the center Menla Retreat and Dewa Spa. Menla (the Tibetan name for the Medicine Buddha) was developed into a state-of-the-art healing arts center grounded in the Tibetan Medical tradition in conjunction with other holistic paradigms. In 2009, Thurman starred in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;History of Hell - Rosas Höllenfahrt&quot;.

==Ideas==
Thurman is known for translations and explanations of Buddhist religious and philosophical material, particularly that pertaining to the Gelugpa (dge-lugs-pa) school of Tibetan Buddhism and its founder, Je Tsongkhapa.

==Recognition and awards==
&quot;Time&quot; named Thurman one of the 25 most influential Americans of 1997. In 2003 he received the Light of Truth Award, a human rights award from the International Campaign for Tibet. New York Magazine named him as one of the &quot;Influentials&quot; in religion in 2006. In 2020 he was a recipient of India&#x27;s prestigious Padma Shri Award for literature and education.

Thurman is considered a pioneering, creative and talented translator of Buddhist literature by many of his English-speaking peers. Speaking of Thurman&#x27;s translation of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s &quot;Essence of Eloquence&quot; (&quot;Legs bshad snying po&quot;), Matthew Kapstein (professor at the University of Chicago and Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris) has written that, &quot;The &quot;Essence of Eloquence&quot; is famed in learned Tibetan circles as a text of unparalleled difficulty. ... To have translated it into English at all must be reckoned an intellectual accomplishment of a very high order. To have translated it to all intents and purposes correctly is a staggering achievement.&quot; Similarly, prominent Buddhologist Jan Nattier has praised the style of Thurman&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Vimalakīrti Sūtra&quot;, praising it as among the very best of translations of that important Indian Buddhist scripture.

==Personal life==

Twice married, Robert Thurman is the father of five children and grandfather to eight grandchildren. With Marie-Christophe de Menil, he has one daughter, Taya; their grandson was the artist Dash Snow. He also has a great-granddaughter through Snow. Robert and Nena Thurman have four children, including Ganden, who is executive director of Tibet House US, actress Uma Thurman, Dechen, and Mipam. Robert and Nena&#x27;s children grew up in Woodstock, NY, where the Thurmans had bought nine acres of land with a small inheritance Nena had received. The Thurmans built their own house there.

<doc id="475368" wikidata="Q948318" url="?curid=475368" title="Polycythemia vera">
<text>In oncology, polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the &quot;JAK2&quot; gene, most commonly resulting in a single amino acid change in its protein product from valine to phenylalanine at position 617.

Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells. It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin. Patients with polycythemia vera are more likely to have gouty arthritis. Treatment consists primarily of phlebotomy as well as oral chemotherapy and emerging treatments like long-acting interferon formulations.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with polycythemia vera can be asymptomatic. Clinical symptoms of polycythemia vera are mostly due to hyperviscosity of blood. A classic symptom of polycythemia vera is pruritus or itching, particularly after exposure to warm water (such as when taking a bath), which may be due to abnormal histamine release or prostaglandin production. Such itching is present in approximately 40% of patients with polycythemia vera. Gouty arthritis may be present in up to 20% of patients. Peptic ulcer disease is also common in patients with polycythemia vera; most likely due to increased histamine from mast cells, but may be related to an increased susceptibility to infection with the ulcer-causing bacterium &quot;H. pylori&quot;.

A classic symptom of polycythemia vera (and the related myeloproliferative disease essential thrombocythemia) is erythromelalgia. This is a burning pain in the hands or feet, usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin. Erythromelalgia is caused by an increased platelet count or increased platelet &quot;stickiness&quot; (aggregation), resulting in the formation of tiny blood clots in the vessels of the extremity; it responds rapidly to treatment with aspirin. Splenomegaly may cause the spleen to be palpable in some patients, which has been reported by Lee et al. (2022) to be associated with both the V617F mutation and the development of myelofibrosis.

==Pathophysiology==
Polycythemia vera (PV), being a primary polycythemia (increase in the fraction of volume occupied by red cells in the blood), is caused by neoplastic proliferation and maturation of erythroid, megakaryocytic and granulocytic elements to produce what is referred to as panmyelosis. In contrast to secondary polycythemias, PV is associated with a low serum level of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). Instead, PV cells often carry activating mutation in a tyrosine kinase–encoding gene, &quot;JAK2&quot;, which acts in signaling pathways of the EPO receptor, making those cells proliferate independently from EPO.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera were modified by the World Health Organization in 2016. The WHO criteria for polycythemia vera are specifically outlined in Table 4, and emphasis is given to accurate histological observations as proven predictors in the prognosis of the disease.

As summarized by Verstovek following the 2016 European Hematology Association Congress, there are 3 major criteria for PV diagnosis: 
# The first is a very high red blood cell count, which is usually identified by elevated levels of hemoglobin or hematocrit;
# A bone marrow biopsy that shows hypercellularity and abnormalities in megakaryocytes; and
# The presence of a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (&quot;JAK2&quot;) gene. 

Patients usually have a very low level of erythropoietin, a growth factor that increases the production of red blood cells, which may be considered a minor diagnostic feature. 

A mutation in the JAK2 kinase (V617F) is strongly associated with polycythemia vera. While it is a JAK2 V617F mutation in 95% of patients, &quot;JAK2&quot; exon 12 mutations have also been observed. The V617F mutation is not inherited, but develops as a somatic mutation in the erythroid progenitor cells. Some patients may lose the normal allele in the diseased cells entirely together with the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p), likely due to mitotic recombination causing copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. While the JAK2 V617F mutation is generally sporadic (random), a certain inherited haplotype of &quot;JAK2&quot; has been associated with its development.

People with untreated polycythemia vera have a substantial risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis).

==Treatment==
Untreated, polycythemia vera can be fatal, with the median survival in patients being 1.5-3 years. Data on the effect of life-span of an individual with treated polycythemia vera is inconclusive due to the rarity of the disease. Studies show the median survival rate of controlled Polycythemia Vera ranges from 10 to 20 years; however, most observations are of people diagnosed in their 60s. Patients live close to a normal life expectancy.

Frequent blood withdrawals (phlebotomy) are one form of treatment, which often may be combined with other therapies. The removal of blood from the body induces iron deficiency, thereby decreasing the hemoglobin / hematocrit level, and reducing the risk of blood clots. Phlebotomy is typically performed to bring their hematocrit (red blood cell percentage) down below 45 for men or 42 for women. It has been observed that phlebotomy also reduces cognitive impairment.

Medications are also used which reduce the number of red blood cells. These include hydroxyurea and interferon therapy, among others. The tendency of some practitioners to avoid chemotherapy if possible, especially in young patients, is a result of research indicating possible increased risk of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). While hydroxyurea is considered a safer chemotherapy in this aspect, there is still some debate about its long-term safety.

There are indications that the lung cancer drug erlotinib may be an additional treatment option for those with certain genetic markers.

Ruxolitinib (brand name Jakafi), a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, is also used to treat polycythemia.

Ropeginterferon alfa-2b (Besremi) was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2019, and in the United States in November 2021. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is the first medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat polycythemia vera that people can take regardless of their treatment history, and the first interferon therapy specifically approved for polycythemia vera. Interferon alfa-2b is also used.

==Epidemiology==
Polycythemia vera occurs in all age groups, although the incidence increases with age. One study found the median age at diagnosis to be 60 years, while a Mayo Clinic study in Olmsted County, Minnesota found that the highest incidence was in people aged 70–79 years. The overall incidence in the Minnesota population was 1.9 per 100,000 person-years, and the disease was more common in men than women. A cluster around a toxic site was confirmed in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.

==Notable deaths==
*Phyllis George (1949–2020), American sportscaster and former First Lady of Kentucky
*Ron Miles (1963–2022), American jazz trumpeter
*Nell Rankin (1924–2005), American mezzo-soprano

<doc id="475369" wikidata="Q277795" url="?curid=475369" title="A-F Records">
<text>A-F Records was an American independent record label founded by punk rock band Anti-Flag – namely the band&#x27;s drummer Pat Thetic, their rhythm guitarist Chris Head, and their lead vocalist Justin Sane – and based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was created to help expose more political punk bands to a larger audience.

== History ==
The band founded the label in 1997 so they could release their 1998 compilation album &quot;Their System Doesn&#x27;t Work for You&quot;. The compilation was the first official release under the label as well.

Following the release of their own compilation, the band approached the Pittsburgh-based band Reagan Squad and the Boston-based band The Unseen, both of whom they believed to be &quot;socially conscious,&quot; and the two bands released their own full-length LPs through A-F Records. The releases from Reagan Squad and The Unseen were the first non-Anti-Flag albums to be released by the label. Later, band then released &quot;East Coast Punk,&quot; a compilation featuring several bands that had worked with A-F Records, and stated that they donated the proceeds to a women&#x27;s shelter. Due to financial concerns, the band exclusively released the &quot;East Coast Punk&quot; compilation on cassette and distributed it at concerts put on by bands on their label.

The label&#x27;s offices were damaged when a September 2004 flood hit Pittsburgh. Although employees saved much of the equipment and inventory, A-F Records dropped Inhuman, Tabula Rasa, and Virus Nine in the wake of the flood for financial reasons.

The label&#x27;s music was formerly distributed on Mordam but moved to RedEye when Mordam was bought by Lumberjack in early 2006.

=== Dissolution ===
On July 19, 2023, Anti-Flag posted an update on their Patreon announcing their disbandment and the intention to refund fans who were subscribed. Following this announcement, their website was taken down, and the band&#x27;s social media accounts were deleted. When asked to offer a statement regarding the breakup, the band&#x27;s publicist declined to comment. &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Us Weekly&quot; linked Anti-Flag&#x27;s July 2023 breakup to a podcast episode released on July 19, the same day as the band&#x27;s dissolution, that leveled accusations of sexual assault against &quot;a singer in a political punk band&quot; believed to be frontman Justin Sane. In the following months, twelve more women and girls would come forward to accuse Sane of sexual misconduct, grooming, sexual assault, and rape.

Within days of Anti-Flag&#x27;s breakup, several bands announced their departure from A-F Records, including American Television, Celebration Summer, Darien Gap, Hanalei, Reconciler, Sammy Kay, and Wolves &amp; Wolves &amp; Wolves &amp; Wolves. Several of the bands&#x27; departures were mentioned in a September 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; exposé discussing the additional accusations against Sane. In the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; exposé, the band also informed the magazine that they were &quot;in the process of unwinding the label, including returning master rights and physical records/merchandise to the bands, which will take some time to complete properly.&quot;

<text>Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna Göteborg (officially IFK Göteborg Fotboll), commonly known as IFK Göteborg, IFK (especially locally) or simply Göteborg, is a Swedish professional football club based in Gothenburg. Founded in 1904, it is the only club in the Nordic countries that has won one of the main UEFA competitions, having won the UEFA Cup in both 1982 and 1987. IFK is affiliated with Göteborgs Fotbollförbund and play their home games at Gamla Ullevi. The club colours are blue and white, colours shared both with the sports society which the club originated from, Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna, and with the coat of arms of the city of Gothenburg. The team colours have influenced the historical nickname &quot;Blåvitt&quot;. The blue and white are in stripes, with blue shorts and socks.

Besides the two UEFA Cup titles, IFK have won 18 Swedish championship titles, second most in Swedish football after Malmö FF, and have the second most national cup titles with eight. The team has qualified for four group stages of the UEFA Champions League, and reached the semi-finals of the 1985–86 European Cup. IFK Göteborg is the only club team in any sport to have won the Jerring Award, an award for best Swedish sports performance of the year voted by the Swedish people, for the 1982 UEFA Cup victory. 

IFK Göteborg play in the highest Swedish league, Allsvenskan, where they have played for the majority of their history. They have played in the Swedish first tier continuously since 1977, which is the longest ongoing top-flight tenure in Sweden. The club won its first Swedish championship in 1908, four years after the founding, and has won at least one championship title in every decade since, except the 1920s, 1970s and 2010s. IFK Göteborg&#x27;s most successful period was from 1982 to 1996, when the team prospered in European football and won 10 out of 15 Swedish championships.

==History==
IFK Göteborg was founded on 4 October 1904, at Café Olivedal in the Annedal district of Linnéstaden in downtown Gothenburg. It was the third, but the only remaining, IFK association founded in Gothenburg, becoming the 39th overall. A committee for football was created at the historic first meeting; the association&#x27;s first football match ended in a 4–1 victory against another club from the area, IK Viking. The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important for the development of football in the city, as until that point, Örgryte IS, the largest of Gothenburg clubs, were dominant, with IFK Göteborg offering some needed competition.

In 1907, IFK Göteborg became the first Swedish team in four years to beat Örgryte IS. They then went on to win their first Swedish Championship in 1908 by winning the cup tournament Svenska Mästerskapet, and three players from the club were selected to play for Sweden in the national team&#x27;s first match. That year IFK played teams from outside Sweden for the first time, meeting the Danish clubs Østerbro BK and Boldklubben af 1893.

In 1910, the team played in blue and white striped jerseys for the first time. Two years later the team drew 1–1 in a game against the 1912 Swedish Olympic team, and the newspapers in Stockholm nominated IFK Göteborg as &quot;the best Swedish football club ever&quot;. IFK Göteborg won Svenska Serien, the highest Swedish league at the time, but not the Swedish Championship deciding competition, for the fifth time in a row in 1917. The early IFK Göteborg team had no trainer; the club gained its first such official in 1921, when Hungarian manager Sándor Bródy was hired. Bródy was appointed manager for IFK two years later. The first Swedish official national league, Allsvenskan, started in late 1924, the year the legendary Filip Johansson made his debut for IFK Göteborg. The club finished second, but Johansson scored 39 goals in 22 games and was the league&#x27;s top goalscorer.
IFK won their first Allsvenskan title in 1934–35, the ten previous seasons of the league saw the club finish in the top four. Swedish football was dominated by teams from Gothenburg during these years, but IFK Göteborg were surprisingly relegated in 1937–38, although the team was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season. Back in the highest division, IFK finished second, with the league continuing despite the outbreak of World War II. IFK won another title in 1941–42 with a strong team, but the rest of the decade saw mixed results. The 1940s team included the talented Gunnar Gren, who became the top scorer in 1946–47. He was also awarded Guldbollen as the best player in Sweden, and won an Olympic gold medal with the Swedish team at the 1948 Olympics. When Gren left in 1949, IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan the following season. As happened the last time IFK played in a lower league, they were promoted directly back to Allsvenskan after one season in Division 2. IFK went on to compete in a European Cup, the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup, for the first time in 1958, but were eliminated in the second round by SC Wismut. In 1959, the all-time Allsvenskan record attendance of 52,194 was set when IFK played Örgryte IS at Nya Ullevi.

After an unglamorous decade, IFK were led by manager and retired footballer Bertil Johansson to a surprising championship title in 1969. The following season was one of the darkest in their history. IFK were relegated, and unlike previous relegations they did not make an immediate return. After three seasons in the second league IFK had lost all signs of being a team from Allsvenskan, and had still not managed to gain promotion. But after hard work from board member Anders Bernmar and others to get the club on the right track, IFK were promoted to Allsvenskan in 1976. In 1979, IFK hired Sven-Göran Eriksson as manager. He introduced the 4–4–2 system with &quot;pressure and support&quot;, called the Swenglish model, which would give IFK great success later on, and his first season at the club ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the club&#x27;s first gold medal in Svenska Cupen.
After reinforcing the team with several expensive players, including Thomas Wernerson and Stig Fredriksson, IFK had finished second in the league and reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup as 1981 came to an end. 1982 then became a turbulent season as the whole board was replaced and the club almost went bankrupt, even needing to borrow money from the official supporter&#x27;s association to travel to Valencia to play the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup. After the troubled start IFK won every competition they entered, including Allsvenskan, the Allsvenskan play-off, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, defeating Hamburger SV 4–0 on aggregate in the finals. During the following 15 years the club was the leading club in Swedish football, winning the Swedish championship ten times, the domestic cup three times and the UEFA Cup twice.

IFK managed to field a strong team for a couple of years and won gold in the league in both 1983 and 1984, and the cup in 1983. In 1986, the team reached the semi-finals of the European Cup but were defeated on penalties against FC Barcelona. A new team of talents won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987, after beating Dundee United in the UEFA Cup final. The youth manager Roger Gustafsson took over the team from Gunder Bengtsson in 1990, and his time with IFK was to become very successful, winning Allsvenskan five times between 1990 and 1995.

As IFK won the 1993 Allsvenskan, they qualified for European competition. IFK advanced to the group stage of the Champions League, where they faced FC Barcelona, Manchester United and Galatasaray. Elimination at the group stage was widely anticipated, but IFK Göteborg confounded expectations by winning the group and advancing to the knockout stage. However, IFK Göteborg was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals.

The last years before the new millennium were disappointing for IFK, providing a stark contrast to the earlier success. The team only managed a silver in 1997 and an eighth place in 1998, after buying several expensive players who failed to produce. In both 1998 and 1999 IFK changed managers mid-season, something which had previously never happened in the club&#x27;s history. The last year of the decade ended with a sixth-place finish. The new millennium offered varied results, with the club playing a relegation play-off in 2002, but challenging for the championship in 2001, 2004, and 2005. In 2007, the first title in eleven years was secured in the last round of Allsvenskan. The club then won the national cup Svenska Cupen the next season. IFK Göteborg are still considered to be one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; in Swedish football, along with Malmö FF and AIK, despite only having won the Allsvenskan title once during the last 20 years.


==Colours, crest and sponsorship==
===Colours and kit===
The traditional colours of all IFK associations are blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club&#x27;s foundation in 1904, it was decided that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club&#x27;s first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.




===Crest===

The crest of IFK Göteborg has its origins in the coat of arms of the city of Gothenburg which in turn is based on several other heraldic arms. The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the House of Bjälbo, and the lion holds the Three Crowns of Sweden, both symbols being used in the coat of arms of Sweden. This arms was granted to Gothenburg by Gustavus Adolphus. The coat of arms of the city sees the lion facing the sinister (heraldic left, which is viewer&#x27;s right) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion, the normal being a lion facing the dexter (heraldic right) side, and IFK chose to use the latter on the club crest. Finally the three letters IFK were added on top. This crest has been used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919. These main elements have not been modified since then, but during the years several different designs of the crest have been used, occasionally having the lion facing the sinister side. In the early 1980s, the club standardised the design and only minor changes, such as element colours and different hues, have been made since then, with the exception of the years 1997–1999 when IFK, with Reebok as kit sponsors, used a crest with some more distinct changes to the standard elements. Details of the crest were slightly updated in 2020 to increase visibility and clarity, and the blue colour was modified. The new blue colour is the result of analysing different blue hues used in home kits from the last 40 years, and selecting the mean colour value. Before 1919 various other symbols were used, with the four-pointed star of the IFK associations featuring on the shirts until 1910.

===Sponsorship===
Kappa is the club&#x27;s kit manufacturer since 2016, replacing Adidas, who had supplied the kit for a majority of the seasons since the 1970s.

Apart from the Kappa brand, IFK Göteborg has the logos of the following companies visible on their shirt and shorts: Serneke, a construction company; Elkontakt, an electrical contractor; Morris Law, a law firm; Atea, an IT-infrastructure company; Länsförsäkringar, an insurance company and bank; Rasta, a chain of road restaurants and motels; German automakers Volkswagen; and league sponsors Svenska Spel, a government-owned gambling company.

Serneke replaced Prioritet Finans as the main shirt sponsor before the 2019 season, becoming the third main sponsor in the club&#x27;s history. The grocery-store chain ICA had sponsored IFK Göteborg since 1974, and their logo was displayed on the chest of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some to consider it an integral part of the shirt. The ICA logo was reproduced in its original red colour for the first few years, but was then changed to a blue-and-white version to better blend with the kit colours.

==Facilities and stadiums==
===Facilities===
IFK Göteborg played its first match, a training match between the first and second team of the club, at Karlsrofältet. A memorial stone with the caption &quot;Here at Karlsrofältet, IFK Göteborg played their first ever football match in the year 1904&quot; () has been raised by the field to commemorate the event. Karlsrofältet was mainly used as a training pitch in the early years of the club, until IFK stopped using the field completely in 1910.
Between 1946 and 1964, IFK&#x27;s clubhouse was Lilla Sjödala, located in Pixbo, Mölnlycke, just outside Gothenburg. The house was mostly used by the club&#x27;s orienteering and athletics departments. On 1 October 1961, a new complex, Kamratgården, was officially opened near Delsjön. A number of additions were made over the years, and by 2004 the floor area of Kamratgården had grown to , a nearby indoor hall and two full-size grass pitches. The buildings were demolished in February 2011, and a new modern facility was opened on 18 March 2012, housing an administrative and sports area on two floors and .

The football academy of IFK Göteborg as well as Änglagårdsskolan, an elementary school affiliated with IFK, are housed at Prioritet Serneke Arena, a multi-sport complex in the district of Kviberg. The indoor full-size football pitch at Prioritet Serneke Arena is also, on occasion, used for first-team friendly matches.

===Stadiums===
Historically, IFK Göteborg&#x27;s main home stadium has been Gamla Ullevi, where the majority of the competitive games have been played. The club has played there in two separate periods, most recently after leaving Ullevi (Nya Ullevi) in 1992, although matches attracting large crowds, such as derbies against the rivals Örgryte IS and GAIS, or international games, were still played at the larger Ullevi stadium. Gamla Ullevi&#x27;s capacity was 18,000 when used in the 1990s and 2000s, while Nya Ullevi has a capacity of 43,200.

Gamla Ullevi was demolished on 9 January 2007 to make place for a new stadium with the same name, Gamla Ullevi, with a capacity of 18,800. The new stadium was completed in late 2008, but not opened until the start of the 2009 season. During construction, IFK Göteborg played the 2007 and 2008 seasons at Nya Ullevi. On 11 April 2009 IFK Göteborg played their first game on the new Gamla Ullevi stadium and won against Djurgården with 6–0 in front of 18,276 spectators.
IFK Göteborg have used three other stadia as official home grounds. The first ground was Idrottsplatsen, in use from 1905 to 1915. It was built in 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for track cycling. During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte&#x27;s then home ground, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen. The third official stadium was Walhalla Idrottsplats, used for a number of home matches at the same time as Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, Slottsskogsvallen, has never been the official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.

Idrottsplatsen fell into decline due to poor leadership and a troubled economy in the 1910s, and a decision was made to completely renovate the arena with the help of outside sponsorship and funding. The construction of the new football ground was started in 1915 and used the site of Idrottsplatsen as foundation. The new stadium, originally named Ullervi, but later changed to Ullevi and finally Gamla Ullevi, was opened in 1916. It was the home ground of IFK Göteborg until 1958, when Nya Ullevi, built for the 1958 World Cup held in Sweden, was opened. Due to a number of seasons with low attendance in Swedish football in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a move back to Gamla Ullevi was made in 1992.

==Supporters and club relationships==
===Supporters===

Before the foundation of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular among the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.

After World War I, the rivalry calmed, and Gothenburg supporters became known as friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called &quot;Göteborgstågen&quot;, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.
As in most other parts of the world, the decades following the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth to some of the most well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK&#x27;s Black Army, Djurgårdens IF&#x27;s Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg&#x27;s supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.

As the club gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and thousands of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and the first few years of the new millennium brought the club&#x27;s highest average attendance since the early 1980s.

In the 2000s, supporter culture in Sweden started to shift from being English-influenced to being more influenced by the Southern European countries and their football culture, making tifos and ultras a common sight in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, (Änglarna), IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK is the most popular football club in Sweden; a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish football fans, and surveys in 2016 and 2017 again confirmed that IFK was the most popular club in Sweden, with a support of 10%. A majority, 51%, of football fans in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in Stockholm (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and Hammarby IF) and the second most popular in Malmö, after Malmö FF.

Since 2009, the club&#x27;s entrance music is &quot;Snart skiner Poseidon&quot; (&quot;Soon Poseidon will shine&quot;), referring to one of Gothenburg&#x27;s landmarks, Poseidon med brunnskar, a bronze statue created by Carl Milles. The song was written by singer-songwriter Joel Alme.

===Club relationships===

IFK Göteborg is part of Göteborgsalliansen, an alliance including two other major teams from Gothenburg: GAIS and Örgryte IS. Besides arranging tournaments, they together hosted big games in which the best players from each club represented the side. In 2015, IFK announced a partnership with Utsiktens BK, an agreement involving IFK&#x27;s players to be loaned out to the club for first team experience. The supporter group &quot;Ultras Göteborg&quot; have a supporter friendship with Ultras Nürnberg, fans of the German football club 1. FC Nürnberg.

<text>USS &quot;Haddock&quot; (SSN-621), was the last to be built. She was also the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after the haddock, a large species of fish.

The contract to build her was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 24 August 1960 and her keel was laid down on 24 April 1961. She was launched on 21 May 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Corinne (Steven) Morris, wife of Representative Thomas G. Morris of New Mexico who had served on USS Sealion (SS-195) before WWII, and commissioned on 22 December 1967 with Commander Stanley J. Anderson in command.

==Service history==
Commissioned in December 1967, &quot;Haddock&quot; underwent sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico. She transited the Panama Canal between January and February of 1968, arriving and being drydocked at Puget Sound Naval Yard in the spring of 1968. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 3 in late 1968 and arrived at her first homeport, San Diego, in 1969. Following a deployment to the Western Pacific, her home port was transferred to Pearl Harbor in time for her first overhaul, which was completed in 1972. &quot;Haddock&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for significant achievements during her next deployment.

Haddock underwent a resupply and refit in 1973 in her new homeport in Hawaii.

In 1977, &quot;Haddock&quot; had a 19-month overhaul in Mare Island, following which she was restationed in San Diego, and reassigned to Submarine Squadron Three.

In early 1981, &quot;Haddock&quot; participated in Ready Ex-81. &quot;Haddock&quot; completed her seventh deployment to the Western Pacific on 23 December 1983. She then went to Mare Island in October 1984 for her third overhaul and returned to San Diego and Submarine Squadron Three in February 1987. &quot;Haddock&quot; earned the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; Award for fiscal year 1988.

&quot;Haddock&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific for the eleventh time from July to October 1991.

:&quot;History needed for 1991–1993.&quot;
==Fate==

&quot;Haddock&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 April 1993. Ex-&quot;Haddock&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 1 October 2000. Recycling was completed on 1 October 2001.

<text>USS &quot;Guardfish&quot; (SSN-612), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the guardfish, a voracious green and silvery fish with elongated pike-like body and long narrow jaws.

== Construction and career==
The contract to build &quot;Guardfish&quot; was awarded to New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey on 9 June 1960 and her keel was laid down on 28 February 1961. She was launched on 15 May 1965, sponsored by Mrs. Kenneth E. BeLieu, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. &quot;Guardfish&quot; commissioned on 20 December 1966.

The submarine departed Camden on 15 February 1967, and commenced shakedown training, conducting exercises in the San Juan, Puerto Rico area. Upon completion of these exercises, &quot;Guardfish&quot; transited the Panama Canal and joined the United States Pacific Fleet as a unit of Submarine Squadron Seven, homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She participated in several submarine operations in the Pacific, steaming over in her first year at sea.

On 13 January 1968, Commander H. A. Benton, USN, assumed command. After conducting a variety of submarine missions and exercises including her first six-month Western Pacific deployment. In 1970 &quot;Guardfish&quot; returned to Atlantic waters to commence an overhaul at Ingalls Nuclear Shipbuilding Division, Pascagoula, Mississippi. On 4 November 1970, Commander D.C. Minton III, USN, assumed command. After overhaul, the ship returned to the Pacific as a unit of Submarine Squadron Seven. &quot;Guardfish&quot; participated in various submarine operations in the Pacific, for which she received the Navy Unit Commendation.

===Echo II===
During the summer of 1972 &quot;Guardfish&quot; was deployed in the Sea of Japan. On 9 May the Vietnam War was heating up as the Paris peace talks had broken down and American forces had commenced mining Haiphong and other major North Vietnamese harbors. The aim was to deny the North Vietnamese Army the advantage of being supplied by sea from their communist allies. &quot;Guardfish&quot; was alerted by message of the possibility of a Soviet naval response.

&quot;Guardfish&quot; was positioned at periscope depth near the Soviet&#x27;s largest Pacific naval base. Late on the evening of 10 May a surface contact was detected standing out the channel at high speed cutting across the normal channel boundaries and heading almost directly for the waiting &quot;Guardfish&quot;. As the contact closed in the growing darkness it was visually identify as a Soviet missile submarine. This class displaced 5,000 tons, was powered by a nuclear reactor, and carried eight Shaddock surface-to-surface missiles, which could be fired at targets up to away. &quot;Guardfish&quot; followed. Soon the Echo submerged and headed southeast at high speed.

During the next two days the Soviet submarine frequently slowed and spent long periods at periscope depth, probably receiving detailed orders from his naval commander. While listening for the Echo, &quot;Guardfish&quot; slowed which significantly extended her sonar detection range. To the crew&#x27;s surprise and alarm they were able to detect at least two and possibly three other Soviet submarines in the area.

When the Echo II resumed its transit toward the southern exit of the Sea of Japan the commander of &quot;Guardfish&quot; broke radio silence and notified his operational commander of the situation. The Echo turned to clear this baffle area almost hourly. Frequent status reports were needed in Washington D.C. to assess the threat and intent of the Soviet forces. President Nixon and his National Security Advisor were briefed daily. Because high powered high frequency radio transmissions from &quot;Guardfish&quot; were subject to detection and location by the Soviet electronic intercept network, an alternate method of communicating was established. Navy Anti-Submarine Warfare P-3 Orion aircraft flew covert missions over &quot;Guardfish&quot;″s projected location and received status reports via short range ultra high frequency radio either directly from &quot;Guardfish&quot; at periscope depth or via SLOT buoys, small expendable battery powered transmitters that could be programmed with a short message and shot out of the signal ejector while &quot;Guardfish&quot; remained at trail depth.

During this period of the trail every available submarine in the Pacific was urgently being deployed to provide protection for US aircraft carriers operating off the Vietnamese coast and to search for the other Soviet submarines. This deployment created a mutual interference problem for both &quot;Guardfish&quot; and the submarine operations staff. Once in the Philippine Sea the Echo turned southwest heading in the general direction of the Bashi Channel, the strait between Taiwan and the islands north of Luzon, Philippines. The Bashi is the usual northern entrance to the South China Sea and the skipper was sure that it was the Echo&#x27;s objective, but their track continued well south of the normal course. Then the Echo slowed and came to periscope depth and went active on his fathometer on a short scale which was not suitable for the depth of water. The Echo then went deep, turned toward the Bashi Channel, and increased speed to . After reporting this rapid course correction by slot buoy &quot;Guardfish&quot; rushed after the Soviet submarine knowing that the repositioning of US submarines would be nearly impossible on this short notice. As a precaution against collision with a US submarine the skipper changed depth to , a depth commonly used by Soviet submarines and one he knew US submarines would avoid. This choice was justified when &quot;Guardfish&quot; detected a US submarine clearing to the north at high speed.

On 18 May the Echo entered the South China Sea and transited to a point approximately off the coast of Luzon. For eight days he established a slow moving grid track which covered a rectangular patrol area approximately from U.S. carriers along the Vietnamese coast and well beyond the 200-mile range of its missiles.

While the tracking team struggled to maintain contact with the Echo, President Nixon went to Moscow for a summit meeting with Soviet&#x27;s general secretary Brezhnev. During the summit National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger informed Brezhnev that the US knew the Soviets had deployed submarines and their presence so close to the Vietnamese War Zone was provocative and extremely dangerous. Within two days of this confrontation, the Soviets recalled their submarines and the Echo started north.

After transiting the Bashi Channel the Echo established a second patrol area in the Philippine Sea south of Okinawa. This area of the ocean had some of the worst possible acoustical properties. It was often crossed by merchant traffic and at night the biological noise and frequent rain showers were deafening to sonar. Contact was hard to maintain and forced &quot;Guardfish&quot; to trail at closer and closer ranges. A lengthy procedure to transfer the trail to another US submarine, just developed by the staff, was placed on the radio broadcast. While &quot;Guardfish&quot; was at periscope depth copying this urgent message, the Echo came unexpectedly to periscope depth and visually detected &quot;Guardfish&quot;. The maneuvers that followed by both &quot;Guardfish&quot; and the Echo were violent and at high speed. Holding on to an alerted contact proved to be impossible and contact with the Echo was lost. &quot;Guardfish&quot; returned to Guam on 10 June. The crew had been underway submerged for 123 days with only an eight-day refit as a break.

On 15 December 1972, Commander B.G. Balderston, USN, assumed command. On 31 March 1973, Commander W.S. Rich, USN, assumed command. On 14 August 1974, &quot;Guardfish&quot; completed her 612th successful dive. &quot;Guardfish&quot; also underwent regular overhaul at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and went on WestPac. &quot;Guardfish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in June 1975, to change homeports to Vallejo, California.

=== 1973 Reactor Accident ===
About 370 miles from Puget Sound sailing between Pearl Harbor and Bangor, Washington, the Guardfish suffered a leak in the primary coolant of its nuclear reactor. A crewman performing a leak test on a valve accidentally created a path for coolant to flow out from the primary loop, which circulates through the reactor core. The submarine surfaced to ventilate and decontaminate. Five crewman were sprayed with radioactive steam and required decontamination, followed by hospital care at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The Navy did not publicly disclose the accident at the time and classified all records of the event.

=== Mid to late 1970s ===
On 9 July 1975, Lieutenant Commander G.H. Kannady Jr., USN, assumed command. &quot;Guardfish&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard in August 1975 for refueling, and returned to sea in July 1977, Changing homeport to San Diego, California, as an operational unit of Submarine Squadron Three. &quot;Guardfish&quot; went through a refueling / SUBSAFE overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, completing her first dive to full test depth in 1977. In January 1979, &quot;Guardfish&quot; completed a successful six-month deployment to WESTPAC and conducted special operations with one of the first digital sonar systems to deploy in the Pacific being awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

On 9 February 1979, Commander R. E. Vaughan, USN, assumed command. &quot;Guardfish&quot; departed on a six-month Western Pacific Deployment in 1980 and was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations during its deployment. From 16 to 21 May 1980 &quot;Guardfish&quot; visited the Australian Naval base HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia, the only visit she would make to the base during her service.

=== 1980s ===
On 2 July 1982, Commander D. A. Oltraver, USN, assumed command. The ship won the ASW &quot;E&quot; and Communications &quot;C&quot; in both 1982 and 1983, and was awarded the Silver Anchor Award in the spring of 1984 for her outstanding retention program. &quot;Guardfish&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul in September 1983 and completed the overhaul in August 1985.

On 24 August 1985, Commander T. W. Hack, USN, assumed command. GUARDFISH returned from a most successful six month Western Pacific Deployment in January 1987, for which she was awarded her third Navy Unit Commendation. &quot;Guardfish&quot; was also awarded the Silver Anchor Award for 1985 and 1986, and won the Submarine Squadron Three Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;, ASW &quot;A&quot;, Supply &quot;E&quot; and the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for most improved ship in battle efficiency in the Pacific Fleet for Fiscal Year 1987.

On 7 November 1987, Commander J. B. Bryant, USN, assumed command. &quot;Guardfish&quot; conducted two Western Pacific deployments and a three-month Selective Restrictive Availability between September 1988 and October 1990. The ship earned the Deck Seamanship Award for three consecutive years, 1988 through 1990, and was awarded the Silver Anchor and Battle &quot;E&quot; Awards in Fiscal Year 1989.

=== 1990s and fate ===
On 17 November 1990, Commander P. M. Higgins, USN, assumed command. &quot;Guardfish&quot; conducted a Northern Pacific Deployment before changing homeport in June 1991 to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. The ship entered an inactivation availability in July 1991, and was decommissioned on 4 February 1992. &quot;Guardfish&quot; earned the Silver Dolphin flag in 1991 for Enlisted Warfare Qualification excellence.

&quot;Guardfish&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 4 February 1992. Her hulk entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program. Recycling was completed on 9 July 1992.

<doc id="475385" wikidata="Q5244271" url="?curid=475385" title="De Boor's algorithm">
<text>In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis, de Boor&#x27;s algorithm is a polynomial-time and numerically stable algorithm for evaluating spline curves in B-spline form. It is a generalization of de Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm for Bézier curves. The algorithm was devised by German-American mathematician Carl R. de Boor. Simplified, potentially faster variants of the de Boor algorithm have been created but they suffer from comparatively lower stability.

== Introduction ==

A general introduction to B-splines is given in the main article. Here we discuss de Boor&#x27;s algorithm, an efficient and numerically stable scheme to evaluate a spline curve formula_1 at position formula_2. The curve is built from a sum of B-spline functions formula_3 multiplied with potentially vector-valued constants formula_4, called control points,
formula_5
B-splines of order formula_6 are connected piece-wise polynomial functions of degree formula_7 defined over a grid of knots formula_8 (we always use zero-based indices in the following). De Boor&#x27;s algorithm uses O(p2) + O(p) operations to evaluate the spline curve. Note: the main article about B-splines and the classic publications use a different notation: the B-spline is indexed as formula_9 with formula_10.

== Local support ==

B-splines have local support, meaning that the polynomials are positive only in a finite domain and zero elsewhere. The Cox-de Boor recursion formula shows this:
formula_11
formula_12

Let the index formula_13 define the knot interval that contains the position, formula_14. We can see in the recursion formula that only B-splines with formula_15 are non-zero for this knot interval. Thus, the sum is reduced to:
formula_16

It follows from formula_17 that formula_18. Similarly, we see in the recursion that the highest queried knot location is at index formula_19. This means that any knot interval formula_20 which is actually used must have at least formula_7 additional knots before and after. In a computer program, this is typically achieved by repeating the first and last used knot location formula_7 times. For example, for formula_23 and real knot locations formula_24, one would pad the knot vector to formula_25.

== The algorithm ==

With these definitions, we can now describe de Boor&#x27;s algorithm. The algorithm does not compute the B-spline functions formula_3 directly. Instead it evaluates formula_1 through an equivalent recursion formula.

Let formula_28 be new control points with formula_29 for formula_30. For formula_31 the following recursion is applied:
formula_32
formula_33

Once the iterations are complete, we have formula_34, meaning that formula_35 is the desired result.

De Boor&#x27;s algorithm is more efficient than an explicit calculation of B-splines formula_3 with the Cox-de Boor recursion formula, because it does not compute terms which are guaranteed to be multiplied by zero.

== Optimizations ==

The algorithm above is not optimized for the implementation in a computer. It requires memory for formula_37 temporary control points formula_28. Each temporary control point is written exactly once and read twice. By reversing the iteration over formula_39 (counting down instead of up), we can run the algorithm with memory for only formula_6 temporary control points, by letting formula_28 reuse the memory for formula_42. Similarly, there is only one value of formula_43 used in each step, so we can reuse the memory as well.

Furthermore, it is more convenient to use a zero-based index formula_44 for the temporary control points. The relation to the previous index is formula_45. Thus we obtain the improved algorithm:

Let formula_46 for formula_47. Iterate for formula_31:
formula_49
formula_50
Note that must be counted down. After the iterations are complete, the result is formula_51.

== Example implementation ==

The following code in the Python programming language is a naive implementation of the optimized algorithm.
def deBoor(k: int, x: int, t, c, p: int):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Evaluates S(x).

 Arguments
 k: Index of knot interval that contains x.
 x: Position.
 t: Array of knot positions, needs to be padded as described above.
 c: Array of control points.
 p: Degree of B-spline.
 d = [c[j + k - p] for j in range(0, p + 1)] 

 for r in range(1, p + 1):
 for j in range(p, r - 1, -1):
 alpha = (x - t[j + k - p]) / (t[j + 1 + k - r] - t[j + k - p])

<text>Colorado State University (Colorado State or CSU) is a public land-grant research university in Fort Collins, Colorado, United States. It is the flagship university of the Colorado State University System. It was founded in 1870 as Colorado Agricultural College and assumed its current name in 1957. In 2024, enrollment was approximately 34,000 students, including resident and non-resident instruction students. The university has approximately 1,500 faculty in 8 colleges and 55 academic departments. 

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees are offered in 65 fields of study and master&#x27;s degrees are offered in 55 fields. Colorado State confers doctoral degrees in 40 fields of study, in addition to a professional degree in veterinary medicine. In fiscal year 2023, CSU spent $498.1 million on research and development. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

CSU&#x27;s campus includes the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory (EECL), the University Center for the Arts, which houses the Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising and the Gregory Allicar Museum of Art, the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA).

The Colorado State Rams compete in the NCAA Division I Mountain West Conference. Swimmer and six-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken is one of CSU&#x27;s most notable athletes. Other CSU alumni are Nobel Prize winners, Pulitzer Prize winners, astronauts, CEOs, Marshall Scholars and two former governors of Colorado. CSU faculty includes Fulbright Program American Scholars, members of National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Guggenheim fellowship.

==History==

===Early years===
CSU was known at its founding as the Colorado Agricultural College. Arising from the Morrill Act of 1862, the act to create the university was signed by the Colorado Territory governor Edward M. McCook in 1870. While a board of 12 trustees was formed to &quot;purchase and manage property, erect buildings, establish basic rules for governing the institutions and employ buildings,&quot; the near complete lack of funding by the territorial legislature for this mission severely hampered progress.

The first parcel of land for the campus was deeded in 1871 by Robert Dazell. In 1872, the Larimer County Land Improvement Company contributed a second parcel. The first $1000 to erect buildings was finally allocated by the territorial legislature in 1874. The funds were not, however, and trustees were required to find a matching amount, which they eventually obtained from local citizens and businesses.
Among the institutions which donated matching funds was the local Grange, which was heavily involved in the early establishment of the university. As part of this effort, in the spring of 1874, Grange No. 6 held a picnic and planting event at the corner of College Avenue and West Laurel Street, and later plowed and seeded 20 acres (80,000 m2) of wheat on a nearby field. Within several months, the university&#x27;s first building, a -by-24-foot red brick building nicknamed the &quot;Claim Shanty&quot; was finished, providing the first tangible presence of the institution in Fort Collins.

After Colorado achieved statehood in 1876, the territorial law establishing the college was required to be reauthorized. In 1877, the state legislature created the eight-member State Board of Agriculture to govern the school. Early in the 21st century, the governing board was renamed the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System. The legislature also authorized a railroad right-of-way across the campus and a mill levy to raise money for construction of the campus&#x27; first main building, Old Main, which was completed in December 1878. Despite wall cracks and other structural problems suffered during its first year, the building was opened in time for the welcoming of the first five students on September 1, 1879, by university president Elijah Evan Edwards. Enrollment grew to 25 by 1880.

During the first term at Colorado Agricultural College in fall 1879, the school functioned more as a college-prep school than a college because of the lack of trained students. Consequently, the first course offerings were arithmetic, English, U.S. history, natural philosophy, horticulture and farm economy. Students also labored on the college farm and attended daily chapel services. The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction. Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member, and with students. The board&#x27;s next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan State Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with just two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.
====President Charles Ingersoll====
Agricultural research grew rapidly under Ingersoll. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided federal funds to establish and maintain experiment stations at land-grant colleges. Ainsworth Blount, CAC&#x27;s first professor of practical agriculture and manager of the College Farm, had become known as a &quot;one man experiment station&quot;, and the Hatch Act expanded his original station to five Colorado locations. The curriculum expanded as well, introducing coursework in engineering, animal science, and liberal arts. New faculty members brought expertise in botany, horticulture, entomology, and irrigation engineering. CAC made its first attempts at animal science during 1883–84, when it hired veterinary surgeon George Faville. Faville conducted free weekly clinics for student instruction and treatment of local citizen&#x27;s diseased or injured animals. Veterinary science at the college languished for many years following Faville&#x27;s departure in 1886.

President Ingersoll believed the school neglected special programs for women. Despite the reluctance of the institution&#x27;s governing board, CAC began opening the door to liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll&#x27;s last year at CAC the college had instituted a &quot;Ladies Course&quot; that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, stenography and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology. Ingersoll&#x27;s belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation. In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.

====Professor Louis G. Carpenter====
One of the early notable professors was Louis George Carpenter (March 28, 1861 – September 12, 1935), who was happy to be called &quot;Professor Carp.&quot; He was a college professor and later the Dean of Engineering &amp; Physics at Colorado State University formerly known as the Colorado Agricultural College. He was also an engineer, mathematician, and irrigation and consulting engineer.

Carpenter began teaching mathematics at Michigan State Agricultural College, and did so from 1883 to 1888.

Carpenter was recruited by President Charles Ingersoll and accepted the chair of the Engineering &amp; Physics Department of the then Colorado Agricultural College. There, he began the first organized and systematic college program for irrigation engineering. Those completing such instruction were awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Irrigation Engineering. Carpenter was a strong advocate for expanding education opportunities to minorities and women. He helped promote and organize newly accredited degree programs despite opposition from those unwilling to change.

Carpenter declined the Presidency of that college (later university) in 1891 and several times during his tenure. Despite difficulty to enact change, he was significant in being able to help transform the farm focused college into a university of higher learning.

In 1889, he became the director of the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station.

Carpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. He investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law. He became Colorado&#x27;s State Engineer, a post he held for several years while still teaching.

In 1911, Carpenter left academics and established an engineering consulting firm in Denver. This covered not only included irrigation engineering, but also consulting on hydraulic construction projects and the problems associated with such projects. He did this traveling around Canada, the United States and Western Europe with his brother running the office until his retirement in 1922. He left many papers to the university and was given an honorary doctorate before his death in 1935.

===Turn of the 20th century===
Alston Ellis encountered limited funding and decided in 1895 to reduce the number of Experiment Stations. Female students grew in number from 44 in 1892 to 112 in 1896, and by fall 1895, the college&#x27;s new domestic-economy program was in place. Football had a one-year stint at CAC in 1893, but Ellis was not a supporter of extracurricular activities and was especially hostile towards football.

Barton Aylesworth became the school&#x27;s fourth president in 1899, and the combination of his non-confrontational style with the presence of the vocal Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association on the governing board allowed ranching and farming interests to take the college&#x27;s agricultural programs to new heights, greatly influencing the development of the entire school. Initially, the influence of ranching interests brought tremendous progress to CAC&#x27;s agricultural programs. Enrollment quadrupled, studies in veterinary medicine were re-established, and CAC&#x27;s Experiment Station benefited from lobbying that finally secured state appropriations. Eventually, conflicts with agricultural interests may have prompted Aylesworth to begin promoting a more balanced curriculum at CAC, which he then fought hard to defend. The conflict also led him to tire and negotiate his resignation.

Aylesworth was a big supporter of extracurricular activities. Football returned to the college in fall 1899, but baseball was the school&#x27;s most popular sport. In 1903, the women&#x27;s basketball team won CAC&#x27;s first unofficial athletic championship, culminating with a victory over the University of Colorado. New clubs, fraternities, and sororities also emerged. By 1905, the school had a fledgling music department, which two years later became the Conservatory of Music.

==== President Charles Lory ====
Taking office in 1909, CAC President Charles Lory oversaw the school&#x27;s maturation and reconciled longstanding conflicts between supporters of a broad or specialized curriculum. He embarked on a demanding schedule of personal appearances to make Colorado Agricultural College known as an institution that served the state&#x27;s needs. Another of Lory&#x27;s notable achievements was putting the school on solid fiscal ground, meeting rising construction costs and freeing the institution of debt.

The onset of World War I influenced all aspects of CAC, but nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the institution&#x27;s programs for farmers. World War I created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado. World War I also drew men from campus to Europe&#x27;s battlefields. In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the Reserve Officers Training Corps. A few months later CAC applied to establish an ROTC unit in Fort Collins and resurrected a defunct National Guard unit on campus.

During the early 1930s, CAC&#x27;s community-wide activities were greatly influenced by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought. President Lory sought to help Colorado farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens and played a significant role in a 1930s project that supplied irrigation water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.

Lory and the State Board had challenges of their own back on campus. In response to claims that the university was falling behind national standards, the board retired or demoted several senior professors and administrators deemed past the peak of their proficiency and hired new doctorate-holding personnel while consolidating sections of lecture courses. A student petition led to the governing-board to change the college&#x27;s name to more accurately reflect the diversity of its academic programs, and in 1935 the school became the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or Colorado A&amp;M for short. After 31 years of leadership, President Lory announced his retirement in 1938.

===From World War II into the modern era===
Soon after Pearl Harbor, Colorado A&amp;M began to look like a military post, with the college serving as many as 1,500 servicemen. New President Roy Green tried to prepare for the sudden departure of students and arrival of servicemen by improving ROTC facilities and introducing military-training programs. Although servicemen filed onto campus, student enrollment at Colorado A&amp;M, 1,637 in fall 1942, dropped to 701 by fall 1943, and female students outnumbered their male counterparts for the first time. When the war ceased in 1945, soldiers returning from Europe and the Pacific filled U.S. higher-education institutions. Nearly 1,040 students attended the college in fall 1946, and about 1,600 students enrolled by spring 1946. Close to 80 former &quot;Aggies&quot; died in World War II including football talent Lewis &quot;Dude&quot; Dent.

====Colorado A&amp;M becomes a university under Bill Morgan====
Colorado A&amp;M shed its image as a narrow technical college and became a university in appearance and title during the 1950s under President Bill Morgan. Providing adequate student housing for an increasing number of youth approaching college age and improving cramped instructional facilities were among the first tests of Morgan&#x27;s leadership. He responded, and five new residence halls were completed between 1953 and 1957.

Academic offerings grew to include advanced degrees. The State Board of Agriculture approved a doctoral degree in civil engineering in 1951, and three years later allowed other qualified departments to offer doctorates. Morgan believed students earning this advanced degree should hold it from a university, and so began a campaign to upgrade Colorado A&amp;M to university status. In 1957, the Colorado General Assembly approved the new name of Colorado State University.

====1960s: Student activism====
Colorado State became a scene of intense student activism during the 1960s and early 1970s. The reduction of strict campus regulations for women was among the early targets of student activists, coming to the forefront in 1964 when a 21-year-old female student moved into unapproved off-campus housing to accommodate her late hours as editor of the student newspaper.

The civil-rights movement on campus also picked up momentum and visibility. In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan&#x27;s retirement, Mexican American and African American student organizations presented a list of demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators&#x27; occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan&#x27;s home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.

Anti-military protest took place in dramatic form at Colorado State from 1968 to 1970. On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins&#x27; downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a placard tied to the memorial. Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers. In May 1970, as campus peace activists held the second day of a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the student deaths at Kent State University, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.

====2000s: CSU under President Penley====
In his welcoming address for the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to set the standard for the 21st century public land-grant research university. He identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries. A part of this approach was Colorado State&#x27;s Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the university has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace. Initial Superclusters in infectious disease and in cancer research were launched. As well, new residence halls were constructed according to national green building standards, and a sustainability advisory committee was charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.

While maintaining historic ties to local agriculture, administration officials also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community. As such, CSU became party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships. Another goal set by the university was to improve undergraduate education. Penley stated that essential tasks were access and graduation rates, particularly for qualified low-income and minority students, and an education international in scope suited to a global economy.

Penley resigned in 2008.

====Later 2000s: After President Penley====
While a statistics professor at CSU, Mary Meyer declared that a study of salaries by CSU created salary goals for women faculty that were &quot;substantially smaller than for men&quot;. This led CSU to start studying pay equity in 2015, which in turn led later that year to a quarter of female full professors receiving higher pay.

Joyce E. McConnell became the first female president of CSU in 2019. On June 9, 2022, the CSU Board of Governors and President McConnell announced she would be leaving her position as of June 30, 2022. Former Provost Rick Miranda was chosen to serve in an interim role while a new president is identified. In December 2022, the CSU Board announced the appointment of Amy Parsons, once its vice president of operations, then executive vice chancellor, as its 16th president effective Feb. 1, 2023.

==Campus==
Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado, a mid-size city of approximately 142,000 residents at the base of the Front Range of the southern Rocky Mountains. The university&#x27;s main campus is located in central Fort Collins and includes a veterinary teaching hospital. CSU is also home to a Foothills Campus, a agricultural campus, and the Pingree Park mountain campus. CSU uses for research centers and Colorado State Forest Service stations outside of Larimer County.

===Main campus===
At the heart of the CSU campus lies the Oval, an expansive green area around, lined with 65 American Elm trees. Designed in 1909, the Oval remains a center of activity and a major landmark at CSU. The Administration Building, constructed in 1924, faces the Oval from the south end, while several academic and administrative buildings occupy its perimeter. The Music Building, once the university library, currently houses the Institute for Learning and Teaching, which provides academic and career counseling as well as other student-focused programs. The music department moved to the University Center for the Arts upon its opening in 2008. At the northwest corner of the Oval is Ammons Hall, formerly the women&#x27;s recreational center and now home to the University Welcome Center. Just to the east of Ammons stands Guggenheim Hall, which currently houses the Department of Manufacturing Technology and Construction Management. The building was constructed in 1910 as a gift from U.S. Senator Simon Guggenheim to promote the study of home economics, and was recently renovated according to green building standards. Rounding out the Oval are the Weber Building, the Statistics Building, the Occupational Therapy Building, and Laurel Hall.

Another campus focal point is the main plaza, around which can be found Lory Student Center and Morgan Library, as well as several academic buildings. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU President Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU President William E. Morgan. Following the flood of &#x27;97, this facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998. Current holdings include more than 2 million books, bound journals, and government documents. Morgan Library also contains a addition called the Study Cube that seats 80 additional patrons. With a university issued ID card, students and staff are able to access the Cube 24 hours a day, including during finals week. To accommodate, the Loan and Reserve desk checks out laptops and other accessories overnight if checked out less than six hours prior to closing. 

 Colorado State University&#x27;s oldest existing building is Spruce Hall, constructed in 1881. Originally a dormitory that played a vital role in the early growth of the school&#x27;s student enrollment, Spruce now houses the Division of Continuing Education and the Office of Admissions. The newest academic building on campus is the Behavioral Science building, which was completed in summer 2010. Other recent projects include the 2006 Transit Center addition to the north end of Lory Student Center (certified LEED Gold), an expansion of the Student Recreation Center, and the new Computer Science Building, completed in 2008.

 In 2008, CSU also opened its University Center for the Arts, located in the old Fort Collins High School. CSU purchased this historic building in 1995 and has since converted it into a new home for its programs in music, dance, theatre and the visual arts. The three-phase building project included a 318-seat University Theatre, a 100-seat Studio Theatre, and the Runyan Music Hall, an adaptable rehearsal and performance space created out of the old high school gymnasium. The center also houses the University Art Museum, the Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising, a 285-seat organ recital hall, and the 200-seat University Dance Theatre.

The campus is served by Transfort bus service, including the MAX Bus Rapid Transit route that opened in 2014.

===Veterinary hospital===
The James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital was constructed in 1979 and houses 28 specialties under one roof, ranging from emergency to oncology. Located in the Veterinary Health Complex south of the main campus in Fort Collins, the hospital has 79 veterinarians on clinics, educating 280 third- and fourth-year veterinary students on clinical rotations. In fiscal 2019, the hospital logged nearly 47,000 cases.

===Foothills Campus===
The Foothills Campus, located on northwest edge of Fort Collins, is home to the department of atmospheric sciences, as well as several research and outreach centers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Engineering Research Center, B.W. Pickett Equine Center, Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA), the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and the Animal Reproduction Biotechnology Lab can all be found at the Foothills Campus.

==Organization==
===Administration===
Colorado State University is a public land-grant institution. Its 13-member board of governors presides over the Colorado State University System, including the flagship campus in Fort Collins together with Colorado State University–Pueblo and the CSU–Global Campus. The board consists of nine voting members appointed by the Governor of Colorado and confirmed by the Colorado State Senate and four elected non-voting members. Voting members are community leaders from many fields, including agriculture, business, and public service. The student body president as well as a faculty representative from each university act as non-voting board members. Amy Parsons currently serves as the 16th president of Colorado State University.

At its December 2008 public meeting, the Board of Governors of the CSU System decided it was in the best interest of all CSU System campuses to separate what had previously been a conjoined position of CSU System Chancellor and CSU Fort Collins President. On June 1, 2015, President Emeritus Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Frank, the 14th President of CSU, was named the finalist for the chancellor position.

==Academics==
Colorado State offers 150 programs of study across 8 colleges and 55 departments. In addition to its notable programs in biomedical sciences, engineering, environmental science, agriculture, and human health and nutrition, CSU offers professional programs in disciplines including business, journalism, and construction management as well as in the liberal and performing arts, humanities, and social sciences. CSU also offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, graduate degrees, certificates, and badges online.
Fall freshman statistics

The university employs a total of 1,540 faculty members, with 1,000 on tenure-track appointments. The student-faculty ratio is 17:1. CSU awarded 6,090 degrees in 2009–2010, including 4,336 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 1,420 master&#x27;s degrees, 203 doctoral degrees, and 131 Doctor in Veterinary Medicine degrees.

===Institutes and centers===
*Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA)
*Information Science &amp; Technology Center at Colorado State University (ISTeC)
*Energy Institute
*Public Lands History Center – In 2007, a group of CSU History and Anthropology faculty and research associates created the Center for Public History and Archaeology with the dual goal of providing practical and meaningful work experiences for graduate students and helpful collaborative projects for public agencies such as the National Park Service. In 2010, the name was changed to Public Lands History Center to better describe its focus and collaborative mission. The center&#x27;s mission is to &quot;foster the production of historical knowledge through collaborative engagement with institutions responsible for the sustainable stewardship of protected areas, water, and other critical resources.&quot; The center&#x27;s Director is one of its founders, CSU Professor of History and noted environmental historian Mark Fiege.

===Rankings===



&quot;Princeton Review&quot; named CSU&#x27;s MBA program as one of the 10 best administered programs nationwide in 2007 and 2012–2015. &quot;Business Week&quot; included CSU&#x27;s undergraduate business program among the best in the country in 2011, ranked at No. 89. In 2014, the College of Business moved up in the ranks to be ranked 73rd (an increase of 16 places from the previous year) in &quot;Bloomberg Business Week&quot;″s undergraduate rankings.

===Notable areas of research===
A 1961 feasibility study at CSU was crucial for the establishment of the Peace Corps.

Research in the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory has created a technological solution to limit pollutants from single-stroke engines, and is now in widespread use in the Philippines. The Center for Disaster and Risk Analysis is dedicated to reducing the harm and losses caused by natural, technological, and human-caused disasters. Projects have looked at Muslim-Americans after September 11, Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 BP oil spill, and childcare disaster planning.

Outlying campuses cater to a range of research activities including crops research, animal reproduction, public health and watershed management. The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) was established in 1888 in accordance with provisions of the Hatch Act of 1887, calling for experiment stations at land-grant universities. State and federal funds support CAES research programs. In 2007, research activities included pest management, food safety and nutrition, environmental quality, plant and animal production systems, and community and rural development. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultra Violet Science and Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, partners industry with Colorado State University, CU-Boulder, and the University of California-Berkeley. The Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2) is the first research center created under the umbrella of the new Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, involving CSU, CU, Colorado School of Mines, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The center develops biofuels and bio-refining technologies. Colorado State&#x27;s research Supercluster model brings together researchers across disciplines to work on topics of global concern in which CSU has a demonstrated expertise. Research results are connected to the marketplace through transfer, patenting and licensing activities carried out by experts with a focus on each research area.

CSU also has a well established research program in infectious disease. The Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, funded by the National Institutes of Health, is home to scientists developing vaccines and drugs for some world&#x27;s most devastating diseases. The Biocontainment Laboratory also houses one of 10 US Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases, funded by a $40 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Much of the Cancer Supercluster, which involves the collaboration of five colleges, is based around the work of the university&#x27;s Animal Cancer Center, the largest center of its kind in the world.

===International programs===
Approximately 950 students per year participate in educational programs abroad, and nearly 1,300 foreign students and scholars from more than 85 countries are engaged in academic work and research on campus. The initial pilot studies for the Peace Corps were conducted by Colorado State faculty, and the university is consistently one of the top-ranking institutions in the nation for the recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers. Since 1988, CSU and the Peace Corps have participated in four cooperative master&#x27;s degree programs in English, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Natural Resources, and Agriculture. The program involves at least 2 semesters of course work at CSU combined with time abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer. Colorado State offers various programs on campus for students interested in international issues. Regional specializations with core courses and electives are available in Asian Studies, Middle East/North Africa Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central Europe Studies. The Global Village Living Learning Community is a housing option for students with international interests.

===Honors Program===
The Honors Program provides challenging and enriching programs for high achieving students in all majors through two academic tracks. One track is designed for students aiming to complete their general education requirements within the Honors Program, and a second is composed of upper division courses, usually appropriate for currently enrolled or transfer students. The Academic Village, which opened in fall 2007, offers 180 Honor students the opportunity to live in the Honors Living Learning Community.

1,126 students participated in the Honors Program in fall 2007.

== Athletics ==

Colorado State University competes in 17 sponsored intercollegiate sports, including 11 for women (cross country, indoor track, outdoor track, volleyball, basketball, golf, tennis, swimming, softball, soccer and water polo) and six for men (football, cross country, indoor track, outdoor track, basketball, and golf). Colorado State&#x27;s athletic teams compete along with 8 other institutions in the Mountain West Conference (MW), which is an NCAA Division I conference and sponsors Division I FBS football. The Conference was formed in 1999, splitting from the former 16-member Western Athletic Conference. CSU has won 9 MW tournament championships and won or shared 11 regular season titles. Rams football teams won or shared the Mountain West title in 1999, 2000 and 2002.

On December 13, 2011, Jim McElwain was introduced as the head football coach at Colorado State. McElwain had worked as the Alabama offensive coordinator from 2008 to 2011. On December 4, 2014, Jim McElwain accepted the head coach position at the University of Florida. This was the first time a Colorado State Rams head coach left the team for another program.

On December 5, 2014, the Colorado State University System Board of Governors gave approval to build Canvas Stadium, an on-campus multi-use stadium to replace Hughes Stadium, built several miles from campus in the 1960s. 

=== Mascots ===

Over the years Colorado State University has displayed several mascots. An unknown black bear cub, often seen wearing sweaters, appeared at football games from 1909 to 1919. Purchased by a student in 1912, a bulldog named Peanuts would roam around campus. He served as a secondary mascot and was fed peanuts by the student body. On April 28, 1918, Peanuts was found poisoned. This was alleged to have been done by students of the University of Colorado Boulder, but has not been proven. After Peanuts&#x27; death, Glenn Morris, an alum of Colorado State University donated another bulldog named Gallant Defender to the university. The first ram to become the mascot of Colorado State University was Buck, introduced in 1946. Colorado State University&#x27;s mascot remains the ram to this day. During a basketball game halftime contest, CAM the Ram became the name of the beloved mascot.

==Student life==
Fort Collins is located north of Denver, an approximately two-hour drive from major ski resorts and a 45-minute drive from Rocky Mountain National Park. There are opportunities for students to be active, with bike trails and hiking nearby. In 2006, &quot;Money&quot; ranked Fort Collins as the &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; in the United States.

===Clubs and activities===
There are over 450 student organizations including 34 honor societies at CSU. 60% of undergraduates participate in intramural sports while 10% join one of 19 fraternities and 14 sororities. There are 30 sport clubs, including cycling, baseball, water polo, triathlon, wrestling, and rugby. 300 music, theatre and dance performances, exhibitions, and other arts events take place on campus each year. The student government is the Associated Students of Colorado State University. CSU&#x27;s daily newspaper is the Rocky Mountain Collegian. CSU also has a student-run campus television station and a student radio station, KCSU FM.

====Sport clubs====
Sport Clubs at Colorado State University were established in 1978. They are run and funded by student fees and team fundraisers and compete with other colleges and universities but not at the NCAA level. There are currently 30 Sport Club teams. Every year the clubs take a combined 150 trips. There are over 1,000 students associated with the program. Last year 23 of these teams competed at regional and national championships. The programs have enjoyed a significant amount of recent success with National Championships in: Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey (1995)
Women&#x27;s Lacrosse (2008, 2010, 2011, 2013); Baseball (2004–2010);
Men&#x27;s Lacrosse (1999, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2012).

The sports for which there are clubs at Colorado State University are alpine skiing, baseball, bowling, crew, cycling, field hockey, horse polo (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), ice hockey (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), in-line hockey, lacrosse (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), logging sports, rodeo (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), rugby (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), shotgun sports (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), snowboard, soccer (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), swimming, synchronized ice skating, triathlon (coed), ultimate frisbee summer league, ultimate frisbee (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), volleyball, water polo (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), and wrestling (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s).

====Student media====
The &quot;Rocky Mountain Collegian&quot; is CSU&#x27;s student-run daily newspaper. The paper has a fully functional website and a mobile application, and students have complete control over editorial decisions. The paper was founded in 1891, and was a weekly publication by the 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the paper earned disrepute in the local community for its unpopular support of women&#x27;s rights and anti-racism stance. By the 1970s, the &quot;Collegian&quot; was consistently publishing daily. Editorial quality and financial support have varied over the years, at times rising among elite college newspapers and at others struggling to publish. During the 1990s, the paper was twice selected as one of the top 12 daily student papers in the country. In late 2007, the &quot;Collegian&quot; published a staff article that incited national debate about free speech. The article read, in its entirety, &quot;Taser This...Fuck Bush.&quot; This event, as well as President Penley&#x27;s considerations of &quot;partnering&quot; out the &quot;Collegian&quot; by Gannett in January 2008, led to proposals in making CSU&#x27;s student media, including the &quot;Rocky Mountain Collegian&quot;, a not-for-profit organization independent from the university. This resulted in the entirety of CSU Student Media separating from the university to operate under an independent company, the Rocky Mountain Student Media Corporation.

KCSU is Colorado State&#x27;s student-run station, with a format focusing on alternative and college rock music, including indie rock, punk, hip-hop, and electronic music. News, sports, and weather updates along with talk programs and specialty shows round out the programming schedule. Broadcasting at 10,000 watts, KCSU is among the larger college stations in the country, reaching approximately 250,000 listeners.
KCSU first began broadcasting in 1964 as a station owned, operated, and financed by students. Following a long period as a professional station, KCSU again became student-run in 1995, at which time the current format was adopted. As with the Collegian and CTV, KCSU was hit hard by the 1997 flood, and for a time was forced to broadcast from remote locations. Now back in its original Lory Student Center location, KCSU has benefited from revamped production facilities and updated equipment.

CTV is CSU&#x27;s student-run television station, that allows students to hone their media skills- reporting, writing, producing, shooting, editing- in an educational environment. The station is a winner of fourteen Rocky Mountain Collegiate Media Association awards and a Student Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Heartland Chapter. Content includes news shows on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, a sports show on Mondays, and an entertainment show Thursdays. CTV was founded in 1989, and currently broadcasts weeknights on the university cable station (Comcast channel 11) at 8 pm, with reruns at 9 am and noon the next day.

Student-run magazine &quot;College Avenue&quot; was founded in 2005 with the goal, as put forth by its founding editors, of giving students a new forum to address controversial issues affecting the campus community from their vantage point. Since its first issue in the fall of 2005, the magazine has been released quarterly.

====Greek life====
Greek life at Colorado State began in the fall of 1915. Currently, 10% of undergraduates join one of CSUs 19 fraternities and 14 sororities. The CSU Inter-Fraternity Council acts as the governing body for the 19 fraternities, each with a delegate representative. Similarly, the CSU Panhellenic Council governs the sororities. CSU Greek organizations are involved in several philanthropic activities around campus, among them CSUnity, Cans around the Oval, Habitat for Humanity, and RamRide. The governing bodies recently raised $25,000 towards the sponsorship of a Habitat for Humanity home.

From 1932 until 1949, Colorado State University was home to the Eta chapter of Phrateres, a philanthropic-social organization for female college students. Eta was the seventh chapter installed and Phrateres eventually had over 20 chapters in Canada and the United States. (The chapter name &quot;Eta&quot; was reused for the chapter installed at Arizona State University in 1958.)

===Residence halls===
13 residence halls provide on-campus living for over 5,000 students. First-year students are required to live in one of the halls on campus, and upperclassman and graduate living are offered in the university-owned Aggie Village, which has space for 973 individuals. The halls also have several Living-Learning communities that directly link the on-campus living environment with a specific academic focus in Honors, engineering, natural sciences, health and wellness, equine sciences, leadership development, or pre-veterinary medicine. The Key Academic and Key Service Communities create an academically focused residential community for freshmen who share a desire for academic achievement, active involvement in classes, community service, campus activities, and appreciation of diversity. Residents share classes and take advantage of yearlong service opportunities with a close-knit group of 19 other students.

CSU Honors Program participants have the opportunity to live in the Honors Living Community. Academic Village, which opened in the fall 2007, houses Living Learning Communities for 180 Honors and 240 Engineering students. Students in the College of Natural Sciences can choose to live in Laurel Village, which opened in fall 2014.

===University apartments===
Students, faculty, and staff may choose to live in the university apartments. Colorado State University University Housing oversees University Village, International House, Aggie Village Family, and Aggie Village. Known as a &quot;global community&quot; Apartment Life&#x27;s mission to diversity shows in the fact that approximately 60 percent of residents and staff are from 80 different nations. Residents of CSU and Fort Collins community members enjoy a diverse amount of enrichment programs offered through the University Housing staff.

===Student demographics===
In fall 2007, CSU opened its doors to 24,983 students, among them 20,765 undergraduates, 2,332 master&#x27;s students, 1,347 doctoral students, and 539 professional students in the College of Biomedical and Veterinary Medicine. 80% of undergraduates are Colorado residents, and within the student population 50 states and 79 countries are represented. 52% of undergraduates are women, 13.2% of undergraduates are ethnic minorities (excluding international students), and 3% of undergraduates are 30 and over. Of minority students, 48% are Hispanic, 24% Asian American, 16% African American, and 12% Native American. Over the past ten years, minority enrollment has increased 35%, from 2,361 to 3,178, an increase from 10.9% to 13.2% of the student population. Though progress has been made, increasing minority enrollment at CSU has been a challenge for school administrators, one made yet more difficult by high dropout rates in many Colorado high schools with concentrated minority populations.

<text>Baron Thurlow, of Thurlow in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created on 11 June 1792 for the lawyer and politician Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, with remainder to his younger brothers and the heirs male of their bodies.

Thurlow had already on his appointment as Lord Chancellor on 3 June 1778 been created Baron Thurlow, of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. Lord Thurlow never married and on his death in 1806 the barony of 1778 became extinct, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1792 according to the special remainder by his nephew Edward, the second Baron. The latter was the son of the Right Reverend Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Durham from 1787 to 1791. Lord Thurlow gained a reputation as a minor poet. In 1813, he married the actress Mary Catherine Bolton, and they had three sons. In 1814 he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Hovell, in commemoration of his ancestor Sir Richard Hovell.

His grandson, the fifth Baron (who succeeded his elder brother), was a Liberal politician and served as Paymaster General in 1886. In 1873 he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Bruce, which was that of his father-in-law, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin. One year later, Lord Thurlow assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Cumming.

In 1952, to pay the death duties of his father, the sixth Baron, Henry, the seventh Baron, sold the family house in Surrey, Baynards Park. It was later owned by helicopter entrepreneur Alan Bristow, under whose ownership the Grade II-listed Elizabethan country house burnt down in 1980.

The title was then held by the seventh Baron, a soldier who won a DSO and bar in World War II and served as GOC in Malta. He was succeeded by his younger brother in 1971. The eighth Baron Thurlow was a diplomat and notably served as High Commissioner to New Zealand and Nigeria and as Governor of the Bahamas. In 2013 he was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baron, who in 2015 was elected by the hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Anania Edwards (July 3, 1949 – December 7, 2010) was an American attorney, author, and health care activist. She was married to John Edwards, the former U.S. Senator from North Carolina who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

Edwards lived a private life until her husband&#x27;s rise as senator and ultimately unsuccessful vice presidential and presidential campaigns. She was his chief policy advisor during his presidential bid, and was instrumental in pushing him towards more liberal stances on subjects such as universal health care. She was also an advocate for gay marriage, and was against the Iraq War, both topics about which she and her husband disagreed.

In the final years of her life, Edwards publicly dealt with her husband&#x27;s admission of an extramarital affair and her breast cancer, writing two books and making numerous media appearances. She separated from John Edwards in early 2010. On December 6, 2010, her family announced that her cancer had spread and that her doctors had stated that further treatment would be unproductive. She died the next day.

==Early life==
Mary Elizabeth Anania was born in 1949, the daughter of Mary Elizabeth Thweatt Anania (1923–2012) and Vincent Anania (1920–2008). She grew up in a military family, moving many times and never having a hometown. Her father, a United States Navy pilot, was transferred from military base to military base during her childhood and adolescence; for part of her childhood, she lived in Japan, where her father was stationed. She wrote in her book &quot;Saving Graces&quot; that one of the difficult relocations that she went through was moving during her senior year of high school. Some of her childhood friends&#x27; fathers were killed in war, and Edwards recalled childhood memories of attending their funerals. She also wrote about the stress of living on a military base and seeing a constant stream of wounded soldiers while her father was away fighting in Vietnam.

Edwards had two younger siblings: a brother, Jay Anania, a professor of film at New York University and a sister, Nancy Anania. Edwards graduated from the Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Virginia, then attended Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia. She transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), where she earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. After three years of postgraduate studies in English, she entered UNC&#x27;s School of Law and earned a Juris Doctor.

==Professional life==
Edwards began her career as a judicial law clerk for a federal judge Joseph Calvitt Clarke Jr.. She then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1978 to become an associate at the law firm of &quot;Harwell Barr Martin &amp; Sloan&quot;. In 1981, she and her husband moved their family to Raleigh, where she worked in the Office of the Attorney General and at the law firm &quot;Merriman Nicholls and Crampton&quot;. She kept the last name Anania until 1996, when she retired from the practice of law following the death of her son Wade; she changed her name to Elizabeth Anania Edwards in his memory. Following her retirement from law, she devoted much of her time to the administration of the Wade Edwards Foundation. She taught legal writing as an adjunct instructor at the University of North Carolina School of Law and worked as a substitute teacher in the Wake County Public Schools. In August 2009, she opened a furniture store in Chapel Hill.

In September 2006, Random House published her first book, &quot;Saving Graces: Finding Solace and Strength from Friends and Strangers&quot;, which focused on the ways different communities have helped her through the trials of her life, from her itinerant military childhood to the death of her son and her early bout with breast cancer. In May 2009, Random House published her second book, &quot;Resilience: Reflections on the Burdens and Gifts of Facing Life&#x27;s Adversities&quot;, in which she discussed the return of her illness, the deaths of her father and son and the effect of those events on her marriage, her husband&#x27;s infidelity, and the state of healthcare in America. Both books were bestsellers.

==Political activity==
During much of 2004, Edwards joined her husband, United States Democratic Vice Presidential nominee John Edwards, on the campaign trail. She took a similar role in her husband&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid, and was one of his closest advisers.

Edwards disagreed with her husband on the topic of same-sex marriage. She became a vocal advocate in 2007 when she stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why someone else&#x27;s marriage has anything to do with me. I&#x27;m completely comfortable with gay marriage.&quot;

On June 10, 2008, it was revealed that Edwards would be advising her husband&#x27;s former rival and eventual Democratic nominee, Barack Obama, on healthcare issues. Her husband also endorsed Obama during the later stages of the 2008 primary season.

Edwards became a senior fellow at the American Progress Action Fund and testified before Congress about healthcare reform on its behalf.

==Personal life==
Anania met John Edwards when they were both law students, and they married on July 30, 1977.

Early in their marriage, the couple had two children: Lucius &quot;Wade&quot; (b. 1979) and Catharine &quot;Cate&quot; (b. 1982). Wade died at age 16 on April 4, 1996, when he lost control of his Jeep and crashed while driving from their home in Raleigh to the family&#x27;s beach house near Wilmington. Three weeks before his death, Wade had been honored by First Lady Hillary Clinton at the White House as one of ten finalists in an essay contest sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Voice of America. Wade, accompanied by his parents and his sister, met North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms. After Wade died, Helms entered his essay and his obituary into the Congressional Record. Wade is buried in Raleigh&#x27;s Oakwood Cemetery, with a grave designed by Robert Mihaly.

Following Wade&#x27;s death, Elizabeth and John decided to have more children, and she underwent fertility treatments. They had a daughter, Emma Claire (b. 1998), and a son, John &quot;Jack&quot; (b. 2000). 

After John&#x27;s public admission on January 21, 2010 that he fathered a child with a mistress named Rielle Hunter, Elizabeth legally separated from him, intending to file for divorce after North Carolina&#x27;s mandatory one-year separation policy.

==Illness and death==
On November 3, 2004, the day her husband lost the vice presidency, Edwards announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She later revealed that she discovered a lump in her breast while on a campaign stop a few weeks earlier in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the midst of the campaign. Edwards became an activist for women&#x27;s health and cancer patients, and underwent oncology treatments. In a November 2006 comment on the &quot;Daily Kos&quot; website, Edwards stated that on her last visit, her oncologist informed her that her cancer was no longer present, writing, &quot;When I last went to my oncologist in North Carolina, she said that I had a lot going on in my life -- and that is an understatement -- but cancer was not one of them.&quot;

At a March 22, 2007 press conference, John and Elizabeth announced that her cancer had returned, and that his campaign for the Presidency would continue as before. The announcement included the information that she was asymptomatic, and therefore that she expected to be an active part of the campaign.

Her doctor, Dr. Lisa Carey of the University of North Carolina&#x27;s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, described the diagnosis as stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer with a spot in her rib and possibly her lung. In a March 25 interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Edwards said that there was also a spot in her hip found on her bone scan. The Edwardses and Carey stressed that the cancer was not curable, but was treatable. In early April 2007, Edwards was informed that her cancer might be treatable with anti-estrogen drugs. &quot;I consider that a good sign. It means there are more medications to which I can expect to be responsive,&quot; she told the Associated Press during a campaign stop with her husband in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. However, days later, in an interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s Jonathan Alter, she said, &quot;When I was first diagnosed, I was going to beat this. I was going to be the champion of cancer. And I don&#x27;t have that feeling now. The cancer will eventually kill me. It&#x27;s going to win this fight.&quot;

On December 6, 2010, Edwards&#x27; family announced that she had stopped cancer treatment after her doctors informed her that further treatment would be unproductive, because the cancer had metastasized to her liver. She had been advised she had several weeks to live. Her family members, including her estranged husband John, were with her. She posted her last message on Facebook:

Edwards died the next day of metastatic breast cancer at home in Chapel Hill; she was 61 years old. Her funeral, held at Edenton Street United Methodist Church in Raleigh, was open to the public and was attended by over 1,200 people, including North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue, Senators John Kerry and Kay Hagan, and Victoria Reggie Kennedy. Threats of protests by the anti-gay coalition led by Westboro Baptist Church attracted at least 300 local Raleigh residents prepared to counterprotest in support of the Edwards family, but only five Westboro protesters showed up and were kept blocks away. Elizabeth Edwards&#x27; marble monument was created by sculptor Robert Mihaly. She is interred with her son Wade in Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

His grandson, the third Baron, briefly represented St Michael&#x27;s in the House of Commons. His grandson, the fourth Baron, held minor office in the governments of Lord Salisbury, Arthur Balfour and David Lloyd George and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire. In 1912 Lord Kenyon assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Tyrell. the titles are held by his great-grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his brother in that year.

<doc id="475393" wikidata="Q7879841" url="?curid=475393" title="Hartree–Fock method">
<text>In computational physics and chemistry, the Hartree–Fock (HF) method is a method of approximation for the determination of the wave function and the energy of a quantum many-body system in a stationary state. The method is named after Douglas Hartree and Vladimir Fock.

The Hartree–Fock method often assumes that the exact &quot;N&quot;-body wave function of the system can be approximated by a single Slater determinant (in the case where the particles are fermions) or by a single permanent (in the case of bosons) of &quot;N&quot; spin-orbitals. By invoking the variational method, one can derive a set of &quot;N&quot;-coupled equations for the &quot;N&quot; spin orbitals. A solution of these equations yields the Hartree–Fock wave function and energy of the system. Hartree–Fock approximation is an instance of mean-field theory, where neglecting higher-order fluctuations in order parameter allows interaction terms to be replaced with quadratic terms, obtaining exactly solvable Hamiltonians.

Especially in the older literature, the Hartree–Fock method is also called the self-consistent field method (SCF). In deriving what is now called the Hartree equation as an approximate solution of the Schrödinger equation, Hartree required the final field as computed from the charge distribution to be &quot;self-consistent&quot; with the assumed initial field. Thus, self-consistency was a requirement of the solution. The solutions to the non-linear Hartree–Fock equations also behave as if each particle is subjected to the mean field created by all other particles (see the Fock operator below), and hence the terminology continued. The equations are almost universally solved by means of an iterative method, although the fixed-point iteration algorithm does not always converge.
This solution scheme is not the only one possible and is not an essential feature of the Hartree–Fock method.

The Hartree–Fock method finds its typical application in the solution of the Schrödinger equation for atoms, molecules, nanostructures and solids but it has also found widespread use in nuclear physics. (See Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov method for a discussion of its application in nuclear structure theory). In atomic structure theory, calculations may be for a spectrum with many excited energy levels, and consequently, the Hartree–Fock method for atoms assumes the wave function is a single configuration state function with well-defined quantum numbers and that the energy level is not necessarily the ground state.

For both atoms and molecules, the Hartree–Fock solution is the central starting point for most methods that describe the many-electron system more accurately.

The rest of this article will focus on applications in electronic structure theory suitable for molecules with the atom as a special case.
The discussion here is only for the restricted Hartree–Fock method, where the atom or molecule is a closed-shell system with all orbitals (atomic or molecular) doubly occupied. Open-shell systems, where some of the electrons are not paired, can be dealt with by either the restricted open-shell or the unrestricted Hartree–Fock methods.

== Brief history ==

===Early semi-empirical methods===
The origin of the Hartree–Fock method dates back to the end of the 1920s, soon after the discovery of the Schrödinger equation in 1926. Douglas Hartree&#x27;s methods were guided by some earlier, semi-empirical methods of the early 1920s (by E. Fues, R. B. Lindsay, and himself) set in the old quantum theory of Bohr.

In the Bohr model of the atom, the energy of a state with principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; is given in atomic units as formula_1. It was observed from atomic spectra that the energy levels of many-electron atoms are well described by applying a modified version of Bohr&#x27;s formula. By introducing the quantum defect &quot;d&quot; as an empirical parameter, the energy levels of a generic atom were well approximated by the formula formula_2, in the sense that one could reproduce fairly well the observed transitions levels observed in the X-ray region (for example, see the empirical discussion and derivation in Moseley&#x27;s law). The existence of a non-zero quantum defect was attributed to electron–electron repulsion, which clearly does not exist in the isolated hydrogen atom. This repulsion resulted in partial screening of the bare nuclear charge. These early researchers later introduced other potentials containing additional empirical parameters with the hope of better reproducing the experimental data.

===Hartree method===

In 1927, D. R. Hartree introduced a procedure, which he called the self-consistent field method, to calculate approximate wave functions and energies for atoms and ions. Hartree sought to do away with empirical parameters and solve the many-body time-independent Schrödinger equation from fundamental physical principles, i.e., ab initio. His first proposed method of solution became known as the &quot;Hartree method&quot;, or &quot;Hartree product&quot;. However, many of Hartree&#x27;s contemporaries did not understand the physical reasoning behind the Hartree method: it appeared to many people to contain empirical elements, and its connection to the solution of the many-body Schrödinger equation was unclear. However, in 1928 J. C. Slater and J. A. Gaunt independently showed that the Hartree method could be couched on a sounder theoretical basis by applying the variational principle to an ansatz (trial wave function) as a product of single-particle functions.

In 1930, Slater and V. A. Fock independently pointed out that the Hartree method did not respect the principle of antisymmetry of the wave function.
 The Hartree method used the Pauli exclusion principle in its older formulation, forbidding the presence of two electrons in the same quantum state. However, this was shown to be fundamentally incomplete in its neglect of quantum statistics.

===Hartree–Fock===
A solution to the lack of anti-symmetry in the Hartree method came when it was shown that a Slater determinant, a determinant of one-particle orbitals first used by Heisenberg and Dirac in 1926, trivially satisfies the antisymmetric property of the exact solution and hence is a suitable ansatz for applying the variational principle. The original Hartree method can then be viewed as an approximation to the Hartree–Fock method by neglecting exchange. Fock&#x27;s original method relied heavily on group theory and was too abstract for contemporary physicists to understand and implement. In 1935, Hartree reformulated the method to be more suitable for the purposes of calculation.

The Hartree–Fock method, despite its physically more accurate picture, was little used until the advent of electronic computers in the 1950s due to the much greater computational demands over the early Hartree method and empirical models. Initially, both the Hartree method and the Hartree–Fock method were applied exclusively to atoms, where the spherical symmetry of the system allowed one to greatly simplify the problem. These approximate methods were (and are) often used together with the central field approximation to impose the condition that electrons in the same shell have the same radial part and to restrict the variational solution to be a spin eigenfunction. Even so, calculating a solution by hand using the Hartree–Fock equations for a medium-sized atom was laborious; small molecules required computational resources far beyond what was available before 1950.

== Hartree–Fock algorithm ==

The Hartree–Fock method is typically used to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a multi-electron atom or molecule as described in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Since there are no known analytic solutions for many-electron systems (there &quot;are&quot; solutions for one-electron systems such as hydrogenic atoms and the diatomic hydrogen cation), the problem is solved numerically. Due to the nonlinearities introduced by the Hartree–Fock approximation, the equations are solved using a nonlinear method such as iteration, which gives rise to the name &quot;self-consistent field method.&quot;

=== Approximations ===
The Hartree–Fock method makes five major simplifications to deal with this task:
* The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is inherently assumed. The full molecular wave function is actually a function of the coordinates of each of the nuclei, in addition to those of the electrons.
* Typically, relativistic effects are completely neglected. The momentum operator is assumed to be completely non-relativistic.
* The variational solution is assumed to be a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, which are usually (but not always) chosen to be orthogonal. The finite basis set is assumed to be approximately complete.
* Each energy eigenfunction is assumed to be describable by a single Slater determinant, an antisymmetrized product of one-electron wave functions (i.e., orbitals).
* The mean-field approximation is implied. Effects arising from deviations from this assumption are neglected. These effects are often collectively used as a definition of the term electron correlation. However, the label &quot;electron correlation&quot; strictly spoken encompasses both the Coulomb correlation and Fermi correlation, and the latter is an effect of electron exchange, which is fully accounted for in the Hartree–Fock method. Stated in this terminology, the method only neglects the Coulomb correlation. However, this is an important flaw, accounting for (among others) Hartree–Fock&#x27;s inability to capture London dispersion.

Relaxation of the last two approximations give rise to many so-called post-Hartree–Fock methods.

=== Variational optimization of orbitals ===

The variational theorem states that for a time-independent Hamiltonian operator, any trial wave function will have an energy expectation value that is greater than or equal to the true ground-state wave function corresponding to the given Hamiltonian. Because of this, the Hartree–Fock energy is an upper bound to the true ground-state energy of a given molecule. In the context of the Hartree–Fock method, the best possible solution is at the &quot;Hartree–Fock limit&quot;; i.e., the limit of the Hartree–Fock energy as the basis set approaches completeness. (The other is the &quot;full-CI limit&quot;, where the last two approximations of the Hartree–Fock theory as described above are completely undone. It is only when both limits are attained that the exact solution, up to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, is obtained.) The Hartree–Fock energy is the minimal energy for a single Slater determinant.

The starting point for the Hartree–Fock method is a set of approximate one-electron wave functions known as &quot;spin-orbitals&quot;. For an atomic orbital calculation, these are typically the orbitals for a hydrogen-like atom (an atom with only one electron, but the appropriate nuclear charge). For a molecular orbital or crystalline calculation, the initial approximate one-electron wave functions are typically a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

The orbitals above only account for the presence of other electrons in an average manner. In the Hartree–Fock method, the effect of other electrons are accounted for in a mean-field theory context. The orbitals are optimized by requiring them to minimize the energy of the respective Slater determinant. The resultant variational conditions on the orbitals lead to a new one-electron operator, the Fock operator. At the minimum, the occupied orbitals are eigensolutions to the Fock operator via a unitary transformation between themselves. The Fock operator is an effective one-electron Hamiltonian operator being the sum of two terms. The first is a sum of kinetic-energy operators for each electron, the internuclear repulsion energy, and a sum of nuclear–electronic Coulombic attraction terms. The second are Coulombic repulsion terms between electrons in a mean-field theory description; a net repulsion energy for each electron in the system, which is calculated by treating all of the other electrons within the molecule as a smooth distribution of negative charge. This is the major simplification inherent in the Hartree–Fock method and is equivalent to the fifth simplification in the above list.

Since the Fock operator depends on the orbitals used to construct the corresponding Fock matrix, the eigenfunctions of the Fock operator are in turn new orbitals, which can be used to construct a new Fock operator. In this way, the Hartree–Fock orbitals are optimized iteratively until the change in total electronic energy falls below a predefined threshold. In this way, a set of self-consistent one-electron orbitals is calculated. The Hartree–Fock electronic wave function is then the Slater determinant constructed from these orbitals. Following the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, the Hartree–Fock wave function can then be used to compute any desired chemical or physical property within the framework of the Hartree–Fock method and the approximations employed.

To derive the Hartree-Fock equation we minimize the energy functional for N electrons with orthonormal constraints.

: formula_7

We choose a basis set formula_8 in which the Lagrange multiplier matrix formula_9 becomes diagonal, i.e. formula_10. Performing the variation, we obtain

: formula_11

The factor 1/2 before the double integrals in the molecular Hamiltonian drops out due to symmetry and the product rule. We may define the Fock operator to rewrite the equation

: formula_12

where the Coulomb operator formula_13 and the exchange operator formula_14 are defined as follows

: formula_15

The exchange operator has no classical analogue and can only be defined as an integral operator.

The solution formula_16 and formula_17 are called molecular orbital and orbital energy respectively.

Although Hartree-Fock equation appears in the form of a eigenvalue problem, the Fock operator itself depends on formula_18 and must be solved by a different technique.

===Total energy=== 
The optimal total energy formula_19 can be written in terms of molecular orbitals.

:formula_20

formula_21 and formula_22 are matrix elements of the Coulomb and exchange operators respectively, and formula_23 is the total electrostatic repulsion between all the nuclei in the molecule.

The total energy is not equal to the sum of orbital energies.

If the atom or molecule is closed shell, the total energy according to the Hartree-Fock method is
: formula_24

=== Linear combination of atomic orbitals ===
Typically, in modern Hartree–Fock calculations, the one-electron wave functions are approximated by a linear combination of atomic orbitals. These atomic orbitals are called Slater-type orbitals. Furthermore, it is very common for the &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; in use to actually be composed of a linear combination of one or more Gaussian-type orbitals, rather than Slater-type orbitals, in the interests of saving large amounts of computation time.

Various basis sets are used in practice, most of which are composed of Gaussian functions. In some applications, an orthogonalization method such as the Gram–Schmidt process is performed in order to produce a set of orthogonal basis functions. This can in principle save computational time when the computer is solving the Roothaan–Hall equations by converting the overlap matrix effectively to an identity matrix. However, in most modern computer programs for molecular Hartree–Fock calculations this procedure is not followed due to the high numerical cost of orthogonalization and the advent of more efficient, often sparse, algorithms for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, of which the Roothaan–Hall equations are an example.

== Numerical stability ==

Numerical stability can be a problem with this procedure and there are various ways of combatting this instability. One of the most basic and generally applicable is called &quot;F-mixing&quot; or damping. With F-mixing, once a single-electron wave function is calculated, it is not used directly. Instead, some combination of that calculated wave function and the previous wave functions for that electron is used, the most common being a simple linear combination of the calculated and immediately preceding wave function. A clever dodge, employed by Hartree, for atomic calculations was to increase the nuclear charge, thus pulling all the electrons closer together. As the system stabilised, this was gradually reduced to the correct charge. In molecular calculations a similar approach is sometimes used by first calculating the wave function for a positive ion and then to use these orbitals as the starting point for the neutral molecule. Modern molecular Hartree–Fock computer programs use a variety of methods to ensure convergence of the Roothaan–Hall equations.

== Weaknesses, extensions, and alternatives ==

Of the five simplifications outlined in the section &quot;Hartree–Fock algorithm&quot;, the fifth is typically the most important. Neglect of electron correlation can lead to large deviations from experimental results. A number of approaches to this weakness, collectively called post-Hartree–Fock methods, have been devised to include electron correlation to the multi-electron wave function. One of these approaches, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, treats correlation as a perturbation of the Fock operator. Others expand the true multi-electron wave function in terms of a linear combination of Slater determinants—such as multi-configurational self-consistent field, configuration interaction, quadratic configuration interaction, and complete active space SCF (CASSCF). Still others (such as variational quantum Monte Carlo) modify the Hartree–Fock wave function by multiplying it by a correlation function (&quot;Jastrow&quot; factor), a term which is explicitly a function of multiple electrons that cannot be decomposed into independent single-particle functions.

An alternative to Hartree–Fock calculations used in some cases is density functional theory, which treats both exchange and correlation energies, albeit approximately. Indeed, it is common to use calculations that are a hybrid of the two methods—the popular B3LYP scheme is one such hybrid functional method.
Another option is to use modern valence bond methods.

<text>Baron Auckland is a title in both the Peerage of Ireland and the Peerage of Great Britain. The first creation came in 1789 when the prominent politician and financial expert William Eden was made Baron Auckland in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1793, he was created Baron Auckland, of West Auckland in the County of Durham, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Eden notably served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, Ambassador to Spain, and President of the Board of Trade. His second son, the second Baron, was also a politician and served as Governor-General of India. In 1839 he was created Baron Eden, of Norwood in the County of Surrey, and Earl of Auckland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, he never married, and the barony of Eden and the earldom became extinct on his death while he was succeeded in the baronies of Auckland by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was Bishop of both Sodor and Man and Bath and Wells. The titles descended from father to son until the death of the sixth Baron in 1941. He was succeeded by his cousin, the seventh Baron. He was the son of George Eden, third son of the fourth Baron. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Baron. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1997.

The Barons Auckland are members of the prominent Eden family. The first Baron was the third son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland. His younger brother was Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley, while his elder brother was Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland. The latter was the great-great-grandfather of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, and the great-great-great-grandfather of John Eden, Baron Eden of Winton. The present Baron Auckland is also in remainder to the Eden Baronetcy of West Auckland, a title held by his kinsman the Lord Eden of Winton. William Eden, the eldest son of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for Woodstock. Sir Ashley Eden, third son of the third Baron, was an official and diplomat in British India.

The city of Auckland in New Zealand was named after the first Earl of Auckland, the patron of the city&#x27;s founder, William Hobson. Several Auckland landmarks, including the hill and suburb Mount Eden and the sports ground Eden Park, are named directly or indirectly after the family.

<doc id="475398" wikidata="Q4353920" url="?curid=475398" title="The Eye of Argon">
<text>The Eye of Argon is a 1970 sword and sorcery fantasy novella by Jim Theis (1953–2002) that narrates the adventures of the barbarian Grignr. It has been notorious within the science fiction and fantasy fandoms since its publication, described variously as &quot;one of [their] most beloved pieces of appalling prose,&quot; the &quot;infamous &#x27;worst fantasy novel ever&#x27; published for fans&#x27; enjoyment,&quot; and &quot;the apotheosis of bad writing&quot;. Science fiction conventions have long held group readings of the work in which participants are challenged to read it aloud for extended periods without laughing.

==History==

=== Writing and publication ===
The novella was written by Jim Theis, a St. Louis, Missouri, science fiction fan, at age 16. The work was first published in 1970 in &quot;OSFAN&quot; 10, the fanzine of the Ozark Science Fiction Association. Theis was &quot;a malaprop genius, a McGonagall of prose with an eerie gift for choosing the wrong word and then misapplying it,&quot; according to David Langford in &quot;SFX&quot;. Many misspellings also arose from the fanzine transcription&#x27;s poor typing. Theis was not completely happy with the published version and continued to work on the story. In an interview published three months later, he said:

In fact, I have changed it. I went over it for an independent study for English in school. You know, like adjectives changed and places where sentences should be deleted; things of this type. Even so it is nothing to be proud of and yet it is. Because how many people have had their first story published at 16—even if it is in a fanzine or a clubzine? How many writers have written a complete story at so early an age? Even so, &quot;Eye of Argon&quot; isn&#x27;t great. I basically don&#x27;t know much about structure or composition.

=== Spread and notoriety ===
Sometime in the 1970s, science fiction author Thomas N. Scortia obtained a copy of &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot;, which he mailed to horror novelist Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. Yarbro wrote to Darrell Schweitzer in 2003:

Tom Scortia sent me the fanzine pages as a kind of shared amusement, since both of us tended to look for poor use of language in stories. Don Simpson and I were still married then, and one of our entertainments was reading aloud to each other. This work was such a mish-mash that we took turns reading it to each other until we could stand no more...&lt;br&gt;About two weeks after the story arrived, we had a dinner party, mainly for MWA (Mystery Writers of America) and book dealer friends, and Joe Gores got to talking about some of the really hideous language misuse he had seen in recent anthology submissions and had brought along a few of the most egregious. I mentioned I had something that put his examples in the shade, and brought out &quot;The Eye of Argon.&quot; It was a huge hit. [&quot;Locus&quot; reviewer] Tom Whitmore asked if he could make a copy of it, and I loaned it to him, and readings of it started to become a hideous entertainment. I never typed out a copy of it, but I am afraid I did start the ball rolling.

The work was copied and distributed widely around science fiction fandom, often uncredited. Readings quickly became a common activity at science fiction conventions: &quot;People sit in a circle and take turns reading from photocopies of the story. The reader&#x27;s turn is over when he begins to laugh uncontrollably.&quot;

=== Later editions ===
An edition of &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; was published in 1987 by Hypatia Press, illustrated by Lynne Adams (). The story was also reprinted in 1995, attributed to &quot;G. Ecordian,&quot; as a nod to the story&#x27;s protagonist.

Later, a version became available on the Internet, ARGON.DOC, which was manually transcribed by Don Simpson and placed online by Doug Faunt. It bears this note at the bottom:

No mere transcription can give the true flavor of the original printing of The Eye of Argon. It was mimeographed with stencils cut on an elite manual typewriter. Many letters were so faint as to be barely readable, others were overstruck, and some that were to be removed never got painted out with correction fluid. Usually, only one space separated sentences, while paragraphs were separated by a blank line and were indented ten spaces. Many words were grotesquely hyphenated. And there were illustrations—I cannot do them justice in mere words, but they were a match for the text. These are the major losses of this version (#02) of TEoA.&lt;br&gt;

Otherwise, all effort has been made to retain the full and correct text, preserving even mis-spellings and dropped spaces. An excellent proofreader has checked it for errors both omitted and committed. What mismatches remain are mine.

However, the online version was found to contain errors when an original copy of the fanzine was discovered in Temple University&#x27;s Paskow Science Fiction Collection in 2003.

===Finding the lost ending===
The ending of &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; was missing from Scortia&#x27;s copy and all the copies made of it. The last page of the story was on the last sheet of the fanzine, which had fallen off the staples. The online version ended with the phrase &quot;-END OF AVAILABLE COPY-&quot;. The original copy found in 2003 was also incomplete.

The ending was considered lost until a complete copy of the fanzine was discovered by librarian Gene Bundy at the Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library at Eastern New Mexico University in 2005. Bundy reported the discovery to Lee Weinstein, who had found the copy in Philadelphia, and subsequently published the article &quot;In Search of Jim Theis&quot; in the &quot;New York Review of Science Fiction&quot; 195.

In 2006, Wildside Press published a paperback edition of the complete work.

==Plot summary==

; Chapter 1: The story begins with a sword fight between the Ecordian barbarian Grignr and some mercenaries who are pursuing him. After killing them, Grignr resumes his journey through the empire of Noregolia to the city of Gorzom.
; Chapter 2: Grignr arrives in Gorzom and goes to a tavern, where he makes love to a prostitute with a &quot;lithe, opaque nose&quot;. A drunken guard challenges him over the woman; he beheads the guard, but is arrested by the man&#x27;s companions and brought before the local prince Agaphim. Infuriated after being insulted by Grignr, Agaphim condemns him to a life of forced labor. Enraged, Grignr seizes a sword and stabs the prince&#x27;s advisor Agafnd; he is about to kill Agaphim when he is knocked unconscious. This chapter contains the first of several occasions when the word &quot;slut&quot; is applied to a man, presumably as an insult.
; Chapter 3: Grignr awakens in a dark underground cell. He sits despondently, thinking of his homeland.
; Chapter 3½: A group of &quot;shamen [sic]&quot; prepare to sacrifice a young woman to the titular Eye of Argon, a grotesque &quot;many fauceted scarlet emerald [sic]&quot; idol.
; Chapter 4: Losing track of time, Grignr sits bored and anguished in his cell. A large rat attacks him and he decapitates it. It then inspires him with a plan involving the corpse of the rat, which he dismembers.
; Chapter 5: The pagan ritual proceeds, with a priest ordering the young woman up to the altar. When she ignores him, he attempts to grope her. She vomits onto the priest, who chokes her. She then disables him with a hard kick between the testicles, which causes him to ooze ichor. Enraged, the other shamans molest her.
; Chapter 6: Grignr is taken from his cell by two soldiers. He takes the rat&#x27;s pelvis, which he has fashioned into a dagger, and slits one soldier&#x27;s throat. He then strangles the second and takes his clothes, torch, and ax. He wanders the catacombs for a time, finding a storeroom, and narrowly avoids being killed by a booby-trap. Below this room, he finds the palace mausoleum. He resets the booby-trap in case he is being pursued.
:He hears a scream apparently coming from a sarcophagus. He opens it to find the scream is coming from below. He opens a trap door, finding the sacrifice and the Eye of Argon. Seeing a shaman about to sacrifice the young woman, Grignr plows into the group of shamans with the ax and takes the Eye. The young woman, Carthena, turns out to be the tavern wench from chapter 2. She and Grignr depart.
; Chapter 7: One priest, who had been suffering an epileptic seizure during Grignr&#x27;s attack, recovers. Maddened by what he sees, he draws a scimitar and follows Grignr and Carthena through the trap door in the ceiling.
; Chapter 7½: The priest strikes at Grignr but he triggers, and is killed by, the reset booby-trap before his sword can connect. Carthena tells Grignr of the prince, Agaphim, who had condemned him to the mines. They encounter Agaphim and kill him, as well as his inexplicably resurrected advisor Agafnd. As Grignr and Carthena leave, he pulls the Eye of Argon out of his pouch to admire. The jewel melts and turns into a writhing blob with a leech-like mouth, which attacks him and begins sucking his blood. Carthena faints; Grignr grabs a torch and thrusts it into the blob&#x27;s mouth.

Traditional photocopied and Internet versions end at this point, incomplete since page 49 of the fanzine had been lost. The ending was rediscovered in 2004 and published in &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot; #198, February 2005.

; The Lost Ending (Remainder of Ch. 7½): The blob explodes into a thousand pieces, leaving &quot;a dark red blotch upon the face of the earth, blotching things up.&quot; Grignr and the still-unconscious Carthena ride off into the distance.

==Readings==

===At SF conventions===
Since at least the 1990s &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; has been read aloud, usually as charity events, at several American science fiction conventions, such as OryCon, LosCon, and 5Con. A panel of volunteers would take turns reading passages, and the audience would bid to stop that passage or continue (for some set number of minutes, or paragraphs after each successful bid). At some of these events, some members of the audience acted out the scenes being read as mime.

===As a party game===
Reading &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; aloud has been made into a game, as described by SF critic Dave Langford in &quot;SFX magazine&quot;: &quot;The challenge of death, at SF conventions, is to read &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; aloud, straight-faced, without choking and falling over. The grandmaster challenge is to read it with a squeaky voice after inhaling helium. What fun we fans have.&quot; To encourage the game, a &quot;Competitive Reading Edition&quot; of the story is freely available, which is a careful copy of the original publication.

==Author==
James Francis &quot;Jim&quot; Theis (pronounced ; August 9, 1953 – March 26, 2002) wrote &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot; at age 16. It was published in the Ozark Science Fiction Association fanzine on August 21, 1970, a few days after his seventeenth birthday. He published one more fantasy story in another fanzine, &quot;Son of Grafan&quot;, in 1972, and later pursued and earned a degree in journalism. He married, and was the father of two boys, and his hobbies included collecting books, comics, and German swords. He also collected, traded, and sold tapes of radio programs of the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s under the business name The Phantom of Radio Past. After his death at age 48, his family requested donations to the American Heart Association.

In an interview on &quot;Hour 25&quot; (the presenters of which would periodically stage a reading of &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot;) in 1984, Theis stated that he was hurt that his story was being mocked and vowed never to write again. In a later interview he complained about being mocked for something he had written thirty years ago, at age sixteen. He participated in readings of the story in St. Louis at the Archon convention. A copy of the 1995 reprinting was sent to him, with no response.

===Other attributed authors and distributors===
Before copies of the original fanzine were rediscovered, the story&#x27;s authorship was in doubt. Because the novelette was at least once re-typed and photocopied for distribution without provenance, many readers found it hard to believe the story was not a collaborative effort, satire, or both. A now-defunct site called &quot;Wulf&#x27;s &#x27;Eye of Argon&#x27; Shrine&quot; argued that the story &quot;was actually well paced and plotted,&quot; and noted that &quot;at least one sf professional today claims that the story was a cunning piece of satire passed off as real fan fiction.&quot;

David Langford reported the following, sent in by author Michael Swanwick, in &quot;Ansible&quot; #193:

I had a surprising conversation at Readercon with literary superstar Samuel R. Delany, who told me of how at an early Clarion the students and teachers had decided to see exactly how bad a story they could write if they put their minds to it. Chip [Delany] himself contributed a paragraph to the round robin effort. Its title? &quot;The Eye of Argon&quot;.

Author Stephen Goldin said that, during a convention, he met a woman who told him she had done the actual mimeographing for the &quot;OSFAN&quot; publication. Lee Weinstein reports that he had originally heard that Dorothy Fontana had distributed the photocopies. Weinstein, however, later discovered Usenet posts by Richard W. Zellich, who was involved in running the St. Louis–area convention Archon. Zellich reported in 1991 posts that Jim Theis was real and attended the convention several times.

What Weinstein calls &quot;the smoking gun&quot; with regard to Theis&#x27; authorship was a 1994 posting from New York fan Richard Newsome, who transcribed an interview with Theis published in &quot;OSFAN&quot; 13. The interviewer praised Theis, saying, &quot;When they were kidding you about it, you took it so well...You showed real character.&quot; Theis replied, &quot;I mean, it was easier than showing bad character and inviting trouble.&quot;

<text>Arthur Rackham (19 September 1867 – 6 September 1939) was an English book illustrator. He is recognised as one of the leading figures during the Golden Age of British book illustration. His work is noted for its robust pen and ink drawings, which were combined with the use of watercolour, a technique he developed due to his background as a journalistic illustrator.

Rackham&#x27;s 51 colour pieces for the early American tale &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; became a turning point in the production of books since – through colour-separated printing – it featured the accurate reproduction of colour artwork. His best-known works also include the illustrations for &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;, and &quot;Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm&quot;.

==Biography==
Rackham was born at 210 South Lambeth Road, Vauxhall, London as one of 12 children. In 1884, at the age of 17, he was sent on an ocean voyage to Australia to improve his fragile health, accompanied by two aunts. At the age of 18, he worked as an insurance clerk at the Westminster Fire Office and began studying part-time at the Lambeth School of Art.

In 1892, he left his job and started working for the &quot;Westminster Budget&quot; as a reporter and illustrator. His first book of illustrations were published in 1893 in &quot;To the Other Side&quot; by Thomas Rhodes, but his first serious commission was in 1894 for &quot;The Dolly Dialogues&quot;, the collected sketches of Anthony Hope, who later went on to write &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. Book illustrating then became Rackham&#x27;s career for the rest of his life.

By the turn of the century, Rackham had developed a reputation for pen and ink fantasy illustration with richly illustrated gift books such as &quot;The Ingoldsby Legends&quot; (1898), &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (both 1900). This was developed further through the austere years of the Boer War with regular contributions to children&#x27;s periodicals such as &quot;Little Folks&quot; and &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1901 he moved to Wychcombe Studios near Haverstock Hill, and in 1903 married his neighbour Edyth Starkie. Edyth suffered a miscarriage in 1904, but the couple had one daughter, Barbara, in 1908. Although acknowledged as an accomplished black-and-white book illustrator for some years, it was the publication of his full-colour plates to Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; by Heinemann in 1905 that particularly brought him into public attention, his reputation being confirmed the following year with J.M.Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Income from the books was greatly augmented by annual exhibitions of the artwork at the Leicester Galleries. Rackham won a gold medal at the Milan International Exhibition in 1906 and another one at the Barcelona International Exposition in 1912. His works were included in numerous exhibitions, including one at the Louvre in Paris in 1914. Rackham was a member of the Art Workers&#x27; Guild and was elected its Master in 1919.

From 1906 the family lived in Chalcot Gardens, near Haverstock Hill, until moving from London to Houghton, West Sussex in 1920. In 1929, the family settled into a newly built property in Limpsfield, Surrey. Ten years later, Arthur Rackham died at home of cancer.

==Significance==
Arthur Rackham is widely regarded as one of the leading illustrators from the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of British book illustration which roughly encompassed the years from 1890 until the end of the First World War. During that period, there was a strong market for high quality illustrated books which typically were given as Christmas gifts. Many of Rackham&#x27;s books were produced in a &quot;de luxe&quot; limited edition, often vellum bound and usually signed, as well as a smaller, less ornately bound quarto &#x27;trade&#x27; edition. This was sometimes followed by a more modestly presented octavo edition in subsequent years for particularly popular books. The onset of the war in 1914 curtailed the market for such quality books, and the public&#x27;s taste for fantasy and fairies also declined in the 1920s.

Sutherland, referring to Rackham&#x27;s work in the 20th century, states: &quot;Rackham was, without doubt, one of the finest illustrators of the century.&quot; In his survey of British Book Illustration, Salaman stated: &quot;Mr. Rackham stands apart from all the other illustrators of the day; his genius is so thoroughly original. Scores of others have depicted fairyland and wonderland, but who else has given us so absolutely individual and persuasively suggestive a vision of their marvels and allurements? Whose elves are so elfish, whose witches and gnomes are so convincingly of their kind, as Mr. Rackham&#x27;s?&quot;

Carpenter and Prichard noted that &quot;For all the virtuosity of his work in colour, Rackham remained an artist in line, his mastery having its roots in his early work for periodicals, then breaking free to create the swirling intricate pictures of his prime, and finally reaching the economy and impressionism of his last work.&quot; They also remarked on his decline: &quot;Rackham made his name in a heyday of fairy literature and other fantasy which the First World War brought to an end.&quot; House stated that Rackham &quot;concentrated on the illustration of books and particularly those of a mystical, magic or legendary background. He very soon established himself as one of the foremost Edwardian illustrators and was triumphant in the early 1900s when colour printing first enabled him to use subtle tints and muted tones to represent age and timelessness. Rackham&#x27;s imaginative eye saw all forms with the eyes of childhood and created a world that was half reassuring and half frightening.&quot;

Hamilton summarised his article on Rackham in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography thus: &quot;Rackham brought a renewed sense of excitement to book illustration that coincided with the rapid developments in printing technology in the early twentieth century. Working with subtle colour and wiry line, he exploited the growing strengths of commercial printing to create imagery and characterizations that reinvigorated children&#x27;s literature, electrified young readers, and dominated the art of book illustration at the start of a new century.&quot;

Arthur Rackham&#x27;s works have become very popular since his death, both in North America and Britain. His images have been widely used by the greeting card industry and many of his books are still in print or have been recently available in both paperback and hardback editions. His original drawings and paintings are keenly sought at the major international art auction houses.

==Technique==
Rackham&#x27;s illustrations were chiefly based on robust pen and India ink drawings. Rackham gradually perfected his own uniquely expressive line from his background in journalistic illustration, paired with subtle use of watercolour, a technique which he was able to exploit due to technological developments in photographic reproduction. With this development, Rackham&#x27;s illustrations no longer needed an engraver (lacking Rackham&#x27;s talent) to cut clean lines on a wood or metal plate for printing because the artist merely had his works photographed and mechanically reproduced.

Rackham would first lightly block in shapes and details of the drawing with a soft pencil, for the more elaborate colour plates often utilising one of a small selection of compositional devices. Over this, he would then carefully work in lines of pen and India ink, removing the pencil traces after the drawing had begun to take form. For colour pictures, Rackham preferred the 3-colour process or trichromatic printing, which reproduced the delicate half-tones of photography through letterpress printing. He would begin painting by building up multiple thin washes of watercolour creating translucent tints. One of the disadvantages of the 3-colour (later 4-colour) printing process in the early years was that definition could be lost in the final print. Rackham would sometimes compensate for this by over-inking his drawings once more after painting. He would also go on to expand the use of silhouette cuts in illustration work, particularly in the period after the First World War, as exemplified by his &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

Typically, Rackham contributed both colour and monotone illustrations towards the works incorporating his images – and in the case of &quot;Hawthorne&#x27;s Wonder Book&quot;, he also provided a number of part-coloured block images similar in style to Meiji era Japanese woodblocks.

Rackham&#x27;s work has been described as a fusion of a northern European &#x27;Nordic&#x27; style strongly influenced by the Japanese woodblock tradition of the early 19th century. However, his style is distinctly British and follows a long tradition of Victorian fairy painting and close and often uncomposed studies of understated brier-patch nature in the inclement British climate, as was common in the works of Joseph Noel Paton, the Pre-Raphaelites, and the more nature and fairy-inspired work of John Atkinson Grimshaw. The evolution in Rackham&#x27;s work towards strong illustrative line and abstracted representation fuses these elements with British interpretations of the organic and sinuous forms of Art Nouveau and wider Arts &amp; Crafts influences, such as the Glasgow Style or &quot;Spook School&quot;, especially evident in the work of Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh. This impacts on reception of Rackham as far as the work may be viewed as illustrative painted art or as more decorative art suited to muted colour schemes; something that may have influenced a later 20th century revival in interest in Rackham for the creation of wall poster prints. The sombrely expressive and quite Gothic Horror elements of Rackham&#x27;s work is reminiscent of some compositions by the French illustrator Gustave Doré, although any aspect of horror is underplayed for an audience which was intended by majority to be readers of childhood fantasy.

==Influence==
Rackham&#x27;s work influenced a number of artists. These include Gustaf Tenggren, Brian Froud, William Stout, Tony DiTerlizzi, and Abigail Larson. Froud cites the early influence of Rackham, &quot;in particular, [Rackham&#x27;s] drawings of trees that had faces&quot;, as sparking his interest in illustrating fairy tales, and describes having had a love of nature from childhood that has informed his style.

According to Arthur Rankin, the visual style of the 1977 film &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was based on early illustrations by Rackham.

The original Broadway Costume Designer for &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, Ann Hould-Ward discussed looking at Arthur Rankin&#x27;s illustrations as a starting place for the costume design. &quot;Then, we spent a lot of time looking at illustrations through time of all of
these various fairy tales. We spent a lot of time with the [Arthur] Rackham versions, which are
those are beautiful illustrations...&quot;
In one of the featurettes on the DVD of &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, and in the commentary track for &quot;Hellboy&quot;, director Guillermo del Toro cites Rackham as an influence on the design of &quot;The Faun&quot; of &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;. He liked the dark tone of Rackham&#x27;s gritty realistic drawings and had decided to incorporate that into the film. In &quot;Hellboy&quot;, the design of the tree growing out of the altar in the ruined abbey off the coast of Scotland where Hellboy was brought over, is actually referred to as a &quot;Rackham tree&quot; by the director.

<doc id="475407" wikidata="Q1268170" url="?curid=475407" title="Sanday, Orkney">
<text>Sanday (, ) is one of the inhabited islands of Orkney that lies off the north coast of mainland Scotland. With an area of , it is the third largest of the Orkney Islands. The main centres of population are Lady Village and Kettletoft. Sanday can be reached by Orkney Ferries or by plane (Sanday Airport) from Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. On Sanday, an on-demand public minibus service allows connecting to the ferry.

==Etymology==
The Picts were the pre-Norse inhabitants of Sanday but very few placenames remain from this period. The Norse named the island or because of the predominance of sandy beaches and this became &quot;Sanday&quot; during the Scots- and English-speaking periods. The similarly named Sandoy is in the Faroe Islands.

Many names of places and natural features derive from Old Norse. According to Dorward (1995), the placename &quot;Kettletoft&quot; means &#x27;Kettil&#x27;s croft&#x27; although &quot;toft&quot; in this context may mean &#x27;abandoned site of house&#x27; from the Norse . The suffix &quot;-bister&quot; found in Sellibister and Overbister is from meaning &#x27;dwelling&#x27; or &#x27;farm&#x27;. Other common suffixes are &quot;-wick&quot; and &quot;-ness&quot; from the Norse and and meaning &#x27;bay&#x27; and &#x27;headland&#x27; respectively. According to Frances Groome, Otterswick was originally known as .

==Environment==
===Geography and geology===
Sanday lies south of North Ronaldsay and east of Eday and Westray. It is divided naturally into two roughly equal halves by Otterswick, a bay which runs in from the north, and Kettletoft Bay in the south. The narrow isthmus between them formed the boundary between the historic parishes Cross and Burness to the west and Lady to the east. The novelist Eric Linklater described Sanday&#x27;s shape seen from the air as being like that of a giant fossilised bat. Tresness, a tied island, extends from the south of Lady parish. It is connected to Sanday by a long tombolo which is backed with some of Scotland&#x27;s highest sand dunes.

Changing post-glacial sea levels will have much altered the shape of this low-lying island since the last ice age. William Traill described a gale in 1838 which removed of sand in Otterswick Bay. This revealed a dark layer of decayed vegetation under fallen trees up to in diameter. The trees lay &quot;as if felled by a storm&quot; and were visible under the sea for . A search for these tree remains in the 20th century was unsuccessful.

Inland it is fertile and agricultural and there is some commercial lobster fishing. The underlying geology is predominantly Devonian sediments of the Rousay flagstone group with Eday sandstone in the south east.

There are several small bodies of freshwater on the island including North Loch, Bea Loch near Kettletoft and Roos Loch on the Burness peninsula.

===Natural history===

Seals and Eurasian otters can be found in and around Sanday. There are several SSSIs on the island and the marine coast around the east of the island is designated a Special Protection Area due to presence of sand dune and machair habitats, rare outside the Hebrides, as well as extensive intertidal flats and saltmarsh.

The eastern coast of Sanday has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports wintering and breeding waders.

==Transport==
===Airport===
Loganair operates regular flights from Kirkwall Airport to Sanday Airport. There are also flights from Sanday to Stronsay Airport, and North Ronaldsay Airport.

===Ferry===
Orkney Ferries operates a regular ferry service between Kirkwall and Sanday, with the boat coming in at Loth Pier in Cross.

===Bus===
The Sanday Bus operates a timetabled bus service around the island of Sanday which eventually reaches Loth Pier, via Kettletoft, Lady Village, and Sanday Airport.

===Train===
The Sanday Light Railway operated a rail service between Braeswick and Laminess, between three stations, between 1999 and 2006. The railway eventually shut at the end of 2006 and by 2020 the last of the tracks had been lifted and removed.

==Prehistory==
The Neolithic Quoyness chambered cairn, dates from around 2900 BC. An arc of Bronze Age mounds surrounds this cairn on the Elsness peninsula. A large man-made mound at Pool was excavated in the 1980s. This indicated a Neolithic structure made of turf or burnt peat, a later pre-Viking sub-circular structure with pavings and cells, and a Viking stone and turf rectangular building dated to the late 8th or early 9th century. Various implements were also discovered including pre-Norse hipped pins and pottery from both the pre-Viking and Norse periods. A predominance of fish and animal bones suggests the site was used for meat processing.

Excavations of a mound in 1991, ahead of road development on the Spurness peninsula discovered two cist burials with some cremated human remains from the Early to Middle Bronze Age. Notable finds were a piece drift wood from the Americas and a soapstone (steatite) vessels. Soapstone is not natural to Orkney and analysis indicated that the material came from Catpund in Shetland and that people or goods were moving between the two archipelagos at that time.

Storms in January 2005 exposed a Bronze Age burnt burial mound at Meur. There are several ruined Iron Age brochs on the island such as the Broch of Wasso, a mound at Tres Ness. 
The nature of the culture that built the brochs remains a matter of debate but it is known that later Iron Age Orkney was part of the Pictish kingdom and from at least the mid-6th century onwards that Christianity had spread to the islands. However, the archeological record for this period is sparse and little is known of life on Sanday at this time beyond that which can be assumed from a knowledge of Pictish society elsewhere. The local heritage centre shows a Pictish decorated stone showing a cross.

In September 2021, archaeologists from the Central Lancashire University announced the discovery of  two polished stone balls in a 5500 years-old Neolithic burial tomb. According to Dr Hugo Anderson, second object was as the “size of a cricket ball, perfectly spherical and beautifully finished&quot;.

== History ==
Orkney became part of the Scandinavian polity from perhaps the 9th century onwards. In 1991 the Scar boat burial was discovered on the coast of Sanday near Burness. This Norse-era vessel, which had been long and wide, had rotted away, leaving more than 300 iron rivets. The enclosure, dated to 875—950 AD, was found to contain the remains of a man, a woman, and a child, along with numerous grave goods. These included a sword, quiver with arrows, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar dragon plaque, made from whale bone.

During the medieval period Sanday had 36 ouncelands, which may have been divided into two &#x27;huseby&#x27; districts for taxation purposes with Lady to the east forming a unit with Stronsay and Cross and Burness to the west being combined with Eday and other isles to the west and north. The main farm for the western district may have been located between Pool Bay and Warsetter at a site called Housay that is now just a mound.

In the mid-17th century an annexe to Blaeu&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Novus&quot; of Scotland recorded that Sanday&#x27;s low lying topography meant that &quot;shipwreck often occurs to those who sail there at night. The inhabitants of Sanday earnestly and often desire this to happen, so that they get a supply of material for fire from the wrecked ships&quot;. The writer went on to state that the lack of peat meant that dried seaweed was &quot;saved like treasure&quot; for cooking fires and that only the better-off citizens could afford to bring peat from Eday &quot;over the most fearful sea&quot;.
In March 1633, Marion Richart or Layland of Sanday was accused of witchcraft. Her grandson James Fisher said he had seen her and Catrine Miller at an empty house called the House of Howing Greenay, sitting beside the devil in the likeness of a &quot;black man&quot;. Other witnesses declared she had charmed a fisherman&#x27;s bait with the paws of her cat, healed a sick woman with a charm, and charmed milk from cows on Stronsay. She was tried at Kirkwall, found guilty, strangled and burnt.

Writing in the early 18th century, the Rev. John Brand described island life thus: &quot;Both Men and Women are fashionable in their cloths, no Men here use Plaids, as they do in our Highlands; In the North Isles of Sanda Westra &amp;c. Many of the Countrey People wear a piece of a Skin, as of a Scale, comonly called a Selch, Calf or the lik. for Shoes, which they fasten to their Feet with stringes or thongs of Leather. Their Houses are in good order, and well furnished, according to their qualities. They generally speak English.&quot;
As part of the agricultural improvement movement of the 19th century the brothers Malcolm and Samuel Laing created a &quot;New Model Farm&quot; near the Loth ferry terminal at the south end of the island. They introduced merino sheep, and the ruins of the steam engine house and the red-brick chimney and boiler house are still visible. Although such innovations brought increased productivity and were widely copied in Orkney they also impoverished the substantial population of landless cottars who were increasingly marginalised.

During World War II, the Royal Air Force built a Chain Home radar station at Whale Head near Lop Ness. This necessitated the building of a large camp at Langamay to house the military personnel, which incorporated a cinema.

Sanday also once boasted the most northerly passenger railway in the United Kingdom, a privately owned rideable miniature installation near Braeswick, the Sanday Light Railway.

In June 2009, 54 year old local resident Robert Rose was murdered by residents John Campbell and Stephen Crummack. The two men buried Rose&#x27;s body in the sand dunes at Sty Wick on the south side of the island, and drove his car to Loth Pier, in an attempt to make residents believe that he left the island on the ferry. After investigation, Campbell was found guilty of murder and Crummack was found guilty of culpable homicide, and the pair were sentenced to 16 years and 11 years respectively at the Justiciary Buildings in Glasgow in March 2010.

==Start Point Lighthouse==
Start Point Lighthouse stands on the neighbouring tidal island of Start Point, locally known as Start Island. The lighthouse was completed on 2 October 1806 by engineer Thomas Smith. It was the first Scottish lighthouse to have a clockwork-driven revolving parabolic reflector creating a sweeping beam. The reflector was later replaced by a Fresnel lens. In 1870 the lighthouse was rebuilt. Since 1915, it has been painted by distinctive black and white vertical stripes which are unique in Scotland. The light was automated in 1962 and is powered by a bank of 36 solar panels.

Despite the presence of the lighthouse, HMS &quot;Goldfinch&quot; was wrecked in fog on Start Point in 1915.

==Current island activities==
Sanday boasts two golf courses: a 9-hole links course of 2,600 yards run by Sanday Golf Club and the one-hole meadowland &quot;Peedie Golf Course&quot; of (believed to be Scotland&#x27;s shortest) at West Manse.

In 2004, three wind turbines with an installed capacity of 8.25 Megawatts were erected by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) at Spurness. Sanday Community Council successfully negotiated a wind farm community fund with SSE which will be benefitting the people of the island for the lifetime of the turbines, anticipated to be 20 to 25 years. By 2012, these wind turbines were replaced by 5 newer ones by Scottish and Southern Energy. This installation also generates income intended to benefit the people in Sanday, on the one hand via grants distributed by the Sanday Community Council and on the other by financing the Sanday Development Trust.

In 1996, the Sanday Development Group was formed to promote tourism. This group became Sanday Development Trust in 2004, which has a vision to:

Create an economically prosperous, sustainable community that is connected with the wider world, but remains a safe, clean environment, where we are proud to live, able to work, to bring up and educate our children, to fulfill our own hopes and ambitions, and to grow old gracefully, enjoying a quality of life that is second to none.

Projects include the establishment of a sports hall and youth centre, the creation of a local sound archive, and until February 2020, a Countryside Ranger service.
A district tartan has been designed for Sanday by one of the island&#x27;s residents, although it has not yet been officially adopted by the island authorities. It represents the sea, the distinctive sandy beaches and green meadows of the island, and the vertical stripes of Start Point lighthouse.

In July 2008 a concert held on the island was the culmination of an innovative musical project. The main aim of project was to set up a music-teacher training programme that would provide additional music tuition in the school and throughout the community.

A shop where islanders can sell craft products has existed since 2016.

==Folklore==
There is a legend that a Sanday girl was once sold a book called &quot;The Book of Black Art&quot; by a witch, and that the Devil would claim the soul of anyone who still owned the book at their death. This book was only able to be passed on by selling it. A local clergyman (Matthew Armour) took it off her hands and he managed to get rid of it by means not described in the tradition before his death in 1903. At the ruined Kirk of Lady, near Overbister, are the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Clawmarks&quot;: incised parallel grooves in the parapet of the kirk.

<doc id="475409" wikidata="Q6721750" url="?curid=475409" title="MacBird!">
<text>MacBird! is a 1966 satire by Barbara Garson. It was self-published (&#x27;Grassy Knoll Press&#x27;) as a pamphlet, and the full text appeared in the December 1966 issue of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine. It was staged in February 1967.

The play superimposes the John F. Kennedy assassination onto the plot of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

== Plot ==
The play burlesques Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, with lines drawn from other plays such as &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot;, with Texas and Boston accents. The plot follows MacBird from the 1960 Democratic National Convention, when he becomes John Ken O&#x27;Dunc&#x27;s Vice President (&quot;Hail, Vice-President thou art!&quot;), to Ken O&#x27;Dunc&#x27;s assassination, at the urging of Lady MacBird. Robert Ken O&#x27;Dunc then defeats MacBird at the 1968 convention.

In the play, Kennedy becomes &quot;John Ken O&#x27;Dunc&quot;, Lyndon Johnson becomes &quot;MacBird&quot;, Lady Bird Johnson becomes &quot;Lady MacBird&quot;, etc. As Macbeth assassinates Duncan, so MacBird assassinates Ken O&#x27;Dunc. As Macbeth is defeated by Macduff, so MacBird is defeated by Robert Ken O&#x27;Dunc (Robert F. Kennedy).

The play also features the Three Witches, in the form of a student radical, a Nation of Islam member, and a working-class union member. The recently deceased Adlai Stevenson II was depicted as &#x27;The Egg of Head&#x27; (the term &#x27;egghead&#x27; having been coined in the 1950s to describe intellectual supporters of Stevenson).

In a 2006 &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview, Garson said she was not seriously accusing Johnson of being complicit in the Kennedy assassination:

&quot;People used to ask me then, &#x27;Do you really think Johnson killed Kennedy?&#x27;&quot; Garson, when she was 65, recalls. &quot;I never took that seriously. I used to say to people, &#x27;If he did, it&#x27;s the least of his crimes.&#x27; It was not what the play was about. The plot was a given.&quot;

&quot;Macbird!&quot; began as a short satirical sketch by Garson, a recent graduate of the anti-Vietnam war movement at University of California, Berkeley. She developed the piece into a full-length play with help from writer/director Roy Levine.

== Productions ==
The play, which opened just three years after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, was controversial. Some believe that authorities pressured theaters in New York City against producing the play. The Village Gate was the only theater willing to defy this pressure. &quot;Macbird!&quot; opened there on February 22, 1967, and closed on January 21, 1968, after 386 performances.

Levine, who worked with Garson to develop the sketch to a full-length play, was the original director of &quot;Macbird!&quot; His bold theatrical vision marked the production throughout the run; near the end of the previews, however, he was replaced by Gerald Freedman. Set design was by Clarke Dunham, costumes were by Jeanne Button, and lights were by Robert Brand. Joel Zwick was the stage manager.

The original cast included:

:Stacy Keach as MacBird
:Rue McClanahan as Lady MacBird
:Paul Hecht as John Ken O&#x27;Dunc
:William Devane as Robert Ken O&#x27;Dunc
:John Pleshette as Ted Ken O&#x27;Dunc
:John Clark as Earl of Warren
:Cleavon Little as Witch 2
:David Spielberg as Crony

The original cast recorded a two-disc album of the script on February 6, 1967. The album was released in a box set, along with a copy of the script, on the Evergreen label (Evergreen - EVR 004).

John Clark left the production early to marry Lynn Redgrave. Cleavon Little made his professional acting debut in the play. The play had a long engagement, with a different cast in Los Angeles, where Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968 while running for the Democratic presidential nomination. &quot;MacBird!&quot; was also produced at the Committee Theater in San Francisco around 1968.

<doc id="475424" wikidata="Q7982025" url="?curid=475424" title="Welsh hat">
<text>The Welsh hat () worn by women as part of Welsh national costume is a tall hat, similar to a top hat, or the capotain. It is still worn by Welsh folk-dance women, and schoolgirls, in Wales on St David&#x27;s Day, but rarely on other occasions.

Two main shapes of Welsh hat were made during the 19th century: those with drum shaped (vertical sided) crowns were worn in north-west Wales, and those with slightly tapering crowns were found in the rest of Wales.

== History ==

The Welsh hat first appeared during the late 1700s; it became widely popular in the 1830s and over 380 examples are known to have survived. The Welsh hat was part of a traditional Welsh costume propagated by Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover (1802–1896) but it is unlikely that she had much influence on anyone other than her friends and servants.

The hat may have developed from a number of types of tall hat including the riding hat, which ladies wore during the early part of the 19th century, (as illustrated in the Llanover prints) but no evidence has been discovered which explains why, during the 1830s, the tall hat with the stiff, flat brim, which is unique to the Welsh hat, replaced the other types of men&#x27;s hat worn by many rural women in Wales at the time.

By the late 1840s the Welsh hat had become an icon of Wales and was used in cartoons to represent Wales as a nation. It brought forward the image of a happy, hearty, healthy, hard-working Welsh woman. It became part of the national identity and was normally worn with the other elements of Welsh costume, especially the gown or bedgown (Welsh: &quot;gŵn&quot; or &quot;betgwn&quot;). It continues in use as an icon of Wales in tourist literature.

By the time Sydney Curnow Vosper painted the iconic Salem in 1908, the hat was no longer fashionable, but Vosper still felt the women he painted should wear the now iconic hats. The hat was so rare by the early 20th century that it is thought Vosper could only find one in the local area, and had to share it amongst the models, painting the same hat into the composition four times.
==Battle of Fishguard==

During the War of the First Coalition, France attempted an invasion of Britain. During the February 1797 Battle of Fishguard, Colonel William Tate an Irish-American commanding French and Irish troops, landed near Fishguard in Wales. English and Welsh militia and civilians under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor hastily assembled to defend the town. When discipline began to break down among Tate&#x27;s troops and their attempted invasion slowed down, Tate asked for surrender terms that would permit his command to leave. Instead of offering terms, Cawdor demanded unconditional surrender. As Tate and his subordinates considered Cawdor&#x27;s demands overnight, Cawdor backed up his bluff with several deceptive measures. According to local lore, these included having women in traditional Welsh costumes and Welsh hats line the cliffs near the French camp. from a distance, the women appeared to be British soldiers in red coats and shakos. Convinced that he was outnumbered, Tate surrendered and his troops were taken prisoner.

== Dating Welsh hats ==
It is difficult to date silk Welsh hats; they were being produced in significant numbers during the 1840s and it is possible that they went out of production only a decade or so later. Unlike other fashionable hats, the Welsh hat may have been worn by its owner for many years and then passed down to succeeding generations. The large numbers of surviving hats implies that they were invested with much more than being just an expensive fashion item.

== Manufacture ==
19th-century Welsh hats were made in the same way and with the same materials as top hats. Most surviving examples were made by Christy&#x27;s of Stockport and London, and Carver and Co of Bristol who also made top hats. Some were made by hat makers in Wales.

The shell was made of buckram (linen fabric), strengthened with shellac or resin and covered with black silk plush (sometimes confusingly known as beaver) but some were made of felt (originally beaver fur, but later fur from other animals). During the 20th century most Welsh hats for adults were made of card covered in black fabric but a few were made of felt especially for Welsh dance teams and women&#x27;s choirs. Welsh hats for children are made of felt and are normally worn with a cotton or lace cap underneath or may have lace attached to the underside of the brim.

== Cockle hat ==
There is an &#x27;alternative&#x27; women&#x27;s hat for those who consider the traditional Welsh hat unflattering, in the form of a &quot;cocklewoman&#x27;s hat&quot;, a flat felt hat tied with ribbons on which women balanced the heavy baskets of cockles which they gathered from the coast around Carmarthen Bay when taking them home to cook, and thence to market.

== Alternative usage ==
A derived meaning of &#x27;Welsh hat&#x27; is an ancillary stack, usually black in colour and slightly conical, attached to the funnel of a ship to ensure cleaner disposal of exhaust from the engines. This arrangement was used in several passenger liners by the Orient Line in the 1950s.

<text>The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) was one of a number of research councils in the United Kingdom. It directed, coordinated and funded research in particle physics and astronomy for the people of the UK. Its head office was at Polaris House in Swindon, Wiltshire, but it also operated three scientific sites: the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC) in Edinburgh, the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING) in La Palma and the Joint Astronomy Centre (JAC) in Hawaii. It published the &quot;Frontiers&quot; magazine three times a year, containing news and highlights of the research and outreach programmes it supports.

The PPARC was formed in April 1994 when the Science and Engineering Research Council was split into several organizations; other products of the split included the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). In April 2007, it merged with the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC) and the nuclear physics portion of the EPSRC to form the new Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

<doc id="475428" wikidata="Q463564" url="?curid=475428" title="Xenophon of Ephesus">
<text>Xenophon of Ephesus (Greek: Ξενοφῶν ὁ Εφέσιος; fl. 2nd century – 3rd century AD) was a Greek writer. His surviving work is the &quot;Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;Ephesiaka&quot; one of the earliest novels as well as one of the sources for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Xenophon was a critic of the philosophy of Stoicism, as reflected in the Ephesiaka.

== Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes ==

The Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes tells the tale of Anthia and Habrocomes, two teenage protagonists living in the city of Ephesus, who fall in love at a festival for Artemis. Unable to confess their love to each other, the two enter a depressive state, until their families, after consulting an oracle who tells them of a troublesome future, arrange for their marriage and for them to be sent to Egypt for their safety. During their journey, the pair are kidnapped by a band of pirates, with members who fall in love with the pair, and are then taken and hidden to be sold into slavery by the chief pirate, Aspyrtos. Habrocomes endures false rape accusations from Aspyrtos&#x27; daughter, who had also fallen in love with him, and faces the punishments that follow, and Anthia is gifted as a slave to a newlywed couple, married to slave named Lampo, and sold to a different slave holder in Anatolia. Aspyrtos discovers that his daughter was in love with Habrocomes, and frees him from his servitude, hiring him to manage his house. Meanwhile, Lampo honors Anthia&#x27;s wishes to remain faithful to Habrocomes, but is then instructed to kill her. Instead, he sells her to seafaring merchants from Cilicia, who shipwreck and are captured by robbers led by Hippothoos, who plans to sacrifice her to Ares. Habrocomes learns that she was sold, and flees to Cilicia to find her. Anthia, along with Hippothoos are ambushed by law enforcement, and are the sole survivors are this conflict, with Anthia being captured by the chief of law enforcement, Perilaos, who falls in love with her, and Hippothoos escaping, only to encounter and befriend Habrocomes. The two leave for Anatolia, where Hippothoos tells Habrocomes his life story, whereupon Habrocomes convinces him to join him in a search for Anthia. Anthia, thinking Habrocomes has died by now, requests a lethal potion to kill herself with. He instead gives her a hypnotic drug, and after the wedding Anthia drinks it. Perilaos mourns what he thinks is her death, only for her to awake after she had been laid to rest. That night, however, a group of bandits rob the tomb, kidnap her, and set sail for Alexandria. 

== Criticisms of Stoicism ==
The Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes was a satirical writing on the philosophy of stoicism, particularly the stoic view on slavery. The two protagonists are believed to be written as stoics, remaining unfazed when presented with distress. The character Habrocomes, realizing that he has fallen in love with Anthia, chastises himself, calling himself &quot; αἰχμάλωτος&quot;, a slave to love. Later, Habrocomes is enslaved, and endures torture. This contrast is written by Xenophon to point out the stoic belief that slavery to passion is worse than legal slavery. 

The Pirate who had kidnapped Habrocomes intended to enter a sexual encounter with the titular character. Habrocomes is then left to deal with his stoic philosophic ideals of accepting fate, and apatheticity towards outside factors enacting on oneself.

<doc id="475435" wikidata="Q2107993" url="?curid=475435" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II. At , it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at the most powerful. First run in 1944, it was the last of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp family, and the culmination of its maker&#x27;s piston engine technology.

The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets, but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56).

Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly displacement, up to Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, first run some seven years earlier (May 1937).

==Design and development==
The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine&#x27;s &quot;corncob&quot; nickname. A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.

The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney&#x27;s new plant near Kansas City, Missouri. The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required. Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest. Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy. Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era.

Engine displacement was , hence the model designation. Initial models developed , and later models . One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered . Engines weighed , giving a power-to-weight ratio of .

Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built.

A derivative engine, the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E, was essentially the R-4360 &quot;cut in half&quot;. It had two rows of seven cylinders each, and was used on the postwar Saab 90 Scandia airliner.

<text>Semey (; ), formerly known as Semipalatinsk ( ) until 2007 and as Alash-Qala ( ) from 1917 to 1920, is a city in eastern Kazakhstan, in the Kazakh part of Siberia. When Abai Region was created in 2022, Semey became its administrative centre. It lies along the Irtysh River near the border with Russia, north of Almaty and southeast of the Russian city of Omsk. Its population is 312,764 (stat.gov.kz).

==History==
The first Russian settlement in the area dates from 1718, when Russia built a fort beside the river Irtysh, near the ruins of an ancient Buddhist monastery, where seven buildings could be seen. The fort (and later the city) was named &quot;Semipalatinsk&quot; (Russian for &quot;Seven-Chambered City&quot;) after the monastery. The fort suffered frequent flooding caused by snowmelt swelling the Irtysh.

In 1778 the fort was relocated upstream to less flood-prone ground. A small city developed around the fort, and largely served the river trade between the nomadic peoples of Central Asia and the growing Russian Empire. The construction of the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the early 20th century added to the city&#x27;s importance, making it a major point of transit between Central Asia and Siberia. On 19 May 1854, Semipalatinsk was designated as the capital of the Semipalatinsk Oblast within the Russian Empire.

Between 1917 and 1920, the city operated as the capital of the largely unrecognized Alash Autonomy, a state (1917–1920) established after the outbreak of the October Revolution in Russia. The city was called Alash-qala during the Alash Autonomy years. Red Army forces loyal to Petrograd took control of the area in 1920. It was the center of the until 17 January 1928, then of the Eastern Kazakhstan Oblast between 17 January 1928 and 14 October 1939 and finally of the Semipalatinsk Oblast between 1939 and 1997.

In 1949 the Soviet atomic bomb programme selected a site on the steppe west of the city as the location for its weapons testing. For decades, Kurchatov (the secret city at the heart of the test range named for Igor Kurchatov, father of the Soviet atomic bomb) was home to many of the brightest stars of Soviet weapons science. The Soviet Union operated the Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS) from the first explosion in 1949 until 1989; 456 nuclear tests, including 340 underground and 116 atmospheric tests, took place there.

Some land around Semey has suffered environmental and health effects from the time of its atomic prosperity: nuclear fallout from the atmospheric tests and uncontrolled exposure of the workers, some of whom lived in the area close to the testsite, have resulted in high rates of cancer, childhood leukemia, and birth defects among the residents of neighbouring villages.

Modern Semey, a bustling university town, has a population exceeding 350,000. Because of its proximity to the Kazakh border with the Russian Federation, and the large scientific community attached to the STS labs and the university, which includes many Russians, Semey is said to have a more Russian character than other cities in Kazakhstan.

Semipalatinsk Oblast merged with the larger East Kazakhstan Region, whose capital city is Oskemen, on 23 May 1997.

The Semey Bridge, a suspension bridge across the Irtish River, connects the two major parts of Semey. It has a main span of and a total length of . Construction began in 1998 and the bridge opened to traffic in November 2000.

In 2007 the Semipalatinsk City Council voted unanimously in favour of changing the name of the city to &quot;Semey&quot;. The Chairman said that existing name had negative associations because of the extensive atomic testing there.

In March 2022, Semey was selected by President Tokayev as the prospective capital of the new Abai Region. This came into force on 8 June 2022 when Abai Region became an official Region of Kazakhstan.

==Climate==

Semey has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and very cold winters. Precipitation is low for the whole year, except for July which has an average of compared to less than in other months. Snow is common, though light, in winter. The lowest temperature on record is , recorded in November 1910, and the highest temperature is , recorded in August 2002.

== Transportation ==

Semey is situated at the Turkestan–Siberia Railway and offers connections to Almaty (former Alma-Ata), Barnaul, and Novosibirsk, among others.

The city has a museum to commemorate Abay Qunanbayuli.

Both a museum and a street are named after Dostoyevsky. The Museum of F. M. Dostoevsky in Semey was opened on 7 May 1971. It was established by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR N 261. Of the seven museums devoted to Dostoevsky, this is the only one located outside Russia.

<doc id="475445" wikidata="Q36386" url="?curid=475445" title="Lothar Matthäus">
<text>Lothar Herbert Matthäus (; born 21 March 1961) is a German football pundit and former professional player and manager. He captained West Germany to victory in the 1990 FIFA World Cup and was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or. In 1991, he was named the first FIFA World Player of the Year, and remains the only German to have received the award. He was also included in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team in 2020.

Matthäus was the first outfield player, and second overall after Antonio Carbajal, to appear at five FIFA World Cups (1982, 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998); he remains one of only six male players to have done so, along with Antonio Carbajal, Rafael Márquez, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Andrés Guardado. He also won UEFA Euro 1980, and played in the 1984, 1988 and 2000 UEFA European Championships. In 1999, aged 38, Matthäus was again voted German Footballer of the Year, having previously won the award in 1990.

Matthäus is the most capped German player of all time, retiring with a total of 150 appearances (83 for West Germany) in 20 years, and 23 goals. Matthäus is a member of the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living football players chosen by Pelé. Diego Maradona said of Matthäus, &quot;He is the best rival I&#x27;ve ever had. I guess that&#x27;s enough to define him.&quot;

A versatile and complete player, Matthäus is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, and was renowned for his perceptive passing, positional sense and well-timed tackling, as well as his powerful shooting. During his career, he usually played as a box-to-box midfielder, although late in his career he played as a sweeper.

Lothar Herbert Matthäus was born on 21 March 1961 in Erlangen, Bavaria, West Germany, to Heinz (1930–2019) and Katharina (1931–2020) Matthäus. His father, who was born in southern Silesia, fled west across the Oder during the Soviet invasion in 1944, then worked as a canteen manager, while his mother worked for Puma. He spent his early playing days in the youth team of 1. FC Herzogenaurach, located in a small town in Bavaria close to Nuremberg.

==Club career==
Matthäus started his professional career in 1979 with Borussia Mönchengladbach of the Bundesliga, for whom he played until 1984. He then played for Bayern Munich from 1984 to 1988, winning the Bundesliga twice and the DFB-Pokal. They also reached the European Cup final in 1987, leading 1–0 for most of the game until two late goals gave FC Porto the win.

Matthäus and Bayern teammate Andreas Brehme signed with Inter Milan of Serie A in 1988, winning the &quot;Scudetto&quot; in 1988–89 during their first season, and the Italian Supercup that year as well. Matthäus continued to enjoy further success with Inter, winning the UEFA Cup in 1991 and being named FIFA World Player of the Year. In the final, he scored a penalty in the first leg to help them to their victory over Roma.

Returning to Bayern Munich in 1992, he won four Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals, another UEFA Cup and reached a second European Cup final in 1999. The only major club football honour which eluded Matthäus, for competitions in which he played, was the UEFA Champions League. Famously, he came within two minutes of picking up a winners&#x27; medal in 1999, only to have his hopes dashed by Manchester United, who scored two last-minute goals in the final, after he was substituted in the 80th minute of play while the team was still leading 1–0. When the two teams went to collect their medals Matthäus removed his runners-up medal immediately after he received it – it was the second time he had been on the losing side in a final under similar circumstances; in the 1987 final, Bayern had been leading 1–0 most of the game until two late goals gave FC Porto the win. After Matthäus retired, Bayern would win the Champions League in 2000–01 and later that year the Intercontinental Cup. His last official match for Bayern took place in Munich on 8 March 2000 and was a Champions League match against Real Madrid, which Bayern won 4–1.

During the 1999–2000 season, Matthäus moved from Bayern to New York City&#x27;s MetroStars team of Major League Soccer in the United States. He played in the US from March to October 2000 and retired from professional football afterwards. During his season with the MetroStars, he traveled to St. Tropez when he was supposed to be rehabbing his back.

Matthäus came out of retirement in 2018, at age 57, to play 50 minutes of 1. FC Herzogenaurach&#x27;s final league game of the season. The team had already secured the league title, and the appearance allowed Matthäus to satisfy his ambition retiring with the club where his career started: &quot;It was always my dream to play my last competitive game here.&quot;

==International career==
===Early international career===
Matthäus was first called up in 1980 to the West German squad that won the UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy, debuting against the Netherlands on 14 June at the tournament. He also played two games at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain; he was brought on as a substitute in group stage games against Chile and the infamous Disgrace of Gijón game versus Austria, which West Germany won 1–0, allowing both teams to advance from their group. West Germany reached the final, losing to Italy at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid 3–1.

Matthäus also had a regular place in the national team for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, scoring the winner in the round of 16 against Morocco. In the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, despite his considerable play-making ability, he was assigned by coach Franz Beckenbauer to mark Argentina&#x27;s Diego Maradona. Maradona did not score in the final, but his pass to Jorge Burruchaga with six minutes left in regulation time set up the winning goal for Argentina, and West Germany lost their second consecutive World Cup final, this time 3–2.

At UEFA Euro 1988 in West Germany, Matthäus captained the team and scored a penalty against eventual champions Netherlands in the semi-final to give his team a 1–0 lead, but Ronald Koeman leveled the score with a penalty, and then Marco van Basten slid in the winning goal in the final minutes.

===1990s===

His immediate success in Italy&#x27;s premier football league, the Serie A, was a precursor to the national team which finally managed to triumph at the 1990 FIFA World Cup held in Italy. Six of West Germany&#x27;s squad played professionally there; Matthäus and the West German squad played most of the World Cup games at Inter&#x27;s home stadium the San Siro. West Germany was the best team of the tournament and one of the few to choose an attacking style of play, contrary to previous German teams&#x27; more defensive style. Matthäus led his squad from midfield and scored four goals, including two in the team&#x27;s opening group match, a 4–1 win against Yugoslavia. He scored the only goal of the quarter-final against Czechoslovakia from a penalty awarded in the 25th minute of the match. West Germany reached its third consecutive final, a rematch against Maradona-led Argentina, and this time Matthäus and his team emerged victorious 1–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome thanks to Andreas Brehme converting an 85th minute penalty. Matthäus later said that playing the World Cup in Italy was &quot;like playing a World Cup at home&quot;. As team captain, Matthäus hoisted the last World Cup trophy before German reunification in 1990.

Matthäus did not participate in the UEFA Euro 1992 in Sweden due to an injury, where a reunified Germany made the final but surprisingly lost 2–0 to Denmark. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup hosted by the United States, he captained the team but now operated as sweeper. He scored a penalty in Germany&#x27;s quarter-final match against Bulgaria at Giants Stadium in New York City, which was also his record-tying 21st World Cup match, but the Bulgarians scored twice in three minutes to upset the defending champions. USA &#x27;94 was expected to be his last tournament, though he did not officially retire from international play. Matthäus was afterwards not called up for the national team, due to feuding with succeeding captain Jürgen Klinsmann and coach Berti Vogts. In his absence Germany won UEFA Euro 1996 which was held in England.

Surprisingly, he was called up for the 1998 World Cup in France as a replacement for the injured Matthias Sammer. He was on the bench for Germany&#x27;s victory over the United States, but came in as a substitute against FR Yugoslavia and helped the team to a 2–2 draw. He became the second player to appear in five different World Cup tournaments, tying the record of Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal. In 2014, the record has also been tied by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who however has only played in four. In 2015, Homare Sawa and Formiga became the first footballers to appear for a record sixth time at the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in Canada. Matthäus played in all the rest of Germany&#x27;s matches until Croatia knocked them out in Lyon 3–0 in the quarterfinals, taking his total to a record 25.

===Final international years===
Matthäus earned his last three caps at UEFA Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands, with his 150th cap being against Portugal, where Germany had a disastrous first round exit. He had a poor performance in the first group game against Romania, causing Oliver Bierhoff and other key German players to demand his benching, but head coach Erich Ribbeck stuck by Matthäus.

==Coaching career==
One year after ending his illustrious playing career, Matthäus went into coaching, an activity where he has, so far, been much less distinguished. In his print interviews and other media appearances, he has been open about his goal and desire to coach in the German Bundesliga. His hope was that taking coaching jobs abroad would lead to offers from German clubs.

When none came his way even after multiple foreign appointments, he often brought it up in the German press in-between his coaching stints. In a lengthy November 2009 &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; interview, Matthäus complained about what he considers to be inadequate treatment he receives in Germany as a former great. He also bemoaned the lack of coaching job offers extended to him in the German Bundesliga—claiming German clubs perceive him as too much of a Bayern supporter and too closely linked with the influential &quot;Bild&quot; tabloid newspaper to give him a job.

===Rapid Wien===

His first head coaching experience was at SK Rapid Wien in the Austrian Bundesliga, lasting from 6 September 2001 until 14 May 2002 with mixed results. Matthäus got Rapid Wien to the second round of the UEFA Cup, Round of 16 in the Austrian Cup, and finished in eighth place in Bundesliga.

===Partizan===
In December 2002, looking to replace their recently sacked head coach Ljubiša Tumbaković, Serbian club FK Partizan hired Matthäus during mid-season winter break, signing the German to an 18-month contract.

Inheriting a team at the top of the league table, Matthäus achieved the immediate goal of steering Partizan to the 2002–03 league title; and did so in convincing fashion, extending the lead over the second-placed cross-town rivals Red Star Belgrade to 19 points at one point.

The German&#x27;s finest hour with the club, however, came in August 2003 when Partizan eliminated Newcastle United in the Champions League third qualifying round to reach the 2003–04 competition&#x27;s group stage. Following the first leg 0–1 loss at home, the cause seemed lost, however, Partizan improbably triumphed 0–1 away at St. James&#x27; Park against the third-placed English Premier League club, taking the tie to penalties. The penalty series brought further dramatic changes of momentum before right back Milivoje Ćirković&#x27;s successful spot-kick in the seventh penalty round finally put Partizan through. Matthäus notably had his back turned to the pitch as couldn&#x27;t bear to watch the drama of Ćirković&#x27;s penalty. Drawn in a tough group with Real Madrid, eventual champions FC Porto, and Olympique de Marseille, Partizan finished last thus missing out on the UEFA Cup spot.

On 13 December 2003, right after finishing the final league match of the first half of the season before the winter break (0–1 win away at FK Železnik), Matthäus abruptly resigned his Partizan post by addressing the players and club leadership in private. A club spokesperson said Matthäus would clear everything up at a press conference scheduled for two days later, but it was already widely speculated through reports in the Hungarian press that the German had agreed terms with the Hungarian Football Federation to coach the Hungary national team. The rumours proved true as he officially signed the contract in Budapest and also got introduced to the media at Kempinski Hotel Corvinus.

Four months after leaving Belgrade, in mid-April 2004, the row over the terms of Matthäus&#x27; contract with Partizan was opened with both parties publicly going back and forth at each other. It began with Matthäus, by now Hungarian national team head coach, giving a detailed interview to Serbian press and accusing Partizan club leadership of breaching the additional terms of his contract. It became known on that occasion that his initial contract with Partizan that had been finalized on 1 January 2003 included a base guaranteed part as well additional premium clauses giving him between 5–10% from players&#x27; transfers and shirt sponsorships as well as Champions League bonus incentives. Matthäus claimed that after none of that was honoured he gave up on asking for his percentages of the Danko Lazović and Zvonimir Vukić transfers as well as Superfund shirt sponsorship deal due to &quot;not wanting to upset the team atmosphere during Champions League qualifying&quot;, but instead pushed for the additional terms to be renegotiated. After successful Champions League qualification, the additional terms were in fact renegotiated with Partizan&#x27;s general secretary Žarko Zečević so that both parties agreed to put the previous additional terms out of effect and instead now give Matthäus 15% of Igor Duljaj&#x27;s (the club&#x27;s best young asset at the time) future transfer abroad as well as to allow Matthäus to leave the club any time he wanted without penalties. Duljaj was sold to Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2004 for US$4 million, and Matthäus claimed Partizan failed to pay him the agreed percentage ($600,000 or €469,500). The club responded two days later in a lengthy press release saying that they don&#x27;t owe him any money. One day after that, Matthäus decided to sue Partizan for the amount of US$600,000 before Sports Arbitration Court in Lausanne, Switzerland.

===Hungary national team===
Matthäus became manager of the Hungary national football team on 14 December 2003. Taking over the national team of a country once synonymous with world class football that had over the decades in the meantime fallen to the point of being unable to qualify for a major competition since the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Matthäus was given the task of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup as part of the Hungarian Football Federation&#x27;s (MLSZ) ambitious plan of returning on the path of former 1950s glory. After being drawn in a tough group with Sweden, Croatia and Bulgaria that goal looked increasingly difficult.

The campaign started in the autumn of 2004 and fairly quickly it became obvious Hungary were in over their heads. Opening 3–0 loss away at Croatia in early September was somewhat offset four days later by a 3–2 hard fought home win versus Iceland. A month later, Matthäus&#x27; Hungary faced another important test away from home, this time at Sweden and once again it finished in disappointment with another demoralizing 3–0 loss. Before the winter break, Hungary managed to beat the minnows of the group Malta thus finishing the autumn part of the qualifying in fourth place with six points, mathematically still within striking distance of the leading trio. Notable was a 2–0 win in a friendly in Kaiserslautern against Germany on 6 June 2004.

As the qualifiers resumed in late March 2005, Hungary hosted Bulgaria in what was pretty much a must win match for Matthäus&#x27; squad, however they only managed a draw right at the end with the goal coming in 90th minute for a 1–1 final scoreline. As Croatia and Sweden both won on the same occasion, the leading duo of teams now tangibly separated themselves from the pack of chasers, all of which meant that in order to qualify Hungary would have to win all its remaining fixtures and even get some outside help in terms of favourable results elsewhere. Such improbable scenario failed to materialize and they ended up in fourth place with 14 points from 10 matches, well behind Croatia and Sweden who earned 25 and 24 points, respectively. However, Matthäus was allowed to finish out the campaign behind the bench, and was even offered Hungarian citizenship, which he at the time said he would accept. There&#x27;s no word whether he actually did. Matthäus left the Hungarian national team on 11 January 2006.

After leaving the Hungary post, Matthäus was vocally critical of the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ), accusing it in November 2007 of &quot;not contributing, but exploiting Hungarian football&quot; before adding that &quot;it is not coincidental that the Hungarian bid to host Euro 2012 didn&#x27;t receive any votes&quot;.

===Atlético Paranaense===
Matthäus signed a one-year contract to coach Brazilian club Atlético Paranaense from the city of Curitiba on 11 January 2006. However, after only seven matches in charge (five wins, two draws) from the start of the 2006 Paraná state championship he quit the club in March 2006 citing the need to be closer to his family. The way he left raised some questions about his professionalism. Apparently, only five weeks after signing a contract he informed club officials about a need to rush back to Europe in order to deal with an urgent personal problem, but assured them he&#x27;d be back in 3–4 days. After missing for two weeks, he faxed in his resignation on 20 March and never even went back to Brazil to pick up his personal belongings. Some ten days later, Atlético put out a release mentioning that Matthäus ran up R$13,000 (US$5,915) in phone charges that the club wanted him to pay. The club even posted the bill on their website.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
On 19 May 2006, only two months following the bizarre Brazilian episode, Matthäus was announced as coach of Red Bull Salzburg (formerly Austria Salzburg) for the upcoming 2006–07 season. Shortly, the club also signed Giovanni Trapattoni (incidentally Matthäus&#x27; former coach at both Inter Milan and Bayern) to be their director of football. In practice, this meant that Trapattoni and Matthäus essentially shared coaching duties.

Despite co-leading the team to the Austrian league title by a large margin, Matthäus would eventually be fired on 12 June 2007 by unanimous decision of the Red Bull Salzburg&#x27;s board of directors.

===Maccabi Netanya===
On 13 April 2008, it was announced that Matthäus signed with Israeli club Maccabi Netanya to coach the team from the beginning of the 2008–09 season.

On 29 April 2009, with the Israeli league season still ongoing and Netanya sitting in fourth place, it was announced that Matthäus will not be back for the second season once the current one is finished. The reason cited was the financial trouble that the club was going through. Matthäus&#x27; club finished the league season in fourth spot.

===Bulgaria national team===

On 23 September 2010, it was announced that Matthäus would be the new coach of the Bulgarian national team after the resignation of Stanimir Stoilov a few weeks earlier. His contract was for one year with the option for a two-year extension.

He started with a 1–0 win against Wales in Cardiff on his debut. Matthäus led Bulgaria to their first win in 2010 and in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. On 12 October 2010, he led Bulgaria to a 2–0 win over Saudi Arabia in a friendly. On 17 November 2010, in a friendly played in Sofia, Bulgaria lost to Serbia 0–1. Despite winning his first match in the qualifiers against Wales, Bulgaria under Matthäus were unable to qualify for Euro 2012, following draws with Switzerland and Montenegro, as well as a home loss against England. On 19 September 2011, it was revealed that Matthäus had been sacked. The match against Switzerland was his final match.

In April 2018, he was one of 77 applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job.

==Columnist and TV pundit==
From 2001 until 2009, in parallel and in-between his coaching jobs, Matthäus wrote a column for the German weekly sports magazine &quot;Sport Bild&quot;.

He also worked as in-studio TV pundit on a variety of television networks during big football competitions: for the German pay television channel Premiere during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, for the German channel ZDF during UEFA Euro 2004, for Eurosport during UEFA Euro 2008, for the Arabian network Al Jazeera Sports during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for the Iranian channel IRIB during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 AFC Asian Cup, and for the British TV network ITV during UEFA Euro 2016. Since the 2012–13 Bundesliga season, he worked as an expert for the Pay TV broadcaster Sky Deutschland.

He has further participated in a special &quot;É Campeão&quot; for the Brazilian channel SporTV.

==Style of play==
Renowned for his positioning, technical ability, stamina, passing, tackling, and powerful long range shooting abilities with either foot, Matthäus is widely considered by many to be one of the greatest and most complete midfielders of all time, and even by some as one of the greatest players of all time. Primarily a box-to-box midfielder, he was also capable of playing as an attacking or defensive midfielder.

Journalist Jacques Thibert, writing for France Football, who awarded Matthäus the 1990 Ballon d&#x27;Or, described him as a player that despite not being sublime in anything individually, was good in every aspect of the game, which allowed him to be at ease in every area of the pitch. Furthermore, Thibert credited his Inter manager Giovanni Trapattoni for turning him into a more creative, assertive and rhythmic player. At Inter under Trapattoni, Matthäus excelled in a three-man midfield, either in a free role as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as an offensive left-sided central midfielder in the &quot;mezzala&quot; role on occasion, with either Gianfranco Matteoli or Sergio Battistini serving as defensive midfielder and Nicola Berti as a box-to-box midfielder.

Well into his 30&#x27;s and coupled with injuries led to then Germany national team manager Berti Vogts&#x27;s decision to convert Matthäus into a sweeper, a position that he would later play at his final five years in Bayern. As a sweeper, Matthäus enjoyed great freedom, as he could defend and make offensive runs into the opposing team&#x27;s defensive area, and also exert influence into Bayern&#x27;s attacking game due to his ability to read the game. Aside from his passing and long range shooting abilities, Matthäus was also an expert free kick and penalty taker, known for his powerful strikes from set pieces. In addition to his footballing skills, Matthäus was also praised for his winning mentality, determination, leadership, and commanding presence on the pitch, which made him a decisive player for his teams.

==Personal life==
Matthäus has four children, and has been married five times. During his first marriage that lasted from 1981 until 1992, wife Silvia gave birth to two daughters Alisa (born 1986) and Viola (born 1988). 

In 1994, he married Swiss model and TV presenter Lolita Morena with whom he had a son, Loris (born 1992). The marriage ended in 1999.

While coaching Partizan in Belgrade, Matthäus met 31-year-old Serbian socialite Marijana Matthäus who became his third wife on 27 November 2003. By late 2007, the couple separated and she filed for divorce. Their divorce became official in late January 2009 following the conclusion of a year-long court case in Salzburg, Austria (their last residence) over the division of assets.

In December 2008, 47-year-old Matthäus married 21-year-old Ukrainian model Kristina Liliana Chudinova. The ceremony was held in Las Vegas. They met a year earlier at the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich. The couple lived in Tel Aviv, Israel, where Liliana studied journalism in a local university;
but started living separately by early 2010.

Matthäus married Anastasia Klimko in 2014 and they have a son. The marriage ended in 2021.

==Media appearances==
Matthäus features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover of the German edition of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;, and features in the &quot;FIFA 14&quot;, &quot;FIFA 15&quot;, &quot;FIFA 16&quot;, &quot;FIFA 17&quot;, &quot;FIFA 18&quot;, &quot;FIFA 19&quot; and &quot;FIFA 20&quot; as an Ultimate Team Icon. Matthäus was also prominently featured in the opening video scene of EA&#x27;s Euro 2000 video game, with Paul Oakenfold transforming the real Matthäus into an interactive digital player he controls in the game with his turntables. In August 2019, Matthäus became the face of turn-based football management game &quot;Football, Tactics &amp; Glory&quot;; he does not actually appear in the game itself.

Matthäus had a guest role together with Joanna Tuczyńska in the television series &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei&quot;, in which he played himself in March 2012. In June 2012, VOX broadcast a documentary titled &quot;Lothar – immer am Ball&quot;.

<doc id="475446" wikidata="Q109888" url="?curid=475446" title="Fedora Project">
<text>The Fedora Project is an independent project to coordinate the development of Fedora Linux, a Linux-based operating system, operating with the mission of creating &quot;an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and containers that enables software developers and community members to build tailored solutions for their users&quot;. 

The project also oversees Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux, a special interest group which maintains the eponymous packages. The project was founded in 2003 as a result of a merger between the Red Hat Linux (RHL) and Fedora Linux projects. It is sponsored by Red Hat primarily, but its employees make up only 35% of project contributors, and most of the over 2,000 contributors are unaffiliated members of the community.

== History ==
The Fedora Project was founded in November 2003 when Red Hat decided to split Red Hat Linux into Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and a community-based operating system, Fedora. Red Hat Professional Workstation was created at this same time.

=== Fedora operating system ===

Fedora Linux, then known as &quot;Fedora Core,&quot; was a fork of RHL launched in 2003. It was introduced as a free-of-cost, community-supported alternative intended for home use, shortly after Red Hat discontinued RHL in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). RHEL branches its releases from versions of Fedora.

Since the release of Fedora 21 in December 2014, three editions have been made available: personal computer, server and cloud computing. This was expanded to five editions for containerization and Internet of Things (IoT) as of the release of Fedora 37 in November 2022. A new version of Fedora Linux is released every six months.

The current release is Fedora 41, which was released on 29 October 2024.

=== Security intrusion ===
In August 2008, several Fedora servers were compromised. Upon investigation it was found that one of the compromised servers was used for signing Fedora update packages. The Fedora Project stated that the attacker(s) did not get the package signing key which could be used to introduce malicious software onto Fedora users&#x27; systems through the update process. Project administrators performed checks on the software and did not find anything to suggest that a Trojan horse had been introduced into the software. As a precaution the project converted to new package signing keys. Fedora published the full details on March 30, 2009.

==Governance==
The Fedora Project is not a separate legal entity or organization; Red Hat retains liability for its actions. The Fedora Council is the top-level community leadership and governance body. The Council is composed of a mix of representatives from different areas of the project, named roles appointed by Red Hat, and a variable number of seats connected to medium-term project goals. The previous governance structure (Fedora Board) comprised five Red Hat appointed members and five community-elected members. Additionally, Fedora Project leader had a veto power over any board decision; in the current model, all voting members can block on issues, with a valid reason. Red Hat at one point announced intentions to create a separate &quot;Fedora Foundation&quot; to govern the project, but after consideration of a variety of issues, canceled it in favor of the board model currently in place.

The community is also involved in organizing lower levels of leadership, both the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo) and the Mindshare Committee (responsible for technical and community oversight, respectively) are community-elected bodies which manage significant portions of the project.

The project facilitates online communication among its developers and community members through public mailing lists and wiki pages. It also coordinates two main events, known as the (FUDCon) and (or Flock to Fedora). FUDCon is a free software event held at different locations in the two designated regions of Latin America and Asia/Pacific. Typically, it revolves around some combination of conferencing, social events, and a hackathon. Flock is a similar event which replaced FUDCon in North America and Europe/the Middle East. Task-specific, flexibly scheduled events known as Fedora Activity Days also gather many project contributors together in various regions.

== Sub-projects ==
=== Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) ===
EPEL is a repository of extra packages published by the Fedora project, which can be expected to work in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux derivatives systems.
EPEL is organised by a Fedora Special Interest Group. EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions. EPEL uses much of the same infrastructure as Fedora, including buildsystem, Bugzilla instance, updates manager, mirror manager and more.

<doc id="475448" wikidata="Q2462163" url="?curid=475448" title="Governor-General of Pakistan">
<text>The governor-general of Pakistan () was the representative of the Pakistani monarch in the Dominion of Pakistan, established by the Indian Independence Act 1947. The office of governor-general was abolished when Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956.

==Constitutional role==

In the first years after its independence, Pakistan was one of the realms of the Commonwealth of Nations that shared the same person as sovereign and head of state. The Pakistani monarch was represented in the dominion by the governor-general of Pakistan, whom the monarch appointed on the advice of the Pakistani government.

The Pakistani monarch and the Federal Legislature of Pakistan constituted the Parliament of Pakistan. All executive powers of Pakistan rested with the sovereign. All laws in Pakistan were enacted only with royal assent, granted by the governor-general on behalf of the sovereign. The governor-general was also responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving the Federal Legislature. The governor-general chose and appointed the Council of Ministers and dismissed them at his discretion. All Pakistani ministers of the Crown held office at the pleasure of the governor-general. The governor-general of Pakistan was also exempted from any proceedings against him in any Pakistani court.

<doc id="475449" wikidata="Q7106411" url="?curid=475449" title="Oscillation (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the oscillation of a function or a sequence is a number that quantifies how much that sequence or function varies between its extreme values as it approaches infinity or a point. As is the case with limits, there are several definitions that put the intuitive concept into a form suitable for a mathematical treatment: oscillation of a sequence of real numbers, oscillation of a real-valued function at a point, and oscillation of a function on an interval (or open set).

==Definitions==

===Oscillation of a sequence===
Let formula_1 be a sequence of real numbers. The oscillation formula_2 of that sequence is defined as the difference (possibly infinite) between the limit superior and limit inferior of formula_1:

:formula_4.

The oscillation is zero if and only if the sequence converges. It is undefined if formula_5 and formula_6 are both equal to +∞ or both equal to −∞, that is, if the sequence tends to +∞ or −∞.

===Oscillation of a function on an open set===
Let formula_7 be a real-valued function of a real variable. The oscillation of formula_7 on an interval formula_9 in its domain is the difference between the supremum and infimum of formula_7:
:formula_11
More generally, if formula_12 is a function on a topological space formula_13 (such as a metric space), then the oscillation of formula_7 on an open set formula_15 is
:formula_16

===Oscillation of a function at a point===
The oscillation of a function formula_7 of a real variable at a point formula_18 is defined as the limit as formula_19 of the oscillation of formula_7 on an formula_21-neighborhood of formula_18:
:formula_23
This is the same as the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the function at formula_18, &quot;provided&quot; the point formula_18 is not excluded from the limits.

More generally, if formula_12 is a real-valued function on a metric space, then the oscillation is
:formula_27

==Examples==

*formula_28 has oscillation ∞ at formula_29 = 0, and oscillation 0 at other finite formula_29 and at −∞ and +∞.
*formula_31 (the topologist&#x27;s sine curve) has oscillation 2 at formula_29 = 0, and 0 elsewhere.
*formula_33 has oscillation 0 at every finite formula_29, and 2 at −∞ and +∞.
*formula_35or 1, −1, 1, −1, 1, −1... has oscillation 2.

In the last example the sequence is periodic, and any sequence that is periodic without being constant will have non-zero oscillation. However, non-zero oscillation does not usually indicate periodicity.

Geometrically, the graph of an oscillating function on the real numbers follows some path in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, without settling into ever-smaller regions. In well-behaved cases the path might look like a loop coming back on itself, that is, periodic behaviour; in the worst cases quite irregular movement covering a whole region.

== Continuity ==
Oscillation can be used to define continuity of a function, and is easily equivalent to the usual &quot;ε&quot;-&quot;δ&quot; definition (in the case of functions defined everywhere on the real line): a function ƒ is continuous at a point &quot;x&quot;0 if and only if the oscillation is zero; in symbols, formula_36 A benefit of this definition is that it &quot;quantifies&quot; discontinuity: the oscillation gives how &quot;much&quot; the function is discontinuous at a point.

For example, in the classification of discontinuities:
* in a &quot;removable discontinuity&quot;, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;
* in a &quot;jump discontinuity&quot;, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value &quot;at&quot; the point lies between these limits from the two sides);
* in an &quot;essential discontinuity&quot;, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.

This definition is useful in descriptive set theory to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than &quot;ε&quot; (hence a Gδ set) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the Lebesgue integrability condition.

The oscillation is equivalent to the &quot;ε&quot;-&quot;δ&quot; definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit (lim sup, lim inf) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given &quot;ε&quot;0 there is no &quot;δ&quot; that satisfies the &quot;ε&quot;-&quot;δ&quot; definition, then the oscillation is at least &quot;ε&quot;0, and conversely if for every &quot;ε&quot; there is a desired &quot;δ,&quot; the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

==Generalizations==
More generally, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is a function from a topological space &quot;X&quot; into a metric space &quot;Y&quot;, then the oscillation of &quot;f&quot; is defined at each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; by

:formula_37

<doc id="475452" wikidata="Q1206676" url="?curid=475452" title="Bob Feller">
<text>Robert William Andrew Feller (November 3, 1918 – December 15, 2010), nicknamed &quot;the Heater from Van Meter&quot;, &quot;Bullet Bob&quot;, and &quot;Rapid Robert&quot;, was an American baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians between 1936 and 1956. In a career spanning 570 games, Feller pitched 3,827 innings and posted a win–loss record of 266–162, with 279 complete games, 44 shutouts, and a 3.25 earned run average (ERA). His career 2,581 strikeouts were third all-time upon his retirement.

A prodigy who bypassed baseball&#x27;s minor leagues, Feller made his debut with the Indians at the age of 17. His career was interrupted by four years of military service (1942–1945) as a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer aboard during World War II. Feller became the first pitcher to win 24 games in a season before the age of 21. He threw no-hitters in 1940, 1946, and 1951, and 12 one-hitters, both records at his retirement. He helped the Indians win a World Series title in 1948 and an American League-record 111 wins and the pennant in 1954. Feller led the American League in wins six times and in strikeouts seven times. In 1946 he recorded 348 strikeouts, the most since 1904 and then believed to be a record.

An eight-time All-Star, Feller was ranked 36th on &quot;Sporting News&quot;″s 1999 list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was named the publication&#x27;s &quot;greatest pitcher of his time&quot;. He was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Baseball Hall of Fame member Ted Williams called Feller &quot;the fastest and best pitcher I ever saw during my career.&quot; Hall of Famer Stan Musial believed he was &quot;probably the greatest pitcher of our era.&quot; He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 in his first year of eligibility, with the then fourth highest percentage of votes. He was elected the inaugural President of the Major League Baseball Players&#x27; Association and both organized and participated in barnstorm exhibition games which featured players from both the Major and Negro leagues. Feller died at the age of 92 in 2010.

==Early life==
Feller played primarily as a shortstop or outfielder, emulating Rogers Hornsby&#x27;s batting stance. From the age of 15, he began to pitch for the Oakviews after a starting pitcher was injured; while doing so, Feller continued to play American Legion baseball. His catcher during this period was Nile Kinnick, who later won the Heisman Trophy in 1939 and became a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.

A student at Van Meter High School, Feller was a starting pitcher for the school&#x27;s baseball team. During this time, he continued to play on the Farmers Union team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season. He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians.

==Professional career==

===Teenage phenomenon (1936–1941)===
In 1936, Feller was signed by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While scouting Feller, Slapnicka said, &quot;This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn&#x27;t go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn&#x27;t know then that he was smart and had the heart of a lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime.&quot; Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester.

Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller&#x27;s contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games, without either playing for a farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball&#x27;s rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts.

After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine, . Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, &quot;For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 [] worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity.&quot;

Feller joined the Indians and made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936, in a relief appearance against the Washington Senators. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the St. Louis Browns. Indians manager Steve O&#x27;Neill had Denny Galehouse warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 strikeouts in earning his first career win. His strikeout total was the highest for a (starting) pitching debut. Three weeks later, he struck out 17 batters, tying a single-game strikeout record previously set by Dizzy Dean, in a win over the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished the season with a 5–3 record, having appeared in 14 games; he had 47 walks and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings. Feller&#x27;s fame reached such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him. His record-setting rookie year made him, according to baseball writer Richard Goldstein, &quot;the best-known young person in America, with the possible exception of Shirley Temple.&quot; Feller&#x27;s entrance to the big leagues was later described:

As the 1937 season began, Feller appeared on the cover of the April 19, 1937 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller&#x27;s season early. &quot;We&#x27;re not taking any chances on that arm and we&#x27;re not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared&quot;, said Slapnicka. On May 18, Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.

On October 2, 1938, Feller was the starting pitcher of a season-ending double-header against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit&#x27;s Hank Greenberg was two home runs short of Babe Ruth&#x27;s then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit&#x27;s Pete Fox and, when he struck out Chet Laabs for the fifth time that day, broke the record, to set the modern major league record of 18. Greenberg went 1–4 with a double, then 3–3 in the nightcap, all singles. He later said of the game, &quot;Feller&#x27;s curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder.&quot; Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. &quot;It was one of those days when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg&#x27;s attempt to break Ruth&#x27;s record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up&quot;, Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts.

In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start, against the Tigers, after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, allowing three hits. On Mother&#x27;s Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller&#x27;s mother; he went on to win the game. Feller finished the 1939 season leading the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (), and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).
Opening Day of the 1940 season featured a no-hitter from Feller against the Chicago White Sox. Feller was assisted by Indians second baseman Ray Mack when he made a diving play to record the final out. This is the only no-hitter to be thrown on Opening Day in major league history. However, he followed his no-hitter with a six-run, three-inning performance in his next start, in a game against the Detroit Tigers. By the end of the season, he had a 27–11 record, with his win total the best in the majors that season, and a career-high for Feller. He accomplished the pitching triple crown for the 1940 season, as he led the AL in ERA (2.61), wins (27) and strikeouts (261) (the latter two led the entire majors). Feller also led the majors with 31 complete games and innings pitched, and won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year Award. Feller later assessed his first few years in the majors: &quot;I relied on the catcher too much. It&#x27;s swell to have a good catcher calling &#x27;em for you, but the pitcher should take responsibility on his own shoulders.&quot;

To publicize Feller&#x27;s extraordinary pitching speed, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball commissioned sports film analysis pioneer and former major leaguer Lew Fonseca to pit Feller&#x27;s fastball against a motorcycle in a &quot;100 mph&quot; speed trial. The test was conducted in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park, with Feller in street shoes, suit pants, dress shirt, and tie, pitching without a mound on an asphalt roadway. He was required to hit a target in diameter from away, &quot;as control is as important as speed&quot;. The still accelerating Harley-Davidson passed Feller going , yet even with a generous head start the ball beat the bike to the target by several feet. Feller&#x27;s throw was calculated at the time to have reached 98.6 mph (158.7 km/h), later raised to 104 mph (167 km/h) using updated measuring methods.

Feller again led the majors in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller&#x27;s pitching ability, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn&#x27;t human.&quot; Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of &quot;Life&quot;, which said: &quot;... he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent every city, town and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as &#x27;Bob&#x27;, and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm.&quot;

===Military service (1941–1945)===
The United States entered World War II with the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while returning from a visit to his terminally ill father at Des Moines to Chicago where he was to sign a new Indians contract. Two days later, he volunteered for the United States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist. Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base and served as a physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father&#x27;s failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions. Feller said, &quot;I told them I wanted to ... get into combat; wanted to do something besides standing around handing out balls and bats and making ball fields out of coral reefs.&quot; Feller was assigned to ; he had hoped to serve on , but it would not be commissioned for another six months after Alabama, joining the fleet February 22, 1943.

Shortly before Feller left for combat, his father died of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later, he married Virginia Winther, whom he had met while in Florida for spring training; she was a student at Rollins College. After the marriage, Feller returned to service as Gun Captain aboard &quot;Alabama&quot; and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the &quot;Alabama&quot; crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Feller&#x27;s first taste of direct combat was at Operation Galvanic in November 1943. &quot;Alabama&quot; also served during Operation Flintlock while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he spent the rest of the war at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station as an instructor.

When the war ended, Feller was discharged as a Chief Petty Officer on August 22, 1945. He was decorated with six campaign ribbons and eight battle stars while serving on missions in both the Pacific and North Atlantic, and was made an honorary member of the Green Berets later in life.

====Baseball during Naval service (1942, 1945)====
Feller pitched for the Norfolk Naval Station&#x27;s Bluejackets baseball team, which went 92–8 in 1942, and later for the Naval Station Great Lakes team.

In 1945, from early spring to late summer, Feller&#x27;s naval duties were again at Great Lakes Naval station, where he replaced Mickey Cochrane as manager of the baseball program, as well as performed as an active pitcher for the team.

===Return to Cleveland (1945–1948)===
Upon arrival in Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the thousand-plus crowd: &quot;The real heroes didn&#x27;t come home.&quot; Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians&#x27; game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits in the game and earned a win in the Indians&#x27; 4–2 victory. &quot;I was so tired from all the receptions I didn&#x27;t know if I could finish the game&quot;, Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50 ERA.

Before the 1946 season, Feller signed a $37,500 () contract for that year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel to play in the Mexican League, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, &quot;The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out.&quot; At one point during the season (as he thought he might be nearing Rube Waddell&#x27;s AL record for strikeouts of 344), Feller claims he confirmed Waddell&#x27;s total with the AL office. In his last appearance of the season he fanned five Detroit Tigers on September 29 to set what was then believed to be the then-AL single-season strikeout record of 348. Later research into box scores for Waddell&#x27;s 1904 pitching appearances credited him with five additional strikeouts, moving the mark to 349 and bumping Feller from the top spot. Feller&#x27;s tally proved the highest for 62 years, until passed by Sandy Koufax&#x27;s then-record 382 in 1965.

During the 1946 season Feller registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42), games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36), and innings pitched ()–– all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, &quot;For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that [player-manager] Boudreau decided I was to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else.&quot;

Feller began 1947 by setting up a barnstorming tour, pitting his own selected team against a Negro league baseball team led by Satchel Paige. Feller&#x27;s team included Stan Musial and Phil Rizzuto, while Paige&#x27;s included Buck O&#x27;Neil and Hilton Smith. They played in 22 games across the United States, and at the conclusion of the tour, each player had made nearly as much money as the St. Louis Cardinals made as a team for their 1946 World Series win. Against the St. Louis Browns, in Feller&#x27;s second start of the season, he extended his major league record for one-hitters when he recorded his ninth one-hit game in a shutout win on April 22. In a June 13 game against the Philadelphia Athletics, having already amassed 10 strikeouts through four innings, Feller fell from the mound, which rain had made slippery, and injured his back. &quot;My fastball was never the same after that&quot;, Feller said. He ended the season as the AL leader in wins (20) and shutouts (5), and led the majors in strikeouts (196) and innings pitched (299).

===World Series champion (1948)===

In 1948, the Indians had one of their finest seasons, though Feller experienced a season that had a considerable number of downs as well as ups. Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh time in his career in the 1948 All-Star Game, but declined to play, feeling that his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point he was winless for a month, and by July 22, his record was 9–12. Lou Boudreau, the Indians&#x27; player-manager, declared &quot;we sink or swim with Feller&quot;, and continued to pick him. Feller proceeded to go 10–3 for the remainder of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19–15, a league-leading 164 strikeouts, and a 3.56 ERA. The Indians won a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox to determine the team to represent the AL in the World Series; it was the first time the team had won the pennant since the 1920 season.

Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series against the NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau appeared to have picked off the Braves&#x27; Phil Masi as he attempted to steal a base, but umpire Bill Stewart ruled he was safe. Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1–0. Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. Feller said, &quot;Stewart was the only guy in the park who thought he was safe.&quot; Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance record; the 86,288 fans at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at a baseball game. The Braves put up three runs in the top of the first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh inning, the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, Feller said, &quot;This is as good as being President.&quot;

===Later years (1949–1956)===
After taking a pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his shoulder and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed during the rest of the season, and he finished the year with a 15–14 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, &quot;He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday.&quot; In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.

On July 1, 1951, Feller recorded his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. &quot;I was depending on my slider and I didn&#x27;t begin to think of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in the back of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time&quot;, Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. The Cleveland starting rotation was so strong that future Hall of Famer Bob Lemon&#x27;s 17 wins was the only time in an eight-year stretch he &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; win 20.

Feller went 22–8 in 1951, leading the AL both in wins and with a .733 win percentage. He was named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Pitcher of the Year.

Feller started the 1952 season with three wins in his first five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also allowed only one hit. Feller struggled for the rest of the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager Al López shut Feller down for the season, finishing 9–13 and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular-season games during 1954, breaking an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.

The Indians played against the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, getting swept in four games. Unlike the 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. Indians manager Al López said of not starting Feller, &quot;I know Feller wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about it ... If we had won the first or second game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn&#x27;t (win either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn&#x27;t the Feller he&#x27;d been (earlier in his career).&quot; In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He went 4–4 in 25 appearances. During the off-season, he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with National League representative Robin Roberts throughout the off-season, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Major League Baseball Players&#x27; Association.

In the 1956 season, Feller started four games and appeared in 15 others, and finished with an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97 ERA. The Indians held &quot;Bob Feller Night&quot; on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;: &quot;I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time.&quot; Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or a job with the Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, &quot;We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there will always be a job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization.&quot; On December 28, Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, &quot;I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years.&quot; He continued, &quot;What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would have to come to the decision I am making now, some time.&quot;
He spent his entire career of 18 seasons with the Indians, being one of &quot;The Big Four&quot; in the Indians&#x27; pitching rotation in the 1950s, along with Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia. Feller shares the Major League record of 12 one-hitters with Nolan Ryan, and was the first pitcher to win 20 or more games before the age of 21. He ended his career with 266 wins, 2,581 strikeouts and 279 complete games. Over the course of his career, he led the AL in strikeouts seven times and walks four times. Upon his retirement, Feller was number three all-time in strikeouts, behind only Walter Johnson and Cy Young, and held the major league record for most walks in a career (1,764), and holds the 20th-century record for most walks in a season (208 in 1938). The Indians retired his jersey number, 19, on December 27, 1956.

As a hitter, Feller posted a .151 batting average (193-for-1282) with 99 runs, 28 doubles, 13 triples, 8 home runs, 99 RBI and 100 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .963 fielding percentage.

In 1962, Feller was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, along with Jackie Robinson. Both were the first to be elected on their first ballot appearance since the original induction class of 1936. At the time of his induction, only Ty Cobb (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and Honus Wagner (95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller&#x27;s candid assessment of Robinson as a ballplayer. &quot;They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He was a good baserunner. He was a fair hitter. He was an average second baseman. He was not as good a ballplayer as Larry Doby. There were a lot of better black ballplayers than Jackie Robinson,&quot; said Feller.

==Dispute with Commissioner Chandler==
Throughout his career, Feller played exhibition games during the off-season, playing in towns unaccustomed to seeing major league ballplayers. His exhibition tours often featured other big leaguers and Negro league players, like Satchel Paige, who was also a teammate of Feller&#x27;s with the Indians. Other players included Stan Musial, Mickey Vernon, and Jeff Heath. During a barnstorming tour in 1945, Feller pitched against Jackie Robinson after he had been signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He told a reporter in Los Angeles that he believed Robinson was too muscle-bound to succeed against pitching in the major leagues, although Robinson recorded two hits off Feller. Players had to notify the Commissioner of Baseball, A.B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, before participating in exhibition games and were not allowed to begin games before the conclusion of the major-league season. Feller wrote to Chandler, challenging the league&#x27;s limit on the number of games that were allowed to be played and proposing an increase; the Commissioner agreed to Feller&#x27;s proposal. To minimize travel time, Feller employed airplanes, such as two Douglas DC-3s in 1947, to transport players from town to town. Feller&#x27;s involvement, as well as that of other major league players, was the subject of meetings between the Commissioner and AL and NL presidents.

In 1947, Feller announced that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major-leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players&#x27; pension fund: &quot;I want to prove I&#x27;m not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession&quot;. Feller also believed it was &quot;grossly unfair&quot; that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, &quot;I have no comment on Bob&#x27;s outside activities. I don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;ve hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they&#x27;ve hurt him.&quot;

Feller&#x27;s barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details made him one of the wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on $125,000 or more in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller&#x27;s biographer John Sickels suggested: &quot;They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren&#x27;t necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro league players were just as good as the Major League players.&quot;

==Records==
Feller, who averaged over 25 wins for the three seasons preceding his military service and won 26 his first year out, estimated that the nearly four years he missed while in the U.S. Navy cost him at least 100 career wins. Given his proven performance on both sides of his hitch it is likely that Feller would have finished his career with more than 350 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. The always plain-speaking Feller said, &quot;I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400 than 300 if I hadn&#x27;t spent four seasons in the Navy. But don&#x27;t take that as a complaint. I&#x27;m happy I got home in one piece.&quot;

There are numerous claims of how fast Feller could actually throw a ball. All are inherently dubious (due to the extremely inaccurate means of measuring used), and none can be proven valid. Best estimates are at least 98 mph and quite possibly several miles an hour over 100 mph. Among them is footage of a Feller fastball being clocked by Army ordnance equipment (used to measure artillery shell velocity) and registering at . With primitive equipment, Feller was at one point measured at . Feller once mentioned that he was clocked at at Lincoln Park in Chicago. He also is credited with throwing the second fastest pitch ever officially recorded, at , in a game in 1946 at Griffith Stadium. Feller said a 1974 test involving Nolan Ryan would be evaluated when he threw the ball rather than when it reached home plate, and as columnist Milton Richman wrote, Feller said &quot;Sandy Koufax had the best live fast ball he ever saw.&quot;

Although subjective, an extremely telling assessment of just how hard Feller was to hit – even for a left-handed hitter, who had an advantage compared to right-handers – was the tribute from Ted Williams, regarded by many as the greatest hitter in baseball history. He confessed, &quot;Three days before he pitched I would start thinking about Robert Feller, Bob Feller. I&#x27;d sit in my room thinking about him all the time. God I loved it ... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I&#x27;d think about him for three days.&quot; Feller was ranked 36th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication&#x27;s &quot;greatest pitcher of his time&quot; as well as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Each year, American Legion Baseball presents the &quot;Bob Feller Pitching Award&quot; to the pitcher &quot;with the most strikeouts in regional and national competition.&quot;

==Later life==

Feller was elected the inaugural president of the Major League Baseball Players&#x27; Association in 1956. As president, he appeared before Congress to speak about baseball&#x27;s reserve clause. Feller was the first player to get a franchise to agree to a share of game receipts when he was the starting pitcher for Indians&#x27; games. He was also the earliest player to incorporate himself (as Ro-Fel, Inc.). He was also one of the first players to work for the right of a player to enter free agency.

Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, had three sons, Steve, Martin, and Bruce. The couple divorced in 1971; from the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller had built. Virginia died on May 6, 1981, in her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. In retirement, Feller lived with his second wife, Anne (née Thorpe), in Gates Mills, a suburb of Cleveland.

Feller is credited with being the first baseball star to sign autographs at baseball memorabilia conventions, and was such a frequent guest at such events that one ESPN writer speculated that he had signed more autographs than any other person.

In 1990, Feller received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In June 2009, at the age of 90, Feller was one of the starting pitchers at the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame Classic, which replaced the Hall of Fame Game at Cooperstown, New York. Feller was treated for leukemia in August 2010. By October, Feller was fitted with a pacemaker and was diagnosed with pneumonia and thrush, an infection of the mucous membrane lining the mouth and throat. He was transferred on December 8 from the Cleveland Clinic to hospice care. On December 15, Feller died of complications from leukemia at 92.

==Legacy==
Of Feller&#x27;s death, Mike Hegan, Indians broadcaster and son of former Feller teammate and battery mate Jim Hegan, stated, &quot;The Indians of the 40s and 50s were the face of the city of Cleveland and Bob was the face of the Indians. But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70 years. You will likely not see that kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again.&quot; In 2010, the &quot;Cleveland Indians Man of the Year Award&quot; was renamed the &quot;Bob Feller Man of the Year Award&quot;.

On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller&#x27;s widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players&#x27; uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller&#x27;s pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the press-box seat that Feller used in later life.

The Bob Feller Museum opened in Feller&#x27;s birthplace, Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller&#x27;s son Stephen, on land donated by Brenton Banks, the museum had two rooms that contained Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the Upper Deck sports card company for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat. Following Feller&#x27;s death in 2010, the museum faced serious funding issues. In 2015, with family approval, the Bob Feller Museum was donated to the city of Van Meter for use as the city hall. Some artifacts remain on permanent exhibit and can be viewed free of charge.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award was created to honor the life of Feller. The award recognizes &quot;individuals that possess the values, integrity, and dedication to serving our country that Bob Feller himself displayed.&quot;

<text>The term culture industry () was coined by the critical theorists Theodor Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter &quot;The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception&quot;, of the book &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947), wherein they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—films, radio programmes, magazines, etc.—that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity. Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the mass communications media, renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their economic circumstances are. The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer perceived mass-produced culture as especially dangerous compared to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts. In contrast, true psychological needs are freedom, creativity, and genuine happiness, which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by Herbert Marcuse.

==The Frankfurt School==

Members of The Frankfurt School were much influenced by the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of Karl Marx, as well as the revisitation of the dialectical idealism of Hegel; both events are studied not in isolation, but as part of the process of change. As a group later joined by Jürgen Habermas, they were responsible for the formulation of critical theory. In works such as &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; and &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;, Adorno and Horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of mass culture has a political implication, namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single &quot;culture industry&quot; whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the &quot;masses&quot; to market interests.

==The theory==
The essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the extortionate nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system. Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art. The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now-defunct sources of culture.

Horkheimer and Adorno make consistent comparisons between Fascist Germany and the American film industry. They highlight the presence of mass-produced culture, created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive, homogenised audience in both systems. This illustrates the logic of domination in post-enlightenment modern society, by monopoly capitalism or the nation state. Horkheimer and Adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that &#x27;integrates its consumers from above&#x27;, arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order, the holistic power of the individual is undermined.

==Influences==
Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s work was influenced by both the broader socio-political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists. Written in California in the early 1940s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically Jewish, German émigrés, &quot;The Culture Industry&quot; is influenced by European politics and the war by which the continent was consumed. Simultaneously, the American film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation, it was &quot;Hollywood at its most classical, American mass culture at its most Fordist&quot;.

Horkheimer and Adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social, political and economic theory, most notably:

* Karl Marx&#x27;s theories of alienation and commodity fetishism,
* Max Weber&#x27;s rationality, which shaped the concept of instrumental reason, and 
* Georg Lukacs&#x27; concept of the reification of consciousness.

==Elements==

Anything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions. There will also be a use value: the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility. Yet, the modern soap operas with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass-produced cultural product. 

Only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value, e.g. &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), starring George C. Scott as the eponymous American general, was released at a time of considerable anti-war sentiment. The opening shot is of Patton in front of an American flag making an impassioned speech. This was a form of dialectic in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely (the thesis) or ironically (the antithesis) and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film. However, the film is manipulating specific historical events, not only as entertainment, but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities. Given that the subtext was instrumental and not &quot;value-free&quot;, ethical and philosophical considerations arise.

Normally, only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries, but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight. A film like &quot;Patton&quot; is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which, according to Adorno, is regressing into a cultural blandness. To Hegel, order is good &quot;a priori&quot;, i.e. it does not have to answer to those living under it. Marx&#x27;s theory of Historical Materialism was teleological, i.e. society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism. But Adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the &quot;status quo&quot;.

==Mass culture==
A center point of the &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; is the topic of &quot;the Enlightenment as Mass Deception.&quot; The term &quot;culture industry&quot; is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture, the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to &quot;authentic culture.&quot;

Horkheimer and Adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them. The culture industry delivers the &quot;goods&quot; so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them. Through mass production, everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities. Everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what&#x27;s best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible. Psychological drives become stoked to the point where sublimation is no longer possible.

Movies serve as an example. &quot;All films have become similar in their basic form. They are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible. Even fantasy films, which claim to not reflect such reality, don&#x27;t really live up to what they claim to be. No matter how unusual they strive to be, the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas. Also, for example, erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible.&quot;

The aims of the culture industry are—as in every industry—economic in nature.

Authentic culture, however, is not goal-oriented, but is an end in itself. Authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities, but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought. Authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such. Authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre-formed schemas.

As for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry, Horkheimer and Adorno contend that it arises from companies&#x27; pursuit of the maximization of profit, in the economic sense. However, this cannot be said to be culture, or what culture is supposed to be. It can only be described as being a form of commerce, just like any other kind of commerce.

The culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn &quot;mass media&quot; and their consumers. 
However, for Adorno, the term &quot;culture industry&quot; does not refer to &quot;mass culture&quot;, or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses. On the contrary, such involvement of the masses is only apparent, or a type of seeming democratic participation. Adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of &quot;defrauding of the masses&quot;. Horkheimer and Adorno deliberately chose the term &quot;culture industry&quot; instead of &quot;mass culture&quot; or &quot;mass media&quot;. &quot;The culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises.&quot; The culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity: &quot;Amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism.&quot; Horkheimer and Adorno, above all, in their critical analyses, delve into what they call &quot;the fraying of art&quot; and the &quot;de-artification of art&quot;, and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry. Works of art have become commodified: Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement. According to Critical Theory, &quot;selling out&quot; is not the decisive factor involved, but rather it&#x27;s the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue.

&quot;Culture today is infecting everything with sameness.&quot; For Adorno and Horkheimer, subversion has become no longer possible.

==Observations==

Wiggershaus states: &quot;The other side of Adorno&#x27;s apparently paradoxical definition was ignored: that rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art, in any significant sense, only as a product of subjectivity&quot;. This would deny Adorno contemporary political significance, arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought. He also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore Adorno&#x27;s work which, in part, stems from Adorno&#x27;s inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories.

Adorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing Marxism. Whereas he accepted the classical Marxist analysis of society, showing how one class exercises domination over another, he deviated from Marx in his failure to use dialectics as a method to propose ways to change. Marx&#x27;s theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class, but Adorno and Horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement. 
Adorno&#x27;s idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over. 

Adorno&#x27;s work is still of interest. Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2014, music critic Alex Ross argued that Adorno&#x27;s work has a renewed importance in the digital age: &quot;The pop hegemony is all but complete, its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons...Culture appears more monolithic than ever, with a few gigantic corporations—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon—presiding over unprecedented monopolies.&quot;

Scholar Jack Zipes, influenced by Adorno, critiqued the mass commercialization and corporate hegemony behind the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise. He argued that the commodities of the culture industry are &quot;popular&quot; because they are homogenous and obey standard conventions; the media then influences the tastes of children. In his analysis of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;″s global brand, Zipes wrote, &quot;It must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general. To be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what makes up a phenomenon&quot;. 

Inspired by Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s work, scholars have also identified new industrial phenomenon. This includes &quot;prolonged adaptation,&quot; meaning the practice of repeatedly adapting the same film, television and theater content to &quot;inordinately prolong the commercial life&quot; of ideas.

<text>Lloyd Robertson (born January 19, 1934) is a Canadian journalist and former news anchor who is special correspondent on CTV&#x27;s weekly magazine series, &quot;W5&quot;. Robertson served as the chief anchor and senior editor of CTV&#x27;s national evening newscast, &quot;CTV News with Lloyd Robertson,&quot; from 1984 to 2011, when he retired from the &quot;CTV National News&quot; team. He co-hosted &quot;W5&quot; from 2011 to 2016.

Robertson has covered many major events throughout his career, including the 1967 opening of Expo 67 in Montreal, the 1969 Moon landing (along with Percy Saltzman), many Olympic Games, Terry Fox&#x27;s Marathon of Hope, the patriation of the Constitution of Canada, both the 1980 Quebec referendum and the 1995 Quebec referendum on separation from Canada, many federal elections, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the power outage crisis on both sides of the border of August 14, 2003.

On the scene, he has covered the construction of the Berlin Wall, the deaths of four former Canadian prime ministers, the elections of nearly half of Canada&#x27;s prime ministers, state funerals, and royal, papal, and U.S. presidential visits. His name was also the basis for the satirical news anchor character Floyd Robertson, portrayed by Joe Flaherty on the Canadian TV comedy series &quot;SCTV&quot;.

==Early life==
Robertson was born in Stratford, Ontario, the son of Lillie Francis and George Henderson Robertson. His father had eight children with his first wife; after she died, he remarried and had two sons, Gordon and Lloyd; Lloyd was the youngest child. Robertson&#x27;s father worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway, while his mother was a homemaker. His father was of Scottish descent, while his mother emigrated from England.

Robertson had a somewhat rough childhood; his mother suffered from mental-health problems which eventually resulted in her undergoing a prefrontal lobotomy, while his father, who was 60 at the time of Robertson&#x27;s birth, frequently battled cancer and died when Robertson was 21. During his childhood, Robertson was also frequently cared for by his half-siblings, especially his twin siblings Irvin and Ethel.

He first became interested in broadcasting when he was 12 years old, watching soldiers from The Perth Regiment marching home from World War II, and heard the commentators from CJCS talking about it. According to Robertson, &quot;I realized I was in the centre of something very important...something much bigger than myself.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==

===Radio===
Robertson started his broadcasting career in 1952 at CJCS radio. He started working after school on Saturdays as an operator, spinning 78 rpm records, and read the news at midnight before he signed off.

Robertson completed high school and continued to work at CJCS until he moved to CJOY in Guelph in 1954.

===CBC===
On the advice of one of his colleagues in Guelph, he auditioned to work at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). After his audition was over, Robertson thought, &quot;I&#x27;m never going to see this building again.&quot; Despite this, he got hired by the CBC, thanks to his bass voice.

Robertson applied for CBWT-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1956, his first-ever TV job. He mostly did local television until December 25, 1956, which was his first national broadcast.

After four years in Winnipeg, Robertson auditioned for CBOT-TV in Ottawa, Ontario. After two years, he moved to Toronto to host &quot;CBC Weekend&quot; in the late 1960s, and later anchor of &quot;The National&quot; from 1970 to 1976, before joining the CTV Television Network in October that year. One of the reasons he left the CBC was his frustration at union regulations which confined news anchors to the role of announcer — prohibiting them from writing their own scripts or participating in editorial decisions concerning the news broadcast.

===CTV===
From 1976 to 1984, Robertson co-anchored the &quot;CTV National News&quot; with Harvey Kirck. When Kirck retired from the anchor desk in 1984, Robertson became the senior news anchor for CTV. Since 2004, Robertson has also served as one of the hosts of CTV&#x27;s current affairs program &quot;W5&quot;, alternating with CTV&#x27;s lead weekend anchor Sandie Rinaldo.

Robertson&#x27;s signature sign-off of each news broadcast is, &quot;And that&#x27;s the kind of day it&#x27;s been.&quot;

In February 2010, Robertson denied rumours of his impending retirement as a &quot;work of fiction&quot; during an appearance on Vancouver talk radio station CKNW. However, on the &quot;CTV National News&quot; broadcast of July 8, 2010, Robertson officially announced he would be leaving the anchor chair in the latter half of 2011 (although he did not say a specific date at the time, his last newscast was later announced to air on September 1, 2011). He has stated that he will continue on in various capacities at the network and in public life including being host of &quot;W5&quot;.

On September 1, 2011, after 41 years as a national news anchor at both the CBC and CTV, Robertson anchored &quot;CTV News&quot; for the last time. The newscast concluded with him reminiscing about the stories he covered, such as natural disasters and royal weddings, while calling his news anchor run a rare privilege to have &quot;a front row seat to history.&quot; He also thanked his audience watching and supporting him over the years.

In 2020, he narrated a portion of the 8th Canadian Screen Awards.

==Personal life==

Robertson married his high school sweetheart, Nancy Barrett, in July 1956. They have four daughters (Lisa, Nanci, Susan, and Lynda) and seven grandchildren.

On March 29, 2018, Robertson was involved in a multi-vehicle collision on the Don Valley Parkway. He was uninjured.

==TV longevity records==
Robertson outlasted Kirck, the late Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Bob Schieffer, Tom Brokaw, and the late Peter Jennings to become the longest-serving network news anchor in television history; he is also one of the longest-serving news anchors on English-language North American television (network or local) along with KTRK-TV (Houston)&#x27;s Dave Ward, WNBC (New York)&#x27;s Chuck Scarborough, WPVI (Philadelphia)&#x27;s Jim Gardner, and KING-TV (Seattle)&#x27;s Jean Enersen.

Robertson, who was 77 years old at the time of his retirement from the CTV News team, also holds the record of being the oldest TV news anchor in network television and the oldest news anchor in Canada.

<doc id="475462" wikidata="Q289729" url="?curid=475462" title="Rie Miyazawa">
<text>is a Japanese actress and former idol singer. She is regarded as one of Japan&#x27;s top actresses, and her accolades include six Japan Academy Film Prizes and three Kinema Junpo Awards.

Miyazawa began her career as a child model, seeing wide exposure as the original face of Mitsui Rehouse, and made her acting debut in the 1988 film &quot;Seven Day&#x27;s War&quot;, for which she won the Japan Academy Award for Newcomer of the Year at age 16. Her short-lived music career began with the single &quot;Dream Rush&quot; in 1989, and the next year she performed at the prestigious &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; television special.

Miyazawa quickly rose to prominence as one of the top idols of the early Heisei period, attracting controversy for her 1991 nude photography book &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, which moved 1.5 million copies. Her personal struggles were further scrutinized, including a high-profile engagement to sumo wrestler Takanohana, a suicide attempt and battle with anorexia nervosa. By 1996, she went into hiatus and briefly resettled in the United States.

She took on a few television drama roles in the late 1990s, and returned to the big screen in the Taiwanese films &quot;The Cabbie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Peony Pavilion&quot; (2001). She co-starred in the highly-acclaimed 2002 film &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot;, which marked a full-fledged comeback for Miyazawa and remains as her most recognizable role both domestically and internationally. She saw further success in &quot;The Face of Jizo&quot; and &quot;Tony Takitani&quot; (2004), and received several accolades for &quot;Pale Moon&quot; (2014) and &quot;Her Love Boils Bathwater&quot; (2016).

== Life and career ==
Miyazawa was born in Tokyo to a Dutch father and a Japanese mother. Since her debut at age 11 in an advertisement for Kit Kat, she has appeared many films, television shows, commercials, stage appearances and photo books to her credit. She starred in the children&#x27;s comedy &quot;Bokura no Nanokakan Sensō&quot; (&quot;Seven Days&#x27; War&quot;) and &quot;Tokyo Elevator Girl&quot;. Miyazawa made her debut as a singer on September 15, 1989, with her album &quot;MU&quot;.

Miyazawa gained notoriety in 1991 with the publication of a fine art nude photography book, &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, and even more publicity in 1992 with her engagement to sumo star Takanohana. The engagement was called off in 1993. In September 1994 she cut her wrists with a broken glass in what she described as an &quot;accident&quot;. The tabloids focused on Miyazawa&#x27;s drinking session, fights with her mother, and her escape to a nearby hotel as signs of a suicide attempt. Miyazawa continued to pursue her career as an actress, including a performance in Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s movie &quot;47 Ronin&quot; that year. But the following February she pulled out of the drama &quot;Kura&quot; and in November backed out of the musical &quot;Kyote&quot;.

In early 1996 Miyazawa moved to Coastal California, but by May she was back on TV reporting from the Cannes Film Festival and later that year she appeared in two TV dramas: &quot;Hanayome Kaizoebito&quot; and &quot;Kyosokyoku&quot;. In 1997 she made &quot;Mikeneko Homes (tasogare) Hoteru&quot; and also appeared on stage.

In 2001, Miyazawa won the Best Actress Award at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival by portraying a Chinese Kunqu performer in the Hong Kong film Peony Pavilion, directed by Yonfan. Then in 2002, she starred alongside Hiroyuki Sanada in &quot;Tasogare Seibei&quot; (&quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot;), the year&#x27;s hit movie that won numerous awards at home, including ones for the lead actors, and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Foreign Language Film. In 2003 she played the role of Oshino in the NHK TV series &quot;Musashi&quot;.

&quot;Tony Takitani&quot; (2004) — an adaptation of a short story by the bestselling author Haruki Murakami — received critical acclaim, with Miyazawa playing two roles alongside Issey Ogata. The film, which was entered at the Sundance Film Festival, has been described as &quot;a perfectly controlled minimalist film masterpiece&quot;. In 2005, she starred as Tsubaki in &quot;Ashurajō no Hitomi&quot; (あしゅらじょう の ひとみ), which is a movie adaptation of a 16th-century play.

Most recently, Miyazawa received the 40th Japan Academy Prize for Best Actress for her performance in Her Love Boils Bathwater.

==Personal life==
On February 13, 2009, Miyazawa announced to the public that she was six months pregnant and would soon marry the father of the child who is reported to be Hiroyuki Nakatsu, an ex-pro surfer from Hawaii turned entrepreneur. On May 20, 2009, in Tokyo she gave birth to a baby girl.

On March 23, 2016, Miyazawa announced that her divorce from Nakatsu has been finalized.

On March 16, 2018, she married Go Morita from the band V6.

<doc id="475469" wikidata="Q4862194" url="?curid=475469" title="Baron Braybrooke">
<text>Baron Braybrooke, of Braybrooke in the County of Northampton, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1788 for John Griffin, 4th Baron Howard de Walden, with remainder to his kinsman Richard Neville-Aldworth. Lord Howard de Walden was the son of William Whitwell and Anne Griffin, daughter of James Griffin, 2nd Baron Griffin of Braybrooke, who was the son of Edward Griffin, 1st Baron Griffin of Braybrooke, and his wife Lady Essex Howard, eldest daughter of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk and 3rd Baron Howard de Walden.

In 1749 Whitwell assumed the surname of Griffin, and the same year he was elected to Parliament for Andover, a seat he held until 1784. The latter year the barony of Howard de Walden, which had been in abeyance since the death of his great-great-grandfather the third Earl of Suffolk in 1689, was called out of abeyance in favour of him, and he was summoned to the House of Lords as the fourth Baron Howard de Walden. Moreover, the barony of Griffin of Braybrooke held by his maternal ancestors had become extinct on the death of his uncle, the third Baron, in 1743. In 1788 the Braybrooke title was revived when Griffin was created Baron Braybrooke.

==History==

On Lord Braybrooke and Howard de Walden&#x27;s death in 1797, the barony of Howard de Walden again fell into abeyance (it was called out of abeyance in 1799; see the Baron Howard de Walden). He was succeeded in the barony of Braybrooke according to the special remainder by his kinsman Richard Neville-Aldworth, the second Baron. He also inherited the family seat of Audley End in Essex, to add to his own at Billingbear Park in Berkshire. The same year he succeeded in the barony, Neville-Aldworth assumed by act of Parliament, (38 Geo. 3. c. &quot;8&quot; ), the surname of Griffin for himself, his eldest son and one of his daughters (one of his younger sons was George Neville-Grenville, Dean of Windsor). He had previously represented Grampound, Buckingham and Reading in Parliament and later served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. Lord Braybrooke was the husband of Catherine Grenville, daughter of the former Prime Minister George Grenville.

Their eldest son, the third Baron, sat in the House of Commons as a representative for Thirsk, Saltash, Buckingham and Berkshire.

Latimer Neville, 6th Baron Braybrooke was Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge for over 50 years from 1853–1904 but was described as &quot;a good but dull man lacking intellectual powers.&quot;

Lieutenant Richard, 8th Baron Braybroke, Grenadier Guards, was killed on active service in Tunisia on 23 January 1943, and is buried in the Medjez el Bab Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery.

The tenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1990, served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex from 1992 to 2000. Lord Braybrooke was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Essex in July 2000. Lord Braybrooke had eight daughters but no sons.

In 2017, the title was inherited by the tenth Baron&#x27;s fourth cousin once removed, Richard Neville, born in 1977. The eleventh Baron is a great-great-great-grandson of George Neville-Grenville, Dean of Windsor, third son of the second Baron.

The family seat of Billingbear House burnt down in 1924. In 1948, Audley End house (but not the estate and contents) was sold, while creating the incorporeal hereditament right to repurchase, to the Ministry of Works and later came into the care of English Heritage. 

The Barons Braybrooke remain the hereditary visitors of Magdalene College, Cambridge but no longer have the power to appoint the master. Following an amendment to the college statutes, approved in 2012, the master is now appointed by the governing body of the college.

<doc id="475472" wikidata="Q737426" url="?curid=475472" title="Phasianus">
<text>The &quot;typical&quot; pheasant genus Phasianus in the family Phasianidae consists of two species. The genus name is Latin for pheasant.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Phasianus&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is Latin for &quot;pheasant&quot;. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek φἀσιἀνος, &quot;phāsiānos&quot;, meaning &quot;(bird) of the Phasis&quot;. The birds were found by the Argonauts on the banks of the River Phasis (now the Rioni) in Colchis on the east coast of the Black Sea (now western Georgia). The type species of the genus is the common pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;).

===Species===
The genus contains just two species.
The common pheasant (&quot;P. colchicus&quot;) has about 30 recognised subspecies forming five or six distinct groups; one is only found on the island of Taiwan off the southern coast of continental China, and the rest on the Asian mainland, reaching west to the Caucasus. Some subspecies have been introduced to Europe, North America and elsewhere, where they have hybridized and become well established.

The green pheasant (&quot;P. versicolor&quot;) is a species from Japan that which the fossil record suggest diverged about 2.0–1.8 million years ago from &quot;P. colchicus&quot;.

Fossil remains of a &quot;Phasianus&quot; pheasant have been found in Late Miocene rocks in China. Additionally, fossil material belonging to a new species of &quot;Phasianus&quot; was described in 2020 as &quot;P. bulgaricus&quot;. The fossils were recovered from Miocene (Turolian) strata in Bulgaria. Thus, like many other phasianid genera, this lineage dates back more than 5,000,000 years.

==Sexual selection==
&quot;Phasianus&quot; pheasants are a harem polygynous species that are a highly sexually dimorphic genus, where males are large and elaborately ornamented with brightly coloured plumage, ear tufts, wattles, spurs, and long tails, compared to females that are non-ornamented with a dull cryptic plumage. They have a polygynous mating system that is based upon males defending mating territories during breeding season in the early spring to control access to females with higher quality resources and defence against predation. Females are free to move between different male territories, allowing them to benefit from direct or indirect benefits by choosing high quality mates and areas with better resources for their offspring. &quot;Phasianus&quot; chicks are precocial so males provide no parental care for their young.

A male&#x27;s ornaments and weaponry are a symbol of status that allow females and rivals to examine a male&#x27;s fitness and fighting ability. During breeding season, males court females or challenge other males by enlarging their sexual traits, sloping their body towards their opponent or mate while spreading their tail and plumage, inflating the wattle and raising their ear tufts. Older males usually have more exaggerated ornaments and weaponry than younger males, and are more likely to mate and control larger territories. Submissive or juvenile males will conceal their wattle display from bigger males, reducing their chance of mating but minimizing their risk of injury by avoiding physical conflict with a more dominant male. The general brightness of the plumage may also be used to identify healthy males from unhealthy males. Only in cases where males exhibit similar characteristics, do males attack one another.

To display these traits throughout breeding season entails a physiological cost, leading to an endurance rivalry between males, where only males that can afford to display these breeding rituals will pass on their genes to their offspring. An example of this can be seen in the length of a male&#x27;s spur and the wattle display that is enlarged during sexual displays; both are considered costly as they are highly dependent on nutrition and testosterone levels. Females generally prefer brighter wattles and longer spurs. The brightness in the wattle comes from storing a carotenoid pigment known as astaxanthin in their diet that is inhibited by an infestation of parasites. Only healthy individuals in good physical condition can afford to fully express bigger and brighter wattles, which may also be associated with disease resistance. Spurs function not only as weapons in combat between males but also as an important cue in female choice as the length of the spur signifies the male&#x27;s phenotypic condition (age, weight, size) and viability. Studies have found that longer spurs resulted in bigger harem sizes compared to males with shorter spurs.

Females will benefit from choosing males with higher expressed ornaments, as her offspring will also inherit these genes, increasing their survival and chance for reproduction (sexy son hypothesis).

<text>Sarov () is a closed town in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia. It was known as Gorkiy-130 (Горький-130) and Arzamas-16 (), after a (somewhat) nearby town of Arzamas, from 1946 to 1991. Until 1995, it was known as Kremlyov/Kremlev/Kremljov (). The town is closed as it is the Russian center for nuclear research. Population: 92,047 (2010 Census); 87,652 (2002 Census)

==History==


The history of the town can be divided into two different periods. In the earlier history of Russia it was known as one of the holy places of the Russian Orthodox Church, because of its monastery, that gave Russia one of its greatest saints, St. Seraphim. Since the 1940s, it has gradually become the center for research and production of Soviet and later Russian nuclear weapons.

The history of human settlement in the area around Sarov goes back at least to the 12th–13th centuries, when a large Mordvin settlement was founded on its spot. In 1298, the town was taken over by Tatars.

The modern town took its name from being the site of the Sarov Monastery next to the Sarov River. In 1664, an Orthodox monk Theodosius first settled on the Sarov hill. The first Church of Sarov tenement was founded in 1706. Saint Seraphim was living in Sarov from 1778 to 1833. In 1903, the monastery was visited by Tsar Nicholas II and other members of the royal family. At that time the monastery had nine churches, including one underground. Around 320 monks lived in the monastery.

In 1923 the monastery was closed, and the monks were executed by the Bolsheviks. During World War II, the monastery buildings were used as factories for producing rockets for BM-13 &quot;Katyusha&quot; rocket launchers.

In 1946, the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics—a nuclear weapons design facility that would become known in the West under the acronym &quot;VNIIEF&quot;—was built. Sarov became a closed city. It was removed from all unclassified maps. Initial provisional names included Base 112, Site 550, Yasnogorsk, Kremlyev and Arzamas-75. Sarov was known as Arzamas-16 until 1995. In 1954, Arzamas-16 was granted town status.

The town is home to the Russian Federation Nuclear Center and &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; museum which has a number of casings of Soviet-era nuclear weapons and photographs of those involved in their production. The main access is by train, which, after a security stop and inspection, is allowed into the town to disembark passengers. The small Sarov Airport is generally for government aircraft only, and visitors usually fly to Nizhny Novgorod airport and then drive.

The town is surrounded by fences patrolled by the military. Foreigners, and even Russians who do not live in Sarov, are not allowed to enter the town without permission. Foreigners who visit on business must surrender their passports, phones, and cameras to security while they are in the facility, though some documentary filmmakers have shot footage inside the town walls.

A large portion of the town is located on the grounds of the P.G.S. State Park in adjacent Temnikovsky District of the Republic of Mordovia.

In 1993, the town became a sister city to Los Alamos, New Mexico, the home of the U.S. nuclear weapons design laboratory (Los Alamos National Laboratory, or LANL). Scientists from LANL and VNIIEF have cooperated on various arms control and nuclear safeguards programs, under which the Los Alamos scientists learned, to their amusement, that their Russian colleagues paid homage to their American rivals by irreverently calling their own laboratory &quot;Los Arzamas.&quot;

Boris Yeltsin changed the town&#x27;s name back to Sarov at the request of the residents in August 1995.

On June 17, 1997, a Russian Federal Nuclear Center senior researcher Alexandr Zakharov received a fatal dose of 4850 rem in a criticality accident.

Today the Russian federal nuclear center is responsible for important decisions concerning the development, production, storage, and utilization of nuclear weapons; the recycling of radioactive and other materials; and research in fundamental and applied physics. International foundations have helped to fund some research scientists in Sarov following the downsizing and transitions after the Soviet era. The city&#x27;s fences and the electrified fences around fissile stores are maintained. In 1998 a resident stated that the perimeter fences also kept the city free from organized crime.

During the 2010 Russian wildfires the Russian Army took preventive forest fire measures and radioactive material was reported to have been secured elsewhere.

On Monday August 12, 2019, flags in Sarov were lowered to half-staff during the viewing of five coffins in Sarov&#x27;s main square. These were the bodies of five Rosatom workers who were killed during the August 8, 2019, Nyonoksa radiation accident near Severodvinsk at the State Central Navy Testing Range which is the main rocket launching site of the Russian Navy. Later on August 12, 2019, the bodies of the Rosatom workers, who were involved in the development and testing of the 9M730 Burevestnik (Petrel) also known as by the NATO reporting name SSC-X-9 &quot;Skyfall&quot;, were buried in Sarov&#x27;s main cemetery.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the town of oblast significance of Sarov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Sarov is incorporated as Sarov Urban Okrug.

<text>The flag of The Gambia is the national flag of The Gambia. It consists of three horizontal red, blue and green bands separated by two thin white lines. Adopted in 1965 to replace the British Blue Ensign defaced with the arms of the Gambia Colony and Protectorate, it has been the flag of the Republic of the Gambia since the country gained independence that year. It remained unchanged throughout the Gambia&#x27;s seven-year confederation with Senegal.

==History==
The British first arrived in what is now modern-day Gambia in 1661, when they conquered James Island. They proceeded to construct forts around the confluence of the Gambia River with the Atlantic Ocean, and gradually expanded their control upstream. This area became a protectorate in the 1820s under the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone, and eventually emerged as a separate crown colony of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire in 1888. This newfound status gave the Gambia its own &quot;distinctive&quot; colonial flag. This is because colonies were permitted to utilize the British Blue Ensign and deface it with the arms of the territory under the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865. The arms of the Gambia at the time consisted of a circle depicting an elephant, a palm tree and hills, along with the letter &quot;G&quot; standing for the first letter of the territory&#x27;s name.

The Gambia was granted self-governance in 1963. The defaced blue ensign continued to be used until full independence was granted in 1965. The winning design for the new flag was created by Louis Thomasi, who worked as an accountant. It is one of the few African flags that does not utilize the colours of the country&#x27;s leading political party, since its design &quot;has no political basis&quot;. It was first hoisted at midnight on February 18, 1965, the day the Gambia became an independent country. In 1982, the Gambia formed a confederation with Senegal, which lasted for seven years before its dissolution in 1989. However, this closer union did not result in change of national symbols, and the Gambian flag continued to be flown during this time.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue alludes to the Gambia River, which is the nation&#x27;s key geographical feature and from which the country derives its name. The red evokes the sun – given the Gambia&#x27;s close proximity to the Equator – as well as the savanna, while the thin white stripes represent &quot;unity and peace&quot;. The green epitomizes the forest and the agricultural goods that the Gambian people are heavily dependent on, both for exports and their personal use.

===Similarities===
The flag&#x27;s colour scheme of red, blue, green and white is the same as the one featured on the coat of arms of the Gambia.

===Construction sheet===
==Governmental flags==
==Other uses==
Following the 2013 general election in Luxembourg, a three-party coalition between the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP), the Democratic Party (DP) and The Greens was formed. It was labelled a &quot;Gambia coalition&quot;, because the colours of the three political parties are identical to the ones on the flag of the Gambia – red (LSAP), blue (DP) and Green (The Greens).

==Military flags and ensigns==
Military flags and ensigns of the Gambia are following British practice but different from British military flags and ensigns.

<text>Baron Bolton, of Bolton Castle in the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1797 for the Tory politician Thomas Orde-Powlett, who had previously served as Chief Secretary for Ireland. Born Thomas Orde, he was the husband of Jean Mary Browne-Powlett, illegitimate daughter of Charles Powlett, 5th Duke of Bolton, who had entailed the greater part of his extensive estates to her in default of male issue of his younger brother Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton.

John Orde, younger brother of the first Baron Bolton, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and was created a baronet, of Morpeth in the County of Northumberland, in 1790.

The sixth Duke died without male heirs in 1794 when the dukedom became extinct and the Bolton estates passed to Thomas Orde in right of his wife. In 1795 he assumed the additional surname of Powlett. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He briefly represented Yarmouth in the House of Commons. On his death the title passed to his nephew, the third Baron. His grandson, the fifth Baron, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Richmond and served as Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire.

The eighth Baron was an amateur jockey and pilot, who led aid convoys providing humanitarian relief to Bosnian Muslims during the Bosnian War. He later became custodian of Bolton Castle, successfully raising funds for its restoration.

In 2023, the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, Thomas Peter Algar [Orde-Powlett], 9th Baron Bolton, who succeeded his father in June 2023.

<doc id="475482" wikidata="Q729671" url="?curid=475482" title="Branded to Kill">
<text>is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film directed by Seijun Suzuki and starring Joe Shishido, Koji Nanbara, Annu Mari and Mariko Ogawa. The story follows contract killer Goro Hanada as he is recruited by a mysterious woman named Misako for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he is hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his life and sanity.

&quot;Branded to Kill&quot; was designated by its production company and distributor, Nikkatsu, as a low-budget B movie. Dissatisfied with the original script, the studio called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct the film shortly prior to the start of production. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas for the project the night before or on the set while filming, and welcomed ideas from his colleagues; the screenplay is credited to Hachiro Guryu, a writing collective that consisted of Suzuki and seven other writers, including his frequent collaborators Takeo Kimura and Atsushi Yamatoya. Suzuki gave the film a satirical, anarchic and visually eclectic bent, which the studio had previously warned him away from. The brief turnaround Suzuki was given to make &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; meant that post-production on the film was completed only a day before its pre-scheduled release on June 15, 1967.

The initial critical and commercial failure of &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; prompted Nikkatsu to ostensibly fire Suzuki for making &quot;movies that make no sense and no money&quot;. In response, Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu, and garnered support from student groups, like-minded filmmakers and the general public, causing a major controversy throughout the Japanese film industry. Suzuki was blacklisted and did not make another feature film for a decade, but became a countercultural icon.

By the 1980s, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; had gained a strong international cult following; film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Woo, Park Chan-wook, Quentin Tarantino and Nicolas Winding Refn, and composer John Zorn. &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; inspired a loose 1973 &quot;Roman Porno&quot; remake directed by Yamatoya, &quot;&quot;, and a loose 2001 sequel, &quot;Pistol Opera&quot;, directed by Suzuki for Nikkatsu. The company has also hosted two major retrospectives spotlighting his career.

==Plot==
Goro Hanada, the Japanese underworld&#x27;s third-ranked hitman, and his wife, Mami, fly into Tokyo and are met by Kasuga, a former hitman-turned-taxi driver. Hanada agrees to help Kasuga return to the underworld, and the three go to a club owned by yakuza boss Michihiko Yabuhara. The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to Nagano. After the meeting, Yabuhara seduces Mami.

Driving their client towards his destination, Hanada spots an ambush and dispatches several gunmen. Panicking, Kasuga attacks one of the ambushers, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, resulting in both of their deaths. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh&#x27;s car but hears three gunshots. Rushing back, he finds the client safe, while three additional ambushers have been shot through their foreheads. At another ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire; the client shoots Sakura dead. On his way home, Hanada&#x27;s car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, gives him a ride. At home, Hanada has rough sex with Mami, fuelled by his fetish for smelling boiling rice.

Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill a customs officer, an ocularist and a jeweller. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard&#x27;s animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second through a pipe drain when he leans over a sink, and blasts his way into the third&#x27;s office, escaping on an advertising balloon. Misako then offers him a near-impossible contract to kill a foreigner. During the job, a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle, causing him to miss the target and kill a bystander. Misako tells Hanada that he will lose his rank and be killed. Preparing to leave Japan, he is shot by Mami, who sets fire to their apartment and flees. Hanada escapes, his belt buckle having stopped the bullet.

Reunited, Hanada and Misako alternate between failed attempts by him to seduce her and then to kill each other; she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, Hanada realizes he loves Misako and is unable to kill her. Confused, he wanders the streets and passes out. The next day, he finds Mami at Yabuhara&#x27;s club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara&#x27;s diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet through his forehead.

Hanada returns to Misako&#x27;s apartment, where a projected film shows her bound and tortured, and directs him to a breakwater, where he will be killed the following day. Hanada submits to the demand, but kills the assassins instead. The former client arrives, revealing himself to be the legendary Number One Killer. He intends to kill Hanada but, in thanks for his work, allows him a truce. As Hanada holes up in Misako&#x27;s apartment, Number One taunts him with threatening phone calls and forbids him to leave the apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now-exhausted Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day, but disappears during the meal.

At the apartment, Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One, stating he will be waiting at a gymnasium with Misako. Hanada arrives at the gym, but Number One does not show. As Hanada prepares to leave, a tape recording explains that Number One exhausts his targets before killing them. Tying a headband across his forehead, Hanada climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire; Number One manages to shoot him several times before dying. As Hanada triumphantly declares himself the new Number One, Misako enters the gym. Hanada instinctively shoots her dead, again declares himself Number One, then falls out of the ring.

==Cast==
* Joe Shishido as Goro Hanada, the Number Three Killer: a hitman with a fetish for the smell of boiling rice. He is gainfully employed by the yakuza until a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle during a &quot;Devil&#x27;s job&quot;. He misses his target and is marked for death—then descends into a world of alcohol and paranoia. Shishido has been called the face of Suzuki&#x27;s films, owing in part to their frequent collaborations, this being among the most prominent. After middling success in Nikkatsu melodramas he underwent plastic surgery, enlarging his cheeks several sizes. He returned to tremendous success as a heavy and, soon thereafter, a star.
* Koji Nanbara as the Number One Killer: the legendary hitman whose existence remains a subject of debate. Incognito, he employs the yakuza to provide bodyguards. Later, he reappears with the intention of killing Hanada, first trapping him in an apartment, then moving in with him, before their final showdown in a public gymnasium.
* Isao Tamagawa as Michihiko Yabuhara: the yakuza boss that hires Hanada and seduces his wife. Upon the discovery that his diamond smuggling operation has been burgled, he employs Hanada to execute the guilty parties then adds him to the list when he flubs the job. His final appearance is with a bullet hole in his head.
* Annu Mari as Misako Nakajo: the femme fatale with a penchant for dead butterflies and birds. She picks Hanada up in her open top convertible when his car breaks down in the rain. Under Yabuhara&#x27;s direction she enlists him to kill a foreigner. She attempts to kill Hanada but falls in love with him, which instigates her capture and use as bait by Number One. Mari has said she was experiencing suicidal urges at the time she first read the script and the character captivated her. &quot;I loved her name, but it was her first line &#x27;My dream is to die&#x27; that had a profound impact on me. It was like lightning.&quot;
* Mariko Ogawa as Mami Hanada: Hanada&#x27;s wife who has a predilection towards walking around the house nude. Shortly after meeting Yabuhara she enters an affair with him. When her husband&#x27;s career sours she attempts mariticide and flees—to be confronted later at Yabuhara&#x27;s club. This was Mariko Ogawa&#x27;s only film appearance.
* Hiroshi Minami as Gihei Kasuga: formerly a ranked hitman who lost his nerve and took to drinking. After introducing Hanada to Yabuhara he joins the former in a dangerous chauffeur mission. His nerves get the better of him and he experiences a short-lived mental breakdown.

==Production==
Nikkatsu conceived &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; as a low-budget hitman film, a subgenre of the studio&#x27;s yakuza-oriented movies. Their standard B movie shooting schedule was applied, one week for pre-production, 25 days to shoot and three days for post-production. The budget was set at approximately yen. Shortly before filming began, with the release date already set, the script was deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; by the head office and contract director Seijun Suzuki was brought in to do a rewrite. Studio head Kyūsaku Hori told Suzuki he had had to read it twice before he understood it. Suzuki suggested they drop the script but was ordered to proceed. The rewrite was done with his frequent collaborator Takeo Kimura and six assistant directors, including Atsushi Yamatoya (who also played Killer Number Four). The eight men had worked under the joint pen name Hachiro Guryu (&quot;Group of Eight&quot;) since the mid-1960s. Nikkatsu was building leading man Joe Shishido into a star and assigned him to the film. They specified that the script was to be written with this aim. The film also marks Shishido&#x27;s first nude scene. Suzuki originally wanted Kiwako Taichi, a new talent from the famous theatre troupe Bungakuza, for the female lead but she took a part in another film. Instead, Suzuki selected Annu Mari, another new actress who had been working in Nikkatsu&#x27;s music halls. In casting the role of Hanada&#x27;s wife, Suzuki selected Mariko Ogawa from outside of the studio as none of the contract actresses would do nude scenes.

Suzuki did not use storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He preferred to come up with ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know what is going to happen is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer&#x27;s rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially &quot;Japanese&quot; killer, &quot;If he were Italian, he&#x27;d get turned on by macaroni, right?&quot; Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went &quot;off track&quot;. For nude scenes the actors wore &quot;maebari&quot;, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki&#x27;s method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.

==Themes and style==
Like many of its yakuza film contemporaries, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; shows the influence of the James Bond films and film noir, though the film&#x27;s conventional genre basis was combined with satire, kabuki stylistics and a pop art aesthetic. It was further set apart from its peers, and Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s previous films, through its gothic sensibilities, unusual atonal score and what artist and academic Philip Brophy called a &quot;heightened otherness&quot;. The result has been alternately ascribed as a work of surrealism, absurdism, the avant garde and included in the Japanese New Wave movement, though not through any stated intention of its director. Suzuki employed a wide variety of techniques and claimed his singular focus was to make the film as entertaining as possible.

Genre conventions are satirized and mocked throughout the film. In American noirs, heroes, or anti-heroes, typically strive to be the best in their field. Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players. The femme fatale—a noir staple—Misako, does not simply entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself. She tries to kill him, wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things. Hanada&#x27;s libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period, such as James Bond, though perversely exaggerated. Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada&#x27;s boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond&#x27;s &quot;shaken, not stirred&quot; martini order. The film also deviates from the opening killer-for-hire scenario to touch on such varied subgenres as psychosexual romance, American Gothic thriller and &quot;Odd Couple&quot; slapstick.

The film industry is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese censorship often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film&#x27;s design. In the story, after Hanada finds he is unable to kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki&#x27;s relationship with studio president Kyūsaku Hori. He compared Hanada&#x27;s antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One&#x27;s sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a &quot;top professional.&quot;

The film was shot in black and white Nikkatsuscope (synonymous with CinemaScope at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio). Due to the wide frame, moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and chiaroscuro imagery to create excitement and suspense. Conventional framing and film grammar were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration. In editing, Suzuki frequently abandoned continuity, favouring abstract jumps in time and space as he found it made the film more interesting. Critic David Chute suggested that Suzuki&#x27;s stylistics had intensified—in seeming congruence with the studio&#x27;s demands that he conform:

==Reception==
&quot;Branded to Kill&quot; was released to Japanese theatres on June 15, 1967, on a double bill with Shōgorō Nishimura&#x27;s &quot;Burning Nature&quot;. The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics. &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; magazine reported that the films &quot;resulted in less than viewers at Asakusa and Shinjuku and about 500 at Yurakucho on the second day.&quot; Both Shishido and Yamatoya later recounted having seen &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; in practically empty theatres, the latter on its opening night. Iijima Kōichi, a critic for the film journal &quot;Eiga Geijutsu&quot;, wrote that &quot;the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex. The man wants to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice. We cannot help being confused. We do not go to theaters to be puzzled.&quot; Nikkatsu had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences, a specialty of Suzuki, whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s. This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori. On April 25, 1968, Suzuki received a telephone call from a company secretary informing him that he would not be receiving his salary that month. Two of Suzuki&#x27;s friends met with Hori the next day and were told, &quot;Suzuki&#x27;s films were incomprehensible, that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies.&quot;

A student film society run by Kazuko Kawakita, the Cineclub Study Group, was planning to include &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; in a retrospective honouring Suzuki&#x27;s works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation. With support from the Cineclub, similar student groups, fellow filmmakers and the general public—which included the picketing of the company&#x27;s Hibiya offices and the formation of the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee—Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal. During the three-and-a-half-year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light. He had been made into a scapegoat for the company&#x27;s dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company-wide restructuring. A settlement was reached on December 24, 1971, in the amount of one million yen, a fraction of his original claim, as well as a public apology from Hori. In a separate agreement &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; and his previous film, &quot;Fighting Elegy&quot;, were donated to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Film Centre. The events turned Suzuki into a legend and shook the film world. &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;, along with other of his films, played to &quot;packed audiences who wildly applauded&quot; at all-night revivals in and around Tokyo. However, Suzuki was blacklisted by the major studios and did not make another feature film until &quot;A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness&quot; (1977) ten years after &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;. In the meantime, he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays.

&quot;Branded to Kill&quot; first reached international audiences in the 1980s, featuring in various film festivals and retrospectives dedicated wholly or partially to Suzuki, which was followed by home video releases in the late 1990s. It garnered a reputation as one of his most unconventional, revered Nikkatsu films and an international cult classic. It has been declared a masterpiece by the likes of film critic Chuck Stephens, writer and musician Chris D., composer John Zorn and film director Quentin Tarantino. Writer and critic Tony Rayns noted, &quot;Suzuki mocks everything from the clichés of yakuza fiction to the conventions of Japanese censorship in this extraordinary thriller, which rivals Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Lady from Shanghai&quot; in its harsh eroticism, not to mention its visual fireworks.&quot; Modified comparisons to the films of a &quot;gonzo Sam Fuller&quot;, or Jean-Luc Godard, assuming one &quot;factor[s] out Godard&#x27;s politics and self-consciousness&quot;, are not uncommon. In a 1992 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine article, film director Jim Jarmusch affectionately recommended it as, &quot;Probably the strangest and most perverse &#x27;hit man&#x27; story in cinema.&quot; Jasper Sharp of the Midnight Eye wrote, &quot;It is a bloody marvellous looking film and arguably the pinnacle of the director&#x27;s strikingly eclectic style.&quot;

However, the workings of the plot remain elusive to most. Sharp digressed, &quot;To be honest it isn&#x27;t the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki&#x27;s unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge.&quot; As Zorn has put it, &quot;plot and narrative devices take a back seat to mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images.&quot; Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, &quot;An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. The script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake.&quot; David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, &quot;If you consider the movie soberly, it&#x27;s hard to deny the bosses had a point.&quot; On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented &quot;Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it&#x27;s hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this.&quot;

After another unrelated 10-year hiatus, Suzuki and Nikkatsu reunited for the &quot;Style to Kill&quot; retrospective, held in April, 2001, at Theatre Shinjuku in Tokyo. It featured 28 films by Suzuki, including &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;. Suzuki appeared at the gala opening with star Annu Mari. Joe Shishido appeared for a talk session at an all-night, four-film screening. An accompanying &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; visual directory was published. The following year, the Tanomi Company produced a limited edition 1/6 scale &quot;Joe the Ace&quot; action figure based on Shishido&#x27;s character in the film, complete with a miniature rice cooker. In 2006, Nikkatsu celebrated the 50th anniversary of Suzuki&#x27;s directorial debut by hosting the Seijun Suzuki 48 Film Challenge retrospective at the 19th Tokyo International Film Festival. It showcased all of his films. He and Mari were again in attendance.
==Legacy==
As one of Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s most influential films, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; has been acknowledged as a source of inspiration by such internationally renowned directors as Hong Kong&#x27;s John Woo, South Korea&#x27;s Park Chan-wook and America&#x27;s Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino. Jarmusch listed it as his favourite hitman film, alongside &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (also 1967), and thanked Suzuki in the screen credits of his own hitman film &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot; (1999). Most notably, Jarmusch mirrored a scene in which the protagonist kills a target by shooting up from a basement through a sink drain. He went so far as to screen the film for Suzuki when the two met in Tokyo. Critics have noted &quot;Branded to Kill&#x27;s&quot; influence on the films of Wong Kar-wai, such as his hitman film &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1995), as well as Johnnie To&#x27;s &quot;Fulltime Killer&quot; (2001). However, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; was most influential in its native Japan. The film&#x27;s premise, in which hitmen try to kill each other in competition for the Number One rank, is spoofed in films such as Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s &quot;Getting Any?&quot; (1995) and Sabu&#x27;s &quot;Postman Blues&quot; (1997), which features a character named Hitman Joe. &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; played a role in the development of the long-running &quot;Lupin III&quot; franchise. It also had a profound impact, through Suzuki&#x27;s firing and the resulting student uprising, in the beginnings of the movement film, usually underground or anti-establishment films which focused on issues of import to audiences, as opposed to production line genre pictures.

===Associated films===
Prior to the release of &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;, Suzuki and the other members of Hachiro Guryu began developing a stand-alone sequel to the film, tentatively titled . The story would have concerned Noda (set to have been played by Shishido), an unranked member of the assassin&#x27;s guild Hanada belongs to, being tasked by a woman named Ruiko with killing her husband, a formerly-ranked killer who has since disgraced the organization. Noda would have soon discovered that he and Ruiko&#x27;s husband share similar killing methods, as both would leave their victims with eerie grins upon their deaths. According to Yamatoya, &quot;Branded to Kill Continued&quot; would have &quot;crank[ed] up&quot; the surrealist qualities of the original film, and given meaning to the &quot;Branded&quot; of the film&#x27;s title (with the grins on Noda&#x27;s victims acting as his &quot;brand&quot;); the film&#x27;s climax would have taken place on an abandoned island and depicted a shootout against a computer. A full script for &quot;Branded to Kill Continued&quot; was never written due to the original film&#x27;s initial failure.

In 1973, Nikkatsu released &quot;, which has been described as a &quot;Roman Porno&quot; reimagining&quot; of &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;, as both tell the story of a contract killer forced to lie low after botching an assignment. Directed by Yamatoya from a script by fellow Hachiro Guryu member Yōzō Tanaka, the film was produced independently of Nikkatsu (in contrast to other &quot;Roman Porno&quot; films) by Genjiro Arato, who also played the lead role of Hoshi and would later produce the three films comprising Suzuki&#x27;s Taishō Roman Trilogy, &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; (1980), &quot;Kagero-za&quot; (1981) and &quot;Yumeji&quot; (1991). Sharp has described &quot;Trapped in Lust&quot; as &quot;a brilliant testament to the fact that, rather than mere cheap exploitation, the adult film genre was regarded as liberating, daring and anti-authoritarian, and that interesting and intelligent things could be realised with it&quot;. He also notes its reflection of the &quot;gumi&quot; system of the Japanese film industry (whereby a single director frequently works with the same pool of collaborators), as the film was made by Suzuki&#x27;s recurring colleagues and thus bears elements of Suzuki&#x27;s style despite his lack of involvement.

Thirty-four years after the original release of &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;, Suzuki directed &quot;Pistol Opera&quot; (2001), a loose sequel co-produced by Shochiku and filmed at Nikkatsu. The character Goro Hanada returns as a mentor figure to the new Number Three, played by Makiko Esumi. However, Joe Shishido was replaced by Mikijiro Hira in the role of Hanada. Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film&#x27;s producer, Satoru Ogura, wanted Hira for the role. Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor. Jonathan Rosenbaum supposed, &quot;Can I call a film a masterpiece without being sure that I understand it? I think so ...&quot; Although some, such as Elvis Mitchell for The Village Voice, felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original.

==Home video==
&quot;Branded to Kill&quot; was initially made available in Japan by Nikkatsu in VHS format, first on February 10, 1987, then a second version on June 10, 1994. Both versions were censored for nudity with a black bar obscuring half of the frame during the relevant scenes. The first uncensored release since the film&#x27;s theatrical debut was an October 26, 2001, DVD from Nikkatsu. It included an interview with Seijun Suzuki, two with Joe Shishido, an Annu Mari photo gallery and the original film trailers for it and several other Suzuki films. The release was one of three linked to the &quot;Style to Kill&quot; theatrical retrospective. In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Suzuki&#x27;s directorial debut, the film was included in the first of two six-film DVD box sets which was released October 1, 2006. All six titles included audio commentary tracks featuring Suzuki with various collaborators, those being Annu Mari and assistant director Masami Kuzū for &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;.

The first North American copy surfaced in the early 1990s at Kim&#x27;s Video in New York in a video series titled &quot;Dark of the Sun&quot; devoted to obscure Asian cinema, assembled by John Zorn, albeit without English subtitles. The Criterion Collection released the film in the United States and Canada on laserdisc in 1998, followed by a DVD on February 23, 1999, both containing a 15-minute interview with Suzuki, poster gallery of Shishido films and liner notes by Zorn. Home Vision Cinema release a VHS version on June 16, 2000. Both companies conjunctively released &quot;Tokyo Drifter&quot; in all three formats in addition to a VHS collection packaging the two films together. In the United Kingdom, Second Sight Films released a DVD on February 25, 2002, and a VHS on March 11, 2002. Yume Pictures released a new DVD on February 26, 2007, as a part of their Suzuki collection, featuring a 36-minute interview with the director, trailers and liner notes by Tony Rayns. Madman Entertainment&#x27;s Eastern Eye label released the film on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on May 2, 2007. It also contained the original trailer, a photo gallery and liner notes.

Criterion released &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; on Blu-ray on December 13, 2011; this release includes a 1997 interview with Suzuki and interviews conducted specifically for the Blu-ray featuring Suzuki, Kuzū and Shishido. Arrow Video released the film in the UK in a Blu-ray/DVD set on August 18, 2014; it includes an interview with Suzuki, an interview with Shishido conducted by writer Koshi Ueno, and &quot;Trapped in Lust&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

Forty years after the film&#x27;s original release, on February 23, 2007, the Japanese record label Think issued the soundtrack on Compact Disc through its &quot;Cine Jazz&quot; series, which focused on 1960s Nikkatsu action films. The music was culled from Naozumi Yamamoto&#x27;s score. Atsushi Yamatoya wrote the lyrics for the &quot;Killing Blues&quot; themes. Listings 27 through 29 are bonus karaoke tracks.

<text>Curtis Charles Flood Sr. (January 18, 1938 – January 20, 1997) was an American professional baseball player and activist. He was a center fielder who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Redlegs, St. Louis Cardinals, and Washington Senators.

Flood was a three-time All-Star, a Gold Glove winner for seven consecutive seasons, and batted over .300 in six seasons. He led the National League (NL) in hits (211) in 1964 and in singles, 1963, 1964, and 1968. Flood also led the National League in putouts as center fielder four times and in fielding percentage as center fielder three times. He retired with the third most games in center field (1683) in NL history, trailing Willie Mays and Richie Ashburn.

Flood became one of the pivotal figures in the sport&#x27;s labor history when he refused to accept a trade following the 1969 season, ultimately appealing his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although his legal challenge was unsuccessful, it brought about additional solidarity among players as they fought against baseball&#x27;s reserve clause and sought free agency.

==Early years==
Born in Houston, Texas, and raised in Oakland, California, Flood played in the same outfield in West Oakland&#x27;s McClymonds High School as Vada Pinson and Frank Robinson. All three would eventually sign professional contracts with the Cincinnati Reds. Flood transferred to Oakland Technical High School, from which he graduated.

==MLB career==
Flood signed with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1956 and made a handful of appearances for the team in 1956–57. However, Flood was deemed expendable with future star centerfielder Vada Pinson preparing to be promoted to the majors. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in December 1957.

For the next 12 seasons, he became a fixture in center field for St. Louis; although he struggled at the plate from 1958 to 1960, his defensive skill was apparent. He had his breakthrough year at the plate after Johnny Keane took over as manager in 1961: he batted .322, followed by .296 in 1962 with 11 home runs. He continued to improve offensively in 1963, hitting .302 and scoring a career-high 112 runs, third-most in the NL; he also had career bests in doubles (34), triples (9) and stolen bases (17) and collected 200 hits in an NL-leading 662 at bats. In that year he received the first of his seven consecutive Gold Gloves. 

He earned his first All-Star selection in 1964. He batted .311. His 679 at-bats led the NL again and were the fifth-highest total in league history to that point, setting a team record by surpassing Taylor Douthit&#x27;s 1930 total of 664; Lou Brock broke the team record three years later with 689. He tied for tops in hits with The Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Roberto Clemente with 211. Batting leadoff in the World Series against the New York Yankees, he hit only .200 but scored in three of the Cardinal victories as the team won in seven games for its first championship since 1946. In 1965, Flood had his greatest power output with 11 home runs and 83 runs batted in while he was hitting .310. He made the All-Star team again in 1966, a season in which he did not commit a single error in the outfield; his record errorless streak of 226 games (NL record for an outfielder) and 568 total chances (major league record) ran from September 3, 1965, to June 4, 1967.

In 1967, he had his highest batting mark with a .335 average (though his other batting totals fell off from previous years), helping the Cardinals to another championship. In the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, he hit a woeful .179 but made some crucial contributions. In game 1, he advanced Brock to third base twice, putting him in position to score both runs in a 2–1 victory; in game 3, he drove Brock in with the first run of a 5–2 win. As team co-captain (with Tim McCarver) in 1968 he had perhaps his best year, earning his third All-Star selection and finishing fourth in the MVP balloting (won by teammate Bob Gibson) on the strength of a .301 batting average and 186 base hits. Against the San Francisco Giants that year, Flood was involved in the final outs of the first back-to-back no-hitters in major league history. On September 17, he struck out for the final out of Gaylord Perry&#x27;s 1–0 gem. The next day, he caught Willie McCovey&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of Ray Washburn&#x27;s 2–0 no-hitter. 

Torrential rains the night before had soaked the Busch Stadium field, and had he not momentarily lost his footing chasing a Jim Northrup fly ball (ruled a triple) with two out in the seventh inning of game 7 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, the Cardinals might have won their third championship of the decade; Detroit scored twice on the play, with Northrup later coming in for a 3–0 lead, and won the game, 4–1. Up to that point, Flood had been enjoying the best series of his career despite dealing with personal problems at home, hitting .286 with three steals.

After the season ended, Flood was upset when Cardinals&#x27; president Gussie Busch, and CEO of team owner Anheuser-Busch, offered him only a $5,000 raise, far short of the $90,000 salary he believed he deserved after his stellar regular season. He believed Busch, with whom he had previously enjoyed a close personal friendship, was expressing his displeasure over the error that had likely cost the team the Series. While Busch eventually relented, Flood took it personally when Busch publicly chewed the team out after most players boycotted spring training before the 1969 season for a week, accusing players of forgetting that fans were what kept the sport going (although he did not mention any player by name).

In 1969, despite the lower pitching mound instituted that season, which saw a general rise in batting average league-wide, Flood&#x27;s batting average slipped to .285. His brother was arrested during the season. Late in the season, he publicly criticized the team for reorganizing before they were officially eliminated. He received his seventh Gold Glove that season just as other events in his career began to affect the entire sport. Flood collected the first hit in a major league regular-season game in Canada. He doubled off Montreal Expos pitcher Larry Jaster in the first inning of the Expos&#x27; inaugural home game on April 14 at Jarry Park. (Jaster, a Cardinal teammate of Flood&#x27;s the year before, had been selected by the Expos in the expansion draft.)

==Challenging the reserve clause==
Despite his outstanding playing career, Flood&#x27;s principal legacy developed off the field. He believed that Major League Baseball&#x27;s decades-old reserve clause was unfair in that it kept players beholden for life to the team with which they originally signed, even when they had satisfied the terms and conditions of those contracts.

On October 7, 1969, the Cardinals traded Flood, Tim McCarver, Byron Browne, and Joe Hoerner to the Philadelphia Phillies for Dick Allen, Cookie Rojas, and Jerry Johnson. Flood refused to report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team&#x27;s poor record and dilapidated Connie Mack Stadium, and for what he alleged were belligerent—and racist—fans. Flood said, &quot;That I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to report to Philadelphia, mainly because I didn&#x27;t want to pick up twelve years of my life and move to another city.&quot; Some reports say he was also irritated that he had learned of the trade from a reporter; but Flood wrote in his autobiography that he was told by midlevel Cardinals management and was angry that the call did not come from the general manager, further alienating him from Busch. He met with Phillies&#x27; general manager John Quinn, who left the meeting believing that he had persuaded Flood to report to the team. Flood stood to forfeit a lucrative $100,000 () contract if he did not report; but after a meeting with players&#x27; union head Marvin Miller, who informed him that the union was prepared to fund a lawsuit, he decided to pursue his legal options.

In a letter to Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, Flood demanded that the commissioner declare him a free agent:
:&quot;December 24, 1969&quot;
:&quot;After twelve years in the major leagues, I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes. I believe that any system which produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws of the United States and of the several States.&quot;

:&quot;It is my desire to play baseball in 1970, and I am capable of playing. I have received a contract offer from the Philadelphia club, but I believe I have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decision. I, therefore, request that you make known to all Major League clubs my feelings in this matter, and advise them of my availability for the 1970 season.&quot;

Flood was influenced by the events of the 1960s that took place in the United States. According to Marvin Miller, Flood told the executive board of the players&#x27; union, &quot;I think the change in black consciousness in recent years has made me more sensitive to injustice in every area of my life.&quot; However, he added that he was challenging the reserve clause primarily as a major league ballplayer.

===&quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot;===

Commissioner Kuhn denied Flood&#x27;s request for free agency, citing the propriety of the reserve clause and its inclusion in Flood&#x27;s 1969 contract. On January 16, 1970, Flood filed a $1 million lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball, alleging violation of federal antitrust laws. Flood likened the reserve clause to slavery. Among those testifying on his behalf were former players Jackie Robinson and Hank Greenberg, and former owner Bill Veeck. Although players&#x27; union representatives had voted unanimously to support Flood, rank-and-file players were divided, with many players believing that eliminating the reserve clause would hurt the game. Notably, Carl Yastrzemski stated that: &quot;Personally, I am against what Curt Flood is trying to do because it would ruin the game.&quot;

Notable players who openly supported Flood included Dick Allen and former teammate Lou Brock. Several bench players supported Flood as well, including pitcher Pete Richert who stated, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I think Curt Flood deserves a lot of praise. He has guts. I don&#x27;t know if I could give up a good salary for a principle. I&#x27;m behind him.&quot; Additionally, former Dodgers star pitcher Sandy Koufax, who staged a highly-publicized joint holdout with teammate Don Drysdale before the 1966 season, praised Flood: &quot;I have to give Curt the greatest amount of credit for believing in what he&#x27;s doing. At the salary he&#x27;s making, that&#x27;s the kind of money which he&#x27;s never going to get back.&quot;

&quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot; (407 U.S. 258) was argued before the Supreme Court on March 20, 1972. Flood&#x27;s attorney, former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, asserted that the reserve clause depressed wages and limited players to one team for life. Major League Baseball&#x27;s counsel, Louis Hoynes, countered that if Flood won his case, &quot;it would be a shambles.&quot; On June 19, 1972, the Supreme Court, invoking the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot; (&quot;to stand by things decided&quot;), ruled 5–3 in favor of Major League Baseball, citing as precedent a 1922 ruling in &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot; (259 U.S. 200). Justice Lewis Powell recused himself owing to his ownership of stock in Anheuser-Busch, which owned the Cardinals.

===Later legal developments===
Despite the loss in the Supreme Court, the baseball players&#x27; union continued to push to eliminate the reserve clause. It was finally struck down in December 1975 in a case involving players Dave McNally and Andy Messersmith. In July 1976, the union and the baseball team owners agreed to a contract that included free agency.

In 1998, the federal government passed the Curt Flood Act of 1998. The act, passed by the 105th Congress and signed into law by President Clinton, revokes baseball&#x27;s antitrust status (save for expansion, minor leagues, and franchise relocation), a status that major league baseball had enjoyed for seventy-five years after the Supreme Court had ruled that baseball was eligible for the status under interstate commerce. This act did exactly what Flood wanted; it stopped owners from controlling the players&#x27; contracts and careers.

Flood also helped bring about the 10/5 Rule, also known as the Curt Flood Rule. The rule states that when a player has played for a team for five straight years and played in MLB for a total of ten years, he has to give the club his consent to be traded.

==Aftermath==

=== Final years in baseball ===
After Flood&#x27;s lawsuit failed, Flood was blackballed from baseball. There were questions similar to &quot;Do you realize you won&#x27;t be able to play in MLB ever again?&quot; or &quot;You realize you are going to lose your job?&quot; Everyone Flood consulted was convinced he would be blackballed from baseball. Flood soon realized that his career was over as he later said,It would be difficult to come back. And besides, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be getting the opportunity to play again. As big as it is, baseball is a closely-knit unit. I doubt even one of the 24 men controlling the game . You can&#x27;t buck the Establishment.

Flood sat out the entire 1970 season. During this period he was bombarded with hate mail from fans, who accused him of trying to destroy baseball; his teammate Bob Gibson estimated &quot;He got four or five death threats a day.&quot; The Cardinals sent two minor leaguers to the Phillies as compensation for Flood&#x27;s refusal to report. One of them—centerfielder Willie Montañez—went on to a 14-year major league career. In November 1970, the Phillies traded Flood and four other players to the Washington Senators. He signed a $110,000 contract with Washington but played only thirteen games of the 1971 season, with a .200 batting average and lackluster play in center field. Despite manager Ted Williams&#x27;s vote of confidence, Flood left the team in late April and retired. He had a lifetime batting average of .293 with 1,861 hits, 85 home runs, 851 runs, and 636 RBI. Defensively, Flood posted a .987 fielding percentage in his major-league career. Later that year Flood published a memoir entitled &quot;The Way It Is&quot; in which he spelled out in detail his argument against the reserve clause.

===Retirement===
After his retirement, Flood purchased a bar in the resort town of Palma on the island of Majorca, where he had moved in the wake of the bankruptcy of his Curt Flood Associates business, two lawsuits, and an IRS lien on a home he bought for his mother. He returned to baseball as a member of the Oakland Athletics broadcasting team in 1978. In 1988 he was named commissioner of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association. In the mid-1990s, he joined the management group of the United Baseball League (UBL), which was envisioned as a smaller alternative to MLB. While the group negotiated a long-term TV contract with Liberty Media, the deal (and the UBL) failed when Liberty was absorbed by MLB contractor Fox Sports. In his spare time, he painted; his 1989 oil portrait of Joe DiMaggio sold at auction for $9,500 in 2006.

==Personal life and health ==
Flood was married twice. His first marriage was to Beverly Collins from 1959 until 1966, and together they had five children. Flood later married actress Judy Pace in 1986, whom he had met in the 1960s (Pace, recently divorced, had been married to actor Don Mitchell for the previous 13 years). They remained married until Flood&#x27;s death (10 years).

Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1995, Flood was initially given a 90–95 percent chance of survival. He underwent radiation treatments, chemotherapy, and throat surgery, which left him unable to speak.

==Death and legacy==
On January 20, 1997, just two days after his 59th birthday, Flood died at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after developing pneumonia, and was interred in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood.

Just before his death, Flood&#x27;s legacy was acknowledged in Congress in 1997 via the &quot;Baseball Fans and Communities Protection Act of 1997&quot;. Numbered HR 21 (Flood&#x27;s Cardinals uniform number) and introduced in the House of Representatives on the first day of the 105th Congress by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D–Michigan), the legislation established federal antitrust law protection for major league baseball players to the same extent as provided for other professional athletes.

Curt Flood is a nonparticipating but pivotal character in the book &quot;Our Gang&quot; by Philip Roth.

Flood&#x27;s struggle for free agency was featured in Ken Burns&#x27; documentary series &quot;Baseball&quot; in 1994. He was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 1999.

In 2020, 102 members of the U.S. Congress wrote a letter to the Baseball Hall of Fame, co-signed by Players&#x27; unions from the NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLS, asking the Hall of Fame to admit Flood.

<text>A disk array is a disk storage system which contains multiple disk drives. It is differentiated from a disk enclosure, in that an array has cache memory and advanced functionality, like RAID, deduplication, encryption and virtualization.

Components of a disk array include:

* Disk array controllers
* Cache in form of both volatile random-access memory and non-volatile flash memory.
* Disk enclosures for both magnetic rotational hard disk drives and electronic solid-state drives.
* Power supplies
Typically a disk array provides increased availability, resiliency, and maintainability by using additional redundant components (controllers, power supplies, fans, etc.), often up to the point where all single points of failure (SPOFs) are eliminated from the design. Additionally, disk array components are often hot-swappable.

Traditionally disk arrays were divided into categories:

* Network attached storage (NAS) arrays
* Storage area network (SAN) arrays:
** Modular SAN arrays
** Monolithic SAN arrays
** Utility Storage Arrays
* Storage virtualization

Primary vendors of storage systems include Coraid, Inc., DataDirect Networks, Dell EMC, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hitachi Data Systems, Huawei, IBM, Infortrend, NetApp, Oracle Corporation, Panasas, Pure Storage and other companies that often act as OEM for the above vendors and do not themselves market the storage components they manufacture.

<text>The [[national coat of arms|coat of arms]] of [[The Gambia]] has been in use since 18 November 1964. It depicts two lions holding an axe and hoe, supporting a shield that depicts another pair of hoe and axe, crossed. Atop the shield is set the heraldic helmet and an oil palm as a crest. At the bottom is the national motto: Progress – Peace – Prosperity. The Gambian coat of arms also appeared in the fly of the Gambian air force ensign.

==Overview==
The two lions represent the colonial history of The Gambia as part of the British Empire. The crossed axe and hoe represent the importance of agriculture to The Gambia. They are also considered to represent the two major ethnic groups of The Gambia: the Mandinka and the Fulani. The crest, a palm tree, is also a vital national tree.

The design was created by Nicholas Potin, a government employee with the Department of Surveys, who won a national competition to design it.

==History==
==Variations==
The Coat of arms of The Gambia Armed Forces service branches had variations: 

* Coat of arms used by The Gambian Army had a crossed sword in the shield.
* Coat of arms used by The Gambian Navy had an anchor in the shield.
* Coat of arms used by The Gambian Air Force had an eagle above national coat of arms.
