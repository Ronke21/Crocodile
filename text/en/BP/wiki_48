<text>Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara (16 May 1924 – 27 August 2019) was a Gambian politician who served as prime minister from 1962 to 1970, and then as the first President of The Gambia from 1970 to 1994, when he was deposed.

Jawara was born in Barajally, MacCarthy Island Division, now the Central River Region. He is the son of Mamma Fatty and Almami Jawara. He was educated at the Methodist Boys&#x27; School in Banjul (Bathurst) and then attended Achimota College in Ghana. He trained as a veterinary surgeon at the University of Glasgow&#x27;s School of Veterinary Medicine, then completed his training at the University of Liverpool and the University of Edinburgh. He returned to The Gambia in 1953 and married Augusta Mahoney, beginning work as a veterinary officer. He entered politics and became secretary of the new People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) and was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1960 election. He became the leader of the PPP and then the country&#x27;s first prime minister in 1962, only the second-ever head of government following Pierre Sarr N&#x27;Jie&#x27;s term as Chief Minister.

Under Jawara, The Gambia gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. He remained as prime minister and Elizabeth II remained as head of state as Queen of The Gambia. In 1970, The Gambia became a republic, and Jawara was elected as its first president. The greatest challenge to Jawara&#x27;s power came in 1981 when an attempted coup d&#x27;état took place and soldiers from neighbouring Senegal were forced to intervene, with 400 to 800 deaths reported by the end of the coup attempt. Following the coup attempt, Jawara and Senegalese President Abdou Diouf announced the creation of the Senegambia Confederation, but it proved to be short-lived and ultimately collapsed eight years later in 1989.

Jawara continued to rule until 1994 when a coup d&#x27;état led by Yahya Jammeh seized power. Following this, he went into exile, but returned in 2002, and lived in retirement in The Gambia until his death in 2019.

==Childhood and early education==
Dawda Jawara was born in 1924 to Almammi Jawara and Mamma Fatty in the village of Barajally Tenda in the central river region of The Gambia, approximately from the capital, Banjul, then called Bathurst. One of six sons, Dawda was the last born on his mother&#x27;s side and a younger brother to sister Na Ceesay and brothers Basaddi and Sheriffo Jawara.

Their father Almammi, who had several wives, was a well-to-do trader from an aristocratic family who commuted from Barajally Tenda to his trading post in Wally Kunda. His family, the Jawaras, had once served as members of the Gbara of Old Mali.

Dawda from an early age attended the local Arabic schools to memorize the Quran, a rite of passage for many Gambian children. There were no primary schools in Barajally Tenda: the nearest was in Georgetown (Janjanbureh), the provincial capital, but this boarding school was reserved for the sons of the chiefs.

Around 1933, young Jawara&#x27;s formal education was sponsored by a friend of his father, a trader named Ebrima Youma Jallow, whose trading post was across the street from Alammi&#x27;s in Wally-Kunda. Dawda was enrolled at Mohammedan primary school where he was taught by I.M. Garba-Jahumpa. After graduation from Mohammedan, Jawara won a scholarship to an all-boys High School, where he enjoyed all his classes, but showed the greatest aptitude in science and mathematics. Upon matriculation in 1945, he worked as a nurse until 1947 at the Victoria Hospital in Bathurst (now Banjul). The limited career and educational opportunities in colonial Gambia led to a year&#x27;s stint at Prince of Wales College and School in Achimota, Accra, in the then Gold Coast, where he studied science. While at Prince of Wales College and School (popularly known as Achimota College), Jawara showed little interest in politics at a time when Ghana and many colonies in Africa were beginning to become restless for political independence or internal self-government. While he was happy to have met Ghana&#x27;s founding father, Kwame Nkrumah, the impact did not prove significant at the time.

After attending Achimota College, Jawara won a scholarship to Scotland&#x27;s Glasgow University to study veterinary medicine. At the time, colonial education was intended to train Africans for the most menial of clerical tasks in the civil service. And it was rare for Gambians to be awarded scholarships in the sciences. It was at Glasgow University in the late 1940s, that Jawara&#x27;s interest in politics began. In 1948 he joined the African Students Association and was later elected secretary-general and president, respectively. Also, while at Glasgow, Jawara honed his political interests and skills by joining the Student Labour Party Organization, Forward Group, and became active in labour politics of the time. Though never a &quot;leftist&quot;, Jawara immersed himself in the Labour Party’s socialist politics and ideology. At Glasgow Jawara met Cheddi Jagan, who later became Premier of British Guiana, now Guyana. Jawara classified this period in his life “as very interesting politically”. It was a moment of rising Pan-Africanist fervour and personal growth politically. He completed his studies in 1953. He later returned to Scotland to gain a further diploma in tropical veterinary medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1957. 

==Return to The Gambia==

When Jawara returned home in 1953 after completing his studies as a veterinary surgeon, he first served as a veterinary officer. In 1955 he married Augusta Mahoney, daughter of Sir John Mahoney, a prominent Aku in Bathurst. The Aku, a small and educated group, are descendants of freed slaves who settled in The Gambia after manumission. Despite their relatively small size, they came to dominate both the social, political, and economic life of the colony. Many opponents claim that it was pragmatic, albeit an unusual, fulfillment of Jawara&#x27;s wish to marry a well-to-do Anglican woman.

As a veterinary officer, Jawara traveled the length and breadth of The Gambia for months vaccinating cattle. In the process, he established valuable social contacts and relationships with the relatively well-to-do cattle owners in the protectorate. This group, with the district chiefs and village heads, in later years formed the bulk of his initial political support. As noted, British colonial policy at that time divided The Gambia into two sections; the colony and the protectorate. Adults in the colony area, which included Bathurst and the Kombo St. Mary sub-regions, were franchised, while their counterparts in the protectorate were not. Political activity and representation at the Legislative Council were limited to the colony.

At the time of his return to The Gambia, politics in the colony were dominated by a group of urban elites from Bathurst and the Kombo St. Mary&#x27;s areas. At a meeting in 1959 at Basse, a major commercial town almost at the end of The Gambia River, the leadership of the People&#x27;s Progressive Society decided to change its name to challenge the urban-based parties and their leaders. Thus was born the Protectorate People&#x27;s Party.

The same year, a delegation headed by Sanjally Bojang (a well-off patron and founding member of the new party), Bokarr Fofanah and Madiba Janneh, arrived at Abuko to inform Jawara of his nomination as secretary of the party. Jawara resigned his position as chief veterinary officer in order to contest the 1960 election. The Protectorate People&#x27;s Party was renamed the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) to make the party inclusive as opposed to the generally held perception of it being a Mandinka-based party. Over time, the PPP and Jawara would supersede the urban-based parties and their leaders. This change is what Arnold Hughes termed a &quot;Green Revolution&quot;, a political process in which a rural elite emerges to challenge and defeat an urban-based political petty-bourgeoisie.

Jawara&#x27;s ascendance to the leadership of the party was hardly contested. As one of the few university graduates from the protectorate, the only other possible candidate was Dr. Lamin Marena from Kudang.

==Self-government in The Gambia==

In 1962, Jawara became prime minister, which laid the foundation for PPP and Jawara domination of The Gambia&#x27;s political landscape. With Jawara&#x27;s rise to power after the 1962 elections, the colonial administration began a gradual withdrawal from The Gambia, and self-government was granted in 1963. Jawara was appointed prime minister in the same year, and independence came on February 18, 1965. This completed The Gambia&#x27;s peaceful transition from colonial rule.

With a small civil service, staffed mostly by the Aku and urban Wollofs, Jawara, and the PPP sought to build a nation and develop an economy to sustain both farmers and urban dwellers. Many in the rural areas hoped that political independence would bring with an immediate improvement in their life circumstances. These high expectations, as in other newly independent ex-colonies, stemmed partly from the extravagant promises made by some political leaders. In time, however, a measure of disappointment set in as the people quickly discovered that their leaders could not deliver on all their promises.

During the self-government period of 1962–65, promising overtures were made from Jawara to Senegal. In November 1962, Jawara asked the United Nations (UN) to appoint experts to assess the future of Senegal and The Gambia together, which U Thant, the Secretary-General, agreed to. The British attitude was said to be one of &quot;friendly encouragement&quot;. In March 1964, following a visit from Léopold Sédar Senghor, intentions to coordinate The Gambia&#x27;s and Senegal&#x27;s economic programmes were announced. Particular focus was to be placed on the field of agriculture.

==1981 attempted coup==
The greatest challenge to Dawda Jawara&#x27;s rule (other than the coup that ended his power in 1994) was an attempted coup in 1981, headed by a disgruntled ex-politician turned Marxist, Kukoi Samba Sanyang. The coup, which followed a weakening of the economy and allegations of corruption against leading politicians, occurred on July 29, 1981, and was carried out by the leftist National Revolutionary Council, composed of Kukoi Samba Sanyang&#x27;s Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party and elements of the &quot;Field Force&quot; (a paramilitary force which constituted the bulk of the country&#x27;s armed forces).

President Jawara immediately requested military aid from Senegal which deployed 400 troops to The Gambia on July 31, and by August 6 2,700 Senegalese troops had been deployed and they had defeated the coup leaders&#x27; forces. Between 500 and 800 people were killed during the coup and the resulting violence.

The attempted coup reflected the desire for change, at least on the part of some civilians and their allies in the Field Force. Despite Kukoi&#x27;s failure to assume power, the attempted coup revealed major weaknesses within the ruling PPP and society as a whole. The hegemony of the PPP, contraction of intra-party competition, and growing social inequalities were factors that could not be discounted. Also crucial to the causes of the aborted coup was a deteriorating economy whose major victims were the urban youth in particular. In his 1981 New Year message, Jawara explained The Gambia&#x27;s economic problems thus: 

The most striking consequence of the aborted coup was the intervention of the Senegalese troops at the request of Jawara, as a result of the defense treaty signed between the two countries in 1965. At the time of the aborted coup, Jawara was attending the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer in London and flew immediately to Dakar to consult with President Abdou Diouf. While Senegal&#x27;s intervention was ostensibly to rescue President Jawara&#x27;s regime, it had the effect of undermining Gambian sovereignty, which was something that had been jealously guarded by Gambians and Jawara in particular. Yet it was relinquished expediently. The presence of Senegalese troops in Banjul was testimony to Jawara&#x27;s growing reliance on Senegal, which consequently was a source of much resentment.

==Senegambian Confederation==

Three weeks after the aborted coup and the successful restoration of Jawara by Senegalese troops, Presidents Diouf and Jawara, at a joint press conference, announced plans for the establishment of the Senegambian Confederation. In December 1981, five months after the foiled coup, the treaties of confederation were signed in Dakar. The speed with which the treaties were signed and the lack of input from the bulk of The Gambian population suggested to many that the arrangement was an exercise in political expedience. President Jawara was under great pressure because of the repercussions of the aborted coup and the Senegalese government. Under the treaty with Senegal, Diouf served as president and Jawara as his vice president. A confederal parliament and cabinet were set up with several ministerial positions going to The Gambia. Additionally, a new Gambian army was created as part of a new confederate army.

The creation of a new Gambian army was cause for concern for many observers. Such an institution, it was felt, would by no means diminish the recurrence of the events of July 30, 1981, nor would it guarantee the regime&#x27;s stability. By agreeing to the creation of an army, Jawara had planted the very seeds of his eventual political demise. The army would in time become a serious contender for political office, different from political parties only in its control over the instruments of violence. Such an atmosphere, however, as the events of 1994 would show, was fertile ground for coups and counter coups. Perhaps more importantly, the creation of a new army diverted limited resources that could have otherwise been used to enhance the strong rural development programmes of the PPP government. The confederation collapsed in 1989.

Jawara did not resort to the authoritarian and often punitive backlash that follows coups in most of Africa. Instead, he made overtures of reconciliation, with judicious and speedy trial and subsequent release of over 800 detainees. Individuals who received death sentence convictions were committed to life in prison instead, and many prisoners were released for lack of sufficient evidence. More serious offenders were tried by an impartial panel of judges drawn from Anglophone Commonwealth countries. International goodwill toward the regime was immediate and generous and before long, Jawara had begun a process of political and economic reconstruction of the country.

==Economic reform==

The Gambia was incorporated into the world economy as a supplier of agricultural exports (largely groundnuts) and tourism. Since independence, there has been little change in the structure of the economy, which remains very heavily dependent on groundnut production. Agriculture and tourism are the dominant sectors and also the main sources of foreign exchange, employment, and income for the country. Thanks to the growing economy, the government introduced in the 1970s the policy of &#x27;Gambianisation&#x27;, which led to an expansion of the state&#x27;s role in the economy. There was a 75 percent increase in total government employment over the period from 1975 to 1980.

In mid-1985, The Gambia under Jawara initiated the Economic Recovery Program (ERP), one of the most comprehensive economic adjustment programmes devised by any country in sub-Saharan Africa. With the aid of a team of economists from the Harvard Institute for International Development and the International Monetary Fund, The Gambia greatly reformed the economic structure of the country. Under ERP, in 1985–86, the deficit was 72 million Dalasis, and it increased to 169 million Dalasis in 1990–91. However, by mid-1986, just a year after the ERP was established, the revival of The Gambian economy had begun. The government reduced its budget deficit, increased its foreign exchange reserves, and eliminated its debt service arrears.

Under the ERP, economic opportunities became more abundant, and many private businessmen and public officials turned to illegal means to make profit. Corruption created a serious legitimacy crisis for the PPP. Several cases of corruption were revealed and these seriously indicted the PPP regime. The Gambia Commercial Development Bank collapsed, largely due to its failure to collect loans. The Asset Management and Recovery Corporation (AMRC) was set up under an Act of Parliament in 1992, but the PPP government was not willing to use its influence to assist AMRC in its recovery exercise. This was particularly embarrassing because the people and organisations with the highest loans were close to PPP. In an embezzlement scheme at The Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU), fraud was revealed in Customs, and through the process of privatisation, it was discovered that many dummy loans had been given to well-connected individuals at GCDB.

A group of para-statal heads and big businessmen closely associated with the PPP (nicknamed the Banjul Mafia) were seen as the culprits responsible for corruption in the public sector. Driven to make profit, many elites did not refrain from manipulating state power to maintain a lifestyle of wealth and privilege. Corruption had become a serious problem in The Gambia, especially during the last two years of the PPP rule.

By 1992, The Gambia was one of the poorest countries in Africa and the world, with a 45-year life expectancy at birth, an infant mortality rate of 130 per 1000 live births, a child mortality rate of 292 per 1000, and an under-five mortality rate of 227 per 1000. At that time, 120 out of every 1000 live births died of malaria. The Gambia also had a 75 percent illiteracy rate, only 40 percent of the population had access to potable water supply, and over 75 percent of the population were living in absolute poverty.

Structural adjustment programmes implemented in response to the economic crisis resulted in government fragmentation, privatisation, less patronage in co-opting various groups and growing corruption. The 30 years the PPP regime operated with diminished resources and therefore could no longer rule as it always had. The credibility of the competitive party system was severely challenged as Jawara&#x27;s PPP was unable to show that good economic management could lead to benefits for the majority of society. Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, the first President of The Gambia, played a significant role in shaping the country&#x27;s early economic policies following its independence from British colonial rule in 1965. During his tenure, which lasted until 1994, government focused on various economic reforms aimed at promoting stability, development, and growth in The Gambia.

# Agricultural Development particularly groundnut (peanut) farming, was the backbone of Th Gambia&#x27;s economy during his presidency.
# Trade and export promotion which recognising the importance of trade for the Gambian economy, Jawara&#x27;s government worked to improve the country&#x27;s trade relations and expand its export base, particularly in agricultural products.
# Infrastructure development such as investment of road networks, energy, and telecommunications, which especially for rural populations, were crucial for promoting trade and expanding access to markets.
# The promotion of tourism under Jawara&#x27;s direction, the Gambia&#x27;s tourism sector started to grow. His government marketed The Gambia as a travel destination, especially for European tourists, seeing the potential of tourism as a source of foreign cash and jobs.

==Regime survival==

With Jawara&#x27;s precarious hold on power at Gambian independence, his low caste status constituted a grave handicap and one which threatened to overshadow his strengths (most notably, a university education). The two pre-independence challenges to Jawara&#x27;s position demonstrated his vulnerability and illustrated the fact that he could not rely upon the undivided loyalty of the party&#x27;s founding members. At independence, Jawara&#x27;s lieutenants regarded him as their representative, almost a nominal leader, and clearly intended him to promote their personal advancement.

Given these circumstances, Jawara&#x27;s task was to overcome his low caste status, assert his authority over the party, and secure control over its political direction. In doing this, he did not use coercion. Politically inspired “disappearances” were never an element of PPP rule; neither opponents nor supporters suffered harassment or periods of detention on fabricated charges. That Jawara was able to eschew coercive techniques and still survive reflected an element of good fortune, and yet his skillful political leadership was also crucial. Within his own party Jawara was fortunate to be surrounded by individuals willing to refrain from violence to achieve their goals, and yet much of the credit for this restraint must go to Jawara—his skillful manipulation of patronage resources, cultivation of affective ties and shrewd balancing of factions within the PPP. Lacking the coercive option, and given that affective ties, which had to be earned, were a medium- to long-term resource, Jawara initially relied heavily on instrumental ties and distribution of patronage. His limited resource base posed an obvious, though not insurmountable, problem. 

Within the ruling group, ministerial positions—which provided a generous salary, perks and for some, access to illicit wealth—constituted the most sought after form of patronage and yet, before 1970, the number of ministerial posts did not exceed seven. 

By 1992, the number remained a comparatively modest fourteen. Despite these limits, Jawara skillfully used all the various permutations of patronage distribution (appointment, promotion, termination, demotion, and rehabilitation) to dramatise his power over subordinates’ political futures and entrench himself as a leader.

In response to the pre-1965 challenges to his authority, Jawara moved to reduce the size, cohesion, and authority of the founding members as a group. Many of the party&#x27;s earliest adherents (even those who showed no outward sign of disloyalty) lost ministerial posts during the early years of PPP rule. Jawara may not have used force, but neither was he hampered by sentiment; his pragmatism and willingness to demote, or even drop, former supporters in order to strengthen his personal political position was apparent. Jawara further strengthened his political position with the incorporation of new sources of support within the ruling group.

His enthusiasm for political accommodation stemmed from the closely related imperatives of weakening the influence of the PPP&#x27;s original members and avoiding political isolation. The original group resented the fact that newcomers had not participated in the early struggle for power and yet were now enjoying the fruits of their labour. The secondary factor of ethno-regional considerations compounded this resentment; those who were co-opted came from all ethnic groups in the former colony and protectorate.

Jawara&#x27;s popular support and cultivation of affective ties were crucial for easing the pressure on scarce patronage resources. Although the skillful distribution of patronage and associated tolerance of corruption (to be discussed later) played an important role in the PPP&#x27;s survival, Jawara did not rely on elite-level resource distribution as heavily as some of his counterparts.

==Corruption and political survival==

For many years observers viewed corruption in The Gambia as significantly less prevalent than in many other African states. In retrospect, this view appears overstated, though it is true that corruption did not reach the heights seen elsewhere. Jawara himself refrained from excessive self-enrichment and many of his lieutenants followed suit. Conflicting survival imperatives—in particular, the need for foreign aid and popular support, both of which were unlikely to be forthcoming under a thoroughly corrupt regime, persuaded Jawara to set some limits on “allowable” corruption. The possibility of exposure in parliament or by the press provided a further constraint.

Nevertheless, events during the closing years of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party rule together with post-coup revelations and inquiries suggest that corruption was both a significant phenomenon and one which played an important role in the PPP&#x27;s survival. Jawara understood the political advantages of corruption. Fundamentally, corruption formed an important component of the patronage network, facilitating elite accumulation. It provided a means of creating and sustaining mutually beneficial and supportive relationships between PPP politicians (headed by Jawara), senior civil servants, and Gambian businessmen.

Initially, then, corruption played a significant part in the survival of the PPP, uniting political, bureaucratic, and business interests in a series of mutually beneficial and supportive relationships. In the longer term, however, it served to undermine the regime. Perhaps the first indication of this occurred in 1981 when, during the coup attempt of that year, Kukoi Samba Sanyang cited “corruption and the squandering of public funds” as a primary motive of intervention. No doubt there was a strong element of opportunism in Sanyang&#x27;s actions, yet the fact that he seized upon corruption as a suitable justification for his actions reflected increasing public awareness of the problem.

Just a month prior to the coup, Reverend Ian Roach had spoken out publicly against corruption, the local press reported numerous instances of low-level bureaucratic theft, and higher up, Jawara&#x27;s leniency towards the ministers and civil servants towards the end of the 1970s was widely resented. The increased public awareness of corruption weakened the PPP regime and furnished the 1994 conspirators with a suitable pretext for intervention. Since many soldiers reportedly regarded their unsatisfactory living conditions as a manifestation of corruption, it also gave them a motive. Jawara may have underestimated the real risk a new army would pose to himself and the country, and in fact, may have dragged his feet in dealing accordingly with corruption. To this accusation he responded:

Many African leaders are aware of the positive relationship between popular support and elite acquiescence. However, resource shortages had more likely than not persuaded leaders to priorities in favour of elites. In The Gambia, two additional factors persuaded Jawara to pursue a somewhat different route to political survival. On the one hand, the PPP needed to win successive multi-party elections. On the other, Jawara&#x27;s rejection of coercion as a survival technique meant that overt public challenges could not simply be suppressed; it was vital the latent threat posed by specific societal groups remain dormant. Fortunately, Jawara did have a great deal of public support.

==1994 coup==

In December 1991, Jawara announced that he would not seek re-election in 1992. After 30 years of leading his country, he decided to retire. However, his announcement was met with panic, so he consented to stand for re-election again. The question of his retirement continued to loom over The Gambia&#x27;s political future, however, and dissent mounted. He was re-elected with 56% of the vote.

On 22 July 1994, a group of soldiers led by Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh stormed the capital. The coup was successful and Jawara was exiled until 2002. Compared with the previous attempt to overthrow Jawara, though, this coup was deemed &quot;bloodless&quot;. Jawara escaped unharmed: he was taken to Senegal by an American warship that was in the area when the coup began. Jawara had hoped that his work would create an economically prosperous society based on his priorities: democracy, unity, and tolerance for personal differences. However, the new self-appointed, five-man ruling council dissolved the constitution and established a nationwide curfew until democracy was reinstated (at least on paper).

He returned to The Gambia as an elder statesman, but was forbidden to take part in politics for the rest of his life. He went to Nigeria in 2007 after being selected to head a West African team (ECOWAS) to assess Nigeria&#x27;s preparedness for its April 2007 presidential election. He then took residence in the town of Fajara where he died. 

On 3 February 2017, Jawara was visited at his home by the newly elected president Adama Barrow and pledged to render support to Barrow&#x27;s government.

When he died, Sir Dawda was the last living Gambian who had been conferred a knighthood (in the 1966 New Year Honours) under the monarchy of the Gambia.

==Depiction on Gambian currency==

<text>Clostridium perfringens (formerly known as &quot;C. welchii&quot;, or &quot;Bacillus welchii&quot;) is a Gram-positive, bacillus (rod-shaped), anaerobic, spore-forming pathogenic bacterium of the genus &quot;Clostridium&quot;. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is ever-present in nature and can be found as a normal component of decaying vegetation, marine sediment, the intestinal tract of humans and other vertebrates, insects, and soil. It has the shortest reported generation time of any organism at 6.3 minutes in thioglycolate medium.

&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the United States, alongside norovirus, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. However, it can sometimes be ingested and cause no harm.

Infections induced by &quot;C. perfringens&quot; are associated with tissue necrosis, bacteremia, emphysematous cholecystitis, and gas gangrene, which is also known as clostridial myonecrosis. The specific name, &quot;perfringens,&quot; is derived from the Latin (meaning &quot;through&quot;) and (&quot;burst&quot;), referring to the disruption of tissue that occurs during gas gangrene. Gas gangrene is caused by alpha toxin, or α-toxin, that embeds itself into the plasma membrane of cells and disrupts normal cellular function by altering membrane structure. Research suggests that &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is capable of engaging in polymicrobial anaerobic infections. It is commonly encountered in infections as a component of the normal flora. In this case, its role in disease is minor.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; toxins are a result of horizontal gene transfer of a neighboring cell&#x27;s plasmids. Shifts in genomic make-up are common for this species of bacterium and contribute to novel pathogenesis. Major toxins are expressed differently in certain populations of &quot;C. perfringens;&quot; these populations are organized into strains based on their expressed toxins. This especially impacts the food industry, as controlling this microbe is important for preventing foodborne illness. Novel findings in &quot;C. perfringens&quot; hyper-motility, which was provisionally thought as non-motile, have been discovered as well. Findings in metabolic processes reveal more information concerning &quot;C. perfringens&quot; pathogenic nature.

== Genome ==
&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; has a stable G+C content around 27 to 28 percent and average genome size of 3.5 Mb. Genomes of 56 &quot;C. perfringens&quot; strains have since been made available on the NCBI genomes database for the scientific research community. Genomic research has revealed surprisingly high diversity in &quot;C. perfringens&quot; pangenome, with only 12.6 percent core genes, identified as the most divergent Gram-positive bacteria reported. Nevertheless, 16S rRNA regions in between &quot;C. perfringens&quot; strains are found to be highly conserved (sequence identity &gt;99.1%).

The &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; enterotoxin (CPE)–producing strain has been identified to be a small portion of the overall &quot;C. perfringens&quot; population (~1-5%) through genomic testing. Advances in genetic information surrounding strain A CPE &quot;C. perfringens&quot; has allowed techniques such as microbial source tracking (MST) to identify food contamination sources. The CPE gene has been found within chromosomal DNA as well as plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA has been shown to play and integral role in cell pathogenesis and encodes for major toxins, including CPE.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; has been shown to carry plasmid-containing genes for antibiotic resistance. The pCW3 plasmid is the primary conjugation plasmid responsible for creating antibiotic resistance in &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. Furthermore, the pCW3 plasmid also encodes for multiple toxins found in pathogenic strains of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. Antibiotic resistance genes observed thus far include tetracycline resistance, efflux protein, and aminoglycoside resistance.

Within industrial contexts, such as food production, sequencing genomes for pathogenic strains of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; has become an expanding field of research. Poultry production is impacted directly from this trend as antibiotic-resistant strains of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; are becoming more common. By performing a meta-genome analysis, researches are capable to identify novel strains of pathogenic bacterium, such as &quot;C. perfringens&quot; B20.

== Motility ==
&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is provisionally identified as non-motile. They lack flagella; however, recent research suggests gliding as a form of motility.

=== Hyper-motile variations ===

In agar plate cultures bacteria with hypermotile variations like SM101 frequently appear around the borders of the colonies. They create long thin filaments that enable them to move quickly, much like bacteria with flagella, according to video imaging of their gliding motion. The causes of the hypermotile phenotype and its immediate descendants were found using genome sequencing. The hypermotile offspring of strains SM101 and SM102, SM124 and SM127, respectively, had 10 and 6 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in comparison to their parent strains. The hypermotile strains have the common trait of gene mutations related to cell division.

=== Regulation of gliding motility: The CpAL/VirSR system ===
Some strains of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; cause various diseases like gas gangrene and myonecrosis. Toxins produced that are required for myonecrosis is regulated by the &quot;C. perfringens&quot; Agr-like (CpAl) system through the VirSR two-component system. The CpAL/VirSR system is a quorum sensing system encoded by other pathogenic clostridia. Myonecrosis starts at the infection site and involves bacteria migrating deeper via gliding motility. Researchers investigated if the CpAL/VirSR system regulates gliding motility. The study demonstrated that the CpAL/VirSR regulates &quot;C. perfringens&quot; gliding motility. Additionally, the study suggests that gliding bacteria in myonecrosis have increased transcription of toxin genes.

== Transformation ==

There are two methods of genetic manipulation via experimentation that have been shown to cause genetic transformation in &quot;C. perfringens&quot;.

=== Protoplast transformation ===
The first report of transformation in &quot;C. perfringens&quot; involved polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation of protoplasts. The transformation procedure involved the addition of the plasmid DNA to the protoplasts in the presence of high concentrations of polyethylene glycol. During the first protoplast transformation experiment, L-phase variants of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; were generated by penicillin treatment in the presence 0.4m sucrose. After the transformation procedure was completed, all of the transformed cells were still in the form of L-phase variants. Reversion to vegetative cells was not obtained, but it was observed that autoplasts (protoplasts derived from autolysis) were able to be regenerated to produce rods with cell walls and could be transformed with &quot;C. perfringens&quot; plasmid DNA.

=== Electroporation ===
Electroporation involves the application of a high-voltage electric field to vegetative bacteria cells for a very short period. This technique resulted in major advances in genetic transformation of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, due to the bacteria often displaying itself as a vegetative cell or as dormant spores in food. The electric pulse creates pores in the bacterial cell membrane and allows the passive influx of DNA molecules.

== Metabolic processes ==
&quot;C. perfringens&quot; is an aerotolerant anaerobe bacterium that lives in a variety of environments including soil and human intestinal tract. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is incapable of synthesizing multiple amino acids due to the lack of genes required for biosynthesis. Instead, the bacterium produces enzymes and toxins to break down host cells and import nutrients from the degrading cell.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; has a complete set of enzymes for glycolysis and glycogen metabolism. In the fermentation pathway, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, producing CO2 gas and reduced ferredoxin. Electrons from the reduced ferredoxin are transferred to protons by hydrogenase, resulting in the formation of hydrogen molecules (H2) that are released from the cell along with CO2. Pyruvate is also converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, whereas acetyl-CoA is converted into ethanol, acetate, and butyrate through various enzymatic reactions, completing the anaerobic glycolysis that serves as a potential main energy source for &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; utilizes a variety of sugars such as fructose, galactose, glycogen, lactose, maltose, mannose, raffinose, starch, and sucrose, and various genes for glycolytic enzymes. The amino acids of these various enzymes and sugar molecules are converted to propionate through propionyl-CoA, which results in energy production.

== Virulence ==
Membrane-damaging enzymes, pore-forming toxins, intracellular toxins, and hydrolytic enzymes are the functional categories into which &quot;C. perfringens&quot;&#x27; virulence factors may be divided. These virulence factor-encoding genes can be found on chromosomes and large plasmids.

=== Carbohydrate-active enzymes ===
The human gastrointestinal tract is lined with intestinal mucosa that secrete mucus and act as a defense mechanism against pathogens, toxins, and harmful substances. Mucus is made up of mucins containing several O-linked glycan glycoproteins that recognizes and forms a barrier around microbes, preventing them from attaching to endothelial cells and infecting them. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; can secrete different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that aid in degrading mucins and other O-glycans within the intestinal mucosa. These enzymes include: Sialidases, Hexosaminidases, Galactosidases, and Fucosidases belonging to various glycoside hydrolase families.

==== Sialidase ====
Sialidases, also called neuraminidases, function to breakdown mucin by hydrolyzing the terminal sialic acid residues located within the protein through the process of desialylation. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; has three sialidases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 33 (GH33): NanH, NanI, and NanJ. All strains of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; encode for at least one of these enzymes.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; can secrete NanI and NanJ through secretion signal peptides located on each protein. Research suggests that NanH operates in the cytoplasm of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, as it does not contain a secretion signal peptide. NanH contains only a catalytic domain, whereas NanI and NanJ contain a catalytic domain and additional carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) to aid in catalytic activity. Located on their N-terminals, NanI contains CBM40, whereas NanJ contains both CBM40 and CBM32. Based on studies analyzing the three-dimensional structure of NanI, its active site has a pocket-like orientation that aids in the removal of sialic acid residues from sialomucins in the intestinal mucosa.

==== Hexosaminidase ====
The mucus layer consists of intestinal mucin glycans, glycolipids, and glycoproteins that contain hexosamines, such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). &quot;C. perfringens&quot; encodes for eight hexosaminidases that break down hexosamines in the mucus. These hexosaminidases belong to four glycoside hydrolase families: GH36, GH84, GH89, and GH123.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; encodes for AagA (&quot;Cp&quot;GH36A) and &quot;Cp&quot;GH36B in glycoside hydrolase family 36 (GH36): AagA removes GalNAc from O-glycans, and &quot;Cp&quot;GH36B is expected to have a similar structure to AagA, but specificities on its function are unknown. NagH, NagI, NagJ, and NagK, belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 84 (GH84), cleave terminal GlcNAc residues using a substrate-assisted digestion mechanism. AgnC (&quot;Cp&quot;GH89), belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 89 (GH89), both cleaves GlcNAc from the ends of mucin glycans and acts on gastric mucin. Belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 123 (GH123), &quot;Cp&quot;Nga123 cleaves GalNAc, but research suggests that it only breaks down glycans taken up by &quot;C. perfringens&quot; due to the absence of a secretion signal peptide.

==== Galactosidase ====
&quot;C. perfringens&quot; has four galactosidases that belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 2 (GH2): &quot;Cp&quot;GH2A, &quot;Cp&quot;GH2B, &quot;Cp&quot;GH2C, and &quot;Cp&quot;GH2D. Research suggests that these enzymes are effective at breaking down core mucin glycan structures with the ability to bind galactose using CBM51. However, minimal research exists on the specific functioning of galactosidases in &quot;C. perfringens&quot;.

==== Fucosidase ====
Fucose monosaccharides are located on the terminal ends of core O-linked glycans. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; encodes for three fucosidases that belong to two glycoside hydrolase families: Afc1 and Afc2 in glycoside hydrolase family 29 (GH29), and Afc3 in glycoside hydrolase family 95 (GH95). Afc3 contains a C-terminal CBM51 and is the only fucosidase that contains a carbohydrate-binding module in &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. Fucosyl residues tend to cover the ends of glycans and protect them against enzymatic digestion, so research suggests that the ability of fucosidases to cleave complex and diverse fucosyl linkages is due to long-term adaptations in &quot;C. perfringens&quot; that persisted within close range of mucins.

=== Major toxins ===
There are five major toxins produced by &quot;Clostridium perfringens.&quot; Alpha, beta, epsilon and enterotoxin are toxins that increase a cells permeability which causes an ion imbalance while iota toxins destroy the cell&#x27;s actin cytoskeleton. On the basis of which major, &quot;typing&quot; toxins are produced, &quot;C. perfringens&quot; can be classified into seven &quot;toxinotypes&quot;, A, B, C, D, E, F and G:
==== Alpha toxin ====
Alpha toxin (CPA) is a zinc-containing phospholipase C, composed of two structural domains, which destroy a cell&#x27;s membrane. Alpha toxins are produced by all five types of &quot;C. perfringens.&quot; This toxin is linked to gas gangrene of humans and animals. Most cases of gas gangrene has been related to a deep wound being contaminated by soil that harbors &quot;C. perfringens&quot;.

==== Beta toxin ====
Beta toxins (CPB) are a protein that causes hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis and enterotoxaemia in both animals (type B) and humans (type C) which leads to the infected individual&#x27;s feces becoming bloody and their intestines necrotizing. Proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, can break down CPB, making them ineffective. Therefore, the presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum makes CPB especially deadly for mammal offspring.

==== Epsilon toxin ====
Epsilon toxin (ETX) is a protein produced by type B and type D strains of &quot;C. perfringens.&quot; This toxin is currently ranked the third most potent bacterial toxin known. ETX causes enterotoxaemia in mainly goats and sheep, but cattle are sometime susceptible to it as well. An experiment using mice found that ETX had an LD50 of 50-110 ng/kg. The excessive production of ETX increases the permeability of the intestines. This causes severe edema in organs such as the brain and kidneys.

The very low LD50 of ETX has led to concern that it may be used as a bioweapon. It appeared on the select agent lists of the US CDC and USDA, until it was removed in 2012. There are no human vaccines for this toxin, but effective vaccines for animals exist.

==== Iota toxin ====
Iota toxin (ITX) is a protein produced by type E strains of &quot;C. perfringens.&quot; Iota toxins are made up of two, unlinked proteins that form a multimeric complex on cells. Iota toxins prevent the formation of filamentous actin. This causes the destruction of the cells cytoskeleton which in turn leads to the death of the cell as it can no longer maintain homeostasis.

==== Enterotoxin ====
This toxin (CPE) causes food poisoning. It alters intracellular claudin tight junctions in gut epithelial cells. This pore-forming toxin also can bind to human ileal and colonic epithelium in vitro and necrotize it. Through the caspase-3 pathway, this toxin can cause apoptosis of affected cells. This toxin is linked to type F strains, but has also been found to be produced by certain types of C, D, and E strains.

=== Other toxins ===
TpeL is a toxin found in type B, C, and G strains. It is in the same protein family as &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin A. It does not appear important in the pathogenesis of types B and C infections, but may contribute to virulence in type G strains. It glycosylates Rho and Ras GTPases, disrupting host cell signaling.

==Infection==
Tissue necrosis, bacteremia, emphysematous cholecystitis, and gas gangrene, also known as clostridial myonecrosis, have been linked to infections associated with &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. Research suggests that &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is capable of engaging in polymicrobial anaerobic infections.

&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is a common cause of food poisoning in the United States. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; produces spores, and when these spores are consumed, they produce a toxin that causes diarrhea. Foods cooked in large batches and held at unsafe temperatures (between 40 °F and 140 °F) are the source of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; food poisoning outbreaks. Meats such as poultry, beef, and pork are commonly linked to &quot;C. perfringens&quot; food poisoning. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; can proliferate in foods that are improperly stored due to the spore&#x27;s ability to survive normal cooking temperatures. The type A toxin of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, also known as the CPA is responsible for food poisoning.

&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is the most common bacterial agent for gas gangrene. Gas gangrene is induced by α-toxin that embeds itself into the plasma membrane of cells and disrupts normal cellular function by altering membrane structure. Some symptoms include blisters, tachycardia, swelling, and jaundice.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; is most commonly known for foodborne illness but can translocate from a gastrointestinal source into the bloodstream which causes bacteremia. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; bacteremia can lead to toxin-mediated intravascular hemolysis and septic shock. This is rare as it makes up less than 1% of bloodstream isolates but is highly fatal with a reported mortality rate of 27% to 58%.

&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; food poisoning can also lead to another disease known as enteritis necroticans or clostridial necrotizing enteritis, (also known as pigbel); this is caused by &quot;C. perfringens&quot; type C. This infection is often fatal. Large numbers of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; grow in the intestines and secrete exotoxin. This exotoxin causes necrosis of the intestines, varying levels of hemorrhaging, and perforation of the intestine. Inflammation usually occurs in sections of the jejunum, midsection of the small intestine. Perfringolysin O (&quot;pfoA&quot;)-positive &quot;C. perfringens&quot; strains were also associated with the rapid onset of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.

A strain of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; might be implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) nascent (Pattern III) lesions. Tests in mice found that two strains of intestinal &quot;C. perfringens&quot; that produced epsilon toxins (ETX) caused MS-like damage in the brain, and earlier work had identified this strain of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; in a human with MS. MS patients were found to be 10 times more immune-reactive to the epsilon toxin than healthy people.

Tissue gas occurs when &quot;C. perfringens&quot; infects corpses. It causes extremely accelerated decomposition and can only be stopped by embalming the corpse. Tissue gas most commonly occurs to those who have died from gangrene, large decubitus ulcers, necrotizing fasciitis or to those who had soil, feces, or water contaminated with &quot;C. perfringens&quot; forced into an open wound.

== Clinical Manifestations ==
&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; infections can lead to various clinical manifestations, ranging from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to life-threatening conditions. The most common presentation is food poisoning, characterized by acute abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, in some cases, vomiting, typically occurring 6 to 24 hours after the ingestion of contaminated food. Unlike many other foodborne illnesses, fever is usually absent. Symptoms are usually self-limiting and resolve within 24 to 48 hours; however, severe dehydration can occur in cases of significant fluid loss. Symptoms of dehydration include dry mouth, decreased urine output, dizziness, and fatigue. Severe symptoms such as diarrhea that persists for more than 48 hours, the inability to keep fluids down, or signs of severe dehydration may necessitate medical attention. Most people are able to recover from &quot;C. perfringens&quot; food poisoning without treatment. However, people who experience diarrhea are usually instructed to drink water or rehydration solutions.

Gas gangrene caused by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is characterized by severe symptoms, including intense pain at the injury site, fever, rapid heart rate, sweating, and anxiety. The affected area may show signs of swelling, discoloration (ranging from pale to dark red or purplish), and large, discolored blisters filled with foul-smelling fluid. As the toxins spread, skin and muscle tissue are rapidly destroyed, leading to large areas of dead tissue, gas pockets under the skin (crepitus), and possible renal failure due to red blood cell destruction. Sepsis and septic shock may also occur, which can be fatal.

Necrotizing enteritis caused by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; presents with a wide range of symptoms, which can vary in severity. The clinical signs range from mild diarrhea to more severe manifestations such as intense abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stools, and even septic shock. In the most serious cases, the infection can lead to death.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; food poisoning relies on laboratory detection of the bacterium or its toxin in either a patient’s stool sample or contaminated food linked to the illness. A positive stool culture would have growth of at least 10 cfu/g of C. &quot;perfringens&quot;. Stool studies include WBCs, ova, and parasites in order to rule out other potential etiologies. ELISA testing is used to detect the CPA toxin. Diagnosing &quot;C. perfringens&quot; food poisoning is relatively uncommon for several reasons. Most individuals with this foodborne illness do not seek medical care or submit a stool sample for testing, and routine testing for &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is not typically performed in clinical laboratories. Additionally, public health laboratories generally conduct testing for this pathogen only in the event of an outbreak.

The diagnosis of gas gangrene typically involves several methods to confirm the infection. Imaging techniques such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs can reveal gas bubbles or tissue changes indicative of muscle damage. Additionally, bacterial staining or culture of fluid taken from the wound helps identify &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; and other bacteria responsible for the infection. In some cases, a biopsy is performed, where a sample of the affected tissue is analyzed for signs of damage or necrosis.

The diagnosis of clostridial necrotizing enteritis is primarily based on the patient&#x27;s clinical symptoms, which can include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Additionally, confirmation of the presence of &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; type C toxin in stool samples is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

== Epidemiology ==
&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is responsible for an estimated 966,000 cases annually, or about 10.3% of all foodborne illnesses in which a pathogen is identified. Transmission typically occurs when food contaminated with &quot;C. perfringens&quot; spores is consumed, allowing the bacteria to produce a toxin in the intestines that causes diarrhea. Outbreaks are often associated with foods cooked in large batches, such as poultry, meat, and gravy, and held at unsafe temperatures between 40-140 °F, which allows the bacteria to thrive. These outbreaks tend to occur in settings where large groups are served, such as hospitals, school cafeterias, prisons, nursing homes, and catered events. In most cases, &quot;C. perfringens&quot; infection causes mild symptoms, including watery diarrhea and mild abdominal cramps, with symptoms typically appearing 8 to 12 hours after consuming contaminated food and resolving within 24 hours. About 90% of affected individuals recover without seeking medical attention, usually within two days. However, vulnerable groups such as the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised individuals face a higher risk of severe complications like dehydration, which can lead to more serious illness or, in rare cases, death. Each year, &quot;C. perfringens&quot; infections result in approximately 438 hospitalizations and 26 deaths, accounting for 0.8% of foodborne illness-related hospitalizations and 1.9% of associated deaths. Outbreaks are most common in November and December, coinciding with holiday foods like turkey and roast beef. The economic burden of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is significant, estimated at $342.7 million annually, including $53.2 million in medical costs, $64.3 million in productivity loss, and $225 million related to fatalities.

Clostridial necrotizing enteritis is rare in the United States; typically, it occurs in populations with a higher risk. Data show that of the 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States each year, only about 11% are caused by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;. &quot;Risk factors for enteritis necroticans include protein-deficient diet, unhygienic food preparation, sporadic feasts of meat (after long periods of a protein-deficient diet), diets containing large amounts of trypsin inhibitors (sweet potatoes), and areas prone to infection of the parasite &quot;Ascaris&quot; (produces a trypsin inhibitor). This disease is contracted in populations living in New Guinea, parts of Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia.

Risk factors for gas gangrene include severe injuries, abdominal surgeries, and underlying health conditions such as colon cancer, diseases of the blood vessels, diabetes, and diverticulitis. However, the most common way to get gas gangrene is through a traumatic injury. In the United States, there is only about 1000 cases of gas gangrene per year. When addressed with adequate care, gas gangrene has a mortality rate of 20-30% but has a mortality rate of 100% if left untreated.

== Food poisoning incidents ==
On May 7, 2010, 42 residents and 12 staff members at a Louisiana (USA) state psychiatric hospital were affected and experienced vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Three patients died within 24 hours. The outbreak was linked to chicken which was cooked a day before it was served and was not cooled down according to hospital guidelines. The outbreak affected 31% of the residents of the hospital and 69% of the staff who ate the chicken. How many of the affected residents ate the chicken is unknown.

In May 2011, a man died after allegedly eating food contaminated with the bacteria on a transatlantic American Airlines flight. The man&#x27;s wife and daughter were suing American and LSG Sky Chefs, the German company that prepared the inflight food.

In December 2012, a 46-year-old woman died two days after eating a Christmas Day meal at a pub in Hornchurch, Essex, England. She was among about 30 people to fall ill after eating the meal. Samples taken from the victims contained &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. The hotel manager and the cook were jailed for forging cooking records relating to the cooking of the turkey.

In December 2014, 87-year-old Bessie Scott died three days after eating a church potluck supper in Nackawic, New Brunswick, Canada. Over 30 other people reported signs of gastrointestinal illness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The province&#x27;s acting chief medical officer says, &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; is the bacteria [sic] that most likely caused the woman&#x27;s death.

In October 2016, 66-year-old Alex Zdravich died four days after eating an enchilada, burrito, and taco at Agave Azul in West Lafayette, Indiana, United States. Three others who dined the same day reported signs of foodborne illness, which were consistent with the symptoms and rapid onset of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; infection. They later tested positive for the presence of the bacteria, but the leftover food brought home by Zdravich tested negative.

In November 2016, food contaminated with &quot;C. perfringens&quot; caused three individuals to die, and another 22 to be sickened, after a Thanksgiving luncheon hosted by a church in Antioch, California, United States.

In January 2017, a mother and her son sued a restaurant in Rochester, New York, United States, as they and 260 other people were sickened after eating foods contaminated with &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. &quot;Officials from the Monroe County Department of Public Health closed down the Golden Ponds after more than a fourth of its Thanksgiving Day guests became ill. An inspection revealed a walk-in refrigerator with food spills and mold, a damaged gasket preventing the door from closing, and mildew growing inside.&quot;

In July 2018, 647 people reported symptoms after eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant in Powell, Ohio, United States. Stool samples tested by the CDC tested positive for &quot;C. perfringens&quot;.

In November 2018, approximately 300 people in Concord, North Carolina, United States, were sickened by food at a church barbecue that tested positive for &quot;C. perfringens&quot;.

In 2021, dozens of hospital workers in Alaska were sick and it was traced back to a Cubano Sandwich. Health officials wrote that almost all symptoms resolved within 24 hours. No one who ate the food reportedly needed hospitalization. It is rare for Alaska to see an outbreak with this magnitude when it&#x27;s not associated with some sort of national food borne illness.

==Prevention==
Preventing &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; contamination and growth involves careful food handling, proper cooking, and appropriate storage practices. Most foods, especially beef and chicken, can be protected by cooking them to the recommended internal temperatures. Using a kitchen thermometer is the most reliable way to check that meats reach safe cooking temperatures. As a general rule, food should be avoided if it smells, tastes, looks off, or has been left out at unsafe temperatures for a long period of time.

&quot;C. perfringens&quot; spores can multiply within a temperature range of 59 °F (15 °C) to 122 °F (50 °C). To prevent bacterial growth, leftovers should be refrigerated within two hours of preparation, with their temperature chilled down to below 40 °F (4 °C). Large portions of food that contain meat, should be divided into smaller containers before refrigeration to ensure even cooling. Before serving leftovers, they should be reheated to at least 165 °F (74 °C) to destroy any bacteria that may have grown during storage.

High-risk foods, such as canned vegetables, smoked or cured meats, and salted or smoked fish, require additional attention. Improper processing or storage can allow bacteria to grow and produce dangerous toxins. Signs of contamination, such as unusual odors, changes in texture, or bulging cans (also known as &quot;bombage&quot;), indicate food spoilage and should be disposed.

Preventing gas gangrene involves taking precautions to avoid bacterial infections. Healthcare providers follow strict protocols to prevent infections, including those caused by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;. To reduce the risk of gas gangrene, individuals should clean wounds thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention for deep or uncleanable wounds. It is also essential to monitor injuries for changes in skin condition or the onset of severe pain. Wearing protective gear when engaging in activities like biking or motorcycling can help prevent injury. Additionally, working with healthcare providers to manage underlying conditions that affect circulation or weaken the immune system can further reduce the risk of infection.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; infections depends on the type and severity of the condition. For severe infections, such as gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), the primary approach involves surgical debridement of the affected area. This procedure removes devitalized tissue where bacteria grow, which limits the spread of the infection. Antimicrobial therapy is usually started at the same time, with penicillin being the most commonly used drug. However, &quot;C. perfringens&quot; shows different resistance patterns with about 20% of strains being resistant to clindamycin, and 10% being resistant to metronidazole. &quot;C. perfringens&quot; is often more susceptible to vancomycin when compared to other pathogenic &quot;Clostridia&quot;, making it an alternative option for treatment in some cases.

Therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), may also be used for severe clostridial tissue infections. HBOT increases oxygen delivery to infected tissues, creating an environment that inhibits the growth of anaerobic bacteria like &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. While not commonly used, HBOT can be beneficial in certain cases.

For foodborne illness caused by &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, treatment is typically unnecessary. Most people who suffer from food poisoning caused by &quot;C. perfringens&quot; usually fight off the illness without the need of any antibiotics. Extra fluids should be drank consistently until diarrhea dissipates.

== Research ==
&quot;C. perfringens&quot; has shown increasing multidrug resistance, particularly in strains from humans and animals. High resistance levels were found with antibiotics such as tetracycline, erythromycin, and sulfonamides. Genetic factors, misuse of antibiotics, and bacterial evolution are the cause of this issue. This highlights the importance of finding new treatment strategies.

Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) have been used to find the genetic diversity of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;. These methods have identified 195 distinct sequence types grouped into 25 clonal complexes from 322 genomes. Phylogenetic groups were also found in multiple different hosts and environmental sources. This highlights the bacteria&#x27;s transmission potential and adaptability across species.

<text>Louis Jacques Thénard (4 May 177721 June 1857) was a French chemist.

==Life==
He was born in a farm cottage near Nogent-sur-Seine in the Champagne district
the son of a farm worker. In the post-Revolution French educational system, most boys received scholarships for education up to age 14, and this allowed him to be educated at the academy at Sens. He then went at the age of sixteen to study pharmacy in Paris. There he attended the lectures of Antoine François Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. He was allowed into Vauquelin&#x27;s laboratory even though he was unable to pay the monthly fee of 20 francs, due to the requests of Vauquelin&#x27;s sisters. But his progress was so rapid that in two or three years he was able to take his master&#x27;s place at the lecture-table, and Fourcroy and Vauquelin were so satisfied with his performance that they procured for him a school appointment in 1797 as a teacher of chemistry, and in 1798 one as at the École Polytechnique.

==Career==
In 1804 Vauquelin resigned his professorship at the Collège de France and successfully used his influence to obtain the appointment for Thénard, who six years later, after Fourcroy&#x27;s death, was further elected to the chairs of chemistry at the École Polytechnique and the Faculté des Sciences. He also succeeded Fourcroy as member of the academy. In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1825 he received the title of baron from Charles X, and in 1832 Louis Philippe made him a peer of France. From 1827 to 1830 he represented the &quot;département&quot; of Yonne in the chamber of deputies, and as vice-president of the , he exercised a great influence on scientific education in France. He died in Paris on 21 June 1857. A statue was erected to his memory at Sens in 1861, and in 1865 the name of his native village was changed to La Louptière-Thénard.

Above all things Thénard was a teacher; as he himself said, the professor, the assistants, the laboratory — everything must be sacrificed to the students. Like most great teachers he published a textbook, and his (4 vols., Paris, 1813–16), which served as a standard for a quarter of a century, perhaps did even more for the advance of chemistry than his numerous original discoveries.

==Research==
Soon after his appointment as at the École Polytechnique he began a lifelong friendship with Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and the two carried out many research projects together. For their research, Gay-Lussac and Thénard would receive 30,000 francs from Napoleon in the third and last installment of the Galvanism Prize.

Careful analysis led him to dispute some of Claude Louis Berthollet&#x27;s theoretical views regarding the composition of the metallic oxides, and he also showed Berthollet&#x27;s &quot;zoonic acid&quot; to be impure acetic acid (1802). In response, Berthollet invited him to become a member of the Society of Arcueil.

In 1806 he analysed the chemical composition of the Alais meteorite, which fell in Alès on 15 March 1806. This was the first carbonaceous chondrite to be discovered. Thénard found a high carbon content of 2.5 per cent.

His first original paper (1799) was on the compounds of arsenic and antimony with oxygen and sulphur. In 1807, he began important research into ethers. His researches on sebacic acid (1802) and on bile (1807) deserve mention as well, as does his discovery of hydrogen peroxide (1818). In 1799 he developed the pigment known as Thénard&#x27;s blue in response to a request by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal for a cheap colouring matter.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<text>STS-93 in 1999 marked the 95th launch of the Space Shuttle, the 26th launch of &quot;Columbia&quot;, and the 21st night launch of a Space Shuttle. Eileen Collins became the first female shuttle Commander on this flight. Its primary mission was to launch the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the heaviest payload ever carried by the Space Shuttle system, at .

STS-93 would be Columbia&#x27;s last mission until March 2002. During the interim, &quot;Columbia&quot; would be out of service for upgrading and would only fly again on STS-109. The launch was originally scheduled for 20 July, but it was aborted at T−7 seconds. The successful launch of the flight occurred three days later.

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Problems during ascent==
During the main engine ignition sequence, a gold pin used to plug an oxidizer post in the Space Shuttle&#x27;s number three (right) engine came loose and was violently ejected, striking the engine nozzle&#x27;s inner surface and tearing open three cooling tubes containing hydrogen. These ruptures resulted in a leak upstream of the main combustion chamber. This anomalous event and the automatic response to the leak by the right engine&#x27;s controller did not violate any launch commit criteria and liftoff proceeded normally. However, approximately 5 seconds after liftoff, an electrical short disabled the center engine&#x27;s primary digital control unit, DCU-A, and the right engine&#x27;s backup unit, DCU-B. The center and right engines continued to operate on their remaining DCUs for the rest of powered flight to orbit. The redundant set of DCUs in each engine controller saved &quot;Columbia&quot; and her crew from potential catastrophe, as shutdown of two engines at that point in the flight would have resulted in a very risky contingency abort with no guarantee of success. The electrical short was later discovered to have been caused by poorly routed wiring, which had rubbed on an exposed screw head. This wiring issue led to a program-wide inspection of the wiring in all orbiters.

Because of the leak in the right engine, its controller sensed a decrease in power or thrust—measured indirectly as main combustion chamber pressure—since the leaking hydrogen was not being burned in the SSME&#x27;s two pre-burners or the main combustion chamber. To bring the engine back up to the commanded thrust level, the controller opened the oxidizer valves a bit more than normal. The hydrogen leak and increased oxidizer consumption resulted in the right engine deviating from the desired oxygen/hydrogen mixing ratio of 6.03 and running hotter than normal. The increased oxidizer consumption during ascent resulted in a premature shutdown of all three engines near the end of the projected burn due to low liquid-oxygen level sensed in the External Tank. Though the premature shutdown resulted in a velocity lower than targeted, the vehicle safely achieved its intended orbit and completed the mission as planned. This incident brought on a maintenance practice change that required damaged oxidizer posts to be removed and replaced as opposed to being intentionally plugged, as was the practice beforehand.

Three days previously, in the first launch attempt, the launch was stopped at T−7 seconds, just prior to the SSMEs&#x27; ignition sequence, due to a senior console operator manually triggering a cutoff in the countdown. It was later determined that the console operator, monitoring the hydrogen gas concentration in the Space Shuttle&#x27;s aft compartment, where the three SSMEs are located, saw a hydrogen increase spike above the Launch Commit Criteria redline, for a single sample just prior to main engine start. Subsequent troubleshooting and analysis indicated the most likely cause was the mass spectrometer instrument experienced a data anomaly in the high vacuum region of the instrument for a single sample. The system performance was nominal prior to the cut-off and during subsequent launch attempts.

==Mission objectives==
The primary objective of the STS-93 mission was to deploy the Chandra X-ray Observatory (formerly the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility) with its Inertial Upper Stage booster. At its launch, Chandra was the most sophisticated X-ray observatory ever built. It is designed to observe X-rays from high energy regions of the universe, such as hot gas in the remnants of exploded stars.

Other payloads on STS-93 included the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLEX), the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS), the Gelation of Sols: Applied Microgravity Research (GOSAMR) experiment, the Space Tissue Loss – B (STL-B) experiment, a Light mass Flexible Solar Array Hinge (LFSAH), the Cell Culture Module (CCM), the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment – II (SAREX – II), EarthKAM, Plant Growth Investigations in Microgravity (PGIM), the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), the Micro-Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS), and the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC).

The Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLEX) payload activity researched the source of Very High Frequency (VHF) radar echoes caused by the orbiter and its OMS engine firings. The Principal Investigator (PI) used the collected data to examine the effects of orbital kinetic energy on ionospheric irregularities and to understand the processes that take place with the venting of exhaust materials.


The Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging system (SWUIS) was based around a Maksutov-design ultraviolet (UV) telescope and a UV-sensitive, image-intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera that frames at video frame rates. Scientists can obtain sensitive photometric measurements of astronomical targets.

The objective Gelation of Sols: Applied Microgravity Research (GOSAMR) experiment was to investigate the influence of microgravity on the processing of gelled sols. In particular, the purpose was to demonstrate that composite ceramic precursors composed of large particulates and small colloidal sols can be produced in space with more structural uniformity.

The focus of the Space Tissue Loss – B (STL-B) experiment was direct video observation of cells in culture through the use of a video microscope imaging system with the objective of demonstrating near real-time interactive operations to detect and induce cellular responses.

The Light mass Flexible Solar Array Hinge (LFSAH) payload consisted of several hinges fabricated from shape memory alloys. Shape memory deployment hinges offered controlled shockless deployment of solar arrays and other spacecraft appendages. LFSAH demonstrated this deployment capability for a number of hinge configurations.

The objectives of the Cell Culture Module (CCM) were to validate models for muscle, bone, and endothelial cell biochemical and functional loss induced by microgravity stress; to evaluate cytoskeleton, metabolism, membrane integrity and protease activity in target cells; and to test tissue loss medications.

The Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX-II) demonstrated the feasibility of amateur short-wave radio contacts between the shuttle and ground-based amateur radio operators. SAREX also served as an educational opportunity for schools around the world to learn about space by speaking directly to astronauts aboard the shuttle via amateur radio.

The EarthKAM payload conducted Earth observations using the Electronic Still Camera (ESC) installed in the overhead starboard window of the Aft Flight Deck.

The Plant Growth Investigations in Microgravity (PGIM) payload experiment used plants to monitor the space flight environment for stressful conditions that affect plant growth. Because plants cannot move away from stressful conditions, they have developed mechanisms that monitor their environment and direct effective physiological responses to harmful conditions.

The Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payload hardware allowed for sample processing and stowage functions. The Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus – Isothermal Containment Module (GBA-ICM) was temperature controlled to maintain a preset temperature environment, controlled the activation and termination of the experiment samples, and provided an interface for crew interaction, control and data transfer.

The Micro-Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS) payload examined the performance, under launch, microgravity, and reentry conditions of a suite of MEMS devices. These devices included accelerometers, gyroscopes, and environmental and chemical sensors. The MEMS payload was self-contained and required activation and deactivation only.

The Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) payload was designed to investigate the effects of space flight on small arthropod animals and plant specimens. The flight crew was available at regular intervals to monitor and control payload/experiment operations.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landing at Kennedy Space Center marked the twelfth night landing in the Shuttle program&#x27;s history. Five had been at Edwards Air Force Base in California and the rest KSC. To date, there had been 19 consecutive landings at KSC and 25 of the last 26 had been there.

==Launch attempts==

==Special cargo==
In 2001, &quot;Coin World&quot; reported the revelation (via a FOIA document request) that the United States Mint had struck 39 examples of the 2000 Sacagawea dollar in gold in June 1999 at the West Point Mint. The planchets came from specially prepared ½ troy-oz $25 American Gold Eagle Bullion Planchets. Why they were struck is not known; speculation is that this was an attempt by the mint to offer &quot;Premium&quot; collectibles in conjunction with the newly released Sacagawea dollar in 2000.

Twenty-seven were soon melted and the remaining 12 were on board Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; for the July 1999 STS-93 mission. Two examples then popped up at two separate events; one during a Private Congressional Dinner in August 1999, and another example at the Official First-Strike ceremonies in November. The coins remained at Mint Headquarters under lock and key until they were transferred in 2001 to Fort Knox. The strikes are considered to be illegal due to the Coinage regulations in place.

In 2007, the Mint announced it would for the first time publicly display the 12 space-flown gold dollars at the American Numismatic Association&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair of Money in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==Wake-up calls==
Sleeping shuttle astronauts were often awakened with a short piece of music, a tradition that began during the Gemini and Apollo missions. Each track was specially chosen, sometimes by their families, and usually had a special meaning to an individual member of the crew or was applicable to their daily activities.

<text>Melchior Hoffman (or Hofmann c. 1495c. 1543) was a German Anabaptist, radical lay preacher and reformer in northern Europe. He began his career as an outspoken proponent of Lutheranism but evolved his own theological voice influenced by late medieval mysticism, Joachimite apocalypticism, and the Anabaptist movement. He is credited with introducing Anabaptism to the Low Countries.

==Life==
Hoffman was born at Schwäbisch Hall in southwest Germany before 1500. His biographers usually give his surname as &quot;Hofmann&quot;; in his printed works it sometimes appears as &quot;Hoffman&quot;, and in his manuscripts as &quot;Hoffmann&quot;.

He was without scholarly training, and first appeared as a furrier in Livonia. Attracted by Luther&#x27;s teachings, he came forward as a lay preacher, combining business travels with a religious mission. He worked as a lay preacher in the cities of Wolmar (from 1523), Dorpat and Reval. In Dorpat he became involved in an iconoclastic revolt, and the magistrates obliged him to go to Wittenberg to obtain Luther&#x27;s approval of his preaching. After his return to Dorpat he was involved in more controversy and forced to leave the city.

After the same thing happened in Reval, he decided to go to Stockholm, Sweden, where he arrived in the autumn of 1526. Here too he was involved in religious disturbances and so left Sweden again.

After a short stay in Lübeck he made his way to Denmark, where he found favour with King Frederick I, and was appointed by royal ordinance to preach the Gospel at Kiel. He was probably the first printer in the city. He was extravagant in his denunciations, and developed a Zwinglian view of the Eucharist.

Luther himself was alarmed at this. At a colloquy of preachers in Flensburg on (April 8, 1529), Hoffman, John Campanus and others were put on their defence. Hoffman maintained (against the &quot;magic&quot; of the Lutheran interpretation) that the function of the Eucharist, like that of preaching, is nothing more than an appeal for spiritual union with Christ. Refusing to retract, he was banished.

Making his way to Strasbourg in June 1529, he was well received, until his Anabaptist tendencies became apparent. He joined with the Anabaptists of the city, and, according to Estep, was rebaptized in April 1530.
In May he travelled to East Frisia, where he established churches and baptized about 300 people. He was in relations with Kaspar Schwenkfeld and with Andreas Karlstadt, but assumed a prophetic role of his own. In 1532 he founded a community at Emden, securing a large following of artisans.

Because of the prophecy of an old man foretelling six months in prison for him, he returned in the spring of the following year to Strasbourg, where there is reference to his wife and child. He gained from his study of Apocalypse the belief that the Lord would return there in 1533 and received a vision of &quot;resurrections&quot; of apostolic Christianity, first under John Hus, and now under himself. The year 1533 was to inaugurate the new era; Strasbourg was to be the seat of the New Jerusalem.

When however he prophesied that the return of Christ would be preceded by a purging of the ungodly, Hoffman was seen as a revolutionary. Under examination, he denied that he had made common cause with the Anabaptists and claimed to be no prophet but a mere witness of the Most High, but nevertheless refused the articles of faith proposed to him by the provincial synod.

Hoffman&#x27;s failed prophecy of the return of Christ contributed significantly to the Münster Rebellion (1533–1534), of which he is seen as one of the authors. Two of his followers, Jan van Matthijs and Jan van Leiden, proclaimed that Hoffman was wrong on the questions of the exact time and place, where Christ would return and reign, and named Münster as the correct location.

As a consequence of the terror inspired by the rebellion and its savage suppression, Hoffman, together with Claus Frey, another Anabaptist, was detained in prison. Although the synod made a further effort to reclaim him in 1539, he stayed there for the rest of his life, until his death in 1543.

==Teachings and influence==
Hoffman was important in at least one aspect of the development of the Mennonites. He adopted the views of Schwenkfeld concerning the incarnation of Jesus, and taught what has been called the &quot;heavenly flesh of Christ&quot;. Menno Simons accepted this view, probably received from the &quot;peaceful Melchiorites&quot; Obbe and Dirk Philips, and it became the general belief of Dutch Anabaptists in the first century of their existence.

Hoffman wrote a commentary on the Book of Daniel in 1526. Two of his publications with similar titles from 1530&quot;Weissagung aus heiliger gotlicher geschrift&quot; (&quot;Prophecy from Holy and Divine Scripture&quot;) and &quot;Prophecey oder Weissagung vsz warer heiliger gotlicher schrifft&quot; (&quot;Prophecy from True, Holy and Divine Scripture&quot;)are noteworthy as having influenced Menno Simons and David Joris. Bock treats him as an antitrinitarian, on grounds which Robert Wallace deems inconclusive. Trechsel includes him among pioneers of some of the positions of Servetus.

His followers were known as Hoffmanites or Melchiorites.

<text>Jean-Antoine Chaptal, comte de Chanteloup (; 5 June 1756 – 29 July 1832) was a French chemist, physician, agronomist, industrialist, statesman, educator and philanthropist. 

Chaptal was involved in early industrialization in France under Napoleon and during the Bourbon Restoration. He was a founder and the first president of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. He was an organizer of industrial expositions held in Paris. He compiled a study surveying the condition and needs of French industry in the early 1800s. Chaptal published practical essays on the uses of chemistry. He was an industrial producer of hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and was sought after as a technical consultant for the manufacture of gunpowder. Chaptal published works which drew on Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s theoretical chemistry to make advances in wine-making. Chaptal promoted adding sugar to increase the final alcohol content of wines, now referred to as &quot;chaptalization&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Chaptal was born in Nojaret (Lozère) in southwestern France, the youngest son of small landowners, Antoine Chaptal and Françoise Brunel. Chaptal&#x27;s record at the area &quot;collèges&quot; of Mende and Rodez encouraged his uncle, Claude Chaptal who was a physician at Montpellier, to finance him through medical school at the University of Montpellier, 1774–1776. 

After receiving his degree of doctor of medicine, he persuaded his uncle to continue his support for postgraduate study in medicine and chemistry at Paris. He attended courses on chemistry at the &quot;École de Médicine&quot; given by Jean-Baptiste-Michel Bucquet. He returned to Montpellier in 1780 to a salaried chair in chemistry at the university. Chaptal then wrote &quot;Mémoires de chimie&quot; (1781) reporting his early studies in chemistry. 

In 1781, he married Anne-Marie Lajard, the daughter of a rich cotton merchant at Montpellier. With his wife&#x27;s dowry, and capital supplied by his uncle, he then established a chemical factory at Montpellier. The enterprise involved manufacturing sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric and other acids, alum, white lead and soda, among other substances. By 1787 Montpellier became a center of innovation for the production of industrial chemicals in France. 

Chaptal reported regularly on his studies in chemistry applied to industry and agriculture for the &quot;Société Royale des Sciences de Montpellier&quot;. He communicated with the Controller General&#x27;s department in Paris in 1782 regarding his projects for bottle-making, dyeing and the manufacture of artificial soda. His articles were published by the &quot;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot; and in the &quot;Annales de chimie&quot;.

In 1790, Chaptal published the scientific treatise, &quot;Elements of Chemistry&quot; which introduced the term &quot;nitrogen&quot;.

===Revolution===
Reflecting later in his life on the Revolution in France, Chaptal wrote: &quot;In the widespread confusion and flood of all passions, the wise man will consider carefully the role he must play; it will appear to him equally dangerous in the midst of such agitation to remain either inactive or to participate.&quot;

Chaptal initially welcomed the Revolution. But, in 1793, he led opposition in Montpellier against the perceived extremism of the Committee of Public Safety of the National Convention in Paris. As a consequence, he was arrested, imprisoned, and in danger of being guillotined. Fortunately for Chaptal, his value to the nation as an industrial chemist was deemed sufficient to excuse his politics, in part because the revolutionary armies required gunpowder.

In the Spring of 1794, by order of Lazare Carnot, the Minister of War, Chaptal was charged with the management of the major gunpowder factory at Grenelle in Paris. Chaptal recounts in his memoirs how, with the help of his fellow scientists—Berthollet, Fourcroy, Guyton and others—he introduced new and more rapid methods for refining potassium nitrate (at Saint-Germain-des-Prés) and produced increased amounts of gunpowder at Grenelle.

After Thermidor (July 1794), Chaptal spent about four years mainly in Montpellier teaching at the medical school and rebuilding his chemicals industry. He estimated his losses because of the Revolution at 500,000 francs, almost all of his fortune. In 1798 he decided to move to Paris, leaving his business enterprises in Montpellier to his long-time partner, Étienne Bérard. Captal was elected to the &quot;Institut&quot; (24 May 1798) and became a member of the editorial board of the &quot;Annales de chimie&quot;. He then began to build up a second large chemicals industry near Paris at Ternes, an enterprise managed after 1808 by his son, Jean-Baptiste Chaptal (1782–1833).

By 1795, at the newly established &quot;École Polytechnique&quot; in Paris, Chaptal shared the teaching of courses in pure and applied chemistry with Claude-Louis Berthollet. In 1798, Chaptal was elected a member of the prestigious Chemistry Section of the &quot;Institut de France&quot;, he became president of the section in 1802. Napoleon appointed him Minister of Interior on November 6th, 1800.

===Consulate, Empire, and Restoration===
Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) lead to the establishment of the Consulate (1799–1804) and opened up a new career for Chaptal. Jean-Jacques Cambacérès was one of Chaptal&#x27;s friends from Montpellier. There was also Claude-Louis Berthollet, by then a close friend of Napoleon, who called Berthollet &quot;my chemist&quot;: they were on the Egyptian Expedition together in 1798–1799. Berthollet could vouch for Chaptal&#x27;s remarkable abilities and dedication to using science for the advancement of agriculture, commerce and industry. Napoleon was &quot;prejudiced in favour of men of science&quot; for positions in his government. Napoleon&#x27;s first Minister of Interior (1799) was Berthollet&#x27;s friend, Pierre-Simon Laplace, a scientist and mathematician and a poor administrator. He was replaced after six weeks by Napoleon&#x27;s younger brother, Lucien Bonaparte. Chaptal was then moved into position, first with appointment to Napoleon&#x27;s Council of State, then acting Minister of Interior (6 November 1800), and finally confirmed in the position (21 January 1801). Chaptal remained in this office until his resignation on 6 August 1804.

When Chaptal took over at the Ministry of Interior, ten years of Revolution and war had produced much disruption. Chaptal&#x27;s work focussed on reconstruction and reorganization across multiple accumulated civic and infrastructure problems. Chaptal worked to design and implement a new administrative structure and a new primary and secondary educational system. Chaptal created a Bureau of Statistics for his ministry to gather basic data from each of the departments on population and the condition of agriculture, commerce and industry. Chaptal sponsored the formation of Councils of Agriculture, Arts and Commerce in each of France&#x27;s departments (1801); Chambers of Commerce were reestablished in 23 of the largest cities (1802) and Chambres Consultatives des Arts et Manufactures were organized in 150 of the smaller urban areas (1803).

Chaptal&#x27;s believed that government should &quot;protect and encourage industry, open new markets for its products and defend it against undue foreign competition.&quot; Chaptal was an admirer of Adam Smith&#x27;s laissez-faire doctrines, but also believed in state sponsorship of industrialization. He believed that his ministry should play an active role in forging a new industrial order capable of competing with England. In his approach, scientists, entrepreneurs, artisans, workers, farmers and government officials would work together and government would mediate private interests for the public good.

Chaptal was proud of the 1801 establishment of the Société d&#x27;Encouragement pour l&#x27;industrie nationale, patterned after the successful English society founded in London in 1754, the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. Chaptal was the president of the new French association. The society was financed by member subscriptions. It offered prizes and published a &quot;Bulletin&quot; to encourage discoveries useful to industry and new products. Closely related to this initiative, Chaptal resumed François de Neufchâteau&#x27;s plan for periodic expositions in Paris of the products of industry. The first Exposition des produits de l&#x27;industrie française had been held on the Champs-de-Mars in 1798 (110 exhibits); under Chaptal&#x27;s guidance, the number of exhibitors increased for the next three expositions held at the Louvre in 1801, 1802 and 1806. Napoleon was in attendance with Chaptal for the distribution of awards at the 1801 exposition (229 exhibits).

Emmanuel-Anatole Chaptal (1861–1943) wrote that his great-grandfather was &quot;the voice of commerce, agriculture and industry&quot; for Napoleon. Chaptal resigned as Minister of Interior on August 6, 1804. Napoleon awarded Chaptal the Legion of Honor and an important place in the Senate. Chaptal wrote to Napoleon that he wanted to return to his scientific endeavors. 

In 1802, Chaptal purchased the Château de Chanteloup and its extensive grounds in Touraine, near Amboise. He raised merino sheep and experimented there in his later years on a model farm for the cultivation of sugar beets. At Chanteloup, Chaptal wrote his applied science reports, entertained notables and made himself available for consultations. He had chemical factories there at Ternes and Nanterre. Chaptal was doing well producing a variety of industrial acids, alum and soda. In 1804 Chaptal bought a new home in Paris, the Hôtel de Mailly, at No.70 rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain. He began to frequent meetings of the Society of Arcueil, an association of scientists who gathered at the homes of Berthollet and Laplace in Arcueil. Berthollet was Chaptal&#x27;s close friend for forty years. The meetings at his home at Arcueil were a way for Chaptal to keep up-to-date with discoveries in pure science. Napoleon named Chaptal Count of the Empire (1808) and Count of Chanteloup (1810). 


Chaptal was called to Paris when the French economy experienced a downturn in 1810–1811. Napoleon brought in Chaptal as his key consultant for a special &quot;Conseil d&#x27;Administration du commerce et des manufactures&quot; (6 June 1810). The other members were the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs, plus the Director General of Customs, Jean-Baptiste Collin de Sussy, Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;&quot;douanier par excellence&quot;.&quot; In addition, two sixty-member advisory councils of leading manufacturers and merchants were organized (7 June 1810) and attached to the Ministry of Interior, then under Count Montalivet: a &quot;Conseil général des Manufactures&quot; and a &quot;Conseil général de Commerce.&quot; The advisory councils of manufacturers and merchants had no influence on Napoleon. Chaptal&#x27;s vision of a new industrial order in France that would bring scientists, business leaders and government officials together had to give way.

Chaptal was called back during the Hundred Days (March–June, 1815) to serve as Napoleon&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry. Shortly after, Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to St. Helena. Chaptal temporarily returned to his Chanteloup estate when Louis XVIII assumed the throne. Chaptal declined an invitation by the American consul to move to the United States of America. Chaptal&#x27;s turned over the management of his chemical industries to his son. At Chanteloup, Chaptal focused on leisure, writing and farming.

Chaptal eventually resumed his position as president of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry and organizer of industrial expositions (1819, 1823, 1827). In 1817 he published a lengthy memoir on the high price of coal in France that provoked a serious government inquiry into the coal tariff of 1816 and its benefits for the Anzin Coal Company in the Department of Nord. In 1818, with the Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, and Paris bankers Benjamin Delessert, Casimir Perier and others, Chaptal helped to found the first French savings bank, the Caisse d&#x27;Épargne et de Prévoyance de Paris. In 1819 he was appointed to the Restoration&#x27;s Chamber of Peers. 

With Joseph Degérando, Benjamin Delessert and Scipion Perier, Chaptal organized a society to improve primary school instruction (1815). He also helped found two important business schools in Paris, the École Speciale de Commerce (1816) and the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (1828). As a member of the Chamber of Peers, Chaptal supervised the budget of the Conservatory of Arts and Sciences. Chaptal was a member of national and international scientific societies.

In 1819 he was named by Louis XVIII to the Restoration&#x27;s Chamber of Peers. In 1819, Chaptal reflected on his career:

In the 1820s Chaptal&#x27;s son experienced financial ruin due to business speculations. To cover his son&#x27;s debts, Chaptal sold Chanteloup and his home in Paris. During his last years he resided in an apartment in Paris at No.8 rue Grenelle. In this decade, Chaptal wrote his 1823 study of the application of scientific principles to the cultivation of land, the &quot;Chemistry applied to agriculture&quot;.

===Death===
He lived long enough to witness the Revolution of 1830 that brought Louis Philippe I to the throne. He was 76 years old when he died in 1832. Chaptal was buried at the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. His name is one of the 72 names of famous French scientists engraved on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Place Chaptal in Mende, Lozère is named after Chaptal and features a statue dedicated to his memory. The Lycée Chaptal in Paris&#x27; 8th arrondissement is named in honour of Chaptal.

<text>The Faurisson affair was an academic controversy following publication of a book, &quot;Mémoire en défense&quot; (1980), by French professor Robert Faurisson, a Holocaust denier, and the inclusion of an essay by American linguist Noam Chomsky, entitled &quot;Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression&quot;, as an introduction to Faurisson&#x27;s book.

Faurisson has since been convicted under French law for his Holocaust denial on several occasions, including in October 2006, when he was sentenced to a three-month suspended sentence by the Paris correctional court, for denying the Holocaust on an Iranian TV channel.

The Faurisson affair damaged Chomsky&#x27;s reputation in France, a country he did not visit for almost thirty years following the affair. Translation of his political writings into French was delayed until the 2000s.

==Faurisson&#x27;s letters to &quot;Le Monde&quot;==
In December 1978 and January 1979, Robert Faurisson, a French professor of literature at the University of Lyon, published two letters in &quot;Le Monde&quot; claiming that the gas chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist.

As a result of a TV interview, he was found guilty of defamation and incitement to racial hatred and given a suspended 3-month prison term, and a 21,000-franc (€3,200) fine. In addition he was ordered to pay for the reproduction of the judgement in national newspapers and television. This latter requirement was dropped after he appealed.

==Petition signed by Chomsky==
In the fall of 1979, American scholar Noam Chomsky contributed his name to a petition—signed by roughly 600 people, many disgraced academics, including Holocaust deniers Serge Thion, Arthur Butz, John Tuson Bennett and Mark Weber—concerning the affair:

Dr. Robert Faurisson has served as a respected professor of twentieth-century French literature and document criticism for over four years at the University of Lyon-2 in France. Since 1974 he has been conducting extensive historical research into the &quot;Holocaust&quot; question.
Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to a vicious campaign of harassment, intimidation, slander and physical violence in a crude attempt to silence him. Fearful officials have even tried to stop him from further research by denying him access to public libraries and archives.

We strongly protest these efforts to deprive Professor Faurisson of his freedom of speech and expression, and we condemn the shameful campaign to silence him.
We strongly support Professor Faurisson&#x27;s just right of academic freedom and we demand that university and government officials do everything possible to ensure his safety and the free exercise of his legal rights.

A number of French intellectuals criticized Chomsky&#x27;s signing of the petition, describing the extent of Faurisson&#x27;s Holocaust denial and his ties to neo-Nazi groups. In particular, Pierre Vidal-Naquet criticized the wording of the petition as &quot;scandalous&quot;, saying that it implied Faurisson was a serious researcher and not a forger:
What is scandalous about the petition is that it never raises the question of whether what Faurisson is saying is true or false, that it even presents his conclusions or &quot;findings&quot; as the result of a historical investigation, one, that is, in quest of the truth. To be sure, it may be argued that every man has a right to lies and falsehood, and that individual freedom entails that right, which is accorded, in the French liberal tradition, to the accused for his defence. But the right that the forger demands should not be conceded to him in the name of truth.

Vidal-Naquet said that Faurisson was not barred from access to public libraries or archives, and the only archive to ban him was the private Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine (Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation) in Paris. Vidal-Naquet believed that decision was entirely consistent with its declared mission, &quot;the fact that the staff of the Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, challenged in its fundamental activity, that of the memory of the crime, should --after years of forbearance-- refuse to serve Faurisson seems perfectly normal to me&quot;.

==Preface to &quot;Mémoire en défense&quot;==
Chomsky subsequently wrote an essay entitled &quot;Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression&quot;, in which he attacked his critics for failing to respect the principle of freedom of speech. Chomsky wrote:
Let me add a final remark about Faurisson&#x27;s alleged &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;. Note first that even if Faurisson were to be a rabid anti-Semite and fanatic pro-Nazi -- such charges have been presented to me in private correspondence that it would be improper to cite in detail here -- this would have no bearing whatsoever on the legitimacy of the defense of his civil rights. On the contrary, it would make it all the more imperative to defend them since, once again, it has been a truism for years, indeed centuries, that it is precisely in the case of horrendous ideas that the right of free expression must be most vigorously defended; it is easy enough to defend free expression for those who require no such defense. Putting this central issue aside, is it true that Faurisson is an anti-Semite or a neo-Nazi? As noted earlier, I do not know his work very well. But from what I have read -- largely as a result of the nature of the attacks on him -- I find no evidence to support either conclusion. Nor do I find credible evidence in the material that I have read concerning him, either in the public record or in private correspondence. As far as I can determine, he is a relatively apolitical liberal of some sort.

Chomsky granted permission for the essay to be used for any purpose. Serge Thion and Pierre Guillaume used it in 1980 as a preface when publishing a book by Faurisson, without Chomsky&#x27;s knowledge. Later Chomsky requested that the essay not be used in this manner, since he believed the French intellectual community was so incapable of understanding freedom of speech that it would only confuse them further, but his request came too late for the book to be changed. Chomsky subsequently said that asking for the preface to be removed is his one regret in the matter.

Chomsky&#x27;s essay sparked an even greater controversy. Critics such as Pierre Vidal-Naquet attacked him for defending Faurisson personally against charges of anti-Semitism and upholding his work as historical inquiry:
The simple truth, Noam Chomsky, is that you were unable to abide by the ethical maxim you had imposed. You had the right to say: my worst enemy has the right to be free, on condition that he not ask for my death or that of my brothers. You did not have the right to say: my worst enemy is a comrade, or a &quot;relatively apolitical sort of liberal&quot;. You did not have the right to take a falsifier of history and to recast him in the colors of truth.

Vidal-Naquet offered the following argument to substantiate his characterization of Faurisson as an anti-semite:
I shall simply say: Faurisson&#x27;s personal anti-Semitism, in fact, interests me rather little. It exists and I can testify to it, but it is nothing compared with the anti-Semitism of his texts. Is it anti-Semitic to write with consummate calm that in requiring Jews to wear the yellow star starting at the age of six &quot;Hitler was perhaps less concerned with the Jewish question than with ensuring the safety of German soldiers&quot;? Certainly not, within Faurisson&#x27;s logic, since in the final analysis there is no practical anti-Semitism possible. But within Chomsky&#x27;s logic? Is the invention of an imaginary declaration of war against Hitler, in the name of the international Jewish community, by an imaginary president of the World Jewish Congress, a case of anti-Semitism or of deliberate falsification?

John Goldsmith writes that &quot;Unsympathetic critics used it as an opportunity to brand Chomsky with anti-Semitic labels, but even critics potentially sympathetic to Chomsky&#x27;s political views felt his remarks showed lack of judgment.&quot;

Other critics held that Faurisson&#x27;s statements were the archetype of anti-Semitism, and that the logical conclusion of Chomsky&#x27;s statement would be that Nazism was not anti-Semitic. The main argument for this is that Holocaust deniers are not interested in truth, but &quot;motivated by racism, extremism, and virulent anti-Semitism&quot;.

==Chomsky&#x27;s response==

Responding to a request for comment, Chomsky doubled down, arguing that Faurisson&#x27;s right to express and publish his opinions on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints. The affair generated controversy among scholars both in France and the United States.

In a response to a letter circa 1989–1991, Chomsky said:
A professor of French literature was suspended from teaching on grounds that he could not be protected from violence, after privately printing pamphlets questioning the existence of gas chambers. He was then brought to trial for &quot;falsification of History&quot;, and later condemned for this crime, the first time that a modern Western state openly affirmed the Stalinist-Nazi doctrine that the state will determine historical truth and punish deviation from it. Later he was beaten practically to death by Jewish terrorists. As of now, the European and other intellectuals have not expressed any opposition to these scandals; rather, they have sought to disguise their profound commitment to Stalinist-Nazi doctrine by following the same models, trying to divert attention with a flood of outrageous lies.

In &quot;His Right to Say It&quot;, published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Chomsky stressed the conceptual distinction between &quot;endorsing&quot; someone&#x27;s view and &quot;defending&quot; his right to say it:
Vidal-Naquet misunderstood a sentence in the petition that ran, &quot;Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to...&quot; The term &quot;findings&quot; is quite neutral. One can say, without contradiction: &quot;He made his findings public and they were judged worthless, irrelevant, falsified...&quot; The petition implied nothing about quality of Faurisson&#x27;s work, which was irrelevant to the issues raised. [...]

I made it explicit that I would not discuss Faurisson&#x27;s work, having only limited familiarity with it (and, frankly, little interest in it). Rather, I restricted myself to the civil-liberties issues and the implications of the fact that it was even necessary to recall Voltaire&#x27;s famous words in a letter to M. le Riche: &quot;I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.&quot; [...] Many writers find it scandalous that I should support the right of free expression for Faurisson without carefully analyzing his work, a strange doctrine which, if adopted, would effectively block defense of civil rights for unpopular views. [...]
It seems to me something of a scandal that it is even necessary to debate these issues two centuries after Voltaire defended the right of free expression for views he detested. It is a poor service to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust to adopt a central doctrine of their murderers.Chomsky&#x27;s defense was attacked in turn. Critics said that his defense went beyond free speech arguments, and that it included a defense of Faurisson&#x27;s &quot;work&quot;.

==Chomsky&#x27;s biographers on the Faurisson affair==

Chomsky&#x27;s biographers have expressed a range of views on the Faurisson affair. In &quot;Chomsky: Ideas and ideals&quot;, Neil Smith writes: &#x27;Chomsky should perhaps have foreseen the negative effect of his activity and refrained from writing the way he did. Perhaps, but on balance perhaps not. Even had he seen the furore which would erupt and the degree that would ensue, the moral doctrine of defending freedom of speech is probably higher.&#x27;

In &quot;Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent&quot;, Robert Barsky says &#x27;Chomsky&#x27;s tactics may not always be the most appropriate in light of the causes that he supports but the values transmitted by his work are, according to virtually any reasonable measure, consistent with those of the libertarians.&#x27; Barsky also points out that although the Faurisson affair &#x27;has had a harmful and lasting effect on Chomsky ... Chomsky has refused to back down on the issue, even refusing to admit a momentary lack of judgment.&#x27;

Two other biographers, Milan Rai and Chris Knight, both refer to the Faurisson affair in the context of Chomsky&#x27;s uncompromising support for academic freedom for everyone including &#x27;war criminals&#x27;. In &quot;Chomsky&#x27;s Politics&quot;, Milan Rai quotes Chomsky saying that he even &#x27;supported the rights of American war criminals not only to speak and teach but also to conduct their research, on grounds of academic freedom, at a time when their work was being used to murder and destroy.&#x27;

In &quot;Decoding Chomsky&quot;, Chris Knight refers to Chomsky&#x27;s 1969 threat to &#x27;protest publicly&#x27; if fellow Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) academic Walt Whitman Rostow was denied a position at the university. Chomsky certainly considered Rostow, a prime architect of the Vietnam War, as a &#x27;war criminal&#x27; but insisted that MIT must stick to its principles of academic freedom - principles expressed when MIT&#x27;s President Howard Wesley Johnson stated that the university should be a &#x27;refuge from the censor, where any individual can pursue truth as he sees it, without any interference.&#x27; Johnson&#x27;s motivation for talking about academic freedom at this time of anti-war student unrest was largely to prevent any interference with MIT&#x27;s various military-funded research laboratories. But, Knight claims, Chomsky also believed he had to extend the principle of academic freedom to unusual lengths because any &#x27;less libertarian policy might have undermined his own conflicted position as an anti-war campaigner working in a laboratory funded by the US military.&#x27; Knight concludes that Chomsky&#x27;s subsequent position on Faurisson &#x27;did not imply any sympathy towards Holocaust denial. It was simply a logical extension of a principle common to all Western universities – one which his management at MIT felt obliged to uphold with special tenacity in view of what its own researchers were doing.&#x27;

Paul Berman, writing in &quot;Tablet&quot; in 2018, says that Chomsky&#x27;s biographers have largely accepted his claim that his defense of Faurisson was entirely on free speech grounds, and that Chomsky did not defend Faurisson&#x27;s actual positions or arguments. Berman, however, argues that Chomsky did in fact defend Faurisson substantively. Berman says that Chomsky adopted an &quot;oddly respectful tone toward Faurisson&quot; and that he &quot;left the clear implication that Faurisson is a scientific-minded researcher, with conclusions or findings that ought to be accorded the kind of respect that is accorded to any authentically scientific researcher.&quot;

<text>The Windy City ThunderBolts (colloquially known as the Bolts) are a professional baseball team based in Crestwood, Illinois. The ThunderBolts compete in the Frontier League (FL) as a member of the West Division in the Midwest Conference. The team plays its home games at Ozinga Field.

Founded in 1995, the team previously played at the Brennan Field from 1995 to 1997, and Howie Minas Field in 1998 in Midlothian, Illinois. The Bolts are one of the three Frontier League teams located in the Chicago metropolitan area, along with the Joliet Slammers and Schaumburg Boomers.

During their last season in Midlothian, the ThunderBolts won their first ever league championship and went on to sweep the Tennessee Tomahawks in the 1998 Heartland League Championship Series. The ThunderBolts are currently one of the oldest teams in the Frontier League, along with the Evansville Otters, Gateway Grizzlies and Washington Wild Things.

==History==
The franchise known as the Windy City ThunderBolts started as the Will County Claws in 1995 and played their home games at Lewis University&#x27;s Brennan Field in Romeoville. The Claws played in the struggling North Central League, which started in 1994 with six teams but fielded only four in 1995. The North Central League folded 18 games into its second season with the Claws finishing at 8–10. In 1996, the Will County Cheetahs joined the new four-team Heartland League. 

In winter 1997, the Cheetahs and the village of Crestwood, made a deal for Crestwood to build and own a new ballpark for the Cheetahs. Despite the high hopes for baseball in Crestwood for the 1998 season, it was quickly obvious that because of construction delays, the new park would not be ready. The Cheetahs needed a home field and with Romeoville not an option, neighboring Midlothian would be the solution to the Cheetahs&#x27; home field problem as they would play their 1998 season at tiny Howie Minas Field. In Midlothian, the Cheetahs would have one of their best seasons finishing in second place with a 37–29 record in the first half and earn a playoff spot for the first time in franchise history. In the Heartland League championship, the Cheetahs swept the heavily favored Tennessee Tomahawks 2 games to 0 to gain the franchise&#x27;s first title.

The Heartland League started the 1998 season with six teams and finished with only four teams. The Cheetahs, now known as the Cook County Cheetahs, won the last ever Heartland League championship as the league folded after three seasons.

In 1999, the Cheetahs joined the stable Frontier League and have been members since. The team changed their name to the Windy City ThunderBolts. An ownership change instigated the name change. The ThunderBolts mascot &quot;Boomer&quot; was born May 21, 2004. 

On August 26, 2007, the ThunderBolts won their first Central Division title. On September 17, 2007, they defeated the Washington Wild Things to win the Frontier League championship, three games to two. In 2008, they repeated a division title as the West Division champions and Frontier League champions, defeating the Kalamazoo Kings three games to none in the championship series. After heavy rains flooded Homer Stryker Field, the entire 2008 championship series was played at the Thunderbolts&#x27; Standard Bank Stadium. They thus became only the second Frontier League team to win back-to-back titles, joining the 2001–02 Richmond Roosters.

The ThunderBolts currently play at Ozinga Field (which was renamed from Standard Bank Stadium in 2018) which is located in Crestwood, Illinois. Ozinga Field is easily accessible from the south suburbs, located two blocks east of Cicero Avenue on the Midlothian Turnpike (1.5 miles south of I-294).

On April 23, 2019, assistant general manager Mike VerSchave was named general manager. Having served as assistant general manager since 2014, VerSchave replaced former general manager Mike Lucas.

The club celebrated its 20th anniversary on the weekend of June 1–2, 2019. The team wore Cheetahs uniforms as a part of the celebrations.

On October 27, 2023, Former White Sox Closer and 2005 World Series Champion, Bobby Jenks, was named Field Manager. Jenks enthusiastically stated, &quot;I believe I can do that and my track record has shown that I can do that&quot;.

==Players==

The San Diego Padres bought the rights to Cheetahs pitcher Chris Oxspring in 2000. He became the first player in franchise history to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in five games for the Padres in 2005.

In 2011, Dylan Axelrod became the first former ThunderBolt and second player in franchise history to play in MLB, having been called up by the Chicago White Sox.

On August 5, 2008, Isaac Hess threw the first no-hitter in ThunderBolts history. Tyson Corley threw the second on August 28, 2012.

Pitcher Andrew Werner became the third player in club history to make it to the majors when he started for the San Diego Padres in 2012.

Former major leaguer Josh Spence played with the ThunderBolts in 2014.

Tommy Nance played with Windy City in 2015. He later went on to be the fourth ThunderBolt alumnus to reach the Major Leagues when he debuted with the Chicago Cubs in 2021.

All 30 Major League Baseball teams have signed players out of the Frontier League. As of January 2023, the Cubs, Marlins, A&#x27;s, Twins, Rays, Pirates, Blue Jays, Rangers, Padres and White Sox currently have former ThunderBolts&#x27; players or coaches in their organizations. There are a total of 50 players who have reached the Major Leagues after playing in the Frontier League.

== Rivalries ==

=== Schaumburg Boomers ===
The rivalry between the Windy City ThunderBolts and the Schaumburg Boomers is mainly due to the 37-mile distance between the two home fields, the Ozinga Field and the Wintrust Field. Both teams meet frequently during the regular season, and have shared some hostility towards each other. In 2012, the Windy City ThunderBolts met the Schaumburg Boomers in a regular season game and upset the Boomers by a score of 4–2. During the game, Boomers player Chase Fontaine was hit by pitch by ThunderBolts player Dustin Williams. As a result, Fontaine had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery and had to have his jaw wired shut for five weeks. The incident marked the beginning of a rivalry often considered one of the most intense in Frontier League history by the press and fans.

In the following season, in the last regular season game between the ThunderBolts and the Boomers, a bench clearing brawl occurred after a Boomers player was mocking the ThunderBolts pitcher after a home run. The game ended with nine ejections for both teams. The Boomers ended up winning the game in the bottom of the 9th inning 6–5 with a walk-off single.

The rivalry between the ThunderBolts and the Boomers was at its peak from 2012 to 2019, when the Boomers won two consecutive championships in a row and when they were facing each other six to eight series per year. After 2019, the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down, as the Frontier League was expanded to 16 teams. The Boomers moved to the Midwest Conference in the 2021 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other four series a year.

<text>The Mid-Missouri Mavericks were a minor league baseball team which played in Columbia, Missouri, in the United States. The team was a member of the independent Frontier League, and had no association with a Major League Baseball team. From 2003 through 2005 the team played at Taylor Stadium, the home field of the baseball team of University of Missouri. The team suspended operations during the 2006 season in order to pursue financing and construction of a new stadium. The suspension of operations was subsequently extended through the 2007, 2008 and 2009 seasons after the bankruptcy of the principal owner, Bradley Wendt.

==History==
The Mid-Missouri franchise had a checkered history in the Frontier League. The team began in Newark, Ohio as the Newark Buffalos. The team was sold in 1996 and moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, becoming the Kalamazoo Kodiaks from 1996 to 1998, never reaching higher than last place in their division.

Before the 1999 season, the team moved again to London, Ontario and became the first Frontier League franchise located in Canada as the London Werewolves. They spent three seasons in Ontario (1999–2001), winning the Frontier League Championship in 1999, and making the playoffs in 2000. They played their home games at Labatt Memorial Park, believed to be the oldest operating baseball grounds in the world.

After a last place finish in 2001, the team moved again, this time to Canton, Ohio, as Canton Coyotes. The team played at Thurman Munson Stadium. They would spend just one season in Canton, finishing fourth in their division before moving to Columbia, Missouri, for the 2003 season. The team folded after the 2005 season.

<doc id="475734" wikidata="Q1240" url="?curid=475734" title="Antonio Segni">
<text>Antonio Segni (; 2 February 1891 – 1 December 1972) was an Italian politician and statesman who served as President of Italy from 1962 to 1964, and as Prime Minister of Italy from 1955 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1960.

A member of the Christian Democracy party, Segni held numerous prominent offices in Italy&#x27;s post-war period, serving as the country&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Defence, Agriculture, and Public Education. He was the first Sardinian to become head of state and government. He was also the second shortest-serving president in the history of the Republic and the first to resign from office, due to illness.

==Early life==
Segni was born in Sassari in 1891. His father, Celestino Segni, was a lawyer and professor at the University of Sassari, while his mother, Annetta Campus, was a housewife. He grew up in a well-off family, involved in Sardinian politics; his father served as municipal and provincial councilor for Sassari, as well as deputy mayor during the early 1910s. He began studying at the University of Sassari, where he would found a section of Azione Cattolica Italiana.

In 1913, Segni graduated with merit at the University of Sassari, with the thesis &quot;Il vadimonium&quot; on civil procedure in Roman law. He completed his studies in Rome with Giuseppe Chiovenda, of which he became the favorite student; in the law firm of the jurist, he met Piero Calamandrei, with whom he built a close friendship that would last a lifetime.

When the World War I broke out, Segni was enlisted as an artillery officer. Discharged, after some months, he continued his profession as lawyer, specializing in civil procedure. In 1920, he started his academic career as law professor at the University of Perugia. In 1921, he married Laura Carta Caprino (18 April 1896 – 21 July 1977) daughter of a rich landowner, with whom he had four children, including Mario, who would become a prominent politician during the early 1990s.

During these years, Segni started his involvement in politics. In 1919, he joined the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI), a Christian democratic party, led by Don Luigi Sturzo. In 1923, he was appointed in party&#x27;s national council. Segni ran in the 1924 Italian general election for Sardinia&#x27;s constituency but was not elected. He remained a member of the PPI until all political organizations were dissolved by Benito Mussolini two years later in 1926. For the next 17 years, Segni left political life, continuing to teach civil procedure and agrarian law at the universities of Pavia, Perugia, Cagliari, and Sassari, where he later served as rector from 1946 to 1951.

==Early political career==
In 1943, after the fall of Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime, Segni was one of the founders of Christian Democracy (DC), the heir of the PPI. On 12 December 1944, he was appointed Undersecretary to the Ministry of Agriculture in the second Bonomi government.

===Minister of Agriculture===

In the 1946 Italian general election, Segni was elected to the Constituent Assembly for the consistency of Cagliari–Sassari–Nuoro, receiving more than 40,000 votes. On 13 July 1946, he was appointed Minister of Agriculture in the second De Gasperi government. As minister, he primarily focused on the growth of agricultural production, functional to improving Italy&#x27;s conditions after the end of the war. Segni tried to reform agricultural contracts but was strongly opposed by conservatives and by many members of the DC. The failure of this legislative proposal accelerated the timing of the development of the land reform.

The land reform, approved by the Italian Parliament in October 1950, was financed in part by the funds of the Marshall Plan launched by the United States in 1947 and considered by some scholars as the most important reform of the entire post-war period. Segni&#x27;s reform proposed, through forced expropriation, the distribution of land to agricultural labourers, thus making them small entrepreneurs and no longer subject to the large landowner. If in some ways the reform had this beneficial result, for others it significantly reduced the size of farms, effectively removing any possibility of transforming them into advanced businesses. This negative element was mitigated and in some cases eliminated by forms of cooperatives.

Segni, who was a landowner, ordered the expropriation of most of his own estate in Sardinia. He became known as a &quot;white Bolshevik&quot; for his agrarian reforms. Modern historians assert that landowners were instead favoured by Segni, and his decrees allowed them to reclaim land that had been granted to the peasantry by the preceding administration.

===Minister of Public Education===
In July 1951, after a cabinet reshuffle, Segni left his office as Minister of Agriculture and was appointed the Italian Minister of Public Education in De Gasperi&#x27;s seventh government, succeeding Guido Gonella.

As minister, Segni was particularly involved in the fight against illiteracy, in the improvement of teaching activities, and in the construction of new schools around the country; however, he did not continue the important reforms started by his predecessor. He tried to implement the reform step by step but encountered strong resistance, even in the ministries that were supposed to finance these measures. Segni proposed to replace the high school exam with an admission test to university, but this was rejected. His reforms, which also received various appreciations from the opposition parties due to his secular idea of school that was very different from that of Gonella, were not ambitious as the ones of his predecessor.
The 1953 Italian general election was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a majority bonus system of two-thirds of seats in the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies for the coalition that would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was strongly opposed by both the opposition parties and DC&#x27;s smaller coalition partners that had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the &quot;scam law&quot; by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide victory of the DC.

The campaign of the opposition to the electoral law achieved its goal, as the government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses. In July 1953, Segni was ousted from office in the newly formed government of Alcide De Gasperi. Frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition, and De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Italian Parliament on 2 August. On 17 August, Italian president Luigi Einaudi appointed Pella as new prime minister, who selected Segni as his Minister of Public Education. Pella remained in power only for five months. In the successive governments of Amintore Fanfani and Mario Scelba, Segni was not appointed in any office.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
In the 1955 Italian presidential election held on 28–29 April of that year, Giovanni Gronchi was elected the new president of the Republic. After the election, a political crisis between prime minister Scelba and DC&#x27;s leader Fanfani broke out. In July 1955, Scelba resigned from the office, and Segni received the task of forming a new cabinet. He started consultations with parties to explore the possibilities of forming a new coalition government, obtaining the approval of DC, Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) and Italian Liberal Party (PLI), and the external support from the Italian Republican Party (PRI). On 6 July, Segni sworn in as the new prime minister. On 18 July, the government&#x27;s program was approved by the Chamber of Deputies with 293 votes in favour and 265 against. On 22 July, the Senate of the Republic approved the confidence vote with 121 votes in favour and 100 against.

===First government===

Segni&#x27;s first government is widely considered among the most important cabinets in the history of the Republic. During his premiership, in 1955, Italy became a member of the United Nations (UN) in 1955. In March 1957, Segni signed the Treaty of Rome, which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), between Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The Treaty of Rome still remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day European Union (EU).

Segni had always been a strong supporter of European integration; according to him, in a world governed by great powers, European unity was the only possible way to influence the world. He also strengthened relations with West Germany, becoming a close friend of Konrad Adenauer. As premier, he also had to face the complicated Suez crisis of 1956, in which he staunchly defended Italy&#x27;s economic interests in the area, always bearing in mind the need to safeguard Atlantic and European solidarity.

During his premiership, Segni often had conflict with Fanfani, who believed that the government should have a more critical attitude towards the Anglo-French choices. Moreover, the brutal Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 further divided Segni and Fanfani. Segni opposed an anti-communist legislative intervention, as Fanfani asked. The clash between the two leaders was so bitter that Segni threatened to resign. In his diary, Segni wrote: &quot;The events of Hungary are unfortunately subjected to repressive political speculation. I refuse to speculate on them.&quot;

In domestic policy, Segni&#x27;s government was particularly active in judiciary policies. A law established the National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL), as well as the Superior Council of the Judiciary. The most important event of all was the official opening of the Constitutional Court of Italy. In 1957, political tensions arose between the Italian president Gronchi and foreign affairs minister Gaetano Martino, regarding government&#x27;s foreign policy. In May 1957, the PSDI withdrew its support for the government, and Segni resigned on 6 May. On 20 May, Adone Zoli sworn in as new head of government.

===After the premiership===

In July 1958, Zoli resigned, after having lost his majority in the Italian Parliament, and Fanfani became the prime minister again. Segni was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Italy and the country&#x27;s Minister of Defence.

As minister, Segni worked to represent the interests of the Italian Armed Forces, increasing wages and social securities for retired veterans, as well as strengthening military equipment and weapons. He also accepted NATO missile bases for atomic weapons, convinced that they were a necessary tool to ensure the defence of Italy more than a danger that exposed the country to possible reprisals.

In January 1959, a conspicuous group of Christian Democrats started voting against their own government, forcing Fanfani to resign on 26 January 1959 after six months in power.

===Second government===
In February 1959, Gronchi gave Segni the task of forming a new cabinet, and he officially sworn in as the new prime minister on 16 February. Segni formed a one-party government, which was composed only by DC members, and was externally supported by minor centre-right and right-wing parties, as well as the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).

Segni attempted to strengthen Atlantic solidarity and to present Italy as Europe&#x27;s most reliable ally of the United States. He also tried to represent the reassuring alternative to Fanfani&#x27;s resourcefulness, advocating for Atlanticism in a season characterized by openings to the left, which was supported by Fanfani. The most comforting signals came from the economy, as industry and commerce expanded, unemployment declined, and Italy&#x27;s GDP grew by over 6%, a rhythm that placed it among the most dynamic countries in the world.

In social policy, various reforms in social welfare were carried out. A law of 21 March 1959 extended insurance against occupational diseases to agricultural workers, while a law approved on 17 May 1959 introduced a special additional indemnity for retired civil servants. Another important law, dated 4 July 1959, extended pension insurance to all artisans.

In March 1960, the PLI withdrew its support to his government and Segni was forced to resign. After few months of Fernando Tambroni&#x27;s government, Fanfani returned to the premiership on 26 July, this time with an openly centre-left program supported by the PSI abstention, and Segni was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. In August 1961, Segni and Fanfani made an historic trip to Moscow to meet the Soviet leaders.

==President of Italy==

In May 1962, when Gronchi&#x27;s term as president of Italy expired, Segni was proposed as the DC&#x27;s candidate by new party&#x27;s leader Aldo Moro for the 1962 presidential election held on 2–6 May. With Segni&#x27;s choice, Moro wanted to reassure the conservative representatives of his own party, worried about a possible extreme shift on leftist stances, after the beginning of the organic centre-left period in February 1962. On the first two rounds, the Italian Communist Party (PCI) decided to vote for Umberto Terracini, while the PSI supported Sandro Pertini. After the third round, the PCI and PSI decided to converge on the candidacy of the PSDI, Giuseppe Saragat, who gained also the favor of some DC representatives.

After several ballots, Segni was finally elected president on 6 May 1962 with 51% of the votes, 443 votes on a total 854 electors. His election was allowed thanks to the votes of monarchist and neo-fascist representatives. It was the first time that DC&#x27;s official candidate succeeded in being elected president of the Republic.

Many influent entities, notably including the Bank of Italy, the Armed Forces, Vatican hierarchies, as well as economic and financial world, were concerned about the entry of the PSI into the government, and considered Segni a reference of stability and their most prominent political landmark. His power grew further in the aftermath of the 1963 Italian general election, which was characterized by a loss for the DC due to its new leftist policies. Despite Segni&#x27;s opposition, at the end of the year, Moro and the PSI secretary Pietro Nenni launched their first centre-left government, ruling the country for more than four years.

===Vajont Dam disaster===

As president, Segni had to face one of the most tragic events in Italian republican history, namely the Vajont Dam disaster. On 9 October 1963, a landslide occurred on Monte Toc, in the province of Pordenone. The landslide caused a megatsunami in the artificial lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths. In the previous months, the Adriatic Society of Electricity (SADE) and the Italian government, which both owned the dam, dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster.

On the following day, Segni visited the affected areas, promising justice for the victims. Immediately after the disaster, both the government and local authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. Despite these statements, numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded in the previous months and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it. The communist newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; was the first to denounce the actions of management and government. The DC accused the PCI of political profiteering from the tragedy and then-prime minister Giovanni Leone promised to bring justice to the people killed in the disaster. A few months after the end of his premiership, he became the head of SADE&#x27;s team of lawyers, who significantly reduced the amount of compensation for the survivors and ruled out payment for at least 600 victims.

===1964 coalition crisis===
On 25 June 1964, the government of Aldo Moro was beaten on the budget law for the Italian Ministry of Education concerning the financing of private education, and on the same day Moro resigned. During the presidential consultations for the formation of a new cabinet, Segni asked Nenni to exit from the government majority.

On 16 July, Segni sent the Carabinieri General Giovanni De Lorenzo to a meeting of representatives of the DC, to deliver a message in case the negotiations around the formation of a new centre-left government would fail. According to some historians, De Lorenzo reported that Segni was ready to give a subsequent mandate to Cesare Merzagora, the president of the Senate, asking him of forming a president&#x27;s government composed by all the conservative forces in the Italian Parliament. Ultimately, Moro managed to form another centre-left majority. During the negotiations, Nenni had accepted the downsizing of his reform programs. On 17 July, Moro went to the Quirinal Palace, with the acceptance of the assignment and the list of ministers of his second government.

===Illness and resignation===
On 7 August 1964, during a meeting at the Quirinal Palace with Moro and Saragat, Segni suffered a serious cerebral hemorrhage. At the time, he was 73 years old and the first prognosis was not positive. In the interim, Merzagora served as Acting President of the Republic. Segni only partially recovered and decided to retire from office on 6 December 1964. Immediately after his resignation, Segni was appointed senator for life &quot;ex officio&quot;. The 1964 Italian presidential election resulted in the election of Saragat on 29 December.

==Death and legacy==

On 1 December 1972, Segni died in Rome at the age of 81.

During all his political career, Segni acted as a moderate conservative, staunchly opposing the &quot;opening to the left&quot; proposed by Fanfani and Moro, but he also tried not to bring his own party too far to the right. He was the first Italian president to resign from office.

The frail, often ailing Segni, was affectionately called &quot;il malato di ferro&quot;, which literally means &quot;the iron invalid&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; once quoted a friend of his: &quot;He is like the Colosseum; he looks like a ruin but he&#x27;ll be around for a long time.&quot;

===Controversies===

During his presidency, Segni was particularly influenced by General Giovanni De Lorenzo, commander of the Carabinieri, a former partisan with monarchical ideals. On 25 March 1964, De Lorenzo met with Carabinieri&#x27;s commanders of the divisions of Milan, Rome, and Naples, proposing a response to a hypothetical national crisis, known as &quot;Piano Solo&quot;. The plan consisted of a set of measures to occupy certain institutions, such as Quirinal Palace in Rome, and essential media infrastructures, like television and radio, as well as the neutralisation of communist and socialist parties, with the deportation of hundreds of left-wing politicians to a secret military base in Sardinia. The list of people to be deported also included intellectuals, such as Pier Paolo Pasolini.
On 10 May, De Lorenzo presented his plan to Segni, who was particularly impressed by it. Journalists Giorgio Galli and Indro Montanelli believed that Segni did not really want to carry out a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but that he wanted to use the plan like a threat for political purposes. The coup plans were revealed in 1967, when the journalists Eugenio Scalfari and Lino Jannuzzi published the plan in the Italian news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot; in May 1967. The results of the official investigation remained classified until the early 1990s. It was released by premier Giulio Andreotti to the parliamentary investigation into Operation Gladio. &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot; mentioned that some 20,000 Carabinieri were supposed to be deployed around the country, with more than 5,000 agents in Rome. Segni was never investigated for this fact.

<text>The Hootenanny Singers are a popular folk group from Västervik, Sweden, founded in 1961. The group included Björn Ulvaeus, who later became a member of ABBA. Other band members were Johan Karlberg (b. Karl Johan Hilding Karlberg, 14 April 1943, Vimmerby, Sweden d. 16 August 1992, Västervik, Sweden), Tonny Rooth (b. Sven Villy Tonny Rooth, 30 November 1943, Västervik, Sweden) and Hansi Schwarz (b. Hans Carl Schwarz, 16 March 1942, Munich, Germany d. 10 January 2013, Lund, Sweden). The group was named &quot;The Northern Lights&quot; for a US-released LP in 1966.

==Early debut==
In 1964, they debuted on the Swedish TV programme &quot;Hylands Hörna&quot; with locally well-known Swedish poet Dan Andersson&#x27;s &quot;Jag väntar vid min mila&quot; (translated as &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting at the Charcoal Kiln&quot;).

The band had an early hit in the song &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, based on the Russian song &quot;May There Always Be Sunshine&quot; by Arkady Ostrovsky. Due to a lack of international copyright agreements, songs from the Soviet Union were then considered to be in the public domain. Stig Anderson and Bengt Bernhag, co-founders of the band&#x27;s production company Polar Music, claimed credits for the song&#x27;s arrangement and Swedish lyrics. Russian media sources would later describe this as plagiarism or theft. After reaching number five on the Swedish charts, the band translated and recorded versions of &quot;Gabrielle&quot; in German, Finnish, Italian, Dutch, and English.

==Later career and end of the group==
Their extensive touring of Swedish outdoor concert venues brought them fame and they had numerous hit singles on the Svensktoppen chart. Their biggest hit was &quot;Omkring tiggarn från Luossa&quot;, which broke the record by spending 52 weeks on Svensktoppen between 26 November 1972 and 18 November 1973. Johan Karlberg dropped out of the band in the late 1960s to take over his father&#x27;s business. Karlberg died in 1992. Hansi Schwarz was also the leader of the Västervik folk ballad festival for many years. Schwarz died in 2013. Tonny Rooth and Björn Ulvaeus are the two surviving members of the band&#x27;s original line-up. Some of the tracks on the 1969 album &quot;På tre man hand&quot; were released as solo singles by Björn Ulvaeus.

<text>The Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series(often referred to as the Ender&quot; saga and also the Enderverse) is a series of science fiction books written by American author Orson Scott Card. The series started with the novelette &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, which was later expanded into the novel of the same title. It currently consists of sixteen novels, thirteen short stories, 47 comic issues, an audioplay, and a film. The first two novels in the series, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, each won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards.

The series is set in a future where mankind is facing annihilation by an aggressive alien society, an insect-like race known formally as &quot;Formics&quot;, but more colloquially as &quot;Buggers&quot;. The series protagonist, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, is one of the child soldiers trained at Battle School (and eventually Command School) to be the future leaders for the protection of Earth.

==Enderverse==

===Ender series===
Starting with &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, five novels and one novella have been released that tell the story of Ender. The first four have been described (and released as a box set) as &quot;The Ender Quartet&quot; and, together with &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;, as &quot;The Ender Quintet&quot;. Card first wrote &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; as a novelette, but later expanded it into a novel.

While the first novel concerned itself with armies and space warfare, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, and &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; are more philosophical in nature, dealing with the difficult relationship between the humans and the &quot;Piggies&quot; (or &quot;Pequeninos&quot;), and Andrew&#x27;s (Ender&#x27;s) attempts to stop another xenocide from happening.

&quot;A War of Gifts: An Ender Story&quot;, a novella, was released in October 2007. It is a parallel story set during Ender&#x27;s first year in Battle School.

&quot;Ender in Exile,&quot; which is both a sequel to Ender&#x27;s Game and a prequel to &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, was released in November 2008. It involves Ender&#x27;s journey to the first human colony on a former Formic world. Because of changes Card made to a few details of the story of that first colony ship and Ender&#x27;s role as governor, it serves as a replacement for the last chapter of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. It also deals with his meeting a character from the parallel Shadow saga (effectively wrapping up a remaining plotline in the parallel series).

===Shadow saga ===
Starting with &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, five novels and one novella have been released that tell the story of the people Ender left behind – this has been dubbed the &quot;Shadow saga&quot; (also known as the &quot;Shadow Quintet&quot;).

&quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; is a parallel novel to &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, telling many of the same events from the perspective of Bean, Ender&#x27;s second-in-command and a mostly peripheral character in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, while the first three sequels, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot; tell the story of the struggle for world dominance after the Bugger War. This involves the Battle School children, as well as Ender&#x27;s brother, Peter Wiggin, and Petra Arkanian going up against Achilles de Flandres (from Poke&#x27;s crew).

A sequel novella to &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot; named &quot;Shadows in Flight&quot; further introduces three of Bean&#x27;s children who also have Anton&#x27;s key turned.

&quot;The Last Shadow&quot; (previously called &quot;Shadows Alive&quot;), released in November 2021, takes place after both &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; and &quot;Shadows in Flight&quot;, tying up the two series, and explaining some unanswered questions.

===Formic Wars===

====The First Formic War====
Card and Aaron Johnston wrote a trilogy to cover the events of the First Formic War. Chronologically, this series comes before all other books in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series. &quot;Earth Unaware&quot; was released on July 17, 2012. &quot;Earth Afire&quot;, was released on June 4, 2013, and &quot;Earth Awakens&quot; on June 10, 2014.

====The Second Formic War====
On November 4, 2013, Johnston confirmed work on a second trilogy of novels covering the Second Formic War, with the manuscript for the first book due in 2014. The planned titles of the novels are (in order) &quot;The Swarm&quot;, &quot;The Hive&quot;, and &quot;The Queens.&quot; &quot;The Swarm&quot;, continuing the stories of Victor Delgado, Mazer Rackham, and Bingwen, was released on August 2, 2016. &quot;The Hive&quot; was released on June 11, 2019.

===Fleet School===
According to an interview with Orson Scott Card at Southern Virginia University, Fleet School is &quot;a new set of sequels to Ender&#x27;s Game. It&#x27;s for a young adult audience. It&#x27;s what happens to Battle School after the International Fleet loses its purpose of war. It becomes what is called Fleet School, and it prepares kids to become commanders / explorers in the colonies that are going to be forming. We get to see that as the school administrators repurpose the school, the Battle Room is still there, but it&#x27;s a whole different kind of education.&quot; On November 12, 2015, Orson Scott Card announced the title of the series and its first novel, &quot;Children of the Fleet&quot; was released on October 10, 2017.

==Publications==

=== Novels in the series ===
There are 19 publications in the Ender&#x27;s Game series: five novels and one novella in the Ender series, five novels and one novella in the Shadow Saga, five novels in the Formic Wars series, one novel in the Fleet School series, and one collection of short stories. According to Card, there is no strictly preferred order of reading them, except that &quot;Xenocide&quot; should be read right before &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;.
The books can be read in the order in which they were originally written or in chronological order.

===Game===
In 2008 it was announced an Ender&#x27;s Game video game was in the works. It was to be known as &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game: Battle Room&quot; and was a planned digitally distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Shadow Complex&quot;. Chair had sold the licensing of &quot;Empire&quot; to Card, which became a best-selling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe and that it would have focused on the Battle Room.

In December, 2010, it was announced that the video game development had stopped and the project put on indefinite hold.

Orson Scott Card and Amaze Entertainment also came to an agreement about a game adaption of the Ender&#x27;s Game novel but the plans never became a reality.

The film &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; was released in the UK on October 25, 2013, and in the USA on November 1, 2013. The first script was based on two installments of the &quot;Ender&quot; series, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, when optioned by Warner Brothers, but was adapted to focus exclusively on &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; when purchased by Lionsgate. The cast includes Harrison Ford, Abigail Breslin, Ben Kingsley, Hailee Steinfeld, and Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin. The film was directed by Gavin Hood.

==Formics==
The Formics, also known as Buggers, are a fictional ant-like alien species from the Ender&#x27;s Game series of science fiction novels by Orson Scott Card.

According to the novel canon, the Formics attacked Earth 50 years before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as Mazer Rackham. The first book in the series, Ender&#x27;s Game, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.

The term &quot;Formic&quot; is derived from &quot;formica&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;ant&quot;; whereas &quot;bugger&quot; is a pejorative used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; that the term &#x27;Formic&#x27; was first used, interchangeably with &#x27;Bugger&#x27;. Later books used &#x27;Formic&#x27; almost exclusively, as the more &#x27;scientific&#x27; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &quot;Buggers&quot; in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, chronologically next as &quot;Formics&quot; in &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;, and again as &quot;Buggers&quot; in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; and &quot;Xenocide&quot;. The feature film adaptation of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; uses &quot;Formics&quot; exclusively.

The Formic species consists of hive-minded colonies directed by queens. In Ender&#x27;s Game, Graff described them as being an insect that &quot;could have evolved on earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago,&quot; and that their evolutionary ancestors could have looked similar to Earth&#x27;s ants. While often described as &quot;insectoid&quot;, the Formics are warm-blooded, developed an internal skeleton and shed most of their exoskeleton, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they respire and perspire. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in &quot;Xenocide&quot;, implications exist that &#x27;workers&#x27; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be trimorphic in &quot;Shadows in Flight&quot;. Drones are much smaller and depend on a Hive Queen for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in &quot;Xenocide&quot;, Ender claims they rely on heat signature.

<doc id="475752" wikidata="Q503867" url="?curid=475752" title="HMS Griffin (H31)">
<text>HMS &quot;Griffin&quot; (H31) was a G-class destroyer, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. In World War II she took part in the Norwegian Campaign of April–May 1940 and the Battle of Dakar in September before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November. She generally escorted larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks from the Italian Fleet. &quot;Griffin&quot; took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941. In June she took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942.

&quot;Griffin&quot; saw no action in the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but was escorting convoys for most of her time in the Indian Ocean. In June she returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta in Operation Vigorous. Beginning in November 1942, she was converted to an escort destroyer in the United Kingdom and was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 March 1943. The ship, now renamed HMCS &quot;Ottawa&quot;, was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic until she was transferred in May 1944 to protect the forces involved with the Normandy Landings. Working with other destroyers, &quot;Ottawa&quot; sank three German submarines off the French coast before she returned to Canada for a lengthy refit. After the end of the European war in May 1945 she was used to bring Canadian troops until she was paid off in October 1945. &quot;Ottawa&quot; was sold for scrap in August 1946.

==Description==
&quot;Griffin&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Griffin&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . Her complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but in increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Griffin&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

Beginning in mid-1940, her anti-aircraft armament was increased although when exactly the modifications were made is not known. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a (12-pounder) AA gun and the quadruple .50-calibre Vickers mounts were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon. Two more Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure.

&quot;Griffin&quot; was laid down by Vickers-Armstrongs Naval Construction Works at Barrow-in-Furness on 20 September 1934, launched on 15 August 1935, and completed on 6 March 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment such as armament, she cost £248,518. &quot;Griffin&quot; joined her sisters and was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. She escorted the ocean liner SS &quot;Strathnaver&quot; between Malta and Alexandria in the Munich Crisis in September 1938. She then escorted the light cruiser on her voyage to Aden. She collided with the target destroyer on 2 February 1939 and her repairs were completed five days later.

===With the Royal Navy, 1939–1942===
On 3 September 1939 &quot;Griffin&quot; was in Alexandria and still assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. In October she was transferred to home waters. On 7 October she was escorting the troop ship from Avonmouth bound for Gibraltar when the German submarine torpedoed the troop ship in the Western Approaches about west of Bloody Foreland in Ireland. 96 people were killed but &quot;Griffin&quot; attacked and chased away the submarine with depth charges and then rescued 766 survivors, whom she landed at Greenock on the Firth of Clyde on 9 October.

She rejoined her flotilla at Harwich in November, where they patrolled the North Sea and escorted local convoys. She rescued survivors from her sister after that ship struck a mine off Harwich on 21 November. She was damaged the same month and was under repair until 6 December. In preparation for the Norwegian Campaign, &quot;Griffin&quot; was transferred to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in April 1940.&quot;Griffin&quot; escorted the capital ships of the Home Fleet as they sortied into the North Sea on 7 April and continued that duty for the next several weeks.

On 26 April, &quot;Griffin&quot; and the destroyer captured the German trawler &quot;Schiff 26&quot;, bound for Narvik with a cargo that included guns, mines and ammunition. She was disguised as the Dutch &quot;Polares&quot; and armed with one gun and two torpedo tubes. Crewmen aboard the trawler failed to properly dispose of some of her code documents when she was boarded from &quot;Griffin&quot;. The recovered material allowed Bletchley Park to retrospectively break 6 days of naval Enigma codes. Whilst not operationally useful, this was the first break of the code and gave Alan Turing essential information on how Enigma was used, so allowing methods to be developed for future breaks. This was the first of several similar captures that were essential for the continued Allied breaking of the naval Enigma codes.

&quot;Griffin&quot; evacuated British and French troops from Namsos, and rescued survivors from the destroyer after she was sunk by Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers on 3 May. The &quot;Stuka&quot;s also attacked &quot;Griffin&quot;, without success. &quot;Griffin&quot; was then transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the North Atlantic Command at Gibraltar. She escorted the capital ships of Force H in the Battle of Dakar on 23 September, but was not engaged. On 20 October, with her sisters and , she sank the off Melilla. &quot;Griffin&quot; escorted the battleship and the cruisers and in Operation Coat in early November as they joined the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Griffin&quot; herself was transferred to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in Alexandria and took part in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November in Operation Collar.

In Operation Excess, &quot;Gallant&quot; struck a mine off Pantellaria on 10 January 1941 and &quot;Griffin&quot; rescued most of the survivors. In February 1941 she was transferred to the Red Sea where she escorted the aircraft carrier in the latter&#x27;s operations in support of the military offensive in Italian Somaliland (&quot;Operation Canvas&quot;). &quot;Griffin&quot; escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28–29 March. With her sister , she attacked some of the Italian destroyers, but lost them when they passed through their own smokescreen. &quot;Griffin&quot;, the Australian destroyer , and the gunboat bombarded Axis positions near Sollum in northwestern Egypt on 15 April.

She took part in the evacuation of British, Australian and New Zealand troops from Greece at the end of April. On 25 April a German air attack crippled the Dutch troop ship , which &quot;Griffin&quot; had been escorting to Megara to evacuate Allied troops. &quot;Griffin&quot; rescued about 300 survivors, sank &quot;Pennland&quot; by gunfire, and took the survivors to Crete. On 27 April &quot;Griffin&quot; rescued 50 survivors from the destroyers and , which had been sunk by German aircraft in the Sea of Crete.

&quot;Griffin&quot; again escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they covered a convoy from Alexandria to Malta on 8 May. In the evacuation of Crete at the end of May, &quot;Griffin&quot; evacuated 720 men from Souda Bay.

During Operation Exporter, the ship escorted the Australian light cruiser as she bombarded Vichy French positions in Lebanon on 2 July. &quot;Griffin&quot; escorted convoys to and from Tobruk from July to November. On 25 November she was escorting the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet when &quot;Barham&quot; was torpedoed by . She escorted the light cruiser when that ship bombarded Derna in early December and was transferred to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla later that month. &quot;Griffin&quot; escorted convoys to Malta in January and February 1942. until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in late February. &quot;Griffin&quot; was assigned to Force A of the fleet in the Indian Ocean raid by the Japanese in early April 1942. She returned to the Mediterranean to take part in Operation Vigorous, another convoy from Alexandria to Malta, in June. She rejoined the Eastern Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there until ordered home to begin conversion to an escort destroyer in September.

===Refit and transfer to Canada, 1942–1946===
Work on the conversion began on 2 November in Southampton and included the removal of two 4.7-inch guns and the 12-pounder AA gun, and their replacement with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar forward and additional depth charges aft. Type 286 and 271 radar sets were fitted, as well as additional 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns. While still refitting, on 1 March 1943, &quot;Griffin&quot; was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, and commissioned on 20 March, four days before her conversion was finished. The ship was renamed &quot;Ottawa&quot; on 10 April to commemorate an earlier which had been sunk. After working up at Tobermory, she sailed for Canada, and was gifted to the Canadians on 15 June. &quot;Ottawa&quot; became the senior ship of Escort Group C5 which worked between St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, and Derry, Northern Ireland until May 1944 when she became the senior ship of the 11th Escort Group. The 11th consisted of the Canadian destroyers , , , and and were tasked to protect the invasion forces for D-Day. On 6 July 1944, &quot;Ottawa&quot;, &quot;Kootenay&quot;, and the British frigate sank off Beachy Head, Sussex. &quot;Ottawa&quot; and &quot;Chaudière&quot; sank on 16 August near La Rochelle and two days later they sank west of Brest.

&quot;Ottawa&quot; was refitted in St. John&#x27;s between 12 October 1944 and 26 February 1945. On 11 March she collided with the Canadian minesweeper off Halifax and was under repair until 30 April. After the end of the war in May she ferried Canadian troops back to Canada until she was paid off on 31 October. &quot;Ottawa&quot; was sold to the International Iron and Metal Company in August 1946 and subsequently broken up.

<doc id="475753" wikidata="Q3354836" url="?curid=475753" title="Assisted take-off">
<text>In aviation, assisted takeoff is any system for helping aircraft to get into the air (as opposed to strictly under its own power). The reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft&#x27;s weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight, insufficient power, insufficient available runway length, or a combination of all three factors. Assisted takeoff is also required for gliders, which do not have an engine and are unable to take off by themselves.

==Catapults (CATO)==
A well-known type of assisted takeoff is an aircraft catapult. In modern systems fitted on aircraft carriers, a piston, known as a &quot;shuttle&quot;, is propelled down a long cylinder under steam pressure. The aircraft is attached to the shuttle using a tow bar or launch bar mounted to the nose landing gear (an older system used a steel cable called a catapult bridle; the forward ramps on older carrier bows were used to catch these cables), and is flung off the deck at about 15 knots above minimum flying speed, achieved by the catapult in a four-second run.

The United States is replacing carrier steam catapults with linear induction motors. The system is called the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). An electromagnetic wave traveling through the motor propels the armature along its length, pulling the plane with it. This system allows more precise control over the launch power, causing less wear on the aircraft.

==JATO and RATO==
JATO stands for &#x27;Jet-assisted takeoff&#x27; (and the similar RATO for &#x27;Rocket-assisted takeoff&#x27;). In the JATO and RATO systems, additional engines are mounted on the airframe which are used only during takeoff. After that the engines are usually jettisoned, or else they just add to the parasitic weight and drag of the aircraft. However, some aircraft such as the Avro Shackleton MR.3 Phase 2, had permanently attached JATO engines. The four J-47 turbojet engines on the B-36 were not considered JATO systems; they were an integral part of the aircraft&#x27;s propulsion, and were used during takeoff, climb, and cruise at altitude. The Hercules LC-130 can be equipped with a JATO rocket system to shorten takeoff as used in the LC-130 Skibird for polar missions.

During WW2 the German Arado Ar 234 and the Messerschmitt Me 323 &quot;Gigant&quot; used rocket units beneath the wings for assisted takeoff. Such systems were popular during the 1950s, when heavy bombers started to require two or more miles of runway to take off fully laden. This was exacerbated by the relatively low power available from jet engines at the time—for example the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress required eight turbojet engines to yield the required performance, and still needed RATO for very heavy payloads (a proposed update of the B-52 replaces these with half the number of much more powerful engines). In a Cold War context, RATO and JATO bottles were seen as a way for fighter aircraft to use the undamaged sections of runways of airfields which had been attacked.

==Gliders==

Glider aircraft which do not have an engine also require an assisted takeoff. Apart from self launching gliders, EASA recognizes four other launch methods: winch launches, aerotows, bungee launches and car tows.

==Gravity assistance==
Early pioneers in powered and unpowered flight used gravity to accelerate their aircraft to a speed which allowed its wings to generate enough lift to achieve independent flight. These included attempts to achieve flight from towers, city walls and cliffs. Generally more successful were attempts in which speed was built up by accelerating down hills and mountain slopes, sometimes on rails or ramps.

==Mother ship (carrier) aircraft==

Another form of gravity assistance is when an aircraft is released from a larger mother ship or mother craft. This may be because the daughter craft is incapable of taking off normally e.g. the atmospheric flight tests of the Space Shuttle.

Usually the rationale for such a system is to free the daughter craft from the need to climb to its release height under its own power. This allows the daughter craft to be designed with fewer weight and aerodynamic restrictions allowing for exotic configurations to be used or tested, for example the recent SpaceShipOne, and previously the Bell X-1 and other X-planes.

In the interwar years, in order to achieve long ranges with the technology of the time, trials were undertaken with floatplanes piggy-backed atop flying boats. With the floatplane carried part of the way to its destination and freed from having to use any of its own fuel in the initial climb, these combinations could deliver light but time-critical cargos faster and farther than a single individual aircraft (for example the Short Mayo Composite).

Hot air balloons have acted as &quot;motherships&quot; to hang gliders and para gliders in altitude and distance record attempts.

<text>HMS &quot;Grenville&quot; was the flotilla leader for the G-class destroyers, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. She spent most of the pre-war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II. In January 1940, &quot;Grenville&quot; struck a mine outside the Thames Estuary and sank with the loss of 77 of her crew.

==Description==
&quot;Grenville&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Yarrow side-fired, water-tube boilers. &quot;Grenville&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 175 officers and men.

The ship mounted five 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Grenville&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service history==
Ordered in 1934, the ship was laid down by the Yarrow Shipbuilding Company at Scotstoun in Glasgow on 29 September 1934, launched on 15 August 1935, and completed on 1 July 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £275,412. Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning, &quot;Grenville&quot; spent the prewar period as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. She spent ten months deployed off the Spanish coast in the Western Mediterranean during the Spanish Civil War before returning to Portsmouth for a brief overhaul between 24 May and 9 June 1937. The ship returned to the Mediterranean until she was given a more thorough refit in Portsmouth between 7 June and 25 July 1938.

On the outbreak of war in September 1939, &quot;Grenville&quot; was deployed in the Mediterranean. On 22 October, &quot;Grenville&quot; and her sisters , and were transferred to the Western Approaches Command and arrived at Plymouth on 2 November. &quot;Grenville&quot; and &quot;Grenade&quot; collided during the night of 7/8 November and &quot;Grenville&quot;″s No. 3 boiler room was flooded. She was under repair at HM Dockyard, Devonport until 1 December. While the ship was under repair, her flotilla had been transferred to the Nore Command at Harwich for local patrol and escort work. &quot;Grenville&quot; rejoined them the on 3 December and participated in several attempts to intercept enemy shipping traffic off the Dutch and German North Sea coasts. Whilst returning from one of these missions on 19 January &quot;Grenville&quot; struck a mine east of Kentish Knock Light Vessel. Seventy-seven of the ship&#x27;s company were killed as the ship sank.

<text>John Frank Stevens (April 25, 1853 – June 2, 1943) was an American civil engineer who built the Great Northern Railway in the United States and was chief engineer on the Panama Canal between 1905 and 1907. He also led the commission of American railway experts to Russia and was later President of the Interallied Technical Board.

== Biography ==
Stevens was born in rural Maine, near West Gardiner to John Stevens, a tanner and farmer, and Harriet Leslie French. He attended Maine State Normal School (now the University of Maine at Farmington) for two years. At the conclusion of his schooling in 1873, bleak economic conditions held little promise of a job, and he chose to go west. Entry into the field of civil engineering evolved from his experience in the Minneapolis city engineer&#x27;s office. For two years he carried out a variety of engineering tasks, including surveying and building railroads, and at the same time gained experience and an understanding of the subject. He became a practical engineer, self-taught and driven by a self-described &quot;bull-dog tenacity of purpose.&quot; In 1878 Stevens married Harriet T. O&#x27;Brien. They had five children, two of whom died in infancy.

By the age of 33, in 1886, Stevens was a principal assistant engineer for the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, and in charge of building the line from Duluth, Minnesota to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Although a large part of his work involved surveying, he assisted in all phases of railroading: reconnaissance, locating, organizing, and construction.

In 1889, Stevens was hired by James J. Hill as a locating engineer for the Great Northern Railway.

Stevens earned acclaim in 1889 when he explored Marias Pass, Montana, and determined its practicability for a railroad. He also discovered a pass through the Cascade Range, Stevens Pass, which bears his name. Stevens set railroad construction standards in the Mesabi Range of northern Minnesota, and supervised the construction of the Oregon Trunk Line. Hill promoted him to chief engineer in 1895, and later to general manager. He was an efficient administrator with remarkable technical skills and imagination. During his time at the Great Northern, Stevens built over a thousand miles of railroad, including the original Cascade Tunnel. (Most other Pacific Northwest landmarks with the word &quot;Stevens&quot; are named after Isaac Stevens, who is of no relation.)

== Panama Canal ==
Stevens left the Great Northern in 1903 for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, where he was promoted to vice-president. Then, in 1905, at Hill&#x27;s recommendation, he was hired by United States President Theodore Roosevelt as chief engineer of the Panama Canal.

Stevens&#x27; primary achievement in Panama was to build the infrastructure needed for the completion of the canal. &quot;The digging,&quot; he said, &quot;is the least thing of all.&quot; He proceeded immediately to build warehouses, machine shops, and piers. Communities for the personnel were planned and built to include housing, schools, hospitals, churches, and hotels. He authorized extensive sanitation and mosquito-control programs that eliminated yellow fever and other diseases from the Isthmus.

Reflecting his background, he saw the early stage of the canal project itself as primarily a problem in railroad engineering, which included rebuilding the Panama Railway and devising a rail-based system for disposing of the soil from the excavations. Stevens argued the case against a sea level canal of the kind that the French had tried to build. He convinced Theodore Roosevelt of the necessity of a high-level canal built with dams and locks.

== Resignation ==
Stevens, like his predecessor John Findley Wallace, resigned suddenly from the Canal project in 1907 to Roosevelt&#x27;s great annoyance, as the focus of the work turned to construction of the canal itself. Even though he had worked closely with the Panama Canal Commission chairman Theodore P. Shonts and was also able to directly approach the Roosevelt Administration with requests for the project, he only spent two years in Panama.

As a railroad engineer, Stevens had little expertise in building locks and dams, and may have realized he was no longer the best person for the remainder of the job. Stevens would also have been aware that the original Cascade Tunnel, for which he was responsible, had been built too close to the ruling grade (maximum gradient for a single locomotive) and was perhaps turning from a credit to a debit. The true reasons for his resignation have never been known.

== Russia (1917–1923) ==
Following the collapse of Imperial Russia in 1917, leaders of the provisional government appealed to President Wilson for help with their transportation systems and overall ability to stay in the war. Stevens was selected to chair a board of prominent U.S. railroad experts sent to Russia to rationalize and manage a system that was in disarray; among his work was updating the Trans-Siberian Railway. Their official mission was to &quot;aid in rehabilitation and conduct of its railways which had become demoralized and broken down and unable to function in any degree of efficiency&quot;. The board traveled across Russia on the Trans-Siberian railway and noticed significant amount of inefficency and made a comprehensive list of suggestions. Russian officials were initially reluctant to implement them, but with Premier Kerensky interventions in September, progress started to happen, but it ended abruptly with the overthrow of the provisional government in the October Revolution. Stevens was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the War Department for his service in Russia.

Stevens remained in Allied-occupied Manchuria and in 1919 headed the Inter-Allied Technical Board charged with the administration and operation of the Chinese Eastern and Siberian railways. His position on the board is also to avoid a Japanese takeover of the Chinese Eastern railway. He remained in an advisory capacity even after most occupying Allied troops were withdrawn. He finally left in 1923, after the Imperial Japanese Army left Siberia. 

== Subsequent career ==
After his return to the United States Stevens continued to work as a consulting engineer, ending his career in Baltimore in the early 1930s. He was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Franklin Medal in 1930.

He then retired to Southern Pines, North Carolina, where he died at the age of 90 in 1943. 

His papers are stored at Georgetown University&#x27;s Special Collections.

<text>HMS &quot;Grenade&quot; (H86) was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of World War II for service in home waters. The ship participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers sank &quot;Grenade&quot; as she evacuated Allied troops during Operation Dynamo on 29 May 1940.

==Description==
&quot;Grenade&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Grenade&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Grenade&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service==
&quot;Grenade&quot; was laid down by Alexander Stephen and Sons in Glasgow, Scotland on 3 October 1934, launched on 12 November 1935 and completed on 28 March 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £252,560. She was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Grenade&quot; was given a post-completion in Malta between 20 March and 24 April 1937. After returning home to give her crew leave and be refitted in Chatham Dockyard between 27 May and July 1938, the ship was then briefly transferred to the Red Sea in October 1938.

When World War II began in September 1939, &quot;Grenade&quot; was in Alexandria, but she, and her entire flotilla, was transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. On 7 November she collided with her flotilla leader, and her repairs were not completed until 9 December. During the next several months she was assigned to contraband control duties in the Downs. She, and her sister ship, , rescued 117 survivors from &quot;Grenville&quot; after the latter ship struck a mine on 19 January 1940. The ship was refitted in London between 27 January and 27 February, but was struck by the ocean liner on 27 February and was only temporarily repaired there. &quot;Grenade&quot; received permanent repairs in Harwich from 2 March to 3 April and was assigned to Home Fleet at Scapa Flow after their completion.

When Britain received word that the Germans were preparing to invade Norway on 7/8 April, &quot;Grenade&quot; was part of the escort of Convoy ON25 and was recalled, along with the rest of the escort, to join the Home Fleet. The ship, and the destroyer , escorted the oil tanker &quot;British Lady&quot; to Flakstadøya in the Lofoten Islands where a refuelling and repair base was being set up to support British naval operations in northern Norway. For the rest of the month &quot;Grenade&quot; escorted the battleship and the aircraft carrier in Norwegian waters. The ship provided cover during the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos in early May and tied up to the to rescue survivors after the latter&#x27;s forward magazine had been hit by a bomb from a Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber and exploded on 3 May. Four men on &quot;Grenade&quot; were wounded by splinters from near misses during this time and she rescued 36 sailors, but twenty of them died of their wounds before the ship reached Scapa Flow on 5 May.

&quot;Grenade&quot; was then transferred to the English Channel and collided with the anti-submarine trawler &quot;Clayton Wyke&quot; on 14 May in heavy fog. Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During the initial stages of the evacuation from Dunkirk the ship provided cover in the northern part of the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. &quot;Grenade&quot; was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler &quot;John Cattling&quot; towed &quot;Grenade&quot; over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.

<text>HMS &quot;Hunter&quot; was a H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed on both sides by Britain and France, until she struck a mine in May 1937. She was under repair for the next year and a half, after which she rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet. During the first few months of the Second World War, &quot;Hunter&quot; searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean until she was transferred back to Britain in February 1940. Returning to action in the Norwegian Campaign, she was sunk by German destroyers during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940.

==Description==
&quot;Hunter&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hunter&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but this was increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hunter&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Career==
Ordered on 13 December 1934, &quot;Hunter&quot; was laid down by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne, England, on 27 March 1935. She was launched on 25 February 1936 and completed on 30 September. Excluding government-furnished equipment such as armament, the ship cost £253,167. &quot;Hunter&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning.
The destroyer patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. &quot;Hunter&quot; struck a mine south of Almeria, Spain, on the afternoon of 13 May 1937. She suffered severe damage, with a heavy list, her radio wrecked and the bow flooded. Eight of her complement were killed and 24 wounded. The ship was towed clear of the minefield by the Spanish Republican destroyer . The mines had been laid by two ex-German Spanish Nationalist E-boats, the &quot;Requeté&quot; and the &quot;Falange&quot; on the night of 6 April. &quot;Hunter&quot; was towed to Almeria by , where she arrived in the early hours of 14 May. The light cruiser towed her to Gibraltar, where she was temporarily repaired from 15 May to 18 August. &quot;Hunter&quot; was towed to Malta for permanent repairs in August 1937, but they were not completed until 10 November 1938. The ship was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla once her repairs were finished and she was given a brief overhaul in Malta between 24 June and 4 July 1939. &quot;Hunter&quot; was sent to Plymouth for a more thorough refit in mid-August 1939 that lasted through 27 August.

===Second World War===

When the Second World War began on 3 September, &quot;Hunter&quot; was en route to Freetown, Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders, before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in late October. &quot;Hunter&quot; remained on that station until she was transferred to the British Isles in February 1940 and began a refit at Falmouth that lasted until 9 March. The ship rejoined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 17 March. On 6 April &quot;Hunter&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer minelayers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers joined the battlecruiser and her escorts.

During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April 1940, &quot;Hunter&quot; and four other H-class ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla attacked the German destroyers that had transported German troops to occupy Narvik in northern Norway the previous day. The flotilla leader led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. and were initially left at the entrance, but &quot;Hunter&quot; followed &quot;Hardy&quot; into the harbour and fired all eight of her torpedoes into the mass of shipping. One torpedo hit the in the forward engine room, followed by one of &quot;Hunter&quot;″s 4.7-inch shells. As the British ships were withdrawing, they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set &quot;Hardy&quot; on fire and forced her to run aground. &quot;Hunter&quot; eventually took the lead, but was severely damaged by the Germans, probably including one torpedo hit, and her speed dropped rapidly. &quot;Hotspur&quot;, immediately behind her, was temporarily out of control due to two hits, and rammed her from behind. When the ships managed to disengage, &quot;Hunter&quot; capsized. 107 men of the crew were killed and another five died of their wounds. The German destroyers rescued 46 men, who were released into Sweden on 13 April.

==Rediscovery==

The wreck was discovered on 5 March 2008 by the Royal Norwegian Navy mine control vessel , after being unknown for nearly 70 years, and will be marked as a war grave to commemorate the lost members of her crew. A series of coordinated memorial ceremonies were held on board British and Norwegian warships on Saturday 8 March 2008, honouring all those who died during the battles of Narvik. Over a thousand NATO personnel took part, including British and Norwegian sailors, Royal Marines and soldiers. Led by , the UK&#x27;s Fleet Amphibious Flagship, five warships steamed in line past the spot where the ship lies, marked for the occasion by &quot;Tyr&quot;. &quot;Hunter&quot;″s final resting place was marked with wreaths cast into the sea.

<doc id="475779" wikidata="Q28404" url="?curid=475779" title="Calliphoridae">
<text>The Calliphoridae (commonly known as blowflies, blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, or greenbottles) are a family of insects in the order Diptera, with almost 1,900 known species. The maggot larvae, often used as fishing bait, are known as gentles. The family is known to be polyphyletic, but much remains disputed regarding proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae and Helicoboscidae).

==Description==

=== Characteristics ===
Calliphoridae adults are commonly shiny with metallic colouring, often with blue, green, or black thoraces and abdomens. Antennae are three-segmented and aristate. The aristae are plumose their entire length, and the second antennal segment is distinctly grooved. Members of Calliphoridae have branched Rs 2 veins, frontal sutures are present, and calypters are well developed.
The characteristics and arrangements of hairlike bristles are used to differentiate among members of this family. All blowflies have bristles located on the meron. Having two notopleural bristles and a hindmost posthumeral bristle located lateral to presutural bristle are characteristics to look for when identifying this family.

The thorax has the continuous dorsal suture across the middle, along with well-defined posterior calli. The postscutellum is absent or weakly developed. The costa is unbroken and the subcosta is apparent on the insect.

===Development===
Most species of blowflies studied thus far are anautogenous; a female requires a substantial amount of protein to develop mature eggs within her ovaries (about 800 μg per pair of ovaries in &quot;Phormia regina&quot;). The current theory is that females visit carrion both for protein and egg laying, but this remains to be proven. Blowfly eggs, usually yellowish or white in color, are about 1.5 mm × 0.4 mm, and when laid, look like rice grains. While the female blowfly typically lays 150–200 eggs per batch, she is usually iteroparous, laying around 2,000 eggs during the course of her life. The sex ratio of blowfly eggs is usually 50:50, but one exception is females from two species of the genus &quot;Chrysomya&quot; (&quot;C. rufifacies&quot; and &quot;C. albiceps&quot;), which are either arrhenogenic (laying only male offspring) or thelygenic (laying only female offspring).

Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes about 8 hours to a day. Larvae have three stages of development (instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. The instars are separable by examining the posterior spiracles, or openings to the breathing system. The larvae use proteolytic enzymes in their excreta (as well as mechanical grinding by mouth hooks) to break down proteins on the livestock or corpse on which they are feeding. Blowflies are poikilothermic – the rate at which they grow and develop is highly dependent on temperature and species. Under room temperature (about 20 °C), the black blowfly &quot;Phormia regina&quot; can change from egg to pupa in 150–266 hours (six to 11 days). When the third larval stage is complete, it leaves the corpse and burrows into the ground to pupate, emerging as an adult 7–14 days later.

===Food sources===
Adult blowflies are occasional pollinators, being attracted to flowers with strong odors resembling rotting meat, such as the American pawpaw or dead horse arum. Little doubt remains that these flies use nectar as a source of carbohydrates to fuel flight, but just how and when this happens is unknown. One study showed the visual stimulus a blowfly receives from its compound eyes is responsible for causing its legs to extend from its flight position and allow it to land on any surface.

Larvae of most species are scavengers of carrion and dung, and most likely constitute the majority of the maggots found in such material, although they are not uncommonly found in close association with other dipterous larvae from the families Sarcophagidae and Muscidae, and many other acalyptrate muscoid flies.

===Predators===
Predators of blowflies include spiders, beetles, frogs, and birds, including chickens.

In the Chihuahuan desert of Mexico, a fungus, &quot;Furia vomitoriae&quot; (from the family of Entomophthoraceae) affects bluebottle flies. It forms masses of conidiophores erupting through the intersegmental areas (or clear bands) on the abdominal dorsum of the flies and eventually kills them.

==Diversity==
About 1,900 species of blowflies are known, with 120 species in the Neotropics, and a large number of species in Africa and Southern Europe.
Their typical habitats are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate.

==Economic importance==

===Myiasis===
Blowflies have caught the interest of researchers in a variety of fields, although the large body of literature on calliphorids has been concentrated on solving the problem of myiasis in livestock. The sheep blowfly &quot;Lucilia cuprina&quot; causes the Australian sheep industry an estimated AU$170 million a year in losses.

The most common causes of myiasis in humans and animals are the three dipteran families Oestridae, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae. Myiasis in humans is clinically categorized in six ways: dermal and subdermal, facial cavity, wound or trauma, gastrointestinal, vaginal, and generalized. If found in humans, the dipteran larvae are usually in their first instar. The only treatment necessary is just to remove the maggots, and the patient heals naturally. Whilst not strictly a myiasis species, the Congo floor maggot feeds on mammal blood, occasionally human.

===Screwworms===
The New World primary screwworm (&quot;Cochliomyia hominivorax&quot;), once a major pest in Southern United States, has been eradicated from the United States, Mexico, and Central America through an extensive release program by the USDA of sterilized males. The USDA maintains a sterile screwworm fly production plant and release program in the eastern half of the Republic of Panama to keep fertile screwworms from migrating north. Currently, this species is limited to lowland tropical countries in South America and some Caribbean islands.

The Old World primary screwworm (&quot;Chrysomya bezziana&quot;) is an obligate parasite of mammals. This fly is distributed throughout the Old World, including Southeast Asia, tropical and subtropical Africa, some countries in the Middle East, India, the Malay Peninsula, the Indonesian and Philippine Islands, and Papua New Guinea. 

The secondary screwworm (&quot;Cochliomyia macellaria&quot;) has become one of the principal species on which to base &quot;post mortem&quot; interval estimations because its succession and occurrence on decomposing remains has been well defined. The secondary screwworm is found throughout the United States and the American tropics, and in southern Canada during summers. This species is one of the most common species found on decomposing remains in the US South.

===Maggot therapy===
Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the medical use of selected, laboratory-raised fly larvae for cleaning nonhealing wounds. Medicinal maggots perform debridement by selectively eating only dead tissue. &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot; (&quot;Phaenicia sericata&quot;), or the common green bottlefly, is the preferred species used in maggot therapy. MDT can be used to treat pressure ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, venous stasis ulcers, and postsurgical wounds.

===Disease===
Adults may be vectors of pathogens of diseases such as dysentery. Flies, most commonly Calliphoridae, have frequently been associated with disease transmission in humans and animals, as well as myiasis. Studies and research have linked &quot;Calliphora&quot; and &quot;Lucilia&quot; to vectors of causal agents of bacterial infections. These larvae, commonly seen on decaying bodies, feed on carrion while the adults can be necrophagous or vegetative. During the process of decay, microorganisms (e.g. &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;) may be released through the body. Flies arrive at the scene and lay their eggs. The larvae begin eating and breaking down the corpse, simultaneously ingesting these organisms which is the first step of one transmission route.

The bacterium which causes paratuberculosis in cattle, pigs and birds (&quot;M. a. avium&quot;) has been isolated and recovered from these flies through several different experiments.

Other potential and threatening diseases include rabbit haemorrhagic disease in New Zealand and flystrike. Although strike is not limited to blow flies, these maggots are a major source of this skin invasion, causing lesions, which, if severe enough, may be lethal. Strike starts when blow flies lay eggs in a wound or fecal material present on the sheep. When the maggots hatch, they begin feeding on the sheep and thus irritating it. As soon as the first wave of maggots hatch, they attract more blow flies, causing the strike. Insecticides are available for blow fly prevention (typically containing cypermethrin), and precautionary measures may be taken, such as docking tails, shearing, and keeping the sheep healthy overall.

Salmonellosis has also been proven to be transmitted by the blow fly through saliva, feces and direct contact by the flies&#x27; tarsi. Adult flies may be able to spread pathogens via their sponging mouthparts, vomit, intestinal tract, sticky pads of their feet, or even their body or leg hairs.

As the flies are vectors of many diseases, the importance of identifying the transmissible agents, the route of transmission, and prevention and treatments in the event of contact are becoming increasingly important. With the ability to lay hundreds of eggs in a lifetime and the presence of thousands of larvae at a time in such close proximity, the potential for transmission is high, especially at ideal temperatures.

=== Pollination ===
Calliphoridae are, alongside managed and wild bees, likely to be the main crop pollinating insect. They visit (and thus may pollinate) flowers of a wide range of plants, including crop plants (e.g. avocado, mango, onion, leek, carrot, cauliflower). Their sponging mouthparts mean that when visiting flowers, their head and upper body must broadly contact the inside of the flower. They have numerous hairs, including on the head and thorax, which may help them carry pollen, and indeed calliphorids in the wild have been observed carrying large amounts of pollen. Compared to honey bees, blow flies are active under a broader range of environmental conditions. However, it is unknown how their pollination abilities compare to those of bees, there are few studies assessing their contribution to pollination, and the exact species that pollinate are often not identified.

==Forensic importance==
Blow flies are usually the first insects to come in contact with carrion because they have the ability to smell dead animal matter from up to away. Upon reaching the carrion, females deposit eggs on it. Since development is highly predictable if the ambient temperature is known, blow flies are considered a valuable tool in forensic science. Blow flies are used forensically to estimate the minimum &quot;post mortem&quot; interval (PMImin) for human corpses. Traditional estimations of time since death are generally unreliable after 72 hours and often entomologists are the only officials capable of generating an accurate approximate time interval. The specialized discipline related to this practice is known as forensic entomology.

In addition to being used to estimate the PMImin, assuming colonization occurred after death, blow fly specimens found infesting a human corpse are used to determine if the corpse was relocated or if the individual ingested narcotics prior to death.

&quot;Calliphora vicina&quot; and &quot;Cynomya mortuorum&quot; are important flies of forensic entomology. Other forensically important Calliphoridae are &quot;Phormia regina&quot;, &quot;Calliphora vomitoria&quot;, &quot;Calliphora livida&quot;, &quot;Lucilia cuprina&quot;, &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot;, &quot;Lucilia illustris&quot;, &quot;Chrysomya rufifacies&quot;, &quot;Chrysomya megacephala&quot;, &quot;Cochliomyia macellaria&quot;, and &quot;Protophormia terraenovae&quot;. One myth states that species from the genus &quot;Lucilia&quot; can sense death and show up right before it even occurs.

<text>HMS &quot;Hasty&quot; was an H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the mid-1930s. She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until the beginning of World War II. The ship transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. &quot;Hasty&quot; returned to the British Isles in early 1940 and covered the evacuation of Allied troops from Namsos in early May 1940 during the Norwegian Campaign. She was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards and participated in the Battle of Calabria and the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March and evacuated British and Australian troops from both Greece and Crete in April and May. In June, &quot;Hasty&quot; participated in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for the next year. During the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942 she defended a convoy from an Italian battleship and several cruisers. While covering another convoy from Alexandria to Malta in June 1942 during Operation Vigorous, &quot;Hasty&quot; was torpedoed by a German motor torpedo boat and was so badly damaged that she had to be scuttled.

==Description==
&quot;Hasty&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hasty&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but this increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hasty&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

Beginning in mid-1940, the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was increased, although when exactly the modifications were made is not known. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a  AA gun and the quadruple .50-calibre Vickers mounts were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon. Two more Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure.

==Service==
&quot;Hasty&quot; was laid down by William Denny and Brothers, of Dumbarton in Scotland on 15 April 1935, launched on 5 May 1936 and completed on 11 November 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,611. She was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Hasty&quot; was refitted in Devonport Dockyard in June–July 1939 and she returned to the Mediterranean afterwards.

&quot;Hasty&quot; escorted convoys between Port Said, Egypt and Gibraltar immediately after World War II began in September. In October the ship was transferred to Freetown to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. The ship and her sisters, , , and , rendezvoused with the battlecruiser , the aircraft carrier , and the light cruiser on 17 December. They refuelled in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship attempted to escape from Montevideo, Uruguay, where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate. &quot;Hasty&quot; was ordered to the UK in January 1940 to refit and captured the German blockade runner SS &quot;Morea&quot; in the North Atlantic on 12 February en route.

The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet after completing her refit in March. Together with the destroyer , &quot;Hasty&quot; escorted the destroyer into Newcastle upon Tyne on 19–20 March after the latter ship had collided with a Swedish merchant ship in the North Sea. Weather damage prevented the ship from participating in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, but she escorted the aircraft carriers and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; from 21 April as their aircraft attacked German targets in Norway. &quot;Hasty&quot; was one of &quot;Glorious&quot;″s escorts when the carrier returned to Scapa Flow to refuel on 27 April. Two days later, the ship escorted the convoy that evacuated British and French troops from Namsos in early May.

&quot;Hasty&quot; and the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla were ordered to the Mediterranean on 16 May, and the ship escorted the and three British cruisers as they bombarded Bardia during the night of 20/21 June. On 9 July &quot;Hasty&quot; participated in the Battle of Calabria as an escort for the heavy ships of Force C and unsuccessfully engaged Italian destroyers and suffered no damage. During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July, the ship escorted Australian light cruiser and rescued some 525 survivors from the together with the other escorting destroyers. &quot;Hasty&quot; and her sister sank the on 2 October off the coast of Egypt and rescued 47 survivors between them. The ship escorted the carrier during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 11/12 November. During the bombardment of Valona, Albania, on the night of 18/19 December, &quot;Hasty&quot; escorted the battleships and .

The ship participated in Operation Excess in January 1941, during which she escorted a convoy and then escorted the battleship from Souda Bay, Crete, to Alexandria. In late February, the ship evacuated British commandos from the island of Kastelorizo, off the coast of Turkey, in the Italian Dodecanese. The commandos had defeated the small garrison in Operation Abstention, but the Italians were able to land troops on the island over the next several days and overwhelm the British forces. During the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28/29 March, &quot;Hasty&quot; escorted the four light cruisers of Force B, but was not seriously engaged during the battle. On 15 April the ship and the light cruiser bombarded Italian positions between Bardia and Fort Capuzzo. In mid-April she escorted the fast transport and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta, before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April. After refuelling in Alexandria on 23 April, &quot;Hasty&quot; sailed for Greece to begin evacuating British and Australian troops from the beaches. On 8 May, the ship again escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they covered another convoy from Alexandria to Malta. &quot;Hasty&quot; escorted the light cruisers and as they intercepted a German convoy attempting to land troops on Crete during the night of 21/22 May. The ship evacuated British and Commonwealth troops from Crete in late May.

&quot;Hasty&quot; bombarded Vichy French positions in Lebanon on 4 July during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign, and then spent most of the rest of the year escorting convoys to Tobruk. On 25 November she was escorting the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet when the battleship &quot;Barham&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by . While escorting a convoy, &quot;Hasty&quot; and her sister, , sank on 23 December north of Sollum. In January 1942, the ship escorted Convoys MF.3 and MF.4 from Alexandria to Malta, but was switched to the covering force for Convoy MF.5 in mid-February. She was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla on 24 February &quot;Hasty&quot; was escorting the merchants ships of Convoy MW.10 when the Second Battle of Sirte began on 22 March, but defended the convoy against the and three cruisers by threatening torpedo attacks from under the cover of a severe storm and a smoke screen. &quot;Hasty&quot; was torpedoed by the German E-Boat &quot;S-55&quot; under the command of &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Horst Weber as she covered a large convoy to Malta during Operation Vigorous, killing 13 men. The torpedo blew off most of the bow structure and both boiler rooms started to flood. &quot;Hotspur&quot; took off her crew and scuttled her with a torpedo during the morning of 15 June 1942.

<doc id="475782" wikidata="Q951170" url="?curid=475782" title="Strike Anywhere">
<text>Strike Anywhere is an American punk rock band from Richmond, Virginia. Formed in 1999 after the demise of frontman Thomas Barnett&#x27;s previous band, Inquisition, they took their name from the Inquisition song &quot;Strike Anywhere&quot;. Their music is characterized by fast tempos, catchy melodies, and emotionally charged vocals delivered via shouting and singing. 

The band received an increased amount of attention after their music appeared in three Tony Hawk video games: &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; in 2003 (&quot;Refusal&quot;), &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; in 2005 (&quot;Question the Answer&quot;), and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Downhill Jam&quot; in 2006 (&quot;The Promise&quot;). They were also featured in the documentary, &quot;Wake Up Screaming&quot;, about the 2005 Vans Warped Tour. 

==History==

The band embarked on their first tour, spanning four weeks from May 29 to June 30, 2000, across the entire United States with Florida melodic hardcore band As Friends Rust. The tour included several cross-over shows with Glasseater, Mid Carson July and The Agency (the three of which were on tour together), as well as stops to play such festivals as Mixed Messages in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Pheer Festival in College Park, Maryland. Strike Anywhere again teamed up with As Friends Rust for their first European and British tour, which spanned five weeks from October 29 to December 5, 2001. A highlight performance at London, England&#x27;s Camden Underworld from midway through the tour, on November 16, 2001, was filmed and later released on video and DVD by British home video company Punkervision in December 2002.

The band played their last show with guitarist Matt Sherwood in Auckland, New Zealand on March 17, 2007, with Mark Miller replacing Sherwood. Since then, the band has continued its regimen of international touring, including the group&#x27;s first South American tour, where they played Brazil and Colombia. In an interview in December 2016, Barnett confirmed that the band is currently working on a fifth studio album. On July 17, 2020 the band released an EP titled &quot;Nightmares of the West&quot; via Pure Noise Records. The EP contained seven newly recorded songs that were the result of ideas that had been exchanged between bandmates over the course of the 2010s decade.

==Political stance==
Strike Anywhere lyrics touch on such issues as police brutality, anti-capitalism, women&#x27;s rights, animal rights, and globalization. They have also contributed tracks to political benefit albums, such as a live version of &quot;Sunset on 32nd&quot; for &quot;1157 Wheeler Avenue: A Memorial for Amadou Diallo&quot; and &quot;To the World&quot; for the &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot; album. According to the liner notes for their album &quot;Change is a Sound&quot;, they support &quot;the vegetarian lifestyle, the living wage movement and the fight against corporate globalization&quot;. With its 2006 release Dead FM, the band expanded their political slogans to address &quot;more sociological ideas about why these (events) happen&quot;.

Their logo is similar to the Three Arrows symbol and the Antifascist Circle, and includes the logo of the former social democracy/antifascist German Iron Front, a paramilitary organization which existed in the last years of the Weimar Republic.

Strike Anywhere generally allows audience members to record their live performances for personal, non-commercial use, and has gone so far as to authorize the Internet Archive to create a section where fans can upload and share their recordings.

<text>HMS &quot;Havock&quot; was an H-class destroyer built for the British Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. During the first few months of the Second World War, &quot;Havock&quot; searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and participated in the First Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 before she was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and the evacuation of Greece in April 1941. She was damaged during the Battle of Crete the following month, but participated in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign in June.

&quot;Havock&quot; began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya until the ship was damaged in October. She was repaired in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the First Battle of Sirte in December and was badly damaged by the Italian battleship &quot;Littorio&quot; whilst protecting another convoy during the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in Malta, but the ship was further damaged in an air raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to Gibraltar for permanent repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, &quot;Havock&quot; ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.

==Description==
&quot;Havock&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Havock&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and ratings in peacetime, but this increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Havock&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the Vickers AA machineguns. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.

===Wartime modifications===
Most ships of &quot;Havock&quot;″s class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, but it is not clear if she received this modification. Other changes may have included exchanging her two quadruple 0.50-calibre Vickers machine gun mounts between her funnels for two Oerlikon AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair on the wings of the bridge.

==Construction and career==
Ordered on 13 December 1934 from William Denny &amp; Brothers, &quot;Havock&quot; was laid down at their shipyard at Dumbarton, Scotland on 15 May 1935. She was launched on 7 July 1936 and completed on 16 January 1937. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,470.

&quot;Havock&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. She patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. On the night of 31 August/1 September 1937, she was unsuccessfully attacked by the with torpedoes, between the Gulf of Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The ship was refitted in Gibraltar between 19 October and 13 November and required repairs between 16 April and 6 May 1938 after hitting the stone side of a quay. &quot;Havock&quot; was given a brief refit at Sheerness Dockyard between 15 and 26 August 1939 before returning to Gibraltar.

===World War II===
The ship sailed to Freetown, Sierra Leone on 30 August and arrived on 4 September to search for German commerce raiders. She was transferred back to the UK in November for a more thorough refit at Sheerness between 18 December and 23 March 1940. In the meantime, the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla had been assigned to the Home Fleet and &quot;Havock&quot; rejoined them when her refit was finished. On 6 April &quot;Havock&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer minelayers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers joined the battlecruiser and her escorts.

During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April 1940, &quot;Havock&quot; and four other H-class ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla attacked the German destroyers that had transported German troops to occupy Narvik in northern Norway the previous day. The flotilla leader led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. and were initially left at the entrance, but &quot;Havock&quot; was third into the harbour and fired five of her torpedoes into the mass of shipping. One torpedo hit the in the stern. In addition, the ship hit twice with shells. As the British ships were withdrawing, they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set &quot;Hardy&quot; on fire and forced her to run aground. &quot;Havock&quot; was next in line and fired torpedoes at the German destroyers, but they all missed. She was hit in return, but not significantly damaged. In the confusion and limited visibility, &quot;Havock&quot; pulled out of the line to find out what happened to &quot;Hardy&quot; and to protect the rear of the British formation from the other three German destroyers in pursuit, but then had to then to turn again to allow her rear guns to fire when her forward guns failed. &quot;Havock&quot; and &quot;Hostile&quot; turned back to protect their badly damaged sister, &quot;Hotspur&quot;, and all three continued to withdraw down the Ofotfjord. En route, they encountered the German supply ship &quot;Rauenfels&quot;, loaded with artillery and ammunition, whose crew ran her aground and abandoned ship after &quot;Hostile&quot; fired at the ship. A boarding party from &quot;Havock&quot; found the ship on fire and she blew up after the ship fired two shells into her. The ship remained in Norwegian waters until May, when she escorted the light cruiser on an unsuccessful sweep of the North Sea looking for German ships, early in the month.
&quot;Havock&quot; was assigned to the Nore Command shortly afterwards and bombarded German troops occupying Waalhaven Airfield on 10 May together with her sister . She rescued survivors from the sunken ferry &quot;Prinses Juliana&quot; off the Dutch coast and returned them to the Hook of Holland where she recovered a number of British demolition parties. On 16 May, the ship was ordered to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta and was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July, the ship escorted the Australian light cruiser and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the together with the other escorting destroyers. Her boiler room was flooded after an attack by Italian aircraft after this battle and she was repaired at Suez from 29 July to 15 September. &quot;Havock&quot; and her sister surprised the on the surface on 2 October off the coast of Egypt and forced her to scuttle herself. The destroyers rescued 47 survivors between them.

&quot;Havock&quot; was engaged on escort duties for the next six months, including escorting the carrier during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 11/12 November, aside from a refit in Malta from 22 December to 20 February 1941. During the Battle of Cape Matapan, she torpedoed and sank the on 28 March. The ship evacuated Commonwealth troops from Greece at the end of April and was one of three destroyers escorting the light cruiser when they bombarded Benghazi on the night of 7/8 May. &quot;Havock&quot; was damaged by dive bombers on 23 May, killing 15 and wounding 10 men, after a patrol off Heraklion, Crete. She was under repair at Alexandria until 16 June. The ship bombarded Vichy French positions in Lebanon in early July and then began escorting ships to Tobruk until October when her propeller shafts and propellers were damaged. &quot;Havock&quot; was under repair from 21 October to 4 December at Alexandria.

In mid-December, the ship escorted the supply ship to Malta during the brief engagement known as First Battle of Sirte and then joined Force K in an attempt to intercept an Italian convoy to Tripoli, Libya. On the night of 18/19 December, the reinforced Force K ran over an Italian minefield that sank one cruiser and damaged two others. &quot;Havock&quot; escorted the badly damaged light cruiser back to Malta. &quot;Havock&quot; was one of four destroyers that escorted &quot;Breconshire&quot; back to Alexandria in early January 1942. Whilst escorting another convoy to Malta, the ship was diverted to escort the damaged freighter &quot;Thermoplylae&quot; from Benghazi back to Alexandria but the latter was attacked and sunk en route by Axis aircraft on 19 January. &quot;Havock&quot; rescued some 350 survivors before &quot;Thermoplylae&quot; sank.

The ship was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in February and continued to escort convoys to Malta. On 22 March 1942, several splinters from a 15-inch (38 cm) near miss from the Italian battleship &quot;Littorio&quot; perforated one of her boilers during the Second Battle of Sirte, killing eight men. &quot;Havock&quot; was forced to make for Malta for repairs. Whilst in dock, the ship was a target for Axis aircraft and sustained some damage on 3 April and was ordered to Gibraltar before her repairs were complete. &quot;Havock&quot; ran aground off Kelibia, Tunisia, in the Strait of Sicily on 6 April and was wrecked, with one crewman killed in the incident. Her crew and passengers were interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara but were released in November as a result of Operation Torch. Her wreck was later torpedoed by the Italian submarine &quot;Aradam&quot;.

<text>Bob and Margaret is an adult animated sitcom created by David Fine and Alison Snowden and co-produced by Nelvana Limited and Channel 4 as a collaboration, both financial and artistic, between the United Kingdom and Canada. The last two seasons were co-produced without Channel 4 but with continuing British involvement in the animation, cast, and screenwriting. The series was based on the Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Bob&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, featuring the same main characters, which won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar in 1994. In Canada, it was the highest-rated Canadian-made animated series ever when it aired in primetime on Global.

The show revolves around a married English couple named Bob and Margaret Fish. They are a middle-class professional working couple of forty-ish with no children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth, who often serve as surrogates for children and are considered to be characters with personalities in their own right. Bob is a dentist and Margaret is a chiropodist.

==Premise==
Bob and Margaret struggle with everyday issues and mid-life crises. Stories often revolve around the mundane, but in a way that is eminently relatable, from the trials of shopping to dealing with friends who annoy them but owe them a dinner. They are often seen enjoying various takeaways – curries, various Chinese dishes, and especially pizza - as they navigate their lazy, sedentary homelives.

In the first two seasons, Bob and Margaret live in England, in the South London community of Balham. For the third and fourth seasons, they move to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, allowing the writers to explore the humour of the culture clash. The move was mandated by the realities of funding after Channel 4 backed out, with certain Canadian grants and tax benefits being dependent on stories being physically based in Canada. As such, the transition was necessary to finance the show&#x27;s continued production. Fine and Snowden chose to take an executive role on these latter two seasons, reviewing scripts and consulting, but not involved in as granular detail as they were for the first two seasons. Snowden continued to provide Margaret&#x27;s voice, but Brian George replaced Andy Hamilton as Bob&#x27;s voice.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

* Bob Fish (voiced by Andy Hamilton in Season 1 and 2, Brian George in Season 3 and 4): an English dentist working in South London in the district of Clapham. He is the husband of Margaret and his parents are Daisy and Cesal Fish. Bob&#x27;s brother Peter is a successful world-class television chef, and his sister Susan is a recent divorcée and single mother. His father is deceased and only appears in flashbacks. His mother is still alive and very mean-spirited toward Bob but showers admiration and adoration on Peter. Throughout the series Bob is portrayed as the kindest, most understanding member of his family, but there are times he is arrogant and ignorant. In Season 3, he is forced to emigrate with Margaret to Toronto in order to secure legal custody of their dogs William and Elizabeth. He later becomes the primary dentist at the Inner City Dental clinic. 
* Margaret Fish (voiced by Alison Snowden): Bob&#x27;s wife, an English chiropodist working in South London. Her parents, Tony and Maureen Heslop, greatly adore her husband Bob but show little to no respect for their own daughter Margaret, who silently resents them for it. She is caring and very passive, which leads other people to take advantage of her, but she learns to stand up for herself when the occasion calls for it. At one time she was accidentally classified as a terrorist by the London police department, who even attempted to assassinate her until they were informed that she was innocent. In Season 3, she is forced to emigrate to Toronto with Bob where she becomes the lead podiatrist at the Women&#x27;s Clinic. Margaret has appeared in every episode with Bob.

The series depicts them as being proud Canadians who always need to compare Toronto to London (and once to New York City, in &quot;Stranded in Toronto&quot;) with Toronto always coming out far ahead. They love and adore Bob and Margaret but unknowingly annoy them on numerous occasions, for example playing their vacation videos about their visits to London, which turn up all the hilarious, humiliating moments of their taping Bob and Margaret at their worst times. The couple have two aggressive cats named Buster and Bailey. They first appeared in the episode &quot;The Discomfort of Strangers&quot; in Season 1 and return as minors in Seasons 3 and 4. 
* Heather (voiced by Vickie Papavs): Heather is a secretary at the Inner City Dental Clinic working in Bob&#x27;s dental office in Toronto and has similar attributes to Penny in terms of facial expression but is kinder and less judgmental with a carefree attitude.
* Ed, Patel, and Audra: Ed and Patel are two other dentists working at the Inner City Dental Clinic with Bob. Ed is a defined as a Canadian woodsman; Patel is an Indian hygienist who encourages Bob to take on challenges for success.

<doc id="475787" wikidata="Q1414323" url="?curid=475787" title="Northwestern Europe">
<text>Northwestern Europe, or Northwest Europe, is a loosely defined subregion of Europe, overlapping Northern and Western Europe. The term is used in geographic, history, and military contexts.

==Geographic definitions==
Geographically, Northwestern Europe is given by some sources as a region which includes Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Northern France, parts of or all of Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. In some works, Switzerland, Finland, and Austria are also included as part of Northwestern Europe.

Under the Interreg program, funded by the European Regional Development Fund, &quot;North-West Europe&quot; (NWE) is a region of European Territorial Cooperation that includes Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and parts of France and Germany.

==Ethnography==
During the Reformation, some parts of Northwestern Europe converted to Protestantism, in a manner which differentiated the region from its Roman Catholic neighbors elsewhere in Europe.

A definition of Northwestern Europe was used by some late 19th to mid-20th century anthropologists, eugenicists, and Nordicists, who used the term as a shorthand term for the part of Europe with a predominantly Nordic population. For example, Arthur de Gobineau, the 19th-century aristocrat who published works on the pseudoscience of scientific racism, included parts of Northwestern Europe in what Leon Baradat described as his &quot;Aryan heaven&quot;.

==Genetics==
There is close genetic affinity among some Northwest European populations, with some of these populations descending from Bell Beaker populations carrying steppe ancestry. For example, the Beaker people of the lower Rhine overturned 90% of Great Britain&#x27;s gene pools, replacing the Basque-like neolithic populations present prior.

<doc id="475788" wikidata="Q978302" url="?curid=475788" title="Flesh fly">
<text>Sarcophagidae () are a family of flies commonly known as flesh flies. They differ from most flies in that they are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals, hence their common name. Some flesh fly larvae are internal parasites of other insects such as Orthoptera, and some, in particular the Miltogramminae, are kleptoparasites of solitary Hymenoptera. The adults mostly feed on fluids from animal bodies, nectar, sweet foods, fluids from animal waste and other organic substances. Juveniles need protein to develop and may be laid on carrion, dung or sweet plant foods (including fruit, nuts, and artificial foodstuffs).

==Diagnostic characteristics==


Members of the subfamily Sarcophaginae are small to large flies with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the thorax and checkering on the abdomen. Other key features include red eyes and a bristled abdomen. Abdominal sternites II and III are free and cover the margins of tergites. The posthumeral bristles are one or two in number, with the outermost pair missing.

The presutural bristle is located lower than the notopleural bristle, and closer to the notopleural bristle than to the outermost posthumeral bristle. The presutural bristle is located higher than or level with the posthumeral bristle. The hindmost posthumeral bristle is located even with or toward the midline from the presutural bristle. Four notopleural bristles are present and arranged in the order - short, long, short, long - from front to rear.

Vein M1 +2 (anterior transverse vein, medial vein 1+2 ) is always present, and the cubitulus is strongly bent at right angles or acute; vein Rs is dibranched.

The eyes are smooth and very rarely hairy.

The arista is plumose in its basal half, or rarely pubescent or glabrous.

==Taxonomy==

The family contains three subfamilies, the Miltogramminae, the Paramacronychiinae, and the Sarcophaginae, containing between them 108 genera. About 2500 species are in this family.

==Biology==

Sarcophaginae : 
The majority of species in the large genus &quot;Sarcophaga&quot; are scavengers of small carrion, such as dead insects and snails or smaller vertebrates. A few species feed on larger vertebrate carcasses. Flesh fly maggots occasionally eat other larvae, although this is usually because the other larvae are smaller and get in the way. Flesh flies and their larvae are also known to eat decaying vegetable matter and excrement, and they may be found around compost piles and pit latrines.

Miltogramminae : 
Members of this subfamily are kleptoparasites of solitary bees and solitary wasps.

Paramacronychiinae : 
This subfamily includes lepidopteran predators or parasitoids (&quot;Agria&quot;), predators on immatures (mainly prepupae) of bumblebees (&quot;Brachicoma&quot;) and generalist scavengers and insect predators (&quot;Sarcophila&quot; and &quot;Wohlfahrtia&quot;).

==Association with disease==

Flesh flies can carry leprosy bacilli and can transmit intestinal pseudomyiasis to people who eat their larvae. Flesh flies, particularly &quot;Wohlfahrtia magnifica&quot;, can also cause myiasis in animals, mostly to sheep, and can give them blood poisoning, or asymptomatic leprosy infections.

== Identification ==
Generally, only males of this family can reliably be identified to species, and then only by examination of dissected genitalia. The literature is incomplete or scattered for all regions. References include:

<doc id="475802" wikidata="Q17510" url="?curid=475802" title="West Highland White Terrier">
<text>The West Highland White Terrier (commonly shortened to Westie) is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat and somewhat soft white undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, though with longer legs than other Scottish terriers. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog&#x27;s face, giving it a rounded appearance.

The Westie is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. It is an energetic, boisterous, and social breed with a high prey drive, having been bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms, and needs regular exercise of around one hour per day. The modern breed is descended from a number of pre-20th century breeding programmes of white terriers in Scotland. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier but did not want to be known as such.

A cousin of the Cairn Terrier, other related breeds included the Roseneath Terrier (bred by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll) and Pittenweem Terriers (bred by Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman). The Westie was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time. The breed remains very popular in the United Kingdom, with multiple wins at Cruft&#x27;s, and has been in the top third of all breeds in the United States since the 1960s. Several breed-specific and non-specific health problems appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed &quot;Westie jaw&quot;, which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring.

==Appearance==

Westies commonly have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect. Members of the breed typically weigh between with an average height between at the withers. The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.

Westies have a deep chest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short closely-fitted jaw with &quot;scissors&quot; bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors). Their paws are slightly turned out to give them better grip than flat-footed breeds when they climb on rocky surfaces. Young puppies have pink markings on the nose and footpads that slowly turn black as they age. Westies also have short and sturdy tails. Unconfirmed sources suggest that, due to their history as rodent catchers, their tails were bred to be thick so that a Westie trapped in a hole could be easily pulled out by the tail.

Westies have a rough outer coat that can grow to about long and a soft, dense, thick undercoat. The fur fills out the face to give it a rounded appearance. As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either &quot;hand-stripping&quot; (especially for dog-showing) or otherwise clipping. Most Westies are pure white, although there are some light wheaten colour variations.

==Temperament==

The temperament of Westies can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children and others preferring solitude. They will not typically tolerate rough handling, such as a child pulling on their ears or fur, and can frequently be both food- and toy-possessive. This makes regular training from a young age particularly important. Westies can make good watchdogs and are normally independent, self-assured, and confident. They are loyal and bond with their owner but are often on the move, requiring a minimum of one hour of daily exercise. Westies are highly social and are the most friendly of all the Scottish terriers.

A hardy breed, Westies can be stubborn and cause issues with training, potentially requiring their training to be refreshed on occasion during their lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, they tend to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. They retain the instincts of an &quot;earthdog&quot; such as being inquisitive and investigative, as well as natural instincts to bark and dig holes. Westies are tied for 47th place (with the Scottish Deerhound) in Stanley Coren&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, which designates them as being of &quot;average working/obedience intelligence&quot; and places them almost exactly in the middle of the list.

A 2015 French study found a life expectancy of 12.93 years, while 2024 British study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years (averaging 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds). The typical litter size is between three and five puppies.

The breed is pre-disposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias. Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as &quot;lion jaw&quot;, and is sometimes also referred to as &quot;Westie jaw&quot;. The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both of its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under one year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary.

The breed is prone to skin disorders. About one quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers of any age. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and alopecia. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as an allergy or less serious forms of dermatitis.
An inherited genetic problem that exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is &quot;white dog shaker syndrome&quot;. As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other non-white breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.

Other less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog&#x27;s urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed is also one of the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place. The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

Hyperplastic dermatosis of the West Highland White Terrier, also known as epidermal dysplasia or colloquially Armadillo Westie Syndrome, is an uncommon condition exclusively identified in the Westie. It is a severe chronic hyperplastic dermatological disease that is similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis and primary seborrhoea. Due to the fact that it is identified only in Westies, and evidence of familial involvement, it is believed to be an inherited trait. &quot;Malassezia&quot; infection is associated with the onset or worsening of symptoms. Symptoms involve generalised and serious patches of alopecia, erythema, lichenification, hyperpigmentation, malodor, otitis externa, and pruritus.

A 2021 British study looking at clinical records found predispositions to chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular death, caused by either toxins or acute liver failure; compared to other dogs, Westies are 3.23 times more likely to contract chronic hepatitis and 3.87 times more likely to contract hepatocelluar death. Copper storage diseases which affect the breed can result in chronic hepatitis.

==History==

Scottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen of these white terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed&#x27;s existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.

Reports of a ship from the Spanish Armada being wrecked on the island of Skye in 1588 indicated the ship carried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other breeds by Clan Donald, including the families of the Chiefs. Other families on Skye preserved both white and sandy-coloured dogs. One such family was the Clan MacLeod, and it was reported by their descendants that at least two Chiefs kept white terriers, including &quot;The Wicked Man&quot; Norman MacLeod, and his grandson Norman, who became Chief after his death.

George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers known as the &quot;Roseneath Terrier&quot;. Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of &quot;Pittenweem Terriers&quot; out of a female Scottish Terrier which produced white offspring. The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He re-dedicated his breeding programme to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century.

The person most closely associated with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the &quot;Poltalloch Terrier&quot;. The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed. It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred. In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed. The term &quot;West Highland White Terrier&quot; first appears in &quot;Otters and Otter Hunting&quot; by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.

The first breed club was set up in 1904; Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, was the society&#x27;s first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the Countess of Aberdeen as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club&#x27;s second chairman. Kennel Club recognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at Crufts for the first time in the same year. The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907–1908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year to the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. The breed spent the period that immediately followed as being &quot;in vogue&quot;, becoming popular almost immediately upon its arrival in the US. Canadian Kennel Club recognition followed in 1909. Until 1924 in the UK, Westie pedigrees were allowed to have Cairn and Scottish Terriers in them. By the time of Malcolm&#x27;s death in 1930, a stable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat, and a short back.
In major conformation shows, the breed has been equally successful on both sides of the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time as a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at the age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised independently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was reregistered as a West Highland White Terrier. The first win at a major show came at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1942 when Constance Winant&#x27;s Ch. Wolvey Pattern of Edgerstoune won the title of Best in Show. The same title was taken by Barbara Worcester&#x27;s Ch. Elfinbrook Simon in 1962. It took a further 14 years before the breed took its first Best in Show title at Crufts, the UK&#x27;s major dog show. Ch. Dianthus Buttons, owned by Kath Newstead and Dorothy Taylor, took the title for the breed in 1976. A Westie also won Crufts in 1990 with the Best in Show title going to Derek Tattersall&#x27;s Ch. Olac Moon Pilot, and in 2016 to Burneze Geordie Girl.

The popularity of the breed during the early 20th century was such that dogs were being exchanged for hundreds of guineas. As of 2010, the Westie is the third-most popular breed of terrier in the UK, with 5,361 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. However, this is a decrease in numbers since 2001, when it was the most popular terrier breed, with 11,019 new dogs registered. The breed&#x27;s position in the United States is more stable with it remaining in the top third of all breeds since around 1960. It was ranked 30th-most popular in 2001, based on registrations with the American Kennel Club, which varied around the 30s in the decade after, with it ranked 34th in 2010. It was the 44th-most popular AKC breed in 2020.

<text>Fausto Veranzio (; ; Hungarian and Vernacular Latin: &quot;Verancsics Faustus&quot;; 1551 – 20 January 1617) was a Croatian polymath, diplomat and bishop from Šibenik, then part of the Republic of Venice. He is a scientist recognised for his genius as both a Croatian and as a Croatian-Hungarian.

==Life==

===Family history===

Fausto was born in Sebenico (Šibenik), Venetian Dalmatia into the Croatian family of count Michele/Mihovil Vrančić (Veranzio) and Katarina Berislavić. His father was a Latin poet, while his uncle was Antun Vrančić, archbishop of Esztergom (1504–1573), a diplomat and a civil servant, who was in touch with Erasmus (1465–1536), Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560), and Nikola IV Zrinski (1508–1566), who took care of Fausto&#x27;s education and later travelled with him during some of Antun&#x27;s travels through Hungary and in the Republic of Venice. Faust had a brother Kazimir (1557-1637).

While the family&#x27;s main residence was in the city of Šibenik, they owned a big summer house on island of Prvić, in place of Šepurine, a neighboring place to Prvić-Luka (where he is buried in the local church). The Baroque castle that was used by the Vrančić family as summer residence is now in possession of the Draganić family. Later in his life, in 1578, Fausto was married to Marieta Zar with whom had a daughter Alba-Roza, and possibly a son, who died young.

===Education and political activities===
As a youth, under Antun&#x27;s tutelage, Veranzio was interested in science. While still a child, he moved to Venice, where he attended school, and then to Padua to join the University, where he focused on law, physics, engineering and mechanics.

At the court of King Rudolf II, at the Hradčany castle in Prague, Veranzio was the chancellor for Hungary and Transylvania, often in contact with Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe. After his wife&#x27;s death, Veranzio left for Hungary. In 1598, he received the title of bishop of Csanád (&quot;Episcŏpus Csanadiensis&quot;) &quot;in partibus&quot; (even though he never set foot in Csanád). In 1609, back in Venice, he joined the brotherhood of Paul of Tarsus (barnabites) and committed himself to the study of science. Veranzio died in 1617 in Venice and was buried in Dalmatia, near his family&#x27;s country house on the island of Prvić.

==Polymath and inventor==
Veranzio&#x27;s masterwork, &quot;Machinae Novae&quot; (Venice 1615 or 1616), contained 49 large pictures depicting 56 different machines, other devices, and technical concepts.

Two variants of this work exist, one with the &quot;Declaratio&quot; in Latin and Italian, the other with the addition of three other languages. Only a few copies survived and they often do not present a complete text in all the five languages. This book was written in Italian, Spanish, French, and German. The tables represent a varied set of the projects, designs, and conceptions of the author. There Veranzio wrote about water and solar energy, offering depictions of clocks, including a &quot;universal clock&quot; (Plates 6–7), many types of mills, agricultural machinery, various types of bridges in various materials, machinery for clearing the sea, a dual sedan chair borne by a mule (Plate 47), special coaches, and &quot;Homo Volans&quot; (Plate 38), a forerunner of the parachute. His ideas included a float resembling a modern lifebuoy (Plate 39), boats with ingenious power mechanisms relying on water currents (Plates 40 and 41), and a rotary printer (Plate 46) intended to improve on the printing press.

Despite the extraordinary rarity of this book (because the author published it at his own expense, without a publisher, and had to stop printing for want of funds), the &quot;Machinae Novae&quot; was the work which mainly contributed to Veranzio&#x27;s popularity around the world. His design pictures were even reprinted a few years later and published in China.

===Veranzio&#x27;s parachute===

One of the illustrations in &quot;Machinae Novae&quot; is a sketch of a parachute dubbed &quot;Homo Volans&quot; (&quot;The Flying Man&quot;). Having examined Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s rough sketches of a parachute, Veranzio designed one of his own. Paolo Guidotti had already attempted to carry out the idea, ending by falling on a house roof and breaking his thigh bone (about 1590); but while Francis Godwin was writing his flying romance &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;, Fausto Veranzio is widely believed to have performed an actual parachute-jumping experiment and, therefore, to be the first man to build and test a parachute. According to legend, Veranzio, in 1617, at over sixty-five years of age, implemented his parachute design and tested it by jumping from St Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice. This event was documented some 30 years later in the book &quot;Mathematical Magick or, the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry&quot; (London, 1648), written by John Wilkins, the secretary of the Royal Society in London.

But in his book, where Wilkins wrote about flying and the possibility of human flight, methods of slowing down people&#x27;s fall through the air were not his concern. His treatise does not even mention Veranzio by name, nor does it document any jump by parachute or any event at all in 1617. No evidence has ever been found of any test of Veranzio&#x27;s parachute.

===Mills and wind turbines===

His areas of interest in engineering and mechanics were broad. Mills were one of his main point of research, where he created 18 different designs. He envisioned windmills with both vertical and horizontal axes, with different wing constructions to improve their efficiency. The idea of a mill powered by tides incorporated accumulation pools filled with water by the high tide and emptied when the tide ebbed, simply using gravity; the concept has just recently been engineered and used. The first wind turbines were described by Fausto Veranzio. In his book Machinae Novae (1616) he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or V-shaped blades.

===Urbanist and engineer in Rome and Venice===
By order of the Pope, he spent two years in Rome where he envisioned and made projects needed for regulating rivers, since Rome was often flooded by the Tiber river. He also tackled the problem of the wells and water supply of Venice, which is surrounded by sea. Devices to register the time using water, fire, or other methods were envisioned and materialized. His own sun clock was effective in reading the time, date, and month, but functioned only in the middle of the day.
The construction method of building metal bridges and the mechanics of the forces in the area of statics were also part of his research. He drew proposals which predated the actual construction of modern suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges by over two centuries. The last area was described when further developed in a separate book by mathematician Simon de Bruges (Simon Stevin) in 1586. Veranzio also designed the concept to modern tied-arch bridges, through arch bridges, truss bridges and aerial lifts.

===Lexicography===

Veranzio was the author of a five-language dictionary, &quot;Dictionarium quinque nobilissimarum Europæ linguarum, Latinæ, Italicæ, Germanicæ, Dalmatiæ, &amp; Vngaricæ&quot;, published in Venice in 1595, with 5,000 entries for each language: Latin, Italian, German, the Dalmatian vernacular (in particular, the chakavian dialect of Croatian) and Hungarian. These he called the &quot;five noblest European languages&quot; (&quot;quinque nobilissimarum Europæ linguarum&quot;).

The &quot;Dictionarium&quot; is a very early and significant example of both Croatian and Hungarian lexicography, and contains, in addition to the parallel list of vocabulary, other documentation of these two languages. In particular, Veranzio listed in the &quot;Dictionarium&quot; 304 Hungarian words that he deemed to be borrowed from Croatian. Also, at the end of the book, Veranzio included Croatian language versions of the Ten Commandments, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Ave Maria and the Apostles&#x27; Creed.

In an extension of the dictionary called &quot;Vocabula dalmatica quae Ungri sibi usurparunt&quot;, there is a list of Proto-Croatian words that entered the Hungarian language. The book greatly influenced the formation of both the Croatian and Hungarian orthography; the Hungarian language accepted his suggestions, for example, the usage of &quot;ly&quot;, &quot; ny&quot;, &quot;sz&quot;, and &quot;cz&quot;. It was also the first dictionary of the Hungarian language, printed four times, in Venice, Prague (1606), Pozsony (1834), and in Zagreb (1971). The work was an important source of inspiration for other European dictionaries such as a Hungarian and Italian dictionary written by Bernardino Baldi, a German &quot;Thesaurus polyglottus&quot; by humanist and lexicographer Hieronymus Megiser, and multilingual &quot;Dictionarium septem diversarum linguarum&quot; by Peterus Lodereckerus of Prague in 1605.

===History and philosophy===
Only a few of Veranzio&#x27;s works related to history remain: &quot;Regulae cancellariae regni Hungariae&quot; and &quot;De Slavinis seu Sarmatis in Dalmatia&quot; exist in manuscript form, while &quot;Scriptores rerum hungaricum&quot; was published in 1798. In &quot;Logica nova&quot; (&quot;New logic&quot;) and &quot;Ethica christiana&quot; (&quot;Christian ethics&quot;), which were published in a single Venetian edition in 1616, Veranzio dealt with the problems of theology regarding the ideological clash between the Reformation movement and Catholicism. Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639) and the Archbishop of Split Marco Antonio de Dominis (1560–1624) were his intellectual counterparts.

==Legacy==
When Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951), Austrian-British philosopher and mathematician, moving from Berlin to England, began studying mechanical engineering in 1908, he was highly influenced by his reading of Renaissance technical treatises, particularly Veranzio&#x27;s &quot;Machinae Novae&quot;.

The 17th century &quot;Brooklyn Tidal Mill&quot; in Long Island (NY), one of the most popular and few still standing mills in the New York City area, was built after the plan of Fausto Veranzio.

In 1965, &quot;&quot;Faust Vrančić&quot; Astronomy Society&quot; was founded in Šibenik.

In 1969, the medallion with his figure, work by Kosta Angeli Radovani, was embedded in the rector&#x27;s chain of the University of Zagreb.

In 1992, the Croatian Parliament established the &quot;&quot;Faust Vrančić&quot; National Award for Technical Culture&quot; which is awarded to individuals, associations and other legal persons for outstanding achievements in technical culture.

In 1993, his bust was erected at the Nikola Tesla Technical Museum&#x27;s &quot;Sculpture Garden of the Croatian Geniuses of Science and Technology&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Faust Vrančić Memorial Centre &quot; was opened on the island of Prvić where visitors can learn more about Veranzio&#x27;s life and see his most famous inventions.

Croatian Navy&#x27;s rescue ship BS-73, as well as many schools and streets in Croatia, were named after him.

Cultural event &quot;Days of Faust Vrančić&quot; is held annually in Šibenik.

<doc id="475805" wikidata="Q2253861" url="?curid=475805" title="Pansy Division">
<text>Pansy Division is an American queercore band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1991 by guitarist/singer/songwriter Jon Ginoli along with bassist Chris Freeman.

Conceived as the first openly gay rock band featuring predominantly gay musicians, Pansy Division&#x27;s music, a mix of pop punk and power pop, focuses mainly on LGBT issues, sex and relationships, often presented in a humorous light. In 1992, the band signed to punk label Lookout! Records and received international notoriety touring with Green Day in 1994, becoming the most commercially successful band of the queercore movement which began in the 1980s.

Pansy Division has released seven studio albums and three B-side compilations, among other recordings. In 2008, the band was the subject of a documentary film entitled &quot;Pansy Division: Life in a Gay Rock Band&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Frustrated by the lack of openly gay rock musicians, Jon Ginoli started performing solo sets under the moniker Pansy Division (a pun on Panzer division and a commonly-used anti-gay slur &quot;pansy&quot;) around San Francisco. Shortly after this, in 1991, Ginoli placed an ad in the San Francisco Weekly looking for &quot;gay musicians into the Ramones, Buzzcocks and early Beatles&quot;. This caught the attention of Chris Freeman, who joined the band as a bassist. Ginoli and Freeman then recruited drummer Jay Paget, forming the first entirely out gay rock band that any of them had known. They hoped to defy the stereotype that gay men preferred pop divas and showtunes, by playing punk rock music.

=== Lookout! years (1993–2000) ===
Following extensive touring in California, several 7&quot; singles and compilation appearances, Pansy Division signed to Lookout! Records, released their first album, &quot;Undressed&quot; in March 1993. They then embarked on their first national tour.

In 1994, with the release of their second album &quot;Deflowered&quot; and an appearance on Outpunk&#x27;s seminal compilation &quot;Outpunk Dance Party&quot;, the band had proven themselves to be one of the more prolific and well-known artists to spring from the budding queercore movement. Catching the wave of pop punk&#x27;s mainstream explosion, Pansy Division were asked to tour with Green Day on the band&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Dookie&quot; tour, introducing the group and queercore to a larger audience. During the tour&#x27;s New York stop, the band caught the attention of Howard Stern, who met them backstage, and spent a segment talking about them on his nationally syndicated radio show.

While signed to Lookout!, the band continued to release an album every year. In 1995, Pansy Division released the album &quot;Pile Up&quot; notable for its various cover songs, included Ned Sublette&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other&quot; and Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (covered as &quot;Smells Like Queer Spirit&quot;).
During their tour of eastern Canada in 1995, the band took a set of underwear shots in an old hotel, and produced a set of Pansy Division trading cards that were used as promotional materials for the next album. In 1996, the album &quot;Wish I&#x27;d Taken Pictures&quot; featured the single &quot;I Really Wanted You&quot;. The music video for this single aired once on MTV. In 1997, the album &quot;More Lovin&#x27; From Our Oven&quot; collected a large number of B-sides that the band had already released as singles.

During this period, Pansy Division primarily performed as a trio, with Freeman and Ginoli being the only constant members amid a slew of perpetually rotating drummers, both gay and straight. In 1996, the band finally found a permanent gay drummer in the form of Luis Illades. In 1997, the band became a quartet with the addition of lead guitarist Patrick Goodwin.

1998 saw the release of Pansy Division&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Absurd Pop Song Romance&quot;, a departure from earlier Pansy work that featured less humorous, more introspective lyrics and a darker, two-guitar layered alternative rock sound. The band was again taken on tour by a mainstream punk band, when they opened for Rancid on their 1998 &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; tour.

=== Alternative Tentacles years (2001–present) ===

In 2001, Pansy Division was finally ready to record another album, but the lack of support from Lookout! caused the band to leave their long-time label and sign with Alternative Tentacles later that year. What resulted was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Total Entertainment!&quot;, an album that the band described as a meeting point between the lighthearted humor of their early work and the introspective rock of their previous album. Goodwin left the band the following year, being temporarily replaced by Bernard Yin and then by former Mr. T Experience member Joel Reader.

Following the release of &quot;Total Entertainment&quot;, Pansy Division&#x27;s active touring and recording schedule declined as most of the members relocated to different parts of the country. The band continued to perform sporadically, usually at various gay pride festivals or local shows in San Francisco. In 2006, Alternative Tentacles released &quot;The Essential Pansy Division&quot;, a comprehensive &#x27;best-of&#x27; compilation featuring thirty tracks picked by Ginoli and a DVD of various video footage. This compilation was motivated by the longer period of inactivity, and the idea that Pansy Division might be over.

However, in 2007, Pansy Division launched their first national tour since 2003 with reformed San Francisco punk band the Avengers, whose line-up featured both Illades and Reader. Then, in 2008, the band became the subject of a documentary film entitled &quot;Pansy Division: Life in a Gay Rock Band&quot;, directed by Michael Carmona. The film toured internationally, playing at various LGBT film festivals; it was released on DVD in 2009 and later also on YouTube.

2009 also saw the release of Pansy Division&#x27;s seventh studio album, titled &quot;That&#x27;s So Gay&quot;, a live DVD, another national tour, and Ginoli&#x27;s memoirs, a biography of the band entitled &quot;Deflowered: My Life in Pansy Division&quot;. The album was put together largely remotely, as band members worked from different cities.

After a seven-year break from recording, Pansy Division returned in 2016 with &quot;Quite Contrary&quot;. This album includes a holiday song about being single on New Year&#x27;s Eve &quot;Kiss Me at Midnight (New Year&#x27;s Eve)&quot;; a song about internet dating &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot;; as well as a poignant break-up song &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;. Jon has performed &quot;Kiss Me at Midnight (New Year&#x27;s Eve)&quot; solo, since the band members live in different cities. The single released with this album is &quot;Blame the Bible&quot; (A-side) / &quot;Neighbors of the Beast&quot; (B-side). A music video was also produced for the song &quot;Blame the Bible&quot;.

In 2017, Pansy Division was included in the documentary film &quot;&quot; directed by Yony Leyser.

In November 2022, Pansy Division released a video for the 30th anniversary of their first single, &quot;Fem in a Black Leather Jacket&quot;; that video is available on their YouTube channel. In March 2023, they also released a series of three interviews for the 30th anniversary of the release of their first album &quot;Undressed&quot;. Those interviews featured discussions with the cover model Alex Fazekas-Paul, recording engineer Kent Whitesell, and Lookout! Records&#x27; Larry Livermore. In the summer of 2023 they also have planned a short US tour for the anniversary.

In interviews, Ginoli has said that he plans to release a solo album eventually. Chris Freeman has recently been touring with the AC/DC cover band &quot;GayC/DC&quot;. In July 2022, Pansy Division played the Mosswood Meltdown, a large outdoor music festival in Oakland, California. As of May 2023, Pansy Division has played 976 shows. Pansy Division continues to play shows in 2023 as they inch toward their goal of having played 1,000 shows. The band has begun reissuing remastered versions of their first three albums on colored vinyl, beginning with &#x27;Undressed&#x27; in 2024.
