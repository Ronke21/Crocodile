<text>Cumorah (; also known as The Sacred Grove is a drumlin in Palmyra, New York, United States, where Joseph Smith said he found a set of golden plates which he translated into English and published as the Book of Mormon.

In the text of the Book of Mormon, &quot;Cumorah&quot; is a hill located in a land of the same name, which is &quot;a land of many waters, rivers and fountains&quot;. In this hill, a Book of Mormon figure, Mormon, deposited a number of metal plates containing the record of his nation of Nephites, just prior to their final battle with the Lamanites in which at least 230,000 people were killed.

Early Latter Day Saints assumed that the Cumorah in New York was the same Cumorah described in the Book of Mormon, based largely on a letter written by Oliver Cowdery (Letter VII), published in the July 1835 &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; and reprinted several times at the direction of Joseph Smith. In the early 20th century, scholars from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) began to speculate that there were two such hills and that the final battle in the Book of Mormon took place on a hill in southern Mexico, Central America, or South America. The LDS Church has no official position on the matter, and while these hypotheses are not held by some leaders and members of the LDS Church, they are firmly espoused by others.

In the official account of Joseph Smith it is stated that Manchester, Ontario County, New York, is the location of the encounter with Angel Moroni.

==New York==

The hill named Cumorah in Manchester, New York is where Smith said he discovered the golden plates which contained the writings of the Book of Mormon. Smith wrote: &quot;On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box.&quot;

Smith visited the hill each year on September 22 between 1823 and 1827 and said he was instructed by a &quot;holy messenger&quot;, whom Smith identified as the Angel Moroni. Smith was finally allowed to take the record on September 22, 1827. Eleven other men gave written testimony that they had also seen the plates and held them in their hands.

The hill, which was unnamed prior to 1829, is situated a few miles from Smith&#x27;s boyhood home on a farm that was then owned by a local farmer, Alonzo Sanders. This farm was south of Palmyra, on the main road toward Canandaigua from Palmyra to Manchester, and is not far from Carangrie Creek and the Clyde River. According to geologists, the hill was formed during the retreat of the Ice Age glaciers, and it rises approximately above the surrounding valley floor.

Since 1829, the Latter Day Saints have called the hill &quot;Cumorah&quot;, and local non-Mormons have called it &quot;Mormon Hill&quot; or &quot;Gold Bible Hill&quot;. The hill has also been called &quot;Inspiration Point&quot;. The hill and surrounding land was purchased in the 1920s by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under the direction of church president Heber J. Grant. The transaction involved two separate purchases: the purchase of the &quot;Inglis farm&quot;; and the purchase of the &quot;Sexton farm&quot;. The Inglis farm consisted of on both sides of the Canandaigua–Palmyra road and encompassed one third of the western edge of the hill. The Sexton farm was purchased from the heirs of Pliny T. Sexton, who owned the &quot;Mormon Hill farm&quot; encompassing the remainder of the hill.

The Church has constructed a monument that is topped with a statue of the Angel Moroni on the top of the hill, and there is a visitor&#x27;s interpretative center at the base of the hill.

On June 8, 2022, several shots were fired into the Hill Cumorah visitors center. There were no injuries or fatalities, and investigators determined the shots were unintentional and came from target shooting on nearby farmland.

===Supposed location of the plates===

The stone box, described by Joseph Smith as the location where the plates were found, has not been located on the hill. In a letter, Oliver Cowdery gives the location as &quot;the west side of the hill, not far from the top&quot;. Shortly after Smith announced he had the plates, some local residents unsuccessfully searched the hill for a freshly dug hole that could have contained the plates. They did note a significantly sized hole on the east side of the hill that had been dug years previously by treasure seekers.

==Book of Mormon==

===Nephites===
In the Book of Mormon, Cumorah is mentioned in six verses, five in chapter 6 and one in chapter 8 of a subpart of the book, which is also known as the Book of Mormon. According to the record, Mormon is one of the final caretakers of the records of his people. He combined and abridged the records and engraved them on gold plates. His people, called the Nephites, were near to being destroyed by the Lamanites who had had many previous wars with the Nephites. Mormon wrote to the leader of the Lamanites to ask that he may gather his &quot;people unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give them battle.&quot; Cumorah is described as being in a land with &quot;many waters, rivers, and fountains&quot;.

The leader of the Lamanites agreed, and all of the Nephites gathered together, including their women and children. Mormon wrote, &quot;And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away [since the sign of the birth of Christ], we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the land of Cumorah.&quot; Mormon then hid all of the records of his people in the hill, except for the plates that he was currently writing on, which he gave to his son Moroni.

The Lamanites then attacked the Nephites, who were led by twenty-three men each with ten thousand men under their command. Mormon recorded that all but 24 of the Nephites had been killed, &quot;even all my people, save it were those twenty and four who were with me&quot;, except for those who fled to the south or defected to the Lamanites.

Mormon then records his mourning for his people and a last message to those who will read his record later, then again turns the unburied records over to his son Moroni. Moroni records, &quot;after the great and tremendous battle at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites who had escaped into the country southward were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all destroyed. And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my people.&quot;

===Jaredites===
This hill, known as &quot;Cumorah&quot; among the Nephites, was called &quot;Ramah&quot; () by the Jaredites:

In the Book of Mormon, during the time of the Book of Alma, the land of Cumorah was part of the land of Desolation, &quot;the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken&quot;. This land is identified as being north of the land of Zarahemla.

Moroni lived several years after recording the destruction of his people. He translated and abridged the plates which were the record of the Jaredites as the Book of Ether on to the plates that he was keeping. During this process, he wrote, &quot;Omer ... passed by the hill of Shim, and came over by the place where the Nephites were destroyed,&quot; and &quot;it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my father Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred.&quot; These passages identify the Nephite hill Cumorah as the same hill where the Jaredites had fought their final battle.

==Geography and historicity==
For over 100 years, Mormons generally accepted the New York setting for the Hill Cumorah. Since the early-20th century, there has been discussion within the Latter Day Saint movement about whether Hill Cumorah in New York is the same place described in the Book of Mormon, or whether there are two hills of the same name—one in New York and one in either Southern Mexico, Central America, or South America. Mormon archeologists overwhelmingly favor the &quot;two Cumorahs&quot; theory, while conservative theologians and some leaders prefer the view that only one Cumorah exists. Some non-Mormon scholars have provided alternative theories for the origin of the name Cumorah.

===New York hill===
At least ten different accounts refer to certain events that occurred at the hill Cumorah in New York. According to the account of Brigham Young, the angel instructed Joseph Smith to carry the golden plates back to the hill Cumorah. When Smith and Oliver Cowdery arrived, &quot;the hill opened, and they walked into a cave, in which there was a large and spacious room.&quot; The account continues by saying they found &quot;more plates than probably many wagon loads; they were piled up in the corners and along the walls.&quot; When they first entered, the Sword of Laban was hanging on the wall. When they re-entered later, the Sword of Laban was unsheathed and resting on top of the newly delivered golden plates. The sword had an inscription on it that said the sword &quot;will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ.&quot; It has been suggested by Mesoamerican Cumorah advocates that these events occurred in a vision rather than a physical visit.

There has been no on-site archaeological research at Cumorah in New York.

===Cerro El Vigia===
For a variety of reasons, some Mormon scholars have proposed the Cerro El Vigia (coordinates: or ) in Veracruz, Mexico, as the hill Cumorah in the Book of Mormon. John L. Sorenson has listed 15 cultural criteria for the hill Cumorah which are based on contextual clues from the text of the Book of Mormon: cities, towers, agriculture, metallurgy, formal political states, organized religion, idolatry, crafts, trade, writing, weaponry, astronomy, calendar systems, cement, and wheels. Sorensen alleges that the hill in New York at least partly fits four of these requirements while the Cerro El Vigia meets all of them.

According to David Palmer, a list of topographic and geographic criteria for Cumorah has been developed. These criteria are as follows:
#It was near an eastern seacoast ().
#It was near a narrow neck of land (, , , , , , , , , ).
#It was on a coastal plain, and possibly near other mountains and valleys ().
#It was one day&#x27;s journey south (east-south-east in modern coordinates) of a large body of water ().
#It was in an area of many rivers and waters ().
#It was in the presence of fountains ().
#The abundance of water apparently provided a military advantage ().
#There was an escape route to the land (&quot;country&quot;) southward ().
#The hill was large enough to provide a view of hundreds of thousands of bodies ().
#The hill was apparently a significant landmark (; ).
#The hill was apparently free standing so people could camp around it (, ).
#The climate was apparently temperate with no record of cold or snow (, )
#The hill was located in a volcanic zone susceptible to earthquakes ()

===Alternative origin of the name===

Grant H. Palmer suggested that Smith borrowed the name &quot;Cumorah&quot; through his study of the treasure-hunting stories of Captain William Kidd. Previous to announcing his discovery of the Book of Mormon, Smith had spent several years employed as a treasure seeker in Chenango County, New York. Kidd is considered to have started the treasure digging phenomenon after burying treasure on Gardiner&#x27;s Island in New York, which was later recovered by the colonial governor of New York. Capt. Kidd had buried this treasure after returning from an Indian Ocean voyage where he lost a third of his crew to cholera on the Comoros islands. Palmer suggested that Smith borrowed the name of a settlement in the Comoros—Moroni—and applied it to the angel who showed him where to find the golden plates buried in the Hill Cumorah.

FAIR, the Latter-day Saint apologetics organization, contends at length that the connection is tenuous.

===Alternate LDS archaeological view===

Mormon authors have suggested that the ancestors of the Nephite people may have encountered the Comoros islands on their initial voyage from the Arabian Peninsula to the western hemisphere, and that the Nephite civilization therefore may have retained a collective knowledge of the names &quot;Comoros&quot; and &quot;Moroni&quot;.

A minority of LDS scholars, some of whom specialize in 19th-century American literature, place the original literary setting for the Book of Mormon among the mythic mound builders of North America.

== Popular culture ==
===Literary interpretation===
Charles W. Dunn depicts Coriantumr&#x27;s last battle in his book &quot;The Master&#x27;s Other Sheep: An Epic of America and Other Poems&quot;. In an analysis of Dunn&#x27;s poem, professor of English Edward Whitley highlights the significance that the Hill Ramah is portrayed as being the same as the Hill Cumorah, where the Nephites are also destroyed. He explores the hill&#x27;s role in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s destruction of purported ancient American peoples, namely the Nephites and the Jaredites, and how that is portrayed in literature.

===Pageant===

The site near Palmyra, New York, formerly hosted the annual &quot;Hill Cumorah Pageant&quot;. This large, outdoor Latter-day Saint pageant typically occurred in early July and was free to the public. The pageant was sponsored by the LDS Church and traced its history back to 1935. The tradition of staging the play &quot;America&#x27;s Witness for Christ&quot; began in 1937. This was a play by H. Wayne Driggs that remained the basic text of the pageant until 1987. The 1987 revision, which was used through the final performance, was written in large part by Orson Scott Card. 
It was announced that 2020 would be the pageant&#x27;s last year as a result of new directives by the church to discourage large-scale pageants.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this final performance was initially rescheduled for mid-2021 and later canceled entirely, bringing the tradition to an end.

<doc id="481250" wikidata="Q747480" url="?curid=481250" title="Conflict of the Orders">
<text>The Conflict of the Orders or the Struggle of the Orders was a political struggle between the plebeians (commoners) and patricians (aristocrats) of the ancient Roman Republic lasting from 500 BC to 287 BC in which the plebeians sought political equality with the patricians. It played a major role in the development of the Constitution of the Roman Republic. Shortly after the founding of the Republic, this conflict led to a secession from Rome by the Plebeians to the Sacred Mount at a time of war. The result of this first secession was the creation of the office of plebeian tribune, and with it the first acquisition of real power by the plebeians.

At first, only patricians were allowed to stand for election to political office, but over time these laws were revoked, and eventually all offices were opened to the plebeians. Since most individuals who were elected to political office were given membership in the Roman Senate, this development helped to transform the Senate from a body of patricians into a body of both patrician and plebeian aristocrats. This development occurred at the same time that the plebeian legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, was acquiring additional power. At first, its acts (&quot;plebiscites&quot;) applied only to plebeians, although after 339 BC, with the institution of laws by the second plebeian dictator Q. Publilius Philo, these acts began to apply to both plebeians and patricians. The most fundamental change, however, was the granting of &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power) in which tribunes of the plebs could veto unfavorable legislation.

==The Era of Patricians (494–367 BC)==
The Conflict of the Orders began less than 20 years after the Republic was founded. Under the existing system, the poorer plebeians made up the bulk of the Roman army. During their military service, the farms on which their livelihood depended were left abandoned. Unable to earn a sufficient income, many turned to the patricians for aid, which left them open to abuse and even enslavement. As the patricians controlled Roman politics, the plebeians found no help from within the existing political system. Their solution was to go on strike. In 494 BC Rome was at war with three Italic tribes (the Aequi, Sabine and Volsci), but the plebeian soldiers, advised by Lucius Sicinius Vellutus, refused to march against the enemy and instead seceded to the Sacred Mount outside Rome. A settlement was negotiated and the patricians agreed that the plebs be given the right to meet in their own assembly, the Plebeian Council (&quot;Concilium Plebis&quot;), and to elect their own officials to protect their rights, the plebeian tribune (tribunus &quot;plebis&quot;).

During the 5th century BC, there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to reform Roman agrarian laws to distribute newly conquered territories amongst the plebs. In a number of instances, these reforms were advocated by the plebeian tribunes.

In 471 BC, the Lex Publilia was passed, marking an important reform shifting practical power from the patricians to the plebeians. The law transferred the election of the tribunes of the plebs to the Tribal Assembly (&quot;comitia populi tributa)&quot;, thereby freeing their election from the influence of the patrician clients.

During the early years of the republic, the plebeians were not allowed to hold magisterial office. While the plebeian tribunes regularly attempted to block legislation unfavorable to their order, the patricians frequently tried to thwart them by gaining the support of another tribune. One example of this occurred in 448 BC when only five tribunes were elected to fill ten positions; following tradition and pressured by the patricians, they co-opted five colleagues, two of whom were patricians. Concerns that the patricians would attempt to influence future elections in this manner, or by obtaining the office themselves to prevent the plebeian tribunes from exercising their powers, led to the passage of the &quot;Lex Trebonia&quot;, forbidding the plebeian tribunes from co-opting their colleagues in the future.

In 445 BC, the plebeians demanded the right to stand for election as consul (the chief-magistrate of the Roman Republic), but the Roman Senate refused to grant them this right. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, and while the consulship remained closed to the plebeians, consular command authority (imperium) was granted to a select number of military tribunes. These individuals, the so-called consular tribunes (&quot;military tribunes with consular powers&quot; or &quot;tribuni militum consulari potestate&quot;) were elected by the Centuriate Assembly, and the Senate had the power to veto any such election. This was the first of many attempts by the plebeians to achieve political equality with the Patricians.

Starting around the year 400 BC, a series of wars were fought against several neighboring tribes (in particular the Aequi, the Volsci, the Latins, and the Veii). The disenfranchised plebeians, who made up significant portion of the army, grew restless from bloodshed while the patrician aristocracy enjoyed the fruits of the resulting conquests. The plebeians, by now exhausted and bitter, demanded real concessions, so the tribunes Gaius Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius Lateranus passed a law in 367 BC (the Lex Licinia Sextia) which dealt with the economic plight of the plebeians. However, the law also required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year. The opening of the consulship to the plebeians was probably the cause behind the concession of 366 BC, in which the praetorship and curule aedile were both created, but opened only to patricians.

Shortly after the founding of the republic, the Centuriate Assembly became the principal Roman assembly in which magistrates were elected, laws were passed, and trials occurred. Also around this time, the plebeians assembled into an informal plebeian Curiae Assembly, which was the original Plebeian Council. Since they were organized on the basis of the Curia (and thus by clan), they remained dependent on their Patrician patrons. In 471 BC, a law was passed due to the efforts of the Tribune Volero Publilius, which allowed the plebeians to organize by tribe, rather than by curia. Thus, the Plebeian Curiae Assembly became the Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and the plebeians became politically independent.

During the regal period, the king nominated two equestrians to serve as his assistants, and after the overthrow of the monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero tells us that the Equators began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems as though this was the first instance of a joint Patricia-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the plebeians. While patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly, there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both plebeians and patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. Most contemporary accounts of an assembly of the Tribes refer specifically to the Plebeian Council.

The distinction between the joint Tribal Assembly (composed of both Patricians and Plebeians) and the Plebeian Council (composed only of Plebeians) is not well defined in the contemporary accounts, and because of this, the very existence of a joint Tribal Assembly can only be assumed through indirect evidence. During the 5th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the &quot;leges Valeria Horatio&quot; or the &quot;laws of the consuls Valerius and Horatius&quot;), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both plebeians and Patricians. This gave the plebeian tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanct of their person (&quot;intercessio&quot;) to veto acts of the Senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law over both plebeians and patricians, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the &quot;Shortening Law&quot;), which removed the last check that the patricians in the Senate had over this power.

==The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367–287 BC)==

In the decades following the passage of the Licinio-Sextian law of 367 BC, a series of laws were passed which ultimately granted plebeians political equality with patricians. The patrician era came to a complete end in 287 BC, with the passage of the Hortensian law. When the curule aedileship had been created, it had only been opened to Patricians. However, an agreement was ultimately secured between the plebeians and the patricians. One year, the curule aedileship was to be open to plebeians, and the next year, it was only to be open to patricians. Eventually, however, this agreement was abandoned and the plebeians won full admission to the curule aedileship. In addition, after the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebs acquired a &quot;de facto&quot; right to hold both the Roman dictatorship and the Roman censorship since only former consuls could hold either office. 356 BC saw the appointment of the first plebeian dictator, and in 339 BC the plebeians facilitated the passage of a law (the &quot;lex Publilia&quot;), which required the election of at least one plebeian censor for each five-year term. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor (Q. Publilius Philo) was elected. In addition, during these years, the plebeian Tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The Senate realized the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals, and so to win over the tribunes, senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power, and unsurprisingly, the tribunes began to feel obligated to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.

During the era of the kingdom, the Roman King appointed new senators through a process called &quot;lectio senatus&quot;, but after the overthrow of the kingdom, the consuls acquired this power. Around the middle of the 4th century BC, however, the Plebeian Assembly enacted the &quot;Ovinian Plebiscite&quot; (&quot;plebiscitum Ovinium&quot;), which gave the power to appoint new senators to the Roman censors. It also codified a commonplace practice, which all but required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate. While this was not an absolute requirement, the language in the law was so strict that the censors rarely disobeyed it. It is not known what year this law was passed, although it was probably passed between the opening of the censorship to plebeians (in 339 BC) and the first known &quot;lectio senatus&quot; by a censor (in 312 BC). By this point, plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices, and so the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. It was, in all likelihood, simply a matter of time before the plebeians came to dominate the Senate.

Under the new system, newly elected magistrates were awarded with automatic membership in the Senate, although it remained difficult for a plebeian from an unknown family to enter the Senate. On the rare occasion that an individual of an unknown family (&quot;ignobilis&quot;) was elected to high office, it was usually due to the unusual character of that individual, as was the case for both Gaius Marius and Marcus Tullius Cicero. Several factors made it difficult for individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. In addition, elections were expensive, neither senators nor magistrates were paid, and the Senate often did not reimburse magistrates for expenses associated with their official duties. Therefore, an individual usually had to be independently wealthy before seeking high office. Ultimately, a new patricio-plebeian aristocracy (&quot;nobilitas&quot;) emerged, which replaced the old patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing patrician nobility which ultimately forced the plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.

The Conflict of the Orders was finally coming to an end, since the plebeians had achieved political equality with the patricians. A small number of plebeian families had achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic Patrician families had always had, but these new plebeian aristocrats were as uninterested in the plight of the average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. During this time period, the plebeian plight had been mitigated due to the constant state of war that Rome was in. These wars provided employment, income, and glory for the average plebeian, and the sense of patriotism that resulted from these wars also eliminated any real threat of plebeian unrest. The &quot;lex Publilia&quot;, which had required the election of at least one plebeian censor every five years, contained another provision. Before this time, any bill passed by an assembly could only become a law after the patrician senators gave their approval. This approval came in the form of an &quot;auctoritas patrum&quot; (&quot;authority of the fathers&quot;). The &quot;lex Publilia&quot; modified this process, requiring the &quot;auctoritas patrum&quot; to be passed before a law could be voted on by one of the assemblies, rather than after the law had already been voted on. It is not known why, but this modification seems to have made the &quot;auctoritas patrum&quot; irrelevant.

By 287 BC, the economic condition of the average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness, and the plebeians quickly demanded relief. The senators, most of whom belonged to the creditor class, refused to abide by the demands of the plebeians, and the result was the final plebeian secession. The Plebeians seceded to the Janiculum Hill, and to end the secession, a dictator named Quintus Hortensius was appointed. Hortensius, a plebeian, passed the lex Hortensia which ended the requirement that an &quot;auctoritas patrum&quot; be passed before any bill could be considered by either the Plebeian Council or the Tribal Assembly. The requirement was not changed for the Centuriate Assembly. The Hortensian Law also reaffirmed the principle that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both plebeians and patricians, which it had originally acquired as early as 449 BC. The importance of the Hortensian law was in that it removed from the patrician senators their final check over the Plebeian Council.

==Historicity==

The traditional account was long accepted as factual, but it has a number of problems and inconsistencies, and almost every element of the story is controversial today. For instance, the &quot;fasti&quot; report a number of consuls with plebeian names during the 5th century BC, when the consulate was supposedly only open to patricians, and explanations to the effect that previously patrician &quot;gentes&quot; somehow became plebeians later are difficult to prove. Another point of difficulty is the apparent absence of armed revolt; as the history of the late Republic shows, similar types of grievances tended to lead to bloodshed rather quickly, yet Livy&#x27;s account seems to entail debate mostly, with the occasional threat of &quot;secessio&quot;. None of this is helped by our basic uncertainty as to who the &quot;plebs&quot; actually were; many of them are known to have been wealthy landowners, and the &quot;lower class&quot; label dates from the late Republic.

Some scholars, such as Richard E. Mitchell, have even argued that there was no conflict at all, the Romans of the late Republic having interpreted events of their distant past as if they were comparable to the class struggles of their own time. The crux of the problem is that there is no contemporaneous account of the conflict; writers such as Polybius, who might have met persons whose grandparents participated in the conflict, do not mention it (which may not be surprising, since Polybius&#x27; history covered a period after the conflict), while the writers who do speak of the conflict, such as Livy or Cicero, are sometimes thought to have reported fact and fable equally readily, and sometimes assume that there were no fundamental changes in Roman institutions in nearly 500 years.

<doc id="481258" wikidata="Q1790028" url="?curid=481258" title="Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532">
<text>The Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532 (24 Hen. 8. c. 12), also called the Statute in Restraint of Appeals, the Act of Appeals and the Act of Restraints in Appeals, was an Act of the Parliament of England.

It was passed in the first week of April 1533. It is considered by many historians to be the key legal foundation of the English Reformation.

The Act, drafted by Thomas Cromwell on behalf of King Henry VIII of England, forbade all appeals to the Pope in Rome on religious or other matters, making the King the final legal authority in all such matters in England, Wales, and other English possessions. This was achieved by claiming that England was an Empire and the English crown was an Imperial Crown – Henry&#x27;s historians claimed that they could trace the lineage back to Brutus and the fall of Troy.

This far-reaching measure made accepting papal authority, or following papal rulings in church, faith or other matters illegal. It was followed a year later by the Act of Supremacy 1534 which made Henry &quot;the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England called Anglicana Ecclesia, and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm&quot;. Those in his realms had to acknowledge this as they were by Acts of Parliament that automatically changed any previous constitutional arrangements. Not to do so was high treason, which would lead to trial and execution as happened to Thomas More. The Acts enabled Thomas Cranmer to finally grant King Henry his long-desired divorce from queen Catherine of Aragon, so that he could marry Anne Boleyn.

<text>SRI International (SRI) is a nonprofit scientific research institute and organization headquartered in Menlo Park, California, United States. It was established in 1946 by trustees of Stanford University to serve as a center of innovation to support economic development in the region.

The organization was founded as the Stanford Research Institute. SRI formally separated from Stanford University in 1970 and became known as SRI International in 1977. SRI performs client-sponsored research and development for government agencies, commercial businesses, and private foundations. It also licenses its technologies, forms strategic partnerships, sells products, and creates spin-off companies. SRI&#x27;s headquarters are located near the Stanford University campus.

SRI&#x27;s annual revenue in 2014 was approximately $540 million, which tripled from 1998 under the leadership of Curtis Carlson. In 1998, the organization was on the verge of bankruptcy when Carlson took over as CEO. Over the next sixteen years with Carlson as CEO, the organizational culture of SRI was transformed. SRI tripled in size, became very profitable, and created many world-changing innovations using the NABC framework. One of its successes was Siri, a personal assistant on iPhone, which was developed by a company SRI created and then sold to Apple. William A. Jeffrey served as SRI&#x27;s president and CEO from September 2014 to December 2021, and was succeeded as CEO by David Parekh.

SRI employs about 2,100 people. Sarnoff Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI since 1988, was fully integrated into SRI on January 3, 2011.

SRI&#x27;s focus areas include biomedical sciences, chemistry and materials, computing, Earth and space systems, economic development, education and learning, energy and environmental technology, security, national defense, sensing, and devices. SRI has received more than 4,000 patents and patent applications worldwide.

==History==
===Foundation===
In the 1920s, Stanford University professor Robert E. Swain proposed creating a research institute in the Western United States. Herbert Hoover, then a trustee of Stanford University, was also an early proponent of an institute but became less involved with the project after being elected president of the United States. The development of the institute was delayed by the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s, with three separate attempts leading to its formation in 1946.

In August 1945, Maurice Nelles, Morlan A. Visel, and Ernest L. Black of Lockheed made the first attempt to create the institute with the formation of the &quot;Pacific Research Foundation&quot; in Los Angeles. A second attempt was made by Henry T. Heald, then president of the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1945, Heald wrote a report recommending a research institute on the West Coast and a close association with Stanford University with an initial grant of $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ). A third attempt was made by Fred Terman, Stanford University&#x27;s dean of engineering. Terman&#x27;s proposal followed Heald&#x27;s but focused on faculty and student research more than contract research.

The trustees of Stanford University voted to create the organization in 1946. It was structured so that its goals were aligned with the charter of the university—to advance scientific knowledge and to benefit the public at large, not just the students of Stanford University. The trustees were named as the corporation&#x27;s general members, and elected SRI&#x27;s directors (later known as presidents); if the organization were dissolved, its assets would return to Stanford University.

Research chemist William F. Talbot became the institute&#x27;s first director. Stanford University president Donald Tresidder instructed Talbot to avoid work that would conflict with the interests of the university, particularly federal contracts that might attract political pressure. The drive to find work and the lack of support from Stanford faculty caused the new research institute to violate this directive six months later through the pursuit of a contract with the Office of Naval Research. This and other issues, including frustration with Tresidder&#x27;s micromanagement of the new organization, caused Talbot to repeatedly offer his resignation, which Tresidder eventually accepted. Talbot was replaced by Jesse Hobson, who had previously led the Armour Research Foundation, but the pursuit of contract work remained.

===Early history===

SRI&#x27;s first research project investigated whether the guayule plant could be used as a source of natural rubber. During World War II, rubber was imported into the U.S. and was subject to shortages and strict rationing. From 1942 to 1946, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supported a project to create a domestic source of natural rubber. Once the war ended, the United States Congress cut funding for the program; in response, the Office of Naval Research created a grant for the project to continue at SRI, and the USDA staff worked through SRI until Congress reauthorized funding in 1947.

SRI&#x27;s first economic study was for the United States Air Force. In 1947, the Air Force wanted to determine the expansion potential of the U.S. aircraft industry; SRI found that it would take too long to escalate production in an emergency. In 1948, SRI began research and consultation with Chevron Corporation to develop an artificial substitute for tallow and coconut oil in soap production; SRI&#x27;s investigation confirmed the potential of dodecylbenzene as a suitable replacement. Later, Procter &amp; Gamble used the substance as the basis for Tide laundry detergent.

The institute performed much of the early research on air pollution and the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere. SRI sponsored the First National Air Pollution Symposium in Pasadena, California, in November 1949. Experts gave presentations on pollution research, exchanged ideas and techniques, and stimulated interest in the field. The event was attended by 400 scientists, business executives, and civic leaders from the U.S. SRI co-sponsored subsequent events on the subject.
In April 1953, Walt and Roy Disney hired SRI (and in particular, Harrison Price) to consult on their proposal for establishing an amusement park in Burbank, California. SRI provided information on location, attendance patterns, and economic feasibility. SRI selected a larger site in Anaheim, prepared reports about the operation, provided on-site administrative support for Disneyland, and acted in an advisory role as the park expanded. In 1955, SRI was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation contracted with SRI to develop a near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual timing process during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design and development of the Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy&#x27;s development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard.

In the 1950s, SRI worked under the direction of the Bank of America to develop ERMA (Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting) and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). The ERMA project was led by computer scientist Jerre Noe, SRI&#x27;s assistant director of engineering at the time. As of 2011, MICR remains the industry standard in automated check processing. 
===Rapid expansion===
Douglas Engelbart, the founder of SRI&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center (ARC), was the primary force behind the design and development of the multi-user oN-Line System (or NLS), featuring original versions of modern computer-human interface elements including bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, and precursors to the graphical user interface such as the computer mouse. As a pioneer of human-computer interaction, Engelbart is arguably SRI&#x27;s most notable alumnus. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2000.

Bill English, then chief engineer at ARC, built the first prototype of a computer mouse from Engelbart&#x27;s design in 1964. SRI also developed inkjet printing (1961) and optical disc recording (1963). Liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology was developed at RCA Laboratories in the 1960s, which later became Sarnoff Corporation in 1988, a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI. Sarnoff was fully integrated into SRI in 2011.

In the early 1960s, Hewitt Crane and his colleagues developed the world&#x27;s first all-magnetic digital computer, based upon extensions to magnetic core memories. The technology was licensed to AMP Inc., who then used it to build specialized computers for controlling tracks in the New York City Subway and on railroad switching yards.

In 1966, SRI&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Center began working on &quot;Shakey the robot&quot;, the first mobile robot to reason about its actions. Equipped with a television camera, a triangulating rangefinder, and bump sensors, Shakey used software for perception, world-modeling, and acting. The project ended in 1972. SRI&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Center marked its 45th anniversary in 2011.
On October 29, 1969, the first connection on a wide area network to use packet switching, ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock&#x27;s laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s laboratory at SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites. The following year, Engelbart&#x27;s laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed. In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah were part of the original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was connected. In the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum microelectronics, and software-implemented fault tolerance.

The first true Internet transmission occurred on November 22, 1977, when SRI originated the first connection between three disparate networks. Data flowed seamlessly through the mobile Packet Radio Van between SRI in Menlo Park, California, and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles via University College London, England, across three types of networks: packet radio, satellite, and the ARPANET. In 2007, the Computer History Museum presented a 30th-anniversary celebration of this demonstration, which included several participants from the 1977 event. SRI would go on to run the Network Information Center under the leadership of Jake Feinler.
===Split and diversification===
The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was an important issue on college campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As a belated response to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made the university part of the military–industrial complex, the Stanford Research Institute split from Stanford University in 1970. The organization subsequently changed its name from the Stanford Research Institute to SRI International in 1977.
In 1972, physicists Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ undertook a series of investigations of psychic phenomena sponsored by the CIA, for which they coined the term remote viewing. Among other activities, the project encompassed the work of consulting &quot;consciousness researchers&quot; including artist/writer Ingo Swann, military intelligence officer Joseph McMoneagle, and psychic/illusionist Uri Geller. This ESP work continued with funding from the US intelligence community until Puthoff and Targ left SRI in the mid-1980s. For more information, see Parapsychology research at SRI.

Social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell created the Values, Attitudes and Lifestyles (VALS) psychographic methodology in the late 1970s to explain changing U.S. values and lifestyles. VALS was formally inaugurated as an SRI product in 1978 and was called &quot;one of the ten top market research breakthroughs of the 1980s&quot; by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine.

Throughout the 1980s, SRI developed Zylon, stealth technologies, improvements to ultrasound imaging, two-dimensional laser fluorescence imaging, and many-sorted logic. In computing and software, SRI developed a multimedia electronic mail system, a theory of non-interference in computer security, a multilevel secure (MLS) relational database system called Seaview, LaTeX, Open Agent Architecture (OAA), a network intrusion detection system, the Maude system, a declarative software language, and PacketHop, a peer-to-peer wireless technology to create scalable ad hoc networks. SRI&#x27;s research in network intrusion detection led to the patent infringement case &quot;SRI International, Inc. v. Internet Security Systems, Inc.&quot; The AI center&#x27;s robotics research led to Shakey&#x27;s successor, Flakey the robot, which focused on fuzzy logic.

In 1986, SRI.com became the 8th registered &quot;.com&quot; domain. The Artificial Intelligence Center developed the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. PRS launched the field of BDI-based intelligent agents. In the 1990s, SRI developed a letter sorting system for the United States Postal Service and several education and economic studies.

Military-related technologies developed by SRI in the 1990s and 2000s include ground- and foliage-penetrating radar, the INCON and REDDE command and control system for the U.S. military, and IGRS (integrated GPS radio system)—an advanced military personnel and vehicle tracking system. To train armored combat units during battle exercises, SRI developed the Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System (DFIRST), which uses GPS satellites, high-speed wireless communications, and digital terrain map displays.

SRI created the Centibots in 2003, one of the first and largest teams of coordinated, autonomous mobile robots that explore, map, and survey unknown environments. It also created BotHunter, a free utility for Unix, which detects botnet activity within a network.
With DARPA-funded research, SRI contributed to the development of speech recognition and translation products and was an active participant in DARPA&#x27;s Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) program. SRI developed DynaSpeak speech recognition technology, which was used in the handheld VoxTec Phraselator, allowing U.S. soldiers overseas to communicate with local citizens in near real-time. SRI also created translation software for use in the IraqComm, a device which allows two-way, speech-to-speech machine translation between English and colloquial Iraqi Arabic.

In medicine and chemistry, SRI developed dry-powder drugs, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), remote surgery (also known as telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, the experimental anticancer drugs Tirapazamine and TAS-108, ammonium dinitramide (an environmentally benign oxidizer for safe and cost-effective disposal of hazardous materials), the electroactive polymer (&quot;artificial muscle&quot;), new uses for diamagnetic levitation, and the antimalarial drug Halofantrine.

SRI performed a study in the 1990s for Whirlpool Corporation that led to modern self-cleaning ovens. In the 2000s, SRI worked on Pathway Tools software for use in bioinformatics and systems biology to accelerate drug discovery using artificial intelligence and symbolic computing techniques. The software system generates the BioCyc database collection, SRI&#x27;s growing collection of genomic databases used by biologists to visualize genes within a chromosome, complete biochemical pathways, and full metabolic maps of organisms.

===Early 21st century===
SRI researchers made the first observation of visible light emitted by oxygen atoms in the night-side airglow of Venus, offering new insight into the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. SRI education researchers conducted the first national evaluation of the growing U.S. charter schools movement. For the World Golf Foundation, SRI compiled the first-ever estimate of the overall scope of the U.S. golf industry&#x27;s goods and services ($62 billion in 2000), providing a framework for monitoring the long-term growth of the industry. In April 2000, SRI formed Atomic Tangerine, an independent consulting firm designed to bring new technologies and services to market.
In 2006, SRI was awarded a $56.9 million contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to provide preclinical services for the development of drugs and antibodies for anti-infective treatments for avian influenza, SARS, West Nile virus and hepatitis. Also in 2006, SRI selected St. Petersburg, Florida, as the site for a new marine technology research facility targeted at ocean science, the maritime industry and port security; the facility is a collaboration with the University of South Florida College of Marine Science and its Center for Ocean Technology. That facility created a new method for underwater mass spectrometry, which has been used to conduct &quot;advanced underwater chemical surveys in oil and gas exploration and production, ocean resource monitoring and protection, and water treatment and management&quot; and was licensed to Spyglass Technologies in March 2014.

In December 2007, SRI launched a spin-off company, Siri Inc., which Apple acquired in April 2010. In October 2011, Apple announced the Siri personal assistant as an integrated feature of the Apple iPhone 4S. Siri&#x27;s technology was born from SRI&#x27;s work on the DARPA-funded CALO project, described by SRI as the largest artificial intelligence project ever launched. Siri was co-founded in December 2007 by Dag Kittlaus (CEO), Adam Cheyer (vice president, engineering), and Tom Gruber (CTO/vice president, design), together with Norman Winarsky (vice president of SRI Ventures). Investors included Menlo Ventures and Morgenthaler Ventures.

For the National Science Foundation (NSF), SRI operates the advanced modular incoherent scatter radar (AMISR), a novel relocatable atmospheric research facility. Other SRI-operated research facilities for the NSF include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Sondrestrom Upper Atmospheric Research Facility in Greenland. In May 2011, SRI was awarded a $42 million contract to operate the Arecibo Observatory from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. The institute also manages the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Northern California, home of the Allen Telescope Array.

In February 2014, SRI announced a &quot;photonics-based testing technology called FASTcell&quot; for the detection and characterization of rare circulating tumor cells from blood samples. The test is aimed at cancer-specific biomarkers for breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, and leukemia cancers that circulate in the bloodstream in minute quantities, potentially diagnosing those conditions earlier.

In September 2018, the NSF announced that SRI International would be awarded $4.4 million to establish the backbone organization of a national network.

In April 2023, Xerox announced that it would donate PARC and its related assets to SRI. As part of the deal, Xerox would keep most of the patent rights inside PARC, and benefit from a preferred research agreement with SRI/PARC.

===Employees and financials===
As of February 2015, SRI employs approximately 2,100 people. In 2014, SRI had about $540 million in revenue. In 2013, the United States Department of Defense consisted of 63% of awards by value; the remainder was composed of the National Institutes of Health (11%); businesses and industry (8%); other United States agencies (6%); the National Science Foundation (6%); the United States Department of Education (4%); and foundations (2%).

As of February 2015, approximately 4,000 patents have been granted to SRI International and its employees.

===Facilities===
SRI is primarily based on a campus located in Menlo Park, California, which is considered part of Silicon Valley. This campus encompasses of office and lab space. In addition, SRI has a campus in Princeton, New Jersey, with of research space. There are also offices in Washington, D.C., and Tokyo, Japan. In total, SRI has of office and laboratory space.

===Organization===
SRI International is organized into seven units (generally called divisions) focusing on specific subject areas.


==Staff members and alumni==


SRI has had a chief executive of some form since its establishment. Before the split with Stanford University, the position was known as the director; after the split, it is known as the company&#x27;s president and CEO. SRI has had nine so far, including William F. Talbot (1946–1947), Jesse E. Hobson (1947–1955), E. Finley Carter (1956–1963), Charles Anderson (1968–1979), William F. Miller (1979–1990), James J. Tietjen (1990–1993), William P. Sommers (1993–1998) Curtis Carlson (1998–2014). More recently, the role was split into two. The current CEO is David Parekh and the president is Manish Kothari (formerly president of SRI Ventures).

SRI also has had a board of directors since its inception, which has both guided and provided opportunities for the organization. The current board of directors includes Samuel Armacost (Chairman of the Board Emeritus), Mariann Byerwalter (chairman), William A. Jeffrey, Charles A. Holloway (vice-chairman), Vern Clark, Robert L. Joss, Leslie F. Kenne, Henry Kressel, David Liddle, Philip J. Quigley, Wendell Wierenga and John J. Young Jr.

Its notable researchers include Elmer Robinson (meteorologist), co-author of the 1968 SRI report to the American Petroleum Institute (API) on the risks of fossil fuel burning to the global climate. Many notable researchers were involved with the Augmentation Research Center. These include Douglas Engelbart, the developer of the modern GUI; William English, the inventor of the mouse; Jeff Rulifson, the primary developer of the NLS; Elizabeth J. Feinler, who ran the Network Information Center; and David Maynard, who would help found Electronic Arts.

The Artificial Intelligence Center has also produced a large number of notable alumni, many of whom contributed to Shakey the robot; these include project manager Charles Rosen, as well as Nils Nilsson, Bertram Raphael, Richard O. Duda, Peter E. Hart, Richard Fikes, and Richard Waldinger. AI researcher Gary Hendrix went on to found Symantec. Former Yahoo! President and CEO Marissa Mayer performed a research internship at the Center in the 1990s. The CALO project (and its spin-off, Siri) also produced notable names including C. Raymond Perrault and Adam Cheyer.

Several SRI projects produced notable researchers and engineers long before computing was mainstream. Early employee Paul M. Cook founded Raychem. William K. MacCurdy developed the Hydra-Cushion freight car for Southern Pacific in 1954; Hewitt Crane and Jerre Noe were instrumental in the development of Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting; Harrison Price helped The Walt Disney Company design Disneyland; James C. Bliss developed the Optacon; and Robert Weitbrecht invented the first telecommunications device for the deaf.

==Spin-off companies==

Working with investment and venture capital firms, SRI and its former employees have launched more than 60 spin-off ventures in a wide range of fields, including Siri (acquired by Apple), Tempo AI (acquired by Salesforce.com), Redwood Robotics (acquired by Google), Desti (acquired by HERE), Grabit, Kasisto, Passio, Artificial Muscle, Inc. (acquired by Bayer MaterialScience), Nuance Communications, Intuitive Surgical, Ravenswood Solutions, and Orchid Cellmark.

Some former SRI staff members have also established new companies. In engineering and analysis, for example, notable companies formed by SRI alums include Weitbrecht Communications, Exponent and Raychem. Companies in the area of legal, policy and business analysis include Fair Isaac Corporation, Global Business Network and Institute for the Future.

Research in computing and computer science-related areas led to the development of many companies, including Symantec, the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute, E-Trade, and Verbatim Corporation. Wireless technologies spawned Firetide and venture capital firm enVia Partners. Health systems research inspired Telesensory Systems.

<text>Raul Jumkovich Khajimba (, ; born 21 March 1959) is an Abkhazian politician who served as President of Abkhazia from 25 September 2014 until 12 January 2020. He was also Chairman of the Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia from 2010 to 2015. Khajimba previously held the offices of Vice President (2005–2009), Prime Minister (2003–2004) and Defence Minister (2002–2003). He unsuccessfully ran for president in 2004, 2009 and 2011. He resigned the presidency in 2020 due to protests against him.

==Early life and career==
Raul Khajimba was born on 21 March 1959 in Tkvarcheli, where he went to school and worked as a mechanic at the power station. From 1976 until 1978, he served in the Soviet Air Defence Forces. From 1979 until 1984, he graduated from the Law Faculty of the Abkhazian State University. From 1985 until 1986 Khajimba studied at the KGB school in Minsk, and he subsequently served as a KGB agent in Tkvarcheli until 1992.

During the 1992–1993 war with Georgia, Khajimba was the head of the military intelligence and counterintelligence operation on the eastern front. For his work, he was awarded the Order of Leon.

From 1996 until 1998, Khajimba headed the anti-smuggling division of the State Customs Committee. In 1998, he became its deputy chairman.

==In government (1999–2004)==

===Security Service chairman, First Vice Premier and Minister of Defence (1999–2003)===
After a bomb attack on 13 December 1999 in Sukhumi targeting government officials, President Ardzinba dismissed Astamur Tarba as Security Service chairman and appointed Khajimba in his stead. On 18 June 2001, he additionally became First Vice Premier. On 1 November he was succeeded as Head of the State Security Service by Interior Minister Zurab Agumava. On 16 May 2002, Khajimba was appointed Defence Minister, replacing Vladimir Mikanba, while remaining First Vice Premier.

===Prime Minister (2003–2004)===
In the evening of 7 April 2003, Prime Minister Gennadi Gagulia filed for resignation. Early in the morning of that day, nine prisoners had escaped, four of which had been sentenced to death due to their involvement in the 2001 Kodori crisis. President Ardzinba initially refused to accept Gagulia&#x27;s resignation, but was forced to agree on 8 April. Vice President Valery Arshba denied on 8 April that the government&#x27;s resignation was due to the prison escape, and stated that instead it was caused by the opposition&#x27;s plans to hold protest rallies on 10 April. On 22 April 2003, Raul Khajimba was appointed the new Prime Minister. He remained Prime Minister until October 2004.

As then-President Vladislav Ardzinba was seriously ill and did not appear in public during his term, Khajimba acted as a de facto head of state in his absence. In this role, he met a number of political leaders, including Igor Ivanov, foreign minister of Russia. He has been a sharp opponent of reunification with Georgia, and vehemently condemned Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili&#x27;s proposal for a two-state federation in May 2004.

==2004 and 2005 presidential elections==
Khadjimba was tipped as the favourite to win the October 2004 presidential elections, and was strongly endorsed by both outgoing president Ardzinba and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both men campaigned on his behalf and dedicated significant resources to assisting the Khadjimba campaign. However, opposition candidate Sergei Bagapsh polled more votes on election day, in what was widely attributed as a backlash against the strong Russian influence in his campaign.

After the election, both Bagapsh and Khadjimba claimed victory, with Khadjimba alleging that electoral fraud in the pro-Bagapsh Gali region had been responsible for Bagapsh&#x27;s win. Ardzinba soon dismissed Khadjimba as Prime Minister, replacing him with a compromise candidate, Nodar Khashba, and two months of drawn-out disputes followed, involving public protests, court action and parliamentary proceedings.

In December 2004, Khadjimba and Bagapsh came to an agreement which would see the pair run as part of a national unity ticket in repeat elections, with Khadjimba running as Bagapsh&#x27;s vice-president. As part of this deal, the position of vice-president was given expanded powers covering defence and foreign affairs. The joint ticket easily won the January 2005 election, winning more than 90% of the vote.

==Vice President (2005–2009)==
However, in the aftermath of the election win, many analysts have suggested that Khadjimba&#x27;s executive authority would be somewhat limited under the new arrangement, with Bagapsh and his Prime Minister, Alexander Ankvab, likely to maintain ultimate control over the areas of policy nominally assigned to the vice-president.

The controversy resurfaced again in June 2008, when Khadjimba attended a congress of the Aruaa veteran organisation, of which he is a member. The congress issued a statement criticizing the Bagapsh administration&#x27;s &quot;multi-vector foreign policy&quot;, referring to the talks with Georgian and Western diplomats, and called for greater ties with Russia. The pro-Bagapsh politicians from the Amtsakhara veteran organisation described Khadjimba&#x27;s criticism of the government, in which he was a vice-president, &quot;immoral&quot;. Later that month, Khadjimba reiterated his stance towards Bagapsh&#x27;s foreign policy, stating that Abkhazia&#x27;s only protector could be Russia and using force would be inevitable for gaining control of the upper Kodori Valley in northeastern Abkhazia, the only part of Abkhazia under Georgian control at the time. In August 2008, the Abkhazian military did take the upper Kodory Valley by force during the August 2008 war over South Ossetia.

On 18 May 2009 the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia and Aruaa issued a press statement and on 20 May they gave a press conference with several other opposition parties, on both occasions voicing severe criticism over the achievements of the government and recent foreign policy decisions. On 28 May Khajimba resigned, saying that he agreed with the criticism, but attributing his failure to tackle corruption and improve security to lack of room for manoeuvre and no support from the president Bagapsh whom he also accused of violating the 2004 powersharing agreement and criticized him for signing a border protection agreement with Russia in 2009.

==Opposition leader (2009–2014)==

===2009 presidential election===
The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that during the summer of 2009 Khajimba had entered negotiations with Beslan Butba over forming an alliance for in the presidential election, but the pair fell out following the visit of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to Abkhazia. Putin had met with Khajimba, but not with Butba, and Butba considered this an unfriendly act on the part of Khajimba. During the nomination period for candidates, Khajimba then tried to form a team with Ardzinba. The alliance would have combined Ardzinba&#x27;s backing by part of the business community and his financial resources with Khajimba&#x27;s electoral popularity. The pair said they would run together during two meetings with voters, and the idea was that they would receive the joint nomination by the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia. According to the Kommersant, in the end the pair could not agree on what positions they would get. Khajimba wanted the presidency, and offered Ardzinba to become Prime Minister, but this was not acceptable to the latter. The congress of the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia planned on 29 October was called off, and Ardzinba was instead nominated by an initiative group that day.

Khajimba had already been officially nominated for the presidency by an interest group on 19 October, and received the additional support on 20 October of the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia, Aruaa and Akhatsa. Khajimba picked Vasilii Avidzba as his vice presidential candidate.

Nevertheless, on 18 November Khajimba and Ardzinba announced that they would continue to coordinate their campaigns, and that they had appointed chairman of Aruaa, Vadim Smyr to lead this coordination. On 20 November, Khajimba stated that he and Ardzinba had different visions on coming to power, but that he did not consider Ardzinba his opponent, and that in the case of a second round, he, Ardzinba and Butba would support each other.

A second round proved to be unnecessary, since incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh won a 61.16% first round victory. Khajimba came in second place with 15,584 votes, 15.32% of the total number cast.

===Chairman of the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia===
On 12 May 2010, Raul Khajimba was elected Chairman of the FNUA, after the party congress had reduced the number of chairmen from 2 to 1.

===2011 presidential election===
Khajimba again ran for president in 2011, after the death of President Sergei Bagapsh. His running mate was Svetlana Jergenia, widow of first President Vladislav Ardzinba. The pair was first nominated by an initiative group on 28 June and then by the Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia on 16 July. They received the additional support of Akhatsa (5 July), Aruaa (7 July), former Prime Minister and 2004 presidential candidate Anri Jergenia (27 July) and the Union of the Cossacks of Abkhazia (5 August).

The pair scored a 19.82% third place, losing to Acting President Alexander Ankvab.

===May 2014 revolution===

Khajimba led opposition protests that forced Alexander Ankvab to resign as president on 1 June 2014. Khajimba won the subsequent presidential election with a slim 50.60% first-round victory.

==President (2014–2020)==

Khajimba was inaugurated as president on 25 September 2014. Two months into his presidency, he signed a treaty with Russian president Vladimir Putin deepening ties between Abkhazia and Russia. Provisions of the agreement included placing the Abkhazian military under the direct control of Russia&#x27;s armed forces and committing Abkhazia toward bringing its trade laws into alignment with the Eurasian Economic Union. The treaty was widely condemned in the West and by the Republic of Georgia, with US newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggesting the Abkhazian government had no choice but to agree to Putin&#x27;s terms. However, Khajimba hailed closer ties with Russia as promoting &quot;the full scope of guarantees for the safety of our state and extensive opportunities for the social and economic development&quot;.

Raul Khajimba as the Leader of Abkhazia got awarded with Order of Leon (as Vice President in 2005), Order of Merit, II degree (Transnistria in 2006 as vice president), Order of Merit, I Degree (Transnistria in 2015 as president), Order of Friendship (Republic of South Ossetia in 2015 as president), Order of Friendship (Transnistria in 2016 as president), and Umayyad Order (Syrian Arab Republic in 2018 as president).

Raul Khajimba was reelected in September 2019 after winning 26.33% of votes in the first round and 48.68% in the second. 
In January 2020 protests broke out against Khajimba. On 10 January the Supreme Court of Abkhazia declared Khajimba&#x27;s victory in the 2019 presidential election nullified, and called for new elections on 22 March. On 12 January Khajimba resigned the presidency.

<text>SAIL, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language, was developed by Dan Swinehart and Bob Sproull of the Stanford AI Lab. It was originally a large ALGOL 60-like language for the PDP-10 and DECSYSTEM-20. The language combined the earlier PDP-6/-10 language GOGOL compiler, essentially an integer-only version of ALGOL, with the associative store from the LEAP language. The first release was in November 1969 and it saw continued development into the 1980s, including a commercial derivative, MAINSAIL.

SAIL&#x27;s main feature is a symbolic data system based upon an associative store based on LEAP by Jerry Feldman and Paul Rovner. Items may be stored as unordered sets or as associations (triples). Other features include processes, procedure variables, events and interrupts, contexts, backtracking and record garbage collection. It also has block-structured macros, a coroutining facility and some new data types intended for building search trees and association lists.

==History==
The GOGOL compiler was originally written by Bill McKeeman on the PDP-1. It was essentially an integer-only version of ALGOL-60 with a number of additions to provide direct access to the memory and other hardware to allow it to be used as a systems programming language. It reduced arrays to a single dimension, removed any ability to perform dynamic memory allocations, but did add some additional string functionality. A greatly updated version by John Sauter, GOGOL II, was written as part of a port of the underlying operating system from ODIN to THOR. When the Stanford AI Lab received their PDP-6, Sauter, Pettit and (mostly) Dan Swinehart wrote GOGOL III for the new machine.

Swinehart, joined by Robert Sproull, merged the GOGOL syntax with additions from the contemporary versions of the LEAP language to produce the first version of SAIL in November 1969. The main feature of LEAP as a language was its use of associative storage, more commonly known today as a Map or Dictionary. In LEAP, one could set the value of a field in a type using a triple, with the first entry being the variable name, the second being the field name, and the third the value.

Further improvements were added by Russell Taylor, Jim Low and Hana Samet, who added processes, procedure variables, interrupts, context, matching procedures, a new macro system, and other features. Development then passed to Taylor, John Reiser and Robert Smith, who added a debugger, a system-level print statement, records, and performed the conversion from Standord&#x27;s own SUAI to TENEX. It was later ported to DEC&#x27;s TOPS-10 as well, while the original TENEX version worked without modification under TOPS-20.

==Description==
===Basic structure and statements===
Like many ALGOL systems, and the later Pascal, the basic structure of SAIL is based on the &quot;block&quot;, which is denoted by the code between the keywords and . Within a block there is further structure, with the &quot;declarations&quot; of local variables at the top, if any, and the code, or &quot;statements&quot;, following. In contrast to most dialects, SAIL allowed one to place a string after the , like , and then end the block with . The compiler would use these, if entered, to check for proper bracketing. SAIL did not include the equivalent of a block as in Pascal, nor a as in C, execution started with the first line of code in the outermost block.

Standard statements included , , for top-tested loops, for bottom-tested, and which used a label. The was similar to in C, but normally used a somewhat different syntax, like , which returns the appropriate string based on the value of i. If one wanted to test explicit values in the CASE, the values had to be in square brackets:
CASE I OF
 BEGIN
 [0] 10;
 [4] 25;
 [6][7] 50
 END;
This code will ignore values like 1 to 3, and only return a value for the listed values. Note that the last item cannot have a semicolon following.

 exited from a block, typically used in loops, and returned to the top of the block. An infinite loop was typically implemented with .

===Procedure declarations===
Procedures were implemented in a fashion similar to the C programming language, with the return type, if any, in front of the name, for instance, . Note the uncommon use of the semicolon here, whereas Pascal would immediately follow with a block, typically a .

In order to improve performance, SAIL added two procedure qualifiers, and . told the compiler that the procedure might call itself, and thus its local variables had to be written to the stack, not just the subroutine return information. did the opposite, demanding the procedure have no local variables at all, not allowing out of the function, and could not refer to enclosing procedure&#x27;s variables. These directives could avoid the requirement of filling out a complete activation record, thereby improving performance. This also had the side-effect of meaning that variables declared within a procedure that was not marked would not be reset between calls, acting similar to C&#x27;s .

SAIL also included the qualifier, used to insert forward declarations, typically when two procedures call each other. worked as in C, exiting the procedure and returning to the caller, as well as optionally returning a value if the procedure uses one. Parameters passed to the procedures could be by or , the later allowing values to be passed back.

===Basic data types and operators===
The basic variable types in SAIL are integers, reals (floating point), booleans, and strings. Type conversions were automatic, so would convert the value 5 to a double as that is what SQRT requires, and then cast the result to an integer. Any of these types can be turned into an array by adding the qualifier and placing the array bounds in brackets, for instance, . SAIL supported 1-d and 2-d arrays.

The language used the left-arrow for assignment, , or the underscore on platforms that did not have Stanford ASCII. It included a number of standard functions like square root, all of the common math operators, and was otherwise similar to most ALGOL derivatives for normal programming.

Strings were manipulated using array slicing, with returning the substring with characters from i to j, or which returned the substring starting at i and running for j characters. The (inity) keyword represented the end of the string, so one could to return everything from i on. String functions and operators included for testing if two strings were equal, the ampersand for concatenation, , and which removes the first character from the string. There was no way to compare strings other than , operators like were defined only for numbers.

===Records and pointers===
The concept of records as a data type had only recently been introduced when SAIL was being written. This feature thus shows the signs of being &quot;bolted on&quot; to the language syntax. For instance a record structure was defined using the statement: . This statement worked in a fashion similar to the statement in Pascal, defining the template for the record. To create a record, one used the statement, which returned a . Pointers were typed, and could be typed to more than one type, for instance, defines rp, a pointer to either a person or university record. Pointers could also be declared to point to . Accessing the data in a record was similarly idiosyncratic; to print the name file of a person, for instance, the syntax was .

===String scanner===
In addition to basic string functionality, SAIL included a string scanner system as part of the basic language. worked on string variables, while the otherwise similar was used to scan strings being read from a file. Both used a system known as a &quot;break table&quot; which consisted of a set of characters that represented places to stop reading, examples include linefeeds, various whitespace, and punctuation. These tables were stored in special structures, and the system allowed only 54 of these, a number that is not explained in the documentation.

To build a new table, one first called which returned the next free slot in the table, or &quot;table number&quot;. This would be followed by a , which took the table number, a string with the break characters, another string of &quot;omit characters&quot; which were simply ignored during reading (as if they were not in the string) and finally the &quot;modes&quot;, flags that indicated how the system should work. Once set, the program could then repeatedly call or and be returned complete strings. This included a reference parameter, normally brkchar, that contained the character that caused the break, allowing one to test, for instance, for end-of-file characters. The system is conceptually similar to C&#x27;s functionality, which is part of stdlib as opposed to being part of the language itself as in SAIL.

===Input/Output===
SAIL&#x27;s input/output system was based on the idea of numbered &quot;channels&quot; in a fashion somewhat similar to the scanner entries. To open a file, one first called to return a value of a free channel, and then ed it with various parameters to describe the file and modes of operation. was equivalent to close. Once opened, the file could be read, subject to the scanning rules noted above, by calling and looking for the end-of-file. Files did not have names as part of the OPEN, instead, could be used to point a channel at a given file, made a new file associated with a channel, and allowed an existing file name to be changed. One can open an existing file for writing using .

There were numerous special handlers and variables that were used during I/O. For instance, the function was an INPUT hard-wired to the user terminal and always open, and it returns its break character in the system variable . The function normally output to the same terminal channel, but could also be directed at any other opened channel.

===Compiler directives===
As a systems programming language, performance was important and to help with this, SAIL included a which used string-replacement in a fashion similar to C&#x27;s macros. A difference was that the delimiters around the substitution had to be defined, for instance . One common use of these macros was to define character constants like , as these were not part of the basic language. Another was to redefine the statement to the shorter .

The system also included a conditional compilation system using statements, as opposed to pre-processor directives as found in C. would compile the blocks between the corresponding and or . The condition in the IFCR must be known at compile time, so, like C, was normally a d value.

===LEAP data===
The main difference between SAIL and other ALGOL-derived languages was its inclusion of the associative store from the LEAP language. This system provided a system that allowed data to be placed in record-like structures and then saved, retrieved and searched. In this respect it was similar to the data handling features in COBOL. The basis for the store was the &quot;association&quot; or &quot;triple&quot;, which allowed a data value to be associated with a named slot in a record. For instance, one might make a record of the type with &quot;Tom&quot; and set the field to &quot;Harry&quot;. This results in a triple of the form (Father, Tom, Harry). The associated libraries could then find all the s with &quot;Harry&quot; as the , perhaps returning &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot;.

==Example==
The following code, found in the Tutorial, converts an input string to upper case.
STRING PROCEDURE upper(STRING rawstring);
 BEGIN &quot;upper&quot;
 STRING tmp;
 INTEGER char;
 tmp←NULL;
 WHILE LENGTH(rawstring) DO
 BEGIN
 char←LOP(rawstring); COMMENT LOP returns the first character and moves the pointer past it
 tmp←tmp&amp;(IF &quot;a&quot; LEQ char LEQ &quot;z&quot; THEN char-&#x27;40 ELSE char);
 END;
 RETURN(tmp);
 END &quot;upper&quot;;
==Uses==
A number of interesting software systems were coded in SAIL, including some early versions of FTP and TeX, a document formatting system called PUB, and BRIGHT, a clinical database project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.

In 1978, there were half a dozen different operating systems for the PDP-10: ITS (MIT), WAITS (Stanford), TOPS-10 (DEC), CMU TOPS-10 (Carnegie Mellon), TENEX (BBN), Tymcom-X (Tymshare), and TOPS-20 (DEC, based on TENEX).

SAIL was ported from WAITS to ITS so that MIT researchers could make use of software developed at Stanford University. Every port usually required the rewriting of I/O code in each application.

A machine-independent version of SAIL called MAINSAIL was developed in the late 1970s and was used to develop many eCAD design tools during the 1980s. MAINSAIL was easily portable to new processors and operating systems, and was still in limited use .

<doc id="481276" wikidata="Q4679626" url="?curid=481276" title="Adam Powell (game designer)">
<text>Adam James Powell (born 20 December 1976) is a Welsh computer programmer, game designer and businessman. He is the co-founder of Neopets and Meteor Games.

==Career==
Powell attended the University of Nottingham from 1995 to 1998 studying for a computer science degree. While at Nottingham, Powell (known as &quot;Jander&quot; at the time) and a user known as &quot;Myurr&quot; coded a DikuMUD-based MUD titled &quot;Dark Heart&quot;.

Before Neopets, Powell founded various companies. In 1997 he started Shout! Advertising, which went on to be acquired by ValueClick, Inc. in 2000. In 1999 he founded Netmagic and Powlex, which were online companies for online banner advertising and web page design, respectively. 

===Neopets===
Powell first had the idea of Neopets in 1997, while studying at the University of Nottingham. He and Donna Powell (formerly Donna Williams) started programming the site in September 1999, and launched the site two months later on 15 November 1999. Powell programmed the entire site, and created most of the original activities and games.

In April 2000, Powell negotiated a significant investment in Neopets.com and transferred the company from the UK to Los Angeles, US. After the relocation, Powell remained on staff as creative director and technical lead. Under Powell&#x27;s management, Neopets went from its initial launch to over 140 million accounts and 5 billion pageviews per month. On 20 June 2005, Viacom bought Neopets, Inc. for US$160 million.

Powell continued to work for Neopets.com until June 2007, aiding the transition following the purchase and continuing to develop high-end concepts for the site.

Powell has creative design and writing credits on a wide variety of Neopets products including SCEA&#x27;s 2006 PlayStation Portable release &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wizards of the Coast&quot; September 2003 release the &quot;Neopets Trading Card Game&quot; and Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc&#x27;s 2005 release &quot;&quot;, for the PlayStation 2.

===Meteor Games===
In 2007, Adam and Donna Powell founded Meteor Games, an independent online gaming studio committed to developing immersive and innovative games spanning the web, social networks, and mobile devices. Meteor Games was headquartered in Los Angeles, and had 100 employees by 2010, including a former Neopets developer &quot;TPOSG&quot; (&quot;The Phantom Orange Shirt Guy&quot;). 

Meteor Games&#x27; first project was &quot;Twin Skies&quot;, a 3D MMO that blended casual gaming and social networking elements with traditional massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Meteor Games released their first web-based game &quot;Vikings, Pirates and Ninjas&quot; in March 2009. The game was free to play on the web and Facebook.

In the company&#x27;s shift to the rapidly growing social gaming market it released several games and apps primarily for Facebook, including &quot;Island Paradise&quot;, &quot;Serf Wars&quot;, and &quot;Ranch Town&quot;. As of an interview with the CEO in February 2011, Meteor Games hadn&#x27;t raised any venture capital but &quot;was profitable&quot;.

Late in December 2011, Meteor Games laid off 90% of its staff, shut down the Viacom-backed game &quot;Treasure Keepers&quot;, and subsequently wound down all operations.

===&quot;Moglings&quot;===
Around June 2013, Adam stated that he, Donna, and TPOSG would be making a new game. In May 2014 Donna hosted an AMA on the Neopets subreddit, in which she revealed that the project&#x27;s working title was &quot;Moglings&quot;. On September 22, 2014, Adam stated in a post to the &quot;Moglings&quot; subreddit that the project would be suspended for some time, perhaps to be taken up again in early 2016.

<text>A conventional idea of a sustainable fishery is that it is one that is harvested at a sustainable rate, where the fish population does not decline over time because of fishing practices. Sustainability in fisheries combines theoretical disciplines, such as the population dynamics of fisheries, with practical strategies, such as avoiding overfishing through techniques such as individual fishing quotas, curtailing destructive and illegal fishing practices by lobbying for appropriate law and policy, setting up protected areas, restoring collapsed fisheries, incorporating all externalities involved in harvesting marine ecosystems into fishery economics, educating stakeholders and the wider public, and developing independent certification programs.

Some primary concerns around sustainability are that heavy fishing pressures, such as overexploitation and growth or recruitment overfishing, will result in the loss of significant potential yield; that stock structure will erode to the point where it loses diversity and resilience to environmental fluctuations; that ecosystems and their economic infrastructures will cycle between collapse and recovery; with each cycle less productive than its predecessor; and that changes will occur in the trophic balance (fishing down marine food webs).

==Overview==

Global wild fisheries are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitats, such as estuaries and coral reefs, in critical condition. Current aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, such as salmon, does not solve the problem because farmed piscivores are fed products from wild fish, such as forage fish. Salmon farming also has major negative impacts on wild salmon. Fish that occupy the higher trophic levels are less efficient sources of food energy.

A report at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2021 stated that: &quot;Sustainable fisheries accounted for approximately 0.1 per cent of global GDP in 2017&quot;.

==Defining sustainability==
Three ways of defining a sustainable fishery exist:
* &quot;Long term constant yield&quot; is the idea that undisturbed nature establishes a steady state that changes little over time. Properly done, fishing at up to maximum sustainable yield allows nature to adjust to a new steady state, without compromising future harvests. However, this view is naive, because constancy is not an attribute of marine ecosystems, which dooms this approach. Stock abundance fluctuates naturally, changing the potential yield over short and long-term periods.
* &quot;Preserving intergenerational equity&quot; acknowledges natural fluctuations and regards as unsustainable only practices which damage the genetic structure, destroy habitat, or deplete stock levels to the point where rebuilding requires more than a single generation. Providing rebuilding takes only one generation, overfishing may be economically foolish, but it is not unsustainable. This definition is widely accepted.
* &quot;Maintaining a biological, social and economic system&quot; considers the health of the human ecosystem as well as the marine ecosystem. A fishery which rotates among multiple species can deplete individual stocks and still be sustainable so long as the ecosystem retains its intrinsic integrity. Such a definition might consider as sustainable fishing practices that lead to the reduction and possible extinction of some species.

===Social sustainability===
Fisheries and aquaculture are, directly or indirectly, a source of livelihood for over 500 million people, mostly in developing countries.

Social sustainability can conflict with biodiversity. A fishery is socially sustainable if the fishery ecosystem maintains the ability to deliver products the society can use. Major species shifts within the ecosystem could be acceptable as long as the flow of such products continues. Humans have been operating such regimes for thousands of years, transforming many ecosystems, depleting or driving to extinction many species.

According to Hilborn, the &quot;loss of some species, and indeed transformation of the ecosystem is not incompatible with sustainable harvests.&quot; For example, in recent years, barndoor skates have been caught as bycatch in the western Atlantic. Their numbers have severely declined and they will probably go extinct if these catch rates continue. Even if the barndoor skate goes extinct, changing the ecosystem, there could still be sustainable fishing of other commercial species.

=== Environmental sustainability ===
The focus of sustainable fishing is often on the fish. Other factors are sometimes included in the broader question of sustainability. The use of non-renewable resources is not fully sustainable. This might include diesel fuel for the fishing ships and boats: there is even a debate about the long term sustainability of biofuels. Modern fishing nets are usually made of artificial polyamides like nylon. Synthetic braided ropes are generally made from nylon, polyester, polypropylene or high performance fibers such as ultra high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) and aramid.

Energy and resources are employed in fish processing, refrigeration, packaging, logistics, etc. The methodologies of life-cycle assessment are useful to evaluate the sustainability of components and systems. These are part of the broad question of sustainability.

==Obstacles==
===Overfishing===

Overfishing can be sustainable. According to Hilborn, overfishing can be &quot;a misallocation of societies&#x27; resources&quot;, but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability&quot;.

Overfishing is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced. For example, Pacific salmon are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon, called the &quot;escapement&quot;, are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus. The optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus. If the escapement is half the optimum, then normal fishing looks like overfishing. But this is still sustainable fishing, which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield. There is a wide range of escapement sizes that present no threat that the stock might collapse or that the stock structure might erode.

On the other hand, overfishing can precede severe stock depletion and fishery collapse. Hilborn points out that continuing to exert fishing pressure while production decreases, stock collapses and the fishery fails, is largely &quot;the product of institutional failure&quot;.

Today over 70% of fish species are either fully exploited, overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion. If overfishing does not decrease, it is predicted that stocks of all species currently commercially fished for will collapse by 2048.

A Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) has been applied to the whaling industry, as well as charting the price of caviar, which depends on sturgeon stocks. Another example is North Sea cod. Comparing fisheries and mineral extraction tells us that human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a Hubbert depletion cycle.

===Habitat modification===
Nearly all the world&#x27;s continental shelves, and large areas of continental slopes, underwater ridges, and seamounts, have had heavy bottom trawls and dredges repeatedly dragged over their surfaces. For fifty years, governments and organizations, such as the Asian Development Bank, have encouraged the fishing industry to develop trawler fleets. Repeated bottom trawling and dredging literally flattens diversity in the benthic habitat, radically changing the associated communities.

===Changing the ecosystem balance===
Since 1950, 90 percent of 25 species of big predator fish have gone.

* Pauly, Daniel (2004) Reconciling Fisheries with Conservation: the Challenge of Managing Aquatic Ecosystems Fourth World Fisheries Congress, Vancouver, 2004.

===Climate change===
Rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are radically altering aquatic ecosystems. Climate change is modifying fish distribution and the productivity of marine and freshwater species. This reduces sustainable catch levels across many habitats, puts pressure on resources needed for aquaculture, on the communities that depend on fisheries, and on the oceans&#x27; ability to capture and store carbon (biological pump). Sea level rise puts coastal fishing communities at risk, while changing rainfall patterns and water use impact on inland (freshwater) fisheries and aquaculture. As climate change causes oceans to warm up, fish are forced to move away, into cooler Northern waters. This can cause overcrowding in these areas.

===Ocean pollution===
A recent survey of global ocean health concluded that all parts of the ocean have been affected by human development and that 41 percent has been fouled with human polluted runoff, overfishing, and other abuses. Pollution is not easy to fix, because pollution sources are so dispersed, and are built into the economic systems we depend on.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) mapped the impacts of stressors such as climate change, pollution, exotic species, and over-exploitation of resources on the oceans. The report shows at least 75 percent of the world&#x27;s key fishing grounds may be affected.

===Diseases and toxins===
Large predator fish can contain significant amounts of mercury, a neurotoxin which can affect fetal development, memory, mental focus, and produce tremors.

===Irrigation===
Lakes are dependent on the inflow of water from its drainage basin. In some areas, aggressive irrigation has caused this inflow to decrease significantly, causing water depletion and a shrinking of the lake. The most notable example is the Aral Sea, formerly among the four largest lakes in the world, now only a tenth of its former surface area.

==Remediation==

===Fisheries management===
Fisheries management draws on fisheries science to enable sustainable exploitation. Modern fisheries management is often defined as mandatory rules based on concrete objectives and a mix of management techniques, enforced by a monitoring control and surveillance system.

* Ideas and rules: Economist Paul Romer believes sustainable growth is possible providing the right ideas (technology) are combined with the right rules, rather than simply hectoring fishers. There has been no lack of innovative ideas about how to harvest fish. He characterizes failures as primarily failures to apply appropriate rules.

* Fishing subsidies: Government subsidies influence many of the world fisheries. Operating cost subsidies allow European and Asian fishing fleets to fish in distant waters, such as West Africa. Many experts reject fishing subsidies and advocate restructuring incentives globally to help struggling fisheries recover.

* Economics: Another focus of conservationists is on curtailing detrimental human activities by improving fisheries&#x27; market structure with techniques such as salable fishing quotas, like those set up by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, or laws such as those listed below.

* Valorization of by-catch: helping to avoid discards (and their associated adverse ecological impacts) by valorizing by-catch products, as they are good sources for protein hydrolizates, peptones, enzymatic mixtures or fish oil being these products of interest different industrial sectors.
*Payment for Ecosystem Services: Environmental economist Essam Y Mohammed argues that by creating direct economic incentives, whereby people are able to receive payment for the services their property provides, will help to establish sustainable fisheries around the world as well as inspire conservation where it otherwise would not.
* Sustainable fisheries certification: A promising direction is the independent certification programs for sustainable fisheries conducted by organizations such as the Marine Stewardship Council and Friend of the Sea. These programs work at raising consumer awareness and insight into the nature of their seafood purchases.
* Ecosystem based fisheries: See next section

===Ecosystem based fisheries===
According to marine ecologist Chris Frid, the fishing industry points to marine pollution and global warming as the causes of recent, unprecedented declines in fish populations. Frid counters that overfishing has also altered the way the ecosystem works:Everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences, human and natural, on fish dynamics. ... fish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular-sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects predator and prey dynamics. Fishing, however, is not the sole cause of changes to marine life—pollution is another example... No one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor.The traditional approach to fisheries science and management has been to focus on a single species. This can be contrasted with the ecosystem-based approach. Ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions. In a 2007 effort to &quot;stimulate much needed discussion&quot; and &quot;clarify the essential components&quot; of ecosystem-based fisheries science, a group of scientists offered the following ten commandments for ecosystem-based fisheries scientists:
===Marine protected areas===

Strategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines, such as population biology, with practical conservation strategies, such as setting up protected areas, as with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) or Voluntary Marine Conservation Areas. Each nation defines MPAs independently, but they commonly involve increased protection for the area from fishing and other threats.

Marine life is not evenly distributed in the oceans. Most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters, above or near the continental shelf, where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from land runoff or upwellings at the continental edge, allowing photosynthesis, which energizes the lowest trophic levels. In the 1970s, for reasons more to do with oil drilling than with fishing, the U.S. extended its jurisdiction, then 12 miles from the coast, to 200 miles. This made huge shelf areas part of its territory. Other nations followed, extending national control to what became known as the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This move has had many implications for fisheries conservation, since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions, opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws.

Daniel Pauly characterises marine protected areas as &quot;a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream.&quot; The Pew Charitable Trusts have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of MPAs and other ocean conservation measures.

===Sustainable Fish Farming===
Over the years, fish farming has made a name for itself in the fishing industry as a means of ensuring that the world&#x27;s fish supplies do not deplete so rapidly. Sometimes referred to as &quot;aquaculture&quot;, fish farming, when done right, &quot;can&quot; be one a very environmentally-friendly way to harvest fish. Fish farms are regulated by laws and management plans, which prevents it from falling prey to the same phenomenon of overfishing, which cripples the fish populations and marine ecosystem as a whole. The basic premise of fish farming is just what it sounds like—to breed and raise fish in enclosed environments, then eventually sell the grown fish as food for consumers. Salmon, cod, and halibut are three types of finfish that are often farm-raised. The actual enclosures in which the fish grow and swim are made of mesh &quot;cages&quot; submerged underwater.

Because they are not catching the fish out in the open ocean, fish farmers are able to control the environment in which the fish exist. Sustainable fish farming practices do not use dangerous chemicals, hormones, or antibiotics on their fish, which benefits the surrounding marine environment, and the human consumers themselves. In addition to this, sustainable fish farming is able to control what their fish eat: farmers will take care to keep the fish&#x27;s diet healthy and balanced. Conversely, one of the most unsustainable practices within the fish farming industry occurs is when farmers feed the fish pellets of animal waste. The quality of ocean water in and around fish farms is up to the farmers to maintain, and due to the fact that the mesh cages take up only a certain amount of space in the ocean, fish farmers can ensure that waste and other byproducts are not polluting the water. Everything from fish oils to fish skin may be incorporated into something new: for example, fish oils can become a beneficiary supplement for both animals and humans.

===Laws and treaties===
International laws and treaties related to marine conservation include the 1966 Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas. United States laws related to marine conservation include the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, as well as the 1972 Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act which established the National Marine Sanctuaries program. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

=== Reconciling fisheries with conservation ===
At the Fourth World Fisheries Congress in 2004, Daniel Pauly asked, &quot;How can fisheries science and conservation biology achieve a reconciliation?&quot;, then answered his own question, &quot;By accepting each other&#x27;s essentials: that fishing should remain a viable occupation; and that aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity are allowed to persist.&quot;

A relatively new concept is relationship farming. This is a way of operating farms so they restore the food chain in their area. Re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air, feeding its own food chain, and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting. An example is the large ranch Veta La Palma in 
Spain&#x27;s Guadalquivir Marshes, which for some years had a productive fishery. Relationship farming was first made popular by Joel Salatin who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in Michael Pollan&#x27;s book &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (2006) and the documentary films, &quot;Food, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot;. The basic concept of relationship farming is to put effort into building a healthy food chain, and then the food chain does the hard work.

=== Awareness campaigns ===
Various organizations promote sustainable fishing strategies, educate the public and stakeholders, and lobby for conservation law and policy. The list includes the Marine Conservation Biology Institute and Blue Frontier Campaign in the U.S., The U.K.&#x27;s Frontier (The Society for Environmental Exploration) and Marine Conservation Society, Australian Marine Conservation Society, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), Langkawi Declaration, Oceana, PROFISH, and the Sea Around Us Project, International Collective in Support of Fishworkers, World Forum of Fish Harvesters and Fish Workers, Frozen at Sea Fillets Association and CEDO.

Some organizations certify fishing industry players for sustainable or good practices, such as the Marine Stewardship Council and Friend of the Sea.

Other organizations offer advice to members of the public who eat with an eye to sustainability. According to the marine conservation biologist Callum Roberts, four criteria apply when choosing seafood:

* Is the species in trouble in the wild where the animals were caught?
* Does fishing for the species damage ocean habitats?
* Is there a large amount of bycatch taken with the target species?
* Does the fishery have a problem with discards—generally, undersized animals caught and thrown away because their market value is low?
The following organizations have download links for wallet-sized cards, listing good and bad choices:

* Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, USA
* Blue Ocean Institute, USA
* Marine Conservation Society, UK
* Australian Marine Conservation Society
* The Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative
=== Global goals ===
The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) include, as goal number 7: target 2, the intention to &quot;reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss&quot;, including improving fisheries management to reduce depletion of fish stocks.

In 2015, the MDGs then evolved to become the Sustainable Development Goals with Goal 14 aimed at conserving life below water. Its Target 14.7 states that &quot;By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism&quot;.

==Data issues==

===Data quality===
One of the major impediments to the rational control of marine resources is inadequate data. According to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison (2007), the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is poor data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be accurate. Scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.

===Unreported fishing===
Estimates of illegal catch losses range between $10 billion and $23 billion annually, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes.

* Incidental catch

===Shifting baselines===
Shifting baselines is the way significant changes to a system are measured against previous baselines, which themselves may represent significant changes from the original state of the system. The term was first used by the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly in his paper &quot;Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries&quot;. Pauly developed the term in reference to fisheries management where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct &quot;&quot; population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was &quot;before&quot; human exploitation) and thus work with a shifted baseline. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long-term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of perception of change that occurs when each generation redefines what is &quot;natural&quot;.

== History ==
In his 1883 inaugural address to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, Thomas Huxley asserted that overfishing or &quot;permanent exhaustion&quot; was scientifically impossible, and stated that probably &quot;all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible&quot;. In reality, by 1883 marine fisheries were already collapsing. The United States Fish Commission was established 12 years earlier for the purpose of finding why fisheries in New England were declining. At the time of Huxley&#x27;s address, the Atlantic halibut fishery had already collapsed (and has never recovered).

===Traditional management of fisheries===
Traditionally, fisheries management and the science underpinning it was distorted by its &quot;narrow focus on target populations and the corresponding failure to account for ecosystem effects leading to declines of species abundance and diversity&quot; and by perceiving the fishing industry as &quot;the sole legitimate user, in effect the owner, of marine living resources.&quot; Historically, stock assessment scientists usually worked in government laboratories and considered their work to be providing services to the fishing industry. These scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues. This happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated, and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements.

<text>C. Daniel Barrett is an attorney, legal author, and North Carolina political figure.

Barrett unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor in the 2004 election. His gubernatorial campaign was noted for its grassroots efforts, including Barrett personally walking across the length of the state from Murphy in the mountains to Manteo on the Outer Banks. Prior to that campaign, he served as Chairman of the Davie County Board of Commissioners.

In the 2008 general election, he ran for the North Carolina Court of Appeals, but was defeated by incumbent Judge Linda Stephens. He stated that he had a &quot;conservative judicial philosophy.&quot;
Dan Barrett&#x27;s 2008 candidacy was endorsed by several leading North Carolina political figures, including former Governor James G. Martin and former Governor James Holshouser.

Barrett was again elected to the Davie County Commission in 2014. He was a candidate for the open 13th district US Congressional seat in 2016 but finished 8th out of 17 candidates in the June Primary.

In August 2017, Barrett was selected to fill the seat of Sen. Andrew Brock, who retired. He has since served as the State Senator from the 34th District representing Davie, Rowan, and Iredell counties.

As part of a long battle over redistricting, Barrett found himself in a different state Senate district, in which long-time Republican Sen. Joyce Krawiec also resided. Barrett ran against Krawiec in the 2018 primaries and narrowly lost, according to unofficial results.

Barrett is a graduate of Wake Forest University and Wake Forest University School of Law. Barrett is the author of a book on labor and employment law.

<text>William Wilfred Cobey Jr. (born May 13, 1939) is an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served one term in the United States House of Representatives for North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1985 to 1987.

==Biography ==
Cobey was born in Washington, D.C. and reared in the suburb of University Park in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. His father, William W. Cobey, Sr., was the athletic director for the University of Maryland from 1956 to 1969. Cobey is a graduate of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. Cobey also earned an M.B.A. in Marketing from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and an M.Ed. from the University of Pittsburgh.

=== Early career ===
Cobey originally worked as a bank administrative assistant and then as a chemical salesman. In 1968, he became, like his father, an athletic administrator. From 1976 to 1980, he was athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In the early 1980s, he was the president of his own corporation, Cobey &amp; Associates.

=== Congress ===
In 1980, Cobey was the Republican nominee for North Carolina Lieutenant Governor. In 1984, he was elected to represent North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district in the U.S. Congress. However, he was defeated in a bid for re-election in 1986 by the Democrat David Price.

== Later career ==
After serving in Congress, Cobey joined the administration of North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, first as Deputy Secretary of Transportation and then as Secretary of the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources. After serving as town manager of Morrisville, North Carolina, he did government relations consulting for Capitol Link, Inc.

Cobey served two terms (1999–2003) as the voluntary chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. He replaced Sam Currin. Under Cobey&#x27;s leadership, the state party purchased a new headquarters building. He was succeeded by Ferrell Blount as party chair.

Cobey was one of the leading candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Democratic Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election. In July 2003, Cobey received the endorsement of former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms in the Republican primary contest. Rarely had Helms endorsed any candidate in primaries, other than Ronald W. Reagan for the 1976 presidential nomination. In the July 2004 Republican primary, Cobey ran a strong third with 26.7% of the vote (97,461 votes), lagging behind nominee Patrick Ballantine (30.3% and 110,726 votes) and Richard Vinroot (29.9% and 109,217 votes).

In 2007-2008, Cobey was the North Carolina campaign chairman for defeated presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas.

From 2005-2012, Cobey was a presidential-appointee to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of Directions, which governs Reagan National and Dulles Airports. He is a former chairman of the board at Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill, a former board chairman of the Jesse Helms Foundation, and a former president of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro YMCA. From 2013-2018, he was chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Education, a board member for the NC Center for the Advancement of Teaching (NCCAT), a member of the NC Education Workforce Innovation Commission, and a member of the governor&#x27;s education cabinet.

== Personal life ==
Cobey resides in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with his wife, Nancy. They have two children and five grandchildren.

<text>Clara Reisenberg Rockmore ( Reisenberg; 9 March 1911 – 10 May 1998) was a Litvak classical violin prodigy and a virtuoso performer of the theremin, an electronic musical instrument. She was the sister of pianist Nadia Reisenberg.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Clara Rockmore was born in Vilnius, then in the Russian Empire, to a family of Litvaks. She had two elder sisters, Anna and Nadia. Early in her childhood she emerged as a violin prodigy. At the age of four, she became the youngest ever student at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where she studied under the prominent violinist Leopold Auer. After the October Revolution the family moved back to Vilnius, and then to Warsaw, before obtaining visas and leaving for the United States in 1921.

In America, Rockmore enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music. As a teenager, tendinitis affected her bow arm, attributed to childhood malnutrition, and resulted in her giving up the violin. However, after meeting fellow immigrant Léon Theremin and being introduced to his electronic instrument, the theremin, she became its most prominent player. She performed widely and helped Theremin to refine his instrument.

===Career===
Rockmore made orchestral appearances in New York and Philadelphia and went on coast-to-coast tours with Paul Robeson, but it was not until 1977 that she released a commercial recording called &quot;The Art of the Theremin&quot;. The album, which was produced by Bob Moog and Shirleigh Moog, featured Rockmore&#x27;s theremin playing with piano accompaniment by her sister Nadia. Rockmore&#x27;s approach to theremin playing emphasized physical and emotional control.

As she described it herself in an interview: &quot;You must not only hit a note, but you must hit the center of it. You cannot register any of your internal emotion at all. You cannot shake your head, for instance, or sway back and forth on your feet. That would change your tone.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Although Léon Theremin had proposed to her once, she married attorney Robert Rockmore, and thereafter used his name professionally. They had no children.

She died in New York City on May 10, 1998, aged 87. Although her health had been in rapid decline for almost a year, she declared her determination to live to see the birth of her great-grandniece, who was born just two days before her death.

==Contributions to the theremin==
Rockmore&#x27;s classical training gave her an advantage over the many other theremin performers of the time. The intonation control she acquired as a violinist and her innate absolute pitch were both helpful in playing the instrument.

She had extremely precise, rapid control of her movements, important in playing an instrument that depends on the performer&#x27;s motion and proximity rather than touch. She developed a unique technique for playing the instrument, including a fingering system that allowed her to perform accurately fast passages and large note leaps without the more familiar portamento, or glide, on theremin.

She also discovered that she could achieve a steadier tone and control the vibrato by keeping the tips of her right-hand thumb and forefinger in contact.

===Developmental influence===
Rockmore saw limitations of the original instrument and helped to develop the theremin to fulfill her needs. Working together with Léon Theremin her suggestions and changes included increasing the sensitivity of the theremin&#x27;s volume control to facilitate rapid staccato, lowering the profile of the instrument so the performer is more visible, increasing the sensitivity of the pitch antenna, and increasing range from three octaves to five.

===Public influence===
By the time Rockmore was playing large scale public concerts, such as New York City&#x27;s Town Hall in 1938, she was becoming increasingly known for impressing critics with her artistry of the theremin during a time in which much of the general public had come to rather negative conclusions of what was possible on the instrument.

These performances with world class orchestras were also critical in establishing “electronic and experimental music as a viable art form in the public imagination.” 

Clara owned an RCA theremin given to her and substantially modified by Theremin. Through his modifications, the instrument&#x27;s normal 5 to 5.5 octave playable range was expanded by 1.5 octaves. Theremin made several other customizations including improvements to tonal quality and its responsiveness to hand movements. The tubes are also customized and labeled in Theremin&#x27;s own writing.

This instrument was later restored by Robert Moog in October 1998; it can be viewed at the Clara Rockmore exhibit in the Artist&#x27;s Gallery of the Musical Instruments Museum in Phoenix, Arizona and is on long-term loan to the museum by Peter Sherman of the Reisenberg family.

<doc id="481294" wikidata="Q233770" url="?curid=481294" title="Cape York Peninsula">
<text>The Cape York Peninsula is a peninsula located in Far North Queensland, Australia. It is the largest wilderness in northern Australia. The land is mostly flat and about half of the area is used for grazing cattle. The relatively undisturbed eucalyptus-wooded savannahs, tropical rainforests and other types of habitat are now recognised and preserved for their global environmental significance. Although much of the peninsula remains pristine, with a diverse repertoire of endemic flora and fauna, some of its wildlife may be threatened by industry and overgrazing as well as introduced species and weeds.

The northernmost point of the peninsula is Cape York.
The land has been occupied by a number of Aboriginal Australian peoples for tens of thousands of years. In 1606, Dutch sailor Willem Janszoon on board the &quot;Duyfken&quot; was the first European to land in Australia, reaching the Cape York Peninsula.

==History==
=== European exploration ===

In February 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon landed near the site of what is now Weipa, on the western shore of Cape York Peninsula. This was the first recorded landing of a European in Australia, and it also marked the first reported contact between European and Aboriginal Australian people.

Edmund Kennedy was the first European explorer to attempt an overland expedition of Cape York Peninsula. He had been second-in-command to Thomas Livingstone Mitchell in 1846 when the Barcoo River was encountered. The aim was to establish a route to the tip of the peninsula, where Sydney businessmen were attempting development of a port for trade with the East Indies.

The expedition set out from Rockingham Bay near the present town of Cardwell in May 1848, and it turned out to be one of the great disasters of Australian exploration. Of the thirteen men who set out, only three survived. The others died of fever or starvation, or were speared by hostile Aboriginal people. Kennedy died of spear wounds almost within sight of his destination in December 1848. The only survivor to complete the journey was Jackey Jackey, an Aboriginal man from New South Wales. He led a rescue party to the other two who had been unable to continue.

The tip of the peninsula (Cape York) was finally reached by Europeans in 1864 when the brothers Francis Lascelles (Frank) and Alexander William Jardine, along with eight companions, drove a mob of cattle from Rockhampton to the new settlement of Somerset (on Cape York) where the Jardines&#x27; father was commander. En route they lost most of their horses, many of their stores and fought pitched battles with Aboriginal people, finally arriving in March 1865.

===First contact===
The first known contact between European and Aboriginal people occurred on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606, but it was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities, then stations and later mining towns were established. European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland.

== Geography and geology ==

The west coast borders the Gulf of Carpentaria and the east coast borders the Coral Sea. The peninsula is bordered by water on three sides (north, east and west). There is no clear demarcation to the south, although the official boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland runs along at about 16°S latitude.
At the peninsula&#x27;s widest point, it is from the Bloomfield River in the southeast, across to the west coast just south of the aboriginal community of Kowanyama. It is some from the southern border of Cook Shire, to the tip of Cape York.

At the tip of the peninsula lies Cape York, the northernmost point on the Australian mainland. It was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 21 August 1770 in honour of Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, a brother of King George III of the United Kingdom, who had died three years earlier:

The tropical landscapes are among the most stable in the world. Long undisturbed by tectonic activity, the peninsula is an extremely eroded, almost level low plain dominated by meandering rivers and vast floodplains, with some very low hills rising to elevation in the McIlwraith Range on the eastern side around Coen.

The backbone of Cape York Peninsula is the peninsula ridge, part of Australia&#x27;s Great Dividing Range. This mountain range is made up of ancient (1.5 billion-year-old) Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks. To the east and west of the peninsula ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins, respectively, themselves made up of ancient Mesozoic sediments. There are several outstanding landforms on the peninsula: the large expanses of undisturbed dunefields at the eastern coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford-Cape Flattery, the huge piles of black granite boulders at Kalkajaka National Park and Cape Melville, and the limestone karsts around Palmerston in the peninsula&#x27;s far south.

===Soil===
The soils are remarkably infertile even compared to other areas of Australia, being almost entirely laterised and in most cases so old and weathered that very little development is apparent today (classified in USDA soil taxonomy as orthents). It is because of this extraordinary soil poverty that the region is so thinly settled: the soils are so unworkable and unresponsive to fertilisers that attempts to grow commercial crops have usually failed.

===Climate===
The climate on Cape York Peninsula is tropical savanna in the south, with a heavy monsoon season from November to April, during which time the forest becomes almost uninhabitable, and a dry season from May to October. The temperature is warm to hot, with a cooler climate in higher areas. The mean annual temperatures range from at higher elevations to on the lowlands in the drier southwest. Temperatures over and below are rare.

Annual rainfall is high, ranging from over in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about at the southern border. Almost all this rain falls between November and April, and only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the median rainfall between June and September above . Between January and March, however, the median monthly rainfall ranges from about in the south to over in the north and on the Iron Range.
===Rivers===
The Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea. To the west, a series of large, winding river systems including the Mitchell, Staaten, Coleman, Holroyd, Archer, Watson, Wenlock, Ducie and Jardine catchments empty their waters into the Gulf of Carpentaria. During the dry season, those rivers are reduced to a series of waterholes and sandy beds. Yet, with the arrival of torrential rains in the wet season, they swell to mighty waterways, spreading across extensive floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to a vast array of freshwater and wetland species.

On the Eastern slopes, the shorter, faster-flowing Jacky Jacky Creek, Olive, Pascoe, Lockhart, Stewart, Jeannie and Endeavour Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea, providing important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the Great Barrier Reef. On their way, those wild, undisturbed rivers are lined with dense rainforests, sand dunes or mangroves.
The floodplains of the Laura Basin, which are protected in the Rinyirru and Jack River National Parks, are crossed by the Morehead, Hann, North Kennedy, Laura, Jack and Normanby Rivers.

The Peninsula&#x27;s river catchments are noted for their exceptional hydrological integrity. With little disturbance on both water flows and vegetation cover throughout entire catchments, Cape York Peninsula has been identified as one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain essentially intact. Cape York Peninsula contributes as much as a quarter of Australia&#x27;s surface runoff. Indeed, with only about 2.7 percent of Australia&#x27;s land area, it produces more run-off than all of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Tapping those heavy tropical rainfalls, the peninsula&#x27;s rivers are also of particular importance for replenishing central Australia&#x27;s Great Artesian Basin. The Queensland Government is currently poised to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsula&#x27;s wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005.

===Geological history===
The peninsula is formed from the northern part of the Great Dividing Range, folded during the Carboniferous period some 300 million years ago, when Australia collided with what is now parts of South America and New Zealand. The range has experienced significant erosion since. 
Around 40 million years ago, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it collided with the Pacific Plate on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea emerged around 5 million years ago. In the lee of this collision zone, the ancient rock formations of what is now Cape York Peninsula remained largely undisturbed.

Throughout the Pleistocene epoch Australia and New Guinea were alternately land-linked and separated by water. During periods of glaciation and resulting low sea levels, Cape York Peninsula provided a low-lying land link. Another link existed between Arnhem Land and New Guinea, at times enclosing an enormous freshwater lake (Lake Carpentaria) in the centre of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria. Australia and New Guinea remained connected in this way until the shallow Torres Strait was last flooded around 8,000 years ago.

== People and culture today==
Today the peninsula has a population of only about 18,000, of which a large percentage (~60%) are Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.

The administrative and commercial centre for much of Cape York Peninsula is Cooktown, located in its far southeastern corner while the peninsula&#x27;s largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The remainder is extremely sparsely populated, with about half the population living in very small settlements and cattle ranches. Along the peninsula developmental road, there are small service centres at Lakeland, Laura and Coen. About offshore north of the tip of Cape York, there is a sizeable service centre on nearby Thursday Island. Aboriginal communities are at Hopevale, Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Lockhart River, Napranum, Mapoon, Injinoo, New Mapoon and Umagico. Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at Bamaga and Seisia. A completely sealed inland road links Cairns and the Atherton Tableland to Lakeland and Cooktown. The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season (roughly December to May).

The peninsula is a popular tourist destination in the dry season for camping, hiking, bird watching and fishing enthusiasts. Many people make the adventurous, but rewarding, drive to the tip of Cape York, the northernmost point of mainland Australia.

Some of the world&#x27;s most extensive and ancient Aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura, some of which are available for public viewing. There is also a new interpretive centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged.

=== Indigenous languages and peoples===

Over 30 Aboriginal languages are spoken on Cape York Peninsula, including Linngithigh, Umpila, Wik Mungkan, Wik-Me&#x27;nh, Wik-Ngathan, Kugu Nganhcara, Guugu Yalandji, Guugu Yimithirr, Kuuk Thaayorre and a multitude of Australian Aboriginal sign languages. Some of these languages are being acquired by children or are spoken by all generations in remote communities. Most Wik languages are being quickly absorbed by Wik-Mungkan, which seems to be the only aboriginal language on the peninsula that is developing very quickly, as it is the second language of the Wikalkan, Wik-Ngathana, and Wikngenchera.

Djagaraga (also known as Yadhaigana, Dyagaraga and Yagulleone) is an Australian Aboriginal language from the tip of Cape York. The language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council. Traditionally the language was spoken on Eastern Cape York particularly in the localities of Albany Island and Mount Adolphus Island.

Linngithigh (also known as Winda Winda and Linginiti) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Linngithigh people. The Linngithigh language region includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire Council: Western Cape York, Winda Winda Creek, Mission River, and Archer River.

Luthigh (also known as Lotiga, Tepiti and Uradhi, see also Uradhi related languages) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Luthigh people. The traditional language area for Luthigh includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire: Eastern Cape York, Ducie River, Northern Peninsula, New Mapoon, Injinoo, and Cowal Creek.

Teppathiggi (also known Tepithiki and Teyepathiggi) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Western Cape York, Middle Dulcie River, Lower Batavia River, Ducie River, and Mapoon. The language region includes areas within the local government boundaries of Cook Shire Council.

Thaynakwith (also known as Awngthim, Tainikuit and Winduwinda) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Western Cape York in the Weipa area taking in Albatross Bay and Mission River. The language region includes areas within the local government boundaries of Weipa Town Council and Cook Shire.

Uradhi (also known as Anggamudi, Ankamuti, Atampaya, Bawtjathi, and Lotiga) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Western Cape York Peninsula. The traditional language region includes north of Mapoon and Duyfken Point and east of the coast strip to the north of Port Musgrave (Angkamuthi country) incorporating the mouth of the Ducie River, the lower reaches of the Dulhunty River and the upper reaches of the Skardon River in the north. Following the displacement of Indigenous people by British settlement, it was also spoken in the Northern Peninsula Area Region including the communities of New Mapoon, Injinoo and Cowal Creek.

Yir Yiront (also known as Yiront, Jirjoront, Yir-yiront, and Kokomindjan) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is in Western Cape York within the local government areas of Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama and Shire of Cook, in the catchments of the Coleman River and Mitchell River. Following the removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, it is also spoken in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama.

Kuuku Ya&#x27;u (also known as Gugu Yau, Yao, Ya&#x27;o, Koko Ya&#x27;o and Koka-yao) is an Australian Aboriginal language. The traditional language area of Kuuku Ya&#x27;u includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire: Eastern Cape York, Uu&#x27;ungun south to Claudie River and hinterland.

Kuuk Thaayorre (also known as Koko-Daiyuri, Kuku Yak, Thayorre, and used as a generic name for several related languages/dialects) is an Australian Aboriginal Language spoken on Western Cape York Peninsula, particularly in the area around Pormpuraaw (Edward River). The Thaayorre language region includes the landscape within Pormpuraaw Community Council and the Cook Shire Council.

===Native title claims===

The Cape York Land Council, established in 1990 as a land council, has fought for native title rights, and has won such rights over 45% per cent of the region by around 2018.

On 25 November 2021, of land on the eastern side of the peninsula were handed back to the Kuuku Ya&#x27;u and Uutaalnganu peoples, in a native title claim that was lodged seven years prior. The landmark ruling was delivered by Justice Debra Mortimer of the Federal Court of Australia, sitting at the Supreme Court of Queensland in Cairns.

In December 2022 the Federal Court recognised the native title claims for the Kaurareg, Kulkulgal, Kemer Kemer Meriam, Ankamuthi, and Gudang/Yadhaykenu peoples.

== Ecology ==

===Flora===
Cape York Peninsula supports a complex mosaic of intact tropical rainforests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, heath lands, wetlands, wild rivers and mangrove swamps. The savannah woodlands consist typically of a tall dense grass layer and varying densities of trees, predominantly eucalypt of which the most common is Darwin stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus tetrodonta&quot;). These various habitats are home to about 3300 species of flowering plants and almost the entire area of Cape York Peninsula (99.6%) still retains its native vegetation and is little fragmented. Although abundant and fully functioning on the peninsula, tropical savannahs are now rare and highly degraded in other parts of the world. Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of endemism in Australia, with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far. Therefore, parts of the peninsula have been noted for their exceptionally high wilderness quality. 
The flora of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species, plants that have emerged since the breakup of Gondwana and species from Indomalaya and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea with the most variety being found in the rainforest areas. Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than nearby New Guinea which limits the rainforest plants of that island from migrating across to Australia.

Tropical rainforests cover an area of , or 5.6 percent of the total land area of Cape York Peninsula. Rainforests depend on some level of rainfall throughout the long dry season, climatic conditions that are mostly found on the eastern slopes of the peninsula&#x27;s coastal ranges. Being almost exclusively untouched, old-growth forests and supporting a disproportionately high biodiversity including flora of Gondwanan and New Guinean origin, the rainforests are of high conservation significance. The largest contiguous rainforest area on the peninsula occurs in the McIllwraith Range-Iron Range area. The Gondwanan flora of this area includes Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae conifers and &quot;Arthrochilus&quot;, &quot;Corybas&quot;, and &quot;Calochilus&quot; orchids. In all, this rainforest contains at least 1000 different plants, including 100 rare or threatened species, and 16% of Australia&#x27;s orchid species.

On poor, dry soils tropical heathlands can be found. Northeast Cape York Peninsula supports Australia&#x27;s largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem.

The extensive wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are &quot;among the largest, richest and most diverse in Australia&quot;. 19 wetlands of national significance have been identified, mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas. Important wetlands include the Apudthama Complex, Rinyirru systems and the estuaries of the great rivers of the western plains. Many of these wetlands come into existence only during the wet season and support rare or uncommon plant communities.

The peninsula&#x27;s coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with mangrove forests of kwila and other trees. Australia&#x27;s largest mangrove forest can be found at Newcastle Bay.

===Fauna===
The peninsula harbours an extraordinary biodiversity, with more than 700 vertebrate land animal species of which 40 are endemic. As a result, from its geological history, &quot;the flora and fauna of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics, Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders&quot; (p. 41). Birds of the peninsula include buff-breasted buttonquail (&quot;Turnix olivii&quot;), golden-shouldered parrot (&quot;Psephotus chrysopterygius&quot;), lovely fairywren (&quot;Malurus amabilis&quot;), white-streaked honeyeater (&quot;Trichodere cockerelli&quot;), and yellow-spotted honeyeater (&quot;Meliphaga notata&quot;) while some such as pied oystercatcher are found in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula. The peninsula is also home to the eastern brown snake, one of the world&#x27;s most venomous snakes. Mammals include the rodent Cape York melomys, related to the extinct Bramble Cay melomys, which was found only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait and confirmed extinct in 2016.

The rainforests of the Kutini-Payamu National Park support species that are also found in New Guinea, including the eclectus parrot and southern common cuscus. Other rainforest fauna includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge green birdwing, the green tree python and the northern quoll, a forest marsupial that is now severely depleted from eating the introduced poisonous cane toads.

The riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own while the rivers including the Jardine, Jackson, Olive, Holroyd and the Wenlock are rich in fish. The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and crocodile habitat, providing important drought refuge and finally the Great Barrier Reef lies off the east coast and is an important marine habitat.

===Threats and preservation===
Cattle station leases occupy about 57% of the total area, mostly located in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula. Indigenous land comprises about 20%, with the entire West coast being held under native title. The remainder is mostly declared as National Park and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. Land uses include broad-acre pastoralism, bauxite and silica sand mining, nature reserves, tourism and fishing.

There are extensive deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast. Weipa is the centre for mining. Much has been damaged by overgrazing, mining, poorly controlled fires and feral pigs, cane toads, weeds, and other introduced species but Cape York Peninsula remains fairly unspoilt with intact and healthy river systems and no recorded plant or animal extinction since European settlement.

The &quot;Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy&quot; study was commissioned by the Australian government in 1990 to create plans to protect the wilderness and a nomination for World Natural Heritage is currently being considered by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments. Major national parks include the Apudthama National Park in the far north, Oyala Thumotang National Park near Aurukun, and Rinyirru National Park in the southeast of the bioregion. On 16 June 2024, a submission was made for the Cape York Peninsula to be a mixed world-heritage site under the title &quot;Cultural Landscapes of Cape York Peninsula&quot;.
== Transport ==
There are two roads passing north–south through Cape York Peninsula to Cape York: the Peninsula Developmental Road (PDR) and the Northern Peninsula Road (also called Bamaga Road and Telegraph Road).

Bamaga Road now bypasses the overland telegraph line (OTL) track, which is often referred to as the tele track. The tele track was used for construction and maintenance of the OTL until it was superseded by first microwave relay towers and then by fibre optic cables, and is now used by four-wheel drive vehicle enthusiasts in the dry season. Many crossings, such as the bridge over the Wenlock near Moreton station, have been upgraded; however, many fords remain. The roads are unsealed and in places are difficult to traverse. They are considered suitable for four-wheel-drive vehicles only and also considered only suitable to be driven in the dry season.

In 1986, Cape York became the proposed site of a spaceport, which a consortium of companies, the Cape York Space Agency, promoted with support from the federal government. In 1992, investor support failed, and in 2017, legal ownership of of land required was returned to the Wuthathi, Kuku Yau and Northern Kaanju people. The development, which was heavily supported by Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, would have included a new town, tourist resorts, an airport and a harbour.

<text>Baron Rossmore, of Monaghan in the County of Monaghan, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1796 for the soldier Robert Cuninghame, with remainder to his wife Elizabeth&#x27;s nephews Henry Alexander Jones (the son of Theophilus Jones and Anne Murray, eldest sister of Elizabeth; Henry Alexander Jones died childless before his uncle Lord Rossmore) and Warner William Westenra, son of Henry Westenra and Harriet Murray, youngest sister of Elizabeth. Cuninghame was a General in the Army and served as Commander-in-Chief of Ireland. From January to August 1801 he also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer.

Lord Rossmore died childless (his death gave rise to the legend of the Rossmore banshee) and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew Warner William Westenra, the second Baron. He represented Monaghan in the British House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan from 1831 to 1842. In 1838 he was created Baron Rossmore, of the County of Monaghan, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This gave the barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His eldest son, Henry Robert Westenra, the third Baron, represented Monaghan in Parliament as a Whig and was Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan from 1843 to 1852. Henry&#x27;s younger son, the fifth Baron (who succeeded his elder unmarried brother), was Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan from 1897 to 1921. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

The Westenra family is of Dutch descent. Warner Westenra (died 1676) immigrated to Dublin and became an Irish subject. The seat of the Barons Rossmore was Rossmore Castle, County Monaghan. Warner Westenra, grandfather of the second Baron, represented Maryborough in the Irish Parliament. Henry Westenra, father of the second Baron, represented County Monaghan in the Irish Parliament. The Honourable John Westenra, third son of the second Baron, was Member of Parliament for King&#x27;s County.

The family seat was Rossmore Park, near Monaghan, County Monaghan, in Ireland.

<text>Baron Rendlesham, of Rendlesham, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1806 for the businessman Peter Thellusson, who also represented Midhurst, Malmesbury and Bossiney in Parliament. The Thellusson (pronounced &quot;Tellusson&quot;) family were of French Protestant origin, but settled in Geneva, Switzerland, after the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 1572.

A later member of the family, Peter Thellusson, emigrated to England in 1762 where he established a successful London business. From the wealth acquired, he purchased several estates around the country, notably Brodsworth Hall in South Yorkshire. After his death his estate was embroiled in the Thellusson Will Case.

His eldest son was the aforementioned Peter Isaac Thellusson, 1st Baron Rendlesham, who took over the family business. Lord Rendlesham&#x27;s younger son, the fourth Baron (who succeeded his twin brother), sat as a Member of Parliament for Suffolk East. His only son, the fifth Baron, also represented this constituency (as a Conservative). the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1999.

<text>Louis Stanton Auchincloss (; September 27, 1917 – January 26, 2010) was an American lawyer, novelist, historian, and essayist. He is best known as a novelist who parlayed his experiences into books exploring the experiences and psychology of American polite society and old money. His dry, ironic works of fiction continue the tradition of Henry James and Edith Wharton. He wrote his novels initially under the name Andrew Lee, the name of an ancestor who cursed any descendant who drank or smoked.

==Early life==
Born in Lawrence, New York, Auchincloss was the son of Priscilla Dixon (née Stanton) and Joseph Howland Auchincloss. His brother was Howland Auchincloss and his paternal grandfather, John Winthrop Auchincloss, was the brother of Edgar Stirling Auchincloss (father of James C. Auchincloss) and Hugh Dudley Auchincloss (father of Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr.). He grew up among the privileged people about whom he would write, although, as he put it, &quot;There was never an Auchincloss fortune ... each generation of Auchincloss men either made or married its own money&quot;.

He attended St. Bernard&#x27;s School, Groton School and Yale University, where he was editor of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;. Although he did not complete his undergraduate studies at Yale, he was admitted to and attended law school at the University of Virginia. He graduated in 1941 and was admitted to the New York bar the same year.

==Career==
Auchincloss was an associate at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell from 1941 to 1951 (with an interruption for war service from 1942 to 1945 in the United States Navy during World War II, which might have inspired his 1947 novel &quot;The Indifferent Children&quot;). He applied to join the Naval Reserve as an intelligence specialist on December 4, 1940 and was appointed as a lieutenant on December 1, 1942.

After taking a break to pursue full-time writing, Auchincloss returned to working as a lawyer, first as an associate (1954–58) and then as a partner (1958–86) at Hawkins, Delafield and Wood in New York City as a wills and trusts attorney, while writing at the rate of a book a year.

===Literary career===
Auchincloss is known for his closely observed portraits of old New York and New England society. Among his books are the multi-generational sagas &quot;The House of Five Talents&quot; (1960), &quot;Portrait in Brownstone&quot; (1962), and &quot;East Side Story&quot; (2004). &quot;The Rector of Justin&quot; (1964) is the tale of a renowned headmaster of a prep school like the one he attended, Groton School, trying to deal with changing times.

In the early 1980s, Auchincloss produced three novels which were not centered on the New York he knew so well, i.e. &quot;The Cat and the King&quot;, set in Louis XIV&#x27;s Versailles, &quot;Watchfires&quot;, concerned with the American Civil War, and &quot;Exit Lady Masham&quot;, set in Queen Anne&#x27;s England. Auchincloss would remain close to New York again, however, in his later fiction writing.

Gore Vidal said of his work: &quot;Of all our novelists, Auchincloss is the only one who tells us how our rulers behave in their banks and their boardrooms, their law offices and their clubs ... Not since Dreiser has an American writer had so much to tell us about the role of money in our lives.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1957, Auchincloss married Adele Burden Lawrence (1931–1991), the daughter of Florence Irvin (née Burden) Lawrence and Blake Leigh Lawrence. Her grandfather was prominent industrialist James A. Burden Jr. and her great-grandmother was Vanderbilt heiress Emily Thorn (née Vanderbilt) Sloane White. Adele was an artist, environmentalist and later became a deputy administrator of the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. Together they had three children:

* Andrew Sloan Auchincloss, a lawyer who married Tracy Lee Ehrlich in 1999.
* John Winthrop Auchincloss II, a lawyer who married Dr. Tracy Pennoyer, daughter of lawyer Robert Morgan Pennoyer, and sister of architect Peter Pennoyer (both great-grandchildren of J.P. Morgan Jr.), in April 1988.
* Blake Leigh Auchincloss, an architect who married in Lauren Stewart Moores, a daughter of John Duer Moores Jr., in June 1988.

He was president and chairman of the Museum of the City of New York and chairman of the City Hall Restoration Committee and was a member of the Century Association and the American Academy of Arts and Letters, where he served as president.

On January 26, 2010, Auchincloss died from complications of a stroke at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

===Politics===
In his youth, Auchincloss was a &quot;a Roosevelt-hating conservative.&quot; Once, while attending Yale, he waved a sunflower (the symbol of Republican Alfred Landon) at President Roosevelt&#x27;s passing motorcade. Auchincloss wrote conservative articles in &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot;, which have been described as expressing &quot;a nostalgic and romantic idealism&quot;.

In his adult life, Auchincloss was a registered Republican. However, he voted for Democrat Bill Clinton explaining, &quot;I think we’re moving dangerously into a have and have not situation ... for the first time in 150 years the rich are sneering at the poor.&quot;

Auchincloss described the Bush Family as “a big family of shits.&quot; He explained his decision to receive the National Medal of the Arts from President George W. Bush, saying, &quot;I didn’t accept a prize from George W Bush, I accepted a prize from the President of the United States. Who am I to turn that down?&quot;

===Awards and legacy===
Significant collections of Auchincloss&#x27;s papers reside at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia and at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. In addition, he was the recipient of the following awards and accolades:
*National Book Award Finalist (1960, 1961, 1965, 1967)
*Member, American Academy of Arts and Letters (1965)

The barony of Rathdonnell was the second-last barony created in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Rathdonnell was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baron, who sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1889 to 1929 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Carlow between 1890 and 1922. the title is held by the fifth Baron, the second Baron&#x27;s great-grandson, who succeeded his father in 1959.

The Arctic explorer, Admiral Sir Francis McClintock, was the nephew of the first Baron.

The family seat is Lisnavagh House, near Rathvilly, County Carlow.

<text>ArsDigita, LLC, was a web development company founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1997. The company produced a popular open source toolkit, the ArsDigita Community System (ACS), for building database-backed community websites, and flourished at the peak of the dot-com bubble. ACS was also the roots of OpenACS, which added PostgreSQL as a database option and gave the system a fully open-source stack.

==History==
===Foundation===

ArsDigita was founded by Philip Greenspun, Tracy Adams, Ben Adida, Eve Andersson, Olin Shivers, Aurelius Prochazka, and Jin Choi. Recruitment for the company was touted heavily by Greenspun, and ArsDigita became notorious among the &quot;elite geeks&quot; as a place where recruiting could result in significant payoffs. During the spring of 1999, for example, recruiting 5 hires would earn the employee a Honda S2000. Recruiting 10 employees would net a Ferrari F355. A trophy F355 in bright yellow was kept parked outside of the Prospect Street office in Cambridge to entice employees into recruiting. Later in the summer of 1999, as new management was brought on board, the policy was quietly changed to a lease of the cars, not outright ownership.

===ArsDigita Foundation and ArsDigita University===
The founders set up a nonprofit organization, the ArsDigita Foundation, which sponsored the ArsDigita Prize, a programming contest for high-school students held in 1999, 2000, and 2001.

In 2000, a free intensive one-year post-baccalaureate program in computer science was announced, called ArsDigita University. It was based on the undergraduate course of study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and financed and supported by the ArsDigita Foundation. The majority of the instructors were professors from MIT and the program was tuition free.

Potential recruits were required to submit solutions to a handful of problem sets used in an Internet application development course at MIT. Some of these problem sets required the use of the Oracle object-relational database management system behind Web pages. Others were basic computer science problems such as computing a Fibonacci series recursively using the Tcl programming language.

After running from September 2000 through July 2001, seeing the first class to graduation, the dissolution of the ArsDigita Foundation forced the program to shut down. Most of the course lectures were videotaped. The tapes and other course materials are available free under the Open Content License from aduni.org, a website maintained by the alumni of the university. That site exists to carry on the school&#x27;s mission of supplying free education, and streams ~150GB/month of lectures to thousands of people around the world. A 4-DVD set containing the videos and course materials (problem sets, exams, solution sets, and course notes) is also available for a fee. The tapes were made available on Google Video in 2008 allowing easier and more flexible access.

Former instructor Holly Yanco became a University of Massachusetts Lowell computer science professor and was named a 2013 Woman to Watch.

===Dissolution===
Approximately 180 ArsDigita employees were hired at the company&#x27;s peak, but with the crash of the dot-com economy, many of ArsDigita&#x27;s clients went out of business. Others cut back heavily on their technology initiatives. The weight of payroll and offices in Cambridge, Berkeley, California, Washington D.C., and Ann Arbor, Michigan soon overwhelmed the company. The Ann Arbor office was closed in September, 2000, with the other offices following over the next few months. 

ArsDigita took $38 million in venture capital investment from Greylock and General Atlantic in 2000 to provide working capital for expansion of its product line. Greenspun said the venture capitalists staged an internal coup to drive the founders out of the management structure and installed incompetent professional managers with little idea of how to run a software products company, resulting in the collapse of the company and a lawsuit between the founding shareholders and the venture capitalists over control of management. Michael Yoon, who was an ArsDigita employee at the time, said ArsDigita had other management problems as well. The lawsuit was settled out of court with Greenspun receiving $7.6M.

In 2002, ArsDigita&#x27;s main assets (including the pinball machine and several pieces of artwork) were acquired by Red Hat.

<doc id="481309" wikidata="Q7597225" url="?curid=481309" title="Stale pointer bug">
<text>A stale pointer bug, otherwise known as an aliasing bug, is a class of subtle programming errors that can arise in code that does dynamic memory allocation, especially via the malloc function or equivalent.

If several pointers address (are &quot;aliases for&quot;) a given chunk of storage, it may happen that the storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through one alias and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle (and possibly intermittent) errors depending on the state and the allocation history of the malloc arena. This bug can be avoided by never creating aliases for allocated memory, by controlling the dynamic scope of references to the storage so that none can remain when it is freed, or by use of a garbage collector, in the form of an intelligent memory-allocation library or as provided by higher-level languages, such as Lisp.

The term &quot;aliasing bug&quot; is nowadays associated with C programming, but it was already in use in a very similar sense in the ALGOL 60 and Fortran programming language communities in the 1960s.

<text>Baron Graves, of Gravesend in the County of Londonderry, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 24 October 1794 for the naval commander Admiral Thomas Graves. He was second in command at the Battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794. His son, the second Baron, represented Okehampton, Windsor and Milborne Port. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. This line of the family failed on the death of his son, the fourth Baron, in 1904.

The fourth Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the son of the Hon. Henry Richard Graves, third son of the second Baron. On the death of his own son and only male heir, this line of the family also failed.

The sixth Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the son of Claude Thomas Graves, third son of the Hon. Henry Richard Graves, third son of the second Baron. His son, the eighth Baron, was an actor (as &quot;Peter Graves&quot;). When the eighth Baron died in 1994, this line of the family also failed.

<text>A predominance diagram purports to show the conditions of concentration and pH where a chemical species has the highest concentration in solutions in which there are multiple acid-base equilibria. The lines on a predominance diagram indicate where adjacent species have the same concentration. Either side of such a line one species or the other predominates, that is, has higher concentration relative to the other species.
To illustrate a predominance diagram, part of the one for chromate is shown at the right. pCr stands for minus the logarithm of the chromium concentration and pH stands for minus the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. There are two independent equilibria, with equilibrium constants defined as follows.
A third equilibrium constant can be derived from &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;D.
 &lt;/math&gt;|}}
The species and are only formed at very low pH so they do not appear on this diagram. Published values for log &quot;K&quot;1 and log &quot;K&quot;D are 5.89 and 2.05, respectively. Using these values and the equality conditions, the concentrations of the three species, chromate , hydrogen chromate and dichromate can be calculated, for various values of pH, by means of the equilibrium expressions. The chromium concentration is calculated as the sum of the species&#x27; concentrations in terms of chromium content.
:formula_1
The three species all have concentrations equal to at pH = p&quot;K&quot;1, for which [Cr] = . The three lines on this diagram meet at that point.
; Green line: Chromate and hydrogen chromate have equal concentrations. Setting [] equal to [] in eq. , [] = , or pH = log &quot;K&quot;1. This relationship is independent of pCr, so it requires a vertical line to be drawn on the predominance diagram.
; Red line: Hydrogen chromate and dichromate have equal concentrations. Setting [] equal to [] in Eq. , [] = ; from Eq. , then, [] = .
; Blue line: Chromate and dichromate have equal concentrations. Setting [] equal to [] in Eq. gives [] = .

The predominance diagram is interpreted as follows. The chromate ion is the predominant species in the region to the right of the green and blue lines. Above pH ~6.75 it is always the predominant species. At pH &lt; 5.89 (pH &lt; p&quot;K&quot;1) the hydrogen chromate ion is predominant in dilute solution but the dichromate ion is predominant in more concentrated solutions. 

Predominance diagrams can become very complicated when many polymeric species can be formed as, for example, with vanadate, molybdate and tungstate. Another complication is that many of the higher polymers are formed extremely slowly, such that equilibrium may not be attained even in months, leading to possible errors in the equilibrium constants and the predominance diagram.

<text>Philander Priestly Claxton (September 28, 1862 – January 12, 1957) was an American educator and administrator.

==Biography==
Philander Claxton was born in Bedford County, Tennessee. He was educated at the University of Tennessee where he obtained both his Bachelor (1882) and Masters of Arts (1887). He continued his studies at Johns Hopkins University, as well as in Germany. Claxton received an honorary Litt.D. from Bates College in 1906.

He became the superintendent of schools in North Carolina (1883–93) and subsequently he became professor of pedagogy and German at the North Carolina State Normal and Industrial College from 1893 to 1902, and in 1896 director of that institution&#x27;s Practice and Observation School. Professor Claxton was also editor of the &quot;North Carolina Journal of Education&quot; (1897-1901) and of the &quot;Atlantic Educational Journal&quot; (1901–03). He then moved back to his home state of Tennessee in 1902 to take up the post of Professor of Education at the University of Tennessee, where he taught until 1911.

Claxton was a member of the Southern Education Board, which during the early years of the twentieth century worked assiduously to promote interest in public schooling in the South. At the University of Tennessee, he organized and headed the first Department of Education and served as the superintendent (1902–11) of the Summer School of the South which, during a sixteen-year existence, improved the education of over 32,000 teachers in southern schools.

He had a distinguished career as the United States Commissioner of Education. The United States Bureau of Education became an important branch of the government as under his guidance its role and activities were substantially expanded. As Commissioner of Education under three presidents, Claxton labored through writings and addresses to raise in the public consciousness the connection between improved education and a vigorous and prosperous democracy. He also helped to write the legislation authorizing rehabilitative education for World War I veterans and developed the first plan for federal aid for vocational education.

Claxton continued in the academic education world after he retired from the Commission in 1921. He was provost of the University of Alabama until 1923 when he moved to Oklahoma to become Superintendent of Schools in Tulsa. He held that latter post from 1923 to 1929. In 1930, he returned once more to Tennessee where he again became involved in academic education as the President of the Austin Peay Normal School in Clarksville until he retired in 1946.

While his role was more directly focused on the improvement of schools at the lower levels — for which he has been hailed as the Horace Mann of the South — he exercised considerable influence on higher education. Two of his public pronouncements perhaps best sum up his concern for issues surrounding teacher education:
and
==Legacy==

The Philander P. Claxton Award was initiated by the Tennessee Conference of the American Association of University Professors in 1986 to honor an individual who had made significant contributions to higher education in Tennessee. The recipient is to embody the highest ideals of the academic profession and of the Association.

Claxton also has an elementary school named for him. P.P. Claxton elementary school in Asheville, North Carolina is named for him.

Claxton, Georgia is reputed, by some historians, to be named for Claxton.

Claxton Elementary School in Claxton, Anderson County, Tennessee in 1915 was named in his honor. Still an active school.

<text>Cygwin/X is an implementation of the X Window System that runs under Microsoft Windows. It is part of the Cygwin project, and is installed using Cygwin&#x27;s standard setup system. Cygwin/X is free software, licensed under the X11 License.

Cygwin/X was originally based on XFree86, but switched to the X.Org Server due to XFree86 licensing controversy, owing to concerns over XFree86&#x27;s new software license not being compatible with the GPL.

After a long hiatus following an 8 July 2005 release, the project was revitalised and the developers released a version based on the X.org modular 7.4 release on 12 November 2008 and continue to maintain it.

== Features ==
There are two ways to run Cygwin/X:

In one, an X server runs in a single Microsoft Windows window that serves as the X display, which holds the X root window and all the other X windows in the X session. You use an X window manager to manage the X windows within the display. You can run multiple X servers, each in its own Microsoft Windows window.

The other method is to run Cygwin/X &quot;rootless&quot;. In this method, each X window corresponds with its own Microsoft Windows window and there is no root window. There is no X window manager; Microsoft Windows&#x27; window manager moves, resizes, hides, etc. the X windows.

== Uses ==
One use for Cygwin/X is to provide a graphical interface for applications running on the same computer with Cygwin/X which are designed for the X Window System. Such an application is probably running under Cygwin.

Another use for Cygwin/X is as an X terminal: applications running on another computer access the Cygwin/X X server via the X protocol over an IP network. One can run XDM on the remote system so that a user can log into the remote computer via a window on the Cygwin/X system and then the remote system puts up web browsers, terminal windows, and the like on the Cygwin/X display.

Another common way for an application on a remote system to operate through a window on a local Cygwin/X display is SSH tunneling. An application on the local system creates an SSH session on the remote system (perhaps the application is xterm and the user types an &#x27;ssh&#x27; command). The SSH server on the remote system sets things up so that any X client program the shell starts (on the remote system) uses the local Cygwin/X server.

<text>IRCnet is currently one of the largest IRC networks. , it has around 25,000 users using it daily. An early 2005 record had approximately 123,110 users simultaneously connected to the network.

==History==

Between May and July 1996 IRCnet was formed as a European fork of EFnet, when a number of operator disagreements resulted in a group of European admins declaring their independence. The reasons for the &quot;Great Split&quot; as it came to be called, included:
* a policy disagreement about how much power system operators should have. IRCnet formed with the basis that there should be a set of rules defining what SysOps could and could not do. This viewpoint was opposed by many of the US-based EFnet servers.
* a technical disagreement on whether the network should use timestamping (TS) or Nick Delay as a means to prevent nick collisions, according to Jarkko Oikarinen.
* Vegard Engen, one of the European operators, stated that the immediate cause for the &quot;Great Split&quot; was that a major US EFnet hub had been disconnecting codice_1 without warning, and thereby breaking the link to the European servers.

== Characteristics ==
Many IRCnet servers state that &quot;IRC is a privilege, not a right&quot;. That defines the characteristics of network usage ‒ users are normally not permitted to run bots and should avoid abusive behaviour.

Servers are generally open to users from their geographic locations and do not allow outside connections, however, there are a few open exceptions allowing access to users not covered by any local server.

Strict rules are operated for shell providers regulating, limiting or banning their connections.

IRCnet operates few if any network services to service nicknames or channels. It does implement reop -channelmode that allows channel operators to set hostmasks for users to be automatically &quot;reopped&quot; by the server. This mode is called +R with capital R
and supersedes the RFC2811 +r (lower-case r) channel mode, available only on !-channels and settable (not resettable) only by their creators.

All network servers run on IRCnet&#x27;s ircd with the current version 2.11 (the latest software versions are maintained at IRC.ORG).

IRCnet&#x27;s channel operators are generally free to run their channels however they see fit without the intervention of IRC operators. IRCops are primarily there to handle network and server-related issues, and rarely get involved with channel-level issues.

To fight nickname collisions when splits occur on re-link IRCnet will use unique IDs. If there are two users with the same nickname on both sides of the network when servers are re-linking then both nicknames will be forcefully changed to unique ID instead to prevent collisions.

<text>Puppy love, also known as a crush, is an informal term for feelings of romantic love, often felt during childhood and early adolescence. It is an infatuation usually developed by someone&#x27;s looks and attractiveness at first sight. It is named for its resemblance to the adoring, worshipful affection that may be felt by a puppy. Puppy love typically lasts between 2 months and 2 years, and is thought to be fueled by adolescent hormones. Some scientists, however, think it is initiated as a result of the natural development of the brain at the onset of adolescence.

The term can be used in a derogatory fashion, presuming the affair to be shallow and in comparison to other forms of love. Sigmund Freud, however, was far from underestimating the power of early love, recognizing the validity of &quot;the proverbial durability of first loves&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Puppy love is a common experience in the process of maturing. The object of attachment may be a peer, but the term can also describe the fondness of a child for an adult. Most often, the object of the child&#x27;s infatuation is someone years older, like a teacher, a close friend of the family, or a celebrity, about whom the child will spend their time daydreaming or fantasizing. 

A crush is described as a coming-of-age experience where the child is given a sense of individualism because they feel intimate emotions for a person not part of their own family.

== In China ==

In 1950, China promulgated the Marriage Law, which established a new democratic marriage system of monogamy with freedom and equality as the core concept. Among other things, the Marriage Law stipulated that &quot;a man may marry at the age of 20 and a woman at the age of 18.&quot; However, since the 1960s, as China&#x27;s population growth problem became more pronounced and the years of education were extended, the concept of &quot;late marriage and late childbearing&quot; began to be commonly advocated, followed by the formation and stigmatization of the concept of &quot;early love.&quot; As late as the 1990s, China continued to crack down on &quot;early love&quot; among college students.

After the new marriage law came into effect in 1980, the legal age of marriage in China was adjusted to &quot;no earlier than 22 for men and 20 for women.&quot; The act of &quot;early love&quot; was considered contrary to the policy of the time, and was increasingly rejected by social values and equated with &quot;feudal superstition&quot; and &quot;obscenity and pornography&quot;.

In recent years, with the change of family planning policy and the gradual opening of the concept of marriage, the age range of &quot;early love&quot; is basically narrowed down to junior high and high school years. However, under the academic pressure of &quot;one exam for life&quot; and the traditional concept of marriage, schools and parents still have a negative attitude towards the phenomenon of &quot;early love&quot;, worrying that the youthful love will take up the energy of the children and have a negative impact on their studies and their health. Therefore, the current social environment is not conducive to early love. Therefore, the current social environment for the phenomenon of &quot;early love&quot; is still based on preventive measures, do not support or advocate, if it happens, the school level may intervene depending on the situation.

== Statistics ==
=== Taiwan ===
The 2022 Child Welfare League study of Taiwan students aged 11-15 showed that:
# Nearly 40% of junior high school students and over 20% of elementary school students said they wanted to fall in love now
# 32.9% of children said they had fallen in love, up significantly from 26.6% in 2014;
# 38.7% of the longest relationship lasted less than three months, 59.1% lasted less than six months, and 22.8% of the longest relationship more than one year;
# 44.5% thought that falling in love could hold hands and hug, 19.7% could kiss, and 4.2% could have sex.

=== China ===
A survey of high school students in a provincial model high school in Sichuan in 2021 showed:

# 64.9% had not been in love, 27.7% had been in love one to three times, and 6.4% had been in love four to six times;
# 10.6% were in love, and most of the students who were in love ranked higher in the most recent exam than the last one, different from most teachers&#x27; claim that most early love is detrimental to academic performance.

A survey of parents of high school students in Panyu Middle School in Guangdong in 2004 showed that:

# 23.5% of parents were firmly opposed to adolescent love, 56.6% did not support it, and 16.2% understood it;
# 13.2% of parents were firmly opposed to high school students dating the opposite sex, 33.8% did not support it, 48.6% did not care or understood it, and 11.8% agreed with it;
# 43.4% of parents thought that teenagers do not necessarily need heterosexual relationships to grow up;
# 23.4% of fathers and 12.5% of mothers will interfere and criticize their children after finding out they are in love. 

=== United States ===
Data from Add Health in the United States shows:

# About a quarter of 12-year-olds report having been in a relationship, and nearly three-quarters of 18-year-olds report having been in a relationship.
# Female, older, adolescents with step-parents are less likely to have never been in a relationship, and African-American, Asian, and low-income adolescents are more likely to have never been in a relationship, while African-American, low-income adolescents, once in a relationship, tend to skip casual dating and develop a stable relationship.
# Female, older, adolescents with step-parents were more likely to maintain a stable relationship, while Asian adolescents were less likely.
# Adolescents who were female, older, and from incomplete or low-income families were more likely to have sexual intercourse with a lover.
# Female adolescents were more likely to report having emotional intimacy, while African-American and Latino adolescents were less likely. Adolescents with more relationship experiences were significantly more likely to be alone with their lovers, to have sexual intercourse, and to report excellent emotional intimacy.

== Cultural and entertainment presentation ==
Many works of popular culture, including books, feature films, cartoons and TV dramas frequently depict underage relationships. Western films and television shows also focus on the beauty of underage relationships, which also stimulates the intrinsic motivation of the protagonists to strive to become better for each other, and even achieve a two-way relationship that promotes and supports each other.

Mainland Chinese film and television productions tend to avoid underage relationships, but not completely, and occasionally they end in sadness, thus &quot;conveying to the teenage audience the value of staying away from early love&quot;. For example, in 2002, when the Japanese animation Chibi Maruko-Chan first aired on Chinese television, the episode related to the emotional development of the male and female protagonists in their early teens did not air in China. Furthermore, the male protagonist&#x27;s final confession was altered from &quot;I like you&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought you were nice&quot;. Underage relationships are often the result of long periods of time together and slow accumulation of feelings in mainland Chinese films and television productions, and are often presented as a distraction from important matters and detrimental to the protagonist&#x27;s life, in which the parents are treated like enemies and the protagonist often gives in and gives up in the face of external obstacles.

In mainland China, the current General Rules for the Production of TV Series Content, issued in late 2015, the current General Rules for Content Review of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, issued in 2017, and the current Rules for Content Review Standards for Internet Short Video, issued in 2019, all refer to &quot;early love among minors&quot; as &quot;bad behavior&quot;, &quot;adverse effects on minors&quot; or &quot;detrimental to the healthy growth of minors&quot;, stating that &quot;content showing minors in early love&quot; The content of the &quot;expression of early love&quot; &quot;shall not appear.&quot; The current regulation, &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Programs for Minors,&quot; published by order of the General Administration of Radio, Film and Television in 2019, also states that &quot;programs for minors shall not&quot; &quot;affirm or approve of early romance among minors.&quot;

<text>The following is a list of Australian divisions in World War II, including all divisions raised within the Australian Army during World War II. A total of 15 such formations were established by the army during the war; of these, four infantry divisions served as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, along with one armoured division. Two other armoured divisions were formed as part of the Militia, as well as eight other infantry divisions. The 2nd AIF formations provided the bulk of Australia&#x27;s deployed forces, while many of the Militia formations were employed mainly for home defence and many were only partially formed before being broken up without seeing combat. Nevertheless, two Militia divisions were deployed as formed units, and elements of several others also fought overseas during the war.

===Second Australian Imperial Force===
A total of five divisions were raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), and this formed the bulk of Australia&#x27;s deployed ground force during the war. Of these, the four infantry divisions – the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th – were the only 2nd AIF divisions to be fully formed and see active service. The 6th went into action first, fighting its first battle at Bardia in January 1941, and it was subsequently joined in the Middle East by the 7th and 9th Divisions, who fought several campaigns in North Africa, Greece, Syria and Lebanon. While the 8th Division was largely decimated in early 1942 during fighting against the Japanese in Malaya and then taken into captivity in Singapore, and in the islands to Australia&#x27;s north, the other three infantry divisions fought throughout the war, eventually returning from the Middle East and fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific during the New Guinea and Borneo Campaigns. Initially, it had been planned to deploy the tank-equipped 1st Armoured Division to the Middle East also, but concerns about a Japanese invasion meant that they were retained in Australia for continental defence. Elements of the division did eventually see action in the Pacific against the Japanese, but only after being transferred from the division to other formations such as the 4th Armoured Brigade. Late in the war it was planned to form another infantry division within the 2nd AIF as Australia&#x27;s contribution to the proposed invasion of Japan. This formation was to be designated the 10th Division – which previously existed briefly as a Militia formation in 1942 – and was to be formed using volunteers from the three remaining 2nd AIF infantry divisions, which would have been broken up, but the war ended before the division was re-established.

===Militia===

Another 10 divisions were raised or maintained as part of the Militia. This force, also known as the Australian Military Forces, consisted of a mixture of volunteers and conscripted personnel who, by Commonwealth of Australia Defence legislation, could only be deployed for active service within Australia and Australian territories. Of these 10 divisions, eight – the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th, 11th and 12th – were predominantly infantry formations, and two were armoured divisions that included tank equipped regiments as well as motorised units and armoured cars. These were the 2nd Armoured and 3rd Armoured Divisions, which had been raised from two previously existing cavalry divisions that had been formed during the inter-war years. The Militia formations were mainly employed in Australia as garrison forces to respond in the event of an invasion, and as the war progressed and the threat of Japanese invasion passed many were only partially formed and or broken up without having seen combat. Both of the armoured divisions were disbanded without serving overseas and of the eight infantry divisions, only two – the 3rd and 5th Divisions – saw active service in their entirety, fighting in the New Guinea, Bougainville and New Britain campaigns between 1943 and 1945. Elements of some other Militia divisions also served overseas, although these divisions were never fully formed. The 11th Division was one such example, with various elements seeing action in New Guinea during the Finisterre Range campaign and on New Britain.

<text>Greenlaw is a town and civil parish situated in the foothills of the Lammermuir Hills on Blackadder Water at the junction of the A697 and the A6105 in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland. At the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 661.

==History==

Greenlaw was first made the county town of Berwickshire in 1596. At that time, Greenlaw was situated about south of the present village, atop a hill - the &#x27;Green Law&#x27;. This area is now known as Old Greenlaw.
In 1661, county town status was lost to Duns by an act of Parliament, the Duns Act 1661 (c. 136). When Patrick, Earl of Marchmont attained the barony of Greenlaw in the 1670s, he made it his business to restore what he saw as the rights and privileges that came with the barony. In 1696 he succeeded: an act of Parliament, the (c. 16), was passed, laying down in statute that the town of Greenlaw should be the Head Burgh of Berwickshire.

However, attempts were made in 1739, 1790 and 1810 to take the rights and privileges from Greenlaw and make Duns the county town once more. Though unsuccessful in their primary aim, the grounds were laid for the Berwickshire Courts Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 27), which authorising sheriff and commissary courts to be held at Duns. Another courthouse, known as County Buildings, was subsequently built at 8 Newtown Street in Duns in 1856. When Berwickshire County Council was created it held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at County Hall in Greenlaw, when it decided by 18 votes to 12 that all subsequent meetings should be held at Duns. Greenlaw was still considered the official county town after 1890, despite the county council meeting in Duns and courts being held at both towns. The Berwickshire County Town Act 1903 (3 Edw. 7. c. 5) finally revoked Greenlaw&#x27;s status as county town and declared Duns to be the county town for all purposes.

There is also a fine church, built in 1675, on earlier foundations. The corbie step gables preserve a feature of the architecture of that period. The church was expanded during the eighteenth century and completed in its present form around 1855.

After Greenlaw became a county town in 1696, the church tower was planned as a tolbooth or prison and was completed by 1712. Its style was adapted to present the appearance of a Church Tower. It is unique in structure – square rising to a height of and ending in a corballed parapet from which an steeple rises. The old iron gate or yett is the original one of 1712. A Court House also completed in 1712 stood on the west side of the tower, therefore by 1712 there stood by the side of the Church, a Tolbooth and Court House, hence the rhyme:

&quot;Here stands the Gospel and the Law, Wi&#x27; Hell&#x27;s Hole atween the twa&quot;

A new jail was built in the town in 1824. This was used throughout the Victorian period but was taken out of use in the 20th century and demolished in the 1960s.

Greenlaw Town Hall, completed in 1831, is a listed building from its county town era and was one of the buildings shortlisted in the 2006 BBC television series &quot;Restoration Village&quot;.

Greenlaw Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared in the mid-1920s. The club disappeared some time in the 1950s.

==Facilities==
Shops include the Blackadder Mini-market, Romanes pharmacy, Waldie&#x27;s butchers and the Village Store. The Post Office closed in 2010 and Greenlaw is now served by a mobile post office. There was a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, but this closed in 2014.

Since 1992 the village has been home to &#x27;STOPS&#x27;, the Scottish Theatre Organ Preservation Society, which Charitable Trust created its base in a custom converted building now known as the New Palace Theatre Organ Heritage Centre, in the 75 seat multi-purpose auditorium of which is housed the world famous Hilsdon organ from the Edinburgh Playhouse as well as the Hilsdon organs of the Palace Picture House, Edinburgh and the Picture House, Paisley. The Centre draws visitors to Greenlaw from all over the world and the resident organist of the Centre, Larry McGuire, was one of the two people ultimately responsible for saving the Edinburgh Playhouse from demolition in 1975.

An amateur Weather Centre was established at the Centre in 2006, the data from which was launched as bordersweather.co.uk, which website was initially conceived to give travellers to the Centre an idea of what weather to expect during their visit. The website has grown and is now a respected member of a nationwide chain of independent weather stations and its webcam is viewed by thousands daily during periods of snow.

The web designer of the site also established the Interactive Independent Climate Change Project which records data from a number of amateur Weather Stations around the UK, some of whom have data going back for over 25 years.

Greenlaw Castle was a manor house located to the east of the town. It was owned by a branch of the Home family, including the surgeon Robert Boyne Home (1713–1786), father of Sir Everard Home and Anne Hunter. It ceased to be used as a laird&#x27;s house in 1729, and was demolished around 1820.

==Geography==
Places nearby include Eccles, Legerwood, Gordon, Westruther, Polwarth, Fogo, Leitholm and Duns.

===Climate===
Greenlaw has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). There is a Met Office weather station located at RAF Charterhall, to the east.

<doc id="481348" wikidata="Q243912" url="?curid=481348" title="555 (telephone number)">
<text>The telephone number prefix 555 is a central office code in the North American Numbering Plan, used as the leading part of a group of 10,000 telephone numbers, &quot;555-...&quot;, in each numbering plan area (NPA) (area code). It has traditionally been used only for the provision of directory assistance, when dialing NPA-555-1212.

*555 is used in New Zealand as a free mobile telephone number to report road incidents.

The central office code is also used for fictitious telephone numbers in North American television shows, films, video games, and other media in order to prevent practical jokers and curious callers from bothering telephone subscribers and organizations by calling telephone numbers they see in works of fiction.

==Usage==

=== North America ===
In 1994, the North American Numbering Plan Administration began accepting applications for nationwide 555-numbers (outside the fictitious 555-01XX range). A number could be reserved for a single area code, for a region, or for nationwide service. In theory, a consumer from any area code could be invited to dial a seven-digit number such as 555-TAXI and the owners of that number could connect the call to a local car service. According to a 2003 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, the desired functionality requires the cooperation of local phone authorities, and most phone companies have been reluctant to cooperate. In May 2016, the Industry Numbering Committee (INC) determined that the purpose for which this resource was intended had been accommodated by other information/communication technologies. As of September 2016, all 555 numbers have been returned to the NANPA inventory except 555-1212 (national use directory assistance) and 555-4334 (national use assigned).

In 1996, Canadian telephone companies began promoting 555-1313 as &quot;name that number&quot;, a pay-per-use reverse lookup which would give a subscriber name if the user entered an area code and a listed telephone number. The fifty-cent information number was initially heavily advertised in area codes 604 (BCTel), 416 (Bell Canada), 506 (NBTel), 902 (Maritime T&amp;T) and 709 (Newfoundland Tel), but was soon forgotten once Internet sites began providing free reverse lookup tools.

Use of 555 for anything other than 555-1212 style information numbers raises the problem that call cost is unclear to consumers; in theory, the numbers could be anything from toll-free to premium. This complicates the provision of toll restriction to local subscribers.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand the number *555 is a free mobile telephone number to report a road incident or an unsafe driver. The number goes to the New Zealand Police Communication Centre, but is given a lower priority than a 111 emergency call (111 is an analogue of 911 in North America). When you call the police communicator will ask you, where you are, how long ago the incident happened, the vehicle licence plate and what is happening now. The information will be passed along to frontline police, but will often only result in a warning letter. Police still urge drives to call 111 for more serious instances such as a serious motor vehicle crash or any instances where life is at risk.

== Fictional usage ==

Telephone companies began encouraging the producers of television shows and movies to use the 555 prefix for fictional telephone numbers by the 1960s. Two early examples include &quot;The Second Time Around&quot; (1961), which used 555-3485, and &quot;Panic in Year Zero!&quot; (1962), which used 555-2106. In television shows made or set in the mid-1970s or earlier, &quot;KLondike 5&quot; or &quot;KLamath 5&quot; reflects the old convention of using telephone exchange names.

Before &quot;555&quot; or &quot;KLondike-5&quot; gained broad usage, scriptwriters would sometimes invent fake exchanges starting with words like &quot;QUincy&quot; or &quot;ZEbra&quot;, as the letters &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; were not used on the old dial phones. Numbers in the format &quot;Zenith&quot; X-..., while not directly dialable, were not fictional. These were an early form of regional tollfree number which required operator assistance.

Only 555-0100 through 555-0199 are now specifically reserved for fictional use; the other numbers have been reserved for actual assignment.

555 use is restricted only in North America. In 1994, cartoonist Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; included a panel with graffiti of a 555 number by which prank calls could be made to Satan. In Australia, 555 was at the time a standard exchange, and the Australian owner of the number became the subject of harassment, launching an unsuccessful lawsuit against Larson and his syndicate for defamation.

The 555 exchange is not reserved in area codes used for toll-free phone numbers. This led to the video game &quot;The Last of Us&quot; accidentally including the number to a phone-sex operator.

The number &quot;555-2368&quot; (or 311-555-2368) is a carryover from the &quot;EXchange 2368&quot; (&quot;Exchange CENTral&quot;) number common in telephone advertisements as early as the 1940s. &quot;555-2368&quot; is the phone number used by Jim Rockford in the TV series &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (as seen during the opening credits), in the TV series &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (episode: &quot;And a Little Child Shall Bleed Them&quot;) and the Ghostbusters (as seen during their TV commercial within the film).

555 numbers are mentioned directly in the 1993 action film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny Madigan (played by Austin O&#x27;Brien) tries to convince Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character that he is inside a movie by pointing out the 555 exchange provides at most 9,999 available telephone numbers, insufficient for all the phone users in Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character replies, &quot;That&#x27;s why we have area codes&quot;, and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s character drops the subject.

The use of 555 numbers helps to avoid use of valid numbers in works of fiction or entertainment, which can lead people to call those numbers and bother their holders. Tommy Tutone&#x27;s song &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot; and the cinematic release of &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; displaying 776-2323 as a number to call God both led to misdialed calls in multiple area codes. God&#x27;s number was changed to 555-0123 in the video release of the movie. In cities where it became popular, the 1966 song &quot;634-5789&quot; by Wilson Pickett and others caused many unwanted calls to actual subscribers who knew nothing about the song; many had to change their numbers. &quot;777-9311&quot; by The Time used Dez Dickerson&#x27;s actual telephone number at the time the song was written, causing his phone to ring incessantly until he had his number changed. The Alicia Keys song &quot;Diary&quot; contains a real number in New York&#x27;s area code 347, an overlay, but does not indicate an area code; the same number in some other area code is a common misdial.

The prefix has also seen use in journalism &quot;about&quot; phone numbers, as in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s A-HED feature on the nomenclature of nominal degrees of intimacy: They&#x27;re Dating, but He&#x27;s Still Just 212-555-1234 in Her Contact List.

<doc id="481359" wikidata="Q4862291" url="?curid=481359" title="Baron Crofton">
<text>Baron Crofton is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1797 (as Baroness Crofton) for Dame Anne Crofton. She was the widow of Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet, of the Mote, who had represented Roscommon in the Irish House of Commons and had been offered a peerage just before his death. The peerage was instead bestowed upon his widow. She was succeeded by her grandson, the second Baron, who had already succeeded as fourth Baronet. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1840 to 1869 and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the three Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby and in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s first government. His son, the third Baron, served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1873 and 1912 and was also State Steward to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His nephew, the fourth Baron, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1916 to 1942. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2007.

The Crofton Baronetcy, of the Mote, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1758 for Marcus Crofton, who was a Member of the Irish House of Commons. Born Marcus Lowther, he was the husband of Catherine Crofton, daughter of Sir Edward Crofton, 3rd Baronet, of the Mote (a title which became extinct in 1780; see Crofton baronets (1661 creation)). Lowther assumed the surname of Crofton. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned second Baronet, whose wife was elevated to the peerage in 1797. On his death, the baronetcy passed to his son, the third Baronet, and then to the latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Baronet, who in 1817 succeeded his grandmother as second Baron Crofton.

The family seat was Mote House, near Ballymurray, County Roscommon.

<doc id="481366" wikidata="Q269221" url="?curid=481366" title="Eleanor of Viseu">
<text>Eleanor of Viseu ( ; 2 May 1458 – 17 November 1525) was a Portuguese &quot;infanta&quot; (princess) and later queen consort of Portugal. She is considered one of her country&#x27;s most notable queens consort and one of the only two who were not foreigners. To distinguish her from other infantas of the same name, she is commonly known as Eleanor of Viseu (after her father&#x27;s title) or Eleanor of Lancaster (&quot;Lancaster&quot;, a name used by some Portuguese royals after her great-grandmother Queen Philippa of Lancaster). In Portugal, she is known universally as &quot;Rainha Dona Leonor&quot;.

==Early life and background==
Eleanor was the eldest daughter of Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and his wife Beatrice of Portugal. Both of her parents were grandchildren of John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster.

Little is known about Eleanor&#x27;s early life. Her education and upbringing were likely guided by the writings of her grandfather Edward I of Portugal.

===Marriage ===

On 22 January 1471, twelve year old Eleanor married the fifteen year old John, Prince of Portugal, son of her uncle Afonso V and his wife Isabella of Coimbra and the heir apparent to the throne of Portugal. Around the same time, Eleanor&#x27;s sister Isabel of Viseu married Fernando II of Braganza, head of the most powerful noble house in Portugal.

In May 1475, while her husband and father-in-law were invading Castile, Eleanor gave birth to her only child to survive infancy, Afonso. John returned home sometime after but left again in January 1476, appointing Eleanor regent of the kingdom. 

==Queen consort==
Upon the death of Afonso V on 28 August 1481 John ascended the throne as King of Portugal with Eleanor as his queen consort. The queens consort of Portugal were awarded fiefs and villages to grant them independent incomes, and Eleanor was granted Silves e Faro and Terras de Aldeia Galega e Aldeia Gavinha for this purpose.

From the onset of his reign, John II focused heavily on diminishing the powers of the most powerful noble houses in the kingdom, namely the House of Beja and Viseu and the House of Braganza. His aggressive centralization policies impacted some of Eleanor&#x27;s closest relatives. In 1483, John accused the Queen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Fernando II of Braganza, of treason and had him executed. Later, in 1484, the Queen&#x27;s brother Diogo, Duke of Viseu was accused of leading a conspiracy against the crown and was stabbed to death in 1484 by the king himself. 

Eleanor is credited as the founder of Caldas da Rainha. In 1484, at the site of water that healed of her of an unknown affliction while traveling from Óbidos to Batalha, the queen ordered a hospital built so that others could enjoy the same relief. Construction began the following year, and although the first patients were admitted in 1488, the works were not completed until about 1496 or 1497. To finance the hospital and its adjoining church, the queen sold her jewels and used income from her landholdings. The name of the settlement that grew around the site and became Caldas da Rainha refers to both its founder and the reason for its existence. The city&#x27;s name can be translated as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hot Springs&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Spa&quot;, or &quot;Queen&#x27;s Baths&quot;.

Eleanor and John II&#x27;s only child, Afonso, died in a horse accident in 1491, leaving the succession uncertain. John wanted his illegitimate son Jorge to succeed him but Eleanor was intent on securing succession for her younger brother Manuel. Following bitter disputes with Eleanor and a failed petition to Rome to have Jorge legitimized, John finally recognized Manuel as his heir in his will a few weeks before his death.

==Queen dowager==

After her brother Manuel I succeeded to the throne in 1495, Eleanor moved to the palace of Xabregas, where she hosted the royal court and continued to be socially active. For a short period between 1500 and 1502, Eleanor&#x27;s brother Manuel found himself childless, and Eleanor herself became the heir to the throne. As she had no children, she declined to make the oath as an heir in favour of her sister Isabel.

Eleanor was extremely wealthy and used much of her money for charity. In 1498, she spearheaded the creation of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia as confraternities with humanitarian purposes, especially the care of the poor and the sick. The original foundations survive today, and more have since been founded in other towns and cities of Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies.

Eleanor is also credited with having introduced the printing press to Portugal, when she commissioned a translation of &quot;Vita Christi&quot; into Portuguese. When the first of its four volumes were published in 1502, it became the first book to be printed in Alcalá de Henares.

Eleanor supported the foundation of the Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos (All Saints&#x27; Royal Hospital) in Lisbon, considered the best in contemporary Europe. She also founded the convent Madre de Deus (1509), considered a great architectural work, where she spent many of her later years, dressed almost as a nun.

<text>USS &quot;Claxton&quot; (DD-140), named for Thomas Claxton, was a in the United States Navy. Entering service in 1919, the destroyer saw intermittent use during the interwar period. During World War II, &quot;Claxton&quot; was transferred to the Royal Navy and renamed HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot;. The ship saw service in the Battle of the Atlantic before sold for scrapping in 1944.

== Construction and career ==
===United States Navy service (1919–1940)===
The ship was launched on 14 January 1919 by Mare Island Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. F. W. Kellogg. &quot;Claxton&quot; commissioned on 13 September 1919.

&quot;Claxton&quot; operated on the west coast until 18 June 1922, when she was decommissioned at San Diego, California. Re-commissioned 22 January 1930, she served on the west coast and on reserve training from New Orleans until September 1933, when she joined the Special Service Squadron for patrol duty off Cuba. Between January and November 1934 she was in rotating reserve at Charleston, then returned to Cuban patrols until October 1935. After exercising with the Battle Force, she was assigned to the Naval Academy during 1936 and 1937, making three coastal cruises.

Duty with Squadron 40-T, formed to patrol European waters protecting American interests during the civil war in Spain, occupied &quot;Claxton&quot; from October 1937 until November 1938. In January 1939 she returned to duty at the Naval Academy, but in September began service on the Neutrality Patrol off the Florida Straits. In January and February 1940, she patrolled off the New England coast, and after training cruises on the east coast, arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, 21 November 1940. On 26 November she was delivered to British authorities in the destroyers-for-bases exchange. She was decommissioned 5 December 1940, and commissioned in the Royal Navy the same day as HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot;.

=== Service with the Royal Navy (1940–1944)===

HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot;, as a , arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, 30 December 1940 for duty with the Western Approaches Command escorting Atlantic convoys. In April and May 1942, she joined in escorting the US aircraft carrier on her two voyages to fly planes off for beleaguered Malta. Returning to the Clyde, HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. &quot;Salisbury&quot; guarded troop convoys in the Atlantic until September, when she was assigned to the Royal Canadian Navy. Based at St. John&#x27;s, HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot; served on local escort duty until November 1943 when, with newer escorts available, she was placed in care and maintenance status at Halifax, Nova Scotia and paid off on 10 December 1943. She was sold for scrap 26 June 1944 at Vancouver, British Columbia.

<text>Baron Carew is a title that has been created three times. The first creation was in the Peerage of England in 1605. The first recipient, Sir George Carew (1555–1629), was later made Earl of Totnes in 1626. Both titles became extinct on his death as he left no heirs.

The next two creations were in favour of the same person, Robert Shapland Carew (1787–1856), who had previously represented County Wexford in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Wexford. In 1834 he was created Baron Carew in the Peerage of Ireland and in 1838 he was made Baron Carew, of Castle Boro in the County of Wexford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His eldest son, the second Baron, sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for County Waterford and was Lord Lieutenant of County Wexford.

On the death of his younger son, the fourth Baron, this line of the family failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Shapland Francis Carew, younger son of the first Baron. His son, the sixth Baron, assumed in 1938 by deed poll the additional surname of Conolly, which was that of his maternal grandfather. The seventh Baron was a distinguished equestrian, who represented Ireland in the Olympic Games. the titles are held by his son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in that year.

Between 1956 and 1965 the sixth Baron was the owner of Castletown House and Estate in County Kildare, regarded as one of Ireland&#x27;s finest country houses and now a museum open to the public and in the ownership of the Irish State.

The original family seat was Woodstown House in County Waterford, but is now Donadea House, near Naas, County Kildare.

<doc id="481377" wikidata="Q1375137" url="?curid=481377" title="Elamo-Dravidian languages">
<text>The Elamo-Dravidian language family is a hypothesised language family that links the Elamite language of ancient Elam (present-day southwestern Iran, and southeastern Iraq) to the Dravidian languages of South Asia. The latest version (2015) of the hypothesis entails a reclassification of Brahui as being more closely related to Elamite than to the remaining Dravidian languages. Linguist David McAlpin has been a chief proponent of the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis, followed by Franklin Southworth as the other major supporter. The hypothesis has gained attention in academic circles, but has been subject to serious criticism by linguists, and remains only one of several possible scenarios for the origins of the Dravidian languages. Elamite is generally accepted by scholars to be a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language.

==History of the proposal==
The concept that Elamite and Dravidian are in some way related dates from the beginnings of both fields in the early nineteenth century. Edwin Norris was the first to publish an article in support of the hypothesis in 1853. Further evidence was proposed by Robert Caldwell when he published a comparative linguistics book in 1856 about the Dravidian languages. David McAlpin, assistant professor of Dravidian languages and linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, published a series of papers providing evidence supporting the theory. He also speculated that the Harappan language (the language of the Indus Valley civilization) might also have been part of this family.

==Linguistic arguments==
According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to present day Pakistan by immigration from the Middle East via Elam, located in present-day southwestern Iran. McAlpin (1975) in his study identified some similarities between Elamite and Dravidian. He proposed that 20% of Dravidian and Elamite vocabulary are cognates while 12% are probable cognates. He further claimed that Elamite and Dravidian possess similar second-person pronouns and parallel case endings. They have a number of similar derivatives, abstract nouns, and the same verb stem+tense marker+personal ending structure. Both have two positive tenses, a &quot;past&quot; and a &quot;non-past&quot;.

==Reception==
The hypothesis has gained attention in academic circles but is difficult to assess due to the limited resources on the Elamite language. Supporters of the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis include Igor M. Diakonoff and Franklin Southworth.

Bhadriraju Krishnamurti regarded McAlpin&#x27;s proposed morphological correspondences between Elamite and Dravidian to be &quot;ad hoc&quot;, and found them to be lacking phonological motivation. Similar criticisms have been made by Kamil Zvelebil and others. Georgiy Starostin criticized them as no closer than correspondences with other nearby language families. For the majority of historical linguists, the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis remains unproven, and Elamite is generally accepted by scholars to be a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language.

==Spread of farming==
Apart from the linguistic similarities, the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis rests on the claim that agriculture spread from the Near East to the Indus Valley region via Elam. This would suggest that agriculturalists brought a new language as well as farming from Elam. Supporting ethno-botanical data include the Near Eastern origin and name of wheat (D. Fuller). Later evidence of extensive trade between Elam and the Indus Valley Civilization suggests ongoing links between the two regions.

Renfrew and Cavalli-Sforza have also argued that Proto-Dravidian was brought to the Indus Valley by farmers from the Fertile Crescent, but more recently Heggarty and Renfrew noted that &quot;McAlpin&#x27;s analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy&quot;, adding that Fuller finds no relation of Dravidian languages with other languages, and thus assumes it to be native to India. Renfrew and Bahn conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data, and that &quot;the linguistic jury is still very much out&quot;.

Narasimhan et al. (2019) conclude that the Iranian ancestral component in the IVC people was contributed by people related to but distinct from Iranian agriculturalists, lacking the Anatolian farmer-related ancestry which was common in Iranian farmers after 6000 BCE. Those Iranian farmers-related people may have arrived in India before the advent of farming in northern India, and mixed with people related to Indian hunter-gatherers to 3700 BCE, before the advent of the mature IVC. Sylvester et al. (2019) noted that (referring to Renfrew (1996)) &quot;the existence of Brahui speakers, solitary Dravidian language speakers in Balochistan in Pakistan, supports the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis&quot;, and concluded that bidirectional migration and admixture occurred during neolithic times.

<doc id="481379" wikidata="Q1463546" url="?curid=481379" title="USS Claxton (DD-571)">
<text>USS &quot;Claxton&quot; (DD-571), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Thomas Claxton, born in Baltimore, Maryland.

&quot;Claxton&quot; was launched 1 April 1942 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. A. D. Bernhard; and commissioned 8 December 1942, Commander Herald F. Stout in command.

==History==
In March 1943 &quot;Claxton&quot; patrolled briefly in Casco Bay, Maine, awaiting the possible sortie of German battleship from Norwegian waters. After one convoy escort assignment to Casablanca, she sailed from Charleston, South Carolina, 17 May to join the Pacific Fleet.

After training at Nouméa and Espiritu Santo from 12 June 1943, &quot;Claxton&quot; covered the landings at Rendova between 27 June and 25 July, then joined Destroyer Squadron 23 for a period of operations which were recognized with the Presidential Unit Citation. In the struggle for the Solomons, &quot;Claxton&quot; and her squadron patrolled to intercept enemy shipping, protected the passage of American troops and shipping, bombarded enemy bases, covered landings, and engaged Japanese surface and air forces.

In the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on the night of 1/2 November 1943, &quot;Claxton&quot;, with four cruisers and seven other destroyers, fired her torpedoes in an attack which turned back a Japanese force of four cruisers and six destroyers sailing to attack transports off Bougainville, sinking two and damaging four of the enemy ships. &quot;Claxton&quot; towed , one of five American ships damaged that night, into Purvis Bay, arriving 4 November.

On 25 November 1943, in the battle of Cape St. George, New Ireland, &quot;Claxton&quot; and four other destroyers intercepted a force of five Japanese destroyers, as the enemy ships sailed to evacuate aviation troops to Rabaul. Once more fighting in darkness, &quot;Claxton&quot; and the others achieved complete surprise in their torpedo attack, and followed with a running gun battle. In this classic destroyer action, three Japanese ships were sunk and a fourth damaged, with no injury to the American ships.

On 4 February 1944, while bombarding Sarime Plantation on Bougainville, &quot;Claxton&quot; was seriously damaged by an explosion aft, probably of two medium caliber shells. Despite her damage and 15 wounded, &quot;Claxton&quot; completed her mission with her three forward guns, then sailed for temporary aid at Purvis Bay and permanent repairs on the west coast. She returned to action in August 1944, and assigned to screen escort carriers, took part in the invasion of the Palaus in September. Sailing north for the invasion of the Philippines, the destroyer covered the operations of underwater demolition teams preparing the beaches, then gave screening and fire support during the landings on 20 October. In the phase of the Battle for Leyte Gulf known as the Battle of Surigao Strait on 24 and 25 October, &quot;Claxton&quot; screened the battle line in the surface action which virtually destroyed the Japanese southern force.

Continuing her patrol in Leyte Gulf to support the forces ashore, on 1 November 1944, &quot;Claxton&quot; suffered 5 dead, 23 wounded, and serious damage when a Japanese suicide plane crashed and exploded in the water alongside to starboard. The men used their mattresses to fill the hole. With all her after living spaces flooded, &quot;Claxton&quot; fought her own damage as she rescued 187 survivors of , also a &quot;kamikaze&quot;″s victim.

Repairs at Tacloban and Manus prepared &quot;Claxton&quot; for her return to action on fire support, patrol, and escort duty in the Lingayen Gulf landings from 9–18 January 1945. Continuing action in the Philippines, she conducted bombardments and covered landings, at various points on Luzon and Mindanao and in the Visayas through early May. On 16 May she arrived off Okinawa for duty as radar picket and fighter-director until the close of the war. On 6 June her guns drove off a flight of 12 &quot;kamikazes&quot;.

==Fate==
Sailing from Okinawa 10 September 1945, &quot;Claxton&quot; reached Washington, D.C., 17 October for the ceremonial presentation of the Presidential Unit Citation 2 days later. After overhaul in New York, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Charleston, South Carolina, 18 April 1946. On 15 December 1959, she was loaned under the Mutual Assistance Program to the Federal Republic of Germany, with whom she served as &quot;Zerstörer 4&quot; (D 178). In February 1981, she was transferred to the Hellenic Navy where she was ultimately dismantled for spare parts.

==Honors==
In addition to her squadron&#x27;s Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Claxton&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<text>North York is a former township and city and is now one of the six administrative districts of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the northern area of Toronto, centred around Yonge Street, north of Ontario Highway 401. It is bounded by York Region to the north at Steeles Avenue, (where it borders Vaughan) on the west by the Humber River, on the east by Victoria Park Avenue. Its southern boundary is erratic and corresponds to the northern boundaries of the former municipalities of Toronto: York, Old Toronto and East York. As of the 2016 Census, the district has a population of 644,685.

North York was created as a township in 1922 out of the northern part of the former township of York, a municipality that was located along the western border of the-then City of Toronto. Following its inclusion in Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, it was one of the fastest-growing parts of Greater Toronto due to its proximity to Toronto. It was declared a borough in 1967, and later became a city in 1979, attracting high-density residences, rapid transit, and a number of corporate headquarters in North York City Centre, its planned central business district. In 1998, North York was dissolved as part of the amalgamation which created the new City of Toronto. It has since been a secondary economic hub of the city outside Downtown Toronto.

== History ==

The was formed on June 13, 1922 out of the rural part of the Township of York. In the previous decade, the southern part of York, bordering the old City of Toronto had become increasingly urbanized while the northern portion remained rural farmland. The northern residents increasingly resented that they made up 20% of York&#x27;s tax base while receiving few services and little representation in return, particularly after 1920 when their sole member on York&#x27;s council, which was elected on an at-large basis, was defeated. Dairy farmer Robert Franklin Hicks organized with other farmers to petition the Ontario legislature to carve out what was then the portion of York Township north of Eglinton Avenue to create the separate township of North York. With the support of the pro-farmer United Farmers of Ontario government, a plebiscite was organized and held and the 6,000 residents voted in favour of separating from York by margin of 393 votes.

The township remained largely rural and agrarian until World War II. After the war, in the late 1940s and 1950s, a housing shortage led to the township becoming increasingly developed as a suburb of Toronto and a population boom. In 1953, the province federated 11 townships and villages with the Old City of Toronto, to become Metropolitan Toronto.

North York used to be known as a regional agricultural hub composed of scattered villages. The area boomed following World War II, and by the 1950s and 1960s, it resembled many other sprawling North American suburbs.

As North York became more populous, it became the in 1967, and then on February 14, 1979, the . To commemorate receiving its city charter on Valentine&#x27;s Day, the city&#x27;s corporate slogan was &quot;The City with Heart&quot;.

North York was amalgamated into Toronto on January 1, 1998. It now forms the largest part of the area served by the &quot;North York Community Council&quot;, a committee of Toronto City Council.

===Incidents===
On August 10, 2008, a massive propane explosion occurred at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases propane facility just southwest of the Downsview Airport. This destroyed the depot and damaged several homes nearby. About 13,000 residents were evacuated for several days before being allowed back home. One employee at the company was killed in the blast and one firefighter died while attending to the scene of the accident. A follow-up investigation to the incident made several recommendations concerning propane supply depots. It asked for a review of setback distances between depots and nearby residential areas but did not call for restrictions on where they can be located.

Canada&#x27;s deadliest pedestrian attack occurred in the North York City Centre district on April 23, 2018 when a van collided with numerous pedestrians killing 10 and injuring 16 others on Yonge Street between Finch and Sheppard Avenues.

==Education==

Prior to 1998, the North York Board of Education and Conseil des écoles françaises de la communauté urbaine de Toronto operated English and French public secular schools in North York, while the Metropolitan Separate School Board operated English and French public separate schools for North York pupils. Today, four public school boards operate primary and secondary institutions in the former city:

* Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM)
* Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV)

The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first language separate schools, the latter operating English first language separate schools. All four public school boards are headquartered within North York.
In addition to primary and secondary schools, several post-secondary institutions were established in North York. York University is a university that was established in 1959. The university operates two campuses in North York, the Keele campus located in the north, and Glendon College, a bilingual campus operated by the university.

The former three controlled access highways are operated by the province as 400-series highways, whereas the latter two roadways are managed by the City of Toronto. The section of Highway 401 which traverses North York is the busiest section of freeway in North America, exceeding 400,000 vehicles per day, and one of the widest.

Public transportation in North York is primarily provided by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) bus or subway system.

<text>Resignation is the formal act of relinquishing or vacating one&#x27;s office or position. A resignation can occur when a person holding a position gained by election or appointment steps down, but leaving a position upon the expiration of a term, or choosing not to seek an additional term, is not considered resignation.

When an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination. Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible. Abdication is the equivalent of resignation for a reigning monarch, pope, or holder of another similar position.

==Political examples==

A resignation is a personal decision to exit a position, though outside pressure exists in many cases. For example, Richard Nixon resigned from the office of President of the United States in August 1974 following the Watergate scandal, when he was almost certain to have been impeached by the United States Congress.

===Deliberate manoeuvre===
Resignation can be used as a political manoeuvre, as in the Philippines in July 2005, when ten cabinet officials resigned en masse to pressure President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to follow suit over allegations of electoral fraud. Arroyo&#x27;s predecessor, Joseph Estrada, was successfully forced out of office during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 as he faced the first impeachment trial held in the country&#x27;s history.

In 1995, the British Prime Minister, John Major, resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party in order to contest a leadership election with the aim of silencing his critics within the party and reasserting his authority. Having resigned, he stood again and was re-elected. He continued to serve as prime minister until he was defeated in the 1997 elections.

However, ascertaining whether an employee had an intent to resign depends on all the circumstances. As noted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, an employee&#x27;s storming off may not legally be a resignation.

===When criticised===
Although government officials may tender their resignations, they are not always accepted. This could be a gesture of confidence in the official, as with US President George W. Bush&#x27;s refusal of his Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s twice-offered resignation during the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.

However, refusing a resignation can be a method of severe censure if it is followed by dismissal; Alberto Fujimori attempted to resign as President of Peru, but his resignation was refused so that Congress could impeach him.

==Delivery==
For many public figures, primarily departing politicians, resignation is an opportunity to deliver a valedictory resignation speech in which they can elucidate the circumstances of their exit from office and in many cases deliver a powerful speech which often commands much attention. This can be used to great political effect, particularly as, subsequent to resigning, government ministers are no longer bound by collective responsibility and can speak with greater freedom about current issues.

&quot;Spending more time with family&quot; is a common reason credited during public resignations, especially as a euphemism when receding from scandal.

==Other organisations==
In academia, a university president or the editor of a scientific journal may also resign, particularly in cases where an idea which runs counter to the mainstream is being promoted. In 2006, Harvard president Lawrence Summers resigned after making the provocative suggestion that the underrepresentation of female academics in math and science could be due to factors other than sheer discrimination, such as personal inclination or innate ability.

In a club, society, or other voluntary association, a member may resign from an officer position in that organization or even from the organization itself. In Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, this is called a request to be excused from a duty. A resignation may also be withdrawn.

<doc id="481393" wikidata="Q1460497" url="?curid=481393" title="Quercus michauxii">
<text>Quercus michauxii, the swamp chestnut oak, is a species of oak in the white oak section &quot;Quercus&quot; section &quot;Quercus&quot; in the beech family. It is native to bottomlands and wetlands in the southeastern and midwestern United States, in coastal states from New Jersey to Texas, inland primarily in the Mississippi–Ohio Valley as far as Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.

==Description==
The leaves of the swamp chestnut oak are simple (not compound), long and broad, with 15–20 lobe-like, rounded simple teeth on each side, similar to those of chestnut oak and chinkapin oak (&quot;Quercus muehlenbergii&quot;), although they generally do not achieve the more slender form that the leaves of those trees may exhibit at times. The leaves turn red in autumn. The fruit is an acorn long and broad, borne on a 2–3 cm peduncle, maturing in the fall, about 6 months after pollination. The tree only bears heavy acorn crops at intervals of several years.

== Taxonomy ==
The swamp chestnut oak closely resembles the chestnut oak (&quot;Quercus montana&quot;), and for that reason has sometimes been treated as a variety of that species. However, the swamp chestnut oak is a larger tree which differs in preferred habitat, and the bark does not have the distinctive deep, rugged ridging of the chestnut oak, being thinner, scaly, and paler gray. It typically grows to around 65 ft (20 m) tall, though the tallest specimen currently known is over 150 ft (42 m) tall.

The name &quot;Q. prinus&quot; was long used by many botanists and foresters for the swamp chestnut oak, even when treated as a species distinct from the chestnut oak, which was then called &quot;Q. montana&quot;, but the application of the name &quot;Q. prinus&quot; to the chestnut oak is now often accepted, although sometimes that name is declared to be of uncertain position, unassignable to either species, with the chestnut oak then called &quot;Q. montana&quot;, as in the &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

== Ecology ==
The acorns of the swamp chestnut oak are eaten by generalist species like chipmunks, squirrels, white-tail deer, wild hogs, and black bears. They are also readily eaten by cattle, and the species is sometimes called the &quot;cow oak&quot; for this reason.

== Uses ==
The wood of the swamp chestnut oak is similar to, and usually marketed mixed with, that of other white oaks. Swamp chestnut oak is also called basket oak, since the wood is easily split into long, thin, flexible strips excellent for basket weaving.
The swamp chestnut oak&#x27;s acorns are large, relatively sweet, and edible.

The swamp chestnut oak is sometimes cultivated as a large garden tree or street tree, and is quite easy to grow if it is not subject to extreme urban conditions. The current National Champion Swamp Chestnut Oak is in the Stumpy Lake area in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It is high, with a crown of and a circumference of .

<doc id="481398" wikidata="Q131397" url="?curid=481398" title="Venus of Willendorf">
<text>The Venus of Willendorf is an Venus figurine estimated to have been made years ago. It was recovered on 7 August 1908 from an archaeological dig conducted by Josef Szombathy, Hugo Obermaier, and Josef Bayer at a Paleolithic site near Willendorf, a village in Lower Austria. The figurine was found by a workman named either Johann Veran or Josef Veram and is carved from an oolitic limestone that is not local to the area, and tinted with red ochre. It is in the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Austria .

==Dating==
The figure is associated with the Upper Paleolithic Gravettian industry, which dates to between 33,000 and 20,000 years ago. The figure itself is estimated to have been left in the ground around 30,000 years ago, based on radiocarbon dates from the layers surrounding it.

==Interpretation and purpose==

Similar sculptures, first discovered in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are traditionally referred to in archaeology as &quot;Venus figurines&quot;, due to the widely held belief that depictions of nude women with exaggerated sexual features represented an early fertility deity, perhaps a mother goddess. The reference to Venus is metaphorical, since the figurines predate the mythological figure of Venus by many thousands of years. Some scholars reject this terminology, instead referring to the statuette as the &quot;Woman of&quot; or &quot;Woman from Willendorf&quot;.
Very little is known about the &quot;Venus&quot;″ origin, method of creation, or cultural significance; however, it is one of numerous &quot;Venus figurines&quot; surviving from Paleolithic Europe. The purpose of the carving is the subject of much speculation. Like other similar sculptures, it probably never had feet, and would not have stood on its own, although it might have been pegged into soft ground. Parts of the body associated with fertility and childbearing have been emphasized, leading some researchers to believe that the Venus of Willendorf and similar figurines may have been used as fertility goddesses. The figure has no visible face, her head being covered with circular horizontal bands of what might be rows of plaited hair, or perhaps a type of headdress.

Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott hypothesize that the figurines may have been created as self-portraits by women. This theory stems from the correlation of the proportions of the statues to how the proportions of women&#x27;s bodies would seem if they were looking down at themselves, which would have been the only way to view their bodies during this period. They speculate that the complete lack of facial features could be accounted for by the fact that sculptors did not own mirrors. This reasoning has been criticized by University of California anthropologist Michael S. Bisson, who notes that water pools and puddles would have been readily available natural mirrors for Paleolithic humans.

==Stone&#x27;s source==
Research published in 2022 indicates that the closest and most likely source of the oolite used is on the other side of the Alps in northern Italy, near Lake Garda. A lesser possibility is that it came from a site in eastern Ukraine some away. While the former has the highest statistical probability, the latter is closer to sites in southern Russia where similarly styled figurines have been found. In either case, this raises questions regarding the mobility of ancient populations.

<doc id="481400" wikidata="Q3586698" url="?curid=481400" title="Elections in Fiji">
<text>Since becoming independent of the United Kingdom in 1970, Fiji has had four constitutions, and the voting system has changed accordingly.

==Suffrage and representation==
The Legislative Council elected in 1963 had 37 members. There were 12 elected members, four from each of the Fijian, Indian and European groups chosen on a communal franchise. The Governor also nominated two from each of the communities. There were to be 19 official members. The Legislative Councillors of each race were permitted to select two from their fellows to the Executive Council. Qualifications to register as a voter were as follows: 
# British subject
# Age of 21 years or over
# Resident in the colony for a period of, or periods amounting in the aggregate of, not less than twelve months out of the preceding three years.
# Ability to read and write a simple sentence and sign one’s name in the English language in the case of a European, in either English or Fijian in the case of a Fijian, and for an Indian either in English, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Gurmukhi, Gujarati or Malayalam. &quot;European&quot; and &quot;Indian&quot; were defined as a person whose father or any of whose male progenitors in the male line was a European or Indian, respectively, while a &quot;Fijian&quot; was defined as &quot;a person whose father or any of whose progenitors in the male line ... was an aboriginal native of the colony, excluding the island of Rotuma and its dependencies.&quot;
These definitions firstly disallowed an illiterate adult to vote, secondly permitted some people to choose between ethnic rolls and thirdly made no provision for Rotumans, non-Fijian Pacific Islanders and Chinese to vote.

The Legislative Council elected in 1966 had 36 members. Twenty-five seats represented &quot;communal constituencies&quot; (nine indigenous Fijians, nine Indians, and seven General Electors (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities), elected on closed electoral rolls by voters registered as members of their respective ethnic groups. A further nine members were elected from &quot;national constituencies&quot; – seats allocated ethnically (three for each ethnic constituency) but elected by universal suffrage. The remaining two members were nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs.

* From 1972 through 1987, the House of Representatives had 52 members. Of these, 22 were allocated to indigenous Fijians and another 22 to Indo-Fijians; a further eight were allocated to General Electors (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities). Of the 22 seats allocated each to indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, 12 were elected from &quot;Communal constituencies&quot; and 10 from &quot;National constituencies&quot;. Of the eight seats allocated to General Electors, three were elected from a communal roll and 5 from national constituencies. All members represented single-member constituencies, and were elected by the First past the post system. In the same period, the newly established Senate had 22 members (eight nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs (of whom any three held the power of veto over changes to the country&#x27;s land laws), seven by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, and one by the Council of Rotuma).
* In 1992 and 1994, the House of Representatives had 70 members. Thirty-seven seats were allocated to indigenous Fijians, 27 to Indo-Fijians, one to Rotuman Islanders, and 5 to General Electors. All were elected from communal rolls; that is, all members were elected only by voters registered as belonging to their own ethnic group. The &quot;First past the post&quot; system remained in effect. The Senate in this time had 34 members (24 nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 by the Council of Rotuma; a further 9 were appointed by the President to represent non-indigenous Fijians).
* From 1999 onwards, the House of Representatives had 71 members. Twenty-five represented &quot;open electorates;&quot; these members were elected by universal suffrage and could belong to any race. The remaining 46 seats were communal, with 23 being allocated to indigenous Fijians, 19 to Indo-Fijians, one to Rotuman Islanders, and three to General Electors. Instant run-off voting was adopted for these elections. The Senate had 32 members (14 nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs, nine by the Prime Minister, eight by the Leader of the Opposition, and one by the Council of Rotuma).

<doc id="481424" wikidata="Q2753951" url="?curid=481424" title="Fiji mermaid">
<text>The Fiji mermaid (also Feejee mermaid) was an object composed of the torso and head of a juvenile monkey sewn to the back half of a fish. It was a common feature of sideshows where it was presented as the mummified body of a creature that was supposedly half mammal and half fish, a version of a mermaid. The original had fish scales with animal hair superimposed on its body and pendulous breasts on its chest. The mouth was wide open with its teeth bared. The right hand was against the right cheek, and the left tucked under its lower left jaw. This mermaid was supposedly caught near the Fiji Islands in the South Pacific. Several replicas and variations have also been made and exhibited under similar names and pretexts. P. T. Barnum exhibited the original in Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York in 1842, but it then disappeared—likely destroyed in one of the many fires that destroyed parts of Barnum&#x27;s collections.

==History==
Barnum, in his autobiography, described the mermaid as &quot;an ugly dried-up, black-looking diminutive specimen, about 3 feet long. Its mouth was open, its tail turned over, and its arms thrown up, giving it the appearance of having died in great agony,&quot; a significant departure from traditional depictions of mermaids as attractive creatures.

American sea captain Samuel Barrett Edes bought Barnum&#x27;s &quot;mermaid&quot; from Japanese sailors in 1822 for $6,000, using money from the ship&#x27;s expense account. Another account says that a captain of an American whaler bought it for $5,000 in Batavia, Dutch Indonesia.

Either way, the mermaid is believed to be one of many being manufactured commercially in Japan, by fishermen with a sense of humor as well as profit-mindedness. It was possibly a composite of a &quot;blue-faced monkey and a salmon&quot; in this case.

A Dutchman who was posted as warehouse keeper on Dejima, Nagasaki 1820–1829 writes that such a mermaid could be obtained for a handy price and resold for a fortune in Dutch Indonesia. According to J. F. van Overmeer Fisscher, the object from the Japanese workshop merely cost 30 &quot;ryō&quot; or 60 guilders, but might be sold for 2000 in Batavia. When he showed interest in this speculative profiteering, all sorts of samples were shown him: a two-headed men, face-on-belly, devil-headed people, twin-headed dragons, etc., some of which wound up as part of his cabinet collection in The Hague.

The mermaid was displayed in London in 1822, advertised in a publication by J. Limbird in the &quot;Mirror&quot;, and displayed the Turf Coffee-house, St. James&#x27;s Street. An etching of it was made by artist George Cruikshank in 1822.

Captain Edes&#x27; son took possession of the mermaid and sold it to Moses Kimball of the Boston Museum in 1842, and he brought it to New York City that summer to show it to P. T. Barnum. Barnum had a naturalist examine it who would not attest to its authenticity. Nevertheless, Barnum believed that the relic would draw the public to the museum. Kimball remained the creature&#x27;s sole owner, while Barnum leased it for $12.50 a week. Barnum generated publicity for the object by having an agent send anonymous letters to New York newspapers from Montgomery, Alabama, and Charleston, South Carolina, contending that &quot;Dr. J. Griffin&quot; had an object which he had caught in South America. Griffin was actually being impersonated by Levi Lyman, one of Barnum&#x27;s associates. To keep the plan working, Griffin checked in to a Philadelphia hotel, then showed the mermaid to the landlord as a thanks for his hospitality. The landlord was so intrigued that he begged Griffin to show it to some of his friends, many of whom were editors.

Griffin traveled to New York and displayed it to a small audience, then displayed it as the Fiji Mermaid in the concert hall for a week. It was actually only displayed for five days because Barnum had &quot;convinced&quot; Griffin to bring it to the American Museum of Natural History. Barnum printed 10,000 pamphlets which described general information about mermaids and stories about his specimen in particular.

==Later incarnations==

In his &quot;Secrets of the Sideshows&quot;, Joe Nickell documents several modern-day claimants to the title of Barnum&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; original mermaid, or as he describes them, &quot;fakes of Barnum&#x27;s fake&quot;. Exhibits at &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, Coney Island&#x27;s Sideshow by the Seashore, and Bobby Reynolds&#x27; traveling sideshow all lay claim to the title, but according to Nickell&#x27;s opinion, none of them are to be believed. He also describes an update of the tradition that uses an elaborate system to project the image of a live woman into a fishbowl, giving the appearance that she is only an inch or two long. He relates the story of a performer who was smoking a cigarette in her hidden chamber; the man outside was confronted by an angry patron who demanded to know how this was possible if the &quot;mermaid&quot; was underwater.

A guide to constructing a Fiji mermaid appeared in the November 2009 issue of &quot;Fortean Times&quot; magazine, in an article written by special effects expert and stop-motion animator Alan Friswell. Rather than building the figure with fish and monkey parts, Friswell used papier mache and modelling putty, sealed with wallpaper paste, and with doll&#x27;s hair glued to the scalp.

Lijiang is famous for its UNESCO Heritage Site, the Old Town of Lijiang, which contains a mixture of different historical architecture styles and a complex, ancient water-supply system. and borders Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Panzhihua City in Sichuan Province to the east. It has one municipality and four counties.

Lijiang City is located in Yungui Plateau and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is one of the key forest areas in Yunnan Province and one of the west and east power transmission bases of China&#x27;s hydropower industry. Lijiang City is a multi-ethnic settlement, except for the Han nationality, there are a total of 22 ethnic minorities.

Lijiang is the only prefecture-level city with three World Heritage Sites, rich in tourism resources, 104 tourist attractions, such as Lijiang Ancient City, Yulong Snow Mountain, Tiger Leaping Gorge, Laojun Mountain, and Shuhe Ancient Town.

==History==
As far back as 100,000 years ago, people of the late Paleolithic were active in what is now Lijiang. The discovery of cave paintings in the Jinsha River Valley along with numerous neolithic stone tools and later artifacts of Bronze and Iron Age provenance prove Lijiang to have been one of the most important centres of ancient human activity in southwest China.

Warring States period, it belonged to the Shu Prefecture of the Qin state. At the end of the Warring States period, it was part of the territory of the Dian Kingdom.

Han Dynasty, the Dian Kingdom submitted to the Han, and today&#x27;s Lijiang City belonged to the Yuezhi Commandery, known as Suijiu County.

Three Kingdoms, it was part of the Yunnan Prefecture.

Northern and Southern Dynasties, Lijiang still belonged to the Yunnan Prefecture, known as Suijiu County, and it was aeound of the Naxi people migrated here.

Tang Dynasty was once the territory of the Yaozhou Governor&#x27;s Office, later it became part of the Tibetan Empire, and the territory of Nanzhao, known as Sangchuan, under the jurisdiction of the Jianchuan Military Commission.

The Baisha Old Town was the political, commercial and cultural center for the local Naxi people and other ethnic groups for 450 years from the year 658 AD to 1107AD. The Dabaoji Palace of the Baisha Fresco, very close to the Baisha Naxi Hand-made Embroidery Institute, was built in the year 658 AD in the Tang dynasty (618 AD to 907 AD).

In ancient times, the Baisha Old Town used to be the center of silk embroidery in the southwest of China and the most important place of the Ancient Southern Silk Road, also called the Ancient Tea and Horse Road or Ancient tea route. The Ancient Southern Silk Road started from Burma, crossed Lijiang, Shangri-La County, Tibet, continued through Iran, the Fertile Crescent before finally reaching the Mediterranean Sea.

The Kingdom of Lijiang submitted to Khubilai Khan as he led his troops against the Dali kingdom in 1253. Though the kingdom was incorporated into the Mongol empire then the Yuan dynasty, it was given the status of &quot;tusi&quot;, or indigenous office, which gave autonomy to the local Naxi rulers. During the Ming dynasty, the Naxi were one of the few border peoples to support the Ming immediately. As the Naxi helped the Ming expand in Southwest China the ruler family was given the title of Mu. During this period the Kingdom of Lijiang was able to expand into Sichuan and Tibet bringing many Tibetan peoples into its territory as well as their cultural and religious influence. It was under the rule of the Naxi ruling house of the Mu family () during the Yuan (not yet named Mu), Ming, and Qing dynasties. The Mu &quot;held this position until 1723, when Lijiang became directly incorporated under the authority of the Qing central government.&quot;

15th year of the Ming Dynasty&#x27;s Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign (1382), A Jia A De, the local chief of Lijiang, &quot;led the people to submit,&quot; and the Lijiang Lu XuanfuSi (Lijiang Road&#x27;s pacification commissioner&#x27;s office) was restrustured into the Lijiang Prefecture. By the 30th year of the Hongwu Emperor (1397), it was promoted to the Lijiang Junmin Fu (Lijiang Military and Civil Administration), which governed over four states, one county, and one patrol inspection office: Tong&#x27;an State, Baoshan State, Ju Jin State, Lin Xi county, and Shimen pass patrol Inspection office.

In the 17th year of the Qing Dynasty&#x27;s Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign(1660), the Lijiang JunminFu was established again, with the Mu family continuing to hold the hereditary position of the chief. In the first year of the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s reign(1723), the implemented the &quot;reform of the native chieftain system&quot; in Lijiang, replacing the hereditary chief with an appointed official from the court, and demoting the Mu family to the position of the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign(1770), Lijiang County was established.

In the second year of the Republic of China (1912), the Lijiang Prefecture was abolished, retaining only the county, and the county government moved into the former Lijiang Prefecture&#x27;s office building.

In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), three counties were established within the current area of Lijiang: Lijiang, Yongbei, and Huaping.

In 2002 Lijiang City was established, replacing the former Lijiang Naxi Autonomous County.

== Geography ==

Lijiang is located in the northwestern portion of Yunnan and borders Sichuan. It is within the region encompassed by the Hengduan Mountains, where the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau converge. It borders Sichuan Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Panzhihua City to the east, and Jianchuan, Heqing and Binchuan three of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in the south. County and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture Dayao and Yongren counties, west and north are adjacent to Lanping County of Nujiang Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Weixi County of Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The city has a total area of 20,600 square kilometers and governs the ancient city, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County, Yongsheng County, Huaping County and Ninglang Yi Autonomous County.

Lijiang City has a terrain that is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast. The highest point is the main peak of Yulong Snow Mountain, with an elevation of 5,596 meters, and the lowest point is at the mouth of the Tangba River in Shilongba Township, Huaping County, with an elevation of 1,015 meters, resulting in a maximum elevation difference of 4,581 meters. To the west of Yulong Mountain lies the high mountain and gorge sub-region of the Hengduan Mountain Range, characterized by high mountains and deep valleys, with steep and towering mountain ranges and rivers cutting deeply through them. To the east of Yulong Mountain is part of the Dianxi Basin&#x27;s mountainous plateau region, specifically the northwestern sub-region of the Dian Plateau, which has a higher elevation and more robust mountainous terrain. On both sides of the main mountain range, there are also extensive east–west oriented valleys, creating a complex and intricate landscape of landforms with undulating terrain and a significant difference in elevation. There are 111 large and small basins scattered among the mountain ranges, generally at an elevation of over 2,000 meters, with the Lijiang Basin being the largest, covering an area of about 200 square kilometers and an average elevation of 2,466 meters.

The Jinsha River, which flows through Lijiang City, along with the three major mountain ranges that rise abruptly on both sides—the Yunling Mountains&#x27; Laojun Mountain, Yulong Mountain, and Mianmian Mountain (commonly known as Xiao Liangshan), form the basic framework and backbone of the topography of Lijiang City. Laojun Mountain stretches like a barrier from north to south on the west side, with its main peak reaching an elevation of 4,247.4 meters. Yulong Snow Mountain, which is located 15 kilometers from the seat of the city government of Lijiang, features high mountain glacier landforms and is covered with snow all year round. Its 13 peaks are connected end to end, pointing towards the sky. To the east lies Mianmian Mountain. There are 12 high mountains in Lijiang City with an elevation ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 meters. Middle mountains with an elevation between 2,500 and 3,500 meters are distributed across all counties. The areas of Ninglang and Yongsheng have a particularly high number of these mountains, and low mountainous areas below 2,500 meters are widely distributed in the southeastern and southern parts of the city.

Among them, Chenghai is located in Yongsheng County and is one of the three lakes in the world that are rich in natural spirulina. It is also the only lake in China where spirulina can grow naturally. It covers an area of 77.2 square kilometers, with a water storage capacity of 1.987 billion cubic meters, an average water depth of 25.74 meters, and is the fourth largest lake in Yunnan Province.

<text>Adiantum (), the maidenhair fern (not to be confused with the similar-looking maidenhair spleenwort fern), is a genus of about 250 species of ferns in the subfamily Vittarioideae of the family Pteridaceae, though some researchers place it in its own family, Adiantaceae. The genus name comes from Greek, meaning &quot;unwetted&quot;, referring to the fronds&#x27; ability to shed water without becoming wet.

==Description==
They are distinctive in appearance, with dark, often black stipes and rachises, and bright green, often delicately cut leaf tissue. The sori are borne submarginally, and are covered by reflexed flaps of leaf tissue which resemble indusia. Dimorphism between sterile and fertile fronds is generally subtle.

They generally prefer humus-rich, moist, well-drained sites, ranging from bottomland soils to vertical rock walls. Many species are especially known for growing on rock walls around waterfalls and water seepage areas.

The highest species diversity is in the Andes. Fairly high diversity also occurs in eastern Asia, with nearly 40 species in China.

Species native to North America include &quot;A. pedatum&quot; (five-fingered fern) and the closely related &quot;A. aleuticum&quot;, which are distinctive in having a bifurcating frond that radiates pinnae on one side only. The cosmopolitan &quot;A. capillus-veneris&quot; (Venus-hair fern) has a native distribution that extends into the eastern continent. &quot;A. jordanii&quot; (California Maidenhair) is native to the west coast.

There is a rich &quot;Adiantum&quot; flora in New Zealand with 3 endemic species (&quot;A. cunninghamii&quot;, &quot;A. viridescens&quot; and &quot;A. fulvum&quot;) in a total of 10 recorded species. Many of these are common especially in the west and south of the islands.

==Cultivation==
Many species are grown in the horticultural trade. There are a number of tropical species, including &quot;A. raddianum&quot; and &quot;A. peruvianum&quot;. Both &quot;A. pedatum&quot; and &quot;A. aleuticum&quot; are hardy to zone 3, and are by far the most cold-hardy members of the genus. &quot;A. venustum&quot; is also cold-hardy to zone 5. &quot;A. capillus-veneris&quot; is hardy to zone 7. Hybrids, such as &quot;Adiantum × mairisii&quot;, are also popular.

<text>Kelis Rogers (; born August 21, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter and chef. She attended New York&#x27;s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, where she played saxophone and was selected for the Girls Choir of Harlem. Upon graduation, Rogers landed a role as a backing vocalist for the hip hop group Gravediggaz. She then began working with music producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo—collectively known as the Neptunes—who led her to sign with Virgin Records in 1998.

Rogers&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1999), was inspired by jazz and disco music from the 1970s. Despite critical acclaim, the album was met with domestic commercial failure; it instead found moderate success on international charts. Supported by her first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 entry with its lead single &quot;Caught Out There&quot;, the album peaked at number 43 on the UK Albums Chart and earned gold certification by the country&#x27;s British Phonographic Industry (BPI). She parted ways with Virgin Records after her second album, &quot;Wanderland&quot; (2001) also received poor sales—not seeing a domestic release until 2019. After signing with the Neptunes&#x27; Star Trak Entertainment, Rogers third studio album, &quot;Tasty&quot; (2003), served as her commercial breakthrough and was met with continued critical praise. Its lead single, &quot;Milkshake&quot;, peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; the song and its follow-up, &quot;Trick Me&quot;, both peaked at number two on the UK singles chart. Her fourth album, &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; (2006)—preceded by the US top 20 single &quot;Bossy&quot; (featuring Too Short)—peaked number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Following its release, she took a hiatus from recording and ventured into culinary arts at Le Cordon Bleu.

She later signed with will.i.am Music Group to release her fifth album, &quot;Flesh Tone&quot; (2010), which explored electronic music. Two of its singles, &quot;Acapella&quot; and &quot;4th of July (Fireworks)&quot; found success on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and the UK Dance Singles Chart. Tying-in with her culinary career, she released her sixth studio album &quot;Food&quot; (2014), which became her second top-20 album in the UK and spawned three singles: &quot;Jerk Ribs&quot;, &quot;Rumble&quot; and &quot;Friday Fish Fry&quot;. The album explored a neo soul recording style.

Rogers has been recognized at the Brit Awards, Q Awards, NME Awards, and Grammy Awards. Her musical output as a lead and featured artist encompasses various genres. She has collaborated with R&amp;B and hip hop acts including Nas (whom she married in 2003), Busta Rhymes, Outkast, and Puff Daddy; electronic and dance producers such as Calvin Harris, Disclosure, Giorgio Moroder, Timo Maas, and Richard X; pop and rock acts Enrique Iglesias, Duran Duran, and No Doubt; and indie and alternative musicians including Björk and Dave Sitek. She has sold 6 million records worldwide and has had particular success in the United Kingdom, where ten of her singles have peaked within the top ten of the UK singles chart.

==Early life==
Rogers was born and raised in the Frederick Douglass Houses in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. Her first name is a portmanteau of her father&#x27;s name, Kenneth (1944–2000), and her mother&#x27;s name, Eveliss. Her father Kenneth was an African-American jazz musician and Pentecostal minister and was formerly a professor at Wesleyan University. Her mother Eveliss is a Chinese-Puerto Rican fashion designer who inspired Rogers to pursue her singing career. She has three sisters, two older and one younger.

As a child, Rogers sang in church choirs and played violin, piano, and saxophone while attending Manhattan Country School, a private school. At 13, she shaved off all of her hair. In an interview, Rogers says she was kicked out of her parents&#x27; house at 16 for bad behavior, stating that she would sometimes clash with her mother, but continued her education at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, where she formed the R&amp;B trio BLU (Black Ladies United). She was also a bartender and a sales associate at a clothing store before graduating high school.

==Career==
===1997–2002: &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;Wanderland&quot;===
In 1997, Kelis provided background vocals on &quot;Fairytalez&quot;, a track on hip hop group Gravediggaz&#x27;s album &quot;The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel&quot;. Afterward, a friend introduced Kelis to The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo); they formed a strong bond, and with their support she landed a record deal with Virgin Records. According to Kelis, Virgin Records advised her that publishing royalties would be split evenly among Williams, Hugo, and herself; however, Kelis made no money from sales of her first two albums on the label. Kelis has said that Williams was credited as a songwriter on songs of hers that he had not written.

Kelis began recording her debut album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; in mid-1998 and was finished within a year. Produced by The Neptunes and released by Virgin Records in 1999, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; peaked at number 144 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart. As of 2006, the album has sold 249,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Its lead and most notable single &quot;Caught Out There&quot; became a top 10 Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs hit and peaked at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. During this time, Kelis featured on Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s U.S. top 40 single &quot;Got Your Money&quot;.

The album performed better in Europe, where &quot;Caught Out There&quot; was a moderate hit in most European countries except the United Kingdom, where the song saw massive success, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. The single &quot;Good Stuff&quot; (featuring Pusha T of Clipse) reached number 19; another single &quot;Get Along with You&quot; was less successful, reaching number 51. The British Phonographic Industry certified &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; gold for sales of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart.

In 2001, Kelis won the Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act and the &quot;NME&quot; Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Act, then joined Moby and U2 on the Area:One and Elevation tours, respectively. Kelis and the Neptunes&#x27; output at this time was heralded as foreshadowing an innovation in contemporary R&amp;B, but she later said &quot;I was never an R&amp;B artist. People coined me one but that&#x27;s because, especially if you&#x27;re in the States, if you&#x27;re black and you sing, then you&#x27;re R&amp;B&quot;. Her colorful style in both clothing and hair received considerable attention.

Kelis&#x27;s second album &quot;Wanderland&quot; was released in 2001 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America but did not receive a North American release until 2019. According to Kelis, Virgin Records, her U.S. record company at the time, had laid off those that worked on &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;; their replacements did not understand or believe in &quot;Wanderland&quot;. Eventually, Kelis was dropped from Virgin around the time of the album&#x27;s European release, but she remained on the label&#x27;s roster in Europe. A commercial failure, &quot;Wanderland&quot; peaked at number 78 in the UK; its only single &quot;Young, Fresh n&#x27; New&quot; managed to crack the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart. The album, which was produced in its entirety by the Neptunes and features collaborations with members of Clipse and No Doubt, received a subdued critical response. &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;In our collective fantasies, Kelis Rogers is already the ghetto-fabulous sex-queen of discodelic future-funk pop-rock-soul...But beyond the initial shopping-and-funking dazzle, there is way too much filler here for a hotly hyped alterna-soul princess with her eyes on the big prize&quot;. &quot;The Fader&quot; later referred to &quot;Wanderland&quot; as &quot;Kelis&#x27;s long lost masterpiece&quot;.

In 2002, Kelis recorded &quot;So Be It&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s Fela Kuti tribute CD &quot;Red Hot and Riot&quot;, from which all proceeds were donated to AIDS-awareness charities. The same year, she had a top 20 U.S. club hit with a remix of &quot;Young, Fresh &#x27;n&#x27; New&quot;, produced by Timo Maas, who featured Kelis on his single &quot;Help Me&quot;. She hosted the DanceStar USA Awards ceremony at that year&#x27;s Winter Music Conference.

===2003–2005: &quot;Tasty&quot;===
In 2003, Kelis achieved a second top 10 hit in the UK as a featured artist on Richard X&#x27;s &quot;Finest Dreams&quot;, a reworking of the S.O.S. Band&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;The Finest&quot;, and a European club hit (and UK top 40 single) as a featured artist on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ill&quot; by P. Diddy, her manager for a brief period. She found mainstream success in the U.S. later in 2003 with her Hot Dance Club Play number one, &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top three single &quot;Milkshake&quot;; this single helped to propel her third album &quot;Tasty&quot; to gold status in the U.S., where it peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold 533,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Milkshake&quot; also went gold, selling over 500,000 copies, and earned Kelis a Grammy Award nomination in 2004 for Best Urban/Alternative Performance.

Although the Neptunes contributed several tracks to &quot;Tasty&quot;—the album was released by their label Star Trak Entertainment, a joint venture with Arista Records—Kelis also collaborated with other producers such as Dallas Austin, André 3000, Rockwilder, and Raphael Saadiq. She stated in an interview: &quot;I felt like I had a lot to prove with this album. People had started messing with me along the lines of &#x27;Is she REALLY any good without The Neptunes?&#x27; — which I knew was ridiculous. And so I was like &#x27;I&#x27;ll take that challenge&#x27;.&quot; The album was well-received critically; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Tasty&quot; is &quot;Kelis&#x27; past—big beats, out-there imagery, and sex appeal—refined...much of the beauty of &quot;Tasty&quot; is in witnessing Kelis rise to the challenge of working with multiple imaginative maestros.&quot;

&quot;Milkshake&quot; and &quot;Tasty&quot; immediately found success in Europe. According to the BPI, &quot;Tasty&quot; went platinum in the United Kingdom, selling over 300,000 copies, and &quot;Milkshake&quot; went silver, selling over 200,000 units. The Dallas Austin-produced &quot;Trick Me&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, went to the top 10 in many European countries during mid-2004; it did not, however, garner success in the U.S. in the absence of promotion by Jive Records, the label Kelis had been transferred to after Arista Records folded at the time of &quot;Tasty&quot;″s release. Kelis&#x27; success grew in Australia, where &quot;Tasty&quot; went gold and where &quot;Milkshake&quot; and &quot;Trick Me&quot; went platinum. Kelis followed the success of the third &quot;Tasty&quot; single, the BPI silver-certified &quot;Millionaire&quot; (featuring André 3000), with the Rockwilder-produced track &quot;In Public&quot; (featuring Nas), which reached number 17 on the UK chart.

&quot;Not in Love&quot;, Kelis&#x27;s collaboration with Enrique Iglesias from his 2003 album &quot;7&quot;, was released as a single the following year, reaching the UK top five. Although the single failed to chart on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it topped the country&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Play chart. Also in 2004, Kelis collaborated with Björk on a remix of the latter&#x27;s track &quot;Oceania&quot; (from Björk&#x27;s album &quot;Medúlla&quot;), which appeared as a B-side to the single &quot;Who Is It&quot;. Kelis toured as the opening act for fellow Jive artist Britney Spears&#x27;s The Onyx Hotel Tour, then headlined her own tour of Australia and New Zealand. In 2005, she was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; with a cover version of The Pretenders&#x27; &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot;===
Kelis contributed a track titled &quot;80&#x27;s Joint&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2006 dance film &quot;Step Up&quot;. She collaborated with Busta Rhymes and will.i.am on the track &quot;I Love My Bitch&quot;, the second single from Rhymes&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;The Big Bang&quot;. This was the second time Kelis collaborated with Rhymes, the first being his 2001 song &quot;What It Is&quot;.
&quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; was released in 2006, and it debuted and peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Despite the career-high debut, the album has sold only 157,000 copies in the United States as of 2007, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In the UK, &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; charted at number 41 and has sold 60,000 copies, earning a silver certification from the BPI. The album was Kelis&#x27;s first not to feature contributions from The Neptunes, as she had left Star Trak by this time; instead, she recorded with Cee-Lo Green, Max Martin, Raphael Saadiq, Scott Storch, and will.i.ams. According to Kelis, she received no support from Jive Records for the recording or promotion of &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; and argued heavily with the label, later describing the period as &quot;[not] the most creative atmosphere&quot; and &quot;the only time where I felt like I was being pulled in different directions. There were too many cooks in the kitchen&quot;. MTV characterised critical consensus of the album as &quot;intriguingly intelligent, if unjustifiably disjointed and long&quot; and wrote in 2016 that &quot;it remains her most creatively anarchic project&quot;. &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; was nominated for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album at the 2007 Grammy Awards.

&quot;Bossy&quot; (featuring Too Short), &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot;″s lead single, was a moderate hit in the U.S., peaking at number 16; it additionally went multi-platinum as a mobile phone ringtone, according to the RIAA. The single &quot;Blindfold Me&quot; (featuring Nas) reached number 91 on the R&amp;B chart and did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Kelis&#x27;s European label, Virgin, instead released the Cee-Lo-featuring &quot;Lil Star&quot;, which was another top 10 hit for Kelis in the United Kingdom (peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart). During mid 2007, Kelis toured in Europe, appearing in numerous festivals across the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, such as Wireless, Rise and Gurtenfestival. Ford chose Kelis to help advertise the 2007 Ford Edge, and she recorded a theme song for the commercial, titled &quot;Push It to the Edge&quot;, with help from producer Scott Storch.

Jive Records dropped Kelis in late 2007. Her manager at the time said that the singer was working with Cee-Lo Green on an alternative dance album and would be shopping a pop album produced by songwriter Guy Chambers. Scottish electronica producer Calvin Harris was said to be collaborating with her. Kelis took a hiatus from music: &quot;I was like &#x27;I will never put out another record again, I hate this business, I hate all these people.&#x27; I was in this race that I didn&#x27;t even realise that I was in. I woke up and ten years had passed. That was never my plan&quot;.

After Kelis left Jive, the label released a 14-track greatest hits album titled &quot;The Hits&quot; in 2008. The album does not contain any previously unreleased songs; Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s &quot;Got Your Money&quot;, N.E.R.D&#x27;s &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, and Richard X&#x27;s &quot;Finest Dreams&quot; appear on the album with every charted Kelis single to that date, with the exception of &quot;Blindfold Me&quot;. Also in 2008, the &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; album track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Think So&quot; became a top 40 hit in Australia after being used in promotion for the 2008 season of the reality series &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot;.

===2009–2011: &quot;Flesh Tone&quot;===
In 2009, Kelis signed to Interscope Records via the will.i.am Music Group to release &quot;Flesh Tone&quot;, which included production from Ammo, Free School, Benny Benassi, Burns, Boys Noize, DJ Tocadisco, will.i.am, and David Guetta. &quot;Flesh Tone&quot; marked Kelis&#x27; transition into dance music. Kelis said she was hesitant to sign to another major label after her experiences with Jive Records but did not want the album to be &quot;swept under the rug with a smaller label&quot;. Coinciding with her change in musical direction, Kelis appeared on Basement Jaxx&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Scars&quot; on the title track, on Benassi&#x27;s 2010 single &quot;Spaceship&quot; (with apl.de.ap and Jean Baptiste)—a top 40 U.S. and UK club hit—and on the Crookers single &quot;No Security&quot; from their debut album &quot;Tons of Friends&quot;.

Critical reception to &quot;Flesh Tone&quot; was generally positive, with Pitchfork naming the album Kelis&#x27;s best since her debut &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;. &quot;Acapella&quot; (produced by David Guetta), the first single from &quot;Flesh Tone&quot;, debuted in the top five on the UK Singles Chart and reached number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs and the UK Dance Chart, eventually receiving a BPI silver certification. &quot;Flesh Tone&quot; peaked at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number five on the Dance/Electronic Albums. The single &quot;4th of July (Fireworks)&quot; was accompanied by a video co-directed by Kelis (with Rankin and Nicole Ehrlich) and became a top 10 club hit in America and Britain. The singles &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Brave&quot; made minimal chart impact.

During mid-2010, Kelis embarked on her first U.S. tour, titled All Hearts with Robyn, amid a selection of club, festival, and solo dates that continued through 2011 – these included Glastonbury, The Big Chill, Good Vibrations Festival, and Lovebox. Kelis appears on the Mark Ronson-produced track &quot;The Man Who Stole a Leopard&quot; from the 2010 Duran Duran album &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;, a song she and the band performed in a concert directed by filmmaker David Lynch. She co-wrote the song &quot;Waiting&quot; for British pop singer Cheryl Cole&#x27;s &quot;Messy Little Raindrops&quot;. Kelis then collaborated with Calvin Harris on the 2011 single &quot;Bounce&quot;, the lead single from Harris&#x27; album &quot;18 Months&quot;. &quot;Bounce&quot; debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Kelis&#x27;s tenth UK top 10 single and her biggest selling in the country (as of 2017). It eventually received a platinum certification from the BPI.

===2012–2017: &quot;Food&quot;===

In 2012, Kelis&#x27;s management firm at the time announced that her sixth studio album would be released in late 2012 and feature production from Skream, Burns, Tom Neville, Dan Black, and Caspa. The first single, the Skream-produced &quot;Distance&quot;, received its UK radio premiere in mid 2012. Kelis said of the album, &quot;I&#x27;ve been on a real 1990s vibe with this record, it&#x27;s kind of trip-hoppish...it&#x27;s more electro, it&#x27;s a little deeper and darker&quot;. Kelis was featured on Dan Black&#x27;s single &quot;Hearts&quot; and Skream&#x27;s &quot;Copy Cat&quot; (both 2013), the latter of which led to a dispute after Kelis alleged that Skream refused to have her appear in the music video. She opted to move on from dance music: &quot;when everyone else starts doing it, it&#x27;s not as much fun...too much time went by. That [sound] wasn&#x27;t a new idea any more&quot;. The rest of the material from these recording sessions remains unreleased.

By 2013, Kelis was working with producer Dave Sitek, and it was announced that she would release two albums via Sitek&#x27;s label Federal Prism. The single &quot;Jerk Ribs&quot; premiered online. Kelis then signed to British independent label Ninja Tune for the release of the album &quot;Food&quot; in 2014. Produced entirely by Sitek, &quot;Food&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number 20, becoming Kelis&#x27; second highest-peaking album after &quot;Tasty&quot; in 2004. In the U.S., it reached number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the top 20 on the Independent Albums. Subsequent singles were &quot;Rumble&quot; (a top 40 hit on the UK Independent Singles Chart) and &quot;Friday Fish Fry&quot;. &quot;Food&quot; received positive reviews from critics, including a five-star review in &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;Kelis&#x27;s sixth album is a moveable feast...If music be the food of love, Kelis has cooked up something tasty enough to satisfy all but the hungriest of hearts.&quot; Mic named &quot;Food&quot; the best album of 2014 and of Kelis&#x27;s career, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as one of the year&#x27;s best R&amp;B albums.

A limited edition version of &quot;Food&quot; included remixes by electronic producers such as Actress, Mount Kimbie, Ben Pearce, Breach, Machinedrum, and Will Saul. Breach reworked his remix of &quot;Rumble&quot; into &quot;The Key&quot;, a track featuring Kelis, released as a single later in 2014. Kelis&#x27; performance at London&#x27;s Somerset House was recorded and released as the album &quot;Live in London&quot; in late 2014. In 2015, Kelis featured on veteran disco producer Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, singing on the track &quot;Back and Forth&quot;. In 2017, she was featured with rapper Sage The Gemini on English house DJ TCTS&#x27; single &quot;Do It Like Me (Icy Feet)&quot; and on Dan Black&#x27;s single &quot;Farewell&quot;. Also in 2017, she released the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You&quot; (originally sung by The Miracles), on the Danger Mouse-produced compilation &quot;Resistance Radio: The Man in The High Castle&quot; for the television show &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;.

===2018–present: &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; anniversary tour and new music===
Kelis contributed vocals to the dance track &quot;My Milkshake&quot;, a rework of her 2003 single &quot;Milkshake&quot; by British producer Freejak, in 2018. Kelis embarked on the &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; 20th Anniversary Tour, a UK and European tour celebrating the 20th-anniversary release of her debut album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, in March 2020, though this was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelis was featured on a Disclosure song titled &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; in 2020 and on &quot;Deal with It&quot;, a track on &quot;Demidevil&quot;, the debut mixtape by Ashnikko, in 2021. The former single, from Disclosure&#x27;s Grammy Award-nominated album &quot;Energy&quot;, received frequent airplay on radio stations in the UK and reached the UK dance chart top 40. In October 2020, a biographical animated short about her life as a singer and chef was released on YouTube.

Kelis revealed to &quot;i-D&quot; magazine in 2019 that she was working on an EP that, at the time of the interview, was intended for release in 2020; in 2021, she said an album, &quot;Dirt&quot;, would be released in 2022. Kelis released the single &quot;Midnight Snacks&quot; in 2021 and &quot;Feed Them&quot; in 2022, the latter in collaboration with the meal delivery service Daily Harvest.

An interpolation of Kelis&#x27;s &quot;Milkshake&quot; was used in the Beyoncé song &quot;Energy&quot; on her 2022 album &quot;Renaissance&quot;. The song was updated on some streaming services to remove the interpolation after Kelis said that she was not notified nor asked for approval for the song&#x27;s use. Kelis said that Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of the Neptunes, the credited songwriters on &quot;Milkshake&quot;, had &quot;stolen&quot; and &quot;swindled&quot; her publishing rights for the song.

In February 2023, Kelis appeared on a commercial to advertise that year&#x27;s Super Bowl; the commercial also featured Diddy, Montell Jordan and Donna Lewis, among others. In March 2023, Kelis announced she would be performing on the West Holts stage at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival. That same month, she announced tour dates for a European-only tour. On June 3, 2023, Kelis performed at the &quot;Mighty Hoopla&quot; music festival in London. On September 12, 2023, Kelis released &quot;Milkshake 20&quot; (Alex Wann Remix), which she co-produced.

==Other ventures==
===Culinary===
From 2006 to 2010, Kelis trained part-time as a saucier, eventually graduating from Le Cordon Bleu. 
In 2013, Kelis debuted her sauce line, Feast, at the Beverly Hills Food &amp; Wine Festival. Kelis has described sauce as &quot;what accessories are to a woman&#x27;s outfit. Sauce defines where the dish is from and who&#x27;s making it...I think everything is better smothered, poured, or dipped.&quot; The line went on general sale in 2015 under the new name of Bounty &amp; Full. Kelis&#x27;s first cookbook, &quot;My Life on a Plate&quot;, was also released in 2015; Kelis describes it as &quot;an exploration of tastes and cultures, and my experience as a chef, musician, mother and wife&quot;. Kelis had previously written an unreleased cookbook with Lauren Pesavento in 2006.

In March 2014, Kelis set up a food truck to cook for attendees of the American music festival SXSW. She promoted her 2014 album &quot;Food&quot; by sharing her recipes for apple farro, jerk ribs, New York vanilla bean cheesecake, and more on the Spotify app Supper. That same year, the Cooking Channel aired a cooking television series starring Kelis, titled &quot;Saucy and Sweet&quot;. In 2016, Kelis and cooking duo Le Bun opened a pop-up restaurant in London that she adapted as a food truck to tour around UK music festivals. In September 2017, she released a milkshake recipe in collaboration with Baileys. In 2019, Kelis developed an exclusive menu with a local street food vendor for Jam on Rye Festival in London. She also appears in &quot;Cooked with Cannabis&quot;, a competition cooking series that Netflix launched on April 20, 2020.

===Fashion/TV===
In 2006, Kelis designed her own line of fashion accessories, titled Cake. In 2007, she was in talks to host a &quot;Project Runway&quot;-esque show for VH1 and auditioned for various film and TV roles.

In 2017, Kelis joined BBC One&#x27;s singing contest &quot;Pitch Battle&quot; as a judge of the competition with Gareth Malone. In 2020, Kelis competed as the Daisy in the British version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, where she was eliminated in the fifth episode.

==Personal life==
Kelis met rapper Nas at an MTV Video Music Awards party in 2002. Soon after, they became engaged, and married in a civil ceremony in July 2003, followed by a lavish wedding in January 2005. In April 2009, she filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She was seven months pregnant at the time. In July 2009, Kelis gave birth to her first son. The couple&#x27;s divorce was finalized in May 2010. Kelis has described her relationship with Nas as physically and mentally abusive, crediting the anticipated birth of her child as a factor in her decision to end her marriage. Kelis also recalled that the domestic violence incident between Rihanna and Chris Brown influenced her decision to leave Nas. After she saw pictures of Rihanna battered, she felt embarrassed because she also had bruises all over her body, but she was hesitant to speak about it. Nas replied to the accusations on social media, accusing Kelis of attempting to slander him in the time of a custody battle and accusing Kelis of abusing his daughter. In addition to the domestic abuse claims, she alleged that Nas&#x27; drinking habit began to damage their relationship, and he had been having adulterous affairs for two years. They are involved in an ongoing custody battle over their son. In April 2018, Kelis claimed that until 2012, she had not seen &quot;a single cent&quot; from Nas in child support and he has not been an active parent. She said &quot;He doesn&#x27;t participate. He shows up when it&#x27;s fun, he shows up when there&#x27;s a good photo-op...I don&#x27;t think it should be 50/50 just because you had sperm involved.&quot;

In March 2007, Kelis was detained by police in Miami Beach, Florida and charged with disorderly conduct. The arrest report said an operation in which officers posed as prostitutes in the South Beach nightclub district was disrupted when Kelis started screaming racial profanities at them. She was sent to Miami-Dade County Jail and was later released on a $1,500 bond. In September 2008, Kelis was acquitted of the charges. A spokesman for Kelis further commented that the singer would file a lawsuit against the Miami Beach Police, claiming unlawful arrest and the violation of her civil rights.

Kelis married photographer Mike Mora in 2014, and gave birth to her second son in November 2015. Since January 2020, Kelis has been living on a remote farm outside Los Angeles that she manages. In September 2020, she gave birth to her and Mora&#x27;s second child, a daughter. In September 2021, Mora revealed publicly that he had stage IV stomach cancer. In an Instagram post, he stated he had been diagnosed with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in September 2020 and given eighteen months to live. Mora died on March 14, 2022, at age 37.

==Artistry==
AXS called Kelis a &quot;punky, rebellious&quot; singer-songwriter. &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered Kelis&#x27;s vocals &quot;dynamic&quot; and commended her for being &quot;well schooled in the intricacies of heartache&quot;. IGN described Kelis as being &quot;strange, weird, and eccentric&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that Kelis made the most of &quot;a voice that lives in the basement&quot;.

Kelis&#x27;s debut album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; took influence from a variety of 1970s genres, which included urban, rock, jazz, hip hop, R&amp;B, soul, and disco music. Kelis cited early Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington as major influences for the album. Several of the album&#x27;s tracks were designed for clubs, and contained electro beats meant for dancing. Her second studio album &quot;Wanderland&quot; resembles musically its predecessor while exploring more modern funk sounds, dabbling heavily into genres such as soul and rap. It carried on the same themes developed in &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, and was criticized for doing so.

&quot;Food&quot; (2014) contains influences of soul, funk, gospel, and Afrobeat—Kelis said of the album &quot;You know, those records in your life that your parents played and they resonate with who you are? They make you nostalgic. I wanted to find out how to get that feeling.&quot;

<text>Expo 2005 was a world expo held for 185 days between Friday, March 25 and Sunday, September 25, 2005, in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, east of the city of Nagoya. Japan has also hosted Expo &#x27;70 Osaka (World Expo), Expo &#x27;75 Okinawa (Specialised Expo), Expo &#x27;85 Tsukuba (Specialised Expo), and Expo &#x27;90 Osaka (Horticultural Expo) and will host Expo 2025 Osaka (World Expo).
The site of the expo would become the Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park after it ended and is now the home of Ghibli Park.

==Theme==
The theme of the Expo was &quot;Nature&#x27;s Wisdom&quot;, with national and corporate pavilions expressing themes of ecological co-existence, renewable technology, and the wonders of nature. In Japanese, this is rendered as &quot;Ai-chikyūhaku&quot; (愛・地球博), which means (roughly) &quot;Love the Earth Expo,&quot; as well as being a play on the name of the host prefecture, 愛知 (Aichi). According to the official website:
: &quot;We must come together and share our experience and wisdom, in order to create a new direction for humanity which is both sustainable and harmonious with nature.&quot;

==Location==
The main site of the Expo was a forested area in Nagakute, east of Nagoya, covering an area of about . A smaller area of nearby, accessible by gondola from the main site near Seto was also part of the Expo. Great care was taken to build the pavilions out of recycled or recyclable materials, to minimize environmental impact on the site, and to provide environmentally friendly transportation to and within the Expo area.

The cost of the Expo has been estimated at 340 billion yen ($3.3 billion). However, the recorded 22,049,544 visitors greatly exceeded the target of 15,000,000 and the Expo made a profit of over 10 billion yen.

The nearby city of Toyota also held some related events, although there was no special area set aside.

The area in Nagakute can be reached from Nagoya by subway (Higashiyama line) to the last stop in Fujigaoka, followed by a ride on the newly built Linimo magnetic levitation train.

<text>The Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) is a standardized test administered by the College Board and cosponsored by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) in the United States. In the 2018–2019 school year, 2.27 million high school sophomores and 1.74 million high school juniors took the PSAT. It is expected that in 2024, 3.5 million students will take this exam, according to National Merit Scholarship Corporation. 

Scores from the PSAT/NMSQT are used to determine eligibility and qualification for the National Merit Scholarship Program.

==History ==

The PSAT has been administered every fall since 1971. Some PSAT scores obtained before June 1993 are accepted as qualifying evidence for admission to intellectual clubs such as Intertel and American Mensa.

Prior to 1997, the PSAT was composed of only Math and Verbal sections. The Verbal section received a double weighting to allow a full composite score of 240 points. The Writing Skills section, introduced in 1997, was partially derived from the discontinued Test of Standard Written English (TSWE).

The PSAT changed its format and content in Fall 2015. Originally, each of the three sections was scored on a scale of 20 to 80 points, adding up to a maximum composite score of 240 points. This paralleled the SAT, which is graded on a scale of 200 to 800 for each section (the narrower range is to distinguish from which test a score comes and to denote less accuracy). However, unlike the old (2005) SAT, the old PSAT did not include higher-level mathematics (e.g. concepts from Algebra II) or an essay in its writing section (which was added to the SAT in 2005). The number of multiple-choice answers was reduced from five to four, improving the likelihood of making a successful guess, and the quarter-point penalty for wrong answers was eliminated.

Continuing with the College board&#x27;s transition to digital SATs internationally, the first digital PSATs were administered in October 2023.

== Format and scoring==
Students register for the exam through high schools that are members of the College Board. The test is composed of two sections: reading and Writing and Math. Each section has two modules. Each Reading and Writing module lasts 32 minutes, and each Math module lasts 35 minutes, for a total of 2 hours and 14 minutes.

The PSAT changed its format and content again in the Fall of 2023, continuing the transition to digital tests. The Reading and Writing Sections are combined into one section score, and the Math section now allows calculators on all sections. The scores for each section range from 120 to 760, adding up to a maximum score of 1520. Yet the National Merit Scholarship Corporation takes each section score, scored on a scale of 6 to 38, sums it, and then doubles that sum to devise the Selection Index, ranging from 36 to 228.

===Levels of recognition===
There are three levels of recognition: &quot;Commended&quot;, Semi-Finalists, and Finalists. About 34,000 students, which is 3-4% of all PSAT takers, are &quot;commended&quot; and receive Letters of Commendation.

The &quot;commended&quot; cut-off is determined at whichever score yields the 96th percentile nationally. It rose from 202 for the 2006 Program (2004 PSAT) to 203 for the 2007 Program (2005 PSAT). It was 205 for the 2008 Program (2006 PSAT) and 209 for the 2009 Program (2007 PSAT).

Students are confirmed as semifinalists as seniors, one year after taking the PSAT. Afterward, students must complete an application to become finalists that includes grade point average, extracurricular activities, school recommendations, and awards and honors alongside a confirming SAT or ACT score. Approximately 95% of semifinalists quality as finalists as of 2024.

==Popular culture==
In recent years, it has become a popular subject of discourse among test-takers on various social media networks. Many of them poke fun at passages or questions in the PSAT that they find strange or amusing. The level of discussion is so significant that in 2013, the hashtag #PSAT reached trending status on Twitter near its administration date. This is even though since 2012, test participants have been required to copy and sign a statement agreeing to the test regulations, which include not discussing the test. Previously, that statement had to be written in cursive, a requirement that had drawn ire from both students and teachers, as many students found writing the statement in cursive to be difficult. However, in 2015, the requirement to write the statement in cursive was removed.

Wenzhou is located at the extreme southeast of Zhejiang, bordering Lishui to the west, Taizhou to the north, and the province of Fujian to the south. The area consists of mostly mountainous terrain, as well as hundreds of islands off the East China Sea coast, which is nearly in length. It is said that the city&#x27;s land is 70% mountains, 20% farmland, and 10% water. At the time of the 2010 Chinese census, 3,039,500 people lived in Wenzhou&#x27;s urban area. The greater Wenzhou prefecture, which also includes three satellite cities and six counties, had a population totalling 9,122,100, of which 31.16% are residents originally from outside of Wenzhou.

During the 19th century, the progenitor city of modern Wenzhou was known as Yungkia (, &quot;Yǒngjiā&quot;), a prosperous foreign treaty port that remains well-preserved today. Being situated in the mountains, it has been isolated for most of its history from the rest of the country, making its local culture and language, known as Wenzhounese, particularly distinct, even from its direct neighbours. The city is also the native land of many emigrants to Europe and the United States, with many Wenzhounese immigrants abroad becoming entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, and retail and wholesale businesspeople in their adopted countries. Wenzhou people make up a large proportion of the Chinese residents in Italy, constituting approximately 90% of Tuscany&#x27;s Chinese population. Significant concentrations of Wenzhounese also live in New York City, as well as across France and Spain.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The area that would become Wenzhou has archeological artifacts tracing back to around 2500 BC, when it became known for its pottery production, and as one of the origins of celadon in ancient China. The Ouyue culture developed into the Kingdom of Dong&#x27;ou, with a history dating back more than 2,200 years. Due to its relatively isolated geography, the culture of Dong&#x27;ou tended in ancient times to often at first develop according to local patterns.

===Imperial China===
In the early second century BC, shortly after the destruction of the Qin dynasty, military and political leader Zou Yao () of Wenzhou helped Emperor Gaozu of Han, the first emperor of the Han Dynasty, defeat the prominent Chu warlord Xiang Yu. After the victory, Gaozu&#x27;s son Hui named Zhou Yao as the king of the Dong&#x27;ou kingdom, with its new capital near present-day Wenzhou. This polity would last from 191 BC until it was conquered by the Minyue kingdom in 138 BC.

Wenzhou&#x27;s present name is due to the city&#x27;s mild weather.

The city walls were built in the 10th century, and its seven gates were erected in 1598.

===Modern era===
Throughout its history, Wenzhou&#x27;s traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern Zhejiang Province. In early European sources, the name Wenzhou-Fu or -Foo was often transcribed Ouen-tcheou-fou or Wen-tcheou after the accounts of French-speaking missionaries. In 1876, Wenzhou opened for tea exports, which led to a significant Wenzhounese diaspora of merchants in France, but no foreign settlement was ever established there. Between 1937 and 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War (i.e., World War II), Wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under Chinese control. It declined in the later years of the war, but began to recover after coastal trade along the Zhejiang coast was re-established in 1955.

==Fengshui of Wenzhou==
Wenzhou is the only city in China designed by Guo Pu (), the father of the Fengshui philosophical system. During the Jin Dynasty, Guo Pu organised Wenzhou on the basis of the Fengshui philosophical system along with the Twenty-Eight Mansions, and the Five Elements. These philosophies develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of &quot;invisible forces&quot; that unite the universe, earth, and humanity together.

Believers in Fengshui consider Wenzhou to possess the best Feng Shui conditions and nature of all the Chinese cities. Other cities considered to possess excellent Fengshui nature are Beijing, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Kunming, Hengyang, and Shenzhen. However, none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of Fengshui or designed by the father of Fengshui, Guo Pu. People from all over China usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of Wenzhounese as a result of Wenzhou&#x27;s Fengshui development by Guo Pu.

===Guo Pu===
When Guo Pu climbed to the top of West Guo Mountain () in Wenzhou, he saw the range of mountains of Wenzhou shaped as a dipper and the city itself shaped as a key. Wenzhou is still nicknamed the &quot;Dipper city&quot; based on the popular geographical saying &quot;mountains as dipper, city as key&quot; (). Legend has it that during the time when Wenzhou was being established and developed, a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth, therefore Wenzhou is also known as &quot;Deer City&quot; (). Today, the Lucheng District is the name of downtown Wenzhou and the White Deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals .

Guo Pu is honoured today by the renaming of West Guo Mountain, where he stood to observe the city, into Guo Gong Mountain. At the bottom of Guo Gong Mountain, a temple was also built and named Guo Gong Temple. In 2003, the local government constructed a statue of Guo Pu in downtown Wenzhou.

==Geography==
With jurisdiction over four districts, two county-level cities and five counties, Wenzhou covers a land area of and sea area of . The population of the prefectural level city is 9.12 million including 2.30 million urban residents, divided among 3 county-level cities and 4 districts.

Most of Wenzhou&#x27;s landscape is mountainous, with many mountain tops reaching altitudes in excess of , for example in the Yandang Mountains, a coastal mountain range dominating the eastern part of prefecture. Another dominating landscape element is the Ou River, the largest river in Wenzhou prefecture. There are some coastal plains, notably around the mouth of the Ou (where the city proper of Wenzhou is located), the Nanxi River, a tributary of the Ou, and further south, around the mouth of the Feiyun River (in Rui&#x27;an, a county-level city). Coastal plains are used intensively for agriculture but also host much of the population and industry.

The long coastline gives the city abundant marine resources and has many islands. Dongtou, one of the districts in Wenzhou, has also been called the &quot;County of One Hundred Islands.&quot; Dongtou County was renamed as Dongtou District in September 2015 following the State Council-sanctioned administrative region adjustments.

Wenzhou boasts wonderful landscapes with rugged mountains and tranquil waters, including three state-level scenic spots, namely the Yandang Mountains, the Nanxi River and the Baizhangji Fall-Feiyun Lake, and two national nature reserves, the Wuyanling Ridge and the Nanji Islands. Yandang Mountain has been named as a World Geopark, while the Nanji Islands are listed a UNESCO Marine Nature Reserve of World Biosphere Reserves. Scenic areas account for 25% of the city&#x27;s land space.

==Climate==
Wenzhou derives its present name from its climate, and has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with short winters and long, hot, humid summers. Summers are similar to the remainder of the province (albeit slightly cooler during the daytime as compared to inland areas), but winter is much milder, partly due to the southerly location and partly due to the sheltering effect of the surrounding mountains. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July and August, while the annual mean is . Heavy rainfalls occur in late spring and early summer due to the plum rains of the East Asian monsoon, while typhoons are commonly a threat in the second half of summer causing considerable damage and destruction. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 26% in March to 53% in August, the city receives 1,706 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from (though an unofficial record low of was recorded on 17 January 1893) to .

==Administration==

The prefecture-level city of Wenzhou currently administers four districts, three county-level cities and five counties. Its population at 2010 census:





==Economy==
 Wenzhou exports food, tea, wine, jute, timber, paper and alunite (a non-metallic mineral used to make alum and fertilizer). Alunite is abundant and Wenzhou claims to be the &quot;Alunite Capital of the World&quot;. Its 10 main industries each exceeding 1.5 billion dollars are electrical machinery, leather products, general equipment, power supply, plastic manufacturing, textile and garment, transport equipment, chemical products, metal products and metal processing.

From the 1990s, low-voltage electric appliances manufacturing became one of the major industries in Wenzhou, with some of the large private enterprises setting up joint ventures with GE and Schneider.

In 1994, exploration for oil and natural gas commenced in the East China Sea off the coast of Wenzhou. Companies such as Texaco, Chevron, Shell and JAPEX have started to drill for oil but the operations have been largely unsuccessful.

Wenzhou is a city full of vibrant business activities. When China began economic reforms in 1978, Wenzhou was the first city in China to set up individual and private enterprises as well as shareholder cooperatives. It has also taken the lead in carrying out financial system reform and structural reform in townships. Being a pioneer in utilizing marketing mechanism to develop urban constructions, Wenzhou has won a number of firsts in China and set many national records.

From 1978 through 2016, the GDP of Wenzhou, a third-tier city in China, has increased from 1.32 billion RMB to 504.54 billion RMB with the gross fiscal revenue increasing from 0.135 billion RMB to 72.4 billion RMB, and the disposable net per capita income for rural residents increasing from 113.5 RMB to 22,985 RMB. The per capita disposable income for urban residents increased from 422.6 RMB in 1981 to 47,785 RMB in 2016, which is among the highest in China.

===Financial reform pilot project===

In late March 2012, China&#x27;s State Council announced that Wenzhou would be the site of a pilot project for the reform of private investment rules. The city had been a significant source of illegal loans, and this project would legalize and provide a regulatory framework for such activities. It has been seen not only as an attempt to legitimize Wenzhou&#x27;s private finance market, but also as a model for cleaning up underground lending in China as a whole.

===Birthplace of China&#x27;s private economy===
In the early days of economic reforms, local Wenzhounese took the lead in China in developing a commodity economy, household industries and specialized markets. Many thousands of people and families were engaged in household manufacturing to develop individual and private economy (private enterprise). Until now, Wenzhou has a total of 240,000 individually owned commercial and industrial units and 130,000 private enterprises of which 180 are group companies, four among China&#x27;s top 500 enterprises and 36 among national 500 top private enterprises. There are 27 national production bases such as &quot;China&#x27;s Shoes Capital&quot; and &quot;China&#x27;s Capital of Electrical Equipment&quot;, China&#x27;s 40 famous trademarks and China&#x27;s famous-brand products and 67 national inspection-exempt products in the city. The development of private economy in Wenzhou has created the &quot;Wenzhou Economic Model&quot;, which inspires the modernization drive in China.

The city of Wenzhou is a world leader in lighter manufacturing with over 500 such companies in the city. The plastic weaving cluster in Wenzhou comprised 1600 enterprises in 2001, employing 42,000 people with an annual output value of 20 billion Yuan. The Local cluster comprised 400 manufacturers in 2001 with a total output of 5 billion Yuan, representing 65 percent of the domestic market share. The cluster is the first in China in terms of market share and sold it products to 60 countries.

There are many areas in which people of Wenzhou opened the first example of private economy in post-1949 China. For instance, Juneyao Airlines started in July 1991, which is the first private airline company in China. Jinwen Rail Way is also the first rail way company which is built with private capital.

===Industrial zones===
====Wenzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone====
This zone was established and approved by state council in 1992. The main traffic system around the zone include No.104 National Highway, Ningbo-Wenzhou Expressway and Wenzhou Bridge. It is located near to Wenzhou International Airport and Wenzhou Port. Industries encouraged in the zone include electrical equipment, electronic information, chemical medicine, building materials, and textiles.

====Wenzhou Oujiang River Estuary Industrial Zone====

This zone is in the east of the city proper, with industrial focuses mainly on logistics, cultural and tourism industry, smart manufacturing, information technology, as well as electronics and petrochemical industry near the coastal area of Dongtou. The traffic system around the zone include the Oujiang Beikou Bridge.

===Oufei Project===
In 2014, the Oufei Project () was initiated as a land reclamation project in Wenzhou. The original targeted area upon completion was mu (124 sq km), with an estimated construction cost of 60 billion RMB (&quot;c.&quot; US$8bn). The aim of the project is to promote economic development, and it would serve as the largest land reclamation project in China as of 2020. In 2015 the project secured an 4.5 billion RMB in a low-interest long-term loans, receiving provincial-level support. The tideland reclamation was accomplished using a vacuum preloading method, with a planned size of 323.4 square kilometers. There was some academic criticism of the project&#x27;s potential damage to waterbird coastal habitats.

==Transport==
===Air===
The Wenzhou Longwan International Airport serves the Wenzhou area, with scheduled flights to major cities in mainland China as well as Hong Kong and Macau. New direct air routes to Taipei and Cheju Island of South Korea were introduced in 2012. The airport is situated on the southeast of the city (approximately away). It&#x27;s been graded as Category B civil airport, serving a population of 20 million spanning areas of Wenzhou, Taizhou and Lishui of Zhejiang and Ningde of the neighbouring Fujian. The correlated GDP of the area reaches 300 billion RMB.

The Airport started opening up in 1995 and direct flight to Macau was approved. Air route to Hong Kong was open in 1996. Linking 65 cities in the country with 34 permanently operating air routes, the Airport is among the fastest-growing and profitable among its peers in China.

The Airport ranks first in terms of passenger transit among cities of same level in China. In 2004, the Airport handled 29,700 landings, a passenger transit of 2.439 million, cargo throughput of 38,500 tons.

The new Terminal 2 was launched on 1 June 2018, which handle all domestic flights. The Terminal 1 was changed to international terminal that handles all international and regional (specifically from Wenzhou to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) flights. The Terminal 2 is equipped with 21 boarding bridges, 22 security check passages, 52 check-in counters (four check-in zones, A, B, C, and D) and 6 luggage claim systems. The launch of Terminal 2 is a huge milestone in the history of Wenzhou air traffic development.

===Railway===

Because of Wenzhou&#x27;s geographic location, it is difficult to build a railway to connect it with other cities. Wenzhou&#x27;s first railway, the Jinhua–Wenzhou railway, opened on 11 June 1998. The railway runs from Wenzhou railway station northwest to Jinhua and is operated by the Jinwen Railway Company. The railway has a total length of , including 135 bridges of in length 96 tunnels of in length. The Jinwen Railway was the first in China to be built with local capital, and gave birth to China&#x27;s first standardized joint-stock enterprise: Zhejiang Jinwen Railway Development Co., Ltd.

In September 2009, two high-speed railways opened in Wenzhou. The Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway runs north to Hangzhou, and the Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway, runs south to Xiamen. Both lines accommodate high-speed CRH (China Railway High-speed) trains running at speeds of up to and have dramatically shortened rail travel time to neighboring cities. The Jinhua–Wenzhou high-speed railway was opened on 26 December 2015.

Lucheng District in Wenzhou was the site of China&#x27;s only major high-speed rail accident to date.

===Rapid transit===

Wenzhou Mass Transit Railway Investment Group was launched in February 2011 with registered capital of 2 billion RMB, sole purpose being in the design, investment, construction and operation of the Wenzhou Mass Transit Rail Corporation, which will consist of regional (S-series lines) and local rapid transit lines in Wenzhou. The S-Lines serve regional transportation among Wenzhou&#x27;s Counties and Districts. The first line, Line S1 stretching 53.5 kilometers, opened on 23 January 2019. Construction of Line S2 started on 30 December 2015. A preliminary application with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is underway for the initiation of the construction of metro lines M1 and M2, with a total length of .

==Yongjia School==
The Yongjia School () is considered one of the most distinctive schools of thought in the history of China and was one of the three most influential schools of thought in the Song Dynasty. It has a high status in Chinese philosophy. Since its founding it has been the cultural gene of the Wenzhou and has influenced China.

===Main characteristics===
There are four main characteristics and aspects of the Yongjia School.
First, it emphasizes the significance of practice over pure theory. Second, it proposes that chivalry should not be divorced from welfare. Third, it promotes the conglomeration of agriculture and commerce. Fourth it underscores the significance of powerful military and economic prosperity.

===Market economy and capitalism===
Yongjia School is arguably the only prestigious Chinese school of thought of which the main teachings emphasize currency, commerce, and private economy. Modern scholars attribute the unprecedented economic prosperity in the Song Dynasty to the influence of Yongjia School.

==Chinese opera==
During the Northern Song Dynasty in the 12th century, Nan Opera, also called as the Wenzhou Opera and Yongjia Opera, was produced in Wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional Chinese Opera in the history of China. In its early stage of development, Nan Opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in Wenzhou influenced by Yongjia School of Thought. Wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in Southern Song Dynasty expanded the influence of Nan Opera greatly. Since then, Nan Opera gained its great influence in China and reached its peak in Yuan Dynasty and remained its prominent status in Ming Dynasty.

In the time period of late Yuan Dynasty, the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave Nan Opera of Wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development. Therefore, in late Yuan Dynasty, Nan Opera of Wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in Ming Dynasty, its original Wenzhou tone of Opera sung in Wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by Kun Shan tone of Opera. Later on, because of the replacement in tone, Nan Opera gradually transcended into its later form &quot;chuanqi&quot;, and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in Ming Dynasty.

===Role distribution system===
On the stage setting of a Nan Opera performance, there are generally seven role distribution elements, Life (), Denier (), Ugliness (), Clarity (), Finale (), Exterior (), Attachment (), with the main drama plot developed around Life () and Denial () complemented usually by Ugliness (), Clarity (), and Finale (). This stage setting system of Nan Opera invented in Wenzhou with seven-element role distribution principle is the earliest complete on-stage role distribution principle system in the history of Chinese Opera.

===Four Miracles of Yuan Dynasty===
Although Nan opera is the first mature form of traditional Chinese opera, throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of Chinese opera, Nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early Yuan Dynasty who held great contempt for the Southern Chinese people.

Despite the great resistance, local Wenzhounese that kept on developing Nan Drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the &quot;Jing Cha Tale&quot;, &quot;Bai Tu Tale&quot;, &quot;Bai Yue Ting&quot;, and &quot;Sha Gou Ji&quot;, which were later known as the &quot;Four Miracles&quot; of Yuan Dynasty. According to modern studies, at least half of the Four Miracles were entirely created by local Wenzhounese artists with no non-local supplements and the other two consisting of some non-local supplements.

===&quot;Tale of the Pipa&quot;===
&quot;Tale of the Pipa&quot; (or &quot;Tale of Lute&quot;) created by local Wenzhounese Gao Ming is a work of Nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in mid-Yuan Dynasty.

It is called the connecting bridge of the time of Nan opera and the time of &quot;chuanqi&quot;. The creation of Tale of the Pipa is among the greatest achievements of Chinese Opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional Chinese opera, and therefore, it is usually called as the &quot;Ancestor of all Plays&quot; in China along with Nan drama being called as the &quot;Ancestor of all Operas&quot; in China. In the 19th century, Tale of the Pipa was translated into English, French, German and Latin. Ever since it was published in modern era, the Lute Song has been significant in the history of Western appreciation of Chinese literature.

The first translation of Lute Song was published in 1841 in Paris by Imprimerie Royale, written by Antoine (A. P. L.) Bazin titled Le Pi-pa-ki ou l&#x27;Histoire de Luth, making the history of the first &quot;chuanqi&quot; play published in a Western language In 1946, American musical comedy based on Tale of the Pipa, titled Lute Song written by Will Irwin, Sidney Howard and starred Yul Brenner and Mary Martin, was produced on Broadway.

===Nancy Reagan===
&quot;Tale of the Pipa&quot; is also the only Broadway appearance of then-future First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan. In the play of Lute Song, Nancy Reagan &quot;dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl&quot;, and the show&#x27;s producer told her, &quot;You look like you could be Chinese&quot;.

Like all the other Nan Opera plays written by local Wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of Wenzhounese, the Lute Song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter, and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera.

===Four forms of Nan opera===
After the invention of Nan opera in Wenzhou in the 12th century, Nan Opera soon after started to spread its influence all across China as the first-ever mature form of Chinese opera. At the time in Ming Dynasty, the original form of Nan Opera sung in Wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into 4 different forms that were sung in four different tones(melodies). However, some scholars today argue that Nan Opera in Ming Dynasty were sung in five different tones (melodies).

The original Nan Opera gave births to four different forms of itself in Ming Dynasty: Haiyan Tone (), Yuyao Tone (), Kunshan Tone (), and Yiyang Tone (). Among the four forms, the most popular one today is known as the Kun Opera that evolved from the Kunshan Tone of Nan Opera in Ming Dynasty. Kun Opera is listed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO since 2001.

==Mathematics==
Wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern China are made by local Wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars. In 1896, the father of oracle bone script decipherment, Wenzhounese scholar Sun Yirang, founded the first-ever mathematics academy in the history of China, Ruian Mathematics Academy () in Wenzhou. A year later, in 1897, local Wenzhounese Huang Qingcheng founded the first-ever periodical of mathematics in China, &quot;Journal of Arithmetic&quot; (). In 1899, a mathematical association was established in Wenzhou, named &quot;Ruian Heaven Calculation Association&quot; (), making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of China.

===Cradle of Mathematicians===

Wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in the Greater China Region; it has given births to over 200 mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past 100 years. According to numerous reports, in the 20th century, over one-fourth to one-third of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over China were local Wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars. During 2002 International Mathematical Union conference in Beijing, a case study named &quot;analysis of vast communal formation of Wenzhounese mathematicians&quot; () was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world. The goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance of the cultural influence of Wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics. The case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in China and around the world. Such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city, Wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world.

In an interview with local Wenzhounese mathematician, one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern China Su Buqing, conducted by Wenzhounese science fiction writer Ye Yonglie, many unknown details of the local Wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed. Ye Yonglie was told by Su Buqing that &quot;many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in China were local Wenzhounese and in the conferences of International Mathematical Union, the local language of Wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language English.&quot; Moreover, when Ye Yonglie asked Su Buqing whether &quot;the commonly shared Wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming Large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians&quot;, Su Buqing answered &quot;No, no, no. It&#x27;s rather because the entire area of Wenzhou is too poor to do science, and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math, therefore, most of the Wenzhounese people just started to do math, and then, generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city.&quot;

===Jiang Lifu===
Wenzhounese mathematician Jiang Lifu is commonly considered as the father of mathematics and pioneer of geometry in modern China. Jiang was the second person in modern China&#x27;s history to obtain a PhD in mathematics and the first to do so in Wenzhou. In 1920, he returned to China and founded the Department of Mathematics at Nankai University, the second-ever mathematics department in the history of modern China. He was the only professor and teacher in the department for the first four years and was very strict with his teaching and students.

In 1940, Jiang became the chairman of the &quot;Neo-China Mathematics Society.&quot; In 1947, Jiang founded the Institute of Mathematics of Academia Sinica and was the institute&#x27;s founding director. He appointed his student, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century, Shiing-Shen Chern to become the institute&#x27;s acting director in Shanghai. Jiang also played a pioneering and fundamental role in encouraging and arranging foreign studies of mathematics for Chinese students in modern China in the early 20th century.

Mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern once noted that &quot;for many years, Mr. Jiang was the foremost leader in the field of mathematics in China&quot;(在许多年的时间里，姜先生是中国数学界最主要的领袖). Su Buqing also noted that &quot;his influence and contribution to mathematics in modern China is so grand that without him, mathematics in China would have been completely different&quot;(他对中国现代数学事业功劳重大，影响至深，没有他，中国数学面貌将会是另一个样子).

===Shiing-Shen Chern===
In October 2003, mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern visited Wenzhou as invited by Wenzhounese mathematician Gu Chaohao. During his visit, Chern wrote five words in Chinese calligraphy, &quot;Home of Mathematicians,&quot; as he was marveled by the large number of prominent mathematicians and mathematical scholars from the city of Wenzhou. Throughout Chern&#x27;s life, he developed many close and meaningful relationships with mathematicians from Wenzhou.

For instance, Chern&#x27;s first mathematics teacher, mentor, and professor in life is Wenzhounese mathematician, Jiang Lifu. Jiang was the second person in modern China&#x27;s history to obtain a PhD in mathematics and founded the Department of Mathematics at Nankai University, Chern&#x27;s alma mater. Chern once noted that &quot;I specialize in geometry because of my professor in college, Dr. Jiang&quot;(我从事几何大都亏了我的大学老师姜立夫博士) and &quot;my fundamental mathematical education was all given by Mr. Jiang through dictation&quot;(我的基本数学训练都是姜先生口授的).

===Taiwanese high-tech industry===
Wenzhounese mathematician Shu Shien-Siu is today considered as the father of the high-tech industry in Taiwan while the high-tech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to Taiwan&#x27;s economy. When Siu was the Minister of Science and Technology from 1973 to 1980, he proposed to establish the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park in Hsinchu in 1976.

After Siu&#x27;s revolutionary proposal, rounds of debate about the location of Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park unfolded. Chiang Ching-kuo argued that the park should be built in Longtan District in Taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and future relationship between the military field and the park. However, Shu Shien-Siu argued that the park should be built in Hsinchu because what Taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economic power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military. Therefore, Siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park. Also, Longtan District was a relatively remote place as compared to Hsinchu and thus, the potential of the park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in Longtan District.

More importantly, Siu&#x27;s decision made in 1976 is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park. Siu wanted the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park to be like Silicon Valley which is adjacent to Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. Thinking differently from Chiang Ching-kuo, Siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park could benefit from the National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University. Therefore, Siu determined to manage to build the park in Hsinchu, where both universities are located at.

Today, Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park is commonly considered as the Silicon Valley of the Orient and the high-tech industry stands as the biggest contributor to Taiwan&#x27;s economy.

===Higher education in Taiwan===
In 1961, Shu Shien-Siu founded the Department of Mathematics at National Tsing Hua University, one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan. A year later in 1962, Siu founded the Summer Mathematics Conference, the first-ever mathematical conference in the history of Taiwan.

When Siu became the president of National Tsing Hua University in 1970, there were only 3 academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over 660 people including faculty members. In order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of Taiwan, Siu organized to establish the college of engineering that consists of five departments and expanded the Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of two departments and one institute. From 1971 to 1973, Siu managed to employ a total of 165 professors with doctoral degrees. Also, during his presidency, Siu carried out the 15-year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on the construction of buildings on campus such as the Department of Chemistry, the auditorium, the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as Siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students.

By the time he left National Tsing Hua University in 1975, the university had a total of nine departments, three colleges, and 13 institutes with a student population of over 2200 (including graduate students) and academic staff population of over 160. In 1975, after Siu&#x27;s five years of presidency, National Tsing Hua University placed first in all three fields of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in Taiwan.

As Siu was deeply influenced by the Yongjia School of Thought when he grew up in Wenzhou, during his presidential career at the university, Siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional Chinese belief of the importance of theory, and also made it clear that as students, the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus. One of the most influential quotes of Siu is &quot;What we need the most are the practitioners, who directly involve, but not the theorists&quot; (). That main idea held by Siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of Yongjia School of Thought, the cultural gene of the city of Wenzhou. Such a unique form of philosophy of Siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on the school and Taiwan&#x27;s history as today, National Tsing Hua University is known for its emphasis on practicality in Taiwan.

==&quot;City of chess&quot;==
In 1995, Wenzhou was given the title of &quot;City of Chess&quot; by China Qiyuan, the official agency responsible for all board games and card games in mainland China. In 2020, Wenzhou celebrated its 25th anniversary of being the &quot;City of Chess&quot; in China. President of FIDE Arkady Dvorkovich sent a congratulatory letter to Wenzhou remarking that &quot;Wenzhou has given births to many genius chess players, Ye Rongguang, Zhu Chen, Ding Liren, congratulate the 25th anniversary of Wenzhou being titled the &quot;City of Chess&quot; in China.

===Zhu Chen===
Wenzhounese chess practitioner and grandmaster Zhu Chen is the first and currently, the only, chess player in the history of the world to win all youth, junior, and adult world championships. In August 1988, Zhu placed first and won the World Girls Under 12 Championship in Romania. In September 1994, Zhu placed first and won the World Girls Junior Chess Championship in Matinhos, Brazil.

Zhu is the current treasurer of FIDE Management Board and FIDE Council as well as Vice President of FIDE Zonal Council.

==Culture and demographics==
===Language===

Wenzhou natives speak a language of Wu Chinese, the language family shared by Hangzhou, Ningbo, Suzhou and Shanghai; called Wenzhounese, also known as Oujiang () or Dong&#x27;ou (). Geographic isolation and the immigration of Southern Min speakers from nearby Fujian have caused Wenzhounese to evolve into a very phonologically divergent hybrid difficult for outsiders to understand. As a result, even the adjacent Taizhou Wu variety has little mutual intelligibility with Wenzhounese. Conversely, Wenzhounese itself has spread to the Chinese immigrant communities in the Flushing and Brooklyn Chinatowns of New York City.

The esoteric Wenzhounese language is reputed to have been used during the Second Sino-Japanese War during wartime communication and in the Sino-Vietnamese War for programming military ciphers (code). Due to its unique grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, the language is basically impossible for any non-local to understand.

There is a common &quot;fearing&quot; rhymed saying in China that reflects the extreme comprehension difficulty of Wenzhounese: &quot;Fear not the Heavens, fear not the Earth, but fear the Wenzhou person speaking Wenzhounese.&quot; ()

===Religion===

Most of the Wenzhou people practice Chinese folk religion as people in the rest of China, while a part of the population is non-religious. In addition, Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity also have a presence in the city.

Prior to 1949 there were 2,000 registered places of worship and 4,500 priests, pastors and monks in the city. But, the state officially designated Wenzhou as an experimental site for an &quot;atheistic zone&quot; () in 1958 and during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), religious buildings were either closed or converted for other uses. Religion revived quickly since the 1980s, and today there are more registered places of worship than before. Specifically, the city has 8,569 registered folk religious temples and 3,961 registered places of worship of the five institutional religions (Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism). The city was the forefront in the registration and management of folk religious temples which was started in January 2015 and later extended to all Zhejiang.

====&quot;China&#x27;s Jerusalem&quot;====
The city has been for centuries a hub of Christian missionary activity; prior to 1949 it was home to 115,000 Christians, more than one-tenth of the total Christians in China at that time. Today it remains an important center of Christianity in China. In 2006, it was reported that between 15 and 20% of the city&#x27;s population was Christian. In 2012, according to official data the city&#x27;s Christians were at least one million (about 11% of the 2010 population). Because of its large concentration of Christians, the city has been dubbed the &quot;Jerusalem of the East&quot; or &quot;China&#x27;s Jerusalem&quot; in some media reports.

In recent years, the prominence of Wenzhou&#x27;s Christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action. In 2014 CNN reported that local Communist Party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than 300 church crosses. More recent reports have updated the numbers to over 200 churches destroyed and 2,000 crosses removed. The Chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of Christians, pointing instead to violations of land-use regulations as the reason for its actions. However, independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, for example, reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of Christianity in the region. Specifically, the &quot;Times&quot; cites a nine-page statement of provincial policy, singling-out the Christian community as targets for the regulation of &quot;excessive religious sites&quot; and &quot;overly popular&quot; religious activities. &quot;The priority,&quot; the document states, &quot;is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways, national highways and provincial highways,&quot; as well as to, &quot;Over time and in batches, bring down the crosses from the rooftops to the facade of the buildings.&quot; The provincial policy has met with some resistance. A Christian pastor who protested the removal of the crosses and the beating of 50 Christians was also jailed in 2015.

===Tourism===
An essay written by Zhu Ziqing on the beauty of Meiyu Pond () and waterfall in the Middle Yandang Mountains in Xianyan Subdistrict, Ouhai District, Wenzhou after his visits to the area in 1923 is among the sixty potential reading selections test takers may be asked to read for the Putonghua Proficiency Test.

With a history of over 120 million years, Yandang Mountains or Yandangshan Mountains, literally the wild goose pond mountain(s) is known for its natural environment, arising from its many vertical rock faces and pinnacles, mountain slopes with forests and bamboo groves, streams, waterfalls and caves.

Nanxi River located in Yongjia County, Nanxi River was famous for its 36 bends and 72 beaches. The main scenic spots of the Nanxi River area include the Furong Triangle Rock, the Waterfall of Tengxi Pool, the Twelve Peaks, the Taogong Cave, the Warehouse Under The Cliff, the Furong Ancient Hamlet and the Lion Rock. It was named as one of the National Tourist Scenic Spots by the State Council and has been listed in Tentative Lists of UNESCO World Heritage.

Covered bridges, Taishun County has more than 900 covered bridges, Wuyanling National Nature Reserve in the west of the county represents significant natural values as well as being a touristic attraction.

Due to the variety and diverseness of local tourism attractions, Wenzhou was voted as the venue for the 2016 Annual Convention of Society for American Travel Writers (SATW) in October 2016, after beating contenders including Israel, the State of Texas, and Royal Caribbean International, the world leading cruise operator.

===Art and literature===
Wenzhou is 1682 years old with a profound and brilliant cultural background. It has given birth to many outstanding people and great scholars. Among them were Wang Shipeng, Chen Fuliang, Ye Shi, Huang Gongwang and Liu Ji during the South Song Dynasty, as well as Sun Yirang, Xia Nai, Xia Chengtao and Su Buqing and others of the modern era. All of them have exerted significant influence in the history of Chinese philosophy, literature and science. Wenzhou is also the origin of China&#x27;s landscape poetry, the founder of which, Xie Lingyun, was the chief of Wenzhou&#x27;s Yongjia Prefecture in the Northern and Southern dynasties period. In Song Dynasty, there were 4 distinguished poets from Yongjia representing the River and Lake Poetry. Moreover, Wenzhou is the birthplace of Nan Drama of China, which is the origin of Chinese traditional drama of which includes drama forms such as Peking Opera and Yue Opera. &quot;The Romance of a Hairpin&quot;, a tale about Wang Shipeng and Qian Yulian, is well known among locals and serves an inspiration for many who have endured life pains but still have faith in love. For instance, &quot;Tale of Lute&quot;, a play by Gao Zecheng of Ming Dynasty, is renowned abroad as one of the most outstanding works of Chinese drama along with Kun Opera of Yongjia which is recognized as the verbal and non-material human heritage. Dancing in public is also part of the Wenzhou culture. Wenzhou, the birthplace of China&#x27;s private economy, likewise is the birthplace of China&#x27;s export-oriented industrialization. From the Southern Song Dynasty, in contrasted to the Confucianism represented by Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan in China urging people to study to be officials in the future, the theory of Wenzhou&#x27;s Yongjia School represented by Ye Shi, emphasized the importance of business. The theory has an enduring impact on the mindset of Wenzhou natives and has become the &quot;cultural gene&quot; in the economic development of Wenzhou ever since.

===Business culture===
Due to both Wenzhou&#x27;s cultural and geographical remoteness and its lack of natural resources (land, minerals, etc.), the Chinese central government has left the people of Wenzhou relatively autonomous. Away from the center of the political and economic stage, its people are more independent, self-reliant, and generally more business and family oriented. Numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from Wenzhou. Hence, when China switched from its planned economy to its so-called capitalist economy with Chinese (socialist) characteristics in the late 1980s, its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it. A popular common saying calls Wenzhounese the &quot;Jews of the Orient&quot; (). Wenzhounese have been stereotyped by other Chinese as real estate speculators. China Daily notes that investments from Wenzhounese buyers play a disproportionately large role in the increased property prices all over China.

The people of Wenzhou are thought to be equipped with business sense and a commercial culture more dominant than anywhere else in China. Wenzhou has two economic characteristics: it was the first to launch a market economy, and it continues to have an active and developed private economy.

==Education==
Wenzhou has one of the largest education sector, constituting 1/6 of the total in Zhejiang Province. As of the end of 2016, Wenzhou has 2368 schools of various kinds (from pre-school to higher education), with number of students stands at 1.4814 million and faculty number of 127,200.

===Higher education===
With most of its universities and colleges established after 1949, before 1949, there was not one single university or college in Wenzhou. The highest educational institution in Wenzhou at the time was senior high school.

There are three major universities in Wenzhou: Wenzhou University, Wenzhou Medical University and Wenzhou-Kean University.
Wenzhou University resulted from the merger of the former University of Wenzhou, Wenzhou Normal College and other various normal colleges in the rural towns of Wenzhou. Its main campus is situated in the University Town, Cha Shan (). The former campus of Wenzhou Normal College on Xueyuan Road () is still in use, while the former main campus of the University of Wenzhou now serves as the campus of the Wenzhou Foreign Language School and the Second Experimental Middle School of Wenzhou (No.13 Middle School).

Wenzhou Medical University is well-known globally in specializing in ophthalmology (national level key discipline), as well as provision of other medical courses. Several of Wenzhou&#x27;s major hospitals are affiliated to this university, with Wenzhou No.1 Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University being the largest in floor space in Asia. The combined population of medical service covered by all the affiliated hospitals of Wenzhou Medical University is said to be over 20 million.

The Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China approved the establishment of Wenzhou-Kean University on 16 November 2011. It is one of the first two Chinese-American cooperatively run universities with legal person status, the other one being NYU Shanghai inaugurated on 15 October 2012.

<text>The 6th United States Army Group (also referred to as the Southern Group of Armies) was an Allied army group that fought in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. Made up of field armies from both the United States Army and the French Army, it fought in France, Germany, Austria, and, briefly, Italy. It was established in July 1944 and commanded throughout its duration by General Jacob L. Devers.

In a lead role in Operation Undertone, its Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured Nuremberg and then Munich. Finally it crossed the Brenner Pass and made contact with the US Fifth Army at Vipiteno, Italy.

==History==
The Sixth Army Group was originally created in Corsica, France (specifically activated on 29 July 1944) as &quot;Advanced Allied Force HQ&quot;, a special headquarters within AFHQ (the headquarters of Henry Maitland Wilson, the Supreme Commander Mediterranean Theatre) commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. Its initial role was to supervise the planning of the combined French and American forces which invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon and provide liaison between these forces and AFHQ. Dragoon was the operational responsibility of the Seventh United States Army commanded by Lt. Gen. Alexander Patch. Available to Patch were three corps (US VI Corps and French I and II Corps) and 24,000 Maquis of the &quot;Forces Francaises de l&#x27;Interieur&quot;. The two French corps constituted &quot;French Army B&quot; commanded by Général Jean de Lattre de Tassigny which was later renamed French First Army. Although Sixth Army Group Headquarters was officially activated on 1 August, it consisted of only the personnel of the Advanced Detachment AFHQ and, for reasons of security, retained the detachment title. The Advanced Detachment headquarters on Corsica had no command or operational duties and functioned primarily as a liaison and coordinating agency while preparing itself for the day it would become operational in France as Sixth Army Group headquarters.

Devers&#x27; headquarters remained subordinate to AFHQ during the invasion and in the weeks immediately afterwards while operational control of the troops on the ground resided with Patch until his forces linked near Dijon, France, with Twelfth United States Army Group&#x27;s Third Army advancing from the west after breaking out of the Normandy beachhead. At this time, on 15 September, Devers&#x27; headquarters was designated Sixth Army Group to take operational control of Seventh Army and French Army B and came under the overall command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces).

In late 1944 and early 1945 the Sixth Army Group was involved in fierce fighting in the Alsace repelling the German advance during Operation Nordwind and subsequent pitched engagements closing off the Colmar Pocket. The 63rd Infantry Division was the first Seventh Army unit to cross the Siegfried Line, and the first to get an entire division through it. The 3rd Infantry Division suffered the highest casualty count of all US divisions, with over 27,000 casualties.

The Army Group later advanced through Bavaria, and eventually into western Austria in the waning days of the war. Elements of Sixth Army Group linked up south of the Brenner Pass on 4 May 1945 with troops of the Fifth United States Army of the Allied 15th Army Group advancing north from Italy. Germany surrendered on 9 May 1945.

The Sixth Army Group effectively inactivated on 15 June 1945 when the US Seventh Army was selected, along with the Third Army, to form the occupation forces of Germany. It remained as an occupation and defensive force in southern Germany into the early 21st Century. It also occupied part of Austria until that country was released from occupation in the mid-1950s.

The French First Army reverted to the control of the provisional French government shortly after the surrender of Germany.

Devers relinquished command of the Sixth Army Group in late June 1945 when he was selected to take command of the Army Ground Forces in lieu of General Joseph Stilwell who was reassigned as commander of the Tenth United States Army following the death of General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.

The Sixth Army Group was officially inactivated on 20 July 1945.

==Order of battle – 8 May 1945==

Order of battle shifted frequently in the Sixth Army Group, but accelerated dramatically during its late-war push through southern Bavaria into the Austrian Alps to head off German establishment of a National Redoubt and close off passes to Nazi escape. Order of Battle on 8 May represents a significantly different disposition in some instances than in the weeks and even days leading up to it.

<doc id="481452" wikidata="Q740991" url="?curid=481452" title="Oisc of Kent">
<text>Oisc (early Old English or ), or, in a later spelling, Ēsc () was, if he existed, an early king of Kent and, according to Bede, the eponymous founder of the tribe known as &quot;Oiscingas&quot; (early Old English .

==Etymology and spellings==
Most scholars agree that, like many names in the Germanic languages, the root of the name &quot;Oisc&quot; is an Old English word &quot;ōs&quot;, meaning &#x27;(non-Christian) god&#x27;, cognate with Old Norse &quot;Áss&quot; (deriving from Proto-Germanic &#x27;). The etymology of the name has been studied most thoroughly by John Insley, who concluded that cognate forms of the name &quot;Oisc&quot; are found in Old Saxon (&quot;Ōsic&quot;, alongside the corresponding weak noun &quot;Ōsica&quot;), to which later scholarship possibly adds the runic inscription on a shield boss dating from between 150 and 220 CE found on Thorsberg moor in Schleswig-Holstein which in 2015 Lisbeth M. Imer interpreted as a Roman-influenced maker&#x27;s mark reading aṇsgz h&quot;&#x27;.

In Insley&#x27;s interpretation, in &quot;Oisc&quot; the &quot;ōs&quot; element is combined with a suffix which in Proto-Germanic took the form *, which in this context had a diminutive function. The name was thus a hypocoristic (nickname) form of longer dithematic names beginning in &quot;Ōs&quot;- such as &quot;Ōswald&quot; and &quot;Ōsrīc&quot;. In this reading, the phonetic development of the name from Proto-Germanic to early Old English was * =&gt; * (by the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law) =&gt; (by i-mutation) =&gt; (by high vowel loss and apocope). This form was represented graphically in early Old English as &quot;Oisc&quot; and &quot;Oesc&quot;. Later in Old English, the vowel developed to , giving the spelling &quot;Ēsc&quot;.

Bernard Mees, however, has suggested that &quot;Oisc&quot; and its cognates come from the Germanic root &quot;&quot; found in, for example, the Old Norse verb (&#x27;to breathe&#x27;), combined with the suffix ; other adjectives formed with this suffix generally mean something like &#x27;quick, lively, brave&#x27;.

=== Mis-spellings ===
The name is also found in a couple of West Saxon sources as &quot;Æsc&quot; (along with the tribal name &quot;Æscingas&quot;). Insley interprets these spellings as etymologically incorrect attempts by later Old English-speakers to update the then unfamiliar word &quot;Oisc&quot; into their variety of the language, influenced by the familiar name-element &quot;Æsc&quot;-. An early modern transcription of the early medieval manuscript London, British Library, Cotton Otho B. xi by Laurence Nowell gives not the name &quot;Oeric&quot; and &quot;Oisc&quot; as found in Bede, but &quot;ósric&quot; and &quot;oese&quot;, but Insley concluded that these are merely inaccurate transcriptions.

==Portrayal in the early sources==
Little is known about Oisc, and the information that does survive regarding his life is often vague and suspect.

Anglo-Saxon king-lists generally present Oisc as the son or the grandson of Hengest, who according to other sources led the initial Anglo-Saxon conquest and settlement of Kent.

According to Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, Oisc&#x27;s given name was Oeric. Bede indicates that he was the son of Hengest and travelled to Britain with him, with the permission of the British king Vortigern. He was the father of Octa, who succeeded him. His descendants called themselves &quot;Oiscingas&quot; after him.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which in its present form was compiled by people who knew Bede&#x27;s account, portrays Oisc as ruling 488–512CE.

=== Possible portrayal in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; ===
Oisc has been widely viewed the same person as one Ansehis, who is described as a leader of the Saxon invaders of Britain in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;. This says that &quot;in oceano vero occidentale est insula quae dicitur Britania, ubi olim gens Saxonum veniens ab antiqua Saxonia cum principe suo nomine Ansehis modo habitare videtur&quot; (indeed in the western ocean is an island which is called &quot;Britania&quot;, which the people of the Saxons, coming from Old Saxony under their chief, named &quot;Ansehis&quot;, seem now to inhabit&quot;. &quot;Ansehis&quot; (or, as some manuscripts have it, &quot;Ansehys&quot;) is plausibly an error for &quot;Anschis&quot;, which would be a plausible archaic or Continental Germanic form of Oisc&#x27;s name. However, Insley has argued that an older idea, that &quot;Anschis&quot; would also be a plausible attempt to represent proto-Old English *&quot;Hangista&quot;-, is more plausible, and that it is Hengest whom the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; represents.

<doc id="481454" wikidata="Q2703383" url="?curid=481454" title="Twelfth United States Army Group">
<text>The Twelfth United States [[Army group|Army Group]] was the largest and most powerful United States Army formation ever to take to the field, commanding four field armies at its peak in 1945: First United States Army, Third United States Army, Ninth United States Army, and Fifteenth United States Army. The order of battle across the four armies comprised 12 corps, containing a total of 48 divisions. Formed eight days after the Normandy landings, it initially controlled the First and the Third US Armies. Through various configurations in 1944 and 1945, the Twelfth US Army Group controlled the majority of American forces on the Western Front. It was commanded by General Omar Bradley with its headquarters established in London on 14 July 1944.

During the first week of the Normandy landings and the Battle of Normandy, Bradley&#x27;s First US Army formed the right wing of the Allied lines. They were joined during July by the Third US Army, under the command of General George S. Patton, to form the Twelfth Army Group. Twelfth Army Group became operational in France on 1 August 1944. With General Omar Bradley assuming command of the Twelfth Army Group, Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges assumed command of the First Army. In addition, the USAAF&#x27;s Ninth Air Force (not included in the 1.3 million soldiers figure) was attached to support the field armies of the Twelfth Army Group.

Until 1 September 1944, when General Dwight D. Eisenhower assumed overall command of the Allied land forces in Northwest Europe, the US forces in Normandy were included with the British Second Army and the First Canadian Army in the British headquarters formation 21st Army Group, commanded by General Bernard Montgomery.

After the breakout from the beach-head at Normandy, the Twelfth Army Group formed the center of the Allied forces on the Western Front. To the north was the British 21st Army Group (the First Canadian and British Second) and, to the south, advancing from their landing on the Mediterranean coast, was the Sixth United States Army Group (Seventh United States Army and French First Army).

As the Twelfth advanced through Germany in 1945, it grew to control four United States field armies: the First, the Third, the Ninth and the Fifteenth. By V-E Day, the Twelfth Army Group was a force that numbered over 1.3 million men.

Twelfth Army Group was inactivated on 12 July 1945 upon Bradley&#x27;s departure to become Director of the Veterans Administration. Its subordinate elements then became directly subordinate to United States Army Europe.

<doc id="481459" wikidata="Q192452" url="?curid=481459" title="Expo 2010">
<text>Expo 2010, officially the Expo 2010 Shanghai China, was held on both banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010. It was a major World Expo registered by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), in the tradition of international fairs and expositions, the first since 2005. The theme of the exposition was &quot;Better City – Better Life&quot; and signifies Shanghai&#x27;s new status in the 21st century as the &quot;next great world city&quot;. The Expo emblem features the Chinese character (&#x27;world&#x27;, Chinese &quot;shì&quot;) modified to represent three people together with the 2010 date. It had the largest number of countries participating and was the most expensive Expo in the history of the world&#x27;s fairs. The Shanghai World Expo was also the largest World&#x27;s Fair site ever at 5.28 square km.

By the end of the expo, over 73 million people had visited – a record attendance – and 246 countries and international organizations had participated. On 16 October 2010, the expo set a single-day record of over 1.03 million visitors.

==History==

===Early participation and hosting===
Shanghai has been one of the main cities envisioned to host the expos for some time. Many scholars have written about the possibility and made suggestions in books. Unofficial participation in fairs outside China have happened since 1851. In 1910, the Qing dynasty decided to host China&#x27;s first fair with the Nanyang industrial exposition.

===Selection process===
Shanghai scored the highest in each of the four rounds of voting at the 132nd Meeting of the Bureau of International Expositions in Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco, with Yeosu, South Korea maintaining second place. Yeosu later won the bid to host Expo 2012, a three-month specialized world expo.
==Organization==

In 2004, the Chinese central government established the Shanghai World Expo Organising Committee as the organization dedicated to host the event. The Organising Committee set up an executive committee which is responsible for the execution and management of expo affairs. Besides, the Shanghai World Expo Coordination is founded for the daily affairs of the executive committee.

The site of the event was the Nanpu Bridge–Lupu Bridge region in the center of Shanghai along both sides of the Huangpu River. The area of the Expo 2010 covers 5.28 km2.

After winning the bid to host the Expo in 2002, Shanghai began a monumental task to reshape the city. More than $48 billion was spent for the preparation, more than the cost of cleaning up Beijing in the preparations for the Olympics in 2008. Shanghai began clearing 2.6 square kilometres along the Huangpu River; that involved moving 18,000 families and 270 factories, including the Jiang Nan Shipyard, which employs 10,000 workers.

Six new subway lines were opened between 2008 and 2010; four thousand brand new taxis were added in the month before Expo 2010 opened and the city&#x27;s buildings along the river were decorated with more energy-efficient LEDs.

During the expo, the expo site was crowded with national pavilions, sculpture gardens, shops, a sports arena and clam-shaped performing arts centre.

Shanghai trained more than 1.7 million volunteers and adopted Olympic-level security measures, adding metal detectors to subway entrances and screening cars entering the city.

The Shanghai Expo also featured an online version of the expo grounds featuring 3D renderings of the expo grounds, and a 3D version of the pavilion interior and offerings.

==Participation==

The Shanghai World Expo provided an unparalleled opportunity for the tourism industry. During 2010&#x27;s Spring Festival, Shanghai received 2.79 million tourists, an increase of 12 percent from the previous year, resulting in record high numbers of visitors. Overall Shanghai&#x27;s tourism revenue achieved an increase of 13 percent year on year during Spring Festival, resulting in RMB 2.1 billion in total revenue.


192 countries and 50 organizations registered to participate in the Shanghai World Expo, a record number for that time.

==Attendance==
Over 73 million people visited Expo 2010 during the 184-day event, breaking the previous record of 64 million visitors set by Expo 70 in Osaka. Organizers had expected 70 million visitors at the start of the expo. About 5.8 percent of the visitors, or 4.25 million, were foreigners.

==Finances==
Shanghai spent 11.964 billion yuan in operating cost to host the event, making it the most expensive World Expo ever, but the organizers still made an operating profit of more than 1 billion yuan (US$157 million) thanks to the record attendance. The total revenue was 13.014 billion yuan, including 7.36 billion yuan in admission fees and almost 4 billion yuan in sponsorship income. However, the city invested another 19.74 billion yuan to prepare and construct the 5.28 square kilometer site, exceeding the budget of 18 billion yuan.

==Opening ceremony==


The opening ceremony was held in the evening of 30 April 2010 attended by dozens of world leaders. The ceremony consisted of an indoor and outdoor component. Jackie Chan, Lang Lang, and Andrea Bocelli were among the performers in the indoor component. The event featured an outdoor display of fireworks, lasers, and dancing fountains after a performance by singers and dancers. The outdoor ceremony was produced by David Atkins Enterprises. 6,000 LED balls were floated into the Huangpu River representing fish. Organisers called the outdoor show &quot;the largest searchlight display in history, the largest collection of multi-coloured laser firepower ever assembled in one place, the world&#x27;s largest LED screen, one of the largest dancing water fountains ever, and the &quot;largest light show ever attempted&quot;.&quot; President Hu Jintao inaugurated the opening of the Shanghai World Expo.

==Closing ceremony==
The closing ceremony was held on 31 October 2010, with numerous world leaders in attendance including Wen Jiabao, Prime Minister of China, Sri Lanka&#x27;s President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, Mari Kiviniemi, Prime Minister of Finland, Hubert Ingraham, Prime Minister of Bahamas, Pakalitha Mosisili, Prime Minister of Lesotho, Ram Baran Yadav, President of Nepal and Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations.

==Expo music==

===Performances===
About 20,000 performances were set to be staged between 1 May and 31 October in 2010, many singers present at the expo song writing and preparation process since 2008. Performers included Alan Tam, Gigi Leung, Stephanie Cheng, Khalil Fong, Hacken Lee, Denise Ho, Hins Cheung, Vincy Chan, Philadelphia Boys Choir, National Boys Choir of Australia, Salut Salon, the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland and the Harvard Din &amp; Tonics, and others.

===Theme songs===
*The official theme songs of the Expo were &quot;City&quot; by Jackie Chan and &quot;Better City, Better Life&quot; by Quincy Jones.
*The promotional song of the Expo was &quot;Right Here Waiting for You 2010&quot; (). Released during the 30-day countdown on 1 April, Right Here Waiting for You 2010 was plagiarized from the 1997 Japanese song &quot;Sonomama no Kimi de Ite&quot; (&quot;Stay the Way You Are&quot;) by Mayo Okamoto. This resulted in its use as the Expo theme being suspended. After discussions with Okamoto&#x27;s management, a compromise was reached such that &quot;Sonomama no Kimi de Ite&quot; is now the official song of the 2010 Expo
*The theme song for Shanghai World Expo volunteers was &quot;By Your Side&quot; () by Eason Chan.
*The theme song for the Shanghai World Expo for the Chinese culture was &quot;The World Watching China&quot;, sung by Chinese singer Han Geng.
*The theme song for Norway was &quot;Powered By Nature&quot; which was composed by Rolf Løvland and performed by his group Secret Garden. The song was recorded for their 2011 album &quot;Winter Poem&quot;.

==Mascot==

Haibao was the mascot of the Shanghai Expo 2010. It means treasure of the sea and was based on the Chinese character for man or person, &quot;人&quot;. Some said that Haibao resembles Gumby, but the expo&#x27;s secretariat said that it was an original design chosen through a competition and that they had never heard of Gumby.

==Expo Axis==

The main building – called &quot;Expo Axis&quot; – has the world&#x27;s largest membrane construction and was built by SBA (architects) and Knippers Helbig (structural engineers). The building consists of some steel-glass funnels with a long membrane construction. The main construction was completed at the end of 2009.

Rotterdam and

==Legacy==
The Expo introduced numerous urban best practices and concepts from all over the world which the organisers hope will be a lasting legacy for better urban life in China and around the world. It advocated for future development to focus on environmental sustainability, efficiency and diversity. The innovations and achievements of the event were summarised in the Shanghai Declaration issued by the participants of the Expo. The declaration also nominated the Shanghai Expo&#x27;s closing day 31 October as &quot;World Better Cities Day&quot;. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the closing of the Expo, &quot;Thanks to this Expo, millions of people learned about possibilities for making our cities healthier and safer, cities that better integrate nature and technology, cities that offer their citizens cleaner air and water, and better lives all around&quot;.

Within Shanghai, the grounds of the former Expo site now constitute the Expo Park, including the former China Pavilion. The Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) and the Shanghai government have announced plans to construct the world&#x27;s only official World Expo Museum in Shanghai, on the Puxi side of the expo site. Construction began in 2012, and the museum opened its doors on 1 May 2017. More than 200 participants from Expo 2010 have donated over 30,000 exhibits to the future museum. The BIE has added into its formal requirements that all future Expo bidders shall support the new Expo Museum.

The Shanghai Expo was touted by the Chinese government as yet another first-rate global scale event, similar in significance to the Beijing Olympics, which would symbolise the economic and political rise of China in the 21st century. The event would demonstrate to both the Chinese populace and foreign nations the enormous progress of China&#x27;s urban development in the heart of the nation&#x27;s economic hub of Shanghai. The event received extensive media coverage in the Chinese media both in the lead up and during the World Expo. According to China analyst Tom Doctoroff, &quot;In terms of what the city was able to achieve, the Chinese were impressed. Shanghai stepped up a level in internationalization&quot;. Outside China, the Expo propelled Shanghai onto magazine covers, newspaper front pages and television programmes at a time when it is laying the groundwork to become an international financial centre by 2020.

==Controversies==
A group of NGOs protested a month before the expo against the alleged displacement of 18,000 families in the Shanghai area in connection with the Expo. Dissident Feng Zhenghu was detained in mid April 2010 for threatening to publicly seek redress for them in the courts. According to the U.S. government-run Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Shanghai authorities used the expo as an excuse to conduct a surveillance, propaganda, and detention campaign against members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group.

Denmark controversially sent the original Little Mermaid statue from Copenhagen to the expo, putting a video replica recorded by dissident Ai Weiwei in its place. Some observers criticized the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office&#x27;s payment for the 9 Hong Kong undersecretaries to inspect infrastructure projects and hold discussions on city-to-city cooperation. Six legislators from the pro-democracy camp boycotted an invitation to the expo by the Shanghai government because of the issue of political reform and the 2010 Hong Kong by-election. The Chinese government postponed the planned visit of 1,000 Japanese youths to the expo in September because of the 2010 Senkaku boat collision incident, which Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan called regrettable.

State employees were given free one-day vouchers to the expo, and according to one worker, threatened with wage cuts, in order to fulfill the target of 70 million visitors. Long lines at the Germany pavilion caused visitors to shout &quot;Nazi, Nazi&quot; and attack workers, according to general commissioner for Germany&#x27;s pavilion Dietmar Schmitz. Free tickets to an expo show featuring K-pop group Super Junior caused a stampede that injured 100 people, which spokespersons for the expo and the Korean pavilion allegedly denied.

<doc id="481466" wikidata="Q1950176" url="?curid=481466" title="Motława">
<text>The Motława (; ) is a river in Eastern Pomerania in Poland. Its source is in Szpęgawskie Lake, northeast from the town of Starogard Gdański. The Motlawa goes through Rokickie Lake to Martwa Wisła, a branch of the Vistula. The total length of the river is estimated at 68 km, and its drainage basin is 1511.3 km2.

The city of Gdańsk is situated at its mouth in the Martwa Wisła. In Gdańsk, the Motława ferry crosses the river, a service that has run since the year 1687.

The Polish name &quot;Motława&quot; is derived from Old Prussian language. In German the river is known as &quot;Mottlau&quot;.

A common theory for the etymology of the cities Gdańsk and Gdynia is that they are named after an older Polish and Kashubian name for the river, &quot;Gdania&quot;.

The Motława flows through the following municipalities: Starogard Gdański, Tczew, Suchy Dąb, Pruszcz Gdański, and the city of Gdańsk.

<doc id="481468" wikidata="Q10302023" url="?curid=481468" title="Industrialization of Sweden">
<text>The industrialization of Sweden began during the second half of the nineteenth century. The industrial breakthrough occurred in the 1870s during the international boom period, and it carried on through the decades in response to the growing demand of the home market. By the end of this period, the first multinational companies based on advanced technology had emerged.

During the early phase of World War I in which Sweden remained neutral, the country benefited from increasing demand. However, with the German submarine war, Sweden was cut off from its markets, which led to a severe economic downturn. Between the world wars, major Swedish exports were steel, ball-bearings, wood pulp, and matches. Prosperity after World War II provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden.

Foreign policy concerns in the 1930s centred on Soviet and German expansionism, which stimulated abortive efforts at Nordic defence co-operation.

In 2016, the Swedish government reported that the industrial and industrial-services sectors accounted for 77 per cent of the country&#x27;s exports, equivalent to almost 50 per cent of the total gross domestic product (GDP).

==Early 19th century==
In the early 1800s, Sweden&#x27;s economy was predominantly rural and agricultural. However, the country&#x27;s rich natural resources, particularly in iron ore, timber, and waterpower, provided the foundation for future industrial development. By the mid-19th century, Sweden&#x27;s agricultural sector had begun to modernize, leading to a surplus in food production, which in turn supported population growth. This, coupled with increased urbanization, paved the way for the rise of industrial activity.

==Urbanization==
 Industrialization brought rapid urbanization, with thousands of people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of work. Cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö grew rapidly as they became industrial hubs. The working conditions in factories, however, were often harsh, leading to the rise of labor movements. Swedish workers organized into unions and demanded better wages, working hours, and conditions. This culminated in the formation of powerful labor organizations such as the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) in 1898 which played a key role in advocating for labor rights.

The rise of social democratic movements during the late 19th century, aligned with the growing labor force, contributed to significant political reforms. By the early 20th century, Sweden had begun to implement labor protections, including workplace safety regulations and limits on working hours.

===Communications===

The mainline railways (), built and owned by the State, were of major importance for the development of Swedish industry and economy in general.

The two first main line railways, were the Southern Main Line, stretching from Stockholm to Malmö in the south, and the Western Main Line, from Stockholm to Gothenburg on the west coast. They were completed between 1860 and 1864. The Northern railways (East Coast Line, Northern Main Line &amp; Main Line Through Upper Norrland) runs parallel to the Baltic coast up to Boden, in northern Sweden, and was finished in 1894. The Inland Line runs through the central parts of northern Sweden and was built between 1908 and 1937.

The construction of the early main lines provided a fast and safe connection from the mines in the north to the rest of Sweden. It also facilitated business (and private) travel, that had earlier required horse-driven carriages.

The Iron Ore Line (not a main line), from Luleå to Narvik in Norway, provided a highly efficient transportation linkage from the iron ores near Kiruna and Gällivare to harbours on both the Atlantic and the Baltic coasts. The sections of the Iron Ore Line were completed in stages between 1888 and 1903.

==Growth of key industries==
By the late 19th century, Sweden saw the rise of major industries and companies. Steel production became increasingly important as new technologies like the Bessemer process were introduced, allowing Sweden to refine its iron ore into high-quality steel, which became a key export. Companies like SKF, a leading producer of ball bearings, and ASEA (now ABB), specializing in electrical equipment, were founded during this time and played a vital role in Sweden&#x27;s industrial landscape.

<doc id="481472" wikidata="Q879927" url="?curid=481472" title="Eadric of Kent">
<text>Eadric (died August 686/ 687?) was a King of Kent (685–686). He was the son of Ecgberht I.

==Historical context==

In the 7th century the Kingdom of Kent had been politically stable for some time. According to Bede:

Eorcenberht was succeeded by his sons Ecgberht (664-673) and Hlothhere (673-685). Ecgberht&#x27;s court seems to have had many diplomatic and ecclesiastic contacts. He hosted Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop, and provided escorts to Archbishop Theodore and Abbot Adrian of Canterbury for their travels in Gaul. However, increasing dynastic tensions occurred at this time, when according to tradition Ecgberht had his cousins Æthelred and Æthelberht murdered, effectively removing them as they had a strong claim on the throne.



==Joint ruler of Kent?==
Hlothhere succeeded his brother as ruler of Kent in 673. It was not unusual for Kent to be divided between rulers at that time. However although there has been some suggestion that Eadric jointly ruled with his uncle Hlothhere, there is no certain evidence for it. The Law of Hlothhere and Eadric is a single law code that was issued in the name of Hlothhere and Eadric as joint rulers of Kent, but it may just have been a conflation of two earlier separate codes.

In 679 Hlothhere granted land in Thanet to Beorhtwald, abbot of Reculver. In the charter document there is a statement noting the agreement of Archbishop Theodore and &quot;Eadric, son of my brother&quot;. 

==Sole ruler==
The charter of 679 implies that, at that date, the relationship between Eadric and his uncle were not unfriendly, however in about 685 Eadric revolted against his uncle. With help from Æthelwealh of Sussex he raised a South Saxon army and defeated Hlothhere in battle. Hlothhere died of his wounds shortly after and Eadric became sole ruler of Kent. 

Eadric was a nephew of Wulfhere of Mercia. Wulfhere was in an alliance with the South Saxons, so it would have served the politics of the time for Æthelwealh to support Eadric&#x27;s coup against Hlothhere.

==Invaded by Wessex==
Also, in 685 a West Saxon warband invaded Sussex under the command of the Wessex prince Cædwalla and killed Æthelwealh. Cædwalla was subsequently driven out of Sussex by two of Æthelwealh&#x27;s ealdormen, Berhthun and Andhun.
William of Malmesbury suggests that Eadric became king of the South Saxon kingdom at that time. Then in 686, Cædwalla, now king of Wessex, and his brother Mul, removed Eadric from power and made Mul king of Kent. 

There is a discussion on the actual date of Eadric&#x27;s death.
Bede lists his death, but does not provide a precise date, however one of the Kent annals, suggest that he was buried on 31 August 686 and another 31 August 687.

<doc id="481473" wikidata="Q81114" url="?curid=481473" title="Jean de Lattre de Tassigny">
<text>Jean Joseph Marie Gabriel de Lattre de Tassigny (2 February 1889 – 11 January 1952) was a French &quot;général d&#x27;armée&quot; during World War II and the First Indochina War. He was posthumously elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France in 1952.

As an officer during World War I, he fought in various battles, including at Verdun, and was wounded five times, surviving the war with eight citations, the Legion of Honour, and the Military Cross. During the Interwar period, he took part in the Rif War in Morocco, where he was again wounded in action. He went on to serve in the Ministry of War and the staff of &quot;Conseil supérieur de la guerre&quot; under the vice president &quot;Général d&#x27;armée&quot; Maxime Weygand.

Early in World War II, from May to June 1940, he was the youngest French general. He led the 14th Infantry Division during the Battle of France in the battles of Rethel, Champagne-Ardenne, and Loire, until the Armistice of 22 June 1940. During the Vichy Regime he remained in the Armistice Army, first in regional command posts then as commander-in-chief of troops in Tunisia. After the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 the Germans invaded the unoccupied portion of France; de Lattre, Commander of the 16th Military Division at Montpellier, refused the orders not to fight the Germans and was the only active general to order his troops to oppose the invaders. He was arrested but escaped and defected to Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces at the end of 1943. From 1943 to 1945 he was one of the senior leaders of the Liberation Army, commanding the forces that landed in the South of France on 15 August 1944, then fought up to the Rivers Rhine and Danube. He commanded large numbers of American troops when the US XXI Corps was assigned to his First Army during the battle of the Colmar Pocket. He was also the French representative at the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin on 8 May 1945.

He became Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in Germany in 1945, then Inspector General and Chief of Staff of the French Army. In March 1947 he became the vice-president of the &quot;Conseil supérieur de la guerre&quot;. From 1948 to 1950 he served as Commander-in-chief of the Western Union&#x27;s ground forces. In 1951 he was the High Commissioner, commander-in-chief in Indochina and commander-in-chief of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, winning several battles against the Việt Minh. His only son was killed there, and then illness forced him to return to Paris where he died of cancer in 1952. He was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France posthumously in 1952 during his state funeral.

== Early life ==
Jean Joseph Marie Gabriel de Lattre de Tassigny was born on 2 February 1889 in Mouilleron-en-Pareds, Vendée, in the same village as World War I leader Georges Clemenceau. He was the son of Roger de Lattre de Tassigny and Anne-Marie Louise Henault, the daughter of the mayor of Mouilleron. Her grandfather had been his predecessor, assuming the office in 1817. In turn, Roger de Lattre succeeded his father-in-law as mayor in 1911, and still held the office forty years later. An ancestor had added the suffix &quot;de Tassigny&quot; to the family name in 1740, after the family property of Tassigny near Guise. He had an older sister, Anne-Marie, who later became the Comtesse de Marcé.

From 1898 to 1904 de Lattre attended the College of Saint-Joseph in Poitiers, where his father had gone. He then decided that he would join the Navy, and to prepare he went to the College de Vaugirard, where Henri de Gaulle was a teacher. He passed the written examinations for the Navy but missed the oral examination owing to illness. He then went to the at Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève in Versailles to prepare for the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, where he won a place in 1908. Before he entered, his father sent him to Brighton in England to improve his English. As was the custom in the French Army, he also served in the ranks for four months, in his case, with the at Provins, south east of Paris. He was a cadet at Saint-Cyr from 1909 to 1911 (&quot;Mauritanie&quot; promotion). One instructor expressed the hope that de Lattre was not related to the one who had raised the white flag of Henri, Count of Chambord over Saint-Cyr in 1873. This was his uncle, and henceforth de Lattre refused to have anything to do with the instructor. He ultimately graduated 201st out of 210 in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 1 October 1910. He then went on to the Saumur Cavalry School.

== First World War ==

De Lattre was assigned to the , which was stationed at Toul and Pont-à-Mousson near the frontier with Germany and still wore red riding breeches and a helmet with a plume. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 October 1912. He was still serving there when the First World War broke out in August 1914. On 11 August 1914, he was wounded for the first time when he was hit in the knee by a shell fragment during a reconnaissance mission. On 14 September, he was wounded a second time, in an engagement with four Bavarian Uhlans during which he killed two with his sword, but a third struck him in the chest with a lance, perforating his lung. His troop sergeant took him to a cellar in Pont-à-Mousson, where they hid from German patrols until one from the 5th Hussar Regiment reached them. He received the Legion of Honour on 20 December 1914.

In 1915, de Lattre responded to an appeal for cavalry officers to volunteer for service in the infantry, and he joined a Vendée regiment, the . He was promoted to captain on 18 December 1915, and was a company commander and then assistant battalion commander in its 3rd Battalion. As part of the 21st Infantry Division, the 93rd Infantry Regiment fought in the Battle of Verdun, where he was gassed in July 1916. The mustard gas affected his injured lung, necessitating time in hospital. He was back with the 21st Infantry Division in time to participate in the ill-fated Nivelle offensive in April 1917. In an attack on 5 May, his battalion suffered 300 casualties, but captured 500 prisoners. De Lattre received his eighth mention in despatches. He was hospitalised again that month, and did not return until December, when he became an intelligence officer on the 21st Infantry Division staff. The division was decimated in the Third Battle of the Aisne in May 1918, but it was reconstituted and fought in the Meuse-Argonne offensive later that year, during which de Lattre liaised with the staffs of three divisions of the United States Army.

== Between the wars ==
In February 1919, de Lattre was assigned to the 18th Military District section at Bordeaux, where his duties included providing recreation for American troops prior to their repatriation. At the end of the year he joined the , which was stationed at Bayonne. From 1921 to 1926, he was in Morocco, where he participated in the campaigns of the Rif War. He became the head of the Third Bureau (the staff section responsible for operations) of the Meknes area, and directed operations in Upper Moulouya. These normally involved two or more columns, each with between four and eight battalions of infantry and attached artillery and transport, converging on a locality. The following year operations moved on to the rugged Taza Province. De Lattre was critical of the tactics used by Marshal Philippe Pétain, which he regarded as slow, expensive and materialistic. He was slashed in the right cheek by an assailant wielding a dagger on 13 March 1924, resulting in a prominent scar, and he was wounded in the knee by a bullet on 26 August 1925 during a reconnaissance mission. He was promoted to the rank of &quot;chef de bataillon&quot; (commandant) on 25 June 1926.

De Lattre returned to France, where he spent several weeks with his parents at Mouilleron-en-Pareds. At a luncheon given by a deputy for Vendée, he met , the nineteen-year-old daughter of a Paris deputy. They met again at a party on the Île d&#x27;Yeu, an island off the Vendée coast. They were married on 22 March 1927, at Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot in Paris. They had one child, Bernard de Lattre de Tassigny, who was born on 11 February 1928. (Driving with him on his daily tour of inspection in January 1945, the seventeen-year-old John Julius Norwich recalled: &quot;I did have a little trouble keeping his hand off my thigh in the car on the way home...but nothing serious.&quot;)

De Lattre commanded a battalion of the 4th Infantry Regiment, which was stationed at Auxerre, and prepared for the entrance examination for the École de guerre, coached by Captain Augustin Guillaume, an officer he had met while serving in Morocco. He managed to pass the examinations, and entered the École de guerre as the senior officer of his year. One of the staff exercises involved command of an invading force tasked with capturing Cherbourg from the sea. After graduation in 1928, he was assigned to the at Coulommiers as a battalion commander.

In 1931, de Lattre was assigned to the 4th Bureau of the Ministry of War, responsible for logistics. He was promoted to on 24 March 1932. On 20 June, he joined the staff of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre, serving under the vice president, Général d&#x27;armée Maxime Weygand. During this posting, he was tasked mainly with following foreign international policies, internal politics, and the challenges of complex military budget initiatives. He became embroiled in the Stavisky affair and had to appear before a parliamentary commission. With the retirement of Weygand, who had reached mandatory retirement age, de Lattre was retained on the general headquarters staff of Général Alphonse Joseph Georges. On 20 June 1935, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the at Metz. Between 1937 and 1938, he studied at the Centre des hautes études militaires (CHEM), an advanced staff college for generals. In July 1938 he became Chief of Staff at the headquarters of the military governor of Strasbourg, Général d&#x27;armée . Hering retired in March 1939, and was succeeded by Général d&#x27;armée Victor Bourret. On 20 March, de Lattre was promoted to général de brigade.

== World War II ==
=== Battle of France ===

De Lattre became the chief of staff at general headquarters of the Fifth Army on 2 September 1939. The following day France declared war on Germany again. In January 1940, he was given command of the 14th Infantry Division, which was holding the sector between Sarreguemines and Forbach. On 14 May, four days after the main German offensive began, the 14th Infantry Division was ordered to move to Rheims, where it came under the command of André Corap&#x27;s Ninth Army. 

De Lattre engaged the German forces around Rethel, where his division resisted for an entire month, repelling German assaults in front of the River Aisne. On 9 June, the German Twelfth Army launched a major assault on the 14th Infantry Division&#x27;s positions. Although it managed to hold on, the divisions on its flanks could not, and de Lattre was forced to retreat to the Marne, and then the Loire. Part of his division was cut off at Chalons. Although it lost about two-thirds of its strength, the division retained its cohesion in the midst of chaos. When the Armistice of 22 June 1940 ended the fighting, the 14th Infantry Division was at Clermont-Ferrand.

=== Army of Vichy ===
Following the armistice de Lattre remained in the Army of Vichy France. He was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 12 July for his handling of the 14th Infantry Division in the Battle of France, an award Weygand, to whom he remained loyal, conferred on him in person. De Lattre was appointed to command the 13th Military Division, the military district at Puy-de-Dôme in the Massif Central, where he established a training centre for officers and non-commissioned officers at Château d&#x27;Opme. He was promoted to général de division on 26 June 1941.

In September 1941 Weygand, now the Delegate-General of The Vichy government in North Africa, summoned de Lattre to North Africa as the commander-in-chief of troops in the protectorate of Tunisia. De Lattre opened another military instruction centre there at Salammbô near Carthage, modelled on the one at Opme. He clashed with his superior, Général de Corps d&#x27;Armée Alphonse Juin, over the best way to defend Tunisia against a British attack. De Lattre was determined to resist on the frontier, fearing that a fighting withdrawal might lead to the Germans and Italians occupying Vichy France; Juin, a native of North Africa, was more concerned with the security of Algeria. De Lattre may have also hoped that he would have been appointed head of the French forces in North Africa instead of Juin. Nonetheless Juin recommended de Lattre for promotion. He was promoted to général de corps d&#x27;armée on 2 January 1942, but Weygand had been recalled to France in October 1941, and on 2 February 1942 de Lattre was also recalled.

Returning to France, de Lattre took charge of the 16th Military Division, based in Montpellier. The post was a backwater, and one usually held by an officer of lower rank. Following the Allied landings in French North Africa on 8 November 1942, German and Italian troops occupied southern France and disbanded the Vichy Army. De Lattre received orders from Vichy that troops were to remain in their barracks, which he decided to disobey, instead carrying out a previously prepared plan to resist the German occupation. Staff officers informed de Lattre&#x27;s superior in Avignon of his intentions. The troops did not move, and the Vichy Minister of War, Eugène Bridoux, ordered de Lattre&#x27;s arrest. He was brought before a special State Tribunal on 9 January 1943, charged with treason and abandoning his post. The former charge was dropped but he was found guilty of the latter and was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment.

De Lattre was initially held at Montluc prison, but was later transferred to Riom. Simonne secured accommodation where the garden adjoined the prison wall and worked with de Lattre&#x27;s driver, Louis Roetsch, and accomplices inside the prison to plan an escape. They managed to smuggle in tools, including a hammer, screwdriver and gimlet, along with paint, a paintbrush, putty and a rope. De Lattre had noticed that the sentry underneath his window went to wake up his relief in the middle of the night instead of being relieved in place, leaving the window unguarded for up to ten minutes. He also found that with one of the bars on his window removed he was able to squeeze through. On the night of 1 September 1943 he removed the window frame and one bar, squeezed through, and used the rope to descend, although it proved to be several feet too short. Bernard threw a rope ladder over the prison wall, allowing de Lattre to scale it. They then departed in two cars that Roetsch provided, along with false papers identifying de Lattre as Charles Dequenne, his headquarters clerk who had been killed in the fighting in June 1940. They hid on a farm near Compains until 1 October, when some of his prison break accomplices were arrested. De Lattre then made his way to a field near Pont-de-Vaux, whence he and others, including Eugène Claudius-Petit, were whisked away by a British aircraft and taken to London. Simonne and Bernard moved to Paris, where they lived under false names.

=== Operation Dragoon ===
De Lattre was promoted to the rank of général d&#x27;armée by Général de brigade Charles de Gaulle on 11 November 1943. Problems with his damaged lung led to de Lattre being admitted to Middlesex Hospital. He was discharged from hospital on 11 December, and on 19 December he flew from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to Algiers, where he met with de Gaulle. He then went to see the Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in North Africa, Général d&#x27;Armée Henri Giraud. On 26 December, Giraud appointed him the commander of the Second Army, which was renamed Army B on 23 January 1944. This put him in change of all the forces in North Africa being re-equipped by the Americans. Army B was as an amalgam of Free French forces, the Army of Africa forces and volunteers, with a strength of 256,000, including 5,000 women of the AFAT ( – Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Army). In the first half of 1944 over 100,000 personnel departed for Italy, where they formed the French Expeditionary Corps (CEF) under Juin&#x27;s command. This left de Lattre with just three divisions. Once again, he opened a cadre training centre, this time at Douéra in Algiers. His manner at this time gave rise to the sobriquet (King John).
On 17 April 1944, de Gaulle informed General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson&#x27;s Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) in Algiers that de Lattre would be in command of all French forces participating in Operation Anvil, the projected Allied landings in Southern France. He was also placed in charge of Operation Brassard, the invasion of Elba. This involved landing a force of about 12,000 under Général de brigade Joseph Magnan, and largely drawn from his 9th Colonial Infantry Division on Corsica. Increases in the size of the German garrison, a need to provide more amphibious warfare training for the assault troops, and a desire to minimise casualties and maximise the chance of success led to de Lattre securing a postponement of the operation from 25 May to 17 June. The rapid advance of the Allied forces, which captured Rome on 5 June, caused the need for the operation to be questioned, but the Germans showed no sign of immediately withdrawing from the area north of Rome, nor from Elba. Operation Brassard therefore went ahead, although Wilson cancelled the planned parachute assault by the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment, as the required transport aircraft were committed to the Italian campaign. Operation Brassard was successful, liberating the island in two days of hard fighting between 17 and 19 June.

As commander of Army B, de Lattre assisted in the preparations for Operation Anvil, which was renamed Operation Dragoon on 1 August 1944. He was successful in securing Allied agreement for an independent French command, although the II Corps, under Général de corps d&#x27;armée Edgard de Larminat, would operate as part of American Lieutenant General Alexander Patch&#x27;s US Seventh Army in the initial stages, as would Army B until the American Sixth United States Army Group, under Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, became active. Juin handed over command of the CEF in Italy to de Lattre on 23 July, and its headquarters was absorbed into that of Army B, with Juin&#x27;s chief of staff, General de brigade Marcel Carpentier, becoming de Lattre&#x27;s. De Lattre embarked for France from Taranto on a Polish liner, the . Accompanying him was Bernard. Fearing that at age sixteen he would soon become eligible for forced labour in Germany, Simmone and Bernard had fled to Algiers via Spain. Bernard was then sent to Douera for training, becoming one of the youngest soldiers in de Lattre&#x27;s army.

The Operation Dragoon landings commenced on 15 August, and de Lattre came ashore the following evening. The American advance had proceeded faster than anticipated, and the 9e to arrive early. In a characteristically aggressive move, de Lattre moved immediately on Toulon and Marseille in the hope that they could be secured before the Germans could organise their defence. He sent General de division Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert&#x27;s 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to encircle Toulon while General de brigade Diego Brosset&#x27;s 1st Motorised Infantry Division attacked along the coast and Magnan&#x27;s 9th Colonial Infantry Division, which had been landed early, attacked in the middle. Toulon was encircled on 21 August, and the port was taken by the 9th Colonial Infantry Division five days later. Meanwhile, de Lattre had already moved on Marseille, which was reached by General de brigade Aimé Sudre&#x27;s Combat Command 1 of the 1st Armoured Division on 21 August. De Lattre had not intended to rush the city, but Sudre&#x27;s arrival sparked a popular uprising, enabling Combat Command 1 to reach the old port. The progress of operations against Toulon allowed de Lattre to release the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to participate in the Battle of Marseille. The German garrison surrendered on 28 August, and a thanksgiving ceremony was held at Notre-Dame de la Garde the following day.
Lyon was taken by the 1st Motorised Infantry Division on 3 September, and on 12 September contact was made with Général de division Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque&#x27;s 2nd Armoured Division, which had come from Normandy. This allowed Army B to officially become the French 1st Army on 25 September 1944. As summer turned to autumn and units moved into higher altitudes and latitudes of the Vosges, many of them still wearing summer uniforms, the troops began to feel the cold. This was especially true of the Army of Africa and Colonial Army units that made up the bulk of de Lattre&#x27;s forces, which had come from warmer climates. Many of them had been fighting in Italy since early in the year, and had become exhausted by the rapid advance up the Rhône Valley. Equipment wore out even faster, and the French logistical system was stretched to its limit just to provide the army with its daily requirements of food, fuel and ammunition. On occasion they encountered an apathetic local population, and what de Lattre regarded as a dangerous sentiment arose among the North African troops that the French people should be making a bigger contribution.

De Lattre sought to address this by incorporating units of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) into the Army, which would enable him to replace his losses and relieve the burden on African units of his Army. The French authorities were eager to bring the estimated 200,000 armed men of the FFI under control as soon as possible, but this was no easy task; the soldiers were suspicious of the discipline and reliability of FFI units, and resented the ranks and titles its leaders had accorded themselves. The FFI were also suspicious of the army, but by the end of the year 137,000 had enlisted in the French Army for the duration of the war. Uniforms and equipment had to be provided by the Americans, but while they agreed to equip security battalions and five regiments to replace North African ones, they were reluctant to provide equipment for the activation of new divisions. Eventually they relented, and among the reactivated divisions in February 1945 was de Lattre&#x27;s old command, the 14th Infantry Division. Once agan, he opened a training centre, this time at Rouffach near Colmar.

=== Final campaigns ===
The Americans envisaged a passive role for the First Army in view of its logistical difficulties, but de Lattre pressed for a more active role. A combination of stubborn German resistance and bad weather brought operations in Alsace to a halt in October. On the eve of the resumption of his offensive in November, de Lattre learned that the Provisional Government wanted to take the 1st Armoured Division and 1st Infantry Division from him for an operation to clear German forces from the Royan pocket on the Gironde Estuary and reopen the port of Bordeaux. De Lattre appealed to Devers, who agreed to seek a postponement of the Bordeaux operation. He ultimately managed to get it postponed until April 1945. De Lattre&#x27;s attack went ahead on 14 November. Belfort was taken on 25 November, but his attempt at encircling the German forces did not cut off any many as he hoped, although 17,000 prisoners were taken.
In December, the Battle of the Bulge briefly halted the Allied advance, and for a while it seemed they would have to abandon Alsace and Strasbourg. This was not a politically feasible option for de Gaulle, especially since Strasbourg had so recently been liberated. De Lattre assumed responsibility for the defence of Strasbourg on 5 January; he had already acted to save it on his own initiative and contrary to his orders. Despite heavy pressure from the advancing German forces, which came within of the city, he managed to hold it. The German offensive was finally halted by the US VI Corps in the north and the 1st Motorised Division in the south. De Lattre then moved to eliminate the Colmar Pocket. For this operation, Devers placed the four US divisions of Major General Frank W. Milburn&#x27;s US XXI Corps under de Lattre&#x27;s command. Colmar was liberated on 2 February 1945. On 11 February, de Gaulle visited the city and invested de Lattre with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.

The First Army breached the Siegfried Line on 19 March 1945. On 31 March 1945, it crossed the Rhine at Speyer and Germersheim and advanced through the Black Forest to Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. The Danube was crossed on 22 April. Ulm lay outside the First Army&#x27;s zone, but meant a great deal to French people as the site of Napoleon&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Ulm in 1805. On the way, they passed through Sigmaringen, to whence the heads of the Vichy government had fled in August 1944 to establish a government in exile in Germany, although de Lattre&#x27;s forces did not reach it in time to capture Pétain or Pierre Laval. Ulm was taken by American and French units on 24 April, and they raised the tricolour over the city&#x27;s old fort, as Napoleon had done. Devers ordered de Lattre to withdraw from the city, and with the mission accomplished, this was done. In a tribute to de Lattre on 13 May, Devers quipped: &quot;For many months we have fought together – often on the same side.&quot;

On 8 May 1945, de Lattre flew to Berlin, where he went to headquarters of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov for the official German surrender ceremony. Already there was Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, General Carl Spaatz and Admiral Sir Harold Burrough. No preparations had been made for a French representative, but some Russian women improvised a tricolour from a flag of Nazi Germany, a white bed sheet and blue mechanic&#x27;s boiler suit. Tedder championed de Lattre&#x27;s right to sign the document as the French representative, and as a compromise it was signed by Zhukov and Spaatz with Tedder and de Lattre as witnesses. On the nine copies that Zhukov signed first de Lattre was first witness while Tedder signed as first witness on the nine that Spaatz signed first.

On 15 June, de Lattre attended the first meeting of the Allied Control Council. The First Army was dissolved on 24 July, and he succeeded as Commander in Chief of the French Army of Occupation by Général de Corps d&#x27;Armée Marie-Pierre Koenig three days later. On 4 August 1945 de Lattre departed. Colour parties from each of the regiments of the First Army were drawn up along the banks of the Rhine at Kehl, and he saluted each one in turn.

== Postwar ==
In July 1945, de Lattre was offered the position of Inspector General of the Army an honorific position he regarded as beneath the status that he had earned as commander of the First Army. He declined and asked to be retired instead. De Gaulle then offered to combine the position with that of the Chief of Staff of the French Army, and de Lattre accepted, assuming the post on 29 November 1945. His task was demobilising the wartime army and building a new one. Most of the officer corps had spent the war since 1940 in prisoner of war camps in Germany, and their training was out of date. To build a force that was both democratic and national, he resolved to create a conscript army rather than a professional one. To prepare the 1946 conscripts, de Lattre opened a dozen new training centres modelled on those he had created during the war at Opme, Douera and Rouffach, where they would be schooled in citizenship. To address the shortage of instructors, he devised a system whereby the national servicemen would train themselves. Careers in the post-war army would be open to the best regardless of their social status. In his personal selection, though, de Lattre tended to favour those who had served with the First Army.

De Lattre was abruptly relieved of his responsibilities as Chief of Staff in March 1947, although he remained Inspector General, and was elevated to Inspector General of the Armed Forces in the spring of 1948, and on 2 June 1948 he was made vice president of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre, positions which had little authority in peacetime. From September to November 1947, he led a diplomatic and economic mission to South America where he held numerous talks with presidents from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil and high-ranking ministers, including French communities there. He also took part in several related economic and diplomatic conferences.

From 4 October 1948 to 13 December 1950, de Lattre was the first commander-in-chief of Western Union Defence Organisation ground forces in Western Europe. While in that post he often came into conflict with British Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Union forces. The two clashed over many issues, the most important of which was whether the Allies were prepared to meet a Soviet attack on the Rhine, something Montgomery tried hard to get his government to accept. De Lattre insisted on speaking to Montgomery in French, although he had a good command of English. However, on the occasion of Montgomery&#x27;s 63rd birthday in November 1950, Montgomery invited de Lattre to tea. Montgomery cut his birthday cake and gave de Lattre an extra slice for Bernard, who was then serving in French Indochina. What was a spontaneous gesture touched de Lattre deeply.

== Indochina ==

From December 1950 to November 1951, de Lattre commanded French troops in Indochina during the First Indochina War. He implemented scorched earth tactics in an effort to limit Việt Minh access to food and other supplies. French forces burned crops in areas of Việt Minh activity. These tactics increased the anger of the Vietnamese people against the French and were a strategic failure.

After de Lattre&#x27;s arrival in Vietnam, Việt Minh General Giap proclaimed that his army would face &quot;an adversary worthy of its steel&quot;. De Lattre&#x27;s arrival raised the morale of French troops significantly and inspired his forces to inflict heavy defeats on the Việt Minh. He won three major victories at Vĩnh Yên, Mạo Khê and Yen Cu Ha and successfully defended the north of the country against the Việt Minh. At the Battle of Vĩnh Yên, he defeated 2 Việt Minh divisions, totalling 20,000 men under Giap&#x27;s personal command. He personally took charge of the outnumbered French forces, flying in reinforcements and mustering every available aircraft for airstrikes against the massive Việt Minh formation. Giap retreated after three fierce days of combat that killed 6,000 and wounded 8,000. De Lattre had anticipated Giap&#x27;s attacks and had reinforced French defences with hundreds of cement blockhouses and new airfields.

In March 1951, at the Battle of Mạo Khê near the port of Haiphong, de Lattre again defeated Giap, who had underestimated de Lattre&#x27;s army&#x27;s ability to deploy naval guns and to move reinforcements aboard assault boats on deep estuaries and canals. However, Bernard was killed in action in the Battle for Nam Định, in late May 1951. He had obeyed his father&#x27;s orders to hold the town at all costs against three Việt Minh divisions. After three weeks of battle the French victory halted Giap&#x27;s offensive in the Red River Delta. On 20 September 1951, de Lattre spoke at The Pentagon to request American aid and warned of the danger of the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia if northern Vietnam fell completely to the Việt Minh. However, the United States was preoccupied with the Korean War. The US sent de Lattre some transport planes and trucks and other equipment: a &quot;significant contribution&quot; but &quot;scarcely enough to turn the tide for France&quot; in Vietnam.

He was highly regarded by both his French subordinates and Việt Minh adversaries and has been described as the &quot;Gallic version of [General Douglas] MacArthur – handsome, stylish, sometimes charming, yet egocentric to the point of megalomania&quot; and &quot;brilliant and vain&quot; and &quot;flamboyant&quot;. 

== Death ==

On 20 November 1951, illness forced de Lattre to return to Paris for medical treatment for prostate cancer. He entered the Clinique Maillot in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 18 December. His condition deteriorated in January. His last words before losing consciousness on 9 January were: &quot;Where is Bernard?&quot; He died on 11 January.

De Lattre was posthumously elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France by the President of France, Vincent Auriol, on the day of his funeral procession, 15 January 1952 at Notre-Dame de Paris, Les Invalides in presence of de Gaulle, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Montgomery. He was buried in a state funeral lasting five days, in what &quot;Life&quot; magazine described as the &quot;biggest military funeral France had seen since the death of Marshal Foch in 1929&quot;. His body was moved through the streets of Paris in a series of funeral processions, with the coffin lying in state at four separate locations: his home, the chapel at Les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe and before Notre-Dame. Those marching in the funeral procession included members of the French cabinet, judges, bishops and Western military leaders. The route included the Rue de Rivoli and the Champs-Élysées.

The processions went from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre-Dame and then from Notre-Dame to Les Invalides. The stage of the journey from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre-Dame took place in the evening, and cavalrymen from the &quot;Garde républicaine&quot; flanked the coffin on horseback bearing flaming torches. Walking behind the soldiers marching in the funeral processions was the lone figure of the Marshal&#x27;s widow, Simonne de Lattre de Tassigny, who was dressed in black and prayed as she walked. Thousands of people lined the funeral route, forming crowds that were ten-deep. The pageantry included the tolling of bells, and flags being flown at half-mast. The final stage of the funeral was a journey of to his birthplace of Mouilleron-en-Pareds, in western France. There his 97-year-old father, Roger de Lattre, aged and blind, ran his hands over the ceremonial accoutrements on the coffin, which included the posthumously-awarded marshal&#x27;s baton and his son&#x27;s képi. The family line became extinct with his death. The coffin was lowered into the ground and the Marshal was laid to rest beside his only son, Bernard, who had been killed fighting under his father&#x27;s command in Indochina about eight months earlier.

<text>Akamai Technologies, Inc. is an American company specialized in content delivery network (CDN), cybersecurity, DDoS mitigation, and cloud services. It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== History ==
The company was named after &quot;&quot;, which means &#x27;clever,&#x27; or more colloquially, &#x27;cool&#x27; in Hawaiian. Co-founder Daniel M. Lewin found the term in a Hawaiian-English dictionary after a colleague&#x27;s suggestion.

Akamai Technologies entered the 1998 MIT $50K competition with a business proposition based on their research on consistent hashing, and was selected as one of the finalists. By August 1998, they had developed a working prototype, and with the help of Jonathan Seelig and Randall Kaplan, they took steps to incorporate the company. Akamai Technologies was incorporated on August 20, 1998.
In late 1998 and early 1999, a group of business professionals and scientists joined the founding team—most notably, Paul Sagan, former president of New Media for Time Inc., and George Conrades, former chairman and chief executive officer of BBN Corp. and senior vice president of US operations for IBM. Conrades became chief executive officer of Akamai in April 1999. The company launched its commercial service in April 1999 and was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market from October 29, 1999.
On July 1, 2001, Akamai was added to the Russell 3000 Index and Russell 2000 Index.

On September 11, 2001, co-founder Daniel M. Lewin died in the September 11 attacks at the age of 31 when he was stabbed by one of the hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center. He was seated closest to the hijackers and may have tried to stop them.

Arabic news network Al-Jazeera was an Akamai customer from March 28, 2003 to April 2, 2003, when Akamai decided to end the relationship, which the network&#x27;s English-language managing editor claimed was due to &quot;political pressure&quot;.

In 2005, Paul Sagan was named chief executive officer of Akamai, taking over from Conrades. Sagan worked to differentiate Akamai from its competitors by expanding its breadth of services. Under his leadership, it grew to $1.37 billion in revenue.

In July 2007, Akamai was added to the S&amp;P 500 Index.

In 2013, co-founder Tom Leighton was elected chief executive officer, replacing Sagan.

In 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former executive at Akamai Technologies for illegally tipping non-public information about the company&#x27;s financial predicament as part of the insider trading scheme operated by now-imprisoned Galleon Management hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. In 2014 it was reported that the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation used Facebook&#x27;s Akamai CDN to collect information on Facebook users. 

On February 9, 2021, Akamai announced it would reorganize into two internal groups, Security Technology and Edge Technology. It also re-established the role of chief technology officer, and named Robert Blumofe to that role. Long-time chief security officer (CSO) Andy Ellis announced he would leave in March 2021.

Akamai&#x27;s headquarters are in Kendall Square. It started in Technology Square and later expanded to multiple buildings in Cambridge Center. It consolidated its offices in a purpose-built building at 145 Broadway in December 2019.

In February 2025, Akamai was chosen as the strategic cloud computing provider by one of the world&#x27;s largest technology companies, with a multi-year commitment to spend over $100 million on cloud infrastructure services. The company&#x27;s cloud infrastructure services primarily consist of compute and storage solutions developed based on Linode, a cloud hosting provider acquired by Akamai for $900 million in 2022.

===Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform===
The Akamai Intelligent Platform is a distributed cloud computing platform that operates worldwide, a network of over approximately 365,000 servers in more than 135 countries. These servers reside on roughly 1,350 of the world&#x27;s networks, gathering real-time information about traffic, congestion, and trouble spots. Each Akamai server is equipped with proprietary software that uses complex algorithms to process requests from nearby users.

===Content delivery process===
The content delivery process begins with a user submitting a request to a browser. When a user enters a URL, a DNS request is triggered to Akamai&#x27;s authoritative DNS and an IP address is retrieved. With the IP address, the browser can then directly contact the Akamai edge server for subsequent requests. In a content delivery network (CDN) structure, the domain name of the URL is translated by the mapping system into the IP address of an edge server to serve the content to the user.

Akamai delivers web content over its Intelligent Platform by transparently mirroring elements such as HTML, CSS, software downloads, and media objects from customers&#x27; servers. The Akamai server is automatically chosen depending on the type of content and the user&#x27;s network location. The servers are located in more than 200 countries and territories. Receiving content from a server nearer to the user allows for faster downloads and less vulnerability to network congestion. Akamai claims to provide better scalability by delivering the content over the last mile from servers close to end-users, avoiding the middle-mile bottleneck of the Internet. The Download Delivery product line includes HTTP downloads for large downloadable objects, a customizable application for consumers, and analytics tools with metrics that monitor and report on the download process.

===Peer-to-peer networking===
In addition to using its own servers, Akamai delivers certain content from other end-users&#x27; computers, in the form of peer-to-peer networking.

===OPEN Initiative===
On October 9, 2013, Akamai announced its Open Initiative at the 2013 Akamai Edge Conference. OPEN allows customers and partners to develop and customize how they interact with the Akamai Intelligent Platform. Its key components include system and development operations integration, real-time big data integration, and a single-point user interface.
