<text>Hexham Abbey is a Grade I listed church dedicated to St Andrew, in the town of Hexham, Northumberland, in the North East of England. Originally built in AD 674, the Abbey was built up during the 12th century into its current form, with additions around the turn of the 20th century. Since the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537, the Abbey has been the parish church of Hexham. In 2014 the Abbey regained ownership of its former monastic buildings, which had been used as Hexham magistrates&#x27; court, and subsequently developed them into a permanent exhibition and visitor centre, telling the story of the Abbey&#x27;s history.

==History==
There has been a church on the site for over 1300 years since Etheldreda, Queen of Northumbria, made a grant of lands to St Wilfrid, Bishop of York, c.674 AD. Of Wilfrid&#x27;s Benedictine abbey, which was constructed almost entirely of material salvaged from nearby Roman ruins, the Saxon crypt still remains; as does a frith stool, a 7th/8th century cathedra or throne. For a little while around that time it was the seat of a bishopric.

In the year 875 Halfdan Ragnarsson the Dane ravaged the whole of Tyneside, and Hexham Church was plundered and burnt to the ground.

About 1050, one Eilaf was put in charge of Hexham, although as treasurer of Durham, he probably never went there. Eilaf was instructed to rebuild Hexham Church, which then lay in utter ruin. His son Eilaf II completed the work, probably building in the Norman style.

In Norman times, Wilfrid&#x27;s abbey was replaced by an Augustinian priory. The current church largely dates from c.1170–1250, built in the Early English style of architecture. The choir, north and south transepts and the cloisters, where canons studied and meditated, date from this period.

The east end was rebuilt in 1858. The Abbey was largely rebuilt during the incumbency of Canon Edwin Sidney Savage, who came to Hexham in 1898 and remained until 1919. This mammoth project involved re-building the nave, whose walls incorporate some of the earlier church, and the restoration of the choir. The nave was re-consecrated on 8 August 1908.

The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1951. In 1996 an additional chapel was created at the east end of the north choir aisle; named &quot;St Wilfrid&#x27;s Chapel&quot;, which offers a place for prayer or quiet reflection. A high-profile wedding in the same year saw West Sussex socialites, Joanna and Richard Britton, married in the Abbey with their first-born son, Joshua, returning a year later for his christening service.

===Stained glass===
Four of the stained glass windows in the Abbey are the work of Jersey-born stained glass artist Henry Thomas Bosdet who was commissioned by the Abbey. The east window was the first project and was installed about 1907. Two smaller windows followed and the large west window was installed in 1918.

===Crypt===
The crypt is a plain structure of four chambers. Here were exhibited the relics which were a feature of Wilfrid&#x27;s church. It consists of a chapel with an ante-chapel at the west end, two side passages with enlarged vestibules and three stairways. The chapel and ante-chapel are barrel-vaulted. All the stones used are of Roman workmanship and many are carved or with inscriptions. One inscription on a slab, partially erased, is:
Translated, this means &quot;The Emperor Lucius Septimus Severus Pius Pertinax and his sons the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Augustus and Publius Geta Caesar the cohorts and detachments made this under the command of ….&quot;. The words erased are of great interest: after the Emperor Geta was murdered by his brother Caracalla, an edict was made at Rome ordering that whenever the two names appeared in combination that of Geta was to be erased. This so-called &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; was carried out, but so poorly that the name can still be read.

==Bishopric of Hexham==
The first diocese of Lindisfarne was merged into the Diocese of York in 664. York diocese was then divided in 678 by Theodore of Tarsus, forming a bishopric for the country between the Rivers Aln and Tees, with a seat at Hexham and/or Lindisfarne. This gradually and erratically merged back into the bishopric of Lindisfarne. Eleven bishops of Hexham followed St. Eata, of which six were saints.

No successor was appointed in 821, the condition of the country being too unsettled. A period of disorder followed the Danish devastations, after which Hexham monastery was reconstituted in 1113 as a priory of Austin Canons, which flourished until its dissolution under Henry VIII. Meantime the bishopric had been merged in that of Lindisfarne, which latter see was removed to Chester-le-Street in 883, and thence to Durham in 995.

==Tombstone of Flavinus, Roman standard-bearer==
The tombstone of Flavinus is one of the most significant Roman finds in Britain. It can be found in the Abbey in front of a blocked doorway at the foot of the Night Stair. Flavinus was a Roman cavalry officer who died aged 25 in the first century. The slab is thought to have once stood near the fort of Coria near Corbridge and was brought here as a building stone in the 12th century. The slab was laid face-upward in the foundations of the cloister and was rediscovered in 1881.

== Hexham Hoard ==
In 1833 a hoard of approximately 8000 stycas were discovered whilst a grave was being dug in the Campey Hill area close to the north transept. The Hexham Hoard was concealed circa 850. It was composed of coins from the reigns of Eanred, Aethelred II and Redwulf, as well as coins of two archbishops Eanbald and Wigmund.

==Organ==

In 1865 the Abbey acquired a second-hand organ from Carlisle Cathedral dating from 1804. It was installed in Hexham by Nicholson of Newcastle and opened on 19 October 1865. In 1905 this was rebuilt by Norman and Beard with Sir Frederick Bridge of Westminster Abbey as the consultant.

In 1974 a new instrument by Lawrence Phelps of Pennsylvania was installed. It is a two manual 34-stop mechanical action instrument.

<text>In Zen art, an is a circle hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express the Zen mind, which is associated with enlightenment, emptiness, freedom, and the state of no-mind.

==Description==
The symbolizes absolute enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe (Dharmadhatu), and (emptiness). It is characterised by a minimalism influenced by Zen Buddhist philosophy, and Japanese aesthetics. An empty circle also appears in the ten oxherding pictures which is a set of illustrations that depict Zen training.

Drawing is a disciplined-creative practice of Japanese ink painting, . The tools and mechanics of drawing the are the same as those used in traditional Japanese calligraphy: One uses an ink brush to apply ink to (a thin Japanese paper).

The circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development and the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to , the beauty of imperfection. The space inside the circle may represent the state of the realization of emptiness (shunyata) or no-mind.

Usually, a person draws the in one fluid, expressive stroke. When drawn according to the (cursive) style of Japanese calligraphy, the brushstroke is especially swift. Once the is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period. Drawing is a spiritual practice that one might perform as often as once per day.

This spiritual practice of drawing or writing Japanese calligraphy for self-realization is called . exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; perspective and aesthetic: &quot;fukinsei&quot; (asymmetry, irregularity), &quot;kanso&quot; (simplicity), &quot;koko&quot; (basic; weathered), &quot;shizen&quot; (without pretense; natural), &quot;yugen&quot; (subtly profound grace), &quot;datsuzoku&quot; (freedom), and &quot;seijaku&quot; (tranquility).

<doc id="477928" wikidata="Q5598782" url="?curid=477928" title="Great Blue Norther of November 11, 1911">
<text>On Saturday, November 11, 1911, a cold snap, known as the Great Blue Norther of 11/11/11, affected the Central United States. Many cities broke record highs, going into the 70s and 80s early that afternoon. By nightfall, cities were dealing with temperatures in the teens and single-digits on the Fahrenheit scale. This is the only day in many midwest cities&#x27; weather bureau jurisdictions where the record highs and lows were broken for the same day. Some cities experienced tornadoes on Saturday and a blizzard on Sunday. A blizzard even occurred within one hour after an F4 tornado hit Rock County, Wisconsin.

The front produced severe weather and tornadoes across the upper Mississippi Valley, a blizzard in Ohio, and the windy conditions upon front passage caused a dust storm in Oklahoma. Alongside the dramatic temperature swings, the cold front brought a destructive tornado outbreak to parts of the Midwest. At least 13 tornadoes touched down across five states as the system moved through, resulting in 13 fatalities. Hundreds of structures were destroyed by the storms and many areas had to conduct search and rescue missions amidst blizzard conditions. Thomas P. Grazulis stated in 1990 that this outbreak was one of the worst on record in November for the north-central States.

==Background==
The main cause of such a dramatic cold snap was an extremely strong storm system separating warm, humid air from frigid, arctic air. Dramatic cold snaps tend to occur mostly in the month of November, though they can also come in February or March. These arrivals of Continental Polar or Arctic air masses are generally called northers, and the one in question was marked by a mass of steel blue clouds in the vicinity of the surface front, hence the name. Although temperature drops of this extent have happened on other occasions, as recently as February 2009, the fact that the 1911 cold front passage was during the autumn and came after such warm weather contributed to the properties mentioned in this article.
==Impact==
The cold front was so strong, that while several states saw record monthly highs on November 10 and 11, they saw record cold monthly lows on November 12 and 13. This was especially true in Missouri, where one station had a high of before the storm, and after the storm, another station had a low of . The cold front began on November 9. Rapid City, South Dakota went from at 6am to at 8am. Between November 10 and 11th, Denver experienced its eleventh largest two day temperature swing, from , which is a change.

On November 11, temperatures in Kansas City had reached a record high of by late morning before the front moved through. As the cold front approached, the winds increased turning from southeast to northwest. By midnight, the temperature had dropped to , a difference in 14 hours. The next day would have a record low of and a high of only . In Springfield, the temperature difference was even more extreme. Springfield was at at about 3:45 p.m. CST (21:45 UTC), before the cold front moved through. Fifteen minutes later, the temperature was at with winds out of the northwest at . By 7:00 p.m. CST (01:00 UTC 12 November) the temperature had dropped a further , and by midnight (06:00 UTC), a record low of was established. It was the first time since records had been kept for Springfield when the record high and record low were broken in the same day. The freak temperature difference was also a record breaker: in 10 hours. Peak wind gusts reached . The low on the morning of November 12 was . St. Louis dropped from in just ten minutes. Record highs and lows were established on the same day in Oklahoma City as well with a high of and low of ; temperature difference: . Both records still hold. The temperate dropped further to a record low of on November 12, before gradually warming, as Oklahoma City hit on November 13 and on November 14. It also produced a dust storm. Tulsa, Oklahoma had an even more dramatic plunge from in the afternoon of November 11 to by the morning of November 12, although the temperature at midnight is not known. Independence, Kansas saw the temperature drop from in one hour. In Denton, Texas, the temperature drop wasn&#x27;t as immediate, with it dropping from at 5pm to by 6pm, but the low the morning of November 12 was still . While this wasn&#x27;t Amarillo&#x27;s biggest temperature drop, the drop from is still an impressive drop. Nearby Dallas also saw an impressive plunge from by midnight and by the next morning the mercury was . In Chicago, Illinois, people died separately of heatstroke and cold, respectively, within 24 hours, the first such incidence on record in the city. They dropped from during the event. Across central Illinois, up to of snow fell, and in Peoria, Illinois, after a high of on November 11, the temperature crashed to by midnight, and the high on November 12 was . While only the southern and eastern parts of Iowa felt the Norther, the impacts there were nonetheless powerful, as Albia, Iowa fell from in twelve hours.

The front did not reach Columbus until 3am on November 12, but when it did, temperatures plummeted from , just a degree from a record high, to in an hour, and down to - a record low - that night. By November 13, temperatures dipped further to . Lexington, KY also saw the temperature drop on the 12th, when it went from nearly down to a record low from . It dipped to another record low of on November 13, and a record cold high of was also established. However, the record low for November 13 was broken in 2019. Bowling Green saw the drop across the entire day on November 12, from . Temperature plunges ranged from on the East Coast.
===Tornadoes===
On Saturday, November 11, 1911, a regionally and seasonally significant tornado outbreak affected the Great Lakes region of the United States. The outbreak generated at least 13 tornadoes, including a violent, long-tracked F4 that impacted Wisconsin, killing at least nine people and injuring 50 more. Other intense tornadoes occurred in Illinois and Indiana, resulting in four additional fatalities. Several other tornadoes were reported from multiple states. In all, the outbreak killed 16 people and injured at least 101. Total losses exceeded $1.755 million (1911 USD). Tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis considered the outbreak to be the worst in the month of November on record at the time in the Great Lakes region.

Some cities experienced tornadoes on Saturday and a blizzard on Sunday. The passage of a cold front, marked by strong winds, produced severe weather, including tornadoes, across the upper Mississippi River Valley, a blizzard in Ohio, and a dust storm in Oklahoma.

====Confirmed tornadoes====

*A possible tornado caused extensive damage in Bedford, Lawrence County, Indiana, with losses reaching $500,000. Another possible tornado killed horses and cattle near Kingsland in Eaton County, Michigan. At least three other tornadoes may have affected Green, Dane, and Walworth counties, respectively, in the state of Wisconsin.

<doc id="477931" wikidata="Q1763519" url="?curid=477931" title="Six Assurances">
<text>The Six Assurances are six key foreign policy principles of the United States regarding United States–Taiwan relations. They were passed as unilateral U.S. clarifications to the Third Communiqué between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1982. They were intended to reassure both Taiwan and the United States Congress that the US would continue to support Taiwan even if it had earlier cut formal diplomatic relations.

The assurances were originally proposed by the then Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) government of the Republic of China on Taiwan during negotiations between the U.S. and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The U.S. Reagan administration agreed to the assurances and informed the United States Congress of them in July 1982.

Today, the Six Assurances are part of semiformal guidelines used in conducting relations between the US and Taiwan. The assurances have been generally reaffirmed by successive U.S. administrations. Prior to 2016, they were purely informal, but in 2016, their formal content was adopted by the US House of Representatives and the Senate in non-binding resolutions, upgrading their status to formal but not directly enforceable.

==Text==
The United States House of Representatives passed a concurrent resolution on May 16, 2016, giving the first formal wording for the Six Assurances by more or less directly adopting how the former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs John H. Holdridge expressed them in 1982 (which was delivered to Taiwan&#x27;s President Chiang Ching-kuo by then-Director of the American Institute in Taiwan James R. Lilley):
# “* * * [W]e did not agree to set a date certain for ending arms sales to Taiwan”;
# “* * * [W]e see no mediation role for the United States” between Taiwan and the PRC;
# “* * *[N]or will we attempt to exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC”;
# “* * * [T]here has been no change in our longstanding position on the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan”;
# “We have no plans to seek” revisions to the Taiwan Relations Act; and
# The August 17 Communiqué “should not be read to imply that we have agreed to engage in prior consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan”.

A similar resolution passed the Senate on July 6, 2016.

In the first version, which was introduced to Congress by Rep. Steve Chabot on October 28, 2015, the Six Assurances were proposed to be:

# The United States would not set a date for termination of arms sales to Taiwan;
# The United States would not alter the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act;
# The United States would not consult with China in advance before making decisions about United States arms sales to Taiwan;
# The United States would not mediate between Taiwan and China;
# The United States would not alter its position about the sovereignty of Taiwan which was, that the question was one to be decided peacefully by the Chinese themselves, and would not pressure Taiwan to enter into negotiations with China; and
# The United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.

Declassified cables, sent in 1982 from the State Department, detail the Six Assurances:

# The United States has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan.
# The United States has not agreed to consult with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan.
# The United States will not play a mediation role between Taipei and Beijing.
# The United States has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act.
# The United States has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan.
# The United States will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC.

==Reaffirmation==
The State Department has reaffirmed the Six Assurances repeatedly.

On May 19, 2016, one day before Tsai Ing-wen assumed the Presidency of the Republic of China, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Bob Menendez (D-NJ), former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-chair of the Senate Taiwan Caucus, introduced a concurrent resolution reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the “Six Assurances” as cornerstones of United States–Taiwan relations.

The Republican Party Platform of the 2016 Republican National Convention mentions the Six Assurances, stating, &quot;We salute the people of Taiwan, with whom we share the values of democracy, human rights, a free market economy, and the rule of law. Our relations will continue to be based upon the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, and we affirm the Six Assurances given to Taiwan in 1982 by President Reagan. We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island’s future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan. If China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, will help Taiwan defend itself. We praise efforts by the new government in Taipei to continue constructive relations across the Taiwan Strait and call on China to reciprocate. As a loyal friend of America, Taiwan has merited our strong support, including free trade agreement status, the timely sale of defensive arms including technology to build diesel submarines, and full participation in the World Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and other multilateral institutions.&quot;

The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act () states that it is the policy of the U.S. to enforce commitments to Taiwan consistent with the Six Assurances. As of September 2018, the Donald Trump administration &quot;has stated that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship is also &#x27;guided&#x27; by [the] &#x27;Six Assurances&#x27;&quot;.

In November 2020 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated “Taiwan has not been a part of China, and that was recognized with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three and a half decades, and done so under both administrations.” which was seen as invoking clause 5.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 reconfirmed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and the Six Assurances as the foundation for US-Taiwan relations.

On August 2, 2022, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, in a statement from a visit to Taiwan, made reference to the United States&#x27; continuing support of the TRA, Three Communiqués, and the Six Assurances.

<doc id="477936" wikidata="Q7457234" url="?curid=477936" title="Seven Days in New Crete">
<text>Seven Days in New Crete, also known as Watch the North Wind Rise, is a seminal future-utopian speculative fiction novel by Robert Graves, first published in 1949. It shares many themes and ideas with Graves&#x27; &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, published a year earlier. Martin Seymour-Smith, Graves&#x27;s biographer, further suggested it was autobiographical, &quot;telling the essential story of his life between 1929 and 1947&quot;.

==Summary==
The novel takes place in a future society (first established on the island of Crete, but later spreading through much of the world) in which most post-medieval technology has been rejected, and a Triple Goddess religion is followed. The book is narrated by a mid-20th century poet, Edward Venn-Thomas, who is transported forward in time by the New Cretans. Society is organised into five &quot;estates&quot; or social groups: captains, recorders (scribes), commons (by far the most numerous), servants, and magicians or poets (the least numerous), which are analogised to the five fingers of a hand. Different villages practice different marriage customs (strict monogamy, non-strict monogamy, or polyandry), worship different local &quot;godlings&quot;, and specialise in various local handcrafts and foodstuffs, but share the common values of the New Cretan civilisation and devotion to the Goddess.

Some of the social customs are somewhat matriarchal. There is no poverty in New Crete (money has been abolished) and little dissatisfaction. War is only known in the form of controlled local one-day conflicts between neighbouring villages, similar to the old game of village football or Shrovetide football. The poets or magicians of New Crete are an integral part of a religion centred on a sometimes capricious Goddess worshipped in three aspects: the maiden archer Nimuë, the goddess of motherhood and sexuality Mari, and the hag-goddess of wisdom Ana. (The names of the last two are similar to those of the Virgin Mary and her mother Saint Anne in Christianity.)

The only masculine elements of New Cretan religion are the rival twin demi-gods (the star-god of the first half of the year and the serpent-god of the second half of the year) who compete for the Goddess&#x27;s favour, and the local village godlings, who are all far below the Goddess as Queen of Heaven. However, the failings of past fallen civilisations are remembered and personified as an anti-trinity of evil gods (the &quot;three Rogues&quot;): Dobeis, god of money and greed; Pill, god of theft and violence; and Machna, god of science and soulless machinery.

The New Cretan language is derived from Catalan, modified by heavy English-language influence and apparent minor Slavic and Celtic influences. The writing down of words is considered to be too sacred an act to be profaned by ordinary every-day uses, and paper is banned in New Cretan society, and only members of the scribal estate and the poet-magician estate are commonly literate. However, numerical tally-marks are allowed to be used for everyday purposes, and many people of other estates learn to read in later life, after they retire into elder status, and some of the ordinary taboos of New Cretan life are relaxed when in the presence of other elders.

Though Venn-Thomas has been moved in time, he is still in the same area of southern France where he lived before and after World War II, and he compares the conditions in his own time to those under the New Cretan civilisation (mostly to the disfavor of the 20th century, though some things seem &quot;too good to be true&quot;).

In this apparently idyllic utopian setting, Venn-Thomas begins to realise that he has been chosen by the Goddess to inject disruption into a society that is becoming static and in danger of losing its vitality. A symptom of trouble is that over the course of the week described in the novel, the five poet-magicians of the &quot;Magic House&quot; of the village of Horned Lamb all die or lose their status as members of the poet-magician estate.

In the last section of the book, Venn-Thomas makes a trip to Dunrena, the town which is the capital of the local kingdom, to witness the twice-yearly ceremony of the changing of the king, carried out as a solemn religious-theatrical performance culminating in a ritual sacrifice similar to those described in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. At the end of the book, Venn-Thomas unleashes the whirlwind which will prepare the way for the transition to the next phase of history, and Sapphire (a young woman for whom he has had unsettled feelings) returns with him through time to be reborn as his daughter.

==Similar works==
Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The Corridors of Time&quot; shares many themes with Graves&#x27; book, also including a depiction of a future matriarchal world dominated by a Great Goddess religion seen through the eyes of a traveller from our time. However, Anderson&#x27;s version of such a world is far more harsh and dystopian, leading the plot to a conclusion very different from Graves&#x27;.

<text>Kresge College is one of the residential colleges that make up the University of California, Santa Cruz. Founded in 1971 and named after Sebastian Kresge, Kresge college is located on the western edge of the UCSC campus. Kresge is the sixth of ten colleges at UCSC, and originally one of the most experimental. The first provost of Kresge, Bob Edgar, had been strongly influenced by his experience in T-groups run by NTL Institute. He asked a T-group facilitator, psychologist Michael Kahn, to help him start the college. When they arrived at UCSC, they taught a course, Creating Kresge College, in which they and the students in it designed the college. Kresge was a participatory democracy, and students had extraordinary power in the early years. The college was run by two committees: Community Affairs and Academic Affairs. Any faculty member, student or staff member who wanted to be on these committees could be on them. Students&#x27; votes counted as much as the faculty or staff. These committees determined the budgets and hiring. They were also run by consensus. Distinguished early faculty members included Gregory Bateson, former husband of Margaret Mead and author of &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;; Phil Slater, author of &quot;The Pursuit of Loneliness&quot;; John Grinder, co-founder of Neuro-linguistic programming and co-author of &quot;The Structure of Magic&quot;; and William Everson, one of the Beat poets.

Distinguished graduates from the early days of Kresge College include Doug Foster, who went on to become editor of Mother Jones magazine, and Richard Bandler, who co-founded Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) with John Grinder.

==Architecture==
The architecture of Kresge College is designed to resemble a residential area in Tuscany, and includes a piazzetta next to the college office and mail room. The informal quality of the space, especially the narrow street, was a reaction against the modernist skyscrapers of the previous generation of dormitory buildings.

Kresge students are offered the opportunity to create murals around Kresge to keep the College representative of its current age. There are approved mural areas on buildings R1, R3, R6, and R8.
The Kresge Renewal Project is renovating Kresge College to address the University&#x27;s housing crisis. Buildings R7, the Triplets, and the Recreation Center were demolished to make room for three new dormitory buildings, which opened in 2023. Designed by Studio Gang, the curved, mass-timber buildings were shaped to preserve as many redwoods as possible and open up views of the forest. The geometry and bright colors of the end facades resonate with the campus&#x27; original architecture by Charles Moore and William Turnbull of MLTW. Social spaces and student amenities occupy the ground floors while residences are located above. The buildings are among the first cross-laminated buildings in California.   
The new Kresge Academic Center, also designed by Studio Gang, opened in 2023 on Upper Street, where the old Town Hall previously stood. It includes two lecture halls, classrooms, academic offices, work and meeting areas, and an outdoor terrace. The design employs a technique used by polypore fungi — stepping down and flaring out as it descends the steep slope. Large windows look out to the forest and ravine and bring natural light into the building, together with clerestory windows along the passageways. Organic, gently curved outer walls are finished with white plaster, tying the materials of the new building with the original architecture.

A new Town Hall will be built where R11 was located. The Renewal Project will also aid in helping Kresge College becoming ADA compliant, raising the North &quot;Kresge Bridge&quot;. Notable features such as the waterfall steps, piazzetta, and Mayor&#x27;s Stand will remain; the piazzetta has plans to be renovated as well however. Keeping with the tradition of Kresge&#x27;s design, town halls were hosted to gain student input to the renovations.

==The early years==

According to UC President Clark Kerr, Edgar had been influenced by the work of Carl Rogers and was attempting to translate Rogers&#x27; notion of client-centered psychotherapy into a form of student-centered education. Kerr sarcastically explained in his memoirs how this turned out: &quot;A recipe for total anarchy. A recipe for Kresge.&quot; The problem with running the college as a participatory democracy was that only the most committed activists could make it work; everyone else was either sidelined or simply fled.

In the early days, Kresge had a threefold focus: humanistic psychology, women&#x27;s studies and environmental studies. The best history of the early days of the college is a chapter in Gerald Grant and David Reisman&#x27;s award-winning book on experimental colleges in the United States, &quot;The Perpetual Dream: Reform and Experiment in the American College&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1979). Today, the literature, feminist studies and writing departments have moved to the new Humanities building while the Writing Program and the Science Communication Program remain in Kresge.

The current core course, Power and Representation, examines the ways in which an individual relates to communities by focussing on representations of gender, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation and race.

Kresge&#x27;s idiosyncratic architecture, designed by architects William Turnbull and Charles Moore, is based on a fantasy Italian village which winds up the hillside. Instead of dormitories, Kresge housing consisted of apartments, suites (which allowed students to have small single rooms), and octets. The octets were large housing spaces intended for eight students, which the architects deliberately left unfinished. When the college opened, each group of eight students was given $2,000 to design and build the inner walls and floors. The earlier octets had significant open and communal spaces, but the ones designed later had more walls and individual rooms. The openness created such an interpersonal intensity that by the end of the first year, thirty one of the thirty two original students had left the octets for other housing. Also, in the first quarter, they went from octets housing eight students, to sextets housing six students. Today most of the apartments, suites, and sextets serve the same purpose as dorm rooms, although they contain private kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms. The college is acclaimed in architectural circles. For example, it is included in G. E. Kidder Smith&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;Sourcebook of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present&quot; (Princeton University Press).

At the north end of the college was the Kresge Town Hall, which has seen many groundbreaking performances, including the third Talking Heads concert on the west coast, given Dec 4, 1977. 1977 was also the year that the legendary conference, &quot;LSD: A Generation Later&quot; was held at Kresge College. The conference was attended by both counterculture figures such as Timothy Leary PhD, Allen Ginsberg, Ram Dass, Stephen Gaskin, and Ralph Metzner PhD, as well as early psychedelic researchers including Oscar Janiger, MD, William McGlothlin, PhD, Stanley Krippner, PhD, Claudio Naranjo, MD and Willis Harman PhD.

During the day, Town Hall served as a classroom. In the evenings and weekends, it was still used for events such as concerts and films. Annual events include the Fall Film Festival and Halloween showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show with a live cast.

In 1979, Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer implemented major reforms at the Santa Cruz campus which finally ended the most unusual aspects of the Kresge experiment.

Kresge was originally endowed by the Kresge family trust, whose fortune was derived from K-Mart; one of the early (and very ironic) nicknames of Kresge was &#x27;K-Mart&#x27; college; considering its traditionally counter-cultural orientation, it was about as far from the middle American K-Mart image as could be imagined. The architects originally wanted to put a neon sign from an S. S. Kresge department store at the entrance to the college, but this idea met too much resistance.

==Student life==
Kresge College is currently home to several co-ops (Natural Foods Co-op, Photo Co-op, Garden Co-op) as well as the social justice organization, Common Grounds. Residential housing themes include the Writer&#x27;s House, the Eco-Village, Trans Inclusive Housing, Substance Free, Sober and Clean Recovery Housing, Single Gender, and Mixed Gender.

Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS), the Veterans Resource Center (VETS), and the Student Lounge which has a public kitchen and restrooms are all services within Kresge College, located next to the Piazzetta, west of Lower Street.

Kresge Parliament, and the Kresge Multicultural Education Committee (KMEC), and Orientation Leaders are ways that Kresge students can get more involved in student life.. Kresge Parliament is the student government representing Kresge College. It is open to all Kresge affiliates, from first years to transfer students, and engages in community service, funding requests, and occasionally hosts events. KMEC sponsors PRIDE, an annual campus wide event starting at the Bookstore and ending in Kresge Lower Street. PRIDE often has resources, food, and performances from various student clubs. Orientation Leaders meet before the school year and welcome in the incoming freshmen. They help with move in, and welcome week where they host various events to create a community in Kresge and help with any move in nerves. An annual welcome week tradition is the Board Walk Frolic where UCSC students collectively go to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

Next to the computer lab, there is a Free Book Library where students can leave and take books as needed. Books available range from poetry to class readers. This Library was added in 2017 by Kresge Parliament. Parliament also purchased a ping pong table which is located in the laundry room where students are able to play against each other while waiting for their clothes to finish washing.

The Kresge Programs Office hosts events for students yearlong. Every quarter, there is a Late Night Breakfast where the Porter/Kresge Dining Hall is reserved only for Kresge Affiliates. The Programs Office also offers supplies for students to check out including board games, Giant Jenga, and frisbees.

==Interesting points==
One of the alumni of Kresge, Marti Noxon, went on to produce &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and managed to sneak in-joke references to Kresge as well as Santa Cruz into many of the scripts, most recently in the &quot;Angel&quot; spin-off where a supporting character (Eve) is described as a graduate of Kresge. Another alumnus, Richard Bandler, developed Neuro-Linguistic programming with one of his Kresge professors, John Grinder. Alumnus Doug Foster went on to become the editor of Mother Jones magazine and an Emmy Award-winning TV producer.

In 1987, a chicken, named Chick Chick, lived in/around the Octagon sextet, and was known to wander around campus looking for things to eat. Later, a loose pet hamster would unknowingly fall down a heating duct in the same sextet and die, producing a lingering foul smell every time the heat was turned on.

Kresge may also be a place where the Jewish Renewal movement was advanced as Reb Zalman-Schacter visited Professor Michael Kahn, one of the founders of humanistic psychology, several times in the early 1970s.

Adam Carson, drummer for the band AFI, lived in an apartment in Kresge his sophomore year of college which he &quot;spent all my time hanging out with Fritch at Stevenson. Then I dropped out and went on tour...&quot; He recalls it as &quot;the bigger mistake&quot; he made, after living at Rachel Carson College his freshman year.

Kresge symbolically &quot;seceded&quot; in April 1990 from the rest of the main university &quot;in the name of the environment ... [and] in the name of the Earth.&quot;

==Dining==

The closest dining hall is the Kresge/Porter dining hall in Porter College, with the Porter Slug Cafe (previously known as the Hungry Slug, and before that a worker&#x27;s collective called Sluggo&#x27;s Pizza) adjacent to the dining hall. The servery offers chef-customized traditional style entrees, signature salads, and pizzas. The dining hall is well known for having a variety of vegetarian and vegan options and also has a wonderful outside deck with a view of the adjacent Porter meadow and the Monterey Bay ocean view. Formerly, at the end of Kresge Upper Street was the Owl&#x27;s Nest, which acted as Kresge&#x27;s official cafe (the Slug being that of Porter). The cafe was well known for having exotic delicious fruits and vegetables smoothies. In addition, served serves a variety of entree options. Due to the Kresge Renewal Project, Owl&#x27;s Nest has been temporarily taken down until construction is complete.

<text>The following is the timeline of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people&#x27;s history.

==Before the Common Era==
=== 9th millennium BCE – 3rd millennium BCE ===
==== 101st century BCE – 50th century BCE ====
* 9,600 BCE – c, 5,000 BCE – Mesolithic rock art in the Grotta dell&#x27;Addaura in Sicily depicts male figures in hives that have been interpreted variously, including as hunters, acrobats, religious initiates, and gay sex.

==== 70th century BCE – 17th century BCE ====

* c. 7,000 BCE –1700 BCE – Among the sexual depictions in Neolithic and Bronze Age drawings and figurines from the Mediterranean area, as one author describes it, a &quot;third sex&quot; human figure having female breasts and male genitals or without distinguishing sex characteristics. In Neolithic Italy, female images are found in a domestic context, while images that combine sexual characteristics appear in burials or religious settings. In Neolithic Greece and Cyprus, figures are often dual-sexed or without identifying sexual characteristics.

===3rd millennium BCE===

====29th century BCE – 25th century BCE====
* c. 2900 BCE – c. 2500 BCE – A burial of a suburb of Prague, Czech Republic, a male is buried in the outfit usually reserved for women. Archaeologists speculate that the burial corresponds to a transgender person or someone of the third sex.

====24th century BCE====

* c. 2400 BCE – Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by some observers to be the first same-sex couple in recorded history, though others argue that they were brothers.

====23rd century BCE or 23rd century BCE – 22nd century BCE====

* 2284 BCE – 2246 BCE or 2184 BCE – Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled the Kingdom of Egypt as an absolute monarch under the title of Pharaoh of Egypt, is believed to have had a homosexual interpretation around nocturnal visits to his General Sasenet, though others argue that it was more likely that the story was intended to tarnish the reputation of the Pharaoh by associating him with homosexuality.

===2nd millennium BCE===
====18th century BCE====
* c. 1775 BCE – c. 1761 BCE – During the reign of King Zimri-Lim of the Kingdom of Mari, he is recorded to have male lovers.

====15th century BCE – 12th century BCE====
* c. 1500 BCE – c. 1101 BCE – The Code of Assura from either the Old Assyrian Empire or the Middle Assyrian Empire prescribes the following on male rape:


===1st millennium BCE===
====10th century BCE – 6th century BCE====
* c. 1000 BCE – c. 500 BCE – The Vendidad dates from this period and within the text it states the following:

 The guilty may be killed by any one, without an order from the Dastur, and by this execution an ordinary capital crime may be redeemed.

====7th century BCE====
* c. 700 BCE – The custom of castrating homosexual (and straight) slaves and house servants is introduced into Anshan from conquered territories of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Median Empire.
* c. 630 BCE – Dorian aristocrats in Crete adopt formal relations between adult aristocrats and adolescent boys; an inscription from Crete is the oldest record of the social institution of &quot;paiderastia&quot; among the Greeks (see Cretan pederasty). Marriage between men in Greece was not legally recognized, but men might form lifelong relationships originating in &quot;paiderastia&quot; (&quot;pederasty,&quot; without the pejorative connotations of the English word). These partnerships were not dissimilar to heterosexual marriages except that the older person served as educator or mentor.
* Sappho, a Greek lyric poet born on the island of Lesbos, was born between 630 and 612 BCE, and died around 570 BCE. The Alexandrians included her in the list of nine lyric poets. She was famous for her lesbian themes, giving her name and that of her homeland to the very definition of lesbianism (and the lesser used term of &quot;sapphism&quot;). She was exiled c. 600 BCE unrelated to lesbianism. She was later permitted to return.

====6th century BCE====
* 534 – 492 BCE – Duke Ling of Wey and Mizi Xia had a loving same-sex relationship, where various plays and stories have commemorated their love story in the phrase, &quot;the bitten peach&quot;.
* c. 540 – 530 BCE – Wall paintings from the Etruscan Tomb of the Bulls (Italian: &quot;Tomba dei Tori&quot;), found in 1892 in the Monterozzi necropolis, Tarquinia, depict homosexual intercourse. The tomb is named for the pair of bulls who watch human sex scenes, one between a man and a woman, and the other between two men; these may be apotropaic, or embody aspects of the cycle of regeneration and the afterlife. The three-chamber tomb was inscribed with the name of the deceased for whom it was originally built, Aranth Spurianas or Arath Spuriana, and also depicts Achilles killing the Trojan prince Troilus, along with indications of Apollo cult.
* 521 BCE – The Achaemenid Empire crucifies Polycrates and suppresses pederasty in Samos, which causes pederastic poets Ibycus and Anacreon to flee Samos.

====5th century BCE====

* c. 486 BCE – King Darius I adopts the Holiness Code of Leviticus for Persian Jews of the Achaemenid Empire, enacting the first ever state sanctioned death penalty for male same-sex relationships.
* c. 440 BCE – Herodotus publishes &quot;Histories&quot;, stating in the book that Persians welcomed foreign customs, including adopting pederasty from the Greeks.

====4th century BCE====
* 385 BCE – Plato publishes &quot;Symposium&quot; in which Phaedrus, Eryximachus, Aristophanes and other Greek intellectuals argue that love between males is the highest form, while sex with women is lustful and utilitarian. Socrates, however, differs. He demonstrates extreme self-control when seduced by the beautiful Alcibiades.
* 350 BCE – Plato publishes &quot;Laws&quot; in which the Athenian stranger and his companions criticize homosexuality as being lustful and wrong for society because it does not further the species and may lead to irresponsible citizenry.
* 346 BCE - Aeschines&#x27; speech Against Timarchus, who was on trial for male prostitution, reveals Athenian attitudes to homosexuality.
* 338 BCE – A thirteen year old prince Alexander III (the Great) meets a thirteen year old Hephaestion who would go on to be his life partner. 
* 338 BCE – The Sacred Band of Thebes, a previously undefeated elite battalion made up of one hundred and fifty pederastic couples, is destroyed by the forces of Philip II of Macedon who bemoans their loss and praises their honour.

====3rd or 2nd century BCE====
* 227 BCE, 226 BCE, 216 BCE, or 149 BCE – During the Roman Republic, the &quot;Lex Scantinia&quot; imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime &quot;(stuprum)&quot; against a freeborn youth; infrequently mentioned or enforced, it may also have been used to prosecute male citizens who willingly took the passive role in homosexual relations. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. For an adult male citizen to desire and engage in same-sex relations was considered natural and socially acceptable, as long as his partner was a male prostitute, slave or &quot;infamis&quot;, a person excluded from the legal protections accorded a citizen. In the Imperial period, the &quot;Lex Scantinia&quot; was revived by Domitian as part of his program of judicial and moral reform.

====1st century BCE====

* c. 90s – 80s BCE – Quintus Lutatius Catulus was among a circle of poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable in the late Republic. Both his surviving epigrams address a male as an object of desire, signaling a new homoerotic aesthetic in Roman culture.
* 57 – 54 BCE – Catullus writes the &quot;Carmina&quot;, including love poems to Juventius, boasting of sexual prowess with youth and violent invectives against &quot;passive&quot; homosexuals.
* c. 50 BCE – The &quot;Lex Julia de vi publica&quot;, a Roman Republic law, was passed to define rape as forced sex against &quot;boy, woman, or anyone&quot; and the rapist was subject to execution. Men who had been raped were exempt from the loss of legal or social standing suffered by those who submitted their bodies to use for the pleasure of others; a male prostitute or entertainer was &quot;infamis&quot; and excluded from the legal protections extended to citizens in good standing. As a matter of law, a slave could not be raped; he was considered property and not legally a person. The slave&#x27;s owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.
* 46 BCE – Lucius Antonius, the brother of Mark Antony, accuses Gaius Octavius for having &quot;given himself to Aulus Hirtius in Spain for three hundred thousand sesterces.&quot;
* 44 BCE – After the assassination of Dictator and Consul Gaius Julius Caesar, Gaius Octavius is publicly named in Caesar&#x27;s will as his adopted son and heir. According to Mark Antony, he charged that Octavius had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors.
* 42 – 39 BCE – Virgil writes the &quot;Eclogues&quot;, with Eclogue 2 a notable example of homoerotic Latin literature.
* 27 BCE – The Roman Empire is established under the rule of Augustus. The first recorded same-sex marriage occurs during his reign, homosexual prostitution is taxed, and if someone is caught being sexually passive with another male, a Roman citizen could lose his citizenship.
* 26, 25 and 18 BCE – Tibullus writes his elegies, with references to homosexuality.
* 7 – 1 BCE – Emperor Ai of Han had a loving same-sex relationship with Dong Xian. In one historical record, Emperor Ai cut his own sleeves to not wake up his beloved Dong Xian.

==Common Era==
===1st millennium===

====1st century====

* Philo of Alexandria and Marcus Manilius provided descriptions of transgender people during the early Roman Empire. Philo stated: &quot;Expending every possible care on their outward adornment, they are not ashamed even to employ every device to change artificially their nature as men into women&quot;. He also attested that some members of this group, to that end, had their penises removed.
* 5 –15 CE – The Warren Cup is made – a Roman silver drinking cup decorated in relief with two images of male same-sex acts.
* 37 – 41 – Under the reign of Roman emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, taxation on prostitution is enacted throughout the Roman Empire. Caligula also either exiled or contemplated exiling &quot;spintriae&quot; from Rome. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus reports that Caligula could only be restrained with difficulty, after lengthy pleadings, from having the &quot;spintriae&quot; thrown into the sea.
* 54 – Nero becomes Emperor of Rome. Nero married two men, Pythagoras and Sporus, in legal ceremonies, with Sporus accorded the regalia worn by the wives of the Caesars. Juvenal and Martial note (with disapproval) that male couples are having traditional marriage ceremonies.

* 98 – Trajan, one of the most beloved of Roman emperors, begins his reign. Trajan was well known for his homosexuality and fondness for young males. This was used to advantage by the king of Edessa, Abgar VII, who, after incurring the anger of Trajan for some misdeed, sent his handsome young son to make his apologies, thereby obtaining pardon.
:Publius Cornelius Tacitus writes &quot;Germania&quot;. In &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus writes that the punishment for those who engage in &quot;bodily infamy&quot; among the Germanic peoples is to &quot;smother in mud and bogs under an heap of hurdles.&quot; Tacitus also writes in &quot;Germania&quot; that the Germanic warrior-chieftains and their retinues were &quot;in times of peace, beauty, and in times of war, a defense&quot;. Tacitus later wrote in &quot;Germania&quot; that priests of the Swabian sub-tribe, the Naharvali or Nahanarvali, who &quot;dress as women&quot; to perform their priestly duties.

====2nd century====
* c. 200 – The &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot; is published. In the book, Sextus Empiricus states that &quot;amongst the Persians it is the habit to indulge in intercourse with males, but amongst the Romans it is forbidden by law to do so&quot;. He also stated in the book that &quot;amongst us sodomy is regarded as shameful or rather illegal, but by the Germanic they say, it is not looked on as shameful but as a customary thing. It is said, too, that in Thebes long ago this practice was not held to be shameful, and they say that Meriones the Cretan was so called by way of indicating the Cretans&#x27; customed and some refer to this the burning love of Achilles for Patroclus. And what wonder, when both the adherents of the Cynic philosophy and the followers of Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes and Chrysippus, declare that this practice is indifferent?&quot;.

At different times, Elagabalus marries five women and a man named Zoticus, an athlete from Smyrna, in a lavish public ceremony at Rome; but the Syrian&#x27;s most stable relationship is with the chariot driver Hierocles, and Cassius Dio says Elagabalus delighted in being called Hierocles&#x27; mistress, wife, and queen. The emperor wears makeup and wigs, prefers to be called a lady and not a lord, and offers vast sums to any physician who can provide them with a vagina; for this reason, the emperor is seen by some writers as an early transgender figure and one of the first on record as seeking sex reassignment surgery.
* 222 – 235 – Roman emperor Severus Alexander deported homosexuals who were active in public life. According to Christius, Alexander increased the penalties for homosexuality throughout the Roman Empire. According to Augustan History, Alexander decreed that the taxes on pimps, prostitutes, and &quot;exoleti&quot; should not be deposited in the public purse; instead, he ordered that these taxes should be used for restoring the theatre of Marcellus, the Circus Maximus, the amphitheatre, and the stadium build by Domitian in the Campus Martius. According to Ælius Lampridus, Alexander even contemplated making male prostitution illegal.

* 306 – 337 – The &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; mentions a temple at Aphaca in Phoenicia, on a remote summit of Mount Libanus, being used by effeminate homosexual pagan priests, and says that this temple was destroyed by the command of Roman emperor Constantine I.

<text>The National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada, commonly known as the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW), was one of Canada&#x27;s largest labour unions. In 2013, it merged with the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, forming a new union, Unifor. While rooted in Ontario&#x27;s large auto plants of Windsor, Brampton, Oakville, St. Catharines, and Oshawa, the CAW has expanded and now incorporates workers in almost every sector of the economy. The presidents of the CAW were Bob White (1985–1992), Buzz Hargrove (1992–2008), and Ken Lewenza (2008–2013).

==History==
===Split from UAW===
The CAW began as the Canadian Region of the United Auto Workers (UAW).

The UAW was founded in August 1935, and the Canadian Region of the UAW was established in 1937 following the 1937 GM Oshawa strike at General Motors&#x27;s Oshawa, Ontario plant. The Canadian Region of the UAW unionized the Ford Motor Company in 1945 after a major strike which established the right of Canadian labour union members to union dues checkoff. George Burt was the Canadian Director of the United Auto Workers (UAW) from 1939 to 1968. He is the longest-serving leader of the Canadian Union at 29 years. He pioneered many contractual issues that affected Canadian auto workers in the early years of the union movement.

The reasons for the CAW split from the UAW are complicated. Holmes and Rusonik (1990) contend that although the Canadian labour movement has been seen as traditionally more militant than its American counterpart, it was in fact the uneven geographical development of both management and labour led the Canadian auto-workers to develop a distinctly different set of collective bargaining objectives, which placed them in a far stronger bargaining position as compared to the UAW in the US, and, ultimately, brought about the events that led directly to the Split.
Two of the main forces demanding the restructuring of management and Labour during this time were the rise of Japan as a major automotive force, and the general recession of the world economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aided by the Auto Pact and the weakening Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar, a geographic difference developed which provided some relief to many Canadian auto-workers.

By December 1984, significant differences in the value of negotiated contracts, and divergent union objectives had set the stage for the creation of the CAW, a process documented in the Genie Award winning film, &quot;Final Offer&quot;. In 1984, the Canadian section of the UAW, under the leadership of Bob White and his assistants Buzz Hargrove and Bob Nickerson, broke from the UAW, led by Owen Bieber, because the American union was seen as giving away too much in the way of concessions during collective bargaining. Additionally, the UAW had been lobbying the US Congress to force the transfer of auto production from Canada to the US and the Canadian branch felt there was a lack of a representative voice during UAW&#x27;s conventions. By 1985 the split from the American union was complete and Bob White was acclaimed as the first President of the CAW. He served three terms as president..

===Politics===
After separation, the CAW began to grow quickly in size and stature. It merged with a number of smaller unions to double in size and become the largest private sector union in the country. Most notable were the mergers with the Fishermen, Food, and Allied Workers and the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport and General Workers (see CAW National Council 4000. The CAW also voiced strong opposition to the then-federal government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and such policies as the Goods and Services Tax and free trade.

In the case Fullowka et al. v. Royal Oak Ventures Inc, held in the aftermath of an 18-month strike at Royal Oak Mines in Yellowknife, the CAW was originally held responsible for 22% of damages at trial, before CAW was successful on appeal. The trial judge found that the union breached its duty of care by doing nothing to stop illegal acts during the strike, paying fines and legal fees for striking miners, providing a person to assist the miners&#x27; union who prolonged the strike, and failing to bargain in good faith. At trial, the court ruled that the cumulative effect of these breaches of the duty of care were found to have materially contributed to Roger Warren&#x27;s bombing of the mine, which killed nine strikebreaking workers. Warren, a union member who had been fired from Royal Oak, testified that he was only capable of the bombing because strike-breakers had been &quot;dehumanized&quot; by the union and was sentenced to life in prison. However, these findings of liability were overturned on appeal by the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal and a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Furthermore, CAW members Al Shearing and Tim Bettger were sentenced to two and a half and three years in prison, respectively. Both were convicted of painting anti-scab graffiti and setting an explosion in a ventilation shaft on June 29, 1992. Bettger was sentenced to an additional six months in prison for blowing a hole in a television satellite dish September 1 of that year. (The unioned miners were part of the Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers union (CASAW) Local 4 at the time of the strike, and merged into the CAW in May 1994.)
In 1998, the CAW was deeply involved in discussions with Volvo Canada Ltd. and the Government of Nova Scotia over the closure of the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant. In 2000, the CAW was expelled from the Canadian Labour Congress when several union locals left the SEIU and joined the CAW, prompting accusations of union raiding. A settlement was reached a year later that allowed the CAW to rejoin the national labour federation but relations with other unions such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Steel Workers of America and SEIU remain strained and the CAW remains outside of the Ontario Federation of Labour.

The CAW&#x27;s relationship with other unions has also been strained due to its different political direction. The CAW is strongly left leaning and it has traditionally been a strong supporter of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Bloc Québécois. However, under former leader Buzz Hargrove, it began lending its support to the Liberal Party in ridings which the NDP were unlikely to win in the recent federal elections.

The CAW has attempted several times, all unsuccessful, to organize Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. TMMC Assistant General Manager and spokesman Greig Mordue stated &quot;Our team members will decide whether or not a union best reflects their interest... At this point in time, we don&#x27;t think they have anything to gain from a union&quot;, and described the defeat of the union drive saying &quot;Our team members have recognized that a third party represents a complication they don&#x27;t need.&quot; Despite this, however, the CAW supported Mordue as the Liberal candidate in the 2006 federal election instead of endorsing the NDP&#x27;s Zoe Kunschner. Mordue attempted to take credit for bringing the new plant to Woodstock, but lost to Conservative incumbent Dave MacKenzie.

The 2006 federal election saw the governing Liberals lose power, despite CAW support. Afterwards, the Ontario NDP voted to expel Hargrove for supporting the Liberals, which automatically suspended his membership in the federal party. The CAW retaliated by severing all union ties with the NDP, a move formalized at the CAW&#x27;s 2006 convention.

===2008–2010 automotive crisis===

Industry analyst Anthony Faria has criticized the labour contracts that Canadian Auto Workers then-president Buzz Hargrove negotiated with the Big Three US automobile manufacturers in 2007, predicting that the subprime mortgage crisis and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that UAW president Ron Gettelfinger agreed to have the UAW&#x27;s &quot;all-in&quot; wage, benefit and pension costs drop from a high of $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW&#x27;s cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour by the end of the new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations &quot;with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them.&quot; Hargrove was said to have &quot;instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the auto makers buckle at the bargaining table&quot;.

Current union president Ken Lewenza has argued that labour is not responsible for the bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout. Lawenza argued that the CAW agreed in 2007 to make concessions that will save the Big Three $900 million over three years.

A spokesman for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW&#x27;s &quot;no-concession&quot; stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that &quot;It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do anything to help itself to begin with&quot;, since they &quot;fail to realize they&#x27;ve existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades&quot;. Kelly McParland, a columnist for the National Post, has suggested that &quot;if he won&#x27;t give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything.&quot; He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labour alike, criticizing labour for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).

The CTF has opposed the proposed CAD $3.5 billion bailout for Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, saying that it was an unfair financial burden on the average Canadian, as well as another excuse for the Detroit automakers to postpone much needed change. The CTF noted that federal and provincial governments spent $782-million in the past five years on the Big Three, saying &quot;These have been a bottomless pit of requests for cash&quot;. Lewenza disagreed, saying that the bailout should be seen by Canadians as a loan that will be paid back when the country&#x27;s economy is prosperous again.

On December 20, the governments of Canada and Ontario offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan GM was to receive $3 billion and Chrysler was to receive the rest. Ford only asked for a line of credit but did not be participating in the bailout.

The CAW negotiated a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract for an additional year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual &quot;special bonus,&quot; and reduce special paid absences or &quot;SPA days&quot; from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduced payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a &quot;major sacrifice.&quot; However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; Dominion Bond Rating Service analyst Kam Hon described it as &quot;not material.&quot; Automotive industry consultant Dennis DesRosiers said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs, pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen&#x27;s Park demanded cuts to the labour bill as a condition of the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking. He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that &quot;they [GM] got six or seven.&quot; when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in paid time off merely means &quot;five fewer spa days.&quot; University of Toronto professor Joe D&#x27;Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support. CAW autoworkers with seniority were able to maintain 10 weeks of vacation with full pay, while not contributing to their pension fund, relying instead on taxpayers (including these without pensions) to help make up their unfunded liabilities.

The agreement is contingent on Canada being allocated 20% of GM&#x27;s North American, and getting billions of dollars in federal and provincial taxpayer support, which Lewenza stressed will be loans. However, some suggested that this would not be the final time that automakers would request a bailout.
Dennis DesRosiers estimated that GM will go through its government loans in a couple of quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP Frank Valeriote that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the US government in order to secure the first tranche of a US$30 billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers&#x27; Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.
Chrysler vice-chairman and president Thomas W. LaSorda (himself the son of a CAW official) and Ford&#x27;s chief of manufacturing Joe Hinrichs said that the GM-CAW deal was insufficient, suggesting that they would break the CAW&#x27;s negotiating pattern set by GM. LaSorda told the House of Commons of Canada finance committee that he would demand an hourly wage cut of $20, suggested that Chrysler may withdraw from Canada if it fails to achieve more substantial cost savings from the CAW.


On March 31, 2009, the Canadian federal and Ontario governments jointly rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler. This came a day after US President Barack Obama had rejected the plans of their parent companies. Both federal Industry Minister Tony Clement and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty suggested the CAW&#x27;s initial deal was insufficient in cutting costs and the union had to return to the bargaining table to make further concessions. Both governments maintained that these were needed to make the business viable in order justify the use of taxpayers&#x27; money.
 Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne has asked that CAW wages be reduced to the levels of non-unionized workers from Honda and Toyota operating in Canada, or else they would walk away from the proposed alliance with Chrysler, resulting in the latter being forced into bankruptcy.

Following its emergence from Chapter 11, Chrysler returned to profitability, repaying some of its government loans.

===Unifor===
The Canadian Auto Workers voted in October 2012 to merge with the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada. The new merged union, Unifor, held its founding convention in August 2013.

===Films===

CAW President Bob White plays a major role in the 1985 documentary film: &quot;Final Offer&quot; by Sturla Gunnarsson &amp; Robert Collision. It follows the 1984 contract negotiations with General Motors that saw the CAW&#x27;s birth, and split with the UAW. It&#x27;s an interesting look at life on the shop floor of a car factory, along with the art of business negotiation.

===Donation to the University of Windsor===
The CAW Local 200 donated over $4 million towards the renovation of the University of Windsor&#x27;s student union building, which was renamed the CAW Student Centre in 1991 as recognition of the gift.

<doc id="477947" wikidata="Q7231602" url="?curid=477947" title="Porter College">
<text>Benjamin F. Porter College, known colloquially as Porter College, is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is located on the lower west side of the university, south of Kresge College and north of Rachel Carson College. The college was founded in 1969 as College Five and formally dedicated on November 21, 1981. On that day the college was given the motto &quot;Ars Longa, Vita Brevis&quot; (Art endures, Life is short), and a series of college symbols, including a faculty mace and a college bell, were inaugurated.

The faculty of the college has had a distinguished leadership. The provosts of the college have included the writer James B. Hall, the painter and psychologist Pavel Machotka, filmmaker Eli Hollander and composer David Cope. In early years, the college community was famous for Friday-afternoon sherry hours and afternoon croquet matches on the quad, suggesting that &quot;l&#x27;esprit de Santa Cruz&quot; was not far from that of Oxbridge.

==Description==
Situated on a meadow overlooking the Monterey Bay, Porter&#x27;s original focus was on the visual and performing arts with a unique college major in aesthetic studies (including areas like criticism, creative writing, film, photography and crafts which were not covered by the more traditional boards of study). Porter has long been a center for fine and performing arts. The college complex includes three active galleries, the History of Art and Visual Culture department, and various spaces in the complex have frequently been used for musical, theatrical, and dance performances. It also features a koi pond and cherry tree garden.

Although designed as a traditional dormitory with a centralized dining hall, Porter soon gained a reputation befitting their artistic background by staging outrageously bohemian parties, including Halloween, &quot;Step on My Face&quot;, &quot;The End&quot; (initially understood as &quot;The End of the World,&quot; but also in response to the changing of the name of the college from College Five to Porter, later revised to &quot;The End of the School Year,&quot; or &quot;The Edge of the World,&quot; and now &quot;Porterpalooza&quot;), and, for a time, a parodistic Prom (&quot;for all those who missed their High School Proms&quot;). &quot;Queer Fashion Show,&quot; formerly &quot;Alternative Fashion Show&quot; is a current annual program featuring student made fashion and a variety show. Porter is now also the home to several apartment buildings that are available to second year students and upper classmen. Currently, Freshmen and new Transfer students are not allowed to apply to live in the Porter Apartments.

While personnel surveillance is strong in the dormitory and adjoining quad area, rarely do CSOs or RAs patrol the Porter Meadow. Consequently, the Porter meadow is the primary spot for students smoking, drinking, or making noise in moderate to large groups.

===Traditions===

In the same vein, many students from this college take part in the First Rain yearly tradition, which is celebrated when the first rain of the Fall quarter falls. Students run naked through all colleges, much to the amusement of other students, to return to Porter College for warm showers. This tradition may have developed from a naked &quot;walkabout&quot; where roughly 50 Porterians and students from Kresge and (then) College 8 walked the colleges naked in October 1989 in part to relieve the stress of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The quake cancelled classes for days and UCSC students were left with little to do for distraction. 

Though Porter College&#x27;s reputation is associated with outrageous parties, bohemian lifestyles, and uninhibited artistic expression, presently the atmosphere at the college is much more subdued than in the past. Today, there are fewer Art majors at UCSC and thus fewer affiliated with Porter than in its earlier days. UCSC has also forced this break from reputation through stricter regulation and disciplinary action involving event planning, noise, lewdness, and drug policies. Like all colleges of UC Santa Cruz, these regulations are enforced by Coordinators for Residential Education (CREs), Residential Advisors (RAs), and Campus Security Officers (CSO). CREs live in the dormitory buildings and are responsible for discipline following campus policy violations as well as offering assistance and guidance to Porter students. RAs, college students living in the dorms, and CSOs, trained and hired personnel, patrol Porter College offering assistance in emergencies or writing referrals for policy violation.

===Transfer Community===
Porter College is also home to the Transfer Community. Using sections of both the large A and B buildings, the Transfer Community theme is home to nearly all transfer students who live on campus, regardless of college affiliation. Like most residential halls, the standard room option is a triple room with age-appropriate roommates. The addition of the Transfer Community has also greatly changed the culture and traditional arts-focus of Porter College as most of the transfer students are affiliated with other colleges.

===Landmarks===

Just to the south of Porter is a signature campus art piece, a large red abstract sculpture which has been endlessly portrayed on UCSC&#x27;s promotional literature. It is known on campus as &quot;The Squiggle,&quot; &quot;The Flying IUD&quot; and &quot;The Porter Wave&quot; in official literature, but is officially &quot;Untitled.&quot; Students often gather at this sculpture to play guitar, to watch the sunset, or to even drum on the sculpture itself. On Sundays students gather to participate in a mass Live-Action Role Playing, or LARPING.

Nearby the college is Empire Cave (and others in Cave Gulch, across Empire Grade from the campus) and Porter Meadow, which are popular local attractions. Empire Cave is notable for being the endemic stomping grounds of the Empire Cave Pseudoscorpion, the population of these arachnids being so small and isolated as to be primarily threatened by intrepid explorers, foolhardy party-goers, and psychedelic nomads looking for a &quot;trip.&quot;

The Porter Dining Hall is one of five dining halls on campus and is known to host events throughout the year. Fridays during the hot months of the year, Porter hosts its &quot;Patio Party&quot;, inviting students across campus to enjoy BBQ, &quot;mocktails&quot; and music.

==Dining==

The closest dining hall is the Kresge/Porter dining hall in Porter College, with the Porter Market (previously known as the Hungry Slug, and before that a worker&#x27;s collective called Sluggo&#x27;s Pizza) adjacent to the dining hall. The servery offers chef-customized traditional style entrees, signature salads, and pizzas. The dining hall is well known for having a variety of vegetarian and vegan options and also has a wonderful outside deck with a view of the adjacent Porter meadow and the Monterey Bay ocean view.

<doc id="477948" wikidata="Q464904" url="?curid=477948" title="Yinxu">
<text>Yinxu (; ) is a Chinese archeological site corresponding to Yin, the final capital of the Shang dynasty (). Located in present-day Anyang, Henan, Yin served as the capital during the Late Shang period () which spanned the reigns of 12 Shang kings and saw the emergence of oracle bone script, the earliest known Chinese writing. Along with oracle bone script and other material evidence for the Shang&#x27;s existence, the site was forgotten for millennia. Its rediscovery in 1899 resulted from an investigation into oracle bones that were discovered being sold nearby. The rediscovery of Yinxu marked the beginning of decades of intensive excavation and study. It is one of China&#x27;s oldest and largest archeological sites, and was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2006. Yinxu is located in northern Henan, near modern Anyang and the borders Henan shares with Hebei and Shanxi. Public access to the site is permitted.

==Traditional history==
According to the 2nd century &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; dictionary (說文解字), the Chinese character &quot;&quot; (&quot;yīn&quot;) originally referred to &quot;vibrant music-making&quot;. Although frequently used throughout written history to refer to both the Shang dynasty and its final capital, the name &quot;Yīn&quot; () appears to have not been used in this way until the succeeding Zhou dynasty. In particular, the name does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as &quot;Shāng&quot; (), and its final capital as &quot;Dàyì Shāng&quot; (大邑商 &quot;Great Settlement Shang&quot;).

Among surviving ancient Chinese historical documents, Yin is described as the final capital of the Shang dynasty. There is some disagreement, though, as to when the move to Yin took place. Both the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, (specifically, the &quot;Pan Geng&quot; chapter, which is believed to date from the late Spring and Autumn period), and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; state that Shang king Pan Geng moved the Shang capital to Yin. The Bamboo Annals state, more specifically, that during his reign Pan Geng moved the capital from Yān (奄; present-day Qufu, in present-day Shandong Province), to a site called Běimĕng (), where it was then renamed to Yīn (). (Conversely, according to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; of Sima Qian, Pan Geng moved the Shang capital from a location north of the Yellow River to Bo , the capital of Shang dynasty founder Tang, on the south side of the river—a location inconsistent with the location of Yin.)

Regardless, Yin was clearly established as the Shang capital by the time of Shang king Wu Ding. Wu Ding launched numerous military campaigns from this base against surrounding tribes, thus securing Shang rule and raising the dynasty to its historical zenith.

According to the traditional accounts, later rulers became pleasure-seekers who took no interest in state affairs. King Zhòu, the last of the Shang dynasty kings, is particularly remembered for his ruthlessness and debauchery. His increasingly autocratic laws alienated the nobility until King Wu of the Zhou dynasty was able to gain the support to rise up and overthrow the Shang.

The Zhou dynasty established their capital at Fenghao near modern-day Xi&#x27;an, and Yīn was abandoned to fall into ruin. These ruins were mentioned by Sima Qian in his &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, more precisely in the Battle of Julu, and described in some detail by Li Daoyuan in his &quot;Commentary to the River Classic&quot;, published during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420–589 CE). Thereafter, the once-great city of Yīn was relegated to legend along with its founding dynasty until its rediscovery in the final years of the Qing dynasty.
==Archaeological discoveries==
Yinxu is well known for its oracle bones, which were first recognized as containing ancient Chinese writing in 1899 by Wang Yirong, director of the Imperial Academy. One account of Wang&#x27;s discovery was that he was suffering from malaria at the time and was prescribed Longgu (龍骨) (&quot;dragon bones&quot;) at a traditional Chinese pharmacy. He noticed strange carvings on these bones and concluded that these could be samples of an ancient form of Chinese writing.

News of the discovery of the oracle bones created a market for them among antiques collectors, and led to multiple waves of illegal digs over several decades, with tens of thousands of pieces taken. The source of the &quot;dragon bones&quot; was eventually traced to the small village of Xiaotun, just outside Anyang. In 1910, noted scholar Luo Zhenyu affirmed that the area was the site of the last Shang dynasty capital. Canadian missionary and oracle bone analyst James Menzies also independently identified Anyang as the capital in 1910. In 1917, Wang Guowei deciphered the oracle bone inscriptions of the names of the Shang kings and constructed a complete Shang genealogy. This closely matched that in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian, confirming the historical authenticity of the legendary Shang dynasty and the archaeological importance of Yinxu.
However, the oracle bone inscriptions record the name of the state as Dàyìshāng () or Shāngyì ().

The first official archeological excavations at Yinxu were led by the archeologist Li Ji of the Institute of History and Philosophy from 1928–37. They uncovered the remains of a royal palace, several royal tombs, and more than 100,000 oracle bones that show the Shang had a well-structured script with a complete system of written signs.

Since 1950 ongoing excavations by the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have uncovered evidence of stratification at the Hougang site, remains of palaces and temples, royal cemeteries, oracle bone inscriptions, bronze and bone workshops and the discovery of the Huanbei site on the north bank of the Huan River. One of the largest and oldest sites of Chinese archaeology, excavations here have laid the foundation for work across the country.

Four periods are recognized at the site based on pottery types.
They correlate approximately with oracle bone periods assigned by Dong Zuobin, royal reigns and dates assigned by the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project as follows:

For most of Yinxu I, the site was a small settlement. The first large buildings appeared in the later part of the period, together with oracle bone inscriptions, large-scale human sacrifice and chariot burials.
Dong also included kings Pan Geng, Xiao Xin and Xiao Yi in his oracle bone period I, but no inscriptions can be reliably assigned to pre-Wu Ding reigns.
Some scholars assign these kings to the nearby Huanbei urban site, which was roughly contemporaneous with the early part of Yinxu I. Excavation at the latter site is complicated by the fact that it lies under Anyang airport, and no inscriptions have been found.

==Excavation sites==
At 30 square kilometers, Yinxu is the largest archaeological site in China. Excavations have uncovered over 80 rammed-earth foundation sites including palaces, shrines, tombs and workshops. From these remains archaeologists have been able to confirm that this was the spiritual and cultural center of the Shang dynasty.
The best preserved of the Shang dynasty royal tombs unearthed at Yinxu is the Tomb of Fu Hao. The extraordinary Lady Hao was a military leader and the wife of Shang King Wu Ding. The tomb was discovered in 1976 by Zheng Zhenxiang and has been dated to 1250 BCE. It was completely undisturbed, having escaped the looting that had damaged the other tombs on the site, and in addition to the remains of the Queen the tomb was discovered to contain six dog skeletons, 16 human slave skeletons, and numerous grave goods of huge archaeological value. The tomb was thoroughly excavated and extensively restored and is now open to the public. The exhibition hall also features chariot pits where the earliest samples of animal-driven carts discovered by Chinese archaeology are on display.

== Historical importance ==

Before the excavation of Yinxu, the Chinese historical record began in the first year of the subsequent Zhou dynasty, but the discovery of oracle bone inscriptions confirmed the historicity of the Shang, which had come under question. The framework of early ancient Chinese history was reconstructed, making it possible to assess the credibility of traditional accounts of Shang history.

The 150,000 oracle bones unearthed at Yinxu comprise much of the earliest evidence of written Chinese. Bronze and jade relics constitute evidence of the funeral customs of Yinxu, including human and animal sacrifice.

A large number of handicrafts and workshops have been discovered at Yinxu. Patterns on utensils and bronzeware include those resembling animal faces, whorl patterns, and the &quot;taotie&quot; pattern. Large-scale bronzeware excavated at the site like the Houmuwu &quot;ding&quot; were cast by an elaborate section-mold process.

==Genetic studies==
A study of mitochondrial DNA (inherited in the maternal line) from Yinxu graves showed similarity with modern northern Han Chinese, but significant differences from southern Han Chinese.

<doc id="477954" wikidata="Q31726" url="?curid=477954" title="Cease and desist">
<text>A cease and desist letter is a document sent by one party, often a business, to warn another party that they believe the other party is committing an unlawful act, such as copyright infringement, and that they will take legal action if the other party continues the alleged unlawful activity. The letter may warn that, if the recipient does not discontinue specified conduct, or take certain actions, by deadlines set in the letter, the letter&#x27;s recipient may be sued. The phrase &quot;cease and desist&quot; is a legal doublet, made up of two near-synonyms. A cease and desist letter issued by a government entity, called a cease and desist order, is &quot;a warning of impending judicial enforcement&quot;.

==Usage for intellectual property==

Although cease and desist letters are not exclusively used in the area of intellectual property, particularly in regards to copyright infringement, such letters &quot;are frequently utilized in disputes concerning intellectual property and represent an important feature of the intellectual property law landscape&quot;. The holder of an intellectual property right such as a copyrighted work, a trademark, or a patent, may send the cease and desist letter to inform a third party &quot;of the right holder&#x27;s rights, identity, and intentions to enforce the rights&quot;. The letter may merely contain a licensing offer or may be an explicit threat of a lawsuit. A cease and desist letter often triggers licensing negotiations, and is a frequent first step towards litigation.

==Effects on recipients==

Receiving numerous cease and desist letters may be very costly for the recipient. Each claim in the letters must be evaluated, and it should be decided whether to respond to the letters, &quot;whether or not to obtain an attorney&#x27;s opinion letter, prepare for a lawsuit, and perhaps initiate [in case of letters regarding a potential patent infringement] a search for alternatives and the development of design-around technologies.&quot;

Cease and desist letters are sometimes used to intimidate recipients and can be &quot;an effective tool used by corporations to chill the critical speech of gripe sites operators&quot;. A company owning a trademark may send such letter to a gripe site operator alleging a trademark infringement, although the actual use of the trademark by the gripe site operator may fall under a fair use exception (in compliance with, in the U.S., the protection of free speech under the First Amendment).

==Notable cease and desist letters==
===2000s===
To prevent genericizing and potential loss of its trademark, Google has discouraged use of the word as a verb, particularly when used as a synonym for general web searching. On February 23, 2003, Google sent a cease and desist letter to Paul McFedries, creator of Word Spy, a website that tracks neologisms. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Frank Ahrens discussed the letter he received from a Google lawyer that demonstrated &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot; ways to use the verb &quot;google&quot;.

===2010s===
Author Patrick Wensink used Jack Daniel&#x27;s famous branding without licensing as a cover for his 2012 book &quot;Broken Piano for President&quot;. Jack Daniel&#x27;s requested only future printings of the book to have the cover changed and offered compensation.

In September 2012, AwardWallet, TripIt and MileWise received a number of cease and desist letters from American Airlines, Delta, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, demanding that companies discontinue accessing their websites for tracking clients&#x27; miles rewards programs.

In 2017, a cease and desist letter sent by Netflix for an unauthorized &quot;Stranger Things&quot;-related bar event was noted by news outlets such as &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Quartz&quot; for its humorous wording.

===2020s===
The Philippine National Telecommunications Commission administered a cease and desist order against ABS-CBN to stop broadcasting on May 5, 2020 after its franchise expired the day before (May 4, 2020). At 7:52 pm (PHT), ABS-CBN stopped its broadcast in compliance with the NTC&#x27;s letter, signing off all of its free TV and radio stations across the country (ABS-CBN Channel 2, S+A Channel 23, DZMM 630, and MOR 101.9). The said agency also gave ABS-CBN ten days to explain why its assigned frequencies should not be recalled. On June 30, 2020, considering that Channel 43 was also included in the May 5, 2020 shutdown order issued by the NTC against ABS-CBN (although ABS-CBN CEO Carlo L. Katigbak insisted that it is part of their blocktime agreement with AMCARA Broadcasting Network), the NTC and Solicitor General Jose Calida released two alias cease-and-desist orders against Channel 43 on digital TV receiver ABS-CBN TV Plus and Sky Cable&#x27;s nationwide satellite service Sky Direct to cease further operations.

Donald Trump sent a cease and desist letter to CNN asking them to retract a poll that showed him being 14 percentage points behind his opponent Joe Biden during the presidential election, prompting &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to warn about attacks on the media.

In 2021, Google&#x27;s platform YouTube issued a significant number of cease and desist notices to the creators of various music bots on Discord, such as Rythm and Groovy. These music bots allowed users to request songs and have the bot create a queue. This was done by pulling the audio stream from various streaming and video platforms, including YouTube, and then played that audio on the Discord voice channel. Because such music bots did not play any of the advertisements included on the video-hosting site, the company alleged missing revenue for itself and the content uploaders. A spokesperson for Google told &quot;The Verge&quot; that Groovy violated YouTube&#x27;s terms of service for &quot;modifying the service and using it for commercial purposes&quot;. The makers of Groovy had decided to comply with Google&#x27;s request by shutting down the bot on August 30, 2021. According to estimations, the bot had more than 250 million users.

In 2022, Disney issued a letter of cease and desist to the creators of &quot;Club Penguin Rewritten&quot;, a game that was created as a remake of &quot;Club Penguin&quot; after its shutdown on March 31, 2017.

Google issued a letter of cease and desist to the creators of YouTube Vanced, an Android app developed as a third-party modification of YouTube. The app, which utilizes apk (file format), allowed its users to skip advertisements, among other functions. Since March 13, 2022, the app has been discontinued, with all links being removed.

On January 22, 2024, the National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease-and-desist order to Sonshine Media Network International, citing its failure to comply with the original 30-day suspension order issued by the said agency.

Nintendo issued a letter of cease and desist to the creators of Yuzu, a video game console emulator for the Nintendo Switch. The program allowed its users to not pay or participate in grinding for downloadable content, such as all of its Booster Course Passes and a Gold Mario for Mario Kart 8. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was released May 12, 2023; however, an internet leak was discovered on file hosting site https://nyaa.si/ dated May 1, 2023. The file can then be read by Ryujinx, a Nintendo Switch emulator.

<text>JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDSU) was an American company that designed and manufactured products for optical communications networks, communications test and measurement equipment, lasers, optical solutions for authentication and decorative applications, and other custom optics. It was headquartered in Milpitas, California. In August 2015, JDSU split into two different companies – Viavi Solutions and Lumentum Holdings.

==History==
Uniphase was started in 1979 in a San Jose, California garage, and made lasers for chip makers and scanners.

In 1981, JDS Optics was founded in Ottawa, Ontario by Philip Garel-Jones, Gary Duck, Jozef Straus, and Bill Sinclair. The &quot;JDS&quot; is short for Jones, Duck and Straus/Sinclair. The company became JDS Fitel when it formed a partnership with Fitel, a fiber optic and optical connector company.

In 1999, JDSU was formed by the merger between JDS Fitel and Uniphase, and it became known as JDS Uniphase subsequent to the merger.

Three other major fiber companies were acquired by JDS Uniphase during the telecom boom – Optical Coating Laboratory Inc. (OCLI), bought for $6.2 billion and based in Santa Rosa, California, E-TEK Dynamics, bought for $15 billion, and SDL, bought for $45 billion, both based in San Jose, California.

In 2003, CEO Straus retired, and the company moved its headquarters to San Jose, California, to consolidate its business.

On August 3, 2005, the company acquired test and measurement equipment company Acterna for $760 million, which became part of JDSU&#x27;s Test and Measurement Group. Acterna had been formed by the May 2000 merger of network test solutions developer Wavetek Wandel Goltermann (WWG) and hand-held test equipment developer TTC.

In 2006, the company moved its headquarters to Milpitas, California.

In December 2013, the company announced it was acquiring fellow network performance management company Network Instruments, for $200 million.

On August 1, 2015, JDSU split into Viavi Solutions and Lumentum Holdings Inc.

===Stock===
During the 1990s, JDS Uniphase stock was a high-flyer tech stock investor favorite. Its stock price doubled three times and three stock splits of 2:1 occurred roughly every 90 days during the last half of 1999 through early 2000, making millionaires of many employees who were stock option holders, and further enabling JDS Uniphase to go on an acquisition and merger binge. After a downturn in the telecom industry as part of the dot com bubble, JDS Uniphase announced in late July 2001 the largest (up to then) write-down of goodwill. Employment soon dropped as part of the Global Realignment Program from nearly 29,000 to approximately 5,300, many of its factories and facilities were closed around the world, and the stock price dropped from $153 per share to less than $2 per share.

On September 23, 2005, JDSU announced a reverse stock split one-to-eight.

===Shareholder litigation===
After the 2001 crash of the telecommunications industry, the state of Connecticut filed a lawsuit against the company and four key executives, claiming that they had misled and hid from company shareholders advance knowledge of the company&#x27;s impending downturn. Unlike most similar lawsuits, which are dismissed or settled before trial, Connecticut&#x27;s lawsuit went to trial in October, 2007. JDSU was acquitted of all charges in November, 2007.

<text>Martha Mills Noxon (born August 25, 1964) is an American television and film writer, director, and producer. She is best known for her work as a screenwriter and executive producer on the supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). She was also executive producer, writer, and creator of the Bravo comedy-drama series &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce&quot; (2014–18) and the Lifetime drama series &quot;UnREAL&quot; (2015–18), and an executive producer of the CBS medical drama series &quot;Code Black&quot; (2015–17).

Noxon also wrote the science fiction action film &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; (2011), the horror thriller film &quot;Fright Night&quot; (2011), and the biographical drama film &quot;The Glass Castle&quot; (2017). She wrote and directed the drama film &quot;To the Bone&quot; (2017).

Noxon created the AMC dark comedy series &quot;Dietland&quot; and the HBO limited series &quot;Sharp Objects&quot;, both of which premiered in 2018.

== Early life ==
Noxon was born in Los Angeles, California, to National Geographic documentary filmmaker father, Nicolas Noxon, and Mary Straley. Noxon has said that she grew up in nearby Santa Monica, and that her mother was gay. She has a brother, Christopher Noxon, who is a writer and was previously married to TV writer Jenji Kohan. Her grandmother was painter Betty Lane. Noxon would often accompany her father when he traveled to shoot documentary films and was already in love with the idea of movies.

Noxon graduated from Oakes College at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1987 with a B.A. in Theater Arts.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Initially Noxon wanted to be an actor because it seemed glamorous, but after trying for a while realized it was not something that she wanted to do. She said that she had always been told that writing was her strength, and eventually that was what she focused on.

She met producer Rick Rosenthal while working as a waitress and eventually became his assistant. She then became TV writer Barbara Hall&#x27;s assistant. Noxon said that Hall was a strong mentor in what is an informal mentorship that writers sometimes find. Noxon had written a senior thesis project that was required for her major in college, then forgot about it for four years. She reconnected with the material and showed it to a producer, who tried to get it made. She counts this as the beginning of her writing career. She then sold something early on (which was never made). Following this, she spent seven years writing on her own, developing her abilities as a writer, before she got onto &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;

Although the industry at the time was all about the log line, which was very successful for writers like Joss Whedon, Noxon had to go through a process where she discarded that construct and got in touch with the vision that she felt connected to — and realised that all of the work she had been doing was in a vacuum. As a result, Noxon began writing plays and getting actors to speak her lines in order to get feedback and improve her writing. She said that for her it was about voice, not concept.

=== &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; ===
After the first season of episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; were produced, Noxon&#x27;s agent encouraged her to watch them and try to take meetings and get on the show. Noxon was skeptical as she wasn&#x27;t wowed by the concept, and knew the original film hadn&#x27;t done well. After watching the initial episodes, she realized she loved the show, but was already booked to work on &quot;The Pretender,&quot; which was picked up to air, so seemed like it was a more safe bet.

In 1997, Noxon joined the writing staff of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; for its second season. During her tenure there, she wrote or co-wrote 22 episodes of the series, half of these during her first two years on the show. Noxon described her experience on &quot;Buffy&quot; as charmed, as The WB Network allowed the show creators to work with little interference. The pace of the writing was extremely fast, with deadlines from 3 weeks to sometimes 4 days.

In 1998, beginning with its third season, Noxon became a co-producer of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In 1999, upon the beginning of &quot;Buffy&quot; spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, Noxon was promoted by series creator Joss Whedon to supervising producer for its fourth season, which gave her increasing charge of producing &quot;Buffy&quot;. During this season, Noxon cast Amber Benson as Tara Maclay.

Noxon co-produced the show over its fifth season (2000–2001) with fellow executive co-producer David Fury, as well as direct two episodes (&quot;Into the Woods&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot;). She made a singing appearance in the sixth-season episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;. At the season&#x27;s conclusion, fan reaction was mixed, leading some to criticize Whedon for abandoning creative control and stewardship of &quot;Buffy&quot; to Noxon. In response, Whedon said:

Noxon was executive producer of &quot;Buffy&quot; between 2001 and 2003, for its sixth and seventh seasons.

=== Other projects ===
In 2004, Noxon wrote and produced a pilot entitled &quot;Still Life&quot; for Fox about a family recovering from the death of their son, a police officer. Despite being picked up to series the show has never been aired in the U.S as FOX cancelled the show after seven episodes were produced, due to the subject matter.

In January 2005, Noxon co-created the supernatural drama &quot;Point Pleasant&quot; with John McLaughlin. Despite an initial strong following, viewership dropped dramatically, and only 11 of the 13 filmed episodes were aired on Fox. In the fall of 2005, halfway through its first season, Noxon left &quot;Prison Break&quot;, where she had been a consulting producer. She said she wasn&#x27;t connecting with the material and the vision of the writer&#x27;s room.

In April 2006, Noxon joined the ABC drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; as showrunner. Four months later, she left the show. Press cited creative differences with creator Jon Robin Baitz, but he acknowledged differing visions and being new to the process of creating scripted television, said he was struggling with the practicalities of working on his first TV show. Greg Berlanti, Baitz&#x27; friend, stepped in to help out. In September 2006, Noxon joined the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; for its third season, as consulting producer. In February 2007, Noxon co-wrote the third-season &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; with series creator Shonda Rhimes.

In April 2007, Noxon left &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; to become executive producer and showrunner for &quot;Grey&#x27;s&quot; spinoff &quot;Private Practice&quot;, which she did for one season. In late 2007, Noxon served as head writer during the first season of &quot;Private Practice&quot;.

In 2008, Noxon worked as a consulting producer on the AMC drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot;. Noxon said that working with Matthew Weiner was a dream, that it took her writing to a whole different level, and that with feedback from Weiner, was able to break herself of some habits that became ingrained after working on different shows for a while, like focusing on the theme of the show, etc. With Weiner on &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Noxon said she was able to re-connect with the purpose of writing better, and become more connected to what she was writing about. In 2008, Noxon co-wrote a second-season episode of the AMC drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, for which she was nominated for a 2009 Writers Guild of America Award for Best Dramatic Series. She won the WGA Award for Best Drama Series (after being nominated for the second consecutive year) at the February 2010 ceremony for her work on the third season of &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

In 2011, Noxon joined the writing team of FOX&#x27;s &quot;Glee&quot; for its third season, she did not return for its fourth season.

In 2014, Noxon, along with co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, began working on the Lifetime comedy-drama series &quot;UnREAL&quot;. While working on &quot;UnREAL&quot;, Noxon was also working on Bravo&#x27;s first original scripted TV series &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce&quot;. Noxon is also one of the executive producers of the CBS medical drama series &quot;Code Black&quot; which premiered in the fall of 2015.

=== Film ===
In 1999, Noxon co-wrote &quot;Just a Little Harmless Sex&quot; with Roger Mills.

She wrote the screenplay of the 2011 remake of &quot;Fright Night&quot;, directed by Craig Gillespie.

She wrote and directed the 2017 film &quot;To the Bone&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Noxon met her now ex-husband Jeff Bynum while they were both working on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; She has two children.

Noxon said that her show, &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce,&quot; is not about her divorce, but is about divorce.

One of her hobbies is baking. As part of that interest, she opened a flour mill in Pasadena, California, called Grist &amp; Toll that supplies local restaurants with ground flour for baking.

<text>The sexagenary cycle, also known as the ganzhi or stems-and-branches is a cycle of sixty terms, each corresponding to one year, thus a total of sixty years for one cycle, historically used for recording time in China and the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere and Southeast Asia. It appears as a means of recording days in the first Chinese written texts, the oracle bones of the late second millennium BC Shang dynasty. Its use to record years began around the middle of the 3rd century BC. The cycle and its variations have been an important part of the traditional calendrical systems in Chinese-influenced Asian states and territories, particularly those of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, with the old Chinese system still in use in Taiwan, and in Mainland China. In India, the Ahom people (descendants of the Dai people of Yunnan who migrated to Assam in the 13th century) also used the sexagenary cycle known as Lak-Ni.

This traditional method of numbering days and years no longer has any significant role in modern Chinese time-keeping or the official calendar. However, the sexagenary cycle is used in the names of many historical events, such as the Chinese Xinhai Revolution, the Japanese Boshin War, the Korean Imjin War and the Vietnamese Famine of Ất Dậu, Tết Mậu Thân. It also continues to have a role in contemporary Chinese astrology and fortune telling. There are some parallels in this with Tamil calendar.

==Overview==
Each term in the sexagenary cycle consists of two Chinese characters, the first being one of the ten Heavenly Stems of the Shang-era week and the second being one of the twelve Earthly Branches representing the years of Jupiter&#x27;s orbital cycle. The first term &quot;jiǎzǐ&quot; () combines the first heavenly stem with the first earthly branch. The second term &quot;yǐchǒu&quot; () combines the second stem with the second branch. This pattern continues until both cycles conclude simultaneously with &quot;guǐhài&quot; (), after which it begins again at &quot;jiǎzǐ&quot;. This termination at ten and twelve&#x27;s least common multiple leaves half of the combinations—such as &quot;jiǎchǒu&quot; ()—unused; this is traditionally explained by reference to pairing the stems and branches according to their yin and yang properties.

This combination of two sub-cycles to generate a larger cycle and its use to record time have parallels in other calendrical systems, notably the Akan calendar.

==History==

The sexagenary cycle is attested as a method of recording days from the earliest written records in China, records of divination on oracle bones, beginning . Almost every oracle bone inscription includes a date in this format. This use of the cycle for days is attested throughout the Zhou dynasty and remained common into the Han period for all documentary purposes that required dates specified to the day.

Almost all the dates in the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, a chronological list of events from 722 to 481 BC, use this system in combination with regnal years and months (lunations) to record dates. Eclipses recorded in the Annals demonstrate that continuity in the sexagenary day-count was unbroken from that period onwards. It is likely that this unbroken continuity went back still further to the first appearance of the sexagenary cycle during the Shang period.

The use of the sexagenary cycle for recording years is much more recent. The earliest discovered documents showing this usage are among the silk manuscripts recovered from Mawangdui tomb 3, sealed in 168 BC. In one of these documents, a sexagenary grid diagram is annotated in three places to mark notable events. For example, the first year of the reign of Qin Shi Huang (), 246 BC, is noted on the diagram next to the position of the 60-cycle term &quot;yǐmǎo&quot; (, 52 of 60), corresponding to that year. Use of the cycle to record years became widespread for administrative time-keeping during the Western Han dynasty (202 BC – 8 AD). The count of years has continued uninterrupted ever since: the year 1984 began the present cycle (a —&quot;jiǎzǐ&quot; year), and 2044 will begin another. Note that in China the new year, when the sexagenary count increments, is not January 1, but rather the lunar new year of the traditional Chinese calendar. For example, the &quot;jichou&quot; year (coinciding roughly with 2009) began on January 26, 2009. (However, for astrology, the year begins with the first solar term &quot;Lìchūn&quot; (), which occurs near February 4.)

In Japan, according to &quot;Nihon shoki&quot;, the calendar was transmitted to Japan in 553. But it was not until the Suiko era that the calendar was used for politics. The year 604, when the Japanese officially adopted the Chinese calendar, was the first year of the cycle.

The Korean ( hwangap) and Japanese tradition ( &quot;kanreki&quot;) of celebrating the 60th birthday (literally &#x27;return of calendar&#x27;) reflects the influence of the sexagenary cycle as a count of years.

The Tibetan calendar also counts years using a 60-year cycle based on 12 animals and 5 elements, but while the first year of the Chinese cycle is always &quot;jiǎzǐ&quot; (the year of the Wood Rat), the first year of the Tibetan cycle is &quot;dīngmǎo&quot; (; year 4 on the Chinese cycle, year of the Fire Rabbit).

==Sexagenary years==

==Conversion between cyclic years and Western years==

As mentioned above, the cycle first started to be used for indicating years during the Han dynasty, but it also can be used to indicate earlier years retroactively. Since it repeats, by itself it cannot specify a year without some other information, but it is frequently used with the Chinese era name (; ) to specify a year. The year starts with the new year of whoever is using the calendar. In China, the cyclic year normally changes on the Chinese Lunar New Year. In Japan until recently it was the Japanese lunar new year, which was sometimes different from the Chinese; now it is January 1. So when calculating the cyclic year of a date in the Gregorian year, one has to consider what their &quot;new year&quot; is. Hence, the following calculation deals with the Chinese dates &quot;after&quot; the Lunar New Year in that Gregorian year; to find the corresponding sexagenary year in the dates before the Lunar New Year would require the Gregorian year to be decreased 

As for example, the year 2697 BC (or −2696, using the astronomical year count), traditionally the first year of the reign of the legendary Yellow Emperor, was the first year (甲子; &quot;jiǎzǐ&quot;) of a cycle. 2700 years later in 4 AD, the duration equivalent to 45 60-year cycles, was also the starting year of a 60-year cycle. Similarly 1980 years later, 1984 was the start of a new cycle.

Thus, to find out the Gregorian year&#x27;s equivalent in the sexagenary cycle use the appropriate method below.
# For any year number greater than 4 AD, the equivalent sexagenary year can be found by subtracting 3 from the Gregorian year, dividing by 60 and taking the remainder. See example below. 
# For any year before 1 AD, the equivalent sexagenary year can be found by adding 2 to the Gregorian year number (in BC), dividing it by 60, and subtracting the remainder from 60. 
# 1 AD, 2 AD and 3 AD correspond respectively to the 58th, 59th and 60th years of the sexagenary cycle.
#The formula for years AD is and for years BC is .
The result will produce a number between 0 and 59, corresponding to the year order in the cycle; if the remainder is 0, it corresponds to the 60th year of a cycle. Thus, using the first method, the equivalent sexagenary year for 2012 AD is the 29th year (壬辰; &quot;rénchén&quot;), as &quot;(2012–3) mod 60 = 29&quot; (i.e., the remainder of (2012–3) divided by 60 is 29). Using the second, the equivalent sexagenary year for 221 BC is the 17th year (庚辰; &quot;gēngchén&quot;), as &quot;60- [(221+2) mod 60] = 17&quot; (i.e., 60 minus the remainder of (221+2) divided by 60 is 17).

===Examples===
Step-by-step example to determine the sign for 1967:
#1967 – 3 = 1964 (&quot;subtracting 3 from the Gregorian year&quot;)
#1964 ÷ 60 = 32 (&quot;divide by 60 and discard any fraction&quot;)
#1964 – (60 × 32) = 44 (&quot;taking the remainder&quot;)
#Show one of the Sexagenary Cycle tables (the following section), look for 44 in the first column (No) and obtain Fire Goat (丁未; &quot;dīngwèi&quot;).

Step-by-step example to determine the cyclic year of first year of the reign of Qin Shi Huang (246 BC):
#246 + 2 = 248 (&quot;adding 2 to the Gregorian year number (in BC)&quot;)
#248 ÷ 60 = 4 (&quot;divide by 60 and discard any fraction&quot;)
#248 – (60 × 4) = 8 (&quot;taking the remainder&quot;)
#60 – 8 = 52 (&quot;subtract the remainder from 60&quot;)
#Show one of the Sexagenary Cycle table (the following section), look for 52 in the first column (No) and obtain Wood Rabbit (乙卯; &quot;yǐmǎo&quot;).

===A shorter equivalent method===
Start from the AD year (1967), take directly the remainder mod 60, and look into column AD of the table &quot;Sexagenary years&quot; (just above).
*1967 = 60 × 32 + 47. 
Remainder is therefore 47 and the AD column says &#x27;Fire Goat&#x27; as it should be.

For a BC year: discard the minus sign, take the remainder of the year mod 60 and look into column BC. Applied to year -246, this gives:
*246 = 60 × 4 + 6. Remainder is therefore 6 and the BC column of table &quot;Sexagenary years&quot; (just above) gives &#x27;Wood Rabbit&#x27;.
When doing these conversions, year 246 BC cannot be treated as −246 AD due to the lack of a year 0 in the Gregorian AD/BC system.
The following tables show recent years (in the Gregorian calendar) and their corresponding years in the cycles:

===1804–1923===
===1924–2043===
==Sexagenary months==
The branches are used marginally to indicate months. Despite there being twelve branches and twelve months in a year, the earliest use of branches to indicate a twelve-fold division of a year was in the 2nd century BC. They were coordinated with the orientations of the Big Dipper, (: &quot;jiànzǐyuè&quot;, : &quot;jiànchǒuyuè&quot;, etc.). There are two systems of placing these months, the lunar one and the solar one.

One system follows the ordinary Chinese lunar calendar and connects the names of the months directly to the central solar term (; &quot;zhōngqì&quot;). The &quot;jiànzǐyuè&quot; (()) is the month containing the winter solstice (i.e. the Dōngzhì) &quot;zhōngqì&quot;. The &quot;jiànchǒuyuè&quot; (()) is the month of the following &quot;zhōngqì&quot;, which is Dàhán (), while the &quot;jiànyínyuè&quot; (()) is that of the Yǔshuǐ () &quot;zhōngqì&quot;, etc. Intercalary months have the same branch as the preceding month.
In the other system (; &quot;jiéyuè&quot;) the &quot;month&quot; lasts for the period of two solar terms (two &quot;qìcì&quot;). The &quot;zǐyuè&quot; () is the period starting with Dàxuě (), i.e. the solar term &quot;before&quot; the winter solstice. The &quot;chǒuyuè&quot; () starts with Xiǎohán (), the term before Dàhán (), while the &quot;yínyuè&quot; () starts with Lìchūn (), the term before Yǔshuǐ (), etc. Thus in the solar system a month starts anywhere from about 15 days before to 15 days after its lunar counterpart.

The branch names are not usual month names; the main use of the branches for months is astrological. However, the names are sometimes used to indicate historically which (lunar) month was the first month of the year in ancient times. For example, since the Han dynasty, the first month has been &quot;jiànyínyuè&quot;, but earlier the first month was &quot;jiànzǐyuè&quot; (during the Zhou dynasty) or &quot;jiànchǒuyuè&quot; (traditionally during the Shang dynasty) as well.

For astrological purposes stems are also necessary, and the months are named using the sexagenary cycle following a five-year cycle starting in a &quot;jiǎ&quot; (; 1st) or &quot;jǐ&quot; (; 6th) year. The first month of the &quot;jiǎ&quot; or &quot;jǐ&quot; year is a &quot;bǐngyín&quot; (; 3rd) month, the next one is a &quot;dīngmǎo&quot; (; 4th) month, etc., and the last month of the year is a &quot;dīngchǒu&quot; (, 14th) month. The next year will start with a &quot;wùyín&quot; (; 15th) month, etc. following the cycle. The 5th year will end with a &quot;yǐchǒu&quot; (; 2nd) month. The following month, the start of a &quot;jǐ&quot; or &quot;jiǎ&quot; year, will hence again be a &quot;bǐngyín&quot; (3rd) month again. The beginning and end of the (solar) months in the table below are the approximate dates of current solar terms; they vary slightly from year to year depending on the leap days of the Gregorian calendar.
==Sexagenary days==

*N for the year: (5y + [y/4]) mod 10, y = 0–39 (stem); (5y + [y/4]) mod 12, y = 0–15 (branch)
*N for the Gregorian century: (4c + [c/4] + 2) mod 10 (stem); (8c + [c/4] + 2) mod 12 (branch), c ≥ 15 
*N for the Julian century: 5c mod 10, c = 0–1 (stem); 9c mod 12, c = 0–3 (branch)
The table above allows one to find the stem &amp; branch for any given date. For both the stem and the branch, find the N for the row for the century, year, month, and day, then add them together. If the sum for the stems&#x27; N is above 10, subtract 10 until the result is between 1 and 10. If the sum for the branches&#x27; N is above 12, subtract 12 until the result is between 1 and 12.

For any date before October 15, 1582, use the Julian century column to find the row for that century&#x27;s N. For dates after October 15, 1582, use the Gregorian century column to find the century&#x27;s N. When looking at dates in January and February of leap years, use the bold &amp; italic Feb and Jan.

===Examples===
* Step-by-step example to determine the stem-branch for October 1, 1949.
**Stem 
***(day stem N + month stem N + year stem N + century stem N) = number of stem. If over 10, subtract 10 until within 1 – 10.
****Day 1: N = 1,
****Month of October: N = 1,
****Year 49: N = 7, 
*****49 isn&#x27;t on the table, so we&#x27;ll have to mod 49 by 40. This gives us year 9, which we can follow to find the N for that row.
****Century 19: N = 2. 
***(1 + 1 + 7 + 2) = 11. This is more than 10, so we&#x27;ll subtract 10 to bring it between 1 and 10. 
****11 – 10 = 1,

<text>Margaret Nixon McEathron (February 22, 1930 – July 24, 2016), known professionally as Marni Nixon, was an American soprano and ghost singer for featured actresses in musical films. She was the singing voice of leading actresses on the soundtracks of several musicals, including Deborah Kerr in &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;, Natalie Wood in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and Audrey Hepburn in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, although her roles were concealed from audiences when the films were released. Several of the songs she dubbed appeared on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs list.

Besides her voice work in films, Nixon&#x27;s career included roles of her own in film, television, opera and musicals on Broadway and elsewhere throughout the United States, performances in concerts with major symphony orchestras, and recordings.

==Early life==
Born in Altadena, California, to Charles Nixon and Margaret Elsa (née Wittke) McEathron, Nixon was a child film actress who also played the violin and began singing at an early age in choruses, including performing solos with the Roger Wagner Chorale. She went on to study singing and opera with, among others, Vera Schwarz, Carl Ebert, Boris Goldovsky and Sarah Caldwell. In 1947, having adopted the stage name &quot;Marni Nixon&quot;, she made her Hollywood Bowl solo debut in &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Leopold Stokowski.

==Career==

===Early films and musicals===
Nixon&#x27;s career in film started in 1948 when she sang the voices of the angels heard by Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948). The same year, she did her first dubbing work when she provided Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s singing voice in 1948&#x27;s &quot;Big City&quot; and then 1949&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. She sang for Jeanne Crain in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (1950) and dubbed Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s high notes in &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953). Also in 1953, she sang for Ida Lupino in &quot;Jennifer&quot;. Nixon appeared on Broadway in 1954 in &quot;The Girl in Pink Tights&quot;. 
In 1956, she worked closely with Deborah Kerr to supply the star&#x27;s singing voice for the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot;; Kerr broke with Hollywood convention by publicly crediting Nixon&#x27;s singing. In 1957 Nixon again worked with Kerr to dub her voice in &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;. That year, she also sang for Sophia Loren in &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot;. In 1960, she dubbed Janet Leigh&#x27;s voice in &quot;Pepe&quot; and had an on-screen chorus role in &quot;Can-Can&quot;. In 1961&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot;, the studio kept her work on the film (as the singing voice of Natalie Wood&#x27;s Maria) a secret from Wood, and Nixon also dubbed Rita Moreno&#x27;s singing in the film&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; quintet. She asked the film&#x27;s producers for, but did not receive, direct royalties from her work on the film, but Leonard Bernstein contractually gave her ¼ of one percent (0.25%) of his personal royalties from it. After a court case, she received royalties from sales of the soundtrack album and spoke out for the rights of ghost singers. In 1962, she also sang Wood&#x27;s high notes in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. For &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 1964, she again worked with the female lead of the film, Audrey Hepburn, to perform the songs of Hepburn&#x27;s character Eliza. Because of her uncredited dubbing work in these films, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called her &quot;The Ghostess with the Mostest&quot;. Nevertheless, the public did not know Nixon&#x27;s face; she appeared on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; the same year, where two members of the panel were fooled.

Nixon made guest appearances with Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot;, including in 1960, singing &quot;Improvisation sur Mallarmé I&quot; from &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; by Pierre Boulez, and on April 9, 1961, in a program entitled &quot;Folk Music in the Concert Hall&quot;, singing three &quot;Songs of the Auvergne&quot; by Joseph Canteloube. Before &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was released in theatres in 1964, Nixon played Eliza in a revival of the musical at New York City Center. Nixon&#x27;s first onscreen appearance was as Sister Sophia in the 1965 film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. In the DVD commentary to the film, director Robert Wise comments that audiences were finally able to see the woman whose voice they knew so well. In 1967, she was the singing voice of Princess Serena in a live action and animated version of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; on NBC. Especially in the 1960s, but also earlier and later, Nixon made concert appearances, specializing in contemporary music as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic, and gave recitals at Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall and Town Hall in New York City.

===Later work===
Nixon taught at the California Institute of the Arts in Montecito from 1969 to 1971 and joined the faculty of the Music Academy of the West, Santa Barbara, in 1980, where she taught for many years. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she hosted a children&#x27;s television show in Seattle on KOMO-TV channel 4 called &quot;Boomerang&quot;, winning four Emmy Awards as best actress, and made numerous other television appearances on variety shows and as a guest star in prime time series. Nixon&#x27;s opera repertory included Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, both Blonde and Konstanze in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, the title role in &quot;La Périchole&quot; and Philine in &quot;Mignon&quot;. Her opera credits included performances at Los Angeles Opera, Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera and the Tanglewood Music Festival among others. In addition to giving recitals, she appeared as an oratorio and concert soloist with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra among others. In 1983, she was a soloist with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. 

Nixon also toured with Liberace and Victor Borge and later in her own cabaret shows. On stage, in 1984, she originated the role of Edna Off-Broadway in &quot;Taking My Turn&quot;, composed by Gary William Friedman, receiving a nomination for a Drama Desk Award. She also originated the role of Sadie McKibben in &quot;Opal&quot; (1992), and she had a 1997 film role as Aunt Alice in &quot;I Think I Do&quot;. Under her own name, beginning in the 1980s, Nixon recorded songs by Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and various classical composers. She was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best Classical Performance, Vocal Soloist, one for her Schönberg album and one for her Copland album.

In the 1998 Disney film &quot;Mulan&quot;, Nixon was the singing voice of &quot;Grandmother Fa&quot;. She then returned to the stage, touring the United States as Fraulein Schneider in &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1997–1998. She eventually sang on more than 50 soundtracks. In 1999, she originated the role of Mrs. Wilson in the premiere of &quot;Ballymore&quot;, an opera by Richard Wargo at Skylight Opera Theatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which was taped for PBS. In regional theatre and Off-Broadway, she played Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and appeared in productions of &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. She also continued to teach voice and judge vocal competitions.

In 2000, after nearly a half century away, she returned to Broadway as Aunt Kate in &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s The Dead&quot;. In 2001, Nixon replaced Joan Roberts as Heidi Schiller in the Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. She played Eunice Miller in &quot;70, Girls, 70&quot; in a 2002 production in Los Angeles. In 2003, she was again on Broadway as a replacement in role of Guido&#x27;s mother in the revival of &quot;Nine&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;I Could Have Sung All Night&quot;, was published in 2006. She performed in the 2008 North American Tour of Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s UK revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in the role of Mrs. Higgins. She then appeared as Frau Direktor Kirschner in the 2009 Encores! production of the musical &quot;Music in the Air&quot; at New York City Center.

<doc id="477975" wikidata="Q1368367" url="?curid=477975" title="Cultural identity">
<text>Cultural identity is a part of a person&#x27;s identity, or their self-conception and self-perception, and is related to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality, gender, or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing. Cultural identity is an unfixed process that is continually evolving within the discourses of social, cultural, and historical experiences. Some people undergo more cultural identity changes as opposed to others, those who change less often have a clear cultural identity. This means that they have a dynamic yet stable integration of their culture.

There are three pieces that make up a person&#x27;s cultural identity: cultural knowledge, category label, and social connections. Cultural knowledge refers to a person&#x27;s connection to their identity through understanding their culture&#x27;s core characteristics. Category label refers to a person&#x27;s connection to their identity through indirect membership of said culture. Social connections refers to a person&#x27;s connection to their identity through their social relationships. Cultural identity is developed through a series of steps. First, a person comes to understand a culture through being immersed in those values, beliefs, and practices. Second, the person then identifies as a member of that culture dependent on their rank within that community. Third, they develop relationships such as immediate family, close friends, coworkers, and neighbors.

Culture is a term that is highly complex and often contested with academics recording about 160 variations in meaning. Underpinning the notion of culture is that it is dynamic and changes over time and in different contexts resulting in many people today identifying with one or more cultures and many different ways.

It is a defining feature of a person&#x27;s identity, contributing to how they see themselves and the groups with which they identify. A person&#x27;s understanding of their own and other&#x27;s identities develops from birth and is shaped by the values and attitudes prevalent at home and in the surrounding community.

==Description==

Various modern cultural studies and social theories have investigated cultural identity and understanding. In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged that breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: location, sex, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and food. As one author writes:

When talking about identity, we generally define this word as the series of physical features that differentiate a person. Thus at birth, our parents declare us and give us a name with which they will identify us based on whether we are a boy or a girl. Identity is not only a right that declares the name, sex, time, and place that one is born; the word identity goes beyond what we define it. Identity is a function of elements that portrays one in a dynamic way, in constant evolution, throughout the stages of life identity develops based on personal experiences, tastes, and choices of a sexual and religious nature, as well as the social environment, these being some of the main parameters that influence and transform the day to day and allow us to discover a new part of ourselves.

The divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.

As a &quot;historical reservoir,&quot; culture is an important factor in shaping identity. Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its &quot;historical reservoir,&quot; many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change.
Some critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society and that cosmopolitanism gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship. When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their &#x27;make up&#x27; that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other. Nations provide the framework for cultural identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.

There is a relationship between cultural identity and new media.

Rather than necessarily representing an individual&#x27;s interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media. Accordingly, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.

A range of cultural complexities structures the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. Nation is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for an individual&#x27;s identity, but it may contrast with one&#x27;s cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones religion, ancestry, skin color, language, class, education, profession, skill, family and political attitudes. These factors contribute to the development of one&#x27;s identity.

==History==
The history of cultural identity develops out of the observations of a number of social scientists. A history of cultural identity is important because it outlines the understanding of how our identities provide a way to see ourselves in relation to the world in which we live. &quot;Cultural identities...are the natural, and most fundamental, constitutive elements of individual and collective identity.&quot;

Franz Boas is an important figure in the creation of the idea of cultural identity. Boas is known for challenging ideas about culture. Boas promoted the importance of viewing a culture from within its own perspective and understanding, not from the outsider&#x27;s view point. This was a somewhat radical perspective at the time. Additionally, Myron Lustig is credited with contributing the concept of cultural identity theory.

A number of contemporary theorists continue to contribute to the concept of cultural identity. For instance, contemporary work completed by Stuart Hall is considered essential to understand cultural identity. According to Hall, identity is defined by at least two specific actions, which are similarity and difference. Specifically, in settings of slavery and colonization, identity provides a connection to the past as well as disintegration from a shared origination.

Theorists&#x27; questions about identity include &quot;whether identity is to be understood as something internal that persists through change or as something ascribed from without that changes according to circumstance.&quot; Whatever the case may be, Gleason advocates for &quot;sensitivity to the intrinsic complexities of the subject matter with which it deals, and careful attention to the need for precision and consistency in its application. Cultural identity can also become a marker of difference that requires sensitivity.

Kuper presents concepts on cultural identity within the framework of a power dynamic. He writes, &quot;The privileged lie and mislead, but the oppressed come gradually to appreciate their objective circumstances and formulate a new consciousness that will ultimately liberate them.&quot; The consciousness is a facet of their identity. Similarly, identity plays a role in mediating between a human being and the environment in which they exist.

The identity of a person is &quot;a result of socialization and customs&quot; that promotes the maintenance of distinct cultural identities from generation to generation. Additionally, identity can be considered that which forms cultures and results in &quot;dictated appropriate behavior.&quot; Put another way, identity may dictate behavior that results in the reification of identity with the individual as a &quot;replicate in miniature of the larger social and cultural entity. Another way to consider cultural identity is that it is &quot;the sum of material wealth and spiritual wealth created by human beings in the practice of social history.&quot;

Globalization is connected to influences in economics, politics, and society. Accordingly, globalization has an impact on cultural identity. As societies become even more connected, there are concerns that cultural identities will become homogenized through the increased level of connection and communication. However, there are alternative perspectives on this issue. For instance, Wright theorizes that &quot;The spread of global culture and globalised ideas has led to many movements designed to embrace the uniqueness and diversity of an individual&#x27;s particular culture.&quot;

==Cultural arena==
It is also noted that an individual&#x27;s &quot;cultural arena,&quot; or place where one lives, impacts the culture that person abides by. The surroundings, environment, and people in these places play a role in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to fit into the culture of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant&#x27;s current belief in their culture and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.

Some might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by committing to two or more cultures. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus, cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The impact of the cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real-world cultural arena. This adaptability is what allows people to feel a part of society and culture wherever they go.

==Language==
Language allows for people in a group to communicate their values, beliefs, and customs, all of which contribute to creating a cultural identity. It was for a long time believed that if children lose their languages, they lose part or all of their cultural identity. When students who are non-native English speakers, go to classes where they are required to speak only English, they feel that their native language has no value. Some studies found, that this leads to loss of their culture and language altogether and this can lead to either a massive change in cultural identity, or they find themselves struggling to understand who they are. Language also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language. The learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a second language. Since many aspects of a person&#x27;s cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures, language is a major component of cultural identity. However, more recent research could show, that language may be not a crucial part of a person&#x27;s identity or cultural identity.

==Education==
Cultural identity is often not discussed in the classroom or learning environment where an instructor presides over the class. This often happens when the instructor attempts to discuss cultural identity and the issues that come with it in the classroom and is met with disagreement and cannot make forward progress in the conversation. Moreover, not talking about cultural identity can lead to issues such as prohibiting growth of education, development of a sense of self, and social competency. In these environments there are often many different cultures and problems can occur due to different worldviews that prevent others from being able to think outwardly about their peers&#x27; values and differing backgrounds. If students are able to think outwardly, then they can not only better connect with their peers, but also further develop their own worldview. In addition to this, instructors should take into account the needs of different students&#x27; backgrounds in order to best relay the material in a way that engages the student.

When students learn that knowledge and truth are relevant to each person, that instructors do not know everything, and that their own personal experiences dictate what they believe they can better contextualize new information using their own experiences as well as taking into account the different cultural experiences of others. This in turn increases the ability to critically think and challenge new information which benefits all students learning in a classroom setting. There are two ways instructors can better elicit this response from their students through active communication of cultural identity. The first is by having students engage in class discussion with their peers. Doing so creates community and allows for students to share their knowledge as well as question their peers and instructors, thereby, learning about each other&#x27;s cultural identity and creating acceptance of differing worldviews in the classroom. The second way is by using active learning methods such as &quot;forming small groups and analyzing case studies&quot;. Through engaging in active learning students learn that their cultural identity is welcomed and accepted.

== Cultural identity and immigrant experience ==
Identity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of acculturation. Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when groups or individuals from different cultures come into continuous contact with one another and adopt certain values and practices that were not originally their own. Acculturation is unique from assimilation. Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a qualitative study through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity. The results indicated that &quot;acculturation appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing. However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country&quot; (Birman &amp; Trickett, 2001).

In a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, the combination of a strong ethnic and a strong national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence. An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural. It showed that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one&#x27;s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990). Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, language classes, after-school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures. It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants&#x27; identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada, has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths. In the study cited, a combination of family workshops and teacher professional development aimed to improve the language learning and emotional development of these youths and families.

==School Transitions==
How great is &quot;Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School&quot;? John W. Alspaugh&#x27;s research is in the September/October 1998 &quot;Journal of Educational Research&quot; (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.

The Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.

Unexamined cultural identity: &quot;a stage where one&#x27;s cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues.&quot; This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn&#x27;t distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually, a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.

An example of thought in this stage: &quot;I don&#x27;t have a culture I&#x27;m just an American.&quot; &quot;My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I&#x27;ve never lived there.&quot;

Cultural identity search: &quot;is the process of exploration and questioning about one&#x27;s culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture.&quot; During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.

An example of thought in this stage: &quot;I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others.&quot; &quot;There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am.&quot;

Cultural identity achievement: &quot;is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one&#x27;s cultural identity.&quot; In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment
There is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between virtual culture – understood as the modes and norms of behavior associated with the internet and the online world – and youth culture. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and real sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.

In the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a Moebius strip where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of active learning, of googling &#x27;when you don&#x27;t know&#x27;, of recourse to tutorials for learning a program or a game, or the expression &#x27;I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing&#x27; are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.

The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others&#x27; reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today&#x27;s youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependent on peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, image or video they upload, they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the &#x27;real&#x27; world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of identity construction.

Youth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the &#x27;real&#x27; world.

From other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of &#x27;identity laboratory&#x27; and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity. On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. video games or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.

<doc id="477981" wikidata="Q2746524" url="?curid=477981" title="Password cracking">
<text>In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of guessing passwords protecting a computer system. A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password. Another type of approach is password spraying, which is often automated and occurs slowly over time in order to remain undetected, using a list of common passwords.

The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (due to the fact that installing an entirely new password would involve System Administration privileges), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or to act as a preventive measure whereby system administrators check for easily crackable passwords. On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence to which a judge has allowed access, when a particular file&#x27;s permissions restricted.

==Time needed for password searches==
The time to crack a password is related to bit strength, which is a measure of the password&#x27;s entropy, and the details of how the password is stored. Most methods of password cracking require the computer to produce many candidate passwords, each of which is checked. One example is brute-force cracking, in which a computer tries &quot;every&quot; possible key or password until it succeeds. With multiple processors, this time can be optimized through searching from the last possible group of symbols and the beginning at the same time, with other processors being placed to search through a designated selection of possible passwords. More common methods of password cracking, such as dictionary attacks, pattern checking, and variations of common words, aim to optimize the number of guesses and are usually attempted before brute-force attacks. Higher password bit strength exponentially increases the number of candidate passwords that must be checked, on average, to recover the password and reduces the likelihood that the password will be found in any cracking dictionary.

The ability to crack passwords using computer programs is also a function of the number of possible passwords per second which can be checked. If a hash of the target password is available to the attacker, this number can be in the billions or trillions per second, since an &quot;offline attack&quot; is possible. If not, the rate depends on whether the authentication software limits how often a password can be tried, either by time delays, CAPTCHAs, or forced lockouts after some number of failed attempts. Another situation where quick guessing is possible is when the password is used to form a cryptographic key. In such cases, an attacker can quickly check to see if a guessed password successfully decodes encrypted data.

For some kinds of password hash, ordinary desktop computers can test over a hundred million passwords per second using password cracking tools running on a general purpose CPU and billions of passwords per second using GPU-based password cracking tools . The rate of password guessing depends heavily on the cryptographic function used by the system to generate password hashes. A suitable password hashing function, such as bcrypt, is many orders of magnitude better than a naive function like simple MD5 or SHA. A user-selected eight-character password with numbers, mixed case, and symbols, with commonly selected passwords and other dictionary matches filtered out, reaches an estimated 30-bit strength, according to NIST. 230 is only one billion permutations and would be cracked in seconds if the hashing function were naive. When ordinary desktop computers are combined in a cracking effort, as can be done with botnets, the capabilities of password cracking are considerably extended. In 2002, distributed.net successfully found a 64-bit RC5 key in four years, in an effort which included over 300,000 different computers at various times, and which generated an average of over 12 billion keys per second.

Graphics processing units can speed up password cracking by a factor of 50 to 100 over general purpose computers for specific hashing algorithms. As an example, in 2011, available commercial products claimed the ability to test up to 2,800,000,000 NTLM passwords a second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor. Such a device can crack a 10-letter single-case password in one day. The work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs. However some algorithms run slowly, or even are specifically designed to run slowly, on GPUs. Examples are DES, Triple DES, bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2.

Hardware acceleration in a GPU has enabled resources to be used to increase the efficiency and speed of a brute force attack for most hashing algorithms. In 2012, Stricture Consulting Group unveiled a 25-GPU cluster that achieved a brute force attack speed of 350 billion guesses of NTLM passwords per second, allowing them to check formula_1password combinations in 5.5 hours, enough to crack all 8-character alpha-numeric-special-character passwords commonly used in enterprise settings. Using ocl-Hashcat Plus on a Virtual OpenCL cluster platform, the Linux-based GPU cluster was used to &quot;crack 90 percent of the 6.5 million password hashes belonging to users of LinkedIn&quot;.

For some specific hashing algorithms, CPUs and GPUs are not a good match. Purpose-made hardware is required to run at high speeds. Custom hardware can be made using FPGA or ASIC technology. Development for both technologies is complex and (very) expensive. In general, FPGAs are favorable in small quantities, ASICs are favorable in (very) large quantities, more energy efficient, and faster. In 1998, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) built a dedicated password cracker using ASICs. Their machine, Deep Crack, broke a DES 56-bit key in 56 hours, testing over 90 billion keys per second. In 2017, leaked documents showed that ASICs were used for a military project that had a potential to code-break many parts of the Internet communications with weaker encryption. Since 2019, John the Ripper supports password cracking for a limited number of hashing algorithms using FPGAs. Commercial companies are now using FPGA-based setups for password cracking.

==Easy to remember, hard to guess==
Passwords that are difficult to remember will reduce the security of a system because:
*users might need to write down or electronically store the password using an insecure method,
*users will need frequent password resets, and
*users are more likely to re-use the same password.

Similarly, the more stringent the requirements for password strength, e.g. &quot;have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits&quot; or &quot;change it monthly&quot;, the greater the degree to which users will subvert the system.

In &quot;The Memorability and Security of Passwords&quot;, Jeff Yan &quot;et al.&quot; examine the effect of advice given to users about a good choice of password. They found that passwords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each word are just as memorable as naively selected passwords, and just as hard to crack as randomly generated passwords. Combining two unrelated words is another good method. Having a personally designed &quot;algorithm&quot; for generating obscure passwords is another good method.

However, asking users to remember a password consisting of a &quot;mix of uppercase and lowercase characters&quot; is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and only a little bit harder to crack (e.g. only 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passwords, less if the user simply capitalizes one of the letters). Asking users to use &quot;both letters and digits&quot; will often lead to easy-to-guess substitutions such as &#x27;E&#x27; → &#x27;3&#x27; and &#x27;I&#x27; → &#x27;1&#x27;: substitutions which are well known to attackers. Similarly, typing the password one keyboard row higher is a common trick known to attackers.

Research detailed in an April 2015 paper by several professors at Carnegie Mellon University shows that people&#x27;s choices of password structure often follow several known patterns. For example, when password requirements require a long minimum length such as 16 characters, people tend to repeat characters or even entire words within their passwords. As a result, passwords may be much more easily cracked than their mathematical probabilities would otherwise indicate. Passwords containing one digit, for example, disproportionately include it at the end of the password.

==Incidents==
On July 16, 1998, CERT reported an incident where an attacker had found 186,126 encrypted passwords. By the time the breach was discovered, 47,642 passwords had already been cracked.

In December 2009, a major password breach of Rockyou.com occurred that led to the release of 32 million passwords. The attacker then leaked the full list of the 32 million passwords (with no other identifiable information) to the internet. Passwords were stored in cleartext in the database and were extracted through an SQL injection vulnerability. The Imperva Application Defense Center (ADC) did an analysis on the strength of the passwords. Some of the key findings were:

*about 30% of users chose passwords whose length was below seven characters,
*almost 60% of users chose their passwords from a limited set of alpha-numeric characters, and
*nearly 50% of users used names, slang words, dictionary words, or trivial passwords that employed weak constructs such as consecutive digits and/or adjacent keyboard case in point, the most common password among RockYou account owners was simply “123456”.

In June 2011, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) suffered a security breach that led to the public release of first and last names, usernames, and passwords of more than 11,000 registered users of their e-bookshop. The data were leaked as part of Operation AntiSec, a movement that includes Anonymous, LulzSec, and other hacking groups and individuals.

On July 11, 2011, Booz Allen Hamilton, a large American consulting firm that does a substantial amount of work for the Pentagon, had its servers hacked by Anonymous and leaked the same day. &quot;The leak, dubbed &#x27;Military Meltdown Monday&#x27;, includes 90,000 logins of military personnel—including personnel from USCENTCOM, SOCOM, the Marine Corps, various Air Force facilities, Homeland Security, State Department staff, and what looks like private-sector contractors.&quot; These leaked passwords were found to be hashed with unsalted SHA-1, and were later analyzed by the ADC team at Imperva, revealing that even some military personnel used passwords as weak as &quot;1234&quot;.

On July 18, 2011, Microsoft Hotmail banned the password: &quot;123456&quot;.

In July 2015, a group calling itself &quot;The Impact Team&quot; stole the user data of Ashley Madison. Many passwords were hashed using both the relatively strong bcrypt algorithm and the weaker MD5 hash. Attacking the latter algorithm allowed some 11 million plaintext passwords to be recovered by password cracking group CynoSure Prime.

==Prevention==
One method of preventing a password from being cracked is to ensure that attackers cannot get access even to the hashed password. For example, on the Unix operating system, hashed passwords were originally stored in a publicly accessible file codice_1. On modern Unix (and similar) systems, on the other hand, they are stored in the shadow password file codice_2, which is accessible only to programs running with enhanced privileges (i.e., &quot;system&quot; privileges). This makes it harder for a malicious user to obtain the hashed passwords in the first instance, however many collections of password hashes have been stolen despite such protection. And some common network protocols transmit passwords in cleartext or use weak challenge/response schemes.

The use of salt, a random value unique to each password that is incorporated in the hashing, prevents multiple hashes from being attacked simultaneously and also prevents the creation of pre-computed dictionaries such as rainbow tables.

Another approach is to combine a site-specific secret key with the password hash, which prevents plaintext password recovery even if the hashed values are purloined. However privilege escalation attacks that can steal protected hash files may also expose the site secret. A third approach is to use key derivation functions that reduce the rate at which passwords can be guessed.

Modern Unix Systems have replaced the traditional DES-based password hashing function crypt() with stronger methods such as crypt-SHA, bcrypt, and scrypt. Other systems have also begun to adopt these methods. For instance, the Cisco IOS originally used a reversible Vigenère cipher to encrypt passwords, but now uses md5-crypt with a 24-bit salt when the &quot;enable secret&quot; command is used. These newer methods use large salt values which prevent attackers from efficiently mounting offline attacks against multiple user accounts simultaneously. The algorithms are also much slower to execute which drastically increases the time required to mount a successful offline attack.

Many hashes used for storing passwords, such as MD5 and the SHA family, are designed for fast computation with low memory requirements and efficient implementation in hardware. Multiple instances of these algorithms can be run in parallel on graphics processing units (GPUs), speeding cracking. As a result, fast hashes are ineffective in preventing password cracking, even with salt. Some key stretching algorithms, such as PBKDF2 and crypt-SHA iteratively calculate password hashes and can significantly reduce the rate at which passwords can be tested, if the iteration count is high enough. Other algorithms, such as scrypt are memory-hard, meaning they require relatively large amounts of memory in addition to time-consuming computation and are thus more difficult to crack using GPUs and custom integrated circuits.

In 2013 a long-term Password Hashing Competition was announced to choose a new, standard algorithm for password hashing, with Argon2 chosen as the winner in 2015. Another algorithm, Balloon, is recommended by NIST. Both algorithms are memory-hard.

Solutions like a security token give a by constantly shifting password. Those solutions abruptly reduce the timeframe available for brute forcing (the attacker needs to break and use the password within a single shift) and they reduce the value of the stolen passwords because of its short time validity.

==Software==
There are many password cracking software tools, but the most popular are Aircrack-ng, Cain &amp; Abel, John the Ripper, Hashcat, Hydra, DaveGrohl, and ElcomSoft. Many litigation support software packages also include password cracking functionality. Most of these packages employ a mixture of cracking strategies; algorithms with brute-force and dictionary attacks proving to be the most productive.

The increased availability of computing power and beginner friendly automated password cracking software for a number of protection schemes has allowed the activity to be taken up by script kiddies.

<text>In bioinformatics, sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as DNA sequencing technology might not be able to &#x27;read&#x27; whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30,000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).

The problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable.

== Types ==

There are three approaches to assembling sequencing data:

# De-novo: assembling sequencing reads to create full-length (sometimes novel) sequences, without using a template (see de novo sequence assemblers, de novo transcriptome assembly)
# Mapping/Aligning: assembling reads by aligning reads against a template (AKA reference). The assembled consensus may not be identical to the template. 
# Reference-guided: grouping of reads by similarity to the most similar region within the reference (step wise mapping). Reads within each group are then shortened down to mimic short reads quality. A typical method to do so is the k-mer approach. Reference-guided assembly is most useful using long-reads.

Referenced-guided assembly is a combination of the other types. This type is applied on long reads to mimic short reads advantages (i.e. call quality). The logic behind it is to group the reads by smaller windows within the reference. Reads in each group will then be reduced in size using the k-mere approach to select the highest quality and most probable contiguous (contig). Contigs will then will be joined together to create a scaffold. The final consense is made by closing any gaps in the scaffold. 

== Assemblies ==

=== Genome ===

The first sequence assemblers began to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s as variants of simpler sequence alignment programs to piece together vast quantities of fragments generated by automated sequencing instruments called DNA sequencers. As the sequenced organisms grew in size and complexity (from small viruses over plasmids to bacteria and finally eukaryotes), the assembly programs used in these genome projects needed increasingly sophisticated strategies to handle:

* terabytes of sequencing data which need processing on computing clusters;
* identical and nearly identical sequences (known as &quot;repeats&quot;) which can, in the worst case, increase the time and space complexity of algorithms quadratically;
* DNA read errors in the fragments from the sequencing instruments, which can confound assembly.

Faced with the challenge of assembling the first larger eukaryotic genomes—the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; in 2000 and the human genome just a year later,—scientists developed assemblers like Celera Assembler and Arachne able to handle genomes of 130 million (e.g., the fruit fly &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;) to 3 billion (e.g., the human genome) base pairs. Subsequent to these efforts, several other groups, mostly at the major genome sequencing centers, built large-scale assemblers, and an open source effort known as AMOS was launched to bring together all the innovations in genome assembly technology under the open source framework.

=== EST ===

Expressed sequence tag or EST assembly was an early strategy, dating from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, to assemble individual genes rather than whole genomes. The problem differs from genome assembly in several ways. The input sequences for EST assembly are fragments of the transcribed mRNA of a cell and represent only a subset of the whole genome. A number of algorithmical problems differ between genome and EST assembly. For instance, genomes often have large amounts of repetitive sequences, concentrated in the intergenic regions. Transcribed genes contain many fewer repeats, making assembly somewhat easier. On the other hand, some genes are expressed (transcribed) in very high numbers (e.g., housekeeping genes), which means that unlike whole-genome shotgun sequencing, the reads are not uniformly sampled across the genome.

EST assembly is made much more complicated by features like (cis-) alternative splicing, trans-splicing, single-nucleotide polymorphism, and post-transcriptional modification. Beginning in 2008 when RNA-Seq was invented, EST sequencing was replaced by this far more efficient technology, described under de novo transcriptome assembly.

=== De-novo vs mapping assembly ===

In terms of complexity and time requirements, de-novo assemblies are orders of magnitude slower and more memory intensive than mapping assemblies. This is mostly due to the fact that the assembly algorithm needs to compare every read with every other read (an operation that has a naive time complexity of O(n2)). Current de-novo genome assemblers may use different types of graph-based algorithms, such as the:

* &quot;Overlap/Layout/Consensus&quot; (OLC) approach, which was typical of the Sanger-data assemblers and relies on an overlap graph;
* &quot;de Bruijn Graph&quot; (DBG) approach, which is most widely applied to the short reads from the Solexa and SOLiD platforms. It relies on K-mer graphs, which performs well with vast quantities of short reads;
* &quot;Greedy graph-based&quot; approach, which may also use one of the OLC or DBG approaches. With greedy graph-based algorithms, the contigs, series of reads aligned together, grow by greedy extension, always taking on the read that is found by following the highest-scoring overlap.

Referring to the comparison drawn to shredded books in the introduction: while for mapping assemblies one would have a very similar book as a template (perhaps with the names of the main characters and a few locations changed), de-novo assemblies present a more daunting challenge in that one would not know beforehand whether this would become a science book, a novel, a catalogue, or even several books. Also, every shred would be compared with every other shred.

Handling repeats in de-novo assembly requires the construction of a graph representing neighboring repeats. Such information can be derived from reading a long fragment covering the repeats in full or only its two ends. On the other hand, in a mapping assembly, parts with multiple or no matches are usually left for another assembling technique to look into.

== Technological advances ==

The complexity of sequence assembly is driven by two major factors: the number of fragments and their lengths. While more and longer fragments allow better identification of sequence overlaps, they also pose problems as the underlying algorithms show quadratic or even exponential complexity behaviour to both number of fragments and their length. And while shorter sequences are faster to align, they also complicate the layout phase of an assembly as shorter reads are more difficult to use with repeats or near identical repeats.

In the earliest days of DNA sequencing, scientists could only gain a few sequences of short length (some dozen bases) after weeks of work in laboratories. Hence, these sequences could be aligned in a few minutes by hand.

In 1975, the &quot;dideoxy termination&quot; method (AKA &quot;Sanger sequencing&quot;) was invented and until shortly after 2000, the technology was improved up to a point where fully automated machines could churn out sequences in a highly parallelised mode 24 hours a day. Large genome centers around the world housed complete farms of these sequencing machines, which in turn led to the necessity of assemblers to be optimised for sequences from whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects where the reads

* are about 800–900 bases long
* contain sequencing artifacts like sequencing and cloning vectors
* have error rates between 0.5 and 10%

With the Sanger technology, bacterial projects with 20,000 to 200,000 reads could easily be assembled on one computer. Larger projects, like the human genome with approximately 35 million reads, needed large computing farms and distributed computing.

By 2004 / 2005, pyrosequencing had been brought to commercial viability by 454 Life Sciences. This new sequencing method generated reads much shorter than those of Sanger sequencing: initially about 100 bases, now 400-500 bases. Its much higher throughput and lower cost (compared to Sanger sequencing) pushed the adoption of this technology by genome centers, which in turn pushed development of sequence assemblers that could efficiently handle the read sets. The sheer amount of data coupled with technology-specific error patterns in the reads delayed development of assemblers; at the beginning in 2004 only the Newbler assembler from 454 was available. Released in mid-2007, the hybrid version of the MIRA assembler by Chevreux et al. was the first freely available assembler that could assemble 454 reads as well as mixtures of 454 reads and Sanger reads. Assembling sequences from different sequencing technologies was subsequently coined &quot;hybrid assembly&quot;.

From 2006, the Illumina (previously Solexa) technology has been available and can generate about 100 million reads per run on a single sequencing machine. Compare this to the 35 million reads of the human genome project which needed several years to be produced on hundreds of sequencing machines. Illumina was initially limited to a length of only 36 bases, making it less suitable for de novo assembly (such as de novo transcriptome assembly), but newer iterations of the technology achieve read lengths above 100 bases from both ends of a 3-400bp clone. Announced at the end of 2007, the SHARCGS assembler by Dohm et al. was the first published assembler that was used for an assembly with Solexa reads. It was quickly followed by a number of others.

Later, new technologies like SOLiD from Applied Biosystems, Ion Torrent and SMRT were released and new technologies (e.g. Nanopore sequencing) continue to emerge. Despite the higher error rates of these technologies they are important for assembly because their longer read length helps to address the repeat problem. It is impossible to assemble through a perfect repeat that is longer than the maximum read length; however, as reads become longer the chance of a perfect repeat that large becomes small. This gives longer sequencing reads an advantage in assembling repeats even if they have low accuracy (≈85%).

== Quality control ==
Most sequence assemblers have some algorithms built in for quality control, such as Phred. However, such measures do not assess assembly completeness in terms of gene content. Some tools evaluate the quality of an assembly after the fact.

For instance, BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) is a measure of gene completeness in a genome, gene set, or transcriptome, using the fact that many genes are present only as single-copy genes in most genomes. The initial BUSCO sets represented 3023 genes for vertebrates, 2675 for arthropods, 843 for metazoans, 1438 for fungi and 429 for eukaryotes. This table shows an example for human and fruit fly genomes:
== Assembly algorithms ==

Different organisms have a distinct region of higher complexity within their genome. Hence, the need of different computational approaches is needed. Some of the commonly used algorithms are:

; Graph Assembly: is based on Graph theory in computer science. The de Bruijn Graph is an example of this approach and utilizes k-mers to assemble a contiguous from reads.
; Greedy Graph Assembly: this approach score each added read to the assembly and selects the highest possible score from the overlapping region. 
:Given a set of sequence fragments, the object is to find a longer sequence that contains all the fragments (see figure under &quot;Types of Sequence Assembly&quot;):
:# Сalculate pairwise alignments of all fragments.
:# Choose two fragments with the largest overlap.
:# Merge chosen fragments.
:# Repeat step 2 and 3 until only one fragment is left.
:The result might not be an optimal solution to the problem.

== Bioinformatics pipeline ==
In general, there are three steps in assembling sequencing reads into a scaffold:
# Pre-assembly: This step is essential to ensure the integrity of downstream analysis such as variant calling or final scaffold sequence. This step consists of two chronological workflows: 
## Quality check: Depending on the type of sequencing technology, different errors might arise that would lead to a false base call. For example, sequencing &quot;NAAAAAAAAAAAAN&quot; and &quot;NAAAAAAAAAAAN&quot; which include 12 adenine might be wrongfully called with 11 adenine instead. Sequencing a highly repetitive segment of the target DNA/RNA might result in a call that is one base shorter or one base longer. Read quality is typically measured by Phred which is an encoded score of each nucleotide quality within a read&#x27;s sequence. Some sequencing technologies such as PacBio do not have a scoring method for their sequenced reads. A common tool used in this step is FastQC.
## Filtering of reads: Reads that failed to pass the quality check should be removed from the FASTQ file to get the best assembly contigs.
# Assembly: During this step, reads alignment will be utilized with different criteria to map each read to the possible location. The predicted position of a read is based on either how much of its sequence aligns with other reads or a reference. Different alignment algorithms are used for reads from different sequencing technologies. Some of the commonly used approaches in the assembly are de Bruijn graph and overlapping. Read length, coverage, quality, and the sequencing technique used plays a major role in choosing the best alignment algorithm in the case of Next Generation Sequencing. On the other hand, algorithms aligning 3rd generation sequencing reads requires advance approaches to account for the high error rate associated with them. 
# Post-assembly: This step is focusing on extracting valuable information from the assembled sequence. Comparative genomics and population analysis are examples of post-assembly analysis.

<text>Whipsnade Zoo, formerly known as ZSL Whipsnade Zoo and Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, is a zoo and safari park located at Whipsnade, near Dunstable in Bedfordshire, England. It is one of two zoos (the other being London Zoo in Regent&#x27;s Park, London) that are owned by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), a charity devoted to the worldwide conservation of animals and their habitats.

==Description==

The park covers , and can be located from miles to the north and from the air because of the Whipsnade White Lion, a large hill figure carved into the side of the Dunstable Downs (part of the Chiltern Hills) below the white rhino enclosure.

Due to its size, inside the park, visitors may walk or drive their own cars between the various animal enclosures, or through an &#x27;Asian&#x27; area where some animals are allowed to roam free around the cars. There is also a train service, the narrow-gauge Great Whipsnade Railway, also known as the &quot;Jumbo Express.&quot;

Whipsnade Zoo is the UK&#x27;s largest zoo and one of Europe&#x27;s largest wildlife conservation parks. It is home to 3,626 animals, many of which are endangered in the wild. The majority of the animals are kept within sizeable enclosures; others, such as peafowl, Patagonian maras, and red-necked wallabies, roam freely around the park.

==History==
===Early years===
The Zoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles with the aim of promoting the worldwide conservation of animals and their habitats. To this end London Zoo in Regents Park, London was established.

Almost 100 years later, Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell (ZSL Secretary 1903–1935) was inspired by a visit to the Bronx Zoological Park to create a park in Britain as a conservation centre.

Hall Farm, a derelict farm on the Dunstable Downs, to the north of London was purchased by the Zoological Society of London in 1926 for £13,480 12s 10d. The site was fenced, roads built and trees planted.

The first animals arrived at the park in 1928, including two Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasants, a golden pheasant, and five red junglefowl. Others soon followed including muntjac, llama, wombats and skunks.

Whipsnade Park Zoo opened on Sunday 23 May 1931. It was the first open zoo in Europe to be easily accessible to the visiting public. It was an immediate success and received over 38,000 visitors on the following Monday. The brown bear enclosure is a surviving feature from the earliest days of the zoo.

The collection of animals was boosted in 1932 by the purchase of a collection from a defunct travelling menagerie and some of the larger animals walked to the zoo from Dunstable station.

The distinctive white lion hill figure was completed in 1933 and refreshed in 2018.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, the zoo acted as a refuge for animals evacuated from the Regents Park London Zoo. The celebrity giant pandas Ming, Sung and Tang were among these animals but were soon returned to London to boost morale in the capital. During 1940, 41 bombs fell on the park with little damage to the zoo structure; some of the ponds in the park are the remains of bomb craters from this period. A spur-winged goose and a 3-year-old giraffe named Boxer, which had been born at the zoo, died as a result of the bombings; the giraffe ran herself to exhaustion in fright at the explosions.

===Recent developments===
In 1996, a new elephant house and paddock was opened to replace the architecturally outstanding but cramped original elephant house designed by Lubetkin and Tecton in 1935. The old house remains at the zoo as a Grade II* listed building and its associated enclosure contains the zoo&#x27;s lemurs.

In the early 2000s the zoo added new exhibits including Lions of the Serengeti in 2005, a walk-through lemur enclosure in 2007 (officially opened on 28 March 2007 by Dominic Byrne from &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; on Radio 1, who is a regular visitor to the park), the Rhinos of Nepal exhibit in February 2007, Cheetah Rock on Easter 2008, a sloth bear exhibit in May 2008, and Wild Wild Whipsnade in May 2009. In July 2008, the Café on the Lake was reopened after remodelling, with its name changed to the Wild Bite Café.

In May 2009, William Windsor (known as Billy), a goat mascot of the British Army&#x27;s Royal Welsh regiment, retired to the zoo after eight years&#x27; distinguished service performing ceremonial duties.

In April 2024, the new Monkey Forest habitat was opened. A 2km walk where you have a different perspective of the passage through Asia on one side, and two new mixed-species enclosures on the other, housing langurs, macaques, babirusa, and anoa. 

==Exhibits==
===Butterfly House===
The Butterfly House opened in 2016, the house is home to various species of butterfly and dwarf crocodiles, it is a walkthrough exhibit so the Butterflies are flying around when people go through the exhibit. This house is also home to one of the largest moths in the world; the atlas moth.

===Passage Through Asia===
Passage Through Asia is a large paddock with no boundaries between visitors and the animals. Visitors can only access the area by driving through it in their own cars or riding on the Jumbo Express train. The paddock houses herds of Bactrian camels, barasingha, fallow deer, sika deer, Père David&#x27;s deer and yaks.

===Lions of the Serengeti ===
Opened in 2005, Lions of the Serengeti was home to a pride of 7 African lions. The pride of African lions included two adult females named Mashaka-Lia and Kachanga, three younger males named Neo, Toto and Max, and a younger female named Kia. The four younger lions are the offspring of Spike, the zoo&#x27;s former male lion and Mashaka-Lia, and were born in April 2006. In October 2021 Toto died at the age of 15 due to ill health. In December 2021 the remaining lions Neo, Kia and Max were euthanized after age related conditions were beginning to cause them pain and discomfort. The Lion habitat is now closed until a suitable breeding group can be sourced.

In early 2022, the zoo temporarily housed 5 lions named Zero, Tor, Jabu, Mo and Kaya from Africa Alive! Suffolk, after their enclosure suffered damage from Storm Eunice.

From May 2022, the zoo housed Khari, a male lion from the Blackpool Zoo. 
Khari will leave Whipsnade Zoo in 2023 Summer to return to Blackpool Zoo. Whipsnade will continue to search for an appropriate breeding group. Later, two new lionesses from Belgium and a male from Germany will join the zoo&#x27;s collection.

===Sea Lion Splash===

Formerly the zoo&#x27;s Dolphin Pool, Sea Lion Splash was a daily demonstration in which the zoo&#x27;s three trained California sea lions (two females named Bailey and Lara, and a male named Dom) perform tricks and stunts in their pool (referred to as the &#x27;Splash Zone&#x27;). In June 2015, Dom and Bailey gave birth to a male sea lion called Oscar. In February 2021, the zoo&#x27;s sea lions were transferred to Yorkshire Wildlife Park, in South Yorkshire.

===Elephant herd===

ZSL Whipsnade Zoo keeps a herd of seven Asian elephants, consisting of cows Kaylee, Lucha, Karishma, Donna, Elizabeth, Nang Phaya and bull elephant Ming Jung. The latter arrived from Antwerp in November 2019 as part of the European Endangered Species Programme.

Their paddock is seven acres, and features three pools, mud wallows and dust baths. One of the female elephants, named Karishma, and her pregnancy with her first calf George, featured heavily in the first series of the ITV documentary programme &quot;The Zoo&quot;, which follows the daily lives of the staff at both Whipsnade and London Zoo. Another female calf was born during Elizabeth II&#x27;s 90th birthday celebrations and was named in her honour. The elephant herd moved to a new indoor facility, the £2 million Centre for Elephant Care, which opened in April 2017.

===Rhinos of Nepal===

Opened in February 2008, Rhinos of Nepal houses a group of four Indian rhinoceros – Hugo, Beluki, Behan and a young male called Bali (born to Behan in September 2015). The building aims to be environmentally friendly, using rain water captured on the roof to fill the pools, heating the pools with solar energy and featuring barriers that are made from recycled wooden railway sleepers instead of metal bars.

===Birds of the World===
A daily educational show in which keepers present various bird species demonstrating their natural abilities to an audience of visitors.

===Cheetah Rock===

Opened in 2008, this exhibit is home to a group of cheetahs, and features displays that inform visitors about ZSL&#x27;s cheetah conservation project in Tanzania. Despite ZSL&#x27;s conservation project being focused on East Africa, the Cheetahs at Whipsnade are in fact Sudan cheetahs from Northeast Africa.
The zoo is now home to three male cheetahs who moved in 2022 from Ireland.

===Hullabazoo Farm===

An area aimed primarily at children and housing domesticated livestock such as turkeys, llamas, alpacas, cows, silkie chickens, horses and miniature ponies, donkeys, guinea pigs, and goats, most of which are free roaming. The Hullabazoo Farm is once also home to a female Bennett&#x27;s wallaby named Pip, who was abandoned by her mother and hand-reared by keepers.

===Wild Wild Whipsnade===
Wild Wild Whipsnade was opened in 2010. This exhibit is home to several species of animal that lived in the wild in Britain hundreds of years ago. These include Eurasian brown bears, wolverines, Eurasian lynx, reindeer, wild boar, and European bison.

===Other animals===
Other species in the zoo&#x27;s collection that are not part of a themed exhibit include Amur tigers, blesbok, Asian small-clawed otters, red pandas, great white pelicans, gemsbok, sloth bears, meerkats, aardvarks, Cape porcupines, common ostriches, reticulated giraffes, southern white rhinoceroses, Przewalski&#x27;s wild horses, chimpanzees, American flamingos, northern rockhopper penguins, Grévy&#x27;s zebra, African wild dogs, bongo, hippopotamus, scimitar-horned oryx, waterbuck, African penguins, ring-tailed lemurs, and marabou storks .

==Daily shows==
The only animal demonstration show is the &#x27;Birds of the World&#x27; ever since Sea Lion Splash closed an the California sea lions were sent to Yorkshire Park.

Talks also take place daily throughout the summer season including lemur talks, giraffe browse and penguin feeding.

==Funding==
The park and ZSL receive no government funding, and rely mainly on entrance fees, memberships, its &#x27;Fellows&#x27; and &#x27;Patrons&#x27; scheme and various corporate sponsorships. The park takes advantage of the Gift Aid charity donation scheme.

==Filming at the zoo==
Whipsnade was one of the sets for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Primeval&quot;, where a ferocious predator from the future kills a lion and three people. The zoo is one of the locations featured in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Super Vets&quot;. It featured in an episode of the CBBC programme &quot;Brum&quot; in 1991, titled &quot;Safari Park&quot;. Jamie Oliver and Sainsbury&#x27;s have also used the zoo&#x27;s background for a 2001 television advert. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot; used parts of Whipsnade as a filming location for Season 1, and the famous lion landmark is featured in behind the scenes footage from the DVDs. The zoo also served as one of the tasks for BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Young, Dumb and Living Off Mum&quot;. &quot;Tots TV&quot; visited Whipsnade.

==Criticism==
In 2002, a 20-year-old elephant named Anna died three days after giving birth to a stillborn calf. There was an allegation that the elephant suffered painful and unnecessary surgery during the birth. The zoo reported that Anna&#x27;s death was due to an infection related to the still birth and that she did not &quot;die in agony&quot;.

In 2021, two female European brown bears were shot and killed after escaping their enclosure during the night. The zoo was criticized for euthanizing the bears, after they used a fallen tree to escape into an adjacent enclosure where they attacked a wild boar. Sam Threadgill, director of the charity Freedom for Animals said: &quot;It was a tragic incident, but it just highlights again why we shouldn’t be keeping animals in zoos&quot;. The zoo&#x27;s chief curator at the time, Malcolm Fitzpatrick, said in a message to staff, &quot;We must quickly make decisions informed by our experience and expertise to protect our people, guests and our other animals&quot;, adding that tranquillizers were not an option as they would have taken 20 minutes to take effect.

==Chimpanzee escape==
In September 2007, two former &#x27;tea party&#x27; chimpanzees named Koko and Jonnie, moved from London Zoo to make way for The Gorilla Kingdom, escaped from their enclosure. Koko followed one of the keepers back to the enclosure but Jonnie started heading towards public grounds. Jonnie was shot dead by the zoo&#x27;s specially trained firearms squad for fears about public safety. The zoo has said that at no point were any members of the public in danger. When asked why they did not use a tranquilliser instead, ZSL spokeswoman Alice Henchley said &quot;It&#x27;s just standard procedure, if the animal cannot be quickly and safely recaptured it will be shot. We can&#x27;t be sure with a tranquillizer&quot;.

==Popular culture==
* In the 1976 movie &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, which takes place on the eve of WW2, the central character (who has failed in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler) played by Peter O&#x27;Toole jeeringly tells the Nazi (John Standing) who catches him if he would donate his remains to Whipsnade Zoo.
* Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Durrell, British naturalist, zookeeper, conservationist, author and television presenter also worked here. After the war, Durrell joined Whipsnade Zoo as a junior or student keeper. This move fulfilled a lifelong dream: Durrell claims in &quot;The Stationary Ark&quot; that the first word that he could enunciate with any clarity was &quot;zoo&quot;. &quot;Beasts in My Belfry&quot; recalls events of this period.

<doc id="477992" wikidata="Q831" url="?curid=477992" title="Ciao">
<text>( , ) is an informal salutation in the Italian language that is used for both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;. 
Originally from the Venetian language, it has entered the vocabulary of English and of many other languages around the world. Its dual meaning of &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot; makes it similar to in Arabic, in Korean, in Hawaiian, () in Persian, and in Vietnamese (the latter is a false cognate; the two words are not linguistically related despite sounding similar to each other).

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Venetian phrase or , literally meaning &quot;(I am) your slave&quot;. This greeting is analogous to the medieval Latin which is still used colloquially in parts of Central/Eastern Europe, or the antiquated English valediction &quot;Your Obedient Servant&quot;. The expression was not a literal statement of fact, but rather a perfunctory promise of good will among friends (along the lines of &quot;at your service&quot; in English). The Venetian word for &quot;slave&quot;, or , derives from Medieval Latin , a loanword from Medieval Greek , related to the ethnic &quot;Slavic&quot;, since most of the slaves at that time came from the Balkans.

This greeting was eventually shortened to , lost all its servile connotations and came to be used as an informal salutation by speakers of all classes. In modern Italian language, the word is used (in addition to the meaning of salutation) as an exclamation of resignation (also in a positive sense), as in (&quot;Oh, well, never mind!&quot;). A Milanese tongue-twister says (&quot;If there is [money], there is; if there isn&#x27;t, farewell! [there&#x27;s nothing we can do]&quot;).

==Spread==
The Venetian &quot;ciào&quot; was adopted by Northern Italian people during the late 19th and early 20th century. Later it became common elsewhere in Italy with the spelling &quot;ciao&quot;. It has since spread to many countries in Europe, along with other items of the Italian culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the greeting (spelled &quot;chau&quot; and only meaning &#x27;bye&#x27;) spread to the Americas—especially Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Brazil (as &quot;tchau&quot;), Venezuela, Panama and Argentina – largely by way of Italian immigrants. In today&#x27;s Cuba, &quot;ciao&quot; as a closing in letters has largely replaced the more traditional , with its religious implications, for many young people. &quot;Ciao&quot; has also permeated Australian culture, becoming a popular greeting among descendants of Italian immigrants. It is also common in some varieties of South African English. &quot;Ciao&quot; has also been used in some parts of Romania as a way to say &#x27;goodbye&#x27;.

Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1929), which is set in northeast Italy during World War I, is credited with bringing the word into the English language.

==Usage as greeting==
In contemporary Italian usage, &quot;ciao&quot; is interchangeable for both an informal hello and goodbye, much like &quot;aloha&quot; in Hawaiian, &quot;salām&quot; in Arabic&quot;, shalom&quot; in Hebrew and &quot;&quot; in Korean. In Italy, &quot;ciao&quot; is mainly used in informal contexts, i.e. among family members, relatives, and friends, in other words, with those one would address with the familiar &quot;tu&quot; (second person singular) as opposed to &quot;Lei&quot; (courtesy form); in these contexts, &quot;ciao&quot; can be the norm even as a morning or evening salutation, in lieu of &quot;buon giorno&quot; or &quot;buona sera&quot;, deemed too formal among friends, relatives, or the very familiar. 

In other languages, &quot;ciao&quot; has come to have more specific meanings. The following list summarizes the spelling and uses of salutations derived from &quot;ciao&quot; in various languages and countries.

*Albanian: &quot;çao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Amharic: ቻው, &quot;chaw&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Bulgarian: чао, &quot;chao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Catalan: &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;txao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Czech: &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;čau&quot;, also &quot;čauky&quot;, &quot;čauves&quot;, &quot;čauky mňauky&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;) and &quot;čau čau&quot; (goodbye)
*Dutch: &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*English: &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Estonian: &quot;tšau&quot;, also &quot;tšauki&quot; - sometimes pronounced with &quot;s&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Finnish: &quot;tsau&quot;, also &quot;tsaukki&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*French: &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;tchao&quot;, &quot;tchô&quot; (mostly used to say &quot;goodbye&quot;). &quot;Tchao&quot; is slang in French. In 1983, this word was used in the title of the popular movie &quot;Tchao, pantin&quot; (&quot;So Long, Stooge&quot;). The variant &quot;tchô&quot; was popularised by the comic book Titeuf &quot;Tchô, monde cruel&quot;.
*German: &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;tschau&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;, in Switzerland also &quot;hello&quot;)
*Greek: τσάο, &quot;tsao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Hebrew: צ&#x27;או &quot;chao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Hungarian: &quot;csáó&quot; or the more informal &quot;csá&quot; or &quot;cső&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Italian: &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;) also &quot;ciao ciao&quot; (bye bye).
*Japanese: チャオ, &quot;chao&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;hi&quot;) also チャオチャオ &quot;chao chao&quot; (bye bye).
*Latvian: &quot;čau&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Lithuanian: &quot;čiau&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;, rarely &quot;hello&quot;)
*Macedonian: чао, &quot;čao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Malay: چاو دولو, &quot;cau dulu&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;); used informally in Malaysia by the leaving party. The word &quot;cau&quot; can be used informally as a verb which means &quot;leave&quot;
*Maltese: &quot;ċaw&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;); also &quot;ċaw ċaw&quot; (&quot;bye bye&quot;)
*Neapolitan: &quot;cià&quot; (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Polish: &quot;ciao&quot; (rare)
*Portuguese: &quot;tchau&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;), &quot;tchau tchau&quot; (&quot;bye bye&quot;), or &quot;tchauzinho&quot; (&quot;little bye&quot;); in Portugal &quot;xau&quot; is also used, without the &quot;t&quot; sound, especially in written informal language such as SMS or web chats
*Romanian: &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;); it is often written as &quot;ceau&quot; although this form is not officially in the Romanian vocabulary
*Russian: чау, чао, &quot;chao&quot;; (&quot;goodbye&quot;); also jokingly - чао-какао, &quot;chao-kakao&quot; (from чай — &quot;tea&quot; and какао — &quot;cocoa&quot;)
*Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian: &quot;ćao&quot; / ћао (informal &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;bye&quot;)
*Sicilian: &quot;ciau&quot; (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;)
*Slovak: &quot;čau&quot; (variations: &quot;čauko&quot;, &quot;čaves&quot;, &quot;čauky&quot;, &quot;čaf&quot;); mostly as &quot;goodbye&quot;, but stands in for &quot;hello&quot; primarily in informal written communication (text messages, emails) and phone calls because it is more character-efficient/shorter and more hip than the Slovak &quot;ahoj&quot;
*Slovene: &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;čau&quot; or &quot;čaw&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;); also &quot;čaw čaw&quot; (&quot;bye bye&quot;)
*Somali: &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Spanish: in Argentina and Uruguay the word &quot;chau&quot; is the most common expression for &quot;goodbye&quot;. In Chile, &quot;chao&quot; is the standard farewell. In Spain, where &quot;adios&quot; (with a religious etymology as &quot;goodbye&quot;, the same as Italian &quot;addio&quot; and French &quot;adieu&quot;, meaning &quot;to God&quot; in English) is the common expression, people can use &quot;chao&quot; as an original way of saying goodbye.
*Swiss-German: &quot;ciao/Tschau&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Tigrinya: ቻው, &quot;chaw&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Turkish: &quot;çav&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot;)
*Venetian: &quot;ciào&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;)
In some languages, such as Latvian, the vernacular version of &quot;ciao&quot; has become the most common form of informal salutation. 

The Vietnamese &quot;&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;) is phonetically similar but not etymologically related.

===Variations===

The dominant use in Latin America uses the term solely as farewell rather than as a greeting.

The greeting has several variations and minor uses. In Italian and Portuguese, for example, a doubled / means specifically &quot;goodbye&quot;, whilst the tripled or quadrupled word (but said with short breaks between each one) means &quot;Bye, I&#x27;m in a hurry!&quot;

Pronounced with a long , it means &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m so glad to meet you!&quot; (be it sincere or sarcastic) in Italian, and a sarcastic or humorous use of &quot;bye!&quot; (cf. American English) in Portuguese. It can be used in Italian to express sarcasm at another person&#x27;s point of view about one topic, especially when that opinion sounds outdated, in which case the meaning is comparable to the English &quot;Yeah, right!&quot;

In all these cases, however, the special meaning is conferred more by the vocal inflection than by the modified use.

<text>Samotlor Field is the largest oil field of Russia and the sixth largest in the world, owned and operated by Rosneft. The field is located at Lake Samotlor in Nizhnevartovsk district, Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Tyumen Oblast. It covers .

==History==
The field was discovered in 1965. Development started in 1967 and first oil was produced in 1969. Discovery of this field had changed Nizhnevartovsk from a small nearby village into a busy oil city as Samotlor used to be the most important oil production base of the Soviet Union. After breakup of the Soviet Union the field was owned by Samotlorneftgaz and TNK-Nizhnevartovsk, which later formed TNK-BP.

Over the all development period a total of 2,086 well clusters (containing more than 17,000 wells) have been built and about 2.6 billion tons of oil has been produced. The peak production occurred in 1980 when Samotlor produced 158.9 million tons of oil (). The production has been in decline ever since, although according to TNK-BP the field production has stabilized over the past last years after.

==Reserves==
The in-place oil reserves of the Samotlor field were equal to and as of 2009 estimated at . The proven reserves are approximately . The field is 80% depleted with water-cut up to 90%. 

At the end of the 1990s, production rate dropped to . However, through an aggressive exploration program and application of cutting-edge technologies TNK-BP had raised production up to . Up to 2012, TNK-BP plans to invest US$1 billion per year for maintaining oil production in it at the level of 30 million tons per year.

==In media==

The oil processing plant in Nizhnevartovsk is the scene of (but referred to by location rather than directly by name) the beginning of Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;.

<text>Bilzingsleben (, lit. &quot;discovery site Bilzingsleben&quot;) is a former stone quarry in Thuringia, Germany, notable for its wealth of palaeolithic human fossils and artifacts.

One of the oldest buildings in the world and one of the oldest pieces of art were found at the site.

==Geology==
Bilzingsleben is located on the northern border of the Thuringian Basin, a depression made of triassic Keuper. To the North are the Kyffhäuser mountains, Hainleite and Schmücke that contain mainly Bunter sandstone and Muschelkalk deposits. The regions are separated by the local &quot;hercynian&quot; fault-line (Finne-Störung). The fault-line is the cause for numerous springs in this area. The emerging spring waters in turn have dissolved the local calcareous rocks and formed the interglacial travertine deposits that cover the Bilzingsleben site. The 400.000 year long conservation is attributed to the travertine&#x27;s remarkable resilience to erosional processes.

The site itself was part of a fluvial terrace in Pleistocene, Central European river basin now situated south of the village of Bilzingsleben, Sömmerda district at above sea level in an old travertine quarry, called &quot;Steinrinne&quot;, where travertines have been quarried since early modern times and the material was used in the towns of the region, for example Kindelbrück&#x27;s city wall.

==History of the excavation==
Fossilized bones at the site had already been found since the 13th century. In 1710 David Siegmund Büttner published his book &quot;Rudera diluvii testes i.e. Zeichen und Zeugen der Sündfluth&quot; (Signs and witnesses of the flood). In 1818 Freiherr Friedrich von Schlotheim (1765-1832) found a human skull covered by lime concretions. It is lost today. In 1908 geologist Ewald Wüst (1875-1934) of the University of Halle-Wittenberg published his first work on local flint artifacts. Amateur researcher Adolf Spengler took up work at the site in 1922.

In 1969 Dietrich Mania, later professor at the University of Jena, discovered numerous fossils and artifacts during a routine investigation. Under the auspices of the Halle State Museum of Prehistory a systematic excavation was launched in 1971 that lasted until 1992 during which were documented and several human fossils were unearthed. Consequently administration of the site has been handed to the University of Jena.

==Dating==

The site belongs to the Reinsdorf interglacial, c. 370,000 BP.

==Human remains==
In 1974 a piece of a human skull was identified among the finds. To date, 37 human bones and teeth have been found, mainly parts of the skull. They represent the remains of at least three individuals and have been classified as &quot;Homo erectus bilzingslebenensis&quot; by Emanuel Vlcek (Prague). The remains of the skulls show that they have been intentionally smashed postmortem, maybe as part of a burial rite.

==Environment==
Both plant impressions in the travertine and pollen remains allow the reconstruction of the local environment. There are two deposition phases. Both are dominated by woodland species. The first phase (limnic chalk mixed with travertine sand) is dominated by hazel (&quot;Corylus&quot;), ash (&quot;Fraxinus&quot;) and oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;). The second phase (pure limnic chalk) is dominated by hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus&quot;), alder (&quot;Alnus&quot;) and pine (&quot;Pinus&quot;).

36 plant species are attested by impressions in the travertine, among them 14 tree and shrub species:
* Pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;)
* Maple (&quot;Acer campestre&quot;, &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;)
* Large-leaved linden (&quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot;)
* European ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;)
* European cornel (&quot;Cornus mas&quot;)
* Common hazel (&quot;Corylus avellana&quot;)
* Common aspen (&quot;Populus tremula&quot;)
* Downy birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;)
* European box (&quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot;)
* European barberry (&quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot;)
* Hungarian lilac (&quot;Syringa josikaea&quot;)
* European nettle tree (&quot;Celtis australis&quot;)
* Scarlet firethorn (&quot;Pyracantha coccinea&quot;)
* Shrubby cinquefoil (&quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot;).

The woods were mainly made up of oaks and box (Buxo-Quercetum). Herbs like wormwood, sorrel, ferns and grasses attest the presence of open steppes or meadows. Sedges and rushes grew on the lakeshore, waterlilies and &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss in the lakes.

The remains of 54 species of animals have been found in Bilzingsleben, 35 species of mammals, six kinds of birds, three reptiles, three amphibians and five kinds of fishes. Among the mammals are:
* Straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;)
* Rhinoceros (&quot;Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis&quot;, &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus&quot;)
* Aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;)
* Steppe wisent (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;)
* Horse (&quot;Equus&quot; sp.)
* Red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;)
* Fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;)
* Giant deer (&quot;Megaloceros&quot; sp.)
* Roe deer (&quot;Capreolus suessenbornensis&quot;)
* Bear (&quot;Ursus deningeri-spelaeus&quot;)
* Lion (&quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;)
* European wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;)
* Red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;)
* Wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;)
* Wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;)
* Barbary macaque (&quot;Macaca sylvana&quot;)
* A now extinct beaver (&quot;Trogontherium cuvieri&quot;).

Woodland animals predominate, but there are some species that prefer more open habitats as well, like rhinoceros, horse and bison. Mollusks attest to a climate that was warmer and wetter than today. The average annual temperature is supposed to have been 9° to 13°C, the annual precipitation 800 mm.

===Special finds===

The lithic industry is characterized by chopping tools of diminutive sizes. There are no true hand axes. The raw material is mainly flint, although quartzite, quartz and travertine have been used as well. There are numerous bone tools (hoes, scrapers, points and gougers). Some hoes are made of antler or ivory. Even wooden artefacts have been preserved.
One bone fragment, an elephant tibia, has two groups of 7 and 14 incised parallel lines and might represent an early example of art. The regular spacing of the incisions, their subequal lengths and V-like cross-sections suggest they were created at the same time, with a single stone tool. The tibia dates to between 350,000 and 400,000 years ago. The interpretation as an early calendar is a possibility.

==Structures==

D. Mania found large stones arranged in a circular manner. He thought that it probably was a base for a dwelling. However, ring-center analysis showed that the site was an open air site. C. Gamble proposed that humans congregated at the site around the fire.

<doc id="478003" wikidata="Q2290276" url="?curid=478003" title="Season finale">
<text>A season finale (British English: series finale; Australian English: season final) is the final episode of a season of a television program. This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer, and, as such, will attempt to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again.

A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season. Alternatively, a season finale could bring storylines to a close, &quot;going out on a high&quot; and similarly maintaining interest in the series&#x27; eventual return.

==Mid-season finale==
In the 2000s, the terms &quot;mid-season finale,&quot; &quot;fall finale,&quot; or &quot;winter finale&quot; began being used by television broadcasters in the United States to denote the last episode before a mid-season hiatus, often for the holiday season. As with a season finale, a mid-season finale can include a major plot development, or a cliffhanger ending that will be resolved when the series returns. Winter/Fall finales are often used by networks to draw attention and encourage viewership of such episodes as event television, especially if they fall during the November sweeps period. The practice has faced criticism for affecting the structure and narrative of broadcast television programs, as writers may be coerced by broadcasters into placing cliffhangers and plot developments in midseason episodes, rather than allow a plot to build up to a traditional season finale.

==Series finale==

The &quot;final&quot; episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show, wrapping up any loose ends and storylines. On occasion, the season finale has become the series finale due to cancellation of the series, sometimes unexpectedly so, leaving plot points unresolved.

==In sports==
In American English, the term has evolved to describe the final event of a sporting season, e.g. in soccer or motocross, perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers.

<doc id="478004" wikidata="Q388801" url="?curid=478004" title="Furosemide">
<text>Furosemide, sold under the brand name Lasix among others, is a loop diuretic medication used to treat edema due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. Furosemide may also be used for the treatment of high blood pressure. It can be taken intravenously or orally. When given intravenously, furosemide typically takes effect within five minutes; when taken orally, it typically metabolizes within an hour.
Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension (decrease in blood pressure while standing, and associated lightheadedness), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and photosensitivity (sensitivity to light). Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. It is recommended that serum electrolytes (especially potassium), serum , creatinine, BUN levels, and liver and kidney functioning be monitored in patients taking furosemide. It is also recommended to be alert for the occurrence of any potential blood dyscrasias. 

Furosemide works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Common side effects of furosemide injection include hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypotension (low blood pressure), and dizziness.
Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, it is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 24th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 23million prescriptions. In 2020/21 it was the twentieth most prescribed medication in England. It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s banned drug list due to concerns that it may mask other drugs. It has also been used in race horses for the treatment and prevention of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage.

==Medical uses==

Furosemide is primarily used for the treatment of edema, but also in some cases of hypertension (where there is also kidney or heart impairment). It is often viewed as a first-line agent in most people with edema caused by congestive heart failure because of its anti-vasoconstrictor and diuretic effects. Compared with furosemide, however, torasemide (aka &quot;torsemide&quot;) has been demonstrated to show improvements to heart failure symptoms, possibly lowering the rates of rehospitalization associated with heart failure, with no difference in risk of death. Torsemide may also be safer than furosemide. Providing self-administered subcutaneous furosemide has been found to reduce hospital admissions in people with heart failure, resulting in significant savings in healthcare costs.

Furosemide is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, nephrotic syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid diuresis is required (IV injection), and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.

===Kidney disease===
In chronic kidney diseases with hypoalbuminemia, furosemide is used along with albumin to increase diuresis. It is also used along with albumin in nephrotic syndrome to reduce edema.

===Other information===
Furosemide is mainly excreted by tubular secretion in the kidney. In kidney impairment, clearance is reduced, increasing the risk of adverse effects. Lower initial doses are recommended in older patients (to minimize side effects) and high doses may be needed in kidney failure. It can also cause kidney damage; this is mainly by loss of excessive fluid (i.e., dehydration), and is usually reversible.

Furosemide acts within 1 hour of oral administration (after IV injection, the peak effect is within 30 minutes). Diuresis is usually complete within 6–8 hours of oral administration, but there is significant variation between individuals.

==Adverse effects==
Furosemide also can lead to gout caused by hyperuricemia. Hyperglycemia is also a common side effect.

The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration (hypokalemia) has given rise to combination products, either with potassium or with the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride (Co-amilofruse). Other electrolyte abnormalities that can result from furosemide use include hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.

In the treatment of heart failure, many studies have shown that the long-term use of furosemide can cause varying degrees of thiamine deficiency, so thiamine supplementation is also suggested.

Furosemide is a known ototoxic agent generally causing transient hearing loss but can be permanent. Reported cases of furosemide-induced hearing loss appeared to be associated with rapid intravenous administration, high dosages, concomitant renal disease, and coadministration with other ototoxic medication. However, a recently reported longitudinal study showed that participants treated with loop diuretics over 10 years were 40% more likely to develop hearing loss and 33% more likely of progressive hearing loss compared to participants who did not use loop diuretics. This suggests the long-term consequences of loop diuretics on hearing could be a more significant than previously thought and further research is required in this area.  

Other precautions include nephrotoxicity, sulfonamide (sulfa) allergy, and increased free thyroid hormone effects with large doses.

== Interactions ==
Furosemide has potential interactions with these medications:
* Aspirin and other salicylates
* Other diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, hydrochlorothiazide)
* Synergistic effects with other antihypertensives (e.g. doxazosin)
* Sucralfate

Potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs:
* Analgesics: increased risk of kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; antagonism of diuretic effect with NSAIDs
* Antiarrhythmics: a risk of cardiac toxicity exists with antiarrhythmics if hypokalemia occurs; the effects of lidocaine and mexiletine are antagonized.
* Antibacterials: increased risk of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides, polymyxins and vancomycin; avoid concomitant use with lymecycline
* Antidepressants: increased risk of hypokalemia with reboxetine; enhanced hypotensive effect with MAOIs; increased risk of postural hypotension with tricyclic antidepressants
* Antiepileptics: increased risk of hyponatremia with carbamazepine
* Antifungals: increased risk of hypokalemia with amphotericin
* Antihypertensives: enhanced hypotensive effect; increased risk of first dose hypotensive effect with alpha-blockers; increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias with sotalol if hypokalemia occurs
* Antipsychotics: increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias with amisulpride, sertindole, or pimozide (avoid with pimozide) if hypokalemia occurs; enhanced hypotensive effect with phenothiazines
* Atomoxetine: hypokalemia increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias
* Cardiac glycosides: increased toxicity if hypokalemia occurs
* Cyclosporine: variable reports of increased nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and hepatotoxicity
* Lithium: risk of toxicity.

==Mechanism of action==

Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal Na–K–Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the Na-K-2Cl transporter, thus causing more sodium, chloride, and potassium to be excreted in the urine.

The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by the development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. Furosemide has been reported to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at μM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors. During development, the α6β2γ2 receptor increases in expression in cerebellar granule neurons, corresponding to increased sensitivity to furosemide.

The pharmacokinetics of furosemide are not significantly altered by food.

No direct relationship has been found between furosemide concentration in the plasma and furosemide efficacy. Efficacy depends upon the concentration of furosemide in urine.

==Names==
Furosemide is the INN and BAN. The previous BAN was frusemide.

Brand names under which furosemide is marketed include Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Farsiretic, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusemide, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furantril, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furon, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lasix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Seguril, Teva-Furosemide, Trofurit, Uremide, and Urex.

==Veterinary uses==

The diuretic effects are put to use most commonly in horses to prevent bleeding during a race. In the United States of America, under the racing rules of most states, horses that bleed from the nostrils (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) three times are permanently barred from racing. Sometime in the early 1970s, furosemide&#x27;s ability to prevent, or at least greatly reduce, the incidence of bleeding by horses during races was discovered accidentally. Clinical trials followed, and by the decade&#x27;s end, racing commissions in some states in the USA began legalizing its use on race horses. In 1995, New York became the last state in the United States to approve such use, after years of refusing to consider doing so. Some states allow its use for all racehorses; some allow it only for confirmed &quot;bleeders&quot;. Its use for this purpose is still prohibited in many other countries.

Furosemide is also used in horses for pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure (in combination with other drugs), and allergic reactions. Although it increases circulation to the kidneys, it does not help kidney function and is not recommended for kidney disease.

It is also used to treat congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and/or ascites) in cats and dogs.

===Horses===
Furosemide is injected either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0 mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a metabolic alkalosis due to hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The drug should, therefore, not be used in horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.

Furosemide should be used with caution when combined with corticosteroids (as this increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases the risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthetics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, it decreases the kidneys&#x27; ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.

Furosemide may increase the risk of digoxin toxicity due to hypokalemia.

It is recommended that furosemide not be used during pregnancy or in a lactating mare, as it is passed through the placenta and milk in studies with other species. It should not be used in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (Equine Cushing&#x27;s Disease).

Furosemide is detectable in urine 36–72 hours following injection. Its use is restricted by most equestrian organizations.

US major racetracks ban the use of furosemide on race days.

<text>The Borscht Belt, or Yiddish Alps, is a region which was noted for its summer resorts that catered to Jewish vacationers, especially residents of New York City. The resorts, now mostly defunct, were located in the southern foothills of the Catskill Mountains in parts of Sullivan and Ulster counties in the U.S. state of New York, bordering the northern edges of the New York metropolitan area.

&quot;In its heyday, as many as 500 resorts catered to guests of various incomes.&quot; These resorts, as well as the Borscht Belt bungalow colonies, were a popular vacation spot for New York City Jews from the 1920s through the 1960s. By the late 1950s, many began closing, with most gone by the 1970s, but some major resorts continued to operate, a few into the 1990s.

==Name==
The name comes from borscht, a soup of Ukrainian origin (made with beets as the main ingredient, giving it a deep reddish-purple color) that is popular in many Central and Eastern European countries and brought by Ashkenazi Jewish and Slavic immigrants to the United States. The alliterative name was coined by Abel Green, then editor of &quot;Variety&quot;, and is a play on existing colloquial names for other American regions (such as the Bible Belt and Rust Belt). An alternate name, the &quot;Yiddish Alps&quot;, was used by Larry King and is satirical: a classic example of borscht belt humor.

==History==

After the expansion of the railway system including the tracks Ontario and Western as well as the Ulster and Delaware Railroad, the area of the Catskill Mountains became a tourist destination because of the beauty of the landscape, which impressed the painters of American Romanticism, and because of the rising popularity of fly fishing in its trout-rich rivers. As New York City streets would bake in the summer and air-conditioning was not yet available, people flocked to the Catskills. 

In the early 1900s, some hotels&#x27; and resorts&#x27; advertisements refused to accept Jews and indicated &quot;No Hebrews or Consumptives&quot; in their ads. This discrimination led to a need for alternative lodging that would readily accept Jewish families as guests. Visits to the area by Jewish families were already underway &quot;as early as the 1890s ... Tannersville ... was &#x27;a great resort of our Israelite &#x27; ... from the 1920s on [there were] hundreds of hotels.&quot; The larger hotels provided &quot;Friday night and holiday services as well as kosher cooking&quot;, thus supporting religious families to take a vacation in accordance to their customs. 

=== Rise ===
Borscht Belt hotels, bungalow colonies, summer camps, and &quot;kuchaleyns&quot; (kuch-alein, literally: &quot;Cook it yourself&quot;, a Yiddish name for self-catered boarding houses) flourished. The bungalows usually included &quot;a kitchen/living room/dinette, one bedroom, and a screened porch&quot; with entertainment at the casino, the communal center, being simple: bingo or a movie. The &quot;kuchaleyns&quot; were often visited by lower middle-class and working-class Jewish New Yorkers. Because of the many Jewish guests, this area was nicknamed the &quot;Yiddish Alps&quot; or &quot;Solomon County&quot; (a malapropism of Sullivan County) by many people who visited there.
A sufficient choice of Jewish cuisine was an important feature of the hotels in the Borscht Belt, and &quot;too much was not enough&quot; developed as a notion. Jonathan Sarna wrote: &quot;To understand the emphasis on food, one has to understand hunger. Immigrants had memories of hunger, and in the Catskills, the food seemed limitless.&quot; The singles scene was also important; many hotels hired young male college students to attract single girls of a similar age. One book on the era contended that &quot;the Catskills became one great marriage broker.&quot;

Borscht Belt resorts stood in towns such as Liberty, Fallsburg, Mamakating, Thompson, Bethel and Rockland in Sullivan County as well as Wawarsing and Rochester in Ulster County. Such resorts included Avon Lodge, Brickman&#x27;s, Brown&#x27;s, Butler Lodge, The Concord, Grossinger&#x27;s, Granit, the Heiden Hotel, Irvington, Kutsher&#x27;s Hotel and Country Club, the Nevele, Friar Tuck Inn, the Laurels Hotel and Country Club, the Pines Resort, Raleigh Hotel, the Overlook, the Tamarack Lodge, Shady Nook Hotel and Country Club, Stevensville, Stier&#x27;s Hotel, and the Windsor. Some of these hotels originated from farms that Jewish immigrants established in the early part of the 20th century.

Two of the larger hotels in High View (just north of Bloomingburg) were Shawanga Lodge and the Overlook. One of the high points of Shawanga Lodge&#x27;s existence came in 1959 when it was the site of a conference of scientists researching laser beams. The conference marked the start of serious research into lasers. The hotel burned to the ground in 1973. The Overlook, which offered rooms in the main building as well as bungalows, spiced up with entertainment, was operated by the Schrier family.

===Decline===
The Borscht Belt reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s with over 500 resorts, 50,000 bungalows, and 1,000 rooming houses but the start of a decline was apparent by the late 1960s. &quot;Railways began cutting service to the area, the popularity of air travel increased, and a younger generation of Jewish-Americans chose other leisure destinations.&quot; A secondary factor was that &quot;anti-Semitism declined, so Jews could go other places.&quot;

Access to the area improved with the opening of the George Washington Bridge and upgrade of old travel routes such as old New York State Route 17. On the other hand, passenger train access ended with the September 10, 1953 termination of passenger trains on the Ontario and Western Railway mainline from Roscoe at the northern edge of Sullivan County, through the Borscht Belt, to Weehawken, New Jersey. A 1940 vacation travel guide published by the railroad listed hundreds of establishments that were situated at or near the railway&#x27;s stations. The following year, the New York Central ceased running passenger trains on its Catskill Mountain Branch. The area suffered as a travel destination in the late 1950s and especially by the 1960s. Another source also confirms that &quot;cheap air travel suddenly allowed a new generation to visit more exotic and warmer destinations.&quot; More women remained in the workforce after marriage and could not take off for the entire summer to relocate to the Catskills.

A &quot;Times of Israel&quot; article specifies that &quot;the bungalow colonies were the first to go under, followed by the smaller hotels. The glitziest ones hung on the longest&quot; with some continuing to operate in the 1980s and even in the 1990s. Bungalow colonies fell into disrepair or many of the nicer ones have been converted into a housing co-op. The Concord Resort Hotel, which outlasted most other resorts, went bankrupt in 1997 but survived until 1998 and was subsequently demolished for a possible casino site. By the early 1960s, some 25 to 30 percent of Grossinger&#x27;s Catskill Resort Hotel visitors were not Jewish; nevertheless it closed in 1986. 

The Stevensville Hotel in Swan Lake was located on the shores of an artificial reservoir of the West Branch Mongaup River which fed a tannery since the 1840s. It was commissioned in 1924 and managed by the Dinnerstein and Friehling families until around 1990.
It reopened as &quot;Swan Lake Resort Hotel&quot; in 1999 offering Asian cuisine plus Tennis &amp; Golf facilities but only survived until 2007.
In 2015 the ultra-Orthodox Congregation Iched Anash bought the property for $2.2 million and began to operate the &quot;Satmar Boys Camp&quot;, a religious summer school (yeshiva gedolah).

In 1987, New York City mayor Ed Koch proposed buying the Gibber Hotel in Kiamesha Lake to house the homeless. The idea was opposed by local officials and the hotel instead became the religious school Yeshiva Viznitz.

The Granit Hotel and Country Club, located in Kerhonkson, boasted many amenities, including a golf course. It closed in 2015 and was renovated and turned into the Hudson Valley Resort and Spa, which closed in 2018. The property was sold in May 2019 to Hudson Valley Holding Co. LLC. The company did not announce its plans for the hotel.

==21st century==
As of the 2010s, the region is a summer home for many Orthodox Jewish families. Some of the hotels have been converted into rehab centers, meditation centers or Orthodox Jewish hotels and resorts. The former Homowack Lodge in Phillipsport was converted into a summer camp for Hasidic girls. Officials of the state Department of Health ordered the property evacuated in July 2009, citing health and safety violations. The Orthodox Jews who flock to the region each summer provide commerce that the area would not have otherwise. The Flagler Hotel, Nemerson, Schenk&#x27;s and Windsor Hotels in South Fallsburg, and the Stevensville Hotel in Swan Lake, were converted into Jewish religious summer camps.

In 1984, the Catskills division of Hatzalah was founded which covers the Borscht Belt and served the needs of a growing Orthodox clientele; as of 2020 a volunteer force of 450 rescue workers and paramedics is operating a fleet of 18 ambulances. Although financially independent from the other chapters, it cooperates in day-to-day business with Central Hatzalah of NYC as the 17. neighborhood and also with State Forces (police, forest rangers, emergency medical services, fire departments).

Many Buddhist and Hindu retreat centers have been constructed on the land or in the restored buildings of former camps or resorts to serve adherents in New York City, the establishment of which has then drawn even more temples and centers to the area. This led to the coining of the nicknames &quot;Buddha Belt,&quot; &quot;Bhajan Belt&quot; and &quot;Buddhist Belt&quot; to refer to the area&#x27;s revival.

Despite the region&#x27;s decline as a cultural epicenter, a handful of traveling acts, such as the Doox of Yale, continue to regularly tour the Borscht Belt.

Between 2013 and 2018, the decaying state of the abandoned resorts was captured by several ruins photographers:
* Grossinger&#x27;s Catskill Resort Hotel; the Grossinger&#x27;s complex partially was demolished in 2018 and a new owner planned to build a hotel, homes and other amenities. A remaining structure on the property was destroyed by fire in August 2022.
* Kutsher&#x27;s Hotel and Country Club; a wellness club was built on the site and opened in June 2018. The original Kutcher&#x27;s nightclub is all that remains of the original hotel. The Kutcher&#x27;s Hotel front electric sign was donated to the Sullivan County Historical Museum.
* The Pines Hotel closed in 1998. The dilapidated main building and surrounding structures remained in a state of decay until it was destroyed in a fire in June 2023. The Pines Hotel golf course has been converted into a Jewish religious summer camp.
* The former Gilbert&#x27;s Hotel and Brickman Hotel are not part of the Siddha Yoga SYDA complex. A gift shop remains open at the sites, which are not in current active use.
* Nevele Grand Hotel
* The Vegetarian Hotel
* White Lake Mansion House
* Homowack Lodge
* Lesser Lodge
* Tamarack Lodge
* Concord Resort Hotel (In February 2018, Resorts World Catskills opened on the site of the old hotel.)

==Comedic legacy==

The tradition of Borscht Belt entertainment started in the early 20th century with the Paradise Garden Theatre constructed in Hunter, New York by Yiddish theater star Boris Thomashefsky. A cradle of American Jewish comedy since the 1920s, the Borscht Belt entertainment circuit has helped launch the careers of many famous comedians and acted as a launchpad for those just starting out.

Borscht Belt humor refers to the rapid-fire, often self-deprecating style common to many of these performers and writers. Typical themes include:

* Bad luck: &quot;I told the doctor I broke my leg in two places. He told me to quit going to those places.&quot; (Henny Youngman)
* Puns: &quot;Sire, the peasants are revolting!&quot; &quot;You said it. They stink on ice.&quot; (Harvey Korman as Count de Money (Monet) + Mel Brooks as King Louis XVI, in &quot;History of the World Part I&quot;)
* Physical complaints and ailments (often relating to bowels and cramping): &quot;My doctor said I was in terrible shape. I told him, &#x27;I want a second opinion.&#x27; He said, &#x27;All right, you&#x27;re ugly too! &quot;I told my doctor, &#x27;This morning when I got up and saw myself in the mirror, I looked awful! What&#x27;s wrong with me?&#x27; He replied, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, but your eyesight is perfect! (Dangerfield)
* Aggravating relatives and nagging wives: &quot;My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.&quot; (Dangerfield). &quot;Take my wife—please!&quot; (Henny Youngman); &quot;My wife drowned in the pool because she was wearing so much jewelry.&quot; (Don Rickles); &quot;My wife ain&#x27;t too bright. One day our car got stolen. I said to her, &#x27;Did you get a look at the guy?&#x27; She said, &#x27;No, but I got the license number. (Dangerfield) &quot;This morning the doorbell rang. I said &#x27;Who is it?&#x27; She said &#x27;It&#x27;s the Boston Strangler.&#x27; I said &#x27;It&#x27;s for you dear! (Youngman)

==Historical Marker Project==

The Borscht Belt Historical Marker Project was founded by Marisa Scheinfeld, a noted Borscht Belt historical photographer, author, and Borscht Belt documentarian, in 2022. Scheinfeld had photographed the detritus of the former Borscht Belt hotels, bungalows, and historically important sites. She recognized the complete absence of any historical interpretive roadside markers documenting the sites of the former Borscht Belt.

The Borscht Belt Historical Marker Project initiated a unique program to place 20 vertical interpretive highway markers strategically sited to tell the story of the Borscht Belt and interpret the specific locations. The markers are enhanced with QR pegs for more in-depth explanations. A self-guided audio tour system is being developed. 

The markers are double-sided with representative images. All carry an interpretive text about the specific area on one side and the following common text about the Borscht Belt on the other side: 
&quot;From the 1920s through the early 1970s, the Borscht Belt was the preeminent summer resort destination for hundreds of thousands of predominantly east coast American Jews. The exclusion of the Jewish community from existing establishments in the 1920s drove Jewish entrepreneurs to create over 500 resorts, 50,000 bungalows and 1,000 rooming houses in Sullivan County and parts of Ulster County. The Borscht Belt provided a sense of community for working and vacationing Jews. The era exerted a strong influence on American culture, particularly in the realm of entertainment, music, and sports. Some of the most well-known and influential people of the 20th century worked and vacationed in the area. Beginning around 1960, the Borscht Belt began a gradual demise due to many factors including the growth of suburbia, inexpensive airfare, and generational changes.&quot;

As of 2024, the Program has completed and sited nine markers in Sullivan County - Monticello, Mountain Dale, Swan Lake, Fallsburg, Kiamisha Lake, South Fallsburg, Hurleyville, Bethel, and Woodridge. Loch Sheldrake, Parksville, Livingston Manor, and Ellenville are being prepared for 2025. Six additional markers are planned for 2026. The Borscht Belt Historical Marker Project is funded by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation.

==In popular culture==
The Heiden Hotel in South Fallsburg was the film location of the 1987 movie &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; starring Maureen Stapleton. It was destroyed by fire in May 2008 while no longer hosting guests.

In the same year, the movie &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; replayed the heyday of the Borscht Belt in an upscale resort. The plot was inspired by the screenwriter&#x27;s experience as a teenager in the summertime community at Grossinger&#x27;s.

In the graphic novel &quot;Maus: A Survivor&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1991), Art Spiegelman&#x27;s father Vladek spends the summer in a bungalow settlement in the Catskills and visits with his son at the nearby The Pines resort.

In the second season of the series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (2017–23), both the Weissman and Maisel families spend a summer vacation at Steiner&#x27;s Resort in the Catskills, depicted by Scott&#x27;s Family Resort on Oquaga Lake in Deposit, NY.

Also, Jason Reitman&#x27;s historical dramedy film, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (2024), depicts the chaos surrounding the 1975 telecast production hassles of Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) and the ensemble cast during the series premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In one scene, Brad Garrett plays an unidentified Borscht Belt stand-up comedian whose routine is bombing, but whose Borscht-esque humor is being transcribed by writer Alan Zweibel (portrayed by Josh Brener).

<text>The Corn Belt is a region of the Midwestern United States and part of the Southern United States that, since the 1850s, has dominated corn production in the United States. In North America, &quot;corn&quot; is the common word for maize. More generally, the concept of the Corn Belt connotes the area of the Midwest dominated by farming and agriculture, though it stretches down into the South as well reaching into Kentucky.

==Geography==
There is lack of consensus regarding the constituents of the Corn Belt, although it often includes Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, southern Michigan, western Ohio, eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas, southern Minnesota, and parts of Missouri. It also sometimes includes South Dakota, North Dakota, all of Ohio, Wisconsin, all of Michigan, and Kentucky. Some people and industries break the Corn Belt down even further and refer to it as the Eastern Corn Belt and the Western Corn Belt.

The region is characterized by level land, deep fertile soils, and a high organic soil concentration.

As of 2008, the top four corn-producing states were Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota, accounting for more than half of the corn growth in the U.S.

More recently, the Corn Belt was mapped at the county level using the Land use and Agricultural Management Practices web-Service (LAMPS), along with animated maps of changes in time (2010–2016).

==History==

William Scully (1821-1906), from a wealthy landowning Catholic family in West Tipperary, Ireland, immigrated to Chicago in 1851. He bought up hundreds of thousands of acres of prime Corn Belt farmland in the Midwest, and rented it to tenants. By 1906 he owned and 225,000 acres in Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri, renting it out to 1200 tenants.

On account of new agricultural technology developments between 1860 and 1970, the Corn Belt went from producing mixed crops and livestock into becoming an area focused strictly on wheat-cash planting. After 1970, increased crop and meat production required an export outlet, but global recession and a strong dollar reduced exports and created serious problems even for the best farm managers.

In 1956, former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, a pioneer of hybrid seed, declared that the Corn Belt had developed the &quot;most productive agricultural civilization the world has ever seen&quot;.

Most corn grown today is fed to livestock, especially hogs and poultry. In recent decades, soybeans have grown in importance. 

By 1950, 99% of corn has been grown from hybrids.

==EPA Ecoregion==
In 1997, the USEPA published its report on the United States&#x27; ecoregions, in part based on &quot;land use&quot;. Its &quot;Level III&quot; region classification contains three contiguous &quot;Corn Belt&quot; regions, Western (47), Central (54), and Eastern (55), stretching from Indiana to eastern Nebraska.

<doc id="478023" wikidata="Q310493" url="?curid=478023" title="Robert Wagner">
<text>Robert John Wagner Jr. (born February 10, 1930) is an American actor. He is known for starring in the television shows &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1968–1970), &quot;Switch&quot; (1975–1978), and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979–1984). He later had recurring roles on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2007–2008) and &quot;NCIS&quot; (2010–2019).

In films, Wagner is known for his role as Number 2 in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; trilogy of films (1997, 1999, 2002), as well as for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954), &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1956), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), &quot;Harper&quot; (1966), &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Concorde... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979).

== Early life ==

Wagner was born in Detroit, to Thelma Hazel Alvera (née Boe; 1898–1993), a former telephone operator, and Robert John Wagner Sr (1890–1964), a traveling salesman who worked for the Ford Motor Company. He had one older sister, Mary Scott (1926–2023).

Wagner&#x27;s mother came from La Crosse, Wisconsin. Her parents were both immigrants from Norway, who married in La Crosse in 1887. Wagner&#x27;s father was a native of Kalamazoo, Michigan. His parents were from Germany.

The family moved to Bel-Air, an upscale area of Los Angeles, in 1937.

== Career ==
=== 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures ===
Wagner became interested in acting, and after an unsuccessful screen test directed by Fred Zinnemann for his film &quot;Teresa&quot; (1951), was represented by Albert R. Broccoli. He made his uncredited film debut in &quot;The Happy Years&quot; (1950); was signed by agent Henry Willson and put under contract with 20th Century Fox.

&quot;I started off as an ingenue&quot;, recalled Wagner. &quot;I was 19 years old. I was the boy next door. But you always felt you could work your way up, that you could have a better part in the next picture. [Head of Fox] Darryl Zanuck was always placing me in different positions.&quot;

Wagner&#x27;s first film for Fox was &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1951), a World War II film. Wagner had a supporting role, with Richard Widmark as the star. The studio then had him perform a similar function in another war movie, &quot;The Frogmen&quot; (1951), again with Widmark; the cast also included another young male under contract to the studio, Jeffrey Hunter, with whom Wagner would often work. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make It Legal&quot; (1951) was a comedy where Wagner again supported an older star, in this case Claudette Colbert.

Wagner first gained significant attention with a small but showy part as a shell-shocked soldier in &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952).

&quot;You were part of 20th Century Fox&quot;, he said. &quot;You felt proud of being part of the organization. When I wasn&#x27;t working, I was on the road, going out and selling movies or dancing on the stage and meeting the public. They never let you rest.&quot;

20th Century Studios started to give Wagner better roles. He was the romantic male lead in &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (1952), a biopic about John Philip Sousa starring Clifton Webb. He supported James Cagney and Dan Dailey in John Ford&#x27;s version of &quot;What Price Glory&quot; (1952) and supported Webb again in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953). He was in a minor Western, &quot;The Silver Whip&quot; (1953) with Rory Calhoun.

==== Leading man ====

Fox gave Wagner his first starring role in &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot; (1953). Reviews were poor but the movie was only the third ever to be shot in CinemaScope and was a big hit.
Also popular was a Western, &quot;Broken Lance&quot; (1954), where Wagner supported Spencer Tracy for director Edward Dmytryk, appearing as Tracy&#x27;s son. Fox gave Wagner the lead in an expensive spectacular, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954). While popular, critical reception was poor and Wagner later joked his wig in the movie made him look like Jane Wyman. He was teamed with Jeffrey Hunter in a Western, &quot;White Feather&quot; (1955).

Wagner was borrowed by Paramount for &quot;The Mountain&quot; (1956), directed by Dmytryk, where Wagner was cast as Spencer Tracy&#x27;s brother, having played his son just two years earlier in the same director&#x27;s &quot;Broken Lance&quot;. He received more critical acclaim for the lead in &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1956), from the novel by Ira Levin; it was made for Crown Productions, a company of Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s brother in law (the leads were all under contract to Fox) and released through United Artists.

Back at Fox Wagner was in &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1956), a war movie, and &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot; (1957), playing the leading role for director Nicholas Ray (Jeffrey Hunter was Frank). Both movies were box office disappointments and it seemed Wagner was unable to make the transition to top-level star. This appeared confirmed when he was the lead in &quot;Stopover Tokyo&quot; (1957). In 1959, Wagner disparaged the film:
When I started at Fox in 1950 they were making sixty-five pictures a year. Now they&#x27;re lucky if they make thirty. There was a chance to get some training in B pictures. Then TV struck. Everything went big and they started sticking me into Cinemascope spectacles. One day, smiling Joe Juvenile with no talent was doing a role intended for John Wayne. That was in a dog called &quot;Stopover Tokyo&quot;. I&#x27;ve really had to work to keep up.
Wagner supported Robert Mitchum in a Korean War movie, &quot;The Hunters&quot; (1958), and appeared with a number of Fox contractees in a World War II drama, &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1958).

After a cameo in &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1958), Wagner supported Bing Crosby and Debbie Reynolds in &quot;Say One for Me&quot; (1959).

Trying to kick-start his career, Wagner appeared with his then-wife Natalie Wood (they married in 1957) in &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot; (1960), made for MGM.

In January 1961, Wagner and Wood formed their own company, Rona Productions, named after the first two letters of both their first names. Rona signed a three-picture deal with Columbia pictures for Wagner&#x27;s services, which was to start with &quot;Sail a Crooked Ship&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Interns&quot;. He also had a deal to make one more film at Fox, which was to be &quot;Solo&quot;, the story of a jazz drummer directed by Dick Powell, or &quot;The Comancheros&quot; with Gary Cooper.

Wagner made &quot;Sail a Crooked Ship&quot; but his part in &quot;The Interns&quot; went to James MacArthur. &quot;Solo&quot; was never made, and &quot;The Comancheros&quot; was made instead with John Wayne and Stuart Whitman. Wagner did make &quot;The War Lover&quot; (1962) with Steve McQueen that was filmed in England.

=== Europe ===
Wagner&#x27;s first marriage to Wood had broken up, and he relocated to Europe. He had a small role in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), produced by Daryl Zanuck for Fox. He had a larger part in &quot;The Condemned of Altona&quot; (1962), a commercial and critical disappointment despite being directed by Vittorio de Sica and co-starring Sophia Loren.

Considerably more popular was &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), a massive hit, although Wagner&#x27;s part was very much in support to those of David Niven, Capucine, Peter Sellers, and Claudia Cardinale. It was directed by Blake Edwards, who wanted Wagner for the lead in &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), but Jack L. Warner overruled him.

=== Return to Hollywood and Universal Pictures ===

His return to America found him playing in the theatre for the first time with the lead role in Mister Roberts for one week at a holiday resort just outside Chicago. The disciplines of the theatre were not his forte and Wagner was glad to be back in Hollywood to find a good supporting role in the modern-day private investigator hit, &quot;Harper&quot; (1966), starring Paul Newman.

Wagner signed with Universal Pictures in 1966, starring opposite future wife Jill St. John in the films &quot;How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot;, a made-for-TV movie released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Deadly Roulette&quot;, and &quot;Banning&quot; (1967). He returned to Italy to make a caper film with Raquel Welch for MGM, &quot;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&quot; (1968).

=== Television star ===
In 1967, Lew Wasserman of Universal convinced Wagner to make his television series debut in &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1968–1970) on ABC-TV. &quot;&quot;I was opposed to doing &quot;Thief&quot;&quot;, Wagner said later. &quot;But Lew Wasserman said: &#x27;I want you to be in TV Guide every week. This is your medium, you&#x27;ve got to try it, you&#x27;ll be great.&#x27; Roland Kibbee wrote the part for me, and I would have missed all that if I hadn&#x27;t listened to Lew.&quot;

While the success of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; and &quot;Harper&quot; began Wagner&#x27;s comeback, the successful two-and-a-half seasons of his first TV series completed it. In this series, he acted with Fred Astaire, who played his father. Wagner was a longtime friend of Astaire, having gone to school with Astaire&#x27;s eldest son, Peter. Wagner&#x27;s performance would earn him an Emmy nomination for Best TV Actor.

During the making of the series he made a film for Universal, the comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Stand There!&quot; (1968) with Mary Tyler Moore. It was not a success. More popular was &quot;Winning&quot; (1969), a racing car drama where Wagner supported Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. He also guest-starred in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1970).

Wagner&#x27;s friend and agent Albert Broccoli suggested that he audition to play James Bond, but he decided it was not right for him.

Wagner appeared in the series pilot, &quot;City Beneath the Sea&quot; (1971), that was not picked up. The following year, he produced and cast himself opposite Bette Davis in the made-for-TV film &quot;Madame Sin&quot;, which was theatrically released overseas as a feature film.

He was a regular in the BBC/Universal World War II prisoner-of-war drama &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–1974) for much of its run. He reunited with McQueen, along with Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway, in the disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; released in the same year. It was a massive hit, although Wagner&#x27;s part was relatively small.

==== &quot;Switch&quot; ====

By the mid-1970s, Wagner&#x27;s television career was at its peak with the CBS-TV television series &quot;Switch&quot; (1975–1978, opposite Eddie Albert, Sharon Gless, and Charlie Callas) after re-signing a contract with Universal in 1974. Albert had been a childhood hero of Wagner&#x27;s, after he watched the movie &quot;Brother Rat&quot;, along with a few others. The friendship started in the early 1960s, where he also co-starred in a couple of Albert&#x27;s movies. After the end of the series, the two remained friends until Albert&#x27;s death on May 26, 2005. Wagner spoke at his funeral, and gave a testimonial about his longtime friendship with him.

In partial payment for starring together in the Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg production of the TV movie &quot;The Affair&quot;, Wagner and Natalie Wood were given a share in three TV series that the producers were developing for ABC. Only one reached the screen, the very successful TV series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, for which Wagner and Wood had a 50% share, though Wagner was to spend many years in court arguing with Spelling and Goldberg over what was defined as profit.

Wagner and Wood acted with Laurence Olivier in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1976), as part of Olivier&#x27;s television series &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; for the UK&#x27;s Granada Television.

Wagner had a small role in some all-star Universal films, &quot;Midway&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Concorde... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979).

==== &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; ====
Wagner&#x27;s third successful series was &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, which co-starred Stefanie Powers and Lionel Stander and was broadcast on ABC-TV from 1979 to 1984. No one else was seriously considered for the role. George Hamilton had a high-profile at the time and was suggested, but producer Aaron Spelling said that if he was cast &quot;the audience will resent him as Hart for being that rich. But no one will begrudge RJ [Wagner] a nickel.&quot;

During the series run, Wagner reprised his old Pink Panther role in &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983). He also had a supporting role in &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; (1983).

Wagner played an insurance investigator in the short-lived TV series &quot;Lime Street&quot; (1985).

In 1985, he reflected, &quot;Bad-guy roles work if they&#x27;re really good parts, but they don&#x27;t come along very often. I think that what I&#x27;ve been doing has worked for me. Sure I&#x27;d like to do a Clint Eastwood, grizzled, down-and-out guy, but there aren&#x27;t many scripts like that... What has been projected for me is an international quality that can take me anywhere and get me into all kind of involvements; to do otherwise would mean a character role.&quot;

=== Later career ===
Wagner appeared in a TV movie with Audrey Hepburn, &quot;Love Among Thieves&quot; (1987) and in a miniseries with Jaclyn Smith, &quot;Windmills of the Gods&quot; (1988). He and St. John worked with Pierce Brosnan in the miniseries remake of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1989). For Tom Mankiewicz, he played a supporting part in &quot;Delirious&quot; (1991). More widely seen was &quot;&quot; (1993), where Wagner played a producer. Wagner played &quot;Love Letters&quot; on stage with Stefanie Powers. They also reprised their Hart characters in a series of TV movies.

Wagner&#x27;s film career received a boost after his role in the Austin Powers series of spy spoofs starring Mike Myers. Wagner played Dr. Evil&#x27;s henchman Number 2 in all three films: &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999) and &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002). He also had small roles in &quot;Wild Things&quot; (1998), &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; (1999), &quot;Play It to the Bone&quot; (2000), &quot;Becoming Dick&quot; (2001) and &quot;Sol Goode&quot; (2001).

Wagner became the host of Fox Movie Channel&#x27;s &quot;Hour of Stars&quot;, featuring original television episodes of &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot; (1955), a series which he had appeared on in his early days with the studio. In 2005, he became the television spokesman for the Senior Lending Network, a reverse mortgage lender and in 2010 he began serving as a spokesman for the Guardian First Funding Group, also a reverse mortgage lender. In June 2011, Guardian First Funding was acquired by Urban Financial Group, who continued to use Wagner as their spokesperson.

In 2007, Wagner had a role in the BBC/AMC series &quot;Hustle&quot;. In season four&#x27;s premiere, Wagner played a crooked Texan being taken for half a million dollars. As Wagner is considered &quot;a suave icon of American caper television, including &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;&quot;, Robert Glenister (&quot;Hustle&quot;″s fixer, Ash Morgan) commented that &quot;to have one of the icons of that period involved is a great bonus for all of us&quot;. Wagner also played the pivotal role of President James A. Garfield in the comedy/horror film &quot;Netherbeast Incorporated&quot; (2007). The role was written with Wagner in mind. He had a recurring role of a rich suitor to the main characters&#x27; mother on the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. His final appearances on the show were in May 2008.

Wagner has guest-starred in 13 episodes of &quot;NCIS&quot; as Anthony DiNozzo Sr., the father of Anthony DiNozzo Jr., played by Michael Weatherly. Weatherly had previously appeared as Wagner in the TV movie &quot;The Mystery of Natalie Wood&quot;.

Wagner was set to star as Charlie in the 2011 remake of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, but he had to exit the project due to scheduling conflicts.

Despite his apparent feeling of distaste when he was working with Raquel Welch on &quot;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&quot;, they reunited 50 years later on the 2017 Canadian series &quot;Date My Dad&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In his memoirs, Wagner said he had had affairs with Yvonne De Carlo, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Anita Ekberg, Shirley Anne Field, Lori Nelson, and Joan Collins. He also claimed a four-year romantic relationship with Barbara Stanwyck after they acted together in the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953). According to Wagner, because of their age difference—he was 22, she was 45—they kept the affair secret to avoid damaging their careers. He is also rumored to have had affairs with men, although Wagner identifies as heterosexual.

In 1956, when he was 26 years old, Wagner became involved with 18-year-old actress Natalie Wood. They were married on December 28, 1957, in Scottsdale, Arizona. At some point during the first half of 1961, according to several published accounts, Wood caught him having an extramarital affair with a man in the couple&#x27;s home. They announced their separation on June 20, 1961, and divorced on April 27, 1962.
While working on location in Europe, Wagner reconnected with an old friend, actress Marion Marshall. After a two-year courtship, Wagner, Marshall and her two sons from her marriage to Stanley Donen moved back to America. Wagner and Marshall married on July 21, 1963, at the Bronx Courthouse. They had a daughter, Katie (born May 11, 1964). They separated in June 1970 and divorced on October 14, 1971.

Wagner was engaged to Tina Sinatra from June 1970 until January 1972. Immediately afterwards, Wagner rekindled his romance with Wood. They remarried on July 16 aboard the &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Rose&quot;, anchored off Paradise Cove in Malibu. They had a daughter, Courtney (born March 9, 1974). Following Wood&#x27;s death in 1981, Wagner became the legal guardian of her daughter by producer Richard Gregson, Natasha, then 11. He also gradually cut ties with his former sister-in-law, Lana Wood. Lana has claimed publicly that the reason behind the couple&#x27;s first divorce was that Natalie caught Wagner in the arms of another man.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1982, Wagner began dating actress Jill St. John, whom he had known since the late 1950s. After eight years together, they married on May 26, 1990, in Pacific Palisades. The marriage is the fourth for both Wagner and St. John and it has lasted longer than all six of their previous marriages combined. The couple co-starred in six films between 1967 and 2014—most of them low-budget—as well as the pilot episode of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, and also appeared onstage in a 1996 production of &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

Wagner became a first-time grandfather in 2006 when Katie Wagner, his daughter with Marshall, gave birth to her son Riley John Wagner-Lewis.

In 2007, Wagner and St. John sold the Brentwood ranchette they had lived in since 1983 for a reported $14 million. The couple now reside in Aspen, Colorado, where they built a vacation home in 1995. They retain a condo in L.A.

== Death of Natalie Wood ==
On November 29, 1981, Wood died under mysterious circumstances near, within a mile of, or on the 55-foot yacht &quot;Splendour&quot; while it was moored near the isthmus of Santa Catalina Island. Wood had been on board the &quot;Splendour&quot; along with Wagner, Christopher Walken, who was co-starring with her in the motion picture &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983), and Dennis Davern, the &quot;Splendour&quot;″s captain. No explanation has ever been given for the absence of Walken&#x27;s wife Georgianne. According to Wagner, Wood was not on the yacht when he went to bed, and, according to his spokesman, he thought Wood had taken off on a small inflatable boat by herself, as she had done before. Wood&#x27;s body was found about a mile away from the yacht, while the inflatable boat was found beached nearby. The autopsy report revealed that Wood had 39 fresh bruises on her body, including an abrasion on her left cheek.

Later, in his memoir &quot;Pieces of My Heart&quot;, Wagner acknowledged that he had an argument with Wood before she disappeared but had calmed down and gone to bed. The autopsy found that Wood&#x27;s blood alcohol content was 0.14% and there were traces of two types of medication in her bloodstream: a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller, both of which increase the effects of alcohol. Two witnesses, who had been on another boat nearby, stated they had heard a woman scream for help during the night. Following his investigation, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled her death an accident by drowning and hypothermia.

Wagner, Walken, and Davern initially all told detectives that Wood had left in a dinghy to go ashore; the case was reopened in November 2011 after Davern publicly stated that he had lied to police during the initial investigation and that Wood and Wagner had had an argument that evening. He alleged that Wood had been flirting with Walken, that Wagner was jealous and enraged, and that following Wood&#x27;s disappearance, Wagner had prevented Davern from turning on the search lights and notifying authorities. According to Davern, Wagner was responsible for Wood&#x27;s death and he believed that Wagner had intentionally kept the investigation into Wood&#x27;s death &quot;low-profile&quot;.

In 2012, Los Angeles County Chief Coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran amended Wood&#x27;s death certificate and changed the cause of her death from accidental drowning to &quot;drowning and other undetermined factors&quot;. The amended document included a statement that the circumstances of how Wood ended up in the water are &quot;not clearly established.&quot; On January 14, 2013, the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office issued a ten-page addendum to Wood&#x27;s autopsy report. It stated that she may have sustained some of the bruises on her body before she went into the water and drowned.

On February 1, 2018, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department named Wagner a &quot;person of interest&quot; in the investigation into Wood&#x27;s death. Robert Wagner has denied any involvement in Wood&#x27;s death. On May 27, 2022, Lieutenant Hugo Reynaga announced that all leads in the case have been exhausted and that the case remains open and unsolved.

<text>Pleroma (, literally &quot;fullness&quot;) generally refers to the totality of divine powers. It is used in Christian theological contexts, as well as in Gnosticism. The term also appears in the Epistle to the Colossians, which is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle. The word is used 17 times in the New Testament.

== Etymology ==
The word literally means &quot;fullness&quot;, from the verb (, &quot;to fill&quot;), from (, &quot;full&quot;).

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The word itself is a relative term, capable of many shades of meaning, according to the subject with which it is joined and the antithesis to which it is contrasted. It denotes the result of the action of the verb &quot;pleroun;&quot; but &quot;pleroun&quot; is either 
*to fill up an empty thing (&quot;e.g.&quot; ), or 
*to complete an incomplete thing (&quot;e.g.&quot; );

and the verbal substantive in -&quot;ma&quot; may express either

#the objective accusative after the verb, &#x27;the thing filled or completed,&#x27; or 
# the cognate accusative, &#x27;the state of fulness or completion, the fulfilment, the full amount,&#x27; resulting from the action of the verb (, , , ).

It may emphasize totality in contrast to its constituent parts; or fullness in contrast to emptiness (&quot;kenoma&quot;); or completeness in contrast to incompleteness or deficiency ( , ; ).

A further ambiguity arises when it is joined with a genitive, which may be either subjective or objective, the fulness which one thing gives to another, or that which it receives from another.

In its semi-technical application it is applied primarily to the perfection of God, the fullness of His Being, &#x27;the aggregate of the Divine attributes, virtues, energies&#x27;: this is used quite absolutely in (), but further defined 
# as , &#x27;the whole completeness of the Divine nature,&#x27; in , 
#as , &#x27;the whole (moral) perfection which is characteristic of God,&#x27; in .

Secondarily, this same &quot;pleroma&quot; is transferred to Christ; it was embodied permanently in Him at the Incarnation (); it still dwells permanently in His glorified Body, (); it is (), the complete, moral, and intellectual perfection to which Christians aspire and with which they are filled (, . Cf. , where &quot;pleroma&quot; is the state of Him who is , , cf. ). This indwelling emphasizes the completeness with which the Son represents the Father; it is the fulness of life which makes Him the representative, without other intermediary agencies, and ruler of the whole universe; and it is the fulness of moral and intellectual perfection which is communicable through Him to man; it is consistent with a gradual growth of human faculties (), therefore with the phrase of , which is perhaps intended as a deliberate contrast to it. One further application of the phrase is made in (), where it is used of the Church, . Here the genitive is perhaps subjective—the fulness of Christ, His full embodiment, that fulness which He supplies to the Church—emphasizing the thoroughness with which the Church is the receptacle of His powers and represents Him on earth. The analogy of the other uses of the word with the genitive of the person (, ), and the stress throughout these books on Christians being filled by Christ (, , , , , , , ), favours this view. But the genitive may be objective, &#x27;the complement of Christ,&#x27; that which completes Him, which fills up by its activities the work which His withdrawal to heaven would have left undone, as the body completes the head. The analogy of the body, the stress laid on the action of the Church (), the language about Paul himself in (), support this, and it is impossible to decide between the two. The former view has been most common since the thorough examination of the word by Fritzsche and Lightfoot (&quot;Col.&quot;), and was taken by von Soden (&quot;Hand-Comm.&quot;). But the latter view, which was that of Origen and Chrysostom, has been strongly advocated by Pfleiderer, and T. K. Abbott (&quot;International Critical Comm.&quot;).

Outside the NT the word occurs in Ignatius in a sense which is clearly influenced by the NT, and apparently in the meaning of the Divine fulness, as going forth and blessing and residing in the Church (&quot;Eph&quot;. Inscr. , and &quot;Trall&quot;. Inscr. , almost = &quot;en Christo&quot;).

===Gnosticism===

In Gnosticism the use becomes more technical, though its applications are still very variable. The Gnostic writers appeal to the use in the NT (evidenced in Irenaeus&#x27; account of their views and his corresponding refutation, ), and the word retains from it the sense of totality in contrast to the constituent parts; but the chief associations of &quot;pleroma&quot; in their systems are with Greek philosophy, and the main thought is that of a state of completeness in contrast to deficiency (, ; Hippol. vi. 31), or of the fullness of real existence in contrast to the empty void and unreality of mere phenomena (&quot;kenoma&quot;, ). Thus in Cerinthus it expressed the fulness of the Divine Life out of which the Divine Christ descended upon the man Jesus at his baptism, and into which He returned (, , ). In the Valentinian system it stands in antithesis to the essential incomprehensible Godhead, as &#x27;the circle of the Divine attributes,&#x27; the various means by which God reveals Himself: it is the totality of the thirty aeons or emanations which proceed from God, but are separated alike from Him and from the material universe. It is at times almost localized, so that a thing is spoken of as &#x27;within,&#x27; &#x27;without,&#x27; &#x27;above,&#x27; &#x27;below&#x27; the Pleroma: more often it is the spirit-world, the archetypal ideal existing in the invisible heavens in contrast to the imperfect phenomenal manifestations of that ideal in the universe. Thus &#x27;the whole Pleroma of the aeons&#x27; contributes each its own excellence to the historic Jesus, and He appears on earth &#x27;as the perfect beauty and star of the Pleroma&#x27; (, ). Similarly it was used by writers as equivalent to the full completeness of perfect knowledge (&quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, p. 15).

Again, each separate aeon is called a &quot;pleroma&quot; in contrast to its earthly imperfect counterpart, so that in this sense the plural can be used, &quot;pleromata&quot; (); and even each individual has his or her Pleroma or spiritual counterpart (&quot;to pleroma autes&quot; of the Samaritan woman,—Heracleon, &quot;ap.&quot; Origen, xiii. p. 205).

It thus expressed the various thoughts which we should express by the Godhead, the ideal, heaven; and it is probably owing to this ambiguity, as well as to its heretical associations, that the word dropped out of Christian theology. It is still used in its ordinary untechnical meaning, &quot;e.g.&quot; Theophylact speaks of the Trinity as &quot;pleroma tou theou&quot;; but no use so technical as that in Ignatius reappears.

==Middle Platonism==
John M. Dillon, in &quot;Pleroma and Noetic Cosmos: A Comparative Study&quot;, states that Gnosticism imported its concept of the ideal realm, or pleroma, from Plato&#x27;s concept of the cosmos and Demiurge in &quot;Timaeus&quot; and of Philo&#x27;s Noetic cosmos in contrast to the aesthetic cosmos. Dillon does this by contrasting the Noetic cosmos to passages from the Nag Hammadi, where the aeons are expressed as the thoughts of God. Dillon expresses the concept that pleroma is a Gnostic adaptation of Hellenic ideas, since before Philo there is no Jewish tradition that accepts that the material world or cosmos was based on an ideal world that exists as well.

== Social sciences ==
===Carl Jung===
Carl Jung used the word in his mystical work, &quot;Seven Sermons to the Dead&quot;, first published anonymously in 1916, and the only part of &quot;Liber Novus&quot; (&quot;The Red Book&quot;) to be published before his death. According to Jung, the pleroma is the totality of all opposites.

===Gregory Bateson===
In his &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;, Gregory Bateson adopts and extends Jung&#x27;s distinction between &quot;pleroma&quot; (the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity) and &quot;creatura&quot; (the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information). What Bateson calls the &quot;myth of power&quot; is the epistemologically false application to Creatura of an element of Pleroma (non-living, undifferentiated).

<doc id="478055" wikidata="Q2006755" url="?curid=478055" title="Bombacaceae">
<text>Bombacaceae were long recognised as a family of flowering plants or Angiospermae. The family name was based on the type genus &quot;Bombax&quot;. As is true for many botanical names, circumscription and status of the taxon has varied with taxonomic point of view, and currently the preference is to transfer most of the erstwhile family Bombacaceae to the subfamily Bombacoideae within the family Malvaceae in the order Malvales. The rest of the family were transferred to other taxa, notably the new family Durionaceae. Irrespective of current taxonomic status, many of the species originally included in the Bombacaceae are of considerable ecological, historical, horticultural, and economic importance, such as balsa, kapok, baobab and durian.

==Current taxonomy==
Recent phylogenetic research has shown that Bombacaceae as traditionally circumscribed (including tribe Durioneae) is not a monophyletic group. Bombacaceae is no longer recognized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group I 1998, II 2003 and Kubitzki system 2003 at the rank of family, the bulk of the taxa in question being treated as subfamilies Bombacoideae and Helicteroideae within family Malvaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. A close relationship between Bombacaceae and Malvaceae has long been recognized but until recently the families have been kept separate in most classification systems, and continue to be separated in many references, including the reference work in classification of flowering plants: Heywood &quot;et al.&quot; 2007 and Takhtajan 2009, but have been lumped together in Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.

Heywood &quot;et al.&quot; say &quot;although closely related to Malvaceae, molecular data supports their separation. Only pollen and habit seem to provide a morphological basis for the separation.&quot; On the other hand, they say: &quot;One approach is to lump them [the families in the core Malvales, including Bombacaceae] all into a &#x27;super&#x27; Malvaceae, recognizing them as subfamilies. The other, taken here, is to recognize each of these ten groups as families.&quot;

As circumscribed in its traditional sense, the family Bombacaceae includes around 30 genera (25 genera after Heywood &quot;et al.&quot; ) with about 250 species of tropical trees, some of considerable girth, so called &quot;bottle trees&quot;. Many species grow to become large trees, with &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; the tallest, reaching a height to 70 m. Several of the genera are commercially important, producing timber, edible fruit or useful fibres. The family is noted for some of the softest hardwoods commercially traded, especially balsa, &quot;Ochroma lagopus&quot;. The fruit of the durian, &quot;Durio zibethinus&quot; is famous, tasting better than it smells. At one time kapok fibre from the tree &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; was used in making lifebuoys. The baobabs or &quot;bottle trees&quot; (&quot;Adansonia&quot; spp.) are important icons in certain parts of Africa, Australia and Madagascar, noted for their immensely stout trunk development, a mechanism for enhancing water storage.

<text>Durio is a genus of plants in the family Malvaceae. Several species produce an edible fruit known as durian, the most common species being &quot;Durio zibethinus&quot;. There are 30 recognized species in the genus &quot;Durio&quot;, but only nine produce edible fruit.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Durio sensu lato&quot; has 30 recognised species. &quot;Durio sensu stricto&quot; comprises 24 of these species. The 6 additional species included in &quot;Durio s.l.&quot; are now considered by some to comprise their own genus, &quot;Boschia&quot;. &quot;Durio s.s.&quot; and &quot;Boschia&quot; have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial difference between the two is that anther locules open by apical pores in &quot;Boschia&quot; and by longitudinal slits in &quot;Durio s.s.&quot; These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, &quot;Cullenia&quot;. These three genera together form a clade that is characterised by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.

The genus &quot;Durio&quot; is placed by some taxonomists in the family Bombacaceae, or by others in a broadly defined Malvaceae that includes Bombacaceae, and by others in a smaller family of just seven genera, Durionaceae.

&quot;Durio&quot; is often included in Bombacaceae because of the presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesise that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).

== Description ==
There are 30 recognized species in the genus &quot;Durio&quot;, but only nine produce edible fruit. Durian is the only species available on the international market: the other species are sold only in their local regions. The name &quot;durian&quot; is derived from the Indo-Malay word &quot;duri&quot; which refers to the fruit&#x27;s many protuberances.

Often considered the king of fruits, durian is distinguished by its large size, arresting odor, and fearsome thorny husk. The fruit can grow up to 30 centimeters long and 15 centimeters in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms. Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the color of its husk from green to brown, and its flesh from pale yellow to red, depending on the species.

The edible flesh emits a distinctive odor that is strong and penetrating, even when the husk is intact. The smell, depending on the person, evokes rotting onions, turpentine, or even sewage, yet to others its odor is welcoming and appetizing. The persistence of its odor has led to its ban in some hotels and public transport in Southeast Asia.

On March 4, 2023, a plane flying from Istanbul to Barcelona was forced to turn back because of the nauseating odor of the tropical fruit, transported in the hold.

<text>Livio Berruti (born 19 May 1939) is an Italian former athlete who was the winner of the 200-meter dash in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

He won five medals, at individual level, and three medals with the national relay team at the International athletics competitions.

==Biography==

Berruti was born in Turin where he attended Liceo Classico &quot;Cavour&quot;. After high school, while pursuing a degree in chemistry, he competed in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In the semi-finals of the 200 m, spurred by the home crowd, he unexpectedly ran in 20.5 seconds, equalling the then world record for that distance. This made him a surprise outsider for the final, later that day. In that race, Berruti, who was noted for always running with black glasses and white socks, once again clocked 20.5, beating the American favourites to the gold medal.

Anchoring the Italian 4 × 100 m relay team, Berruti narrowly missed out on a second Olympic medal, finishing in 4th. His world record was not beaten until June 1962, but his performance remained a European record for a further two years, until 21 June 1964.

His Olympic victory, at the beginning of his career, would remain his best achievement. His three appearances at the European Championships only brought him a 7th place in the 1966 200 m final. He did, however, win Italian titles in both the 100 and 200 m from 1957 until 1962, and two more 200 m titles in 1965 and 1968. Berruti also made two more Olympic appearances, in 1964 and 1968. On both occasions, he reached the final of the 4 × 100 m relay, and also placed 5th in the 200 m final of 1964.

==Olympic results==
==National titles==
Livio Berruti has won 14 times the individual national championship.
*6 wins in the 100 metres (1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962)
*8 wins in the 200 metres (1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1968)

<text>Pancake sorting is the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. A &quot;pancake number&quot; is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. In this form, the problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. A variant of the problem is concerned with &quot;burnt&quot; pancakes, where each pancake has a burnt side and all pancakes must, in addition, end up with the burnt side on bottom.

All sorting methods require pairs of elements to be compared. For the traditional sorting problem, the usual problem studied is to minimize the number of comparisons required to sort a list. The number of actual operations, such as swapping two elements, is then irrelevant. For pancake sorting problems, in contrast, the aim is to minimize the number of operations, where the only allowed operations are reversals of the elements of some &quot;prefix&quot; of the sequence. Now, the number of comparisons is irrelevant.

==The pancake problems==
===The original pancake problem===
The minimum number of flips required to sort any stack of pancakes has been shown to lie between and (approximately 1.07&quot;n&quot; and 1.64&quot;n&quot;), but the exact value is not known.

The simplest pancake sorting algorithm performs at most flips. In this algorithm, a kind of selection sort, we bring the largest pancake not yet sorted to the top with one flip; take it down to its final position with one more flip; and repeat this process for the remaining pancakes.

In 1979, Bill Gates and Christos Papadimitriou gave a lower bound of (approximately 1.06&quot;n&quot;) flips and an upper bound of . The upper bound was improved, thirty years later, to by a team of researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas, led by Founders Professor Hal Sudborough.

In 2011, Laurent Bulteau, Guillaume Fertin, and Irena Rusu proved that the problem of finding the shortest sequence of flips for a given stack of pancakes is NP-hard, thereby answering a question that had been open for over three decades.

===The burnt pancake problem===
In a variation called the burnt pancake problem, the bottom of each pancake in the pile is burnt, and the sort must be completed with the burnt side of every pancake down. It is a &quot;signed permutation&quot;, and if a pancake &quot;i&quot; is &quot;burnt side up&quot; a negative element &quot;i`&quot; is put in place of &quot;i&quot; in the permutation. In 2008, a group of undergraduates built a bacterial computer that can solve a simple example of the burnt pancake problem by programming &quot;E. coli&quot; to flip segments of DNA which are analogous to burnt pancakes. DNA has an orientation (5&#x27; and 3&#x27;) and an order (promoter before coding). Even though the processing power expressed by DNA flips is low, the high number of bacteria in a culture provides a large parallel computing platform. The bacteria report when they have solved the problem by becoming antibiotic resistant.

==The pancake problem on strings==
The discussion above presumes that each pancake is unique, that is, the sequence on which the prefix reversals are performed is a &quot;permutation&quot;. However, &quot;strings&quot; are sequences in which a symbol can repeat, and this repetition may reduce the number of prefix reversals required to sort. Chitturi and Sudborough (2010) and Hurkens et al. (2007) independently showed that the complexity of transforming a compatible string into another with the minimum number of prefix reversals is NP-complete. They also gave bounds for the same. Hurkens et al. gave an exact algorithm to sort binary and ternary strings. Chitturi (2011) proved that the complexity of transforming a compatible signed string into another with the minimum number of signed prefix reversals—the burnt pancake problem on strings—is NP-complete.

==History==
The pancake sorting problem was first posed by Jacob E. Goodman, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Harry Dweighter&quot; (&quot;harried waiter&quot;).

Although seen more often as an educational device, pancake sorting also appears in applications in parallel processor networks, in which it can provide an effective routing algorithm between processors.

The problem is notable as the topic of the only well-known mathematics paper by Microsoft founder Bill Gates (as William Gates), entitled &quot;Bounds for Sorting by Prefix Reversal&quot; and co-authored with Christos Papadimitriou. Published in 1979, it describes an efficient algorithm for pancake sorting. In addition, the most notable paper published by &quot;Futurama&quot; co-creator David X. Cohen (as David S. Cohen), co-authored with Manuel Blum, concerned the burnt pancake problem.

The connected problems of signed sorting by reversals and sorting by reversals were also studied more recently. Whereas efficient exact algorithms have been found for the signed sorting by reversals, the problem of sorting by reversals has been proven to be hard even to approximate to within certain constant factor, and also proven to be approximable in polynomial time to within the approximation factor 1.375.

==Pancake graphs==

An &quot;n&quot;-pancake graph is a graph whose vertices are the permutations of &quot;n&quot; symbols from 1 to &quot;n&quot; and its edges are given between permutations transitive by prefix reversals. It is a regular graph with n! vertices, its degree is n−1. The pancake sorting problem and the problem to obtain the diameter of the pancake graph are equivalent.

The pancake graph of dimension &quot;n&quot;, Pn can be constructed recursively from n copies of Pn−1, by assigning a different element from the set {1, 2, …, n} as a suffix to each copy.

Their girth:

:formula_1.

The γ(Pn) genus of Pn is:

:formula_2

Since pancake graphs have many interesting properties such as symmetric and recursive structures, small degrees and diameters compared against the size of the graph, much attention is paid to them as a model of interconnection networks for parallel computers. When we regard the pancake graphs as the model of the interconnection networks, the diameter of the graph is a measure that represents the delay of communication.

The pancake graphs are Cayley graphs (thus are vertex-transitive) and are especially attractive for parallel processing. They have sublogarithmic degree and diameter, and are relatively sparse (compared to e.g. hypercubes).

== Algorithm ==
An example of the pancake sorting algorithm is given below in Python. The code is similar to bubble sort or selection sort. 

def flip(arr, k: int) -&gt; None:
 left = 0
 while left &lt; k:
 arr[left], arr[k] = arr[k], arr[left]
 k -= 1
 left += 1

def max_index(arr, k: int) -&gt; int:
 index = 0
 for i in range(k):
 if arr[i] &gt; arr[index]:
 index = i
 return index

def pancake_sort(arr) -&gt; None:
 n = len(arr)
 while n &gt; 1:
 maxidx = max_index(arr, n)
 if maxidx != n - 1:
 if maxidx != 0:
 flip(arr, maxidx)
 flip(arr, n - 1)
 n -= 1

arr = [15, 8, 9, 1, 78, 30, 69, 4, 10]
pancake_sort(arr)
print(arr)

<text>The Ishikawajima Ne-20 () was Japan&#x27;s first turbojet engine. It was developed during World War II in parallel with the nation&#x27;s first military jet, the Nakajima Kikka.

==Design and development==
The decision to manufacture this engine came about because of the unsuitability of two earlier powerplants selected for the Kikka, the Tsu-11 and the Ne-12.

Only a small number of these engines, perhaps fifty, were produced before the end of the war. Two of them were used to power the Kikka on its only flight on August 7, 1945. Only a few of the engines under construction survived. It was also planned to use the engine to power a version of the Ohka kamikaze weapon, but this was not implemented before the end of the war.

==Variants==
;Ne-20:Standard production engines
;Ne-20-Kai: Up-rated version

==Engines on display==

Three Ne-20s have been preserved to the present day, one at Ishikawajima-Harima&#x27;s internal company museum in Tanashi, and two at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

<text>Li Yaotang (; 25 November 1904 – 17 October 2005), better known by his pen name Ba Jin () or his courtesy name Li Feigan (), was a Chinese anarchist, translator, and writer. In addition to his impact on Chinese literature, he also wrote three original works in Esperanto, and as a political activist he wrote &quot;The Family&quot;.

== Name ==
He was born as Li Yaotang, with alternate name Li Feigan or Li Pei Kan (in Wade–Giles). The first word of his pen name may have been taken from Ba Embo, his classmate who committed suicide in Paris, which was admitted by himself, or from the first syllable of the surname of the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin; and the last character of which is the Chinese equivalent of the last syllable of Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin (克鲁泡特金, Ke-lu-pao-te-jin).

==Biography==

On November 25, 1904, Li Yaotang was born in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, into a wealthy Li family. The family&#x27;s wealth came mainly from the land acquired by his grandfather and father when they were officials, and Li Yaotang sometimes described his family as a &quot;typical landlord&#x27;s family&quot;. In 1919, Ba read Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;An Appeal to the Young&quot; and converted to anarchism.

It was partly owing to boredom that Ba Jin began to write his first novel, &quot;Miewang&quot; (“Destruction”). In France, Ba Jin continued his anarchist activism, translating many anarchist works, including Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, into Chinese, which was mailed back to Shanghai&#x27;s anarchist magazines for publication.

During the Cultural Revolution, Ba Jin was heavily persecuted as a counter-revolutionary. His wife since 1944, Xiao Shan, died of cancer in 1972. He asked that a Cultural Revolution Museum be set up in 1981. The Shantou Cultural Revolution Museum referenced the influence of Ba Jin on its establishment through displaying a depiction of his at the entrance as well as a quote of his, &quot;Every town in China should establish a museum about the Cultural Revolution.&quot;

Ba Jin&#x27;s works were heavily influenced by foreign writers, including Émile Zola, Ivan Turgenev, Alexander Herzen, Anton Chekhov, and Emma Goldman.

Ba Jin suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease beginning in 1983. The illness confined him to Huadong Hospital in Shanghai from 1998.

<text>Shen Congwen (28 December 1902 – 10 May 1988), formerly romanized as Shen Ts&#x27;ung-wen, was a Chinese writer who is considered one of the greatest modern Chinese writers, on par with Lu Xun. Regional culture and identity plays a much bigger role in his writing than that of other major early modern Chinese writers. He was known for combining the vernacular style with classical Chinese writing techniques. Shen is the most important of the &quot;native soil&quot; writers in modern Chinese literature. Shen Congwen published many excellent compositions in his life, the most famous of which is the novella &quot;Border Town&quot;. This story is about the old ferryman and his granddaughter Cuicui&#x27;s love story. Shen Congwen and his wife Zhang Zhaohe were married in 1933, Shen Congwen and Zhang Zhaohe had two sons and one daughter after their marriage.

He was slated to win the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, but died before he could be awarded the prize.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
He was born Shen Yuehuan () on 28 December 1902 in the town of Fenghuang (then known as Zhen&#x27;gan) in west Hunan Province. In late adolescence he chose the name Shen Congwen. He was the fourth of nine children born to Shen Zongsi, a Han-Miao, and Huang Suying, a Tujia. His grandfather, Shen Hongfu, was a local hero who became a decorated general before being named acting commander-in-chief of Guizhou province at the age of 25. Due in large part to his grandfather&#x27;s fame and fortune, Shen Congwen was born into a relatively well-off household. Following the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, his father hoped to become elected to the provincial assembly, but was instead forced to go into hiding in Inner Mongolia after joining a failed plot to assassinate President Yuan Shikai. The fact of Shen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s Tujia ethnicity and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s Miao ethnicity, he keep secret until the 1980s.

Owing to his father&#x27;s sudden disappearance, the family fortunes gradually diminished. Most of their land was sold off, and in 1917, after graduating from primary school, Shen Congwen was made to leave home. He joined a local reserve militia before joining the regiment in Yuanling (then known as Chenzhou) working as a clerk.

===Education===
Many early modern writers in China were well-educated, and some studied abroad, often in Japan. Shen Congwen, however, received a modest formal education. As a child he received private tutoring at home followed by a private family school. These private tutorials were conducted in an outdated, classical scholarly style which Shen criticized as neither useful nor interesting. In 1915, he began attending the Fenghuang town primary school, from which he graduated in 1917.

As a child he disliked school. In his autobiography, he describes frequently cutting class. According to Shen, this educational experience formed the foundation of his later professional and emotional life, &quot;Having learned to use my eyes to take in everything in this world, to live amid all life, I found school unspeakably boring.&quot; This school-of-life brand of personal education is central to the image of Shen Congwen. Mo Yan, in his Nobel lecture given after receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2012, compares himself to Shen, &quot;I left school as a child, often went hungry, was constantly lonely, and had no books to read. But for those reasons, like the writer of a previous generation, Shen Congwen, I had an early start on reading the great book of life. My experience of going to the marketplace to listen to a storyteller was but one page of that book.&quot;

In 1923, after serving five years in the militia in Hunan, Shen left for Beijing to pursue higher education. Having failed the university entrance exam, he pursued independent study while auditing classes at Peking University.

In 1949, he was attacked on big character posters at the Peking University campus for not heralding the Communist cause. Suffering from depression and social ostracization, he slit his wrists and throat with a razor blade.

=== Career ===
On 22 December 1924, the &quot;Morning Supplement&quot; first published his essay &quot;An Unposted Letter&quot; (Chinese: 一封未曾付邮的信; pinyin: &quot;Yī fēng wèi céng fù yóu dē xìn&quot;). He began publishing short stories and essays regularly in &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot; and &quot;Crescent Moon&quot;, two highly influential literary magazines of the New Culture Movement. In 1925 Shen became a student of Professor Lin Zaiping, who introduced him to the famous modernist poet Xu Zhimo. In the 1930s he gained fame with his longer works such as &quot;Border Town&quot; and &quot;The Long River&quot;. In Beijing Shen Congwen met several influential figures of the New Culture Movement including Ding Ling and her husband Hu Yepin. He lived with the couple for some time before the three writers moved to Shanghai together in 1927.

In Shanghai, Shen, Ding and Hu edited a newspaper literary supplement called &quot;Red and Black&quot; and later &quot;The Human World Monthly&quot;, the literary supplement for the Human World Bookstore in Shanghai. In early 1929 the trio published the first edition of their own literary magazine called the &quot;Red and Black Monthly&quot;. At the time a philosophical battle was begun in the Shanghai literary scene concerning the proper role of writers and art in the forming of new Chinese society. On one side were the communists represented by the Creation Society whose slogan was changed to &quot;Literature is the tool for class struggle!&quot; Rival literary magazine &quot;The Torrent&quot; argued strongly against &quot;proletarian revolutionary literature.&quot; The Crescent Moon Society was decidedly anti-political, and it is with this group that Shen Congwen found his literary philosophy fitted best.

By 1929, Shen, Ding, and Hu&#x27;s publications had all failed while the political situation in Shanghai was increasingly hostile to writers not wholly allied with the Nationalists (KMT). Ding and Hu left for Jinan that year fearing that their political leanings would put them in danger if they stayed in Shanghai. As his two former partners began work at a high school in Jinan, Shen Congwen took a position as instructor of Chinese Literature and writer-in-residence at the Wusong Chinese Institute. Hu Shih president of the school and a founder of the Crescent Moon Society offered him the job, making a special exception for Shen who would normally not have been eligible for the position, lacking any academic degree. Hu Shi appreciated Shen&#x27;s abilities, and Shen also joined the literati circle in Beijing.

In the fall of 1930, Shen moved to Wuchang where he taught a three-hour course at Wuhan University. In the spring of the following year, Shen returned to Hunan following the death of his father. Arriving back at the university in March, was too late for a reappointment and lost his teaching job there. He then taught at Qingdao University (renamed Shandong University in 1932) for two years before returning to Beijing. In 1933, Shen moved to Beijing with his wife, Zhang Zhaohe, and began work on his masterpiece, &quot;Border Town&quot;. The same year, he became the editor for the Art and Literature section of Tianjin&#x27;s &quot;Da Gong Bao&quot;, one of the most influential magazines then.

After the Japanese invasion of 1937, Shen wrote little fiction. That year he fled Beijing, living for four months in Hunan in a city on the Yuan River, before finally fleeing to Kunming following the Japanese bombardment of Wuhan. In Kunming, he taught at National Southwestern Associated University.

The war ended in 1945 and Shen returned to Beijing in the summer of 1946. He taught at Peking University until 1949, when he was removed from his position in a political purge.

Shen Congwen was a particularly apolitical writer. In the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China his resistance to the heavy politicization of the arts lead to him being publicly attacked in big character posters and subsequently to a mental breakdown. In early 1949, Shen drank kerosene and cut his throat and wrist in a suicide attempt. He never published another work of fiction, unable to write stories fitting the political requirements of the new regime.

In 1950, he began work at the Chinese Museum of History in Beijing, labelling artifacts and giving tours. His identity also began to change from a writer to a researcher of cultural relics, the main field is ancient Chinese costumes. During the cultural revolution, his job at the museum became a cleaning position, forcing him to spend his days scrubbing toilets. Shen Congwen was finally politically rehabilitated in 1978. That year, he left the museum for work with the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In this part of his career, after 1950, he published many academic writings on Chinese art history.

In 1956, Shen was hired as a part-time consultant for the Weaving and Embroidery Research Group of the Palace Museum. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution broke out, Shen was regarded as a &quot;reactionary academic authority&quot; and was subjected to criticism.

In 1980–81, Shen travelled to the United States on a study-lecture tour funded by the Chinese government. Despite the trip&#x27;s government backing, he mostly avoided the subject of politics. Zhang Zhaohe&#x27;s sister Zhang Chonghe and brother-in-law Hans Frankel, both of Yale University, provided the financial assistance which permitted Zhang Zhaohe to accompany him on the trip.

On 27 January 1981, after Shen arrived in the Western United States, he was invited to give lectures at three famous universities in the San Francisco Bay Area: Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco State University.

In 1983, Shen Congwen was diagnosed with cerebral thrombosis and his left side was paralyzed. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish sinologist Göran Malmqvist.

Shen Congwen was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Jeffrey Kinkley nominated Shen for the prize first in 1980 after returning from a trip to China where he interviewed the aging writer. He wrote to Swedish sinologist Göran Malmqvist inviting him to join the nomination. Later, in 1988 Malmqvist had become a member of the Swedish Academy and Shen made the list of finalists for the prize. Shen Congwen died later that year, before the prize could be awarded to him. He would have been the first Chinese writer to receive the award.

=== Marriage ===
Shen Congwen and his wife Zhang Zhaohe were married in 1933. In 1929, Shen Congwen was hired by Hu Shi to teach in Shanghai. During this period, his student Zhang Zhaohe (known as &quot;Black Peony&quot;) attracted Shen&#x27;s attention, and he became one of Zhang&#x27;s many suitors. However, Zhang had a poor impression of Shen, and his constant love letters also caused her some inconvenience. Shen&#x27;s persistence finally touched Zhang and her family, and the two married in 1933. After their marriage, conflicts arose between them and they lived apart for a long time. Shen Congwen&#x27;s scandal also caused a rift in their relationship, but they still accompanied each other through their lives. Unfortunately, Shen Congwen was not immune to the political campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s. His apolitical stance brought abuses and taunts that in turn made him depressed, and he moved to a nursing home without Zhang Zhaohe, with whom he maintained a written relationship. Shen Congwen passed away in 1988. It was only when Zhang Zhaohe was sorting out his writings that she realized her lack of understanding of Shen Congwen and understood the hardship he had suffered.

Shen Congwen had two sons and a daughter with Zhang Zhaohe: Shen Longzhu and Shen Huchu and Shen Chaohui.

=== Death ===

Shen died of a heart attack on 10 May 1988 in Beijing at the age of 85. Despite his political rehabilitation several years earlier the state-run media in China was silent upon his death. A one-line obituary was published four days later, calling him a &quot;famous Chinese writer&quot; and failed to mention his political troubles, the resurgence of his work, or the importance of his work in the canon of Chinese literature. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a detailed, paragraphs-long obituary describing him as &quot;a novelist, short-story writer, lyricist and passionate champion of literary and intellectual independence&quot;.

== Works ==
Although almost entirely unknown outside of China, Shen Congwen&#x27;s oeuvre is considered vitally important inside China. His regional fiction with its use of folklore and local character has been compared to that of William Faulkner. He was a very prolific writer, producing more than 20 volumes of prose and fiction between 1933 and 1937. He published more than 200 stories and ten novels among other works. The more than five million characters of his written work are so diverse in both style and genre that Chinese literature scholar and Shen Congwen biographer Jeffrey Kinkley describes his work as a &quot;Chaos of creativity&quot;. His early work includes lyric poems, one-act dramas, essays, and short stories written in a unique and varied style borrowing from regional language, naturalistic spoken dialogue, classical Chinese forms, and Western literary influences. Later, his works included several novels and novellas and eventually, after he stopped writing fiction in 1949, many scholarly, non-fiction volumes about calligraphy, art history, museum preservation and other topics relevant to the history of Chinese art and culture.

Two major thematic focal points of his early writing include military excesses and abuses in the country which he witnessed first-hand and the vanity of the urban bourgeoisie. The later is presented in contrast to his portrayal of the strength of the struggling commoner. &quot;My Education&quot; (), a short personal narrative written in the summer of 1929, is exemplary of Shen&#x27;s many stories about his experiences with the militia. Included in Shen&#x27;s first published collection of writings, the story describes the brutality and monotony that Shen witnessed in Huaihua in 1919 while stationed with an army company there.

Shen Congwen&#x27;s style of creation tends to romanticism, and he demands the poetic effect of the novel, which combines realism and symbolism together. The language is simple with strong local color, which highlights the unique charm and charm of rural human nature. Shen Congwen&#x27;s rural novels are typical rural cultural novels, which are not only in contrast with the urban &quot;modern civilization&quot; on the whole, but also always pay attention to the rural people&#x27;s living mode, life footprint and historical destiny stipulated by different cultural collisions in the process of the western Hunan world&#x27;s transition to modern times.

His works of fiction set in west Hunan have attracted the most critical attention. In these works he focuses on unassimilated Miao people who live in a traditional culture in the frontier region with the dominant Han culture and the modern world. With little first-hand experience of Miao life, Shen based these stories on his own imagination, life experiences and Miao legends told to him by his nursemaid and his country relatives. The descriptive nouns in the novel contain a great deal of western Hunan folk culture and skillfully apply proverbs and folk songs into the novel.

His 1929 short story &quot;Xiaoxiao&quot; (), about the life of a child bride in rural west Hunan was first published in &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;. Shen revised the story in 1935. A film version of the story was made in the 1950s. In 1986 another, more popular film adaptation of the story was released. The film was one of the first mainland Chinese films commercially released in the U.S., where it was published under the title &quot;A Girl from Hunan&quot;. The film was screened in 1987 at the Cannes film festival in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section.

&quot;Long River&quot; (), written during the Sino-Japanese War, is considered the best of his long fiction while &quot;Lamp of Spring&quot; () and &quot;Black Phoenix&quot; () are his most important collections of short stories.

&quot;Border Town&quot; (), published in 1934, is a short novel about the coming of age and romances of an adolescent country girl named Cuicui in a mountain village in western Hunan, near the border with Sichuan province. The love dispute that the story revolves round Cuicui. Two brothers, Tianbao and Tangsong, who were always on the boat at Chatong&#x27; Dock, fell in love with Cuicui at the same time. Cuicui only fell in love with Tansong. Her grandfather only knew that Tianbao had come to ask for a bride, but he did not know what his granddaughter was thinking. The two brothers meet to sing to get Cuicui, Tianbao know to brother also like Cui Cui, change out of the competition but unfortunately encountered an accident. . Shunshun and Tansong misunderstanding Cuicui grandfather, Shunshun looking for another rich marriage to Tansong. But Tansong still fond of Cuicui, he left city of Chatong along the river. Grandfather has been aware of this, depressed in the heart of a thunderstorm died one night, while Cuicui has been waiting for Tansong. A film adaption of the book was released in 1984, winning the Golden Rooster Best Director (Ling Zifeng) award and the Montréal World Film Festival Jury Special Mention the following year.

In addition, Some of Shen&#x27;s works focus on religion. For example, his 1941 novel &quot;The Candle Extinguished&quot; (&quot;Zhu Xu&quot;), is concerned with religiosity: with discovering God in life.

Shen Congwen&#x27;s career as a scholarly writer, beginning after 1949, has received relatively little critical attention, but the works he produced in this period of more than thirty years are still notable because there have been three branches of modern Chinese rural literature: one is the Enlightenment literature represented by Lu Xun; one is the left-wing revolutionary rural literature; another is Shen Congwen&#x27;s beautiful and quiet Xiangxi style literature. Five out the thirty-two volumes of &quot;The Complete Works of Shen Congwen&quot; are devoted to his later scholarly work.

His works were banned in Taiwan and his books were burnt throughout China. By the 1990s, his works started to be re-released and his legacy was restored. In 1995, his wife Zhang Zhaohe published &quot;Family Letters of Congwen&quot;, a collection of 170 of his personal letters sent from 1930 to 1983.

=== Translations ===
As of 2010, his works had been translated into ten languages. Seventy English translations have been made from 44 of his stories. In addition to the stories published in translation in general anthologies of Chinese literature and those published in journals, several anthologies of his work and one monograph have been published in English.

<doc id="478088" wikidata="Q3850637" url="?curid=478088" title="María de Santo Domingo">
<text>Sister María de Santo Domingo, &quot;La Beata de Piedrahita&quot; (&quot;the &quot;holy woman of Piedrahíta&quot;) was a Spanish mystic (c. 1485 – c. 1524) of the early 16th century.

==Life==
María was born in the village of Aldeanueva de Santa Cruz. According to her contemporaries, this peasant visionary, who was the daughter of devout farmers, spent her childhood doing charitable works and spending long hours in prayer.

Piedrahíta, near Ávila, where the Inquisitor General Torquemada had gone to live in the Dominican monastery, was María&#x27;s spiritual home. As a young woman, she became a tertiary sister in the same Dominican order in Piedrahita that had fostered the young Torquemada. Taking the name María de Santo Domingo, Maria was what in Spain at that time was termed a &quot;beata&quot;, that is to say, an unmarried woman who was not a nun, but who quested after holiness by taking vows of chastity and often of poverty. Soon she transferred to Ávila.

María&#x27;s charismatic personality expressed itself in numerous revelations, in which she held celestial converse with the Virgin Mary and the Savior. She informed her contemporaries that Christ was with her, that she &quot;was&quot; Christ , and that she was Christ&#x27;s bride, a concept that offers parallels with her neighbor in Ávila, Saint Teresa of Ávila. Maria often spent hours in ecstatic trances—unmoving, her arms and legs rigidly extended, dissolving herself in the arms of the Deity. Though unlearned she was reputed to be the equal of the most sophisticated theologians, revelations compensating for her lack of schooling. Ávila&#x27;s Dominican Provincial, Diego Magdaleno, sent Maria to Toledo to inspect the Order&#x27;s houses there and initiate ascetic reforms. That administrative order was still shockingly improper to Dominican historian Beltrán in 1939.

The widowed Ferdinand II of Aragon summoned Maria to his court at Burgos. During the season of 1507–08, she impressed the king and his courtiers, including Cardinal Cisneros. However, other contemporaries were confounded and scandalised, denouncing Maria as a self-seeking fraud and labeled her ecstatic behavior &quot;lascivious&quot;. The Dominicans&#x27; new Master General, Thomas Cajetan, suspected the devil rather than God inspired Maria. He restricted her access to the friars of Santo Domingo, who were agitating for ascetic reforms. The Duke of Alba, one of whose palaces faced the monastery at Ávila, took a patron&#x27;s interest in the four trials concerning Maria&#x27;s orthodoxy between 1508 and 1510.

The Duke of Alba, his cousin King Ferdinand and Cardinal Cisneros (who became regent of Castile), convinced the episcopal hierarchy that &quot;La Beata&quot; enjoyed a special inspiration available to very few. Their support proved crucial with respect to the heresy charges. Not only was Maria absolved of the charges, the inquisitors pronounced her life and doctrine exemplary. &quot;La Beata&quot; became prioress in a convent founded especially for her by the Duke of Alba in her native village in central Castile.

Antonio de la Peña and Diego Victoria transcribed Maria&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness &quot;Book of Prayer&quot;, and printed it circa 1518. A copy was discovered in Zaragoza and a facsimile edition republished in Madrid (1948). An English translation appeared in 1992.

The name of &quot;alumbrados&quot; (&quot;illuminati&quot;), says the orthodox &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1907–1914), was assumed by some 16th-century Spanish &quot;false mystics&quot; who claimed — like &quot;La Beata de Piedrahíta&quot; — to have a direct connection with God. &quot;They held that the human soul can reach such a degree of perfection that it contemplates even in the present life the essence of God and comprehends the mystery of the Trinity. All external worship, they declared, is superfluous, the reception of the sacraments useless, and sin impossible in this state of complete union with Him Who is Perfection Itself. Carnal desires may be indulged and other sinful actions committed freely without staining the soul.&quot; The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; specifically states that although &quot;La Beata de Piedrahíta&quot; &quot;is cited among the early adherents of these errors...it is not certain that she was guilty of heresy&quot;. Furthermore, many recent scholars, like Álvaro Huerga, question, on chronological and other grounds, the tendency to consider &quot;La Beata de Piedrahíta&quot; one of the &quot;alumbrados&quot;, placing her rather among the &quot;pre-alumbrados&quot;

&quot;La Beata&quot; was not alone. At Toledo, Isabel de la Cruz actively proselytized, and Magdalena de la Cruz, a Poor Clare of Aguilar, near Córdoba, was even more famous. The Inquisition, however, convinced the latter to abjure her heretical errors in 1546. Their ideas found wide responses among Spanish Catholics, though the Inquisition proceeded with relentless energy against all suspects, citing before its tribunal even St. John of Avila and St. Ignatius of Loyola.

<text>The fallacy of the undistributed middle () is a formal fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed in either the minor premise or the major premise. It is thus a syllogistic fallacy.

==Classical formulation==
In classical syllogisms, all statements consist of two terms and are in the form of &quot;A&quot; (all), &quot;E&quot; (none), &quot;I&quot; (some), or &quot;O&quot; (some not). The first term is distributed in A statements; the second is distributed in O statements; both are distributed in &quot;E&quot; statements, and none are distributed in I statements.

The fallacy of the undistributed middle occurs when the term that links the two premises is never distributed.

In this example, distribution is marked in boldface:

# All Z is B
# All Y is B
# Therefore, all Y is Z

B is the common term between the two premises (the middle term) but is never distributed, so this syllogism is invalid. B would be distributed by introducing a premise which states either All B is Z, or No B is Z.

Also, a related rule of logic is that anything distributed in the conclusion must be distributed in at least one premise.

#All Z is B
#Some Y is Z
#Therefore, all Y is B

The middle term—Z—is distributed, but Y is distributed in the conclusion and not in any premise, so this syllogism is invalid.

== Pattern ==
The fallacy of the undistributed middle takes the following form:
#All Z is B
#Y is B
#Therefore, Y is Z

This may be graphically represented as follows:

where the premises are in the green box and the conclusion is indicated above them.

B is the middle term (because it appears in both premises), and it is not distributed in the major premise, &quot;all Z is B&quot;.

It may or may not be the case that &quot;all Z is B,&quot; but this is irrelevant to the conclusion. What is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that &quot;all B is Z,&quot; which is ignored in the argument. The fallacy is similar to affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent. However, the fallacy may be resolved if the terms are exchanged in either the conclusion or in the first co-premise. Indeed, from the perspective of first-order logic, all cases of the fallacy of the undistributed middle are, in fact, examples of affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent, depending on the structure of the fallacious argument.

== Examples ==
For example:


The middle term is the one that appears in both premises—in this case, it is the class of backpack carriers. It is undistributed because neither of its uses applies to all backpack carriers. Therefore, it cannot be used to connect students and my grandfather—both of them could be separate and unconnected divisions of the class of backpack carriers. Note below how &quot;carries a backpack&quot; is truly undistributed:

:grandfather is someone who carries a backpack; student is someone who carries a backpack

Specifically, the structure of this example results in affirming the consequent.

However, if the latter two statements were switched, the syllogism would be valid:

#&quot;All students carry backpacks.&quot;
#&quot;My grandfather is a student.&quot;
#&quot;Therefore, my grandfather carries a backpack.&quot;

In this case, the middle term is the class of students, and the first use clearly refers to &#x27;all students&#x27;. It is therefore distributed across the whole of its class, and so can be used to connect the other two terms (backpack carriers, and my grandfather). Again, note below that &quot;student&quot; is distributed:

:grandfather is a student and thus carries a backpack

== In popular culture==

The fallacy of the undistributed middle is referenced in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s detective story &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;:

<doc id="478091" wikidata="Q189088" url="?curid=478091" title="Von Neumann architecture">
<text>The von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on the &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, written by John von Neumann in 1945, describing designs discussed with John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering. The document describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer made of &quot;organs&quot; that were later understood to have these components:
* A processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
* A control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter
* Memory that stores data and instructions
* External mass storage
* Input and output mechanisms

The attribution of the invention of the architecture to von Neumann is controversial, not least because Eckert and Mauchly had done a lot of the required design work and claim to have had the idea for stored programs long before discussing the ideas with von Neumann and Herman Goldstine.

The term &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot; has evolved to refer to any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time (since they share a common bus). This is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck, which often limits the performance of the corresponding system.

The von Neumann architecture is simpler than the Harvard architecture (which has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory and another set of address and data buses to fetch instructions).

A stored-program computer uses the same underlying mechanism to encode both program instructions and data as opposed to designs which use a mechanism such as discrete plugboard wiring or fixed control circuitry for instruction implementation. Stored-program computers were an advancement over the manually reconfigured or fixed function computers of the 1940s, such as the Colossus and the ENIAC. These were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units.

The vast majority of modern computers use the same hardware mechanism to encode and store both data and program instructions, but have caches between the CPU and memory, and, for the caches closest to the CPU, have separate caches for instructions and data, so that most instruction and data fetches use separate buses (split-cache architecture).

==History==
The earliest computing machines had fixed programs. Some very simple computers still use this design, either for simplicity or training purposes. For example, a desk calculator (in principle) is a fixed program computer. It can do basic mathematics, but it cannot run a word processor or games. Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires rewiring, restructuring, or redesigning the machine. The earliest computers were not so much &quot;programmed&quot; as &quot;designed&quot; for a particular task. &quot;Reprogramming&quot;—when possible at all—was a laborious process that started with flowcharts and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically rewiring and rebuilding the machine. It could take three weeks to set up and debug a program on ENIAC.

With the proposal of the stored-program computer, this changed. A stored-program computer includes, by design, an instruction set, and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.

A stored-program design also allows for self-modifying code. One early motivation for such a facility was the need for a program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which operators had to do manually in early designs. This became less important when index registers and indirect addressing became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using immediate addressing.

When von Neumann described the automatic computing systems using different terminology than is typically described with the model. In the &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, the architecture was composed of &quot;a high-speed memory M, a central arithmetic unit CA, an outside recording medium R, an input organ I, an output organ O, and a central control CC&quot; 

==Capabilities==
On a large scale, the ability to treat instructions as data is what makes assemblers, compilers, linkers, loaders, and other automated programming tools possible. It makes &quot;programs that write programs&quot; possible. This has made a sophisticated self-hosting computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.

Some high-level languages leverage the von Neumann architecture by providing an abstract, machine-independent way to manipulate executable code at runtime (e.g., LISP), or by using runtime information to tune just-in-time compilation (e.g. languages hosted on the Java virtual machine, or languages embedded in web browsers).

On a smaller scale, some repetitive operations such as BITBLT or pixel and vertex shaders can be accelerated on general purpose processors with just-in-time compilation techniques. This is one use of self-modifying code that has remained popular.

==Development of the stored-program concept==
The mathematician Alan Turing, who had been alerted to a problem of mathematical logic by the lectures of Max Newman at the University of Cambridge, wrote a paper in 1936 entitled &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society&quot;. In it he described a hypothetical machine he called a &quot;universal computing machine&quot;, now known as the &quot;Universal Turing machine&quot;. The hypothetical machine had an infinite store (memory in today&#x27;s terminology) that contained both instructions and data. John von Neumann became acquainted with Turing while he was a visiting professor at Cambridge in 1935, and also during Turing&#x27;s PhD year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey during 1936–1937. Whether he knew of Turing&#x27;s paper of 1936 at that time is not clear.

In 1936, Konrad Zuse also anticipated, in two patent applications, that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.

Independently, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who were developing the ENIAC at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania, wrote about the stored-program concept in December 1943.
 In planning a new machine, EDVAC, Eckert wrote in January 1944 that they would store data and programs in a new addressable memory device, a mercury metal delay-line memory. This was the first time the construction of a practical stored-program machine was proposed. At that time, he and Mauchly were not aware of Turing&#x27;s work.

Von Neumann was involved in the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It required huge amounts of calculation, and thus drew him to the ENIAC project, during the summer of 1944. There he joined the ongoing discussions on the design of this stored-program computer, the EDVAC. As part of that group, he wrote up a description titled &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot; based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly. It was unfinished when his colleague Herman Goldstine circulated it, and bore only von Neumann&#x27;s name (to the consternation of Eckert and Mauchly). The paper was read by dozens of von Neumann&#x27;s colleagues in America and Europe, and influenced the next round of computer designs.

Jack Copeland considers that it is &quot;historically inappropriate to refer to electronic stored-program digital computers as &#x27;von Neumann machines. His Los Alamos colleague Stan Frankel said of von Neumann&#x27;s regard for Turing&#x27;s ideas
At the time that the &quot;First Draft&quot; report was circulated, Turing was producing a report entitled &quot;Proposed Electronic Calculator&quot;. It described in engineering and programming detail, his idea of a machine he called the &quot;Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)&quot;. He presented this to the executive committee of the British National Physical Laboratory on February 19, 1946. Although Turing knew from his wartime experience at Bletchley Park that what he proposed was feasible, the secrecy surrounding Colossus, that was subsequently maintained for several decades, prevented him from saying so. Various successful implementations of the ACE design were produced.

Both von Neumann&#x27;s and Turing&#x27;s papers described stored-program computers, but von Neumann&#x27;s earlier paper achieved greater circulation and the computer architecture it outlined became known as the &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot;. In the 1953 publication &quot;Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines&quot; (edited by B. V. Bowden), a section in the chapter on &quot;Computers in America&quot; reads as follows:

The Machine of the Institute For Advanced Study, Princeton

In 1945, Professor J. von Neumann, who was then working at the Moore School of Engineering in Philadelphia, where the E.N.I.A.C. had been built, issued on behalf of a group of his co-workers, a report on the logical design of digital computers. The report contained a detailed proposal for the design of the machine that has since become known as the E.D.V.A.C. (electronic discrete variable automatic computer). This machine has only recently been completed in America, but the von Neumann report inspired the construction of the E.D.S.A.C. (electronic delay-storage automatic calculator) in Cambridge (see p. 130).

In 1947, Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann published another report that outlined the design of another type of machine (a parallel machine this time) that would be exceedingly fast, capable perhaps of 20,000 operations per second. They pointed out that the outstanding problem in constructing such a machine was the development of suitable memory with instantaneously accessible contents. At first they suggested using a special vacuum tube—called the &quot;Selectron&quot;—which the Princeton Laboratories of RCA had invented. These tubes were expensive and difficult to make, so von Neumann subsequently decided to build a machine based on the Williams memory. This machine—completed in June, 1952 in Princeton—has become popularly known as the Maniac. The design of this machine inspired at least half a dozen machines now being built in America, all known affectionately as &quot;Johniacs&quot;.
In the same book, the first two paragraphs of a chapter on ACE read as follows:

Automatic Computation at the National Physical Laboratory

One of the most modern digital computers which embodies developments and improvements in the technique of automatic electronic computing was recently demonstrated at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where it has been designed and built by a small team of mathematicians and electronics research engineers on the staff of the Laboratory, assisted by a number of production engineers from the English Electric Company, Limited. The equipment so far erected at the Laboratory is only the pilot model of a much larger installation which will be known as the Automatic Computing Engine, but although comparatively small in bulk and containing only about 800 thermionic valves, as can be judged from Plates XII, XIII and XIV, it is an extremely rapid and versatile calculating machine.

The basic concepts and abstract principles of computation by a machine were formulated by Dr. A. M. Turing, F.R.S., in a paper1. read before the London Mathematical Society in 1936, but work on such machines in Britain was delayed by the war. In 1945, however, an examination of the problems was made at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr. J. R. Womersley, then superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the Laboratory. He was joined by Dr. Turing and a small staff of specialists, and, by 1947, the preliminary planning was sufficiently advanced to warrant the establishment of the special group already mentioned. In April, 1948, the latter became the Electronics Section of the Laboratory, under the charge of Mr. F. M. Colebrook.

==Early stored-program computers==
The date information in the following chronology is difficult to put into proper order. Some dates are for first running a test program, some dates are the first time the computer was demonstrated or completed, and some dates are for the first delivery or installation.
* The IBM SSEC had the ability to treat instructions as data, and was publicly demonstrated on January 27, 1948. This ability was claimed in a US patent. However it was partially electromechanical, not fully electronic. In practice, instructions were read from paper tape due to its limited memory.
* The ARC2 developed by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth at Birkbeck, University of London officially came online on May 12, 1948. It featured the first rotating drum storage device.
* The Manchester Baby was the first fully electronic computer to run a stored program. It ran a factoring program for 52 minutes on June 21, 1948, after running a simple division program and a program to show that two numbers were relatively prime.
* The ENIAC was modified to run as a primitive read-only stored-program computer (using the Function Tables for program ROM) and was demonstrated as such on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for von Neumann.
* The BINAC ran some test programs in February, March, and April 1949, although was not completed until September 1949.
* The Manchester Mark 1 developed from the Baby project. An intermediate version of the Mark 1 was available to run programs in April 1949, but was not completed until October 1949.
* The EDSAC ran its first program on May 6, 1949.
* The EDVAC was delivered in August 1949, but it had problems that kept it from being put into regular operation until 1951.
* The CSIR Mk I ran its first program in November 1949.
* The SEAC was demonstrated in April 1950.
* The Pilot ACE ran its first program on May 10, 1950, and was demonstrated in December 1950.
* The SWAC was completed in July 1950.
* The Whirlwind was completed in December 1950 and was in actual use in April 1951.
* The first ERA Atlas (later the commercial ERA 1101/UNIVAC 1101) was installed in December 1950.

==Evolution==
Through the decades of the 1960s and 1970s computers generally became both smaller and faster, which led to evolutions in their architecture. For example, memory-mapped I/O lets input and output devices be treated the same as memory. A single system bus could be used to provide a modular system with lower cost. This is sometimes called a &quot;streamlining&quot; of the architecture.
In subsequent decades, simple microcontrollers would sometimes omit features of the model to lower cost and size.
Larger computers added features for higher performance.

==Design limitations==
===von Neumann bottleneck===
The use of the same bus to fetch instructions and data leads to the &quot;von Neumann bottleneck&quot;, the limited throughput (data transfer rate) between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory compared to the amount of memory. Because the single bus can only access one of the two classes of memory at a time, throughput is lower than the rate at which the CPU can work. This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data. The CPU is continually forced to wait for needed data to move to or from memory. Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.

The von Neumann bottleneck was described by John Backus in his 1977 ACM Turing Award lecture. According to Backus:

Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.

====Mitigations====
There are several known methods for mitigating the Von Neumann performance bottleneck. For example, the following all can improve performance:
* providing a cache between the CPU and the main memory;
* providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called Modified Harvard architecture);
* using branch predictor algorithms and logic;
* providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip scratchpad memory to reduce memory access;
* implementing the CPU and the memory hierarchy as a system on chip, providing greater locality of reference and thus reducing latency and increasing throughput between processor registers and main memory.

The problem can also be sidestepped somewhat by using parallel computing, using for example the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture—this approach is commonly employed by supercomputers. It is less clear whether the &quot;intellectual bottleneck&quot; that Backus criticized has changed much since 1977. Backus&#x27;s proposed solution has not had a major influence. Modern functional programming and object-oriented programming are much less geared towards &quot;pushing vast numbers of words back and forth&quot; than earlier languages like FORTRAN were, but internally, that is still what computers spend much of their time doing, even highly parallel supercomputers.

As of 1996, a database benchmark study found that three out of four CPU cycles were spent waiting for memory. Researchers expect that increasing the number of simultaneous instruction streams with multithreading or single-chip multiprocessing will make this bottleneck even worse. In the context of multi-core processors, additional overhead is required to maintain cache coherence between processors and threads.

===Self-modifying code===
Aside from the von Neumann bottleneck, program modifications can be quite harmful, either by accident or design. In some simple stored-program computer designs, a malfunctioning program can damage itself, other programs, or the operating system, possibly leading to a computer crash. However, this problem also applies to conventional programs that lack bounds checking. Memory protection and various access controls generally safeguard against both accidental and malicious program changes.

<doc id="478094" wikidata="Q2911588" url="?curid=478094" title="Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise">
<text>Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise (illicit negative) is a formal fallacy that is committed when a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion and one or two negative premises.

For example:
:&quot;No fish are dogs, and no dogs can fly, therefore all fish can fly.&quot;

The only thing that can be properly inferred from these premises is that some things that are not fish cannot fly, provided that dogs exist.

Or:
:&quot;We don&#x27;t read that trash. People who read that trash don&#x27;t appreciate real literature. Therefore, we appreciate real literature.&quot;

This could be illustrated mathematically as
:If formula_1 and formula_2 then formula_3.

It is a fallacy because any valid forms of categorical syllogism that assert a negative premise must have a negative conclusion.

==See also==
* Negative conclusion from affirmative premises, in which a syllogism is invalid because the conclusion is negative yet the premises are affirmative
* Fallacy of exclusive premises, in which a syllogism is invalid because both premises are negative

<doc id="478095" wikidata="Q5589802" url="?curid=478095" title="Governors of the Australian states">
<text>Each Australian state has a governor to represent Australia&#x27;s monarch within it. The governors are the nominal chief executives of the states, performing the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the governor-general of Australia at the national or federal level. In practice, with notable exceptions the governors are generally required by convention to act on the advice of the state premiers or the other members of a state&#x27;s cabinet.

Australia&#x27;s state governors are not subject to the constitutional authority of the governor-general, but are direct representatives of the monarch. This means, for example, that the governor-general may not issue pardons or commutations of sentence for any state offences, or issue any state honours.

==Origins==
The office of governor (&quot;governor in chief&quot; was an early title) is the oldest constitutional office in Australia. The title was first used with the Governor of New South Wales, and dates back to 1788 to the day on which the area (which is now the city of Sydney) became the first British settlement in Australia. Each of the subsequent five states in Australia was also founded as a British colony, and a governor was appointed by the British government to exercise executive authority over the colony. The first governors of the colonies, and their dates of appointment, are as follows:

* New South Wales: Captain Arthur Phillip (7 February 1788)
* Western Australia: Captain James Stirling (6 February 1832)
* South Australia: Captain John Hindmarsh (28 December 1836)
* Tasmania: Sir Henry Fox Young (8 January 1855)
* Victoria: Sir Charles Hotham (22 May 1855)
* Queensland: Sir George Bowen (10 December 1859)

Only in New South Wales and South Australia was the date of the appointment of the first governor the actual date of the colony&#x27;s foundation. The settlement which became Queensland was founded in 1824, but was not separated from New South Wales until 1859. In Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia executive authority was exercised by a Lieutenant-Governor for some years before the first Governor was appointed; Tasmania was founded in 1804, Western Australia in 1828 and Victoria in 1835.

New South Wales and Tasmania (which was known as Van Diemen&#x27;s Land until 1855) were founded as penal colonies, and their governors (lieutenant-governors in Tasmania) exercised more or less absolute authority. Tasmania in particular was run as a virtual prison camp in its early years. The Governors were also commanders-in-chief, and the troops under their command were the real basis of their authority.

From the 1820s, however, the increasing number of free settlers in the colonies led to a process of constitutional reform which gradually reduced the powers of the governors. New South Wales was given its first legislative body, the New South Wales Legislative Council, in 1825. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, which were not founded as penal settlements, moved rapidly towards constitutional government after their establishment.

==Federation==
When the six colonies federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, there were some suggestions that the position of state governor should be abolished or that its appointment be made by the Governor-General as is done in Canada. However, the states insisted on retaining their separate links to the Crown, a concept that can be compared to the American system of separate sovereignty for state and federal governments. The states were concerned that Commonwealth-appointed governors might be used to do the federal government&#x27;s bidding, up to and including use of a Governor&#x27;s reserve powers to dismiss a recalcitrant state government. To ensure that state governments would be free from such extra-constitutional intervention or coercion, state governors continued to be appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Colonial Secretary in London, usually after an informal consultation with the state government.

The post of governor was again called into question during the Depression of the 1930s, when the cost of maintaining six vice-regal establishments (as well as a governor-general in Canberra) drew criticism from the labour movement and others. During this period some states (notably Western Australia) left the position unfilled as an economy measure for some years, and the vice-regal functions were filled by the state chief justices with the title of administrator. But no state attempted to abolish the post of governor, and this could not have been done at this time without the consent of the Crown (acting on the advice of the British government).

The political role of the governor became a matter of controversy in 1932 when the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game, used his reserve power to dismiss the premier, Jack Lang, on the grounds that Lang was acting illegally. All governors at this time were British, and most were from the upper classes and political conservatives, and Labor governments always suspected that they had an enemy in Government House. Most governors, however, tried to act impartially, and some were genuinely popular.

From the 1940s the states, particularly those with Labor governments, began to appoint Australians to the post of governor. The first Australian governors of each of the states, and their dates of appointment, were:

* New South Wales: Sir John Northcott (1 August 1946)
* Queensland: Sir John Lavarack (1 October 1946)
* Western Australia: Sir James Mitchell (5 October 1948)
* South Australia: Sir James Harrison (4 December 1968)
* Tasmania: Sir Stanley Burbury (5 December 1973)
* Victoria: Sir Henry Winneke (3 June 1974)

The first colonies were penal settlements and the early colonial governors were military officers who ruled under martial law. Once the governors&#x27; role moved from the executive to the ceremonial, most governors were drawn from the ranks of retired officers. Although a few members of the peerage served as governors (the most prominent being Earl Beauchamp in New South Wales), the Australian colonial capitals were small towns and considered not grand enough to attract senior members of the British aristocracy. Even when Australians replaced Britons as governors, most continued to be retired Army, Navy or Air Force officers until the 1970s.

The last non-Australian governor of an Australian state was Rear Admiral Sir Richard Trowbridge, who was governor of Western Australia from 1980 to 1983. Davis McCaughey, born in Northern Ireland, was not an Australian citizen at the time his appointment as governor of Victoria was announced in 1985, but was a long-time resident of Australia and took up citizenship before commencing his term in 1986.

From the 1960s the governors continued to be appointed by the Monarch of the United Kingdom, acting on the advice of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (who replaced the Colonial Secretary). While usually acting on the recommendation of the state premier, the role of the British government was more than nominal. In 1975 the British government refused to accept premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s request that Sir Colin Hannah&#x27;s term as Queensland governor be extended due to Hannah&#x27;s impartial public comments on the Whitlam government. It was not until 1986, with the passage of the Australia Acts through the state, Australian and British parliaments, that governors became appointed by the Monarch of Australia on the direct advice of the relevant premier.

==The Australia Acts 1986==
Although the Commonwealth of Australia became largely sovereign in external and federal affairs over a period beginning with the Imperial Conference of 1923 and the adoption of the Statute of Westminster in 1942, the states remained colonial dependencies of Britain, subject to the authority of the British government and Imperial Parliament. State laws were still invalid if they conflicted with British laws due to the &quot;Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865&quot;. Additionally, state governors continued to be appointed by the Queen of the United Kingdom (not the legally distinct Queen of Australia) on the advice of the British Foreign Secretary. Generally, the premier of each state recommended a prospective governor to the foreign secretary, who almost always acted in accordance with that recommendation. However, in 1976 the Foreign Secretary refused to advise the Queen to extend extend the term of Sir Colin Hannah as governor, as recommended by Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, on the grounds of the governor&#x27;s partisan comments on the federal Whitlam government.

In 1978, the Parliament of New South Wales passed the &quot;Constitutional Powers (New South Wales) Act&quot;, requesting that the Commonwealth Parliament legislate to address the constitutional anomaly of the United Kingdom Government&#x27;s role in the constitutional affairs of the state. Eventually, identical Australia Acts were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1986, thus removing what remaining authority London had over affairs in Canberra. Under section 7 of these Acts, the King now receives advice on the appointment and termination of appointments of state governors from the relevant state premier.

==Role of the governors==

The role of state governor in modern times is broken down into constitutional, ceremonial and social responsibilities. Regarding constitutional practices, in most cases the governor observes the convention to act on the advice of the state&#x27;s cabinet (and/or premier). Nevertheless, the state governors, like the governor-general, retain the full panoply of the reserve powers of the Crown. This has been shown on two recent occasions.

In 1987 the Governor of Queensland, Sir Walter Campbell, refused to accept the advice of the National Party premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, to dismiss five of his ministers and call fresh elections. Campbell believed that Bjelke-Petersen had lost the confidence of his own party and was behaving irrationally. He was also reluctant to call an election for a legislature that was barely a year old, and felt that the situation was a political rather than a constitutional matter. Bjelke-Petersen subsequently resigned.

In 1989 the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Phillip Bennett, refused to grant a fresh dissolution to the Liberal premier, Robin Gray, after Gray lost his majority in the recent election. Although no one party had a majority in the new House of Assembly, Bennett had already been assured that the Tasmanian Greens would support a minority Labor government under Michael Field. Bennett thus took the view that Gray no longer had enough support to govern and could not advise him to call a second election. Gray then resigned; Bennett then commissioned Field as premier.

In the event of a Governor-General&#x27;s death, incapacity, removal, resignation or absence overseas, each of the state governors has a dormant commission to become the Administrator of the Commonwealth, that is, to take on the Governor-General&#x27;s duties until he returns from overseas or a new appointment is made. The convention has been that the longest-serving state governor is appointed administrator. When Peter Hollingworth resigned in May 2003, Sir Guy Green, Governor of Tasmania, took on that role, serving until Major-General Michael Jeffery took office in August 2003.

==Lieutenant-governors and administrators==
A lieutenant-governor takes on the responsibilities of a governor when that post is vacant or when the governor is out of the state or unable to act. In some states the lieutenant governor is also the chief justice. An administrator takes on those duties if both the governor and lieutenant-governor are not able to act for the above reasons.

==Backgrounds of governors==
In 1976, South Australia appointed Sir Douglas Nicholls as the first (and, to date, the only) Aboriginal governor of an Australian state. Governors of non-Anglo-Australian background have been appointed in recent years. These include Ken Michael (Greek; Western Australia), Sir James Gobbo (Italian; Victoria), David de Kretser (Sri Lankan/Ceylonese; Victoria), Dame Marie Bashir (Lebanese; New South Wales), Alex Chernov (Russian: Victoria), and Hieu Van Le (Vietnamese; South Australia). Sir Matthew Nathan, Governor of Queensland from 1920 to 1925, was Australia&#x27;s only Jewish governor until the appointment of Linda Dessau as Governor of Victoria in 2015.

South Australia was also the first state to appoint a woman as governor, when Dame Roma Mitchell took office in 1991. With the appointment of Jeannette Young on 1 November 2021, Queensland currently has four female governors, more than any other state. Queensland is also the first state to have had two female governors in succession (Penelope Wensley succeeded Quentin Bryce), followed by Tasmania (Kate Warner in 2014 and Barbara Baker in 2021) and then Victoria in 2023. South Australia now has three female governors following the appointment of Frances Adamson who was sworn in on 7 October 2021. With the appointment of Margaret Gardner who was sworn in on 9 August 2023; New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria will have had two each whilst Western Australia has only one so far. The Northern Territory, the only mainland territory to have an administrator, has had two female administrators (Sally Thomas and Vicki O&#x27;Halloran). Since 2021, every state Governor apart from that of Western Australia has been a woman.

John Landy, a former governor of Victoria, and Marjorie Jackson-Nelson, a former governor of South Australia, are former Australian Olympic medallists.

==Contemporary changes and prospects==
The Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978 under its own administrator appointed by the governor-general. The Commonwealth prime minister, not the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator.

In the lead up to the 1999 republican referendum, state governments were required to consider state links to the Crown and thus the validity of appointing the governor through the Queen. At a constitutional convention in Gladstone, Queensland, the states indicated that, if the referendum was successful, governors should be appointed by the parliament, although agreement on the exact method of appointment was not reached. As the referendum failed, no state altered the appointment method.

<doc id="478097" wikidata="Q4175604" url="?curid=478097" title="Allocative efficiency">
<text>Allocative efficiency is a state of the economy in which production is aligned with the preferences of consumers and producers; in particular, the set of outputs is chosen so as to maximize the social welfare of society. This is achieved if every produced good or service has a marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost of production.

== Description ==

In economics, allocative efficiency entails production at the point on the production possibilities frontier that is optimal for society. 

In contract theory, allocative efficiency is achieved in a contract in which the skill demanded by the offering party and the skill of the agreeing party are the same. 

Resource allocation efficiency includes two aspects:
# At the macro aspect, it is the allocation efficiency of social resources, which is achieved through the economic system arrangements of the entire society.
# The micro aspect is the efficient use of resources, which can be understood as the production efficiency of the organization, which can be improved through innovation and progress within the organizations.

Although there are different standards of evaluation for the concept of allocative efficiency, the basic principle asserts that in any economic system, choices in resource allocation produce both &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; relative to the choice being evaluated. The principles of rational choice, individual maximization, utilitarianism and market theory further suppose that the outcomes for winners and losers can be identified, compared, and measured. Under these basic premises, the goal of attaining allocative efficiency can be defined according to some principles where some allocations are subjectively better than others. For example, an economist might say that a policy change is an allocative improvement as long as those who benefit from the change (winners) gain more than the losers lose (see Kaldor–Hicks efficiency).

An allocatively efficient economy produces an &quot;optimal mix&quot; of commodities. A firm is allocatively efficient when its price is equal to its marginal costs (that is, P = MC) in a perfect market. The demand curve coincides with the marginal utility curve, which measures the (private) benefit of the additional unit, while the supply curve coincides with the marginal cost curve, which measures the (private) cost of the additional unit. In a perfect market, there are no externalities, implying that the demand curve is also equal to the social benefit of the additional unit, while the supply curve measures the social cost of the additional unit. Therefore, the market equilibrium, where demand meets supply, is also where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social costs. At this point, the net social benefit is maximized, meaning this is the allocative efficient outcome. When a market fails to allocate resources efficiently, there is said to be market failure. Market failure may occur because of imperfect knowledge, differentiated goods, concentrated market power (e.g., monopoly or oligopoly), or externalities.

In the single-price model, at the point of allocative efficiency price is equal to marginal cost. At this point the social surplus is maximized with no deadweight loss (the latter being the value society puts on that level of output produced minus the value of resources used to achieve that level). Allocative efficiency is the main tool of welfare analysis to measure the impact of markets and public policy upon society and subgroups being made better or worse off.

It is possible to have Pareto efficiency without allocative efficiency: in such a situation, it is impossible to reallocate resources in such a way that someone gains and no one loses (hence we have Pareto efficiency), yet it would be possible to reallocate in such a way that gainers gain more than losers lose (hence with such a reallocation, we do not have allocative efficiency).

Also, for an extensive discussion of various types of allocative efficiency in a production context and their estimations see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, Chapter 3, etc).
In view of the Pareto efficiency measurement method, it is difficult to use in actual operation, including the use of human and material resources, which is hard to achieve a full range of efficiency allocation, and it is mainly to make judgments from the allocation of funds; therefore, analyzing the funds in the stock market. Allocation efficiency is used to determine the efficiency of resource allocation in the capital market.

In a perfectly competitive market, capital market resources should be allocated among capital markets under the principle of the highest marginal benefit. Therefore, the most important measurement standard in the capital market is to observe whether capital flows into the enterprise with the best operating efficiency. The most efficient companies should also get a large amount of capital investment, and the less efficient companies should get less capital investment.
There are three conditions that come with Pareto efficiency
; Best trade outcome
: Even if you trade again, individuals cannot get greater benefits from it. At this time, for any two consumers, the marginal substitution rate of any two commodities is the same, and the utility of the two consumers is maximized at the same time.
; Optimal production:
: This economy must be on the boundary of its own production possibilities. At this time, for any two producers who produce different products, the marginal technology substitution rate of the two production factors that need to be input is the same, and the output of the two consumers is maximized at the same time.
; Optimal product mix:
: The combination of products produced by the economy must reflect consumer preferences. At this time, the marginal rate of substitution between any two commodities must be the same as the marginal product conversion rate of any producer between these two commodities.

== Examples ==
=== A numerical example of allocative efficiency ===

Allocation efficiency occurs when there is an optimal distribution of goods and services, considering consumer&#x27;s preference. When the price equals marginal cost of production, the allocation efficiency is at the output level. This is because the optimal distribution is achieved when the marginal utility of good equals the marginal cost. The price that consumer is willing to pay is same as the marginal utility of the consumer.

From the graph we can see that at the output of 40, the marginal cost of good is $6 while the price that consumer is willing to pay is $15. It means the marginal utility of the consumer is higher than the marginal cost. The optimal level of the output is 70, where the marginal cost equals to marginal utility. At the output of 40, this product or service is under-consumed by the society. By increasing the output to 70, the price will fall to $11. Meanwhile, the society would benefit from consuming more of the good or service. 

=== An example of allocation inefficiency ===

With the market power, the monopoly can increase the price to gain the super normal profit. The monopolies can set the price above the marginal cost of the production. In this case, the allocation is not efficient. It results in the dead weight welfare loss to the society as a whole. In real life, the government&#x27;s intervention policy to monopoly enterprises will affect the allocation efficiency. Large-scale downstream companies with more efficient or better products are generally more competitive than other companies. The wholesale prices they get are much lower than those of their competitors. It is conducive to improving the efficiency of allocation. Ind erst and Shaffer (2009) found that banning prices would reduce allocation efficiency and lead to higher wholesale prices for all enterprises. More importantly, social welfare, industry profits, and consumer surplus will all be reduced.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-96 () is a Russian four-engined jet long-haul wide-body airliner designed by Ilyushin in the former Soviet Union and manufactured by the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association in Russia. It is powered by four high-bypass Aviadvigatel PS-90 two-shaft turbofan engines. As of 2024, the Il-96 is used as the main Russian presidential aircraft. The type&#x27;s only remaining commercial operator in passenger service is Cubana de Aviación while Sky Gates Airlines operates a single cargo variant.

== Development ==
===Foundations===
Despite its usefulness on domestic routes in the Soviet Union, the serviceable but ultimately disappointing performance of the Il-86, especially in regards to range caused Ilyushin to begin planning to produce the long range Il-86D variant and the design was completed in 1976. The main changes from the base Il-86 included slightly longer wings and increased fuel capacity. The Il-86D project was eventually cancelled, but it laid the foundation for the Il-96, and the new design has a strong resemblance to the older Il-86. The new Il-96 featured larger wings, a shorter fuselage, new modern avionics and systems, and, perhaps most important, the new PS-90A high-bypass turbofan, which greatly decreased fuel consumption and increased overall performance. The prototype was first flown 20 September 1988 and the aircraft was certified in 1992. Aeroflot began passenger service in 1993. 

===Development since the 2000s===
In June 2005, the Volga-Dnepr Group signed a 15-year financial agreement with Ilyushin Finance Corporation (IFC) to take delivery of two new-build Il-96-400T aircraft, to be operated by Volga-Dnepr&#x27;s subsidiary AirBridge Cargo. The first was due to have been delivered in late 2006. The Cuban Government newspaper &quot;Granma&quot; announced on 3 January 2006 the first official flight of the Cubana Il-96-300, from Havana to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

On 11 August 2009 Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Khristenko announced that manufacturing of the Il-96-300 would cease. In particular, the Il-96-300 had been deemed inferior to counterparts from Boeing and Airbus, and the manufacturer could not arrange commercially viable mass production, making only one aircraft per year. The Il-96-400T cargo version was to remain in production.

On 9 October 2015, it was announced that an updated version of the Il-96 may be produced. This decision was taken due to the current diplomatic situation between Russia and the West, and the dependency of the Russian aerospace industry on Airbus and Boeing. In September 2017, the Vice President of Russia&#x27;s United Aircraft Corporation Aleksandr Tulyakov announced the start of development of the 250–280 seat, wide-body long-haul aircraft in partnership with Chinese builders. The aircraft is to be a development of the Russian-designed IL-96 and will be assembled in China. A new engineering center will be built in Russia to undertake technical and electronics production. , Ilyushin also had been studying a new variant of airliner based on Il-96, powered by two Aviadvigatel PD-35s rated at , developed by 2025 from the PD-14, or powered by foreign powerplants. The goal would be to reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs.

In March 2022, after International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War, the CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov announced a large scale production relaunch of the Il-96.

== Design ==

The Ilyushin Il-96 is a shortened, long-range, and advanced technology development of the Soviet Union&#x27;s first widebody airliner, the Ilyushin Il-86. It features supercritical wings fitted with winglets, a glass cockpit, and a fly-by-wire control system. The basic Il-96-300 is equipped with modern Russian avionics integrating six multi-function colour LCD displays, inertial and satellite navigation systems, and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (including mode &quot;S&quot;). It allows the airplane to be operated with two crew members. The avionics correspond to modern requirements on international routes in Europe and North America (RNP-1) and allow navigation and landing under ICAO CAT III/A conditions. The Il-96 is offered in three main variants: the Il-96-300, Il-96M/T and Il-96-400.

The Il-96-300 has a standard passenger capacity of 262 seats in a two-class configuration with 18 seats with a seat pitch of and 244 seats with a pitch of , of which typical seating is 3–3–3 (layout), but low density seating is possible with 2–4–2 (layout). Galleys are positioned on the upper deck, and the lower deck can accommodate 18 LD-3 containers and crew rest areas.

== Avionics ==
The airplane has the following systems installed, providing compliance with ICAO recommendations and Eurocontrol requirements:
* Integrated communication and navigation control panel and flight management system
* Upgraded EFIS with LCD indicators
* Inertial navigation system
* Ground proximity warning system
* TCAS
* SELCAL
* Weather radar
* Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System with satellite communication.
* Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder

== Variants ==
There are two variants of the Il-96. The Il-96-300 was launched in 1985 with introduction into service in 1993. The Il-96M was launched in 1993 with introduction into service in 2000.

=== Il-96-300 ===

The Il-96-300 is the initial variant and is fitted with Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) PS-90A turbofans with a thrust rating of 16,000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf). Development started in the mid-80s while the first prototype flew on 28 September 1988. The first Il-96 entered service with Aeroflot in 1993. Range with 262 passengers and fuel reserves (for holding 75 minutes at an altitude of 450 m) in a two-class configuration is about 11,000 km (5,940 nmi), allowing flights from Moscow to US west coast cities, a great improvement over the Ilyushin Il-86.

====Il-96-300PU====

A highly customized version of the Il-96-300, called the Il-96-300PU, is used as the primary aircraft in the Russian presidential aircraft fleet. Four were used by Russian president Vladimir Putin, and by Dmitry Medvedev as VIP planes. The VIP aircraft is operated by Russia State Transport Company. The Cuban leadership uses the IL-96-300.

====Il-96-300V====
There were plans to produce a variant dubbed Il-96-300V which would include two sets of airstairs in it.

=== Il-96M ===
The Il-96M is a stretched variant of the Il-96-300. It features a 10 m (30 ft) fuselage stretch, is 15 tonnes (33,000 lb) heavier, is fitted with Western-style avionics, and is powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2337 engines with a thrust rating of 165 kN (37,000 lbf). Range with 312 passengers in a three-class configuration or 92 tonne (203,000 lb) payload is about 10,400 km (5,600 nmi). This turned it into a true—but vastly more capable—Il-86 successor. Development on the M/T variant stalled when the US Export–Import Bank suspended talks on financing the engines and avionics, following pressure from Boeing. The dispute was later settled following an Aeroflot order for ten Boeing 737-400s—placed in April 1997 in a deal worth US$440 million that were granted a tax exemption by the Russian government. Nevertheless, the financing was blocked again when four Boeing 767-300ERs also ordered by Aeroflot were not included in the accorded exemption. The deal was never realised.

=== Il-96-400T ===
This is the freighter version of the Il-96-400. It is powered by four Aviadvigatel PS-90A1 engines. Only a handful of Il-96-400T aircraft were built and most of them were in storage until recently. Sanctions on Russia by Boeing and Airbus have changed the situation though and in December 2023, Sky Gates who are owned by Red Wings leased an IL-96-400T and started using it to carry cargo to and from Russia. The plane received an overhaul prior to being leased in order to make sure it met air worthiness standards. Russian media suggest a second Il-96-400T is currently being overhauled and it too will be leased to Sky Gates in early 2024, once the overhaul is complete.

=== Il-96-400 ===

The Il-96-400 is similar to the Il-96M, but features Russian avionics and engines. It is powered by four Aviadvigatel PS-90A1 turbofans and can carry up to 436 passengers. Typical two-class configuration will have 386 passengers. Range with 315 passengers in a three-class configuration is about 10,000 km. A special version, dubbed Il-96-400VT, was reported on Friday 19 March 2010 by the Wall Street Journal to bid on the US$40 billion Air Force Tanker Program contract. In February 2013, Cubana signed a deal for the order of three 350-seater Ilyushin Il-96-400s.

==== Il-96-400VPU ====
One modified Il-96-400, the Il-96-400VPU is being converted to serve as an Airborne Command Post by the Russian Aerospace Forces as part of &quot;Project Zveno-3S&quot; calling for two such aircraft to enter service to replace the current Il-80-based planes.

==== Il-96-400M ====

In February 2017, it was announced that Russia&#x27;s United Aircraft Corporation had signed a contract with its subsidiary Ilyushin Aviation Complex for the development of a new version of Ilyushin Il-96-400 wide-body passenger airliner to compete with the Boeing 777-9 and Airbus A350-1000. Il-96-400M is the passenger version of the Il-96-400T cargo aircraft. Its fuselage is 9.65 m longer than the existing Il-96-300 passenger variant. The new interior planned seating capacity is 390 passengers.
In 2017, the Russian Government injected ₽3.6 billion ($ million) into the Ilyushin Il-96-400M.

By January 2020, the first test-flight airframe was in final assembly and the wing and fuselage were joined, to be finished at the end of 2020 before a first flight in 2021, but by April 2021 it was announced that the aircraft will not enter mass production as expected because of &quot;lack of interest from the airlines and the worldwide idling of the long-range fleet due to the pandemic&quot;. Still, due to sanctions, on 15 August 2022, it was announced that the first flight of the Il-96-400M was planned. On 7 June 2023, the United Aircraft Corporation rolled out Russia&#x27;s future wide-body passenger airliner. It made its first flight on 1 November 2023.

==== Il-96-400TZ ====
In January 2015, a new tanker variant of the Il-96, designated the Il-96-400TZ (Russian: &quot;ТЗ&quot; for &quot;топливозаправщик&quot; – fuel replenisher), was proposed, with an initial order for two aircraft placed by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The new tanker would have been able to transfer more than 65 tons (IL-78M 40 tons) of fuel at a distance of up to 3500 km (Il-78M 3000 km). Universal aviation refueling systems ORM-1, proven on existing combat aircraft tankers Il-78/78М, would have been installed on the aircraft. According to Alexei Krivoruchko, Russian Deputy Minister of Defense, factory trials of the Il-96-400TZ are expected to be completed in May, 2020. However this is previously cancelled due to differences between Russian MoD and Ilyushin, and in favor of much proven Il-76MD-90A platform, which is the Il-78M-90A.

=== Il-96-500T ===
Projected freighter version of Il-96 with an enlarged fuselage to transport oversize cargo.

=== Il-96-550 ===
Projected double-deck version of Il-96 for 550–600 passengers and powered by Kuznetsov NK-93 propfan engines. Following flight tests in 2007 the engines were removed and the aircraft was not developed further.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
As of December 2023, current operators of the Ilyushin Il-96 are:

===Production by year===
The following sheet lists the number of finished aircraft per year since the start of its production:
==Accidents and incidents==
In the entire history of operation with the Il-96, there have been no accidents causing the deaths of passengers or crew.

* In 2005, Russia indefinitely grounded Ilyushin Il-96-300 passenger aircraft after transport inspectors pointed out malfunctions in the jets’ braking systems. The decision came just weeks after a technical glitch in an Il-96-300 forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to fly in a back-up plane during a visit to Finland.

* On 3 June 2014, RA-96010 of Aeroflot, which had been retired from service, was damaged beyond economical repair in a fire while parked in storage at Sheremetyevo International Airport, Moscow.

<doc id="478114" wikidata="Q665566" url="?curid=478114" title="Aloha Airlines Flight 243">
<text>Aloha Airlines Flight 243 (IATA: AQ243, ICAO: AAH243) was a scheduled Aloha Airlines flight between Hilo and Honolulu in Hawaii. On April 28, 1988, a Boeing 737-297 serving the flight suffered extensive damage after an explosive decompression in flight, caused by part of the fuselage breaking due to poor maintenance and metal fatigue. The plane was able to land safely at Kahului Airport on Maui. The one fatality, flight attendant Clarabelle &quot;C.B.&quot; Lansing, was ejected from the airplane. Sixty-five passengers and crew were injured. The substantial damage inflicted by the decompression, the loss of one cabin crew member, and the safe landing of the aircraft established the accident as a significant event in the history of aviation, with far-reaching effects on aviation safety policies and procedures.

== Background ==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved, manufactured in 1969, was a Boeing 737-297 registered as N73711. Prior to the accident, the aircraft had accumulated 35,496 flight hours, those hours in 89,680 flight cycles (takeoffs and landings), owing to its use on short flights. This amounted to more than twice the number of flight cycles for which it was designed. At the time of the accident, Aloha Airlines operated the two highest flight-cycle Boeing 737s in the world, with the accident aircraft being number two.

=== Crew ===
In command was 44-year-old Captain Robert Schornstheimer, an experienced pilot with 8,500 flight hours, 6,700 of which were in Boeing 737s. The first officer was 36-year-old Madeline &quot;Mimi&quot; Tompkins, who also had significant experience flying the 737, having logged 3,500 of her total 8,000 flight hours in that particular Boeing model.

==Accident==
Flight 243 departed from Hilo International Airport at 13:25 HST on April 28, 1988, with 5 crew members and 90 passengers on board, bound for Honolulu. Nothing unusual was noted during the pre-departure inspection of the aircraft, which had already completed three round-trip flights from Honolulu to Hilo, Maui, and Kauai earlier that day, all uneventful. Meteorological conditions were checked, but no advisories for weather phenomena were reported along the air route, per AIRMETs or SIGMETs.

After a routine takeoff and ascent, the aircraft had reached its normal flight altitude of , when at around 13:48, about south-southeast of Kahului on the island of Maui, a section on the left side of the roof ruptured with a &quot;whooshing&quot; sound. The captain felt the aircraft roll to the left and right, and the controls went loose; the first officer noticed pieces of grey insulation floating in the cockpit. The cockpit door had broken away and the captain could see &quot;blue sky where the first-class ceiling had been.&quot; A large section of the roof had torn off, consisting of the entire top half of the aircraft skin extending from just behind the cockpit to the fore-wing area, a length of about .
The only fatality was that of 58-year-old flight attendant Clarabelle &quot;C.B.&quot; Lansing, who was swept out of the airplane while standing near the fifth-row seats; her body was never found. Lansing was a veteran flight attendant of 37 years at the time of the accident. Eight other people suffered serious injuries. All of the passengers had been seated and wearing their seat belts during the depressurization.

First Officer Tompkins was the pilot flying at the time of the accident; Captain Schornstheimer took over controls and performed an immediate emergency descent. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Kahului Airport for an emergency landing. During the approach to the airport, the left engine failed, and the flight crew was unsure if the nose gear was lowered correctly. Nevertheless, they were able to land normally on Runway 2, thirteen minutes after the accident. Upon landing, the aircraft&#x27;s emergency evacuation slides were deployed and passengers quickly evacuated from the aircraft. Sixty-five people were reported injured, eight of them with serious injuries. At the time, Maui had no plan in place for an emergency of this type. The injured were taken to the hospital in tour vans belonging to Akamai Tours, driven by office personnel and mechanics, as the island only had two ambulances. Air traffic control radioed Akamai and requested as many of their 15-passenger vans as they could spare to go to the airport (which was from their base) to transport the injured. Two of the Akamai drivers were former paramedics and established a triage on the runway.

==Aftermath==
Additional damage to the airplane included damaged and dented horizontal stabilizers, both of which had been struck by flying debris. Some of the metal debris had also struck the aircraft&#x27;s vertical stabilizer, causing slight damage. The leading edges of both wings and both engine cowlings had also sustained damage. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, dismantled on site and written off.

The piece of the fuselage blown off the aircraft was never found. Investigation by the U. S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue exacerbated by crevice corrosion. The aircraft was 19 years old and operated in a coastal environment, with exposure to salt and humidity.

During an interview, passenger Gayle Yamamoto told investigators that she had noticed a crack in the fuselage upon boarding, but did not notify anyone.

In 1995, a garden in Terminal 1 of Honolulu International Airport was named in honor of flight attendant Lansing.

== Construction ==
The accident aircraft was line number 152. All 737s constructed after line number 291 included an additional outer layer of skin or doubler sheet at the lap joint of the fuselage. This doubler sheet was not used in the construction of the accident aircraft. In the case of production line 292 and after, this doubler sheet gave an additional thickness of at the lap joint. For airplane line number 291 and before, cold bonding had been used, with fasteners used to maintain surface contact in the joint, allowing bonding adhesive to transfer load within the joint. This cold-bonded joint used an epoxy-impregnated woven scrim cloth to join the edges of skin panels. These epoxy cloths were reactive at room temperature, so they were stored at dry ice temperatures until used in manufacture. The bond cured at room temperature after assembly. The cold-bonding process reduced the overall weight and manufacturing cost. Fuselage hoop loads (circumferential loads within the skins due to pressurization of the cabin) were intended to be transferred through the bonded joint, rather than through the rivets, allowing the use of lighter, thinner fuselage skin panels with no degradation in fatigue life.

The additional outer layer construction improved the joint by:
*Eliminating the knife-edge fatigue detail, which resulted from the countersinking of the panels for flush rivets in a disbonded upper skin, and
*Eliminating the corrosion concern associated with the scrim cloth, which could wick moisture into the lap joint

== Conclusion ==

The NTSB investigation determined that the quality of inspection and maintenance programs was deficient. Fuselage examinations were scheduled during the night, which made carrying out an adequate inspection of the aircraft&#x27;s outer skin more difficult.

Also, the fuselage failure initiated in the lap joint along S-10L; the failure mechanism was a result of multiple-site fatigue cracking of the skin adjacent to rivet holes along the lap joint upper rivet row and tear strap disbond, which negated the fail-safe characteristics of the fuselage. Finally, the fatigue cracking initiated from the knife edge associated with the countersunk lap joint rivet holes; the knife edge concentrated stresses that were transferred through the rivets because of lap joint disbonding.

The NTSB concluded in its final report on the accident:

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the Aloha Airlines maintenance program to detect the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage which ultimately led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing to the accident were the failure of Aloha Airlines management to supervise properly its maintenance force; the failure of the FAA to require Airworthiness Directive 87-21-08 inspection of all the lap joints proposed by Boeing Alert Service Bulletin SB 737-53A1039; and the lack of a complete terminating action (neither generated by Boeing nor required by the FAA) after the discovery of early production difficulties in the B-737 cold-bond lap joint, which resulted in low bond durability, corrosion, and premature fatigue cracking.

One board member dissented, arguing that the fatigue cracking was clearly the probable cause, but that Aloha Airlines maintenance should not be singled out because failures by the FAA, Boeing, and Aloha Airlines maintenance each were contributing factors to the disaster.

<text>The New Zealand national cricket team represents New Zealand in men&#x27;s international cricket. Nicknamed the Black Caps (), they played their first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, becoming the fifth country to play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956, more than 26 years, for its first Test victory, against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland. They played their first ODI in the 1972–73 season against Pakistan in Christchurch. New Zealand are the inaugural champions of WTC which they won in 2021 and they have also won ICC CT in 2000. They have played in the CWC final twice and the T20 WC final once.

Tom Latham is the current captain of the team in Test cricket and Mitchell Santner is the current captain of the team in ODI and T20I cricket. The national team is organised by New Zealand Cricket.

The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Black Caps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team. This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks.

As of 21 September 2023, New Zealand have played 1472 international matches, out of which they have won 584, lost 654, tied 17 and drew 170 matches while 47 matches ended up as no result.
The team is ranked 5th in Tests, 5th in ODIs and 4th in T20Is by the ICC.

As of 2022, the team has participated in all the 29 ICC Men&#x27;s events taking place from 1975 onwards and have made six final appearances out of which they won two titles. In October 2000 they won the Knockout Trophy by defeating India which was their maiden ICC Title. They defeated South Africa to reach their maiden CWC Final in 2015. In the next edition they reached their second successive Final by defeating India. Then in June 2021 they won the inaugural WTC by defeating India and five months later they reached their maiden T20 WC Final by defeating England.

==History==

===Beginnings of cricket in New Zealand===

The reverend Henry Williams provided history with the first report of a game of cricket in New Zealand, when he wrote in his diary in December 1832 about boys in and around Paihia on Horotutu Beach playing cricket. In 1835, Charles Darwin and called into the Bay of Islands on its epic circumnavigation of the Earth and Darwin witnessed a game of cricket played by freed Māori slaves and the son of a missionary at Waimate North. Darwin in &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot; wrote:
several young men redeemed by the missionaries from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket.
The first recorded game of cricket in New Zealand took place in Wellington in December 1842. The &quot;Wellington Spectator&quot; reports a game on 28 December 1842 played by a &quot;Red&quot; team and a &quot;Blue&quot; team from the Wellington Club. The first fully recorded match was reported by the &quot;Examiner&quot; in Nelson between the Surveyors and Nelson in March 1844.

The first team to tour New Zealand was Parr&#x27;s all England XI in 1863–64. Between 1864 and 1914, 22 foreign teams toured New Zealand. England sent 6 teams, Australia 15 and one from Fiji.

===First national team===

On 15–17 February 1894 the first team representing New Zealand played New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. New South Wales won by 160 runs. New South Wales returned again in 1895–96 and New Zealand won the solitary game by 142 runs, its first victory. The New Zealand Cricket Council was formed towards the end of 1894.

New Zealand played its first two internationals (not Tests) in 1904–05 against a star-studded Australia team containing such players as Victor Trumper, Warwick Armstrong and Clem Hill. Rain saved New Zealand from a thrashing in the first match, but not the second, which New Zealand lost by an innings and 358 runs – currently the second-largest defeat in New Zealand first-class history.

===Inter-war period===

In 1927 NZ toured England. They played 26 first-class matches, mostly against county sides. They won seven matches, including those against Worcestershire, Glamorgan, Somerset and Derbyshire. On the strength of the performances of this tour New Zealand was granted Test status.

In 1929/30 the M.C.C toured NZ and played 4 Tests all of 3 days in duration. New Zealand lost its first Test match but drew the next 3. In the second Test Stewie Dempster and Jackie Mills put on 276 for the first wicket. This is still the highest partnership for New Zealand against England. New Zealand first played South Africa in 1931–32 in a three match series but were unable to secure Test matches against any teams other than England before World War II ended all Test cricket for 7 years. A Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the war.

===After World War II===

New Zealand&#x27;s first Test after the war was against Australia in 1945/46. This game was not considered a &quot;Test&quot; at the time but it was granted Test status retrospectively by the International Cricket Council in March 1948. The New Zealand players who appeared in this match probably did not appreciate this move by the ICC as New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54. The New Zealand Cricket Council&#x27;s unwillingness to pay Australian players a decent allowance to tour New Zealand ensured that this was the only Test Australia played against New Zealand between 1929 and 1972.

In 1949 New Zealand sent one of its best-ever sides to England. It contained Bert Sutcliffe, Martin Donnelly, John R. Reid and Jack Cowie. However, 3-day Test matches ensured that all 4 Tests were drawn. Many have regarded the 1949 tour of England among New Zealand&#x27;s best ever touring performances. All four tests were high-scoring despite being draws and Martin Donnelly&#x27;s 206 at Lord&#x27;s hailed as one of the finest innings ever seen there. Despite being winless, New Zealand did not lose a test either. Prior to this, only the legendary 1948 Australian team, led by the great Don Bradman, had achieved this.

New Zealand played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951–52, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56.

In 1954/55 New Zealand recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years to attain.

In the next 20 years, New Zealand won only seven more Tests. For most of this period New Zealand lacked a class bowler to lead their attack although they had two excellent batsmen in Bert Sutcliffe and Glenn Turner and a great all-rounder in John R. Reid.

Reid captained New Zealand on a tour to South Africa in 1961–62 where the five-test series was drawn 2–2. The victories in the third and fifth tests were the first overseas victories New Zealand achieved. Reid scored 1,915 runs in the tour, setting a record for the most runs scored by a touring batsman of South Africa as a result.

New Zealand won their first test series in their three match 1969/70 tour of Pakistan 1–0. This was the first ever series win by New Zealand after almost 40 years and 30 consecutive winless series.

===1970 to 2000===
In 1973 Richard Hadlee debuted and the rate at which New Zealand won Tests picked up dramatically. Hadlee was one of the best pace bowlers of his generation, playing 86 Tests for New Zealand before he retired in 1990. Of the 86 Tests that Hadlee played in New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. In 1977/78 New Zealand won its first Test against England, at the 48th attempt. Hadlee took 10 wickets in the match.

During the 1980s New Zealand also had the services of one of its best-ever batsman, Martin Crowe and a number of good players such as John Wright, Bruce Edgar, John F. Reid, Andrew Jones, Geoff Howarth, Jeremy Coney, Ian Smith, John Bracewell, Lance Cairns, Stephen Boock, and Ewen Chatfield, who were capable of playing the occasional match-winning performance and consistently making a valuable contribution to a Test match.

The best example of New Zealand&#x27;s two star players (R. Hadlee and M. Crowe) putting in match-winning performances and other players making good contributions is New Zealand versus Australia, 1985 at Brisbane. In Australia&#x27;s first innings Hadlee took 9–52. In New Zealand&#x27;s only innings, M Crowe scored 188 and John F. Reid 108. Edgar, Wright, Coney, Jeff Crowe, V. Brown, and Hadlee scored between 17 and 54*. In Australia&#x27;s second innings, Hadlee took 6–71 and Chatfield 3–75. New Zealand won by an innings and 41 runs.

One-day cricket also gave New Zealand a chance to compete more regularly than Test cricket with the better sides in world cricket. In one-day cricket a batsman does not need to score centuries to win games for his side and bowlers do not need to bowl the opposition out. One-day games can be won by one batsman getting a 50, a few others getting 30s, bowlers bowling economically and everyone fielding well. These were requirements New Zealand players could consistently meet and thus developed a good one-day record against all sides.

Perhaps New Zealand&#x27;s most infamous one-day match was the &quot;under arm&quot; match against Australia at the MCG in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.

When New Zealand next played in the tri-series in Australia in 1983, Lance Cairns became a cult hero for his one-day batting. In one match against Australia, he hit six sixes at the MCG, one of the world&#x27;s largest grounds. Few fans remember that New Zealand lost this game by 149 runs. However, Lance&#x27;s greatest contribution to New Zealand cricket was his son Chris Cairns.

Chris Cairns made his debut one year before Hadlee retired in 1990. Cairns, one of New Zealand&#x27;s best all-rounders, led the 1990s bowling attack with Danny Morrison. Stephen Fleming, New Zealand&#x27;s most prolific scorer, led the batting and the team into the 21st century. Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan also scored plenty of runs for New Zealand, but both retired earlier than expected.

Daniel Vettori made his debut as an 18-year-old in 1997, and when he took over from Fleming as captain in 2007 he was regarded as the best spinning all-rounder in world cricket. On 26 August 2009, Daniel Vettori became the eighth player and second left-arm bowler (after Chaminda Vaas) in history to take 300 wickets and score 3000 test runs, joining the illustrious club. Vettori decided to take an indefinite break from international short form cricket in 2011 but continued to represent New Zealand in Test cricket and returned for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

On 4 April 1996, New Zealand achieved a unique world record, where the whole team was adjudged Man of the Match for team performance against 4-run victory over the West Indies. This is recorded as the only time where whole team achieved such an award.

===21st century===
New Zealand started the new millennium by winning the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy in Kenya to claim their first ICC tournament. This was a knockout tournament where teams were seeded according to their performance in Cricket World Cup 1999, the top five teams from that world cup gained direct entry to quarter-finals and while remaining six teams had to play the pre-quarter finals. New Zealand gained direct entry to quarter-finals where they faced Zimbabwe against whom they had recently lost an ODI series, after a nervy start they pulled things back and romped to a crushing 64-run victory to get through to the semis. In semis they faced Pakistan, a team who had managed to knock New Zealand out from last World Cup at this very stage. New Zealand beat Pakistan this time in a thrilling run-chase to enter the final. In the final, they faced India who had knocked out world champions Australia and defending champions South Africa. New Zealand won the toss and opted to bowl but the decision seemed to backfire as India romped to a 141 run opening partnership in 27 overs, New Zealand somehow managed to pull things back but the target was a daunting 265, and in reply they struggled for the most part of their innings but in the end, it was a 122-run partnership between Chris Cairns and Chris Harris that took them close the target before Cairns finished the game with two balls to spare as New Zealand won its first-ever ICC event.

Shane Bond played 18 Tests for NZ between 2001 and 2009 but missed far more through injury. When fit, he added a dimension to the NZ bowling attack that had been missing since Hadlee retired, taking 87 wickets at an average of 22.09.

The rise of the financial power of the BCCI had an immense effect on NZ cricket and its players. The BCCI managed to convince other boards not to pick players who had joined the rival Twenty-20 Indian Cricket League. NZ Cricket lost the services of Shane Bond, Lou Vincent, Andre Adams, Hamish Marshall and Daryl Tuffey. The money to be made from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as Craig McMillan and Scott Styris (from Test cricket) to retire earlier than they would have otherwise. After the demise of the Indian Cricket League Bond and Tuffey again played for New Zealand.

Vettori stood down as Test captain in 2011 leading to star batsman Ross Taylor to take his place. Taylor led New Zealand for a year which included a thrilling win in a low scoring Test match against Australia in Hobart, their first win over Australia since 1993. In 2012/13 Brendon McCullum became captain and new players such as Kane Williamson, Corey Anderson, Doug Bracewell, Trent Boult and Jimmy Neesham emerged as world-class performers. McCullum captained New Zealand to series wins against the West Indies and India in 2013/14 and both Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2014/15 increasing New Zealand&#x27;s rankings in both Test and ODI formats. In the series against India McCullum scored 302 at Wellington to become New Zealand&#x27;s first Test triple centurion.

In early 2015 New Zealand made the final of the Cricket World Cup, going through the tournament undefeated until the final, where they lost to Australia by seven wickets. In 2015 the New Zealand national cricket team played under the name of Aotearoa for their first match against Zimbabwe to celebrate te Wiki o te Reo Māori (Māori Language Week).

In mid-2015 New Zealand toured England, performing well, drawing the Test series 1–1, and losing the One Day series, 2–3. From October to November 2015, and in February 2016, New Zealand played Australia in two Test Series, three and two games respectively. With a changing of an era in the Australian team, New Zealand was rated as a chance of winning especially in New Zealand. New Zealand lost both series by 2–0

In February 2016, Kane Williamson was appointed as the captain of the team after Brendon McCullum&#x27;s retirement after playing his 101st test against Australia at Christchurch. Williamson&#x27;s first international series as the full-time captain was Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup 2016 in India in which the team won all four of its group games but lost to England in the semi-final at Delhi. After the annual rankings update on 4 May 2016 the team was awarded the No. 1 ranking in T20Is. The team then got into a rough patch after the T20WC where they would go onto lose away series to South Africa, India and Australia. In their home season they managed to beat Pakistan for the first time in a test series after 32 years, whitewashed Bangladesh across formats, won the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy against Australia but went onto lose to South Africa in T20I, ODI and Test series.

New Zealand started the 2017 international season with a tri-series involving hosts Ireland, and Bangladesh as a preparation for upcoming Champions Trophy in England. New Zealand managed to win the tri-series as they finished at the top of the points table but the Champions Trophy turned out to be a disastrous campaign as they got knocked out by Bangladesh and ended the tournament without a single win, the worst performance for them in an ICC Event. After that the team had to wait four months for their next tour which was to India in which both the ODI and T20I series were closely contested but New Zealand lost both by a scoreline of 2–1. The home season started with whitewash of the West Indies across formats followed by whitewash of Pakistan in the ODI series but after that New Zealand lost the T20I series to Pakistan and in the process lost their No. 1 ranking in T20Is. Then they took part in the first ever T20I tri-series involving full-members the Trans-Tasman T20I Tri-Series in which they ended up runners-up to Australia and England finished third. Then they played England where they lost the ODI series but then managed to win the test series. This was their first test series win against England after 19 years and 4th overall in their 87 year old rivalry.

New Zealand played no matches in the 2018 season. In 2018–19 they began with a tour of UAE in Oct–Dec 2018 to play Pakistan. The tour started with New Zealand suffering a whitewash in the T20I series but they drew the ODI series, 1–1. New Zealand produced a stunning act of resilience to register their first away test series win against Pakistan after 49 years. This put New Zealand 3rd on the test rankings table. After this in their home season they beat Sri Lanka across formats, lost to India in the ODI series before managing to beat them in the T20I series and lastly they beat Bangladesh across formats and consequently they climbed to No. 2 spot in Test rankings.

New Zealand started the 2019 season with the Cricket World Cup in England &amp; Wales. New Zealand had a terrific start to their World Cup campaign as they remained unbeaten and top of the table for their first six games. Their formed dipped after that initial burst as they managed to lose their next three group games convincingly and only just managed to get through to the semi-finals on net run-rate. In the semi-final, they stunned favourites India on the reserve day to reach a second consecutive final. In the final, the scores were tied after 50 overs and again after the Super Over. England won by having hit more boundaries. This boundary countback rule was criticised and a couple of months later ICC abolished the rule.

In December 2022, captain Kane Williamson stepped down as test captain and was replaced by Tim Southee. Williamson will remain the white-ball captain.

==Team colours==

New Zealand&#x27;s kit is manufactured by Canterbury of New Zealand, who replaced previous manufacturer WStar in 2009. When playing Test cricket, New Zealand&#x27;s cricket whites feature logo of the sponsors Gillette on the left of the shirt, the ANZ logo on the left sleeve and on the middle of the shirt and the Canterbury logo on the right sleeve. New Zealand fielders may wear a black cap (in the style of a baseball cap rather than the baggy cap worn by some teams) or a white sun hat with the New Zealand Cricket logo in the middle. Helmets are also coloured black (although until 1996, they used to be white with the silver fern logo encased in a black circle).

In limited overs cricket, New Zealand&#x27;s ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the ANZ logo across the centre, with the silver fern badge on the left of the shirt, Canterbury logo on the right sleeve and the Ford logo on the right. In ODIs, the kit comprises a black shirt with blue accents and black trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a beige shirt with black accents and black trousers. In ICC limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor&#x27;s logos moving to the sleeve and &#x27;NEW ZEALAND&#x27; printed across the front.

In ODI, New Zealand wore Beige and brown between 1980 World Series Cricket and 1988 World Series Cricket. The 1983–1984 version was made popular by the Black Caps supporter group Beige Brigade, who sells the version of this uniform to the general public together with a &quot;moral contract&quot; which explains the expectations that come with being a Beige Brigadier. and was also worn in the inaugural Twenty20 international between New Zealand and Australia. Between 1991 and 1997 grey or silver (with some splashes of black or white) was worn instead. Until 2000, the ODI uniform was teal with black accents.

Previous suppliers were Adidas (World Series Cricket 1980–1990), ISC (World Cup World Cup 1992 and 1996, World Series 1993–97) Canterbury (1998–1999), Asics (who supplied all the 1999 Cricket World Cup participating teams) and WStar (2000–2009).

Previous sponsors were DB Draught (1990–1994 in the front, 1995–1997 in the sleeve), Bank of New Zealand (1993–94 and 1997–99 in the front), Clear Communications, later TelstraClear (1997–2000 in the front, 2001–2005 in the sleeve), National Bank of New Zealand (2000–2014) and Dheeraj and East Coast (2009–2010), since 2014 ANZ is the current sponsor, due to National Bank&#x27;s rebranding as ANZ. Amul became the new sponsor in May 2017 for the ICC CT.

ICC World Cup 2023 started on 5 October 2023. They have ended their journey to this tournament by getting defeated to India by 70 runs in the semi-final.

In December 2023, there had been a six-year deal with Castore to manufacture their kits starting from October 2024.

==Records==
===World records===

* Richard Hadlee, one of New Zealand and the world&#x27;s best all-rounders, took the world record for most Test wickets (374) vs India at Bangalore in 1988. Hadlee was the first bowler to reach 400 Test wickets, vs India at Christchurch in 1990, and finished his career with 431 wickets. He subsequently lost the record to Kapil Dev.
* The black caps would be known for their world record of having the most semi final appearances of any country but The Black Caps have yet to claim the trophy.
* Corey Anderson holds record for the second fastest century in One Day Internationals (or any other format of international cricket). Playing against West Indies, he scored his ton in just 36 balls. Corey Anderson lost the record to AB de Villiers when AB scored a century in just 31 balls against West Indies.
* In a One Day International in 1996, the entire New Zealand team were awarded man of the match against the West Indies, the first such occasion.

* Daniel Vettori was the first cricketer to take four wickets and score a half-century in each innings of a Test match, a feat he achieved against Bangladesh in October 2008 at Chittagong. His figures were 5/95 and 4/74 with the ball and 55* and 76 with the bat.
* Colin Munro is the first player in to score three Twenty20 International hundreds. This was accomplished on 3 January 2018 against the West Indies when he scored 104 off 88 balls, with 3 fours and 10 sixes.

<text>The Topper is an 11 foot sailing dinghy designed by Ian Proctor. The Topper was a one-design boat until 2023 when a new version was produced, and is sailed mostly around the British Isles. It was recognised as a World Sailing Class. The boat previously constructed from polypropylene, and now roto moulded, is popular as a racing boat or for sail training. The class association (ITCA) organise racing events, which range from small travellers to major championships. The RYA run squads alongside the events; in these squads young sailors who are given specialist race coaching. It is sailed widely among junior sailors in the UK and Ireland and there is a growing fleet in China.

==Class history and design==
The Topper was designed by Ian Proctor in 1977 as a One-Design racing boat. The Topper was initially manufactured and developed by John Dunhill of J V Dunhill Boats Ltd and has been in continuous production for over four decades and over 49,000 examples have now been sold. The Topper dinghy is built in the UK by Topper International Ltd. owned by Martin Fry who purchased the company from Guinness Leisure in 1983. In 1977 the boat won the Design Council Award and the Horner Award for achievements in plastics. The Topper featured in the BBC show Tomorrow’s World with its innovative construction in polypropylene.

The Topper dinghy is widely used for racing, but it has also gained popularity as a boat in which to learn how to sail. The Topper was originally designed with a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) hull making it a relatively light but durable boat, however, it was later decided that the Topper should be constructed with injection moulding, using polypropylene, which is less expensive but heavier and less rigid.

In 2021, the injection mould was damaged beyond repair and would have required replacement. As this was not financially viable, the boat was redesigned to be rotomoulded in polyethylene meaning the iconic red colour on the deck had to be replaced with hull colour. The new version was introduced in 2023.

Although the Topper was originally rigged with an aft mainsheet, since 2004 the option to use a centre main has been allowed. The motivation for such a change being that most other dinghies, including the ones Topper sailors are likely to advance to, are rigged with centre mainsheets.

In 2005 a smaller 4.2 m2 sail was approved, which can optionally be used in favour of the standard 5.3 m2 sail. The smaller sail is more efficient than a larger sail that is reefed. The first 4.2m² national championships were held in 2010.

In 2020, after two years of development, a new 6.4m² rig for the Topper was introduced.

At 11&#x27; the Topper is named for the ability to transport it on the roof of a car, and the mast splits into two sections, allowing the spars to be stored and transported.

Despite the age of the design, the Topper Class remains one of the fastest growing classes in the UK, with a very active national association. The Topper class is a recognised World Sailing International Class since 2005. The GBR Nationals and the World Championships often have over 200 boats in the 5.3 class and 70 in the 4.2.

The largest fleet is in Great Britain where the class is part of the RYA &quot;pathway&quot; class program with turnouts at the RYA regional Championships and the highest percentage of RYA Transitional Youth Squad members. Most &#x27;GB Young Sailor of the Year&#x27; nominations in recent years have come from within the Topper Class.

<doc id="478128" wikidata="Q609809" url="?curid=478128" title="Protein isoform">
<text>A protein isoform, or &quot;protein variant&quot;, is a member of a set of highly similar proteins that originate from a single gene and are the result of genetic differences. While many perform the same or similar biological roles, some isoforms have unique functions. A set of protein isoforms may be formed from alternative splicings, variable promoter usage, or other post-transcriptional modifications of a single gene; post-translational modifications are generally not considered. (For that, see Proteoforms.) Through RNA splicing mechanisms, mRNA has the ability to select different protein-coding segments (exons) of a gene, or even different parts of exons from RNA to form different mRNA sequences. Each unique sequence produces a specific form of a protein.

The discovery of isoforms could explain the discrepancy between the small number of protein coding regions of genes revealed by the human genome project and the large diversity of proteins seen in an organism: different proteins encoded by the same gene could increase the diversity of the proteome. Isoforms at the RNA level are readily characterized by cDNA transcript studies. Many human genes possess confirmed alternative splicing isoforms. It has been estimated that ~100,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) can be identified in humans. Isoforms at the protein level can manifest in the deletion of whole domains or shorter loops, usually located on the surface of the protein.

== Definition ==
One single gene has the ability to produce multiple proteins that differ both in structure and composition; this process is regulated by the alternative splicing of mRNA, though it is not clear to what extent such a process affects the diversity of the human proteome, as the abundance of mRNA transcript isoforms does not necessarily correlate with the abundance of protein isoforms. Three-dimensional protein structure comparisons can be used to help determine which, if any, isoforms represent functional protein products, and the structure of most isoforms in the human proteome has been predicted by AlphaFold and publicly released at isoform.io. The specificity of translated isoforms is derived by the protein&#x27;s structure/function, as well as the cell type and developmental stage during which they are produced. Determining specificity becomes more complicated when a protein has multiple subunits and each subunit has multiple isoforms.

For example, the 5&#x27; AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme, which performs different roles in human cells, has 3 subunits:
* α, catalytic domain, has two isoforms: α1 and α2 which are encoded from PRKAA1 and PRKAA2
* β, regulatory domain, has two isoforms: β1 and β2 which are encoded from PRKAB1 and PRKAB2
* γ, regulatory domain, has three isoforms: γ1, γ2, and γ3 which are encoded from PRKAG1, PRKAG2, and PRKAG3
In human skeletal muscle, the preferred form is α2β2γ1. But in the human liver, the most abundant form is α1β2γ1.

== Mechanism ==
The primary mechanisms that produce protein isoforms are alternative splicing and variable promoter usage, though modifications due to genetic changes, such as mutations and polymorphisms are sometimes also considered distinct isoforms.

Alternative splicing is the main post-transcriptional modification process that produces mRNA transcript isoforms, and is a major molecular mechanism that may contribute to protein diversity. The spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein, is the molecular machine inside the nucleus responsible for RNA cleavage and ligation, removing non-protein coding segments (introns).

Because splicing is a process that occurs between transcription and translation, its primary effects have mainly been studied through genomics techniques—for example, microarray analyses and RNA sequencing have been used to identify alternatively spliced transcripts and measure their abundances. Transcript abundance is often used as a proxy for the abundance of protein isoforms, though proteomics experiments using gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry have demonstrated that the correlation between transcript and protein counts is often low, and that one protein isoform is usually dominant. One 2015 study states that the cause of this discrepancy likely occurs after translation, though the mechanism is essentially unknown. Consequently, although alternative splicing has been implicated as an important link between variation and disease, there is no conclusive evidence that it acts primarily by producing novel protein isoforms.

Alternative splicing generally describes a tightly regulated process in which alternative transcripts are intentionally generated by the splicing machinery. However, such transcripts are also produced by splicing errors in a process called &quot;noisy splicing,&quot; and are also potentially translated into protein isoforms. Although ~95% of multi-exonic genes are thought to be alternatively spliced, one study on noisy splicing observed that most of the different low-abundance transcripts are noise, and predicts that most alternative transcript and protein isoforms present in a cell are not functionally relevant.

Other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory steps can also produce different protein isoforms. Variable promoter usage occurs when the transcriptional machinery of a cell (RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and other enzymes) begin transcription at different promoters—the region of DNA near a gene that serves as an initial binding site—resulting in slightly modified transcripts and protein isoforms.

== Characteristics ==
Generally, one protein isoform is labeled as the canonical sequence based on criteria such as its prevalence and similarity to orthologous—or functionally analogous—sequences in other species. Isoforms are assumed to have similar functional properties, as most have similar sequences, and share some to most exons with the canonical sequence. However, some isoforms show much greater divergence (for example, through trans-splicing), and can share few to no exons with the canonical sequence. In addition, they can have different biological effects—for example, in an extreme case, the function of one isoform can promote cell survival, while another promotes cell death—or can have similar basic functions but differ in their sub-cellular localization. A 2016 study, however, functionally characterized all the isoforms of 1,492 genes and determined that most isoforms behave as &quot;functional alloforms.&quot; The authors came to the conclusion that isoforms behave like distinct proteins after observing that the functional of most isoforms did not overlap. Because the study was conducted on cells &quot;in vitro&quot;, it is not known if the isoforms in the expressed human proteome share these characteristics. Additionally, because the function of each isoform must generally be determined separately, most identified and predicted isoforms still have unknown functions.

=== Glycoform ===
A glycoform is an isoform of a protein that differs only with respect to the number or type of attached glycan. Glycoproteins often consist of a number of different glycoforms, with alterations in the attached saccharide or oligosaccharide. These modifications may result from differences in biosynthesis during the process of glycosylation, or due to the action of glycosidases or glycosyltransferases. Glycoforms may be detected through detailed chemical analysis of separated glycoforms, but more conveniently detected through differential reaction with lectins, as in lectin affinity chromatography and lectin affinity electrophoresis. Typical examples of glycoproteins consisting of glycoforms are the blood proteins as orosomucoid, antitrypsin, and haptoglobin. An unusual glycoform variation is seen in neuronal cell adhesion molecule, NCAM involving polysialic acids, PSA.

==Examples==

* G-actin: despite its conserved nature, it has a varying number of isoforms (at least six in mammals).
* Creatine kinase, the presence of which in the blood can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, exists in 3 isoforms.
* Hyaluronan synthase, the enzyme responsible for the production of hyaluronan, has three isoforms in mammalian cells.
* UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme superfamily responsible for the detoxification pathway of many drugs, environmental pollutants, and toxic endogenous compounds has 16 known isoforms encoded in the human genome.
*G6PDA: normal ratio of active isoforms in cells of any tissue is 1:1 shared with G6PDG. This is precisely the normal isoform ratio in hyperplasia. Only one of these isoforms is found during neoplasia.
Monoamine oxidase, a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of monoamines, exists in two isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B.

<text>A bartender (also known as a barkeep or barman or barmaid or a mixologist) is a person who formulates and serves alcoholic or soft drink beverages behind the bar, usually in a licensed establishment as well as in restaurants and nightclubs, but also occasionally at private parties. Bartenders also usually maintain the supplies and inventory for the bar. As well as serving beer and wine, a bartender can generally also mix classic cocktails such as a Cosmopolitan, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Negroni.

Bartenders are also responsible for confirming that customers meet the legal drinking age requirements before serving them alcoholic beverages. In certain countries, such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, bartenders are legally required to refuse more alcohol to drunk customers.

Mixology is defined as the art or skill of preparing mixed drinks. At its core, the purpose of this practice is to craft cocktails. However, the science and skills required to successfully practice mixology are more intricate than what is seen at face value. The key to mixing drinks is knowing the ideal quantity of each ingredient needed to create the flavor profile required. Mixology aims to both elevate and balance the various flavors found in a cocktail. Mixology is essentially edible chemistry in the form of cocktails.

==History==

Historically, bartending was a profession with a low reputation. It was perceived through the lens of ethical issues and various legal constraints related to the serving of alcohol.

The pioneers of bartending as a serious profession appeared in the 19th century. Jerry Thomas established the image of the bartender as a creative professional, credited with being the father of American Mixology. He earned this title by publishing &quot;Jerry Thomas&#x27; Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot;, the first guide to making cocktails in 1862. Thomas perfected his skills by owning and manning saloons across the New York City area throughout the 1800s. Mixology started to take shape in the years following Thomas&#x27; book. Harry Johnson published &quot;Harry Johnson&#x27;s New and Improved Illustrated Bartender&#x27;s Manua&quot;l in 1882. Both of these books shared recipes for dozens of unique drinks that combined ingredients people had never thought to combine before. Thomas and Johnson incorporated flavored spirits, liqueurs, and fortified wines to their cocktails, which was a new concept. Mixology took off after these two publishing. By the late 1800s, the term mixology was common and widely used.

At the turn of the 20th century, slightly fewer than half the bartenders in London were women, such as Ada Coleman. &quot;Barmaids&quot;, as they were called, were usually the daughters of tradesmen or mechanics or, occasionally, young women from the &quot;better-born&quot; classes who had been &quot;thrown upon their own resources&quot; and needed an income. Bartending has often been associated with the struggles of marginalized groups in the workforce, such as African-American women. However, women have sometimes been restricted from bartending. For example, &quot;Goesaert v. Cleary&quot;, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Michigan law which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more unless their father or husband owned the establishment. The decision was subsequently overruled by &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976). 
After the rise of the cocktail in the early 20th century, Americans were faced with prohibition laws from the Federal government. However, bartending culture remained alive throughout prohibition (1920-1933). Working in underground speakeasies, bartenders continued to provide their patrons with delicious cocktails. Following the suspension of the eighteenth amendment and release of legal booze back into the market, the cocktail era unfortunately took a dip. People drank less and the Great Depression severely limited the ability of people to buy a drink. Cocktails started to be limited to the rich and famous. The celebrities in Los Angeles took a certain liking to the recipes of the old days. But the general population would no longer mix their drinks. Individualism was crushed similar to the food industry. The industry needed a renaissance and it wasn&#x27;t until the late 90&#x27;s that we saw the true re-emergence of the cocktail bar.

The bartending profession was generally a second occupation, used as transitional work for students to gain customer experience or to save money for university fees. The reason for this is because bartenders in tipping countries such as Canada and the United States, can make significant money from their tips. This view of bartending as a career is changing around the world, however, and bartending has become a profession by choice rather than necessity. It includes specialized education—European Bartender School operates in 25 countries.
Cocktail competitions such as World Class and Bacardi Legacy have recognized talented bartenders in the past decade and these bartenders, and others, spread the love of cocktails and hospitality throughout the world. Kathy Sullivan, owner of Sidecar Bartending, expressed the difficulties with becoming a prolific bartender, comparing the bartender to the drink they make: &quot;In drinks you want balance. And you have to be balanced physically, emotionally and mentally.&quot;

== Art of Mixology ==
Mixology&#x27;s purpose is to create new or unique cocktails that center around a specific flavor profile or theme. Because of this goal, flavor balance is critical, and is where science comes in. There are four main components to a cocktail: the spirit, the acid, the base and the garnish. Though in more general terms the most important elements consist of the base, a modifying, smoothing or aromatizing agent, an additional special flavouring or coloring agent. 

The base will always be the most dominant ingredient. It constitutes at least 50% of the entire volume of the cocktail, and always consists of spirit based liquors or wine based liquors. The type of base will determine the style of liquor, thus gin based cocktails, such as the martini, will differ from whisky based cocktails, such as the Manhattan. It is possible to mix a cocktail combining a number of bases, as long as they share essential characteristics, though it is considered &quot;dangerous&quot;. 

The modifying agent functions as a buffer for the sharp bite of the base, and adds character to its natural flavour. Modifiers can be classified into the three categories of aromatics and bitters, fruit juices (with or without sugar), and smoothing agents (such as cream, sugar or eggs). Modifiers are often used sparingly so as not to overpower the base, Embury suggested a maximum of half an egg white, one quarter of a whole egg, one tablespoon of heavy cream or one teaspoon of sugar per drink. 

Special flavouring agents, including not only non-alcoholic syrups but also various liqueurs and cordials, as well as other ingredients which could also be used as modifiers. Like the modifiers, special care must be taken so that the special flavouring agent does not overpower the base. For this reason quantities are often limited to drops and dashes. 

Mixologists experiment with different quantities of each component to create a desired flavor or particular drink. Spirits can include gin, whiskey, rum, tequila, mezcal, and modifying liqueurs.
Acids are sour, sharp flavors whose goal is to bring out flavor notes in spirits, add complexity and brighten drinks; they include fresh juices, such as lemon. Bases are sweeteners that aim to balance out spirits and acids; they can include simple syrup, honey, agave nectar, and liqueurs. Mixologists aim to find the ideal balance between acids and bases, so that each flavor is tasted, but not one is overpowering. The fourth component of a cocktail is a garnish. Mixologists top their creations with garnishes and can take more free rein here. Common garnishes include decorative lemon twists, smoked herbs, and edible flowers. Garnishes, finishing touches, and the presentation of drinks, allow for a mixologist&#x27;s artistic side to shine through.

==By country==
===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, bar work is often not regarded as a long-term profession (unless the barman or barwoman is also the landlord), but more often as a second occupation, or transitional work for students to gain customer experience or to save money for university fees. It therefore lacks traditional employment protections, so there is often a high turnover. The high turnover of staff due to low wages and poor employee benefits results in a shortage of skilled bartenders. Whereas a career bar manager would know drink recipes, serving techniques, alcohol contents, correct gas mixes and licensing law and would often have cordial relations with regular customers, short-term staff may lack these skills. Some pubs prefer experienced staff, although pub chains tend to accept inexperienced staff and provide training.

Tipping bar staff in the United Kingdom is uncommon, not considered mandatory. The appropriate way to tip a barman or barwomen in the UK is to say &#x27;have one for yourself&#x27;, encouraging the employee to buy themselves a drink with one&#x27;s money. Staff may instead opt to add a modest amount to a bill to take in cash at the end of their shift.

===United States===

After the end of Prohibition in the United States in 1933, Milwaukee did not grant women bartending licenses, unless the women were the daughters or wives of the bar&#x27;s owner. In 1970, Dolly Williams filed a complaint with the state regarding this, and the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations ordered the city to stop banning female bartenders. Milwaukee appealed against this, but in March 1971, a Madison court sided with Wisconsin and Milwaukee&#x27;s common council announced that beginning April 1, 1971, gender would stop being an obstacle to obtaining a bartending license. &quot;Goesaert v. Cleary&quot;, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Michigan law which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more unless their father or husband owned the establishment. The decision was subsequently overruled by &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976). 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics data on occupations in the United States, including that of bartender, publishes a detailed description of the bartender&#x27;s typical duties and employment and earning statistics by those so employed, with 55% of a bartender&#x27;s take-home pay coming in the form of tips. The hourly wage a bartender receives can vary depending on the state. The federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), and the laws of most states, allow employers a tip credit, which counts employees tips toward minimum wage. As of September 26, 2020, the federal minimum wage rate is $7.25/hour.

As a result of the professionalization of the trade, craft bartenders have begun to establish themselves as the elite class of the bartending profession. &quot;Craft&quot; cocktails are curated drinks using high-quality ingredients, generally accompanied by a higher price as well. Craft bartenders typically operate in more upscale venues, such as hotel bars. They make the majority of their income in tips from higher-class customers.

Bartenders in the United States may work in a large variety of bars. These include hotel bars, restaurant bars, sports bars, gay bars, piano bars, and dive bars. Also growing in popularity is the portable bar, which can be moved to different venues and special events.

Hospitality bartenders make up 77% of the membership of the United States Bartender&#x27;s Guild. As a result, the union lobbies for higher tips with lower base wages. Lower-class bartenders generally do not participate in the union, since their customers may not tip or may not be able to afford to.

The bartender culture in the United States encourages bartenders to be inviting and friendly to their patrons. Their customers&#x27; needs and wants become their priority, as well as their safety and enjoyment of their time at the bar. Bartenders are urged to take care of their patrons however they can.

Bartenders may attend special schools or learn while on the job. Bartenders in the United States usually have on-the-job training, from the owners, management, or other superior staff with experience. Prospective bartenders may gain experience by working as wait staff in a restaurant with a bar. Some vocational schools offer bartenders licenses. Some US states require a bartenders license or a health certificate issued from the state.

Most pubs and bars seek to recruit outgoing, personable individuals as bartenders. All bartenders must comply with all food and beverage regulations, in the United States. All bartenders in the United States should be knowledgeable in mixing, garnishing, and serving drinks with a positive attitude and excellent communication skills. The competition for jobs is high in this field of work.

===Japan===

The Japanese way of bartending is like &quot;a time-capsule of 1930s international bartending,&quot; cocktail historian David Wondrich said. The Japanese cut-glass mixing beaker is in almost universal use nowadays. Japanese bar-tools are also all widely used. The world has been mesmerised by the art and style of Japanese bartending. Japanese law generally requires food and drink to be served under (or in conjunction with) the supervision of a food hygiene supervisor, and this also applies to bartenders. Nippon Bartenders&#x27; Association (N.B.A.) is an industry association for bartenders. It is an exam organized by the target is people over the age of 20 who work as a bartender in the restaurant industry. It is a subject exam on liquor and cocktails from the N.B.A. Official Cocktail Book. N.B.A. certification can also take exams other than members, but N.B.A. membership exam fees will be cheaper. Since the basic knowledge as a bartender is measured, it can be said that it is a suitable qualification for young people who study cocktails every day while working in the field to measure the results of their efforts.

=== China ===
In China, with the prosperity of the bar industry, bartenders have gradually become a popular profession. Professional bartenders need to obtain the certification of the National Labor Department&#x27;s vocational technical ability appraisement. Those who pass the exam will be issued a corresponding level of skill certificate by the China vocational education qualification certification center, which is a compliance certificate for relevant personnel&#x27;s job hunting, appointment, promotion, etc. , the certificate is valid nationwide. In China, tens of thousands of people have obtained the &quot;Bartender Qualification Certificate&quot; issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection units. With the great increase in the number of cocktail bars, as the pillar of the bar, the salary structure of the bartender includes the basic salary + service charge + drink commission. Any kind of bartending method requires basic bartending knowledge. Junior bartenders are required to master the varieties and formulas of 20 kinds of cocktails, and the training time is 40 hours; intermediate bartenders are required to master the varieties and formulas of 40 kinds of cocktails, and the training time is 60 credit hours; senior bartenders are not only required to master the varieties and recipes of hundreds of cocktails, but also focus on creating their own cocktails and managing bars.

=== Canada ===

Bartenders can be found in many establishments across Canada. They may appear in nightclubs, restaurants, bars, hotels and even airports in cities. Canada does not have a national-wide bartender certification; instead, people must apply for a new provincial certification in each province in which they want to bartend. Some provinces do not require certification, such as Saskatchewan, Labrador, Quebec, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where there is no legally mandatory certification to serve alcohol, but certain documents for serving alcoholic beverages are marked as &quot;recommended&quot; in the province, and employers have a right to ask their bartenders to have them.

As social attitudes toward legal responsibility change, more and more provinces are requiring certification for responsible alcohol sales of bartenders, managers and even event and liquor store employees. The provinces that require bartender certification are Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia. All of these certifications come with a card or certificate. If bartender certification is required in the province where the bartender is located, health and safety inspectors may ask to see a bartender&#x27;s certifications when inspecting his workplace.

== Mixologist ==
A mixologist is a person who has studied the deep history and science of mixed drinks and cocktails. While often confused with a bartender, there are notable differences between the two. A mixologist is more specific than a bartender. While all mixologists can be bartenders, not all bartenders can be classified as mixologists. The divide boils down to the skills needed to mix unique drinks. Mixologists must have the in-depth knowledge of how different ingredients interact when mixed, and what flavors they create together. This expertise allows mixologists to apply their skills in various manners.

Mixologists can create cocktails for a variety of reasons. They may purposely use unique ingredients, such as house-made ones, historical ones, uncommon ones or obscure flavors. They may reimagine classic cocktails by putting their own spin on them, whether in terms of taste or technique. By examining the chemistry behind basic bar drinks, mixologists can take them to the next level. Additionally, they may toy with the chemical makeup of drinks to make them more sour, bitter, sweet, tangy or deep. Lastly, they may make entirely new cocktails by implementing innovative techniques or mixing flavors that have not been mixed before. This skill set allows mixologists to practice mixology in various ways. Whether it be for fun, as a profession, or as a consultant to restaurants or spirit companies, the skills required are the same.

=== Notable mixologists ===

==== Ada &quot;Coley&quot; Coleman ====
Ada &quot;Coley&quot; Coleman (1875–1966) is remembered as the most famous female bartender of all time. The British mixologist was one of only two women to be the head bartender at The Savoy in London, where she developed the Hanky Panky (a cocktail made with gin, vermouth and fernet-branca). During her tenure, Coley made cocktails for Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden and &quot;Diamond&quot; Jim Brady.

==== Harry Craddock ====
Harry Craddock (1876–1963) was a bartender during the prohibition era. The British mixologist created and wrote the Savoy Cocktail Book, which is referred to as the cocktail bible in the mixology world.

==== Dale Degroff ====
Dale Degroff (born 1948) is known by his nickname: the King of Cocktails. The American mixologist is known for reviving and improving classic 19th century cocktails with new flavor combinations and fresh ingredients.

==== Dick Bradsell ====
Dick Bradsell (1959–2016) was a British mixologist. He invented many classic cocktails, such as the Espresso Martini, the Treacle and the Bramble. Dick trained many top mixologists in the art of hospitality and drink making during his lifetime. He is known for always opting for fresh juices and ingredients, over anything pre-made or run of the mill.

==== Erika Moore and Raquel Ravenell ====
Modern day mixologists are growing their presence and following through the use of social media. The digital age allows mixologists to merge their craft with technical tools and share it with a wider audience. Erika Moore and Raquel Ravenell, of @whiskeyandrosemary are Instagram famous mixologists. The Atlanta-based duo is known for their use of obscure ingredients such as eucalyptus raw cane syrup, chickpea water, spinach, marshmallow syrup, BBQ sauce, flamed cinnamon and beef jerky garnish.
