<doc id="470740" wikidata="Q1426217" url="?curid=470740" title="Garrison Dam">
<text>Garrison Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam on the Missouri River in central North Dakota, U.S.
Constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1947 to 1953, at over in length, the dam is the fifth-largest earthen dam in the world. The reservoir impounded by the dam is Lake Sakakawea, which extends to Williston and the confluence with the Yellowstone River, near the Montana border. The dam and resulting reservoir inundated approximately one-sixth (16.6%) to one-fourth (25%) of Fort Berthold Indian Reservation&#x27;s land, resulting in the loss of homes, farmland, and community infrastructure for the Three Affiliated Tribes.

==Location==
Garrison Dam is located between Riverdale and Pick City, and named after the town of Garrison, directly north of the dam, across the reservoir. The dam is approximately midway between Bismarck and Minot, about west of U.S. Highway 83.

==History==

The dam was part of a flood control and hydroelectric power generation project named the Pick-Sloan Project along the river, after the two plan developers, Col. Lewis A. Pick and William Glenn Sloan. Local communities in the area had resisted having the dam built at other locations on the river where they would be affected.

In order to construct the dam, the US government needed to purchase of bottomlands in the Fort Berthold Reservation that would be flooded by the creation of Lake Sakakawea. These lands were owned by the Three Affiliated Tribes, and the territory &quot;had been their home for perhaps more than a millennium&quot;.

Threatened by confiscation under eminent domain, the tribes protested. A complete block of Garrison Dam power was denied because it would violate the 1935 Rural Electrification Act. The tribes gained remuneration, but lost 94% of their agricultural land in 1947, when they were forced to accept $5,105,625. This amount was increased to $7.5 million in 1949, but it did not fully compensate them for the loss of their important farmlands, homes, towns, and graves. They had cultivated the bottomlands and were able to be largely self-sufficient.

The final settlement legislation denied the tribes&#x27; right to use the reservoir shoreline for traditional grazing, hunting, fishing or other purposes, including irrigation development and royalty rights on all subsurface minerals within the reservoir area. About 1,700 residents were forcibly relocated, some to New Town, North Dakota at the northern end of the reservation.

Thus construction of Garrison Dam almost totally destroyed the traditional way of life for the Three Affiliated Tribes and made them much more dependent on the federal government. In addition, the size the lake, and the lack of bridges to cross it for decades, disrupted traditional relations among the peoples. It created new divisions among the segments on the reservation Construction on the $300-million dam project began in 1947, and its embankment was enclosed in April 1953. The dam was dedicated by President Eisenhower two months later. The Corps of Engineers completed earthwork in the fall of 1954.

Garrison Dam is one of six Missouri River Main stem dams operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District. The dam upstream of Garrison Dam is Fort Peck Dam (near Fort Peck, Montana). The dams downstream of Garrison Dam are: Oahe Dam (near Pierre, South Dakota), Big Bend Dam (near Fort Thompson, South Dakota), Fort Randall Dam (near Pickstown, South Dakota), and Gavins Point Dam (near Yankton, South Dakota). These six mainstem dams impound these Missouri River reservoirs with a total combined water storage capacity of approximately and approximately of water surface area.

In June 2011, in response to the 2011 Missouri River Floods, the dam was releasing more than , which greatly exceeded its previous record release of set in 1997. The first use of the emergency spillway due to flooding started on June 1, 2011, at 8:00am.

==Energy generation==
Hydropower turbines at Garrison Dam have an electric power generating nameplate capacity of 583.3 MW. Average production of 257 MW serves several hundred thousand customers.

==Fishing &amp; Recreation==
The Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery is the world&#x27;s largest walleye and northern pike producing facility and also works to restore endangered species, such as the pallid sturgeon.

A segment of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through the National Fish Hatchery and includes a stretch along the Missouri River shoreline where trail users are simultaneously on the Lewis &amp; Clark National Historic Trail.

<doc id="470742" wikidata="Q757838" url="?curid=470742" title="Keratitis">
<text>Keratitis is a condition in which the eye&#x27;s cornea, the clear dome on the front surface of the eye, becomes inflamed. The condition is often marked by moderate to intense pain and usually involves any of the following symptoms: pain, impaired eyesight, photophobia (light sensitivity), red eye and a &#x27;gritty&#x27; sensation. Diagnosis of infectious keratitis is usually made clinically based on the signs and symptoms as well as eye examination, but corneal scrapings may be obtained and evaluated using microbiological culture or other testing to identify the causative pathogen.

==Classification (by chronicity)==
===Acute===
* Acute epithelial keratitis
* Nummular keratitis
* Interstitial keratitis
* Disciform keratitis

===Chronic===
* Neurotrophic keratitis
* Mucous plaque keratitis

==Classification (infective)==
===Viral===

The most common causes of viral keratitis include herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), which cause herpes simplex keratitis and herpes zoster keratitis (a subtype of herpes zoster ophthalmicus) respectively. Herpes simplex keratitis occurs due to latent HSV reactivation in the ophthalmic nerve (the V1 branch of the trigeminal nerve). Herpes keratitis is classically associated with a branching (dendritic) infiltrate pattern of inflammation in the corneal epithelium and may cause clouding of the cornea. 

Approximately 8-20% of cases of shingles (due to VZV reactivation) involve the eyes as herpes zoster ophthalmicus. And VZV keratitis occurs in 13-76% of cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, usually 1 month after onset of symptoms. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is also associated with reactivation of ZVZ in the V1 branch (the ophthalmic nerve) of the trigeminal nerve. VZV keratitis presents as a dendriform epithelial keratitis pattern early in the course of the infection. ZVZ keratitis may cause clouding of the cornea, with 50% of cases involving inflammatory infiltrates in the stromal layer of the cornea, corneal scarring is a possible complication of VZV keratitis. Vaccination with the zoster vaccine is highly effective in preventing shingles, as well as herpes zoster ophthalmicus and herpes zoster keratitis.

===Bacterial===
* Bacterial keratitis. Bacterial infection of the cornea can follow from an injury or from wearing contact lenses. The bacteria involved are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and for contact lens wearers, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; produces enzymes that can digest the cornea.&quot;
* In those who wear contact lenses, bacteria are the most common causative agent of keratitis, with 90% of cases being due to a bacterial pathogen. Of those 90% of cases, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is responsible for 40%. &quot;Staph aureus&quot; and &quot;streptococci&quot; are other common bacterial pathogens responsible for infectious keratitis in contact lens wearers. Lens cases, used to store contact lenses, may form a biofilm leading to colonization of the contact lenses by bacteria, this is especially common with poor contact lens hygiene or improper storage.

===Fungal===
* Fungal keratitis, caused by &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot; (cf. Fusarium, causing an outbreak of keratitis in 2005–2006 through the possible vector of Bausch &amp; Lomb ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution)

===Amoebic===
* Acanthamoebic keratitis
:* Amoebic infection of the cornea is a serious corneal infection, most often affecting contact lens wearers. It is usually caused by &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;. On May 25, 2007, the U.S. Center for Disease Control issued a health advisory due to increased risk of &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; keratitis associated with use of Advanced Medical Optics Complete Moisture Plus Multi-Purpose eye solution.

===Parasitic===
* Onchocercal keratitis, which follows &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; infection by infected blackfly bite. These blackfly, &quot;Simulium&quot;, usually dwell near fast-flowing African streams, so the disease is also called &quot;river blindness&quot;.

Microbial keratitis (due to bacterial, fungal, or parasitic pathogens), as opposed to viral keratitis, is more commonly associated with the formation of corneal ulcers. Other risk factors for corneal ulcer formation include contact lens use, keratitis in the setting of eye trauma, underlying corneal disease or ocular surface diseases (such as severe chronic dry eye). Infectious keratitis sometimes presents as corneal edema, or with a hypopyon (a collection of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the eye).

==Classification (by stage of disease)==
* Superficial punctate keratitis
* Ulcerative keratitis

==Classification (by environmental aetiology)==
* Exposure keratitis (also known as exposure keratopathy) — due to dryness of the cornea caused by incomplete or inadequate eyelid closure (lagophthalmos).
* Photokeratitis — keratitis due to intense ultraviolet radiation exposure (e.g. snow blindness or welder&#x27;s arc eye.)
* Contact lens acute red eye (CLARE) — a non-ulcerative sterile keratitis associated with colonization of Gram-negative bacteria on contact lenses.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the cause of the keratitis. Infectious keratitis can progress rapidly, and generally requires urgent antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy to eliminate the pathogen. Antibacterial solutions include levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin. It is unclear if steroid eye drops are useful.

In addition, contact lens wearers are typically advised to discontinue contact lens wear and replace contaminated contact lenses and contact lens cases. (Contaminated lenses and cases should not be discarded as cultures from these can be used to identify the pathogen).

Topical ganciclovir or oral valacyclovir, famciclovir or acyclovir are used for HSV keratitis. Steroids should be avoided as application of steroids to a dendritic ulcer caused by HSV may result in rapid and significant worsening of the ulcer to form an &#x27;amoeboid&#x27; or &#x27;geographic&#x27; ulcer, so named because of the ulcer&#x27;s map like shape.

==Prevention==
In those who wear contact lenses, good lens hygiene and storage practices reduce the risk of keratitis. Specific lens care practices which may lead to infectious keratitis include wearing contact lenses overnight or in the shower, not replacing contact lens cases, storing lenses in tap water rather than contact lens solution and topping off lens solution rather than replacing it regularly. Improper lens storage may lead to bacterial biofilm formation in the contact lens case and subsequent colonization of the lenses by bacteria. Exposure of the lens to tap water through improper storage or use may lead to acanthamoeba infection, as the amoeba is commonly found in tap water.

Acyclovir prophylaxis has been found to reduce the risk of additional episodes of herpes simplex viral eye diseases (as well as oral or facial herpes) including a 50% reduction in the incidence of HSV keratitis. There was no rebound effect, or increased rate of HSV related eye disease upon stopping acyclovir prophylaxis.

==Prognosis==
Some infections may scar the cornea, thereby limiting vision. Others may result in perforation of the cornea, endophthalmitis (an infection inside the eye), or even loss of the eye. With proper medical attention, infections can usually be successfully treated without long-term visual loss.

Acanthamoebic and fungal keratitis are difficult to treat and are associated with a poor prognosis.

==In non-humans==
* Feline eosinophilic keratitis — affecting cats and horses; possibly initiated by feline herpesvirus 1 or other viral infection.

<text>In statistics, an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method to find (local) maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables. The EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the &quot;E&quot; step. These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step. It can be used, for example, to estimate a mixture of gaussians, or to solve the multiple linear regression problem.

== History ==
The EM algorithm was explained and given its name in a classic 1977 paper by Arthur Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin. They pointed out that the method had been &quot;proposed many times in special circumstances&quot; by earlier authors. One of the earliest is the gene-counting method for estimating allele frequencies by Cedric Smith. Another was proposed by H.O. Hartley in 1958, and Hartley and Hocking in 1977, from which many of the ideas in the Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper originated. Another one by S.K Ng, Thriyambakam Krishnan and G.J McLachlan in 1977. Hartley’s ideas can be broadened to any grouped discrete distribution. A very detailed treatment of the EM method for exponential families was published by Rolf Sundberg in his thesis and several papers, following his collaboration with Per Martin-Löf and Anders Martin-Löf. The Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper in 1977 generalized the method and sketched a convergence analysis for a wider class of problems. The Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper established the EM method as an important tool of statistical analysis. See also Meng and van Dyk (1997).

The convergence analysis of the Dempster–Laird–Rubin algorithm was flawed and a correct convergence analysis was published by C. F. Jeff Wu in 1983.
Wu&#x27;s proof established the EM method&#x27;s convergence also outside of the exponential family, as claimed by Dempster–Laird–Rubin.

== Introduction ==
The EM algorithm is used to find (local) maximum likelihood parameters of a statistical model in cases where the equations cannot be solved directly. Typically these models involve latent variables in addition to unknown parameters and known data observations. That is, either missing values exist among the data, or the model can be formulated more simply by assuming the existence of further unobserved data points. For example, a mixture model can be described more simply by assuming that each observed data point has a corresponding unobserved data point, or latent variable, specifying the mixture component to which each data point belongs.

Finding a maximum likelihood solution typically requires taking the derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to all the unknown values, the parameters and the latent variables, and simultaneously solving the resulting equations. In statistical models with latent variables, this is usually impossible. Instead, the result is typically a set of interlocking equations in which the solution to the parameters requires the values of the latent variables and vice versa, but substituting one set of equations into the other produces an unsolvable equation.

The EM algorithm proceeds from the observation that there is a way to solve these two sets of equations numerically. One can simply pick arbitrary values for one of the two sets of unknowns, use them to estimate the second set, then use these new values to find a better estimate of the first set, and then keep alternating between the two until the resulting values both converge to fixed points. It&#x27;s not obvious that this will work, but it can be proven in this context. Additionally, it can be proven that the derivative of the likelihood is (arbitrarily close to) zero at that point, which in turn means that the point is either a local maximum or a saddle point. In general, multiple maxima may occur, with no guarantee that the global maximum will be found. Some likelihoods also have singularities in them, i.e., nonsensical maxima. For example, one of the &quot;solutions&quot; that may be found by EM in a mixture model involves setting one of the components to have zero variance and the mean parameter for the same component to be equal to one of the data points.

== Description ==

=== The symbols ===
Given the statistical model which generates a set formula_1 of observed data, a set of unobserved latent data or missing values formula_2, and a vector of unknown parameters formula_3, along with a likelihood function formula_4, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the unknown parameters is determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed data

:formula_5

However, this quantity is often intractable since formula_2 is unobserved and the distribution of formula_2 is unknown before attaining formula_3.

=== The EM algorithm ===
The EM algorithm seeks to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the marginal likelihood by iteratively applying these two steps:
:&quot;Expectation step (E step)&quot;: Define formula_9 as the expected value of the log likelihood function of formula_3, with respect to the current conditional distribution of formula_2 given formula_1 and the current estimates of the parameters formula_13:
::formula_14

:&quot;Maximization step (M step)&quot;: Find the parameters that maximize this quantity:
::formula_15

More succinctly, we can write it as one equation:formula_16

=== Interpretation of the variables ===
The typical models to which EM is applied use formula_2 as a latent variable indicating membership in one of a set of groups:
#The observed data points formula_1 may be discrete (taking values in a finite or countably infinite set) or continuous (taking values in an uncountably infinite set). Associated with each data point may be a vector of observations.
#The missing values (aka latent variables) formula_2 are discrete, drawn from a fixed number of values, and with one latent variable per observed unit.
#The parameters are continuous, and are of two kinds: Parameters that are associated with all data points, and those associated with a specific value of a latent variable (i.e., associated with all data points whose corresponding latent variable has that value).
However, it is possible to apply EM to other sorts of models.

The motivation is as follows. If the value of the parameters formula_3 is known, usually the value of the latent variables formula_2 can be found by maximizing the log-likelihood over all possible values of formula_2, either simply by iterating over formula_2 or through an algorithm such as the Viterbi algorithm for hidden Markov models. Conversely, if we know the value of the latent variables formula_2, we can find an estimate of the parameters formula_3 fairly easily, typically by simply grouping the observed data points according to the value of the associated latent variable and averaging the values, or some function of the values, of the points in each group. This suggests an iterative algorithm, in the case where both formula_3 and formula_2 are unknown:
# First, initialize the parameters formula_3 to some random values.
# Compute the probability of each possible value of formula_2 , given formula_3.
# Then, use the just-computed values of formula_2 to compute a better estimate for the parameters formula_3.
# Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence.
The algorithm as just described monotonically approaches a local minimum of the cost function.

== Properties ==
Although an EM iteration does increase the observed data (i.e., marginal) likelihood function, no guarantee exists that the sequence converges to a maximum likelihood estimator. For multimodal distributions, this means that an EM algorithm may converge to a local maximum of the observed data likelihood function, depending on starting values. A variety of heuristic or metaheuristic approaches exist to escape a local maximum, such as random-restart hill climbing (starting with several different random initial estimates formula_13), or applying simulated annealing methods.

EM is especially useful when the likelihood is an exponential family, see Sundberg (2019, Ch. 8) for a comprehensive treatment: the E step becomes the sum of expectations of sufficient statistics, and the M step involves maximizing a linear function. In such a case, it is usually possible to derive closed-form expression updates for each step, using the Sundberg formula (proved and published by Rolf Sundberg, based on unpublished results of Per Martin-Löf and Anders Martin-Löf).

The EM method was modified to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for Bayesian inference in the original paper by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin.

Other methods exist to find maximum likelihood estimates, such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient, or variants of the Gauss–Newton algorithm. Unlike EM, such methods typically require the evaluation of first and/or second derivatives of the likelihood function.

== Proof of correctness ==
Expectation-Maximization works to improve formula_9 rather than directly improving formula_35. Here it is shown that improvements to the former imply improvements to the latter.

For any formula_2 with non-zero probability formula_37, we can write
: formula_38
We take the expectation over possible values of the unknown data formula_2 under the current parameter estimate formula_40 by multiplying both sides by formula_41 and summing (or integrating) over formula_2. The left-hand side is the expectation of a constant, so we get:
: formula_43
where formula_44 is defined by the negated sum it is replacing.
This last equation holds for every value of formula_3 including formula_46,
: formula_47
and subtracting this last equation from the previous equation gives
: formula_48
However, Gibbs&#x27; inequality tells us that formula_49, so we can conclude that
: formula_50
In words, choosing formula_3 to improve formula_9 causes formula_35 to improve at least as much.

== As a maximization–maximization procedure ==
The EM algorithm can be viewed as two alternating maximization steps, that is, as an example of coordinate descent. Consider the function:
:formula_54 
where &quot;q&quot; is an arbitrary probability distribution over the unobserved data &quot;z&quot; and &quot;H(q)&quot; is the entropy of the distribution &quot;q&quot;. This function can be written as
:formula_55
where formula_56 is the conditional distribution of the unobserved data given the observed data formula_57 and formula_58 is the Kullback–Leibler divergence.

Then the steps in the EM algorithm may be viewed as:
:&quot;Expectation step&quot;: Choose formula_59 to maximize formula_60:
::formula_61
:&quot;Maximization step&quot;: Choose formula_62 to maximize formula_60:
::formula_64

== Applications ==
*EM is frequently used for parameter estimation of mixed models, notably in quantitative genetics.
*In psychometrics, EM is an important tool for estimating item parameters and latent abilities of item response theory models.
*With the ability to deal with missing data and observe unidentified variables, EM is becoming a useful tool to price and manage risk of a portfolio.
*The EM algorithm (and its faster variant ordered subset expectation maximization) is also widely used in medical image reconstruction, especially in positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and x-ray computed tomography. See below for other faster variants of EM.
*In structural engineering, the Structural Identification using Expectation Maximization (STRIDE) algorithm is an output-only method for identifying natural vibration properties of a structural system using sensor data (see Operational Modal Analysis).
*EM is also used for data clustering. In natural language processing, two prominent instances of the algorithm are the Baum–Welch algorithm for hidden Markov models, and the inside-outside algorithm for unsupervised induction of probabilistic context-free grammars.
*In the analysis of intertrade waiting times i.e. the time between subsequent trades in shares of stock at a stock exchange the EM algorithm has proved to be very useful.

== Filtering and smoothing EM algorithms ==
A Kalman filter is typically used for on-line state estimation and a minimum-variance smoother may be employed for off-line or batch state estimation. However, these minimum-variance solutions require estimates of the state-space model parameters. EM algorithms can be used for solving joint state and parameter estimation problems.

Filtering and smoothing EM algorithms arise by repeating this two-step procedure:

;E-step
: Operate a Kalman filter or a minimum-variance smoother designed with current parameter estimates to obtain updated state estimates.

;M-step
: Use the filtered or smoothed state estimates within maximum-likelihood calculations to obtain updated parameter estimates.

Suppose that a Kalman filter or minimum-variance smoother operates on measurements of a single-input-single-output system that possess additive white noise. An updated measurement noise variance estimate can be obtained from the maximum likelihood calculation
: formula_65

where formula_66 are scalar output estimates calculated by a filter or a smoother from N scalar measurements formula_67. The above update can also be applied to updating a Poisson measurement noise intensity. Similarly, for a first-order auto-regressive process, an updated process noise variance estimate can be calculated by
: formula_68

where formula_66 and formula_70 are scalar state estimates calculated by a filter or a smoother. The updated model coefficient estimate is obtained via
: formula_71

The convergence of parameter estimates such as those above are well studied.

== Variants ==
A number of methods have been proposed to accelerate the sometimes slow convergence of the EM algorithm, such as those using conjugate gradient and modified Newton&#x27;s methods (Newton–Raphson). Also, EM can be used with constrained estimation methods.

&quot;Parameter-expanded expectation maximization (PX-EM)&quot; algorithm often provides speed up by &quot;us[ing] a `covariance adjustment&#x27; to correct the analysis of the M step, capitalising on extra information captured in the imputed complete data&quot;.

&quot;Expectation conditional maximization (ECM)&quot; replaces each M step with a sequence of conditional maximization (CM) steps in which each parameter &quot;θ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is maximized individually, conditionally on the other parameters remaining fixed. Itself can be extended into the &quot;Expectation conditional maximization either (ECME)&quot; algorithm.

This idea is further extended in &quot;generalized expectation maximization (GEM)&quot; algorithm, in which is sought only an increase in the objective function &quot;F&quot; for both the E step and M step as described in the As a maximization–maximization procedure section. GEM is further developed in a distributed environment and shows promising results.

It is also possible to consider the EM algorithm as a subclass of the MM (Majorize/Minimize or Minorize/Maximize, depending on context) algorithm, and therefore use any machinery developed in the more general case.

=== α-EM algorithm ===
The Q-function used in the EM algorithm is based on the log likelihood. Therefore, it is regarded as the log-EM algorithm. The use of the log likelihood can be generalized to that of the α-log likelihood ratio. Then, the α-log likelihood ratio of the observed data can be exactly expressed as equality by using the Q-function of the α-log likelihood ratio and the α-divergence. Obtaining this Q-function is a generalized E step. Its maximization is a generalized M step. This pair is called the α-EM algorithm
which contains the log-EM algorithm as its subclass. Thus, the α-EM algorithm by Yasuo Matsuyama is an exact generalization of the log-EM algorithm. No computation of gradient or Hessian matrix is needed. The α-EM shows faster convergence than the log-EM algorithm by choosing an appropriate α. The α-EM algorithm leads to a faster version of the Hidden Markov model estimation algorithm α-HMM.
== Relation to variational Bayes methods ==
EM is a partially non-Bayesian, maximum likelihood method. Its final result gives a probability distribution over the latent variables (in the Bayesian style) together with a point estimate for &quot;θ&quot; (either a maximum likelihood estimate or a posterior mode). A fully Bayesian version of this may be wanted, giving a probability distribution over &quot;θ&quot; and the latent variables. The Bayesian approach to inference is simply to treat &quot;θ&quot; as another latent variable. In this paradigm, the distinction between the E and M steps disappears. If using the factorized Q approximation as described above (variational Bayes), solving can iterate over each latent variable (now including &quot;θ&quot;) and optimize them one at a time. Now, &quot;k&quot; steps per iteration are needed, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of latent variables. For graphical models this is easy to do as each variable&#x27;s new &quot;Q&quot; depends only on its Markov blanket, so local message passing can be used for efficient inference.

== Geometric interpretation ==

In information geometry, the E step and the M step are interpreted as projections under dual affine connections, called the e-connection and the m-connection; the Kullback–Leibler divergence can also be understood in these terms.

== Examples ==
=== Gaussian mixture === 


Let formula_72 be a sample of formula_73 independent observations from a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions of dimension formula_74, and let formula_75 be the latent variables that determine the component from which the observation originates.
: formula_76 and formula_77
where
: formula_78 and formula_79

The aim is to estimate the unknown parameters representing the &quot;mixing&quot; value between the Gaussians and the means and covariances of each:
: formula_80
where the incomplete-data likelihood function is
: formula_81

and the complete-data likelihood function is
: formula_82

or

: formula_83

where formula_84 is an indicator function and formula_85 is the probability density function of a multivariate normal.

In the last equality, for each , one indicator formula_86 is equal to zero, and one indicator is equal to one. The inner sum thus reduces to one term.

==== E step ====
Given our current estimate of the parameters &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), the conditional distribution of the &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot; is determined by Bayes theorem to be the proportional height of the normal density weighted by &quot;τ&quot;:
: formula_87

These are called the &quot;membership probabilities&quot;, which are normally considered the output of the E step (although this is not the Q function of below).

This E step corresponds with setting up this function for Q:
: formula_88
The expectation of formula_89 inside the sum is taken with respect to the probability density function formula_90, which might be different for each formula_91 of the training set. Everything in the E step is known before the step is taken except formula_92, which is computed according to the equation at the beginning of the E step section.

This full conditional expectation does not need to be calculated in one step, because &quot;τ&quot; and μ/Σ appear in separate linear terms and can thus be maximized independently.

==== M step ====
formula_93 being quadratic in form means that determining the maximizing values of formula_62 is relatively straightforward. Also, formula_95, formula_96 and formula_97 may all be maximized independently since they all appear in separate linear terms.

To begin, consider formula_95, which has the constraint formula_99:
: formula_100
This has the same form as the maximum likelihood estimate for the binomial distribution, so
: formula_101

For the next estimates of formula_96:
: formula_103
This has the same form as a weighted maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution, so
: formula_104 and formula_105
and, by symmetry,
: formula_106 and formula_107

==== Termination ====

Conclude the iterative process if formula_108 for formula_109 below some preset threshold.
==== Generalization ====
The algorithm illustrated above can be generalized for mixtures of more than two multivariate normal distributions.

=== Truncated and censored regression ===
The EM algorithm has been implemented in the case where an underlying linear regression model exists explaining the variation of some quantity, but where the values actually observed are censored or truncated versions of those represented in the model. Special cases of this model include censored or truncated observations from one normal distribution.

== Alternatives ==
EM typically converges to a local optimum, not necessarily the global optimum, with no bound on the convergence rate in general. It is possible that it can be arbitrarily poor in high dimensions and there can be an exponential number of local optima. Hence, a need exists for alternative methods for guaranteed learning, especially in the high-dimensional setting. Alternatives to EM exist with better guarantees for consistency, which are termed &quot;moment-based approaches&quot; or the so-called &quot;spectral techniques&quot;. Moment-based approaches to learning the parameters of a probabilistic model enjoy guarantees such as global convergence under certain conditions unlike EM which is often plagued by the issue of getting stuck in local optima. Algorithms with guarantees for learning can be derived for a number of important models such as mixture models, HMMs etc. For these spectral methods, no spurious local optima occur, and the true parameters can be consistently estimated under some regularity conditions.

<doc id="470754" wikidata="Q723042" url="?curid=470754" title="Teinosuke Kinugasa">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker and actor. His best-known films include the silent avant-garde films &quot;A Page of Madness&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot; and the Academy Award-winning historical drama &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;.

==Biography==
Kinugasa was born in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture. He began his career as an onnagata (actor specializing in female roles) at the Nikkatsu studio. When Japanese cinema began using actresses in the early 1920s, he switched to directing and worked for producers such as Shozo Makino, before becoming independent to make his best-known film, &quot;A Page of Madness&quot; (1926). It was considered lost for 45 years until the director rediscovered it in his shed in 1971. A silent film, Kinugasa released it with a new print and score to world acclaim. He also directed the film &quot;Crossroads&quot; in 1928. He directed jidaigeki at the Shochiku studios, where he helped establish the career of Chōjirō Hayashi (later known as Kazuo Hasegawa). After the war, he helmed big-budget costume productions for Daiei studios. &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; received the Palme d&#x27;or at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.

On 26 February 1982, Kinugasa died in Kyoto at the age of 86.

<doc id="470759" wikidata="Q3654602" url="?curid=470759" title="Camp Concentration">
<text>Camp Concentration is a 1968 science fiction novel by American author Thomas M. Disch. After being serialized in &quot;New Worlds&quot; in 1967, it was published by Hart-Davis in the UK in 1968 and by Doubleday in the US in 1969. Translations have been published in Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Serbian and Polish. 
The book is set during a war, projected from the Vietnam War, in which the United States is apparently criminally involved (it is noted at one point that the US is waging germ warfare in &quot;the so-called neutral countries&quot;). The President of the United States during this fictional war is Robert McNamara.

==Plot summary==
In Part I, poet, lapsed Catholic and conscientious objector Louis Sacchetti is sent to a secret military installation called Camp Archimedes, where military prisoners are injected with a form of syphilis intended to make them geniuses (hence the punning reference to &quot;concentration&quot; in the novel&#x27;s title). By breaking down rigid categories in the mind (according to a definition of genius put forward by Arthur Koestler), the disease makes the thought process both faster and more flexible; it also causes physical breakdown and, within nine months, death.

The book is told in the form of Sacchetti&#x27;s diary, and includes literary references to the story of Faust (at one point the prisoners stage Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and Sacchetti&#x27;s friendship with ringleader Mordecai Washington parallels Faust&#x27;s with Mephistopheles). It only becomes clear that Sacchetti himself has syphilis as his diary entries refer to his increasingly poor health, and become progressively more florid, until almost descending into insanity.

In Part II, after a test run on the prisoners, a megalomaniac nuclear physicist has himself injected with the disease, joins Camp Archimedes with his team of student helpers, and sets about trying to end the human race.

The prisoners in the book appear to be fascinated by alchemy, which they used as an elaborate cover for their escape plans. Sacchetti, who is obese, has a number of ironic visions involving other obese historical and intellectual figures, such as Thomas Aquinas.

==Allusions and sources==
The book is seen as an example of New Wave modernism. In addition to the staging of Marlowe&#x27;s play, the book alludes to Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, which is about a composer named Adrian Leverkühn who intentionally contracts syphilis.
Disch&#x27;s book mentions a female composer named Adrienne Leverkuhn.

<text>The Belt Parkway is the name given to a series of controlled-access parkways that form a belt-like circle around the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. The Belt Parkway comprises three of the four parkways in what is known as the Belt System: the Shore Parkway, the Southern Parkway (not to be confused with the Southern State Parkway), and the Laurelton Parkway. The three parkways in the Belt Parkway are a combined in length. The Cross Island Parkway makes up the fourth parkway in the system, but is signed separately.

==Route description==
The Shore Parkway, Southern Parkway, Laurelton Parkway, and Cross Island Parkway are collectively known as the &quot;Belt System&quot;. The four components of the Belt System are designated as New York State Route 907C (NY 907C), NY 907D, NY 907B, and NY 907A, respectively, by the New York State Department of Transportation. All four numbers are reference route designations and are not signed. Excluding the Cross Island Parkway, the other three segments are now known collectively as the official &quot;Belt Parkway&quot;. It is designated an east–west route, and its exit numbering system begins, in standard fashion, at the western terminus of the Shore Parkway, the westernmost parkway in the system. The numbering increases as the parkway proceeds eastward, and continues onto the Cross Island at the eastern terminus of the Belt Parkway. The north–south parkway retains the numbering scheme to its northern terminus.

===Shore Parkway===

The Belt Parkway begins at an interchange (exit 22) with the Gowanus Expressway in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. Paralleling Third Avenue, the parkway turns west and crosses over the Long Island Rail Road Bay Ridge Branch, a freight-only line. Bypassing Bay Ridge, the Belt passes exit 1, which services 65th–67th Streets in Bay Ridge. Crossing south past Owl&#x27;s Head Park, the parkway turns southward and enters Shore Road Park, paralleling the shore of the Upper New York Bay. The eastbound lanes of the Belt Parkway pass several small parking areas that serve as viewing spots for the bay. Connections across the parkway to Bay Ridge are also present at these parking areas. Beginning the bend to the southeast, the parkway passes Andrew Lehman Field.

Just east of the field, the Belt Parkway comes within the shadows of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and passes exit 2, which serves as the southern terminus of Fourth Avenue. After crossing under the bridge, the westbound lanes enter exit 3 which connects to the Verrazzano. Eastbound, the lanes from the bridge connecting to the Belt merge in, as the road enters Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course. During a short gap away from the shore, the Belt passes a parking area for Dyker Beach Park, entering exit 4, which services Bay 8th Street and 14th Avenue. Continuing along the park, the Belt begins to parallel Cropsey Avenue and passes another parking area before reaching exit 5, a junction with Bay Parkway. This marks the eastern end of Dyker Beach Park, and the route begins to parallel shoreline strip malls before reaching Calvert Vaux Park.

Now in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, the Belt passes exit 6, which connects to Cropsey Avenue. Westbound, this junction is split into exit 6N and exit 6S, also serving Stillwell Avenue. The parkway bends eastward and crosses over the Coney Island Complex, a large railroad yard for the New York City Subway. Just before passing exit 7, the eastbound lanes cross just north of the Neptune Avenue subway station. Exit 7 eastbound services Ocean Parkway, which is met by exit 7B proceeding westbound. Westbound, exit 7A services Shell Road in Gravesend. Paralleling the namesake Neptune Avenue, the parkway enters Sheepshead Bay and connections to Coney Island.

At exit 8, the Belt Parkway connects to Coney Island Avenue, approaching the namesake bay as it continues east. Paralleling Emmons Avenue through Sheepshead Bay, the parkway passes exit 9A eastbound, which connects to Knapp Street and exit 9B, which is a ramp to the eastern end of Emmons Avenue. Westbound, exit 9 services Knapp Street. Crossing south of Gerritsen Beach, the parkway passes south of the Plum Beach Channel and passes a small rest area on the eastbound lanes. Turning northeast through the Floyd Bennett Field area, the parkway bends north and passes a service area with gas services in the median. Just north of the service area, the Belt passes exit 11N–S, a cloverleaf interchange which connects to Flatbush Avenue and the Rockaways.
After exit 11N, the Belt Parkway continues east through Floyd Bennett Field, crossing over the Mill Basin Drawbridge into Brooklyn Beach and passes the entrance to the Jamaica Bay Riding Academy, the only business served directly on the parkway. Crossing over another bridge, the parkway enters the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. The parkway, now running northeast, parallels a bicycle path, reaching Canarsie Pier and exit 13, which serves as the southern end of Rockaway Parkway. Crossing over another bridge over Spring Creek, the parkway passes exit 14, which connects to Pennsylvania Avenue in Starrett City. The interchange is adjacent to the former Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill. After crossing another waterway, Hendrix Creek, the Belt passes the former Fountain Avenue Landfill and passes exit 15, a diamond interchange with Erskine Street leading to the Gateway Center shopping complex.

Now crossing over the Old Mill Basin section of Jamaica Bay, the Belt Parkway continues northeast in the borough of Queens, entering exit 17N–S, Cross Bay Boulevard and Cohancy Street, which also connects to the Cross Bay Bridge and towards the Rockaways. Crossing into an interchange with NY 27, the parkway travels under the IND Rockaway Line () and passes exit 18B, which connects to Aqueduct Racetrack in Ozone Park.

=== Southern and Laurelton Parkways ===
Now on the Southern Parkway section of the Belt, the Belt continues eastward into exit 19, which connects to NY 878 (the Nassau Expressway) and indirectly with I-678, the Van Wyck Expressway. This interchange also serves as access to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Now with North and South Conduit Avenues serving as westbound and eastbound frontage roads for the parkway, passing exit 20, a junction with the JFK Expressway and the airport. Crossing under the Van Wyck, the Belt continues east through multiple underpasses and overpasses before reaching exit 21A, westbound side, which services 150th Street and Rockaway Boulevard. Crossing under Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, the Belt passes exit 21B, which connects to Farmers Boulevard and Guy R. Brewer Boulevard.

Exit 22 services Springfield Boulevard, where the Belt Parkway begins to parallel a Long Island Rail Road line through Laurelton. Westbound, exit 23A services North Conduit Boulevard (NY 27) and 225th Street, while eastbound, exit 23B services NY 27 and the Sunrise Highway. At this junction, the parkway turns northeast and joins the Laurelton Parkway segment, which connects to exit 24A, Merrick Boulevard (also known as Floyd H. Flake Boulevard) in both directions, and Francis Lewis Boulevard on the eastbound lanes. Exit 24B on the eastbound lanes connects also to Merrick Boulevard and 130th Avenue and on the westbound lanes connect Francis Lewis Boulevard. Just after crossing under 130th Avenue, the Belt passes exit 25A–B. At this interchange, the Laurelton Parkway segment ends, with exit 25A connecting to the western terminus of the Southern State Parkway and exit 25B servicing Elmont Road.

At this interchange, the Belt Parkway crosses over the Southern State and becomes the Cross Island Parkway, which continues north through Queens, connecting to I-495, the Grand Central Parkway and eventually I-678, the Whitestone Expressway.

==History==
=== Proposal ===

The Belt Parkway was proposed by public official and highway advocate Robert Moses on February 25, 1930 to provide highway access to Manhattan and to connect to, and use similar design principles to, parkways already constructed on Long Island and Westchester County, New York. At the time, the Belt project was referred to as the &quot;Marginal Boulevard&quot;. The Belt system was part of a &quot;Metropolitan Loop&quot; running through all five boroughs of New York City as well as New Jersey, proposed by the Regional Plan Association in 1929. Other highways proposed in this loop included the future Cross Bronx Expressway and Staten Island Expressway.

In a 1937 report titled &quot;New Parkways in New York City&quot;, the New York City Parks Department proposed the Belt Parkway in the following outline:

=== Construction ===

Construction began in 1934. New highway designs were implemented, including dark main roads and lighter-colored entrance and exit ramps. The parkway first opened on June 29, 1940, with most of Cross Island, Southern, and Shore Parkway sections completed. A bike path along the Southern Brooklyn section of the Belt Parkway opened in 1941.

The construction of Belt Parkway entailed:
* of hydraulic fill pumped
* of dry fill moved
* of pavement used
* of concrete used
* of masonry used
* of piles used
* of steel used
* 9,000 men employed

All the original parkways, except the Gowanus, were built on grassy rights-of-way with trees, in a more green surrounding than most highways of their time. To build sections between exits 7 and 8 in the 1930s parts of Coney Island Creek were filled in, finishing the process, begun over a decade before construction began, of turning Coney Island from an island into a peninsula. The Gowanus Parkway, in part replacing the demolished Fifth Avenue Line, was built as an elevated structure over Third and Hamilton Avenues in order to avoid the active docks and industrial areas including Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

Like most parkways in New York State, the parkways comprising the Belt System were closed to commercial traffic, including any vehicle with a non-passenger registration and all commercial trucking of any size. Originally even station wagons, which had &quot;suburban&quot; registrations, were excluded but they were later allowed, along with passenger-registered SUVs and vans.

=== Completed system ===
The Belt Parkway formed the southern portion of a system of parkways and highways that connected every borough except Staten Island. At its eastern end, the Belt Parkway became the Cross Island Parkway, which connected to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge and the Hutchinson River Parkway in the east Bronx. At its western end, the Belt Parkway led to the Gowanus Parkway, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, the West Side Elevated Highway, and the Henry Hudson Parkway to the west Bronx. The Henry Hudson and Hutchinson River parkways were connected in the Bronx via Van Cortlandt Park, Mosholu Parkway, and Pelham Parkway, all of which were service-level roads. Some portions of the original system were converted to expressways, which could be used by commercial traffic. The Gowanus Expressway replaced the Gowanus Parkway in 1950 and became part of the Interstate Highway System as I-278. The Whitestone Parkway was expanded into the Whitestone Expressway starting in 1957; it also became an Interstate Highway and is signed as part of I-678. In the late 1940s, the parkway was widened in its entirety.

In 1969, the New York City Council co-named the Belt Parkway &quot;Leif Ericson Drive&quot; between exit 2 and exit 9, to recognize the large Scandinavian population in Bay Ridge. By 1970, signage on much of the parkway&#x27;s length (except for the Cross Island Parkway section) had been replaced by signs reading &quot;Belt Parkway&quot;. The segment of NY 27A that ran concurrently with the parkway was removed in 1972. In the 1980s, the viaduct carrying traffic over the Coney Island Yard was reconstructed. In September 2002, Exit 15 was opened to serve the nearby Gateway Center commercial development. in 2005, a project to reconstruct Exit 17 was competed. The old cloverleaf interchange was demolished, and a new Diamond interchange with wider deacceleration lanes and gentler turns was constructed in its place.

In October 2009, NYCDOT launched the first phase of a capital project to reconstruct seven obsolete bridges along the Belt Parkway. The first phase included the reconstruction of an overpass ramp from Guider Avenue, as well as the replacement of the Paerdegat Basin and Rockaway Parkway bridges, which was completed in 2012. In 2021, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority proposed widening a section of the Belt Parkway near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

<text>Viscount Exmouth, of Canonteign in the County of Devon, is a title in the peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The title was created in 1816 for the prominent naval officer Edward Pellew, 1st Baron Exmouth. He had already been created a baronet in the baronetage of Great Britain on 18 March 1796 for rescuing the crew of the East Indiaman &quot;Dutton&quot;. After a succession of commands culminating as Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, he was created Baron Exmouth, of Canonteign in the County of Devon, in the peerage of the United Kingdom in 1814. He was advanced as a Viscount, with the same designation, for the successful bombardment of Algiers in 1816, which secured the release of the 1,000 Christian slaves in the city.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Viscount, who represented Launceston in Parliament. On the death in 1922 of the second Viscount&#x27;s great-grandson, the fifth Viscount, this line of the family failed. He was succeeded by his 94-year-old first cousin twice removed, the sixth Viscount. He was the son of the Hon. and Very Revd George Pellew, Dean of Norwich, third son of the first Viscount. Partly due to having become a U.S. citizen, and partly due to his advanced age, the sixth Viscount did not use his title for the brief period he held it, nor did he claim his seat in the House of Lords. Only six months after succeeding to his titles, the sixth Viscount died. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Viscount, a naturalised U.S. citizen and professor of chemistry. Having succeeded to the peerage, the seventh Viscount returned to England in 1923 and again became a British subject, taking his seat in the House of Lords in 1931. Upon his death without any surviving issue in 1945, this line of the family also failed.

The title then passed to the seventh Viscount&#x27;s second cousin, the eighth Viscount. He was the grandson of the Hon. and Revd Edward Pellew, fourth son of the first Viscount. His son, the ninth Viscount, married María Luisa de Urquijo y Losada, Marquesa de Olías, a title of Spanish nobility created by King Philip IV in 1652. They were succeeded in their respective titles by their son, Paul Pellew, as 10th Viscount Exmouth and 9th Marquess of Olías.

The family seat was Canonteign House, near Exeter in Devon.

<text>An Interoperable Object Reference (IOR) is a CORBA or RMI-IIOP reference that uniquely identifies an object on a remote CORBA server.

IORs can be transmitted in binary over TCP/IP via the General Inter-ORB Protocol (the encoding may be big-endian or little-endian), or serialized into a string of hexadecimal digits (prefixed by the string &quot;codice_1&quot;) to facilitate transport by non-CORBA mechanisms such as HTTP, FTP, and e-mail.

The internal structure of an IOR may contain multiple components. Each component is identified by its integer code and has its binary format. Object Management Group assigns the codes. The typical IOR normally contains: 

* the IP address of the remote host, 
* the number of the remote port on that the CORBA server is listening, 
* a string defining the class of the remote object on which the methods will be invoked, and 
* the object key that is used by the server ORB to identify the object.

It is possible to register special objects (IOR interceptors) that can add the needed specific components to the IOR being created by the particular ORB.</text><links>

<text>The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation (MHA Nation), also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes (Mandan: &quot;Miiti Naamni&quot;; Hidatsa: &quot;Awadi Aguraawi&quot;; Arikara: &quot;ačitaanu&#x27; táWIt&quot;), is a federally recognized Native American Nation resulting from the alliance of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara peoples, whose Indigenous lands ranged across the Missouri River basin extending from present day North Dakota through western Montana and Wyoming.

After the signing of the Fort Laramie Treaty (1851) and subsequent taking of land, the Nation&#x27;s land base is currently approximately 1 million acres located in Fort Berthold Reservation in northwestern North Dakota. The Tribe reported a total enrollment of 17,492 enrolled members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation as of December 2024. Nearly 5,600 live on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation; others live and work elsewhere.

==History==
=== Formation of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation ===
The Mandan and Hidatsa tribes formed an alliance after the smallpox epidemic of 1837–1838 decimated the Mandan, leaving approximately 125 survivors. The Mandan subsequently banded together with the Hidatsa to survive. In 1845 the Mandan and Hidatsa jointly established a new town, Like-a-Fishhook Village. 

In 1862, the Arikara settled with the Mandan and Hidatsa at Like-a-Fishhook to escape war with the Lakota, forming a confederacy that would later be known as the Three Affiliated Tribes. The Nation now commonly refers to itself as the &quot;Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation&quot; in most situations although &quot;The Three Affiliated Tribes&quot; is used as well.

Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the tribes formed a tribal government which they called the Three Affiliated Tribes, a sovereign tribal nation. 

=== Tribal history ===

==== Mandan ====
The Mandan, who refer to themselves as Nueta, are a Native American tribe currently part of the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota. At the height of their historic culture, the Mandan were prosperous and peaceful farmers and traders, noted for their excellent maize cultivation and crafting of Knife River flint. They built earth lodges, and made villages of considerable technical skill, and cultivated many varieties of maize. They were a more sedentary people than other, more nomadic tribes of the Great Plains.

Lewis and Clark stayed with the Mandan when they passed through the Upper Missouri region on their expedition to the Northwest, including five months in the winter of 1804–1805. Sakakawea, a Hidatsa who has subsequently been claimed by both the Shoshone and Hidatsa, joined the expedition as an interpreter and native guide. Because of her role in salvaging the expedition, she was honored with an image on the U.S. dollar coin. On the return trip, the expedition brought the Mandan chief Sheheke Shote with them back to Washington, DC.

Some explorers described the Mandan and their structures as having &quot;European&quot; features. In the 19th century, a few people used such anecdotes to speculate that the Mandan were, in part, descended from lost European settlers who had arrived at North America before 1492, the voyage of Christopher Columbus. One legend associated them with having Welsh ancestry. Historians and anthropologists have debated this history; however, the MHA people and their oral tradition agree that there was historic admixture. This is the legend of &quot;Madoc ab Owein&quot;, popularized in relation to the Mandan in the 19th century by the painter George Catlin. The current center of Mandan culture and population is the community of Twin Buttes, North Dakota.

==== Hidatsa ====
The Hidatsa, called &quot;Moennitarri&quot; by their allies the Mandan, are a Siouan-speaking people. The Hidatsa name for themselves (autonym) is &quot;Nuxbaaga&quot; (&quot;Original People&quot;). The name Hidatsa said to mean &quot;willows,&quot; was that of one band&#x27;s village, after a prominent landscape feature. When the villages consolidated, the tribe used that name for their people as a whole.

Their language is related to that of the Crow nation. They have been considered a parent tribe to the modern Crow in Montana. The Hidatsa have sometimes been confused with the &quot;Gros Ventre,&quot; another tribe which was historically in Montana. In 1936, the Bureau of Indian Affairs compiled the Tribe&#x27;s Base Roll listing all Hidatsa as &quot;G.V.&quot;, for Gros Ventre. Today about 30 full-blood Hidatsa are members of the Affiliated Three Tribes. Most Hidatsa people have ancestry also of the Mandan and Arikara tribes.

==== Arikara ====
The Arikara call themselves Sahnish. The Arikara were forced into Mandan territory by conflict with the Lakota (Sioux), between the Arikara War and the European-American settlement in the 1870s. The Arikara lived for many years near the Fort Clark trading post, also called Knife River.

In 1862 they joined the Hidatsa and Mandan at Like-a-Fishhook Village, near the Fort Berthold trading post. For work, the Arikara men scouted for the U. S. Army, stationed at nearby Fort Stevenson. In 1874, the Arikara scouts guided Custer on the Black Hills Expedition, during which his party discovered gold. This resulted in a rush of miners to the area, causing conflict with the Lakota, who considered the Black Hills to be sacred.

In 1876, a large group of Arikara men accompanied Custer and the 7th Cavalry on the Little Big Horn Expedition. Arikara scouts were in the lead when US Army forces attacked the widespread encampment of thousands of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors and families. Several scouts drove off Lakota horses, as they had been ordered, and others fought alongside the troopers. Three Arikara men were killed: Little Brave, Bobtail Bull, and Bloody Knife. During the subsequent confusion, when the scouts were cut off from the troopers, they returned to the base camp as they had been directed. After the battle, in which Custer and some 260 other US troops were killed, the search for scapegoats resulted in some critics mistakenly accusing the scouts of having abandoned the soldiers.

== Land base ==

=== Tribal reorganization ===
The United States issued two executive orders in 1870 and 1880 that diminished the land base of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara by approximately 80% to make way for a new railroad. Their land was again reduced a further 60% in 1886 when the Fort Berthold Reservation was established. In all, about 11.4 million acres of tribal lands were taken.

Following the creation of the contemporary Fort Berthold Reservation in 1886, the Bureau of Indian Affairs forced tribal members to leave Like-a-Fishhook Village and take up individual allotments. The stated purpose of the reservation was to enable the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara &quot;to obtain the means necessary to enable them to become wholly self-supporting by the cultivation of the soil and other pursuits of husbandry.&quot;

Tribal leaders spent three decades petitioning the United States government to receive fair compensation for the lands ceded by the executive orders of 1870 and 1880. The tribe was eventually awarded $2.2 million as compensation in 1930.

Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the tribes formed a tribal government which they called the Three Affiliated Tribes, a sovereign tribal nation.

The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation consists of , of which are owned by Native Americans, either as individual allotments or communally by the tribe.

=== Garrison Dam ===
In response to severe flooding on the lower Missouri River in 1943, Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1944 and authorized the creation of the Garrison Dam. 

In order to construct the dam, the US government needed to purchase 152,000 acres of agricultural land in the Fort Berthold Reservation that would be flooded by the creation of Lake Sakakawea. Threatened by confiscation under eminent domain, the tribes were forced to accept $5 million in exchange for their lands. This amount was increased to $7.5 million in 1949, but it hardly compensated for the loss of 94% of the tribe’s agricultural land.

The majority of tribal members were forced to relocate far-flung, unproductive parcels of land. The construction of Garrison Dam almost totally destroyed the traditional way of life for the Three Affiliated Tribes and made them much more dependent on the federal government.

The tribe petitioned the government for decades to receive compensation for the unjust taking of their land. In 1992, Congress awarded the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation over $149.2 million and over of land in just compensation for wrongs imposed on the tribal people by the Garrison Dam.

== Membership/Citizenship qualifications ==
There are 17,228 enrolled members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation as of 16 June 2023. Approximately 2/3rd reside off the Reservation and 1/3rd live on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation;.

Membership (citizenship) is derived from the 1936 Indian Census roll of the Three Affiliated Tribes. On 2 November 2010 the tribal membership passed amendments specifying &quot;blood quantum,&quot; or minimum amounts of tribal ancestry to qualify individuals for membership and for candidates for public office. Effective 16 December 2010 individuals must possess at least 1/8th degree blood of the Mandan, Hidatsa, or Arikara ancestry (the equivalent of one full-blooded great-grandparent) to become an enrolled member of the MHA Nation and 1/4th degree blood of the Mandan, Hidatsa, or Arikara ancestry to run for the Tribal Business Council.

==Economy==

The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation sits atop the Bakken Formation, the second most-productive geographic area for shale oil production in the United States. The nation receives roughly 90 percent of its revenue from royalties and taxes on oil and gas development. In 2023, the nation bought an idle from Enbridge to help deliver oil from the wells. The pipeline runs from the Plaza/Wabek fields to Enbridge’s terminal in Stanley.

===Tribal Business Council===
The Tribal Business Council consists of six Segment Representatives and a chairman. Each member&#x27;s term lasts 4 years, and there are no term limits. The Tribal Business Council holds Regular Meetings on the second Thursday of each month, and sub-committees meet at different times throughout the month. A legal quorum as defined in the constitution of the Three Affiliated Tribes is 5 of the 7 council representatives.

<text>Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (4 July 1924 – 23 December 1993) was an Icelandic religious leader and singer of rímur who was instrumental in gaining the Icelandic government&#x27;s recognition of pre-Christian Heathenry in the country.

== Biography ==
Sveinbjörn lived his entire life in West Iceland Borgarfjörður. From 1944 on, he was a sheep farmer while also pursuing literary interests on the side. He published a book of rímur in 1945, a textbook on the verse forms of rímur in 1953, two volumes of his own verse in 1957 and 1976, and edited several anthologies. He was married to Svanfríður Hagvaag with whom he had two sons, born in 1965 and 1966.

The Ásatrúarfélagið (&quot;Fellowship of Æsir faith&quot;), which he co-founded in 1972, and for which he acted as &quot;allsherjargoði&quot;, was officially recognised as a religious body in 1973.

Sveinbjörn is regarded with much respect and affection amongst Germanic neopagans. He was not only well known as a rímur singer, or kvæðamaður, in Iceland but also attracted fans and audiences throughout Europe and North America. He sometimes performed at rock concerts and is the opening act in the film Rokk í Reykjavík, directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. Sveinbjörn can be heard singing on the bootleg album &quot;Ragnarok (A New Beginning)&quot; by Burzum, on the last track of the album entitled &quot;Hávamál&quot;.
In 1978, Sveinbjörn appeared on the television program In Search Of in an episode on &quot;Lost Vikings&quot; which examined the possibility of Viking pre-Columbian contact with North America.
Sveinbjörn can be heard performing Ásatrú marriage rites for Genesis and Paula P-Orridge on Psychic TV&#x27;s LP &quot;Live in Reykjavik&quot; and on the double LP entitled &quot;Those who do not&quot;.

In 1982 Sveinbjörn released an album, &quot;Eddukvæði (Songs from The Poetic Edda),&quot; in which he recites in rímur style 75 stanzas from Hávamál, Völuspá and Sigrdrífumál. The album, on the Gramm label, included a booklet of the poems in Icelandic, with translations into English, Swedish, and German.

David Tibet released a CD of Sveinbjörn performing his own rímur and reciting the traditional Poetic Edda under the title &quot;Current 93 presents Sveinbjörn &#x27;Edda&quot;&#x27; in two editions through the World Serpent Distribution.

His biography &quot;Allsherjargoðinn&quot; was written by Berglind Gunnarsdóttir and published in 1992.

A memorial stone for Sveinbjörn was inaugurated in Reykjavík on 22 April 2010. It is located next to the site of the planned &quot;hof Ásatrúarfélagsins&quot; on the hill Öskjuhlíð.

His sister, Halldóra B. Björnsson, translated &quot;Beowulf&quot; into Icelandic as &quot;Bjólfskviða&quot;, &quot;The Lay of Bjólfur&quot; in 1968; a version was published in 1983.

<text>Opsound was a website which aggregated links to music released under Creative Commons licenses. Opsound aggregated links to music hosted on other servers, as well as provided discussion forums and organized real-world events and concerts. It published one CD by the artist Catalpa Catalpa entitled &quot;Hardoncity.&quot;

Opsound was a social art project by Sal Randolph, who created the site to provide a space for open, uncurated collaboration between musicians and sound artists. It was described on the site as &quot;a gift economy in action, an experiment in applying the model of free software to music.&quot;

Lawrence Lessig often mentioned Opsound when discussing Creative Commons, citing its structure and licensing as a positive aid to enhanced collaboration and communication between artists.

Opsound did not host works, leaving that to others, such as the Internet Archive&#x27;s Netlabels collection. Metadata included descriptions of songs and artists, track numbers, and indexed keywords associated with songs. All songs were available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (typically version 2.5, but sometimes only older versions of the license). Some songs were licensed under the more liberal Attribution license. Popularity charts were added around the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004. A redesign of the site was implemented towards the end of 2005. Some popular artists included _aa_, Binary Beats, and the Evolution Control Committee. There were plans to add software for so-called &quot;microlabels&quot; to allow people to create their own albums from the sound pool.

<text>Waheed Alli, Baron Alli (born 16 November 1964) is a British media entrepreneur and politician. He has held executive positions at several television production companies including the Endemol Shine Group, Carlton Television Productions (now ITV Studios), Planet 24, and Chorion. Alli served as the Chief Executive of Silvergate Media until 2022, Chairman of Koovs Plc and a director at Olga Productions. He is a member of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, sitting as a life peer for the Labour Party, and is described as one of only a few openly gay Muslim politicians in the world.

In August 2024, it was reported that Alli had been given unrestricted access to 10 Downing Street, uncommon for anyone not formally employed in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, and that he had held a reception for party donors in the Downing Street garden. He was also reported to have gifted Keir Starmer nearly £16,200 of free clothing, which initially was not properly declared, while Starmer’s wife, Victoria, was given £5,000 of free clothing, which at first was not declared. Starmer admitted Alli gave him £32,000 to pay for clothing, double what he had previously declared. As of October 2024, Lord Alli is under investigation for alleged non-registration of interests.

==Early life==
Alli’s mother, a nurse, is an Indo-Trinidadian from Trinidad and Tobago, and his estranged father, a mechanic, is an Indo-Guyanese from Guyana. His mother was Hindu and his father Muslim; he has two brothers, one Hindu and the other Muslim.

Alli attended Stanley Technical College in South Norwood and left school at 16 with nine O-levels.

Alli is one of a group of prominent Guyanese people in Britain, which includes Raj Persaud, Herman Ouseley, David Dabydeen, Cynthia Pine, Keith Waithe and Rudolph Dunbar.

==Business career==
Alli started work as a junior researcher for a finance magazine, crediting his first success to Salem Ghayar, who hired and mentored him. After a few years of preparing monthly reports for potential investors, he was headhunted by Save &amp; Prosper, part of Robert Fleming &amp; Co. Eventually he returned to his original employer, and worked his way up in the media business within Robert Maxwell&#x27;s stable of publications. 

He then went to the City for a second career in investment banking, through which he became wealthy. In the mid-1980s he met Charlie Parsons, who was to become his business partner as well as his life partner.

Alli&#x27;s third career, and the first in which he achieved public prominence, was in the television industry. He and Parsons set up 24 Hour Productions, which produced &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;the most talked about television programme in Britain&quot;. In 1992 they merged with Bob Geldof&#x27;s Planet Pictures to form Planet 24. Such was its success that it became one of the largest TV production companies in the country, and the main independent supplier to Channel 4. It was responsible for genre-breaking programmes such as &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;. Carlton Television bought Planet 24 in March 1999 for £15 million, with Alli and Parsons retaining the rights to the lucrative &quot;Survivor&quot; format. Waheed Alli became a Carlton board director before stepping down a year later.

In April 2003, Alli took over as chairman of the media rights company Chorion Ltd, which owns rights to Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie, and has offices beyond the UK in New York, Sydney, and Tokyo. He was chairman of AIM-listed ASOS.com and a director of Olga Television, entertainer Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s production company. He also backed Shine Limited, Elisabeth Murdoch&#x27;s media production company, which she later sold to 21st Century Fox (owned by her father Rupert Murdoch) for £211 million. In August 2011, he stepped down from the chairmanship of Chorion, selling half his stake in ASOS.com the next month for £14.25 million. The sale helped to finance Alli&#x27;s new company, Silvergate Media, and its purchase of the rights to Beatrix Potter and &quot;Octonauts&quot; from Chorion.

He was part of a failed £100m bid backed by private equity firm 3i to buy Virgin Radio from SMG plc in 2005. In March 2007, he was appointed as SMG&#x27;s non-executive director.

Alli was a founder investor in Koovs, an Indian online retailer looking to replicate the success of ASOS in the subcontinent. The company was set up in 2012, intending to raise £22m with a stock market listing on London&#x27;s AIM. In December 2019, the company went into administration after funding could not be found. The administration of Koovs was extended due to shareholders&#x27; concerns. FRP Advisory state this in their most recent update to the market.

==Politics==

Alli joined the Labour Party at the persuasion of his neighbour Emily Thornberry, to whom he remains close. He is also close to Anji Hunter, Director of Government Relations in Tony Blair&#x27;s first government. Prime Minister Blair used him for years as a means to help him reach out to a younger generation (aka &quot;youth subculture&quot;). He was made a life peer as Baron Alli, of Norbury in the London Borough of Croydon, on 18 July 1998 at the age of 34, becoming the youngest and the first openly gay peer in Parliament. He sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. The BBC summarised his appointment as &quot;the antithesis of the stereotypical &#x27;establishment&#x27; peer – young, Asian and from the world of media and entertainment&quot;.

He maintains ties with his Caribbean roots, both with other British-Guyanese politicians such as Valerie Amos and Trevor Phillips, and with President Bharrat Jagdeo.

Alli has used his political position to argue for gay rights. He spearheaded the campaign to repeal Section 28. He advocated lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, equal to heterosexuals; this eventually became law as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. It was during a heated exchange with conservative opponents, led by Baroness Young, that he informed his fellow peers that he was gay. In April 1999, he said in a speech, &quot;I have never been confused about my sexuality. I have been confused about the way I am treated as a result of it. The only confusion lies in the prejudice shown, some of it tonight [i.e. in the House], and much of it enshrined in the law.&quot;

In 2006, he participated in the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights adopting the Declaration of Montreal and in 2009, he spearheaded an effort to repeal clauses in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which prohibited religious institutions from conducting the ceremonies on their premises. This campaign culminated in a bipartisan amendment, which became part of the Equality Act 2010. He influenced the draft Communications Bill in 2003.

Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Alli has led the Labour Party&#x27;s fundraising efforts. In 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Alli had donated £500,000 to the party since 2020, as well as giving Starmer personal donations worth over £50,000.

==Controversies==
In August 2024, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Alli had been given unrestricted access to 10 Downing Street, uncommon for anyone not formally employed in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, and that he had held a reception for party donors in the Downing Street garden. Pat McFadden later told Sky News that he did not think that Alli still held a Downing Street pass. He was also reported to have gifted Starmer nearly £16,200 of free clothing, which initially was not properly declared, while Starmer’s wife, Victoria, was given £5,000 of free clothing, which at first was not declared. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; referred to Alli&#x27;s loan of a &quot;swanky&quot; apartment to the Starmers, with a value of £20,000, as &quot;donor-gate.&quot; Labour MPs repeatedly used the apartment. On 13 December 2021, Starmer recorded there a Christmas message urging the public to work from home, while giving the impression he was in his own home, with a family photo behind him. 

The &quot;Telegraph&quot; also reported that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner faced an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner over the use of Alli&#x27;s $2.5-million New York apartment. On 27 September, Starmer admitted Alli gave him £32,000 to pay for clothing, double what he had previously declared.

As of October 2024, Lord Alli is under investigation by the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards for &quot;alleged non-registration of interests leading to potential breaches of paragraphs 14(a) and 17 of the thirteenth edition of the Code of Conduct for Members of the House of Lords&quot;.

==Philanthropy and recognition==
===Philanthropy===
Alli&#x27;s work has focused on gay rights, youth and education. 

He is the President of the Croydon Youth Development Trust. He is a patron of Skillset, the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training within the creative media industries. 

In 2002 he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, stating: &quot;Being a teenager isn&#x27;t easy and it&#x27;s particularly difficult for vulnerable and socially excluded members of our community. The Albert Kennedy Trust offers young gay men, lesbians and bisexuals a unique and targeted service. My first task as Patron will be to support plans to extend these services across the UK, to help the increasing number of young people contacting the Trust.&quot; Alli is a patron of Oxford Pride, the annual Pride event in Oxfordshire, of Pride London and of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

===Recognition===
Alli is a former Chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester. In 2005 he was named one of the 20 most important Asians in British media and in 2008 he won a Stonewall Award for the category of political figure. 

A portrait of Alli is in the National Portrait Gallery collection, which contains &quot;portraits of the Nation&#x27;s great men and women&quot;.

<text>Helena Ann Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws (born 12 May 1950), is a Scottish barrister, broadcaster, and Labour member of the House of Lords. She was Principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, from 2011 to 2018. A Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn, an Honorary Writer to the Signet and the recipient of 42 Honorary Degrees from many universities including those of Glasgow and Edinburgh in recognition of work on women and the law and on widening participation in higher education.

==Early life and education==
Kennedy was born on 12 May 1950 in Glasgow, Scotland, one of the four daughters of Mary Veronica (née Jones) and Joshua Patrick Kennedy, nicknamed &quot;Mae&quot; and &quot;Joss&quot;, respectively. Her parents were committed Labour activists and devoutly Roman Catholic. Her father, a printer with the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, was a trade union official.

She attended Holyrood Secondary School in Glasgow, where she was appointed Head Girl. She studied law at the Council of Legal Education in London.

==Legal career==
In 1972, Kennedy was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn. Among her many cases, Kennedy acted as junior counsel for child murderer Myra Hindley during her 1974 trial for plotting to escape from Holloway Prison. She was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1991.

==Politics==
Kennedy rebels against her party whip in the House of Lords more frequently than any other Labour Peer, having a dissent rate of 33.3%. She was Chair of Charter 88 (1992–1997) and is closely affiliated to the educational charity Common Purpose. In 2020, she worked with the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith and democracy activist Luke de Pulford to create the global pressure group Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. In March 2021, China placed sanctions on her. The sanctions were condemned by the Prime Minister and led the Foreign Secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador.

==Academia==
Kennedy became the first Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, serving from 1994 until 2001. She was elected principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, in July 2010 and served in the role from September 2011. She retired in 2018 and became Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University on 26 July 2018.

==Personal life==
From 1978 to 1984 she lived with the actor Iain Mitchell, and together they had a son. In 1986, Kennedy married Iain Louis Hutchison, a surgeon, with whom she has a daughter and a son.

<text>Tex G. Hall (&quot;Ihbudah Hishi&quot; &quot;Red Tipped Arrow&quot;), (born 18 September 1956) is a Native American who was tribal chairman of Three Affiliated Tribes from 1998 to 2006. He lost the 2006 election to Marcus Levings, but in the 2010 tribal election, Hall defeated Levings. He ran for the position of President of the National Congress of American Indians in 2001 and won his campaign at the annual convention in Spokane, Washington over Chairman Brian Wallance of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada. Tex was reelected in 2003 at the annual convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico over Ernie Stensgar, Chairman of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe of Idaho.

Tex Hall grew up on his family&#x27;s ranch in Mandaree, North Dakota where he still ranches cattle. He has served as Chairman of the Inter Tribal Economic Alliance.

Hall earned his master&#x27;s degree in Education from the University of Mary in North Dakota. In 1995 Hall was named North Dakota Indian Educator of the Year. Hall has been inducted into the North Dakota Amateur Basketball Hall of Fame, the National Indian Athletic Association Hall of Fame, and the Minot State University Bottineau Athletic Hall of Fame. He is also a many-time all tournament team member of the SIT tournament and is the current record holder for most jab-steps in an SIT game (31).

The Fort Berthold Reservation was well positioned when the application of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling technologies caused a boom in oil production from the Bakken shale formation beginning around the year 2000. As chairmen at the time, Hall became active in the oil boom on his reservation. As of 2010, he was &quot;President of the Fort Berthold Allottee Land &amp; Mineral Owners&#x27; Association, owner of Maheshu Energy, LLC, Red Tipped Arrow, LLC, Red Arrow Homes &amp; Development, LLC and Tex Hall Ranch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.minotdailynews.com/page/content.detail/id/541495.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 he testified in Congress in opposition to proposed regulations about fracking.

As Tribal Chairman, he has travelled frequently to Denver, CO, to meet with EPA officials for approval of a refinery for oil extracted from the Bakken formation. Plans for refinery construction on the Fort Berthold Reservation received Department of the Interior approval in October 2012. Hall has had an ongoing interest in energy issues. A 2004 interview with Hall on the US Department of Energy &quot;Wind Powering America&quot; page gives extensive description of the wind power resources on tribal lands.

<doc id="470796" wikidata="Q5593803" url="?curid=470796" title="Grammy Award for Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for solo, duo/groups or collaborative (vocal or instrumental) gospel or Contemporary Christian music (CCM) and its subgenres&#x27; recordings and is limited to singles or tracks only.

This award was first handed out in 1968 under the name of Best Gospel Performance and was intended for albums only. 

In 1971 the award was renamed to Best Gospel Performance (other than soul gospel), including both singles and albums, and ran until 1978 when the award was divided into two new awards, the Grammy Awards for Best Gospel Performance, Traditional and Best Gospel Performance, Contemporary. 

The category was then revived in 2005 and it was known once again under the name of Best Gospel Performance. In 2012, following a major overhaul of the Grammy categories, this award was renamed as Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance which was eligible for all subgenres in the gospel/Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) field. 

From 2015, due to a restructuring of the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music category field, this category will merge with the Best Contemporary Christian Music Song to create the new [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]] category, which will recognize both performers and songwriters of Contemporary Christian Music songs (Gospel performances will now fall under the Best Gospel Performance/Song category). According to the Grammy committee, &quot;changes to the field were made in the interest of clarifying the criteria, representing the current culture and creative DNA of the gospel and Contemporary Christian Music communities, and better reflecting the diversity and authenticity of today&#x27;s gospel music industry&quot;. 

The Blackwood Brothers hold the record for most awards in this category with four wins, two of them alongside Porter Wagoner. They also hold the record for most nominations, with seven. Two-time winners include Porter Wagoner, The Oak Ridge Boys, Karen Clark Sheard and CeCe Winans.

<doc id="470797" wikidata="Q1218731" url="?curid=470797" title="The Bald Soprano">
<text>La Cantatrice chauve – translated from French as The Bald Soprano or The Bald Prima Donna – is the first play written by Romanian-French playwright Eugène Ionesco.

Nicolas Bataille directed the premiere on 11 May 1950 at the Théâtre des Noctambules, Paris. Since 1957, it has been in permanent showing at the Théâtre de la Huchette, which received a &quot;Molière d&#x27;honneur&quot; for its performances. It holds the world record for the play that has been staged continuously in the same theatre for the longest time. Although it went unnoticed at first, the play was eventually championed by a few established writers and critics and, in the end, won critical acclaim. By the 1960s, &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; had already been recognized as a modern classic and an important seminal work in the Theatre of the Absurd. With a record number of interpretations, it has become one of the most performed plays in France.

==Origin==
The idea for the play came to Ionesco while he was trying to learn English with the Assimil method. Impressed by the contents of the dialogues, often very sober and strange, he decided to write an absurd play named &quot;L&#x27;anglais sans peine&quot; (&quot;English without toil&quot;). Other possible titles which were considered included &quot;Il pleut des chiens et des chats,&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s raining cats and dogs&quot;, translated in French literally); &quot;L&#x27;heure anglaise&quot; and &quot;Big Ben Follies&quot;.

Its actual title was the result of an error in rehearsal by actor Henri-Jacques Huet: the fire chief&#x27;s monologue initially included a mention of &quot;l&#x27;institutrice blonde&quot; (&quot;the blonde schoolteacher&quot;), but Huet said &quot;la cantatrice chauve&quot;, and Ionesco, who was present, decided to re-use the phrase.

== Overview ==
The Smiths are a traditional couple from London who have invited another couple, the Martins, over for a visit. They are joined later by the Smiths&#x27; maid, Mary, and the local fire chief, who is also Mary&#x27;s lover. The two families engage in meaningless banter, telling stories and relating nonsensical poems. At one point, Mrs. Martin converses with her husband as if he were a stranger she just met. As the fire chief turns to leave, he mentions &quot;the bald soprano&quot; in passing, which has a very unsettling effect on the others. Mrs. Smith replies that &quot;she always styles her hair the same way.&quot; After the Fire Chief&#x27;s exit, the play devolves into a series of complete non-sequiturs with no resemblance to normal conversation. It ends with the two couples shouting in unison &quot;It&#x27;s not that way. It&#x27;s over here!&quot; (&quot;C’est pas par là, c’est par ici!&quot; ) right before a blackout occurs. When the lights come back on, the scene starts from the beginning with the Martins reciting the Smiths&#x27; lines from the beginning of the play for a while before the curtain closes.

==Story==
*Scene 1

The play opens on Mrs. Smith reciting the events of the night with Mr. Smith. They discuss the death of someone they knew, Bobby Watson. The play then shifts back to reality and they realize that Bobby has been dead for four years. Suddenly they flash back to when he was alive and engaged to a woman who was also called Bobby Watson. Then they shift back to reality where they realize that he has left behind two children and they are gossiping about whom his wife will remarry. Allegedly she is going to name another relative by the same name, but being that they all have the same name and work in the same industry the Smiths have a difficult time figuring out who is who.

*Scene 2

Their maid, Mary enters, announcing that the Martins have arrived. The Smiths leave.

*Scene 3

The Martins enter, and Mary chides them for being late; then she exits.

*Scene 4
After entering the room, the Martins realize that they have met each other before. They are surprised to find that they are both from the city of Manchester, that they both took the same train to London, that they both traveled second class, that they both reside at No. 19 Bromfield Street, that they sleep in the same bed, and that they both have a two-year-old daughter named Alice with one red eye and one white eye. They come to the conclusion that they are husband and wife. They recognize each other and embrace.

*Scene 5
Mary is on stage with the Martins, who are asleep. She tells the audience that the two are mistaken, that they are not husband and wife, but that, never mind, things should be left just as they are.

*Scene 6

The Martins, alone, agree that now that they&#x27;ve found each other, they should just live as they had before.

*Scene 7

When the Smiths return they talk about and with their guests. The doorbell rings and Mr. Smith goes to open the door.

*Scene 8
The Fire Chief enters. He&#x27;s disappointed to find no fire at the Smiths&#x27;, but they promise that they&#x27;ll call him if one occurs. While they wait for something to happen they tell telling stories, none of which make sense.

*Scene 9
Mary enters and tells her own story, in which she reveals that she is the lover of the Fire Chief. The Smiths then push her out of the room.

*Scene 10
The Fire Chief leaves. Before departure, he mentions the bald soprano.

*Scene 11
The Martins and the Smiths recite nonsensical truisms. Then all sense of language dissipates as the two couples quarrel, but no one is able to communicate and none of their issues are resolved. As they argue the lights fade; when they rise again, the Martins are in the Smiths&#x27; living room, repeating the same lines with which the Smiths opened the play.

==Meaning==
Like many plays in the theatre of the absurd genre, the underlying theme of &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; is not immediately apparent. Many suggest that it expresses the futility of meaningful communication in modern society. The script is charged with non sequiturs that give the impression that the characters are not even listening to each other in their frantic efforts to make their own voices heard. There was speculation that it was parody around the time of its first performance, but Ionesco states in an essay written to his critics that he had no intention of parody, but if he were parodying anything, it would be everything.

&quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; appears to have been written as a continuous loop. The final scene contains stage instructions to start the performance over from the very beginning, with the Martin couple substituted for the Smith couple and vice versa. However, this decision was only added in after the show&#x27;s hundredth performance, and it was originally the Smiths who restarted the show, in exactly the same manner as before.

According to Ionesco, he had several possible endings in mind, including a climax in which the &quot;author&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; antagonizes the audience, and even a version in which the audience is shot with machine guns. However, he ultimately settled for a cheaper solution, the cycle. Ionesco told in an interview, &quot;I wanted to give a meaning to the play by having it begin all over again with two characters. In this way the end becomes a new beginning but, since there are two couples in the play, it begins the first time with the Smiths and the second time with the Martins, to suggest the interchangeable nature of the characters: the Smiths are the Martins and the Martins are the Smiths&quot;.

<doc id="470800" wikidata="Q594381" url="?curid=470800" title="Brough of Birsay">
<text>The Brough of Birsay is an uninhabited tidal island off the north-west coast of The Mainland of Orkney, Scotland, in the parish of Birsay. It is located around 13 miles north of Stromness and features the remains of Pictish and Norse settlements as well as a modern lighthouse.

==Geography and geology==
The island is accessible on foot at low tide via a largely natural causeway. It is separated from the mainland by a stretch of water at high tide: the Sound of Birsay.

The Norse settlement has been partly removed by coastal erosion, and the cliffs are reinforced by concrete rip-rap to prevent further damage.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name for the island was &quot;Byrgisey&quot; which means fort island, and gives the parish its name. Brough, indeed, means fort (for etymology, see broch).

== History ==
===Earliest settlement of Christians and Picts===
The earliest settlement on the island is thought to have been in the 6th century, perhaps by Christian missionaries. In the 7th and 8th centuries it was a significant Pictish fortress, but by the 9th century the Picts had been displaced by Norsemen.

Excavations were first undertaken by Cecil Curle in 1936–1937.

The Pictish settlement is attested by a small well and an important collection of artefacts (now in The Orkney Museum (formerly known as Tankerness House Museum), Kirkwall and in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh). Notable among these are a group of moulds for fine metalworking, showing that bronze brooches and other ornaments were being manufactured on the site in the 8th century. The enclosure round the Norse church overlies a Pictish graveyard, and an important Pictish carved stone was found in pieces in this enclosure during site clearance (also on display in Edinburgh: replica on site). The most interesting Pictish artefact found is a stone slab showing three figures and some additional Pictish symbols. It is not known what the subject of this carving is, but it likely shows aristocratic Picts as they wished to be perceived. This early 8th-century slab shows a striking procession of three Picts dressed in long robes and bearing spears, swords and square shields. Above the figures are parts of four Pictish symbols. Two simple cross-incised slabs, likely grave-markers, were also found in the graveyard, and are probably Pictish or early medieval in date (displayed on site).


===Norse settlement and St Peter&#x27;s chapel===
The extensive remains of an excavated Norse settlement and church overlay the earlier Pictish settlement. Before Kirkwall became the centre of power in the 12th century, Birsay was the seat of the rulers of Orkney.

According to the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; the main residence of the Earl of Orkney, Thorfinn the Mighty (1014–1065), was located in Birsay. At this time the first Bishop of Orkney was appointed and his cathedral, known as &quot;Christchurch,&quot; which later housed the remains of St Magnus, probably on the site of the present day St Magnus Kirk, nearby on the Mainland. It was once thought that Earl/Jarl Thorfinn&#x27;s hall could have been located on the brough but it is today thought to have been nearby on the Mainland.

Today, many of the remains of the settlement are visible. The most significant being the remains of a fine, though small Romanesque church. This dates back to the 12th century and was dedicated to St Peter. The church has a semi-circular apse and there are the remains of stone benches for the congregation lining the walls. The red sandstone altar was reconstructed in the 1930s. An enclosure wall surrounding the kirk separated the graveyard from the houses beyond.

The church has an interesting shape; probably with a square tower at one end, and a semi-circular apse at the other. There is some evidence of an earlier, possibly Pictish church on the same site. The church was a place of pilgrimage until the Middle Ages. The remains of adjoining buildings round three sides of an open court suggest that it may once have been a small monastery (though there is no documentation for such a foundation). 

There were also a number of Norse dwellings, some of them of considerable size indicating substantial wealth. They included longhouses, featuring both heating and drainage systems and some indications that saunas were present. Although not all the houses were likely in use at the same time, there was a significant community living here. The site, and particularly the objects found there, have been central to debates about the nature of Pictish-Norse relations in Northern Scotland.

The site is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.

== Lighthouse ==
The unmanned Brough of Birsay Lighthouse is on the Brough.

==Flora and fauna==
Sea bird breeding colonies can be found on the brough.

Young was educated at Perth Academy, from where she went to the University of Edinburgh to read Classics and Business Studies.

As Vice-chair of the Council for the Institute of Health Management, Young carried out much of the work on the development of a “Policy Plan for the Institute – Priorities and Objectives”. She was appointed president in 1987, the first woman to hold the position.

In 1997 Young was appointed as Vice Chair of the BBC, standing down in November 2000 after two and a half years.

Young is currently chair of the Woodland Trust. She joined the Trust&#x27;s Board in January 2016 and became chair on 9 June 2016.

She has been a member of the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee since January 2024.

She was the Chief Executive of health charity Diabetes UK, a position she took up on 1 November 2010 until September 2015.

Before joining Diabetes UK, Young was involved in the establishment of the Care Quality Commission (CQC)s . Then Health Secretary Alan Johnson announced the appointment of Baroness Young as chair of the organisation on 15 April 2008. She stood down in 2010. The announcement followed an independent recruitment exercise conducted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission and a pre-appointment scrutiny hearing. by the Health Select Committee, which subsequently endorsed Young for appointment as the CQC chair. She held this position until 1 February 2010. On 21 October 2010, Young became the Chief Executive of the health charity, Diabetes UK. Baroness Young resigned from Diabetes UK in 2015 and took up the Presidency of the Royal Veterinary College in 2019.

Prior to taking up the post of chair of the CQC, Young was the chief executive of the Environment Agency (2000 – May 2008), an appointment which led to her becoming a non-affiliated member in the House of Lords; previously she had taken the Labour whip.

<doc id="470804" wikidata="Q1254688" url="?curid=470804" title="Lewes District">
<text>Lewes is a local government district in East Sussex, England. The district is named after the town of Lewes. The largest town is Seaford. The district also includes the towns of Newhaven, Peacehaven and Telscombe and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The council meets in Lewes and has its main offices in Newhaven.

The district lies on the south coast, and a large part of it lies within the South Downs National Park. The district covers an area of , with of coastline. Plumpton Racecourse is within the district. There are 28 parishes in the district.

The neighbouring districts are Brighton and Hove, Mid Sussex and Wealden.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chailey Rural District
*Lewes Municipal Borough
*Newhaven Urban District
*Seaford Urban District
The new district was named after Lewes, the ancient county town of Sussex.

Since 2016 the council has shared a chief executive and other staff with nearby Eastbourne Borough Council.

==Governance==
Lewes District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by East Sussex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2018. Since the 2023 election an alliance of the Greens and Labour has formed the council&#x27;s administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and changes of allegiance up to June 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 41 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The wards, with their populations at the 2021 Census, are:
The district straddles the constituencies of Lewes and Brighton Kemptown.

===Premises===

Since 2013, full council meetings have been held at County Hall in Lewes, the headquarters of East Sussex County Council. In 2023 the council moved its main offices to Marine Workshops, a former industrial building in Newhaven which it shares with East Sussex Colleges Group.

When created in 1974 the council inherited four sets of offices from its predecessor councils:
*Lewes House, 32 High Street, Lewes from Chailey Rural District Council.
*Lewes Town Hall and the adjoining municipal offices at 4 Fisher Street from Lewes Town Council.
*20 Fort Road, Newhaven from Newhaven Urban District Council.
*The Downs, Sutton Road, Seaford from Seaford Urban District Council.
The Downs was converted into housing and a leisure centre built behind it. The new council&#x27;s offices were divided between the other three buildings. In 1998 the council acquired Southover House on Southover Road in Lewes, which had previously been offices of East Sussex County Council, to serve as its main offices, remaining there until 2022.

==Geography==
The Prime Meridian passes through the district.

Sussex Police has its head office in the town of Lewes.

===Towns and parishes===
The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Lewes, Newhaven, Peacehaven, Seaford and Telscombe take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

‡ St John Without, St Ann Without, Tarring Neville and Southease are separate civil parishes with parish meetings, but due to their small size population statistics are not published separately for them.

<doc id="470809" wikidata="Q1072104" url="?curid=470809" title="Chichester District">
<text>Chichester is a local government district in West Sussex, England. It is named after the city of Chichester, which is its largest settlement and where the council is based. The district includes the towns of Midhurst, Petworth and Selsey and surrounding rural areas, including many villages. The district includes part of the South Downs National Park, and Chichester Harbour is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. At the 2021 census the district had a population of 124,531.

The district is on the coast, facing the English Channel. The neighbouring districts are Arun, Horsham, Waverley, East Hampshire and Havant.

==History==
Chichester itself had been an ancient borough, which additionally held city status from 1075 when the Diocese of Chichester moved its seat from Selsey to Chichester.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of seven districts within West Sussex. The new district covered the whole area of three former districts and parts of a fourth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chichester Municipal Borough (city)
*Chichester Rural District (except 13 parishes which went to Arun)
*Midhurst Rural District
*Petworth Rural District
The new district was named Chichester, after its largest settlement. The medieval territory of the Rape of Chichester had also covered much of the area of the new district. A successor parish was established covering the former borough of Chichester, and Chichester&#x27;s city status passed to the new parish rather than the wider district. As such, Chichester City Council is a parish council, whilst Chichester District Council has greater powers and covers the much larger area of Chichester District.

==Governance==
Chichester District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by West Sussex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The Local Alliance and Greens sit together as a group, which forms the council&#x27;s largest opposition group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

====Councillors and wards====
List of Chichester district councillors by ward:

===Premises===
The council is based at East Pallant House, on East Pallant in the centre of Chichester. The oldest part of the building was originally a large house, which had subsequently served as the headquarters of the old Chichester Rural District Council prior to the 1974 reorganisation. Large modern extensions have since been added to the building.

==Geography==
Chichester District occupies the western part of West Sussex, bordering on Hampshire to the west and Surrey to the north. The districts of Arun and Horsham abut to the east; the English Channel to the south. The district is divided by the South Downs escarpment, with the northern part being in the Weald, composed of a mixture of sandstone ridges and low-lying clays known as the Western Weald. To the south the dip slope of the downs falls gently to a flat coastal plain and the sea. The Western Weald is drained by the River Arun and its tributaries including the rivers Lox, Kird and especially the River Rother and its tributaries the River Lod and the Haslingbourne Stream. On the northern boundary Blackdown is the highest point in Sussex, while further east around Loxwood the land is low and quite flat. The south of the district has many permeable chalk and gravel areas and is drained by two winterbournes, the River Lavant and River Ems, which are usually dry in the summer. The large inlet known as Chichester Harbour and the headland of Selsey Bill are conspicuous features of the coast.

The district, apart from the few main roads, is generally rural in character, as can be seen by the number of villages within it. Apart from the coastal strip there are few main roads, and the erstwhile railways which once served Midhurst have long been closed.

==Civil parishes==

There are 67 civil parishes in Chichester District. The parish of Chichester holds city status, allowing the parish council to call itself a city council. The parish councils for Midhurst, Petworth and Selsey have each declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Landmarks==
Apart from the geographical landmarks Chichester District contains architectural and cultural places including Chichester Cathedral, Chichester Festival Theatre, The Novium and Pallant House Gallery in the city. Stately homes open to the public include Petworth House and Uppark, both National Trust properties, Goodwood House and Stansted Park. West Dean College is open at certain times of the year. There is horse racing at Goodwood Racecourse, the Goodwood Festival of Speed at Goodwood House, and the Goodwood Revival at Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit. Cowdray House is a ruined Tudor mansion near Midhurst. Fishbourne Roman Palace lies west of Chichester city centre. To the north of the city are Weald and Downland Open Air Museum and Halnaker Windmill. There are gardens open to the public at Woolbeding and Pound Commons and West Dean College.

==Economy==
West Sussex County Council and Chichester District Council are major employers in Chichester, along with Rolls-Royce Motor Cars assembly plant at nearby Westhampnett. Boatbuilding is an important industry along the coast. Many people from the northern parts of the district commute to work in London, using the A3 road or the railways from Portsmouth to London Waterloo station and Littlehampton to London Victoria station. Fertile soils on the coastal plain are used for arable farming and intensive vegetable production, the latter employing many migrant workers from Eastern Europe. High sunlight levels and a mild climate also make the coastal region suitable for glasshouse growing. A fertile strip of land on the north side of the River Rother is also used for vegetable growing, but most of the area north of the Downs is of low agricultural value and there are large areas of forest and pasture, interspersed with arable cropping.

<text>The flag of Manitoba consists of a Red Ensign defaced with the shield of the provincial coat of arms. Adopted in 1965 shortly after the new national flag was inaugurated, it has been the flag of the province since May 12 of the following year. Its adoption was intended to maintain the legacy of the Canadian Red Ensign as the country&#x27;s unofficial flag, after the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965. Manitoba&#x27;s flag has been frequently mistaken for the flag of the neighbouring province of Ontario, which is also a Red Ensign with its respective coat of arms. This, along with criticisms of a lack of inclusivity of the flag, has led some Manitobans to call for a new and more distinct flag.

==History==
The &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; received royal assent on May 12, 1870, allowing for the creation of the province of Manitoba; it officially joined Confederation two months later on July 15. On August 2 of that same year, an Order in Council was promulgated to establish a seal for the new province. It featured the Cross of Saint George at the chief and a bison on a green field for the lower portion. Subsequently, King Edward VII issued a Royal Warrant on May 10, 1905, allowing Manitoba to utilize their own coat of arms. At the time, this consisted solely of a shield identical to the Great Seal of the province.

On February 15, 1965, the federal government introduced a new national flag featuring a maple leaf to replace the Union Jack (the official flag) and the Canadian Red Ensign, the country&#x27;s civil ensign at the time that had been used unofficially as the national flag. The Great Canadian Flag Debate that preceded this change showed there were still parts of Canada where imperialist nostalgia was strong. Lamenting the demise of the Canadian Red Ensign, its proponents in those regions endeavoured to have it modified as a provincial flag. Resistance to the new national flag was most vociferous in the rural areas of Manitoba and Ontario. Consequently, both provinces chose to incorporate the Red Ensign into their official flags. In Manitoba, Maitland Steinkopf – the Provincial Secretary at the time – favoured a contest to design a provincial flag from scratch. In order to meet halfway with those who wanted to utilize the Canadian Red Ensign as Manitoba&#x27;s flag without modification, the Red Ensign was selected but the provincial shield was employed instead of the national one. The Act of Legislature that tabled this flag received royal assent on May 11, 1965. The provincial government subsequently sought approval from Queen Elizabeth II, since this entailed defacing a British flag; this was granted on August 27 of that same year. The new flag was first hoisted officially on May 12, 1966. One of the two flag-raisers at that ceremony was a descendant of Thomas Button, the British explorer who in 1612 raised the first British flag over what is now Manitoba.

In an online survey conducted in 2001 by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), Manitoba&#x27;s flag ranked in the bottom half of state, provincial and territorial flags from Canada, the United States, and select current and former territories of the United States. It finished in 44th place out of 72 – one spot behind Ontario&#x27;s flag – and finished last among Canadian flags. The Association was of the opinion that the flag lacked distinctiveness. It recommended making the bison as a central figure, as well as doing away with the Union Jack in the canton.

===Modern day===
Due to the similarities shared by the Manitoba flag with the flag of neighbouring Ontario – with the bottom part of their escutcheons being the sole difference – the two pennants have often been mistaken for one another. Others have complained that it is an anachronistic remnant of British colonial rule over Manitoba. These issues have brought about calls by some Manitobans for a new flag unique to their home province that would represent it better.
In 2001, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; held a contest to design a potential new flag for Manitoba, with the top 34 designs selected for voting. The winning entry came from Heather Jones of Fort Rouge, whose design consisted of a stylized blue bison set against a golden sun. However, the flag was never adopted by the province.

A motion calling for a change to the flag was put forward on the program at the provincial New Democratic Party&#x27;s annual convention in March 2009. However, it failed to make the deadline to get voted on and consequently did not proceed further. Coupled with the fact that the Progressive Conservative Party – which in 2016 won the largest majority in the province&#x27;s history and were re-elected in 2019 – are in favour of the status quo given its connection to Manitoba&#x27;s origins, the prospect of changing the flag in the near future appears to be remote. The 150th anniversary of Manitoba&#x27;s entrance into Confederation in 2020 led to renewed calls for a redesign of the flag. In 2024, the Manitoba chapter of the NAVA released a public survey asking for the opinion of Manitobans on the current flag and if they would support the pursuit of a new provincial flag, signalling the start of an effort by the association to change the flag.

==Design==
===Description===
The flag of Manitoba is described in detail in &quot;The Provincial Flag Act&quot;, provincial legislation that has been in force from February 1, 1988. It specifies the flag is to have an aspect ratio of 2:1, &quot;with the Union Jack occupying the upper quarter next the staff and with the shield of the armorial ensigns of the province centred in the half farthest from the staff.&quot; The flag&#x27;s blazon – as outlined in the letters patent registering it with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on November 15, 2010 – reads, &quot;Gules an escutcheon of the Arms of Manitoba, a canton of the Royal Union Flag proper&quot;.

The official colour scheme follows the British Admiralty Colour Code, with  T1144 utilized for nylon worsted bunting, and No. T818A for any other bunting. This roughly corresponds to the Pantone Matching System as indicated below.

===Symbolism===

The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. According to Auguste Vachon, the bison evokes the Indigenous peoples living in the province, such as the Assiniboine and the Cree. Bison was an integral part of their livelihood, serving as a source of food and clothing. The Cross of Saint George alludes to the patron saint of England, as well as to the arms of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), which ruled over the land that is now Manitoba. The Red Ensign is a conspicuous symbol of Great Britain, Canada&#x27;s mother country.

===Similarities===
In addition to the aforementioned resemblance with the flag of Ontario and the Canadian Red Ensign, the Manitoban flag bears a likeness to the flag of the HBC. The company was the only private firm ever permitted to use the modified Red Ensign in its day-to-day operations, and its flag was frequently confused with that of several Canadian provinces. Manitoba&#x27;s flag is also analogous to the flag of Bermuda.

==Protocol==

Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the province&#x27;s Protocol Office. When flown together with the flag of Canada and the other provincial and territorial flags, the flag of Manitoba is sixth in the order of precedence (after the national flag and, in descending order of precedence, the flags of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick). This is because it was the fifth province to enter into Confederation, and the first one to join after the establishment of the Dominion on July 1, 1867.

In addition to the dates set out by the federal government for flying flags at half-mast, the provincial flag is half-masted upon the death of the Lieutenant Governor or premier (either an incumbent or a previous one) and may also be flown in such a manner when an individual honoured by Manitoba dies. Moreover, the flags situated at the province&#x27;s Legislative Building are lowered to half-mast upon the death of a soldier who was born or raised in Manitoba, or who was last stationed in the province before being deployed abroad.

<doc id="470814" wikidata="Q852550" url="?curid=470814" title="Gonaïves">
<text>Gonaïves (; also Les Gonaïves; , ) is a commune in northern Haiti, and the capital of the Artibonite department of Haiti. The population was 356,324 at the 2015 census.

==History==
The city of Gonaïves was founded around 1422 by a group of Taíno, who named it &quot;Gonaibo&quot; (to designate a locality of cacicat of the Jaragua). The Gulf of Gonâve is named after the town. 

In 1802, an important battle of the Haitian Revolution, the Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres was fought near Gonaïves.

Gonaïves is also known as Haiti&#x27;s city of independence, because it was the location of Jean-Jacques Dessalines declaring Haiti independent from France on January 1, 1804, by reading the Act of Independence, drafted by Boisrond Tonnerre, on the Place d&#x27;Armes of the town.
Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité, the wife of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, died here in August 1858.

In the early 2000s, Gonaïves was the scene of substantial rioting and violence motivated primarily by opposition to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and on February 5, 2004, a group calling itself the Revolutionary Artibonite Resistance Front seized control of the city, starting the 2004 Haïtian rebellion. But in recent years, the city has seen a complete return to order.

Even compared with other Haitian port cities, Gonaïves has long been vulnerable to hurricanes due to its location in a flood plain and due to the surrounding unforested mountains. In September 2004, Hurricane Jeanne caused major flooding and mudslides in the city. Four years later, the city was again devastated by another storm, Hurricane Hanna, which killed 529 people, mostly in flooded sections of Gonaïves, where the destruction was described as &quot;catastrophic&quot; and 495 bodies were discovered as late as September 5. Haitian authorities said the tally would grow once officials were able to make their way through the city. &quot;The assessment was only partial, because it was impossible to enter the city at that moment&quot;. Gonaïves Mayor Stephen Moise said at least 48,000 people from the Gonaïves area were forced into shelters.

In 2020, President Jovenel Moïse skipped a traditional visit to Gonaïves during a climate of violence. According to local media, an armed group targeted Prime Minister Ariel Henry&#x27;s visit on 1 January 2022, resulting in one death and two injuries.

==Education==
===University===
Gonaives has a variety of training centers including the Université Publique de l&#x27;Artibonite aux Gonaïves (UPAG); and 
The Law and Economics School of Gonaives.

==Health==
Gonaives is home to the recently renovated La Providence Hospital.

==Sport==

Gonaives has some major league teams including Eclair AC and Racing FC (Gonaives).

<doc id="470815" wikidata="Q1629013" url="?curid=470815" title="Horsham District">
<text>Horsham is a local government district in West Sussex, England. It is named after the town of Horsham, which is its largest settlement and where the council is based. The district also includes the surrounding rural area and contains many villages, the largest of which are Southwater and Billingshurst. The district includes part of the South Downs National Park and part of the designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty of High Weald. At the 2021 census the district had a population of 147,487.

The neighbouring districts are Crawley, Mid Sussex, Brighton and Hove, Adur, Arun, Chichester, Waverley and Mole Valley.

==History==
Horsham itself had been an ancient borough from the thirteenth century, but lost its borough status in the 1830s. The town had been made a local government district in 1875, which became Horsham Urban District in 1894.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of seven districts within West Sussex. The new district covered the whole area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chanctonbury Rural District
*Horsham Rural District
*Horsham Urban District
The new district was named Horsham, after its largest settlement.

==Governance==

Horsham District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by West Sussex County Council. Much of the district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and two by-elections in February 2024 the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===
Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 22 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

The council is based at Parkside on Chart Way in Horsham, a modern office building shared with West Sussex County Council; the district council moved into the building in 2015. Previously the council was based across several buildings, including Park House, an eighteenth century house on North Street which had served as the headquarters of the old Horsham Urban District Council since 1928.

==Towns and parishes==

The central part of the Horsham urban area, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 Horsham Urban District, is an unparished area. The rest of the district is divided into civil parishes. None of the parishes has been formally designated a town by its parish council, although Billingshurst, Henfield, Pulborough and Steyning are post towns.

Within the Horsham District are the following civil parishes:
==Education==

The Rikkyo School in England, a Japanese boarding school, is located in the Rudgwick community in Horsham District.

==Parliamentary rules controversies==
===Expenses 2009===
On 25 October 2009 &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; suggested that while the Goudies lived in London, she listed her main residence as a flat in Glasgow when claiming House of Lords expenses. This had resulted in her claiming £230,000 of subsistence allowances intended as payments for those outside the capital, who need help to meet the cost of accommodation in London.

After an investigation ending in December 2010, the Clerk of the Parliaments said that he had doubts about the designation of the Glasgow flat as a main residence, when Goudie had a residence in Belgravia. However, no further action was to be taken; she had apologised in writing and repaid £5,130.50 relating to a period when she was sick and unable to travel. In total, Goudie had claimed about £168,000 in overnight expenses and £82,000 for travel to and from the Glasgow property over a nine-year period. Goudie sold the Glasgow flat in 2010.

===Code of conduct 2022===
On 16 December 2022 the House of Lords Conduct Committee recommended that she be suspended from the House of Lords for six months after it was found that she breached the Code of Conduct by agreeing to provide parliamentary advice in return for payment and also for breaching the rules on the use of the House&#x27;s facilities. Goudie was removed from the Labour Party whip becoming non-affiliated. Her suspension from the Lords began on 11 January 2023. Goudie returned to both Parliament and the Labour whip in July 2023.

==Personal life==
Goudie is married to James, a barrister with whom she has two sons. They live in a home in London and a holiday home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Goudie is a Roman Catholic.

<text>Alopochen is a genus of the bird family Anatidae, part of the subfamily Tadorninae along with the shelducks. It contains one extant species, the Egyptian goose (&quot;Alopochen aegyptiaca&quot;), and three or four species which became extinct in the last 1,000 years or so. The Egyptian goose is native to mainland Africa, and the extinct species are from Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands.

mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data suggest that the relationships of &quot;Alopochen&quot; to &quot;Tadorna&quot; need further investigation.

==Species==

* Egyptian goose (&quot;Alopochen aegyptiaca&quot;)

The extinct species of the genus are:
* Malagasy shelduck or Madagascar shelduck (&quot;Alopochen sirabensis&quot;) (may be a subspecies of &quot;A. mauritiana&quot;) – Madagascar, prehistoric: see Late Quaternary prehistoric birds
* Mauritius sheldgoose (&quot;Alopochen mauritiana&quot;) – Mauritius, late 1690s
* Réunion sheldgoose or Kervazo&#x27;s Egyptian goose (&quot;Alopochen kervazoi&quot;) – Réunion, &quot;circa&quot; 1690s
* &quot;Alopochen tarabukini&quot; 

The generic name looks like Greek ἀλώπηξ + χήν = &quot;fox-goose&quot;, referring to the colour of its back, but with a Greek language error; the linguistically correct form would have been *&quot;Alopecchen&quot; or *&quot;Alopecochen&quot;.

<text>Sarkidiornis is a genus within the family Anatidae comprising two species that inhabit aquatic environments in tropical and subtropical regions of South America, Africa and southern Asia.. &quot;Sarkidiornis&quot; is sometimes considered a monotypic genus with its sole member the knob-billed duck (&quot;S. melanotos&quot;), a cosmopolitan species.

==Taxonomy==
This genus was first described in 1838 by Thomas Campbell Eyton. The type species, &quot;Anser melanotos&quot; (&quot;S. melanotos&quot;), was originally described in 1769 by Thomas Pennant, based on a bird collected in what is now Sri Lanka.

Etymologically, the term Sarkidiornis is derived from Greek, where sarkidion means &quot;little meat&quot; or &quot;caruncle&quot;, and ornis means &quot;bird&quot;. This name refers to the fleshy crest at the base of the male’s beak.

Most taxonomic authorities, however, split the species into two:

<text>Edmund James Flynn (November 16, 1847 – June 7, 1927) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and the tenth premier of Quebec, from 1896 to 1897.

==Background==

Flynn, the son of Jacques Flynn and Elizabeth Tostevin, was born at Percé on November 16, 1847. He studied law at the Université Laval in Quebec City from 1871 to 1873, obtaining his degree with distinction. On 16 Sept. 1873 he was called to the bar of the province of Quebec and he took up his profession in the region where he was born.

==Member of the legislature==

Flynn became the Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Gaspé in 1878. He crossed the floor in 1879 and joined the Conservative Party, a very controversial move at that time, an action which was shocking in the Gaspé riding where he was a favourite son, and a gallant chivalric-like orator on campaign. Flynn won re-election each time until 1890. In that year, Honoré Mercier&#x27;s Parti National won a landslide victory and Flynn lost his seat. Flynn ran for the federal Conservatives in the 1891 federal election for the riding of Quebec County, but lost. Flynn was sent back to the provincial legislature in 1892 and was re-elected in 1897.

==Conservative Leader==

He succeeded Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative Leader, became the tenth Premier of Quebec in 1896. In office he was concerned with public works, Crown Land adjudication and improving the quality of primary education and the compensation for schoolmasters. This short tenure marked the final time that the Conservative Party held power in Quebec.

In the 1897, his government suffered electoral defeat to the more popular Félix-Gabriel Marchand. During the remainder of his term as a legislator, Flynn served as Leader of the Opposition.

==Judge==

Flynn had taught a course in Roman law at Université Laval in Quebec City from the late 1870s. Flynn had been appointed a judge of the Superior Court for the district of Beauce in June 1914. In June 1920 he was appointed Judge of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, an office he held for the rest of his life. Flynn died at Quebec City, June 7, 1927 and his remains were interred in the cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont, Sainte-Foy, Quebec.

A grandson was the Canadian politician Jacques Flynn.

<text>Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh (; 5 September 1861 – 13 May 1922) was an English scholar, poet, and author. Raleigh was also a Cambridge Apostle.

==Biography==
Walter Alexander Raleigh was born in London, the fifth child and only son of a local Congregationalist minister. Raleigh was educated at the City of London School, Edinburgh Academy, University College London, and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

He was Professor of English Literature at the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh in India (1885–87), Professor of Modern Literature at the University College Liverpool (1890–1900), Regius Professor of English Language and Literature at Glasgow University (1900–1904), and in 1904 became the first holder of the Chair of English Literature at Oxford University and he was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford (1914–22). Raleigh was knighted in 1911. Among his works are &quot;Style&quot; (1897), &quot;Milton&quot; (1900) and &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (1907), but in his day he was more renowned as a stimulating if informal lecturer than as a critic.

On the outbreak of World War I, he turned to the war as his primary subject. Raleigh&#x27;s correspondence during the war revealed strong anti-German beliefs: one letter stated &quot;German University Culture is mere evil&quot;, and added that the deaths &quot;of 100 Boche professors ... would be a benefit to the human race&quot;. His finest book may be the first volume of &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1922), whose volumes II to VI (1928–1937, plus 3 volumes of maps) had to be compiled by Henry Albert Jones after Raleigh&#x27;s death.

In 1915, he delivered the Vanuxem lectures at Princeton on &quot;The Origins of Romance&quot; and &quot;The Beginnings of the Romantic Revival,&quot; and lectured on Chaucer at Brown, which gave him the degree of Litt.D.

Raleigh died at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, from typhoid (contracted during a visit to the Near East) on 13 May 1922 (aged 60), being survived by his wife, Lucie Gertrude Jackson (sister-in-law of Catherine Carswell), three of their four sons, and a daughter. His daughter Philippa married the writer Charles Whibley. He is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St. Lawrence at North Hinksey, near Oxford.

His son Hilary edited his light prose, verse and plays in &quot;Laughter from a Cloud&quot; (1923). Raleigh is probably best known for the poem &quot;Wishes of an Elderly Man, Wished at a Garden Party, June 1914&quot;:

Raleigh Park at North Hinksey, near Harcourt Hill where he lived from 1909 to his death, is named after him. The Department of English at Aligarh Muslim University has an active Raleigh Literary Society, which regularly organises performances of scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

<doc id="470826" wikidata="Q131480" url="?curid=470826" title="Camembert">
<text>Camembert ( , , ) is a moist, soft, creamy, surface-ripened cow&#x27;s milk cheese. It was first made in the late 18th century in Camembert, Normandy, in northwest France. It is sometimes compared in look, taste and texture to brie cheese, albeit with a slightly lower butterfat content than brie&#x27;s typical 20% – 25% by weight.

== Production ==
The first camembert was made from unpasteurized milk, and the AOC variety &quot;Camembert de Normandie&quot; (approximately 10% of the production) is required by law to be made only with unpasteurized milk. Many modern cheesemakers outside of Normandy, France, however, use pasteurized milk for reasons of safety, compliance with regulations, or convenience.
The cheese is made by inoculating warmed cow milk with mesophilic bacteria, then adding rennet and allowing the mixture to coagulate. The curd is then cut into roughly 1 cm (1/2 inch) cubes, salted, and transferred to low cylindrical camembert molds. The molds are turned every six to twelve hours to allow the whey to drain evenly from the cut curds; after 48 hours, each mold contains a flat, cylindrical, solid cheese mass weighing generally 250 grams (about 9 oz). At this point the fresh cheese is hard, crumbly, and bland.

The surface of each cheese is then sprayed with an aqueous suspension of the mold &quot;Penicillium camemberti&quot;, and the cheeses are left to ripen for a legally required minimum of three weeks. This affinage produces the distinctive bloomy, edible rind and creamy interior texture characteristic of the cheese. Once the cheeses are sufficiently ripe, they are wrapped in paper and may be placed in wooden boxes for transport.

== History ==

Camembert was reputedly first made in 1791 by Marie Harel, a farmer from Normandy, following advice from Abbot who came from Alençon. She is credited with having refined a previously existing cheese recipe from the Pays d&#x27;Auge region and having launched it into the wider world. She passed her secrets on to her daughter, whose husband, Victor Paynel, presented one of his wife&#x27;s best cheeses to Napoleon III, who gave to it his royal seal of approval.

The origin of the cheese known today as Camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialization of the cheesemaking process at the end of the 19th century. In 1890, an engineer, M. Ridel, devised the wooden box that was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances, in particular to America, where it became very popular. These boxes are still used today.

Before fungi were understood, the colour of Camembert rind was a matter of chance, most commonly blue-grey, with brown spots. From the early 20th century onwards, the rind has been more commonly pure white, but it was not until the mid-1970s that pure white became standard.

The cheese was famously issued to French troops during World War I, becoming firmly fixed in French popular culture as a result. It has many other roles in French culture, literature, and history. It is now internationally known, and many local varieties are made around the world.

The variety named &quot;&quot; was granted a protected designation of origin in 1992 after the original AOC in 1983. The AOC Camembert can only be made from raw, unpasteurized milk from Normandes cows. Problems with hygiene regulations have caused restrictions on importation and sale in some countries, notably the US; a variant made from pasteurized milk is sold in these territories instead.

== Chemical composition ==
Camembert cheese gets its characteristic odor from many compounds. These include diacetyl (buttery flavoring for popcorn), 3-methylbutanal, methional (degradation product of methionine), 1-octen-3-ol and 1-octen-3-one (degradation products of fats), phenethyl acetate, 2-undecanone, δ-decalactone, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid, as well as volatile sulfur compounds such as S-Methyl thioacetate.
Overripe camembert contains an unpleasant, excessive amount of ammonia, which is produced by the same microorganisms required for ripening.

== Comparison to brie ==

Brie and Camembert are two similar soft cheeses that are both made from cow&#x27;s milk. Despite their similarities, there are notable differences between them, including their origin, market shape, size, and flavor.

Brie cheese originates from the Brie while camembert comes from Normandy. Traditionally, Brie was produced in large wheels measuring either 22.9 cm (9 in) or 36.8 cm (14.5 in) in diameter.[1] As a result, Brie takes longer to ripen compared to the smaller Camembert cheeses. When sold, Brie is typically cut into segments from the larger wheels, although some variations of Brie are sold as small, flat cylinders. Consequently, the sides of Brie segments are not covered by the rind. On the other hand, Camembert is ripened as a small round cheese measuring 10.2 cm (4 in) in diameter by 3.2 cm (1.26 in) in thickness, and it is fully covered by its rind. This difference in size and rind coverage gives Camembert a slightly stronger flavor compared to Brie ripened for the same duration. Once the rind is cut on Camembert, it typically emits a more pungent aroma than Brie.

In terms of taste, Camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky flavor. The texture of Camembert is also softer than that of Brie. When warmed, Camembert becomes creamier, while Brie retains more of its structure when heated. These variations contribute to the contrasting characteristics of the two cheeses.

== Packaging ==

Typically camembert tends to be sold whole in thin, round, wooden containers made from poplar. Modern variations in packaging include cartons and tin cans, with a ring-pull tab for opening (Camembert in metallic boxes does not exist on the French market). The cardboard boxes are reserved for the low-cost camemberts. The product is the same as in the wooden container, wrapped dry in a paper/foil wrapper, and not immersed in brine or oil.

== Camembert from other countries==
A similar cheese is produced in Hungary under the same name, the Czech Republic under the name &#x27; and in Slovakia as &#x27; or &quot;&quot;. A Camembert-type cheese is also manufactured in Cornwall, UK, and marketed as &quot;Cornish Camembert&quot;. Fonterra in New Zealand make a variant called Camembert Log. This is a long cylinder that is about in diameter and weighs . Fonterra also make conventional Camembert cheeses under their Mainland, Anchor and Kapiti brand names.

<doc id="470827" wikidata="Q2831920" url="?curid=470827" title="Albion College">
<text>Albion College is a private liberal arts college in Albion, Michigan. The college was founded in 1835 and its undergraduate population was approximately 1,500 students as of Fall 2021.

The college competes in NCAA Division III and the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA).

==History==

On March 23, 1835, Methodist settlers in Spring Arbor Township obtained a charter for a new seminary from the Michigan Territorial Legislature. Construction began in 1837 outside Spring Arbor but the Panic of 1837 ended the project. A petition to move the seminary to Albion was approved by the legislature in 1839.

Sixty acres (243,000 m2) of land were donated by Jesse Crowell to the renamed Wesleyan Seminary, and construction began in 1841. The first classes were held in 1843 in the local Methodist Church. In 1844, classes began in the newly constructed Central Building, rebuilt as the present Robinson Hall in 1907.

The Albion Female Collegiate Institute, founded in 1850, merged in 1857 under the name The Wesleyan Seminary and Female College at Albion; the merger was finalized in 1861, under the name Albion College. The legislature authorized the college to confer full four-year college degrees upon both men and women that same year.

==Academics==

Albion offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business, the humanities, fine arts, natural sciences, and social sciences. It provides study-abroad programs in Europe, Latin America, Israel, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Albion is perhaps best known for its equestrian center, the Nancy G. Held Equestrian Center, and its biology and physical education programs. The three popular first majors, by number of 2021 graduates, were Biology/Biological Sciences (43), Economics (33), and Communication (28).

The Whitehouse Nature Center at Albion works with public schools and the community. It features six miles of trails, 400 plant species, almost 170 bird species, 25 acres of oak-hickory and flood-plain forest, a tall-grass prairie and spring in the Adele D. Whitehouse Wildflower Garden, an arboretum of Michigan trees and shrubs, 34 acres of farmland and research projects, and an interpretative building.

Albion College Astronomical Observatory was built in 1883-84 with encouragement from Samuel Dickie, later the college president.

Since 1990 one student went on to be a Rhodes Scholar, three were Goldwater Scholars, four Truman Scholars and seventeen Fulbright Scholars.

==Astronomical observatory==

Albion College is home to the Prentiss M. Brown Honors Center &amp; Astronomical Observatory, named after Prentiss M. Brown, a U.S. Senator and a U.S. Representative who graduated from Albion College in 1911. The observatory is recognized as a Michigan State Historical Site and is used for both educational purposes and public viewing events, allowing students and community members to observe celestial objects such as planets, stars, and solar events.

One of the notable features of the observatory is the 8.25&quot; Alvan Clark Telescope, which dates back to the late 19th century. Alvan Clark &amp; Sons were renowned telescope makers and the presence of this telescope adds historical and educational value to the observatory. According to &quot;Old Albion&quot;, a college history published in 1909, Alvan Clark himself crafted the Albion telescope, marking it as the last telescope he made before his death. Although this claim remains unverified, Clark&#x27;s health was declining in the early 1880s and the extent of his work in the years leading up to his death in 1887 is not well-documented.

==Athletics==
Albion College is a part of the MIAA Conference. Albion has overall won 173 men&#x27;s MIAA titles (tied for 2nd overall), as well as 26 women&#x27;s MIAA titles (5th overall). Albion won the NCAA Division III football championship in 1994. The Esports team started in the 2021-2022 academic year.

==Demographics==
As of 2021 Fall enrollment, the student body was 53% female and 47% male. 73% of students were Michigan residents, 26% from out-of-state, and 1% from foreign countries. Ninety-eight percent of students are enrolled full-time. The ethnic composition of the student body was as follows:
*White (55%)
*Black/African American (17%)
*Hispanic/Latino (12%)
*Race/Ethnicity Unknown (9%)
*Two or more Races (3%)
*Asian (2%)
*Non-resident Alien (2%)

Prior to the 2010s the enrollment was heavily white and non-low income. The numbers of black and Hispanic students increased, along with those of first-time university students and lower income students, due to a drive to increase and diversify enrollment. Between 2013 and 2020, Albion increased its minority enrollment from 18% to 41%, and 48% of the incoming class in 2020 identified as persons of color.

==Tuition and financial aid==
The total cost of attending Albion full time as of 2022 was $67,310. Albion offers financial aid of some form to 100% of its students. The average financial aid package as of December 2022 was $53,714 per student.

==Greek life==
Albion College is home to six social fraternities and as many sororities. All are members of the North American Interfraternity Conference and all comprise Albion College&#x27;s InterFraternity Council (IFC). The song &quot;Sweetheart of Sigma Chi&quot; was written in 1911 by Byron D. Stokes (Albion, 1913) and F. Dudleigh Vernor (Albion, 1914), and first performed by Harry Clifford (Albion, 1911) while undergraduates at Albion College.

===Professional and honorary fraternities===
Albion College is also home to fifteen honorary, professional, service, and special interest fraternities, including Phi Beta Kappa, established as the Michigan Beta chapter in 1940.

<doc id="470829" wikidata="Q894097" url="?curid=470829" title="Borough of Tunbridge Wells">
<text>The Borough of Tunbridge Wells is a local government district with borough status in Kent, England. It takes its name from its main town, Royal Tunbridge Wells. The borough also contains the towns of Paddock Wood and Southborough, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Large parts of the borough fall within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Malling, Maidstone, Ashford, Rother and Wealden.

==History==
The town of Tunbridge Wells had been governed by improvement commissioners from 1835. The commissioners&#x27; district was reconstituted as a local government district in 1860, which in turn became a municipal borough in 1889. That first borough of Tunbridge Wells was renamed &quot;Royal Tunbridge Wells&quot; in 1909 following a petition from the borough council to Edward VII.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of three former districts and parts of a fourth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cranbrook Rural District
*Tonbridge Rural District (except parishes of Hadlow and Hildenborough, which went to Tonbridge and Malling)
*Royal Tunbridge Wells Municipal Borough
*Southborough Urban District

The new district was named Tunbridge Wells after the area&#x27;s largest town, but without the Royal prefix. The district was not initially granted borough status. The council resolved to petition for it in June 1974 and a borough charter was received on 20 December 1974, allowing the chair of the council to take the title mayor.

==Governance==

Tunbridge Wells Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2024 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Tunbridge Wells. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1998 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:

The next elections are due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council being elected each time for a four year term of office. Kent County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

In the 2016 European Union referendum, Tunbridge Wells was the only district in Kent that voted to remain in the EU (54.89%).

===Premises===
The council is based at Tunbridge Wells Town Hall on Mount Pleasant Road, which had been completed in 1941 for the old Royal Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.

==Geography==
The borough of Tunbridge Wells lies along the south western border of Kent, partly on the northern edge of the Weald, the remainder on the Weald Clay plain in the upper reaches of the rivers Teise and Beult.

Much of the borough lies within the High Weald, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The presence of sandstone outcrops and the chalybeate springs, together with old workings, point to ancient iron manufacturing in the area.

The Weald Clay plain along the northern edge of the borough forms part of the so-called &quot;Garden of England&quot;, named for its extensive orchards and former hop farms, sheep and cattle. A string of villages lies across this plain, from Brenchley and Horsmonden to Benenden and Headcorn.

==Transport==
The main roads through the borough are the A21 London to Hastings road and in the east, the A229, which runs from the A21 at Hurst Green through Cranbrook to Maidstone.

There is a railway line across the clay plain in an almost unbroken straight line between Redhill, Tonbridge and Ashford, Kent. The SER line to Hastings passes through Tunbridge Wells; here there was once a further branch connection south-eastwards to Groombridge, and at Paddock Wood is the southern terminus of the Medway Valley Line to Maidstone.

==Media==
The BBC has its regional centre at the Great Hall on Mount Pleasant Road in Royal Tunbridge Wells. It is the base of BBC Radio Kent and for BBC South East regional programmes, the complex contains studios and offices. ITV Meridian also covers the area but broadcast from its studios in Whiteley in Hampshire. Other radio stations that broadcast to the area are Heart South, Gold, and community based radio stations: KMFM West Kent and West Kent Radio. The area is served by the local newspaper, Kent and Sussex Courier.

==Places of interest==
Apart from Tunbridge Wells itself, places of interest in the Borough include:
* Bedgebury Pinetum
* Bewl Water reservoir near Lamberhurst for leisure water pursuits and outdoor conferences
* Sissinghurst Castle gardens: the home of Vita Sackville-West
* facilities for rock-climbing at the &#x27;High Rocks&#x27;, 2 miles west of Tunbridge Wells

<doc id="470833" wikidata="Q737114" url="?curid=470833" title="Borough of Maidstone">
<text>The Borough of Maidstone is a local government district with borough status in Kent, England. Its administrative centre is Maidstone, the county town of Kent.

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the municipal borough of Maidstone with the rural districts of Maidstone and Hollingbourne, under the Local Government Act 1972.

==Position==
The borough covers an area generally to the east and south of the town of Maidstone: as far north as the M2 motorway; east down the M20 to Lenham; south to a line including Staplehurst and Headcorn; and west towards Tonbridge. Generally speaking, it lies between the North Downs and the Weald, and covers the central part of the county. The M20 motorway crosses it from west to east, as does High Speed 1.

Geologically, the Greensand Ridge lies to the south of the town. The very fine sand provides a good source for glass-making. The clay vale beyond, through which flow the three rivers which meet at Yalding (the Medway, the Beult and the Teise), and the chalk North Downs all provide raw materials for paper- and cement-making; which are also local industries.

==Governance==
Maidstone Borough represents the second tier of local government, being one of the local government districts of Kent. The Borough Council consists of 49 councillors, representing voters from 22 wards. Twelve of those wards are within the urban area of Maidstone: they are Allington; Bridge; Downswood &amp; Otham; Fant; Heath; Grove Green and Vinters Park; High Street; North ward; Park Wood; Penden Heath; Shepway North; Shepway South; and South ward. The remaining 14 wards cover rural districts.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2023. Following the 2024 election, a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Greens and four of the independent councillors formed to run the council, led by Green councillor Stuart Jeffery.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been held by the following parties: 
===Leadership===
The role of Mayor of Maidstone is largely ceremonial, usually being held by a different councillor each year. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1987 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was as follows:
Four of the independent councillors sit with the Greens as the &#x27;Green and Independent Alliance&#x27;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats. The other two independents sit with local party the Fant &amp; Oakwood Independents as the &#x27;Independent and Fant &amp; Oakwood Independents Group&#x27;. The next election is due in May 2028.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024, 49 councillors have been elected from 26 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

Council meetings are held at Maidstone Town Hall in the High Street. The council has its main offices at Maidstone House (formerly called Maidstone Gateway) on King Street in the centre of Maidstone.

==Parishes==
The third tier of local government is the civil parish; in Maidstone some of the parishes have neither a parish council nor a parish meeting, as indicated (1):

==Transport==

===Water===
The River Medway was the earliest form of transport through the area. It was navigable for cargo-carrying craft as far upstream as Tonbridge, and it was only in the 19th century that the railways brought any change. More recently, various works have been carried out to control the frequent flooding in the clay vale upstream of Maidstone.

===Roads===
Maidstone, as its importance warranted, has been the hub of roads for many centuries. It lies very close to the Pilgrims&#x27; Way; and two Roman roads met south of the town: one from Rochester to Hastings the other branching off to the East Kent coast and Dover.

In the 18th century came the turnpiked roads. One of the earliest in the county – that to Rochester and Chatham – was opened in 1728.

In modern times, two motorways – the M2 and the M20 – pass to the far north of the borough and just north of the town centre of Maidstone respectively.

===Railways===
The earliest line through Kent was built by the South Eastern Railway. It was not, however, built to pass through Maidstone: instead, a station was built at Paddock Wood railway station, then named &quot;Maidstone Road&quot;, some six miles away. It was only in the period between 1844 (when that main line was connected by a branch line to Maidstone) and 1884 that Maidstone became a hub once more, although with local trains only, to Strood, Ashford and via Swanley Junction to London.

==Media==
===Television===
The area is served by the regional news programmes:
*&quot;BBC South East Today&quot;
*&quot;ITV News Meridian&quot;
===Radio===
Radio stations that broadcast to the area are:
*BBC Radio Kent
*Heart South
*Gold Radio 
*KMFM Maidstone 
===Newspapers===
The area is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Kent Messenger&quot;.

<doc id="470835" wikidata="Q208834" url="?curid=470835" title="René Préval">
<text>René Garcia Préval (; 17 January 1943 – 3 March 2017) was a Haitian politician and agronomist who twice was President of Haiti, from early 1996 to early 2001, and again from mid-2006 to mid-2011. He was also Prime Minister from early to late 1991 under the presidency of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

In addition to being the first elected head of state since independence to serve a full term, the first to be elected to full terms of office without succeeding, the first to peacefully transfer power, and the first former prime minister to be elected president, Préval was also the first elected head of state in Haitian history to do so.

Préval promoted privatization of government companies, agrarian reform, and investigations of human rights abuses. His presidencies were marked by domestic tumult and attempts at economic stabilization, with his latter term seeing the destruction brought by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

==Early life and career==
Préval was born on 17 January 1943 in Port-au-Prince and was raised in his father&#x27;s hometown of Marmelade, a village town in the Artibonite department. He studied agronomy at the College of Gembloux and the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and also studied geothermal sciences at the University of Pisa in Pisa, Italy. He left Haiti with his family in 1963.

His father Claude Préval, an agronomist also, had risen to the position of Minister of Agriculture in the government of Général Paul Magloire, the predecessor of Duvalier. Leaving Haiti because his political past presented him as a potential opponent, Claude found work with UN agencies in Africa.

After spending five years in Brooklyn, New York, occasionally working as a restaurant waiter, Préval returned to Haiti and obtained a position with the National Institute for Mineral Resources. In 1988, he opened a bakery in Port-au-Prince with some business partners. While operating his company, he continued to be active in political circles and charity work, such as providing bread to the orphanage of Salesian Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, with whom he developed a close relationship. After the election of Aristide as president in 1990, Préval served as his prime minister from 13 February to 11 October 1991, going into exile following the 30 September 1991 military coup.

On 6 December 2009, Préval married Elisabeth Débrosse Delatour — one of his economic advisors and widow of Leslie Delatour, the former governor of Haiti&#x27;s central bank. Préval&#x27;s first and second marriages, to Guerda Benoit and Solange Lafontant respectively, both ended in divorce.

==First presidency (1996–2001)==
In 1996, Préval was elected as president for a five-year term, with 88% of the popular vote. Upon his 1996 inauguration, Préval became the second democratically elected head of state in the country&#x27;s 191-year history as an independent nation. In 2001, he became the first elected (and second overall) President of Haiti to leave office as a result of the natural expiration of an uninterrupted term.

As president, Préval instituted a number of economic reforms, most notably the privatization of various government companies. By the end of Préval&#x27;s term, unemployment rates had fallen. Préval also instituted a program of agrarian reform in Haiti&#x27;s countryside. His presidency, however, was also marked by fierce political clashes with a parliament dominated by opposition party members (OPL) and an increasingly vocal Fanmi Lavalas, which opposed the structural adjustment and privatization program of Préval&#x27;s government. Préval was a strong supporter of investigations and trials related to human rights violations committed by military and police personnel. He dissolved the parliament in 1999 and ruled by decree for the duration of the final year of his presidency.

==Second presidency (2006–2011)==
===Election===
Préval ran again as the Lespwa candidate in the presidential election of 2006. The election took place after two years of international peacekeeping. Partial election results, released on 9 February, indicated that he had won with about 60% of the vote, but as further results were released, his share of the vote slipped just below the 50% required majority to be elected outright – thus making a run-off necessary.

Several days of popular demonstrations in favour of Préval followed in Port-au-Prince and other cities in Haiti. Préval claimed that there had been fraud among the vote counts, and demanded that he be declared the winner outright of the first round. Protesters paralyzed the capital with burning barricades and stormed a luxury hotel — Hotel Montana, located in the affluent suburb of Pétion-Ville — to demand results from Haiti&#x27;s nearly week-old election as the then ex-President Préval fell further below the 50% needed to win the presidency. On 16 February 2006, Préval was declared the winner of the presidential election by the Provisional Electoral Council with 51.15% of the vote, after the exclusion of &quot;blank&quot; ballots from the count.

Préval was sworn in on 14 May, following Haiti&#x27;s legislative run-off vote in April; he could not be sworn in until a sitting Parliament was in place. When he was sworn in, Préval emphasized the importance of unity, saying that division was Haiti&#x27;s &quot;main problem&quot; and that Haitians had to &quot;work together&quot;. On May 17, he nominated Jacques-Édouard Alexis, who had served as prime minister during Préval&#x27;s first term, as prime minister again. After taking office, Préval immediately signed an oil deal with Venezuela and travelled to the United States, Cuba, and France.

Préval drew much of his support from Haiti&#x27;s poorest people; he was especially widely supported in the poorest neighbourhoods of Port-au-Prince. However, many of the poor demanded that former President Aristide be allowed to return and that civil enterprise workers fired by the Latortue government be reinstated. This caused increasing tension in the slums of Port-au-Prince. Préval promised to build a massive road system which would boost trade and transportation around the country.

===Latin American integration===


Haiti under Préval cooperated diplomatically and fraternally with other nations in Latin America. Haiti&#x27;s Latin American alliance provides the country with much of its needed aid. The friendship between the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and the Haitian president resulted in various economic agreements. Four power plants (a 40-megawatt, a 30-megawatt, and two 15-megawatts) are set to be built in Haiti. An oil refinery is also scheduled to be installed, with a production capacity of of oil per day. Venezuela&#x27;s aid to Haiti is founded upon their historic cooperation, wherein the newly independent Haiti welcomed and tended to Simón Bolívar and provided military power to aid Bolivar&#x27;s cause of Latin American independence from Spain.

Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro and other Cuban diplomats such as Vice President Esteban Lazo Hernández thanked Haiti for consistently voting in the United Nations General Assembly against the United States embargo against Cuba.

Préval&#x27;s diplomatic relations with fellow Latin American nations opened up many economic opportunities for Haiti. Préval met with many Latin American leaders such as Fidel Castro, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Martín Torrijos of Panama, and Leonel Fernández of the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Relations with the Dominican Republic were strengthened largely due to Préval&#x27;s willingness to end volatile temperaments and to the two presidents&#x27; focus on cooperation. The Dominican Republic was Préval&#x27;s first foreign visit as head of state. Préval then visited the United States, where he was congratulated by U.S. President George W. Bush on his reelection. Préval proclaimed that following the Dominican Republic, the U.S. would be his first diplomatic visit in office, putting it ahead of his eventual diplomatic visits to Venezuela, Cuba and France. The U.S. considered Préval&#x27;s meeting with Bush a good sign of excellent US-Haitian relations during the George W. Bush administration.

===April 2008 riots===
In early April 2008, riots broke out over the high cost of food; since 2007, prices for a number of essential foods, including rice, had risen by about 50%. As the riots continued, rioters attacked the presidential palace on 8 April but were driven away by UN soldiers. On 9 April, Préval called for calm; he said that high food prices were a problem around the world, but that the problem would not be solved by destroying stores, and he said that he had &quot;ordered Haitian police and UN soldiers to put an end to the looting&quot;. Despite demands for all taxes on food imports to be lifted, Préval said that he could not do so because the money was greatly needed; he pledged to increase food production in Haiti so that the country would not be so dependent on imports, but this fell short of what many protesters demanded. On 12 April, the Senate voted to remove Prime Minister Alexis from office, and Préval announced that the price per 23 kg of rice would be reduced from $51 to $43. According to Préval, the rice would be subsidized with international aid, and the private sector was willing to reduce the price by $3. He also said that he was going to seek Venezuelan assistance in improving the economic situation.

===2010 earthquake===

On 12 January, Port-au-Prince was hit by an earthquake. Initial reports indicated that diplomats were unable to contact President Préval and they feared he might be trapped beneath the rubble of his home. However, later reports – including ones quoting the Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Alcide Joseph – said that the President and First Lady Elisabeth Delatour Préval had escaped unharmed and had been moved to a safe location on the island. The couple was about to enter their home when the earthquake struck. Préval and his wife were able to step away from the building before the house collapsed, escaping injury.

Much of the Haitian government, including President Préval, relocated to a police barracks near Toussaint Louverture International Airport. The death toll estimates range from 100,000 to 316,000 people. Following the earthquake, President Préval was criticized internationally for his allegedly weak disaster response; his critics included U.S. Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN).

==Post-presidency and death==
Préval retired to his home in Marmelade, where he worked on projects which included an agricultural co-operative, an education centre and a juice factory. His last public appearance was at the inauguration of Jovenel Moïse on 7 February 2017.

Préval&#x27;s death was announced on 3 March 2017, by Moïse, on his Twitter account. Family friends announced that Préval had died on the way to a suburban hospital in Port-au-Prince. His cause of death was initially announced as a cardiac arrest, but rumours of foul play resulted in an autopsy, conducted in front of District Attorney Danton Leger, at the request of Elisabeth Delatour. The autopsy was inconclusive but ruled out a brain haemorrhage or stroke. Further testing of specimens from Préval&#x27;s body was announced by Leger, potentially sending the tissue to a foreign lab.

Préval&#x27;s body lay in state at Musée du Panthéon National on the Champ de Mars, and a state funeral and Catholic mass were held at the Kiosque Occide Jeanty amphitheatre. Patricia Préval, his younger daughter, eulogized her father. Former presidents Jocelerme Privert, Michel Martelly and Prosper Avril were in attendance with foreign diplomatic corps. His body was transported to Marmelade, where he was buried to a three-gun salute.

<text>Dorothea Glenys Thornton, Baroness Thornton (born 16 October 1952), known as Glenys Thornton, is a British politician serving as a Member of the House of Lords since 1998. A member of the Labour and Co-operative parties, she was a Government Whip and Health Minister between 2008 and 2010.

==Career==
Thornton was raised in Bradford, and graduated from the London School of Economics. She was Political Secretary of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society from 1981, joining the public affairs team of the Co-operative Wholesale Society upon their merger in 1985 and working there until 1992. She was General Secretary of the Fabian Society from 1993 to 1996. Since June 2015 she has been Chief Executive of the Young Foundation.

On 23 July 1998 Thornton was created a Life peer by Tony Blair, with the title Baroness Thornton, of Manningham in the County of West Yorkshire. She chaired the Social Enterprise Coalition until January 2008, when she was appointed a junior minister of the House of Lords. In September 2007, she was made chair of the advisory group that trains public sector staff to work with the voluntary sector. In May 2012, her role in Labour was moved from health to equalities, with her role on the health portfolio being taken over by Lord Hunt.

In 2019, she welcomed the Equality and Human Rights Commission response to complaints by the Jewish Labour Movement and Campaign Against Antisemitism about alleged antisemitism in the Labour Party in a tweet to Kate Osamor MP, confusing her with another female black MP, Dawn Butler, the Shadow Women &amp; Equalities Secretary.

==Personal life==
Thornton lives in Gospel Oak, North London, and is married to John Carr. They have two adult children.

She is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.

In 2009, she was reported to be claiming £22,000 a year in expenses by saying that her mother&#x27;s bungalow in Yorkshire is her main home, amounting to around £130,000 between 2002 and 2009. She was later cleared of any wrongdoing by Michael Pownall, the Clerk of Parliaments, after it was determined that she spent much of her time there while caring for her mother.

<text>The fight-or-flight or the fight-flight-freeze-or-fawn (also called hyperarousal or the acute stress response) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1915. His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing. More specifically, the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine and epinephrine. The hormones estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, also affect how organisms react to stress. The hormone osteocalcin might also play a part.

This response is recognised as the first stage of the general adaptation syndrome that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.
==Name==
Originally understood as the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response in Cannon&#x27;s research, the state of hyperarousal results in several responses beyond fighting or fleeing. This has led people to calling it the &quot;fight, flight, freeze&quot; response, &quot;fight-flight-freeze-fawn&quot;
 or &quot;fight-flight-faint-or-freeze&quot;, among other variants. 

The wider array of responses, such as freezing, flop, faint, flee and fright, has led researchers to use more neutral or accommodating terminology such as &quot;hyperarousal&quot; or the &quot;acute stress response&quot;.

==Physiology ==

===Autonomic nervous system===

The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response and its role is mediated by two different components: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.

====Sympathetic nervous system====

The sympathetic nervous system originates in the spinal cord and its main function is to activate the arousal responses that occur during the fight-or-flight response. The sympathetic nervous system transfers signals from the dorsal hypothalamus, which activates the heart, increases vascular resistance, and increases blood flow, especially to the muscle, heart, and brain tissues. It activates the adrenal medulla, releasing catecholamines that amplify the sympathetic response. Additionally, this component of the autonomic nervous system utilizes and activates the release of norepinephrine by the adrenal glands in the reaction.

====Parasympathetic nervous system====

The parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral spinal cord and medulla, physically surrounding the sympathetic origin, and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. It is known as the calming portion of the autonomic nervous system. While the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the parasympathetic nervous system decreases its response. Efferent vagal fibers originating from the nucleus ambiguous fire in parallel to the respiratory system, decreasing the vagal cardiac parasympathetic tone. After the fight or flight response, the parasympathetic system&#x27;s main function is to activate the &quot;rest and digest&quot; response and return the body to homeostasis. This system utilizes and activates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

===Reaction===
The reaction begins in the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH. The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone epinephrine. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system.

The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose. Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.

Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action.

===Function of physiological changes===
The physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:

* Increased blood flow to the muscles activated by diverting blood flow from other parts of the body to make taking quick action easier.
* Increased blood pressure and heart rate enhance cardiac output in order to supply the body with more energy.
* The liver secretes increased amounts of glucose (through adrenaline-induced glycogenolysis) and fats into the blood to provide the body with a fuel source to meet energy demands.
* The respiratory rate increases to supply the oxygen necessary to help burn the extra glucose.
* The blood clotting function of the body speeds up in order to reduce bleeding and prevent excessive blood loss in the event of an injury sustained during the response.
* Increased muscle tension in order to provide the body with extra speed and strength, which can result in trembling or shaking until the tension is released.
* The pupils dilate to let in more light, allowing for better vision of the body&#x27;s surroundings.

==Emotional components==

===Emotion regulation===

In the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used proactively to avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal. Emotional socialization can develop someone&#x27;s ability to successfully regulate their emotions. Faced with a perceived threat (in the context of a fight or flight situation) those raised with supportive parental behaviors are far more likely to easily self-regulate their emotions.

===Emotional reactivity===
During the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response. In a experiment conducted by Clayton, Lang, Leshner and Quick (2019), they viewed the responses of 49 participants to antitobacco messages. Participants reacted in two orders of fashion after seeing the message with the individual smoker and their affects on those surrounding them. The first reaction was participants who had higher defense mechanisms, who decided to ignore the messages, while the other participants who had lower defense mechanisms, ended up arguing and becoming frustrated after viewing the antitobacco messages. Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity (Such as an anxiety disorder) may be prone to anxiety and aggression, which illustrates the implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.

==Cognitive components==

===Content specificity===
The specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterised by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words. There also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.

===Perception of control===

Perceived control relates to an individual&#x27;s thoughts about control over situations and events. Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual&#x27;s beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and aggression.

===Social information processing===

The social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts. The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.

==Other animals==

===Evolutionary perspective===
An evolutionary psychology explanation is that early animals had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided them with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.

===Examples===
A typical example of the stress response is a grazing zebra. If the zebra sees a lion closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated as a means to escape its predator. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the body&#x27;s systems. The sympathetic nervous system&#x27;s activation provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, piloerection (hair standing on end), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal. Note that the zebra and cat still maintain homeostasis in all states.

In July 1992, &quot;Behavioral Ecology&quot; published experimental research conducted by biologist Lee A. Dugatkin where guppies were sorted into &quot;bold&quot;, &quot;ordinary&quot;, and &quot;timid&quot; groups based upon their reactions when confronted by a smallmouth bass (i.e. inspecting the predator, hiding, or swimming away) after which the guppies were left in a tank with the bass. After 60 hours, 40 percent of the timid guppies and 15 percent of the ordinary guppies survived while none of the bold guppies did.

===Varieties of responses===
Animals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.

Other animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of cold-blooded animals change color swiftly to camouflage themselves. These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place, and fight and flight are often combined in a given situation.

The fight or flight actions also have polarity – the individual can either fight against or flee from something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.

A threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.

==In criminal law==
Acute stress response is a common issue in self-defense criminal cases. Expert opinions are usually required if the defender&#x27;s fault becomes the focus of the case.

<text>An opinion piece is an article, usually published in a newspaper or magazine, that mainly reflects the author&#x27;s opinion about a subject. Opinion pieces are featured in many periodicals.

==Editorials==

Opinion pieces may take the form of an editorial, usually written by the senior editorial staff or publisher of the publication, in which case the opinion piece is usually unsigned and may be supposed to reflect the opinion of the periodical. In major newspapers, such as the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, editorials are classified under the heading &quot;opinion.&quot;

==Columns==

Other opinion pieces may be written by a (regular or guest) columnist. Such pieces, referred to as &quot;columns&quot;, may be strongly opinionated, and the opinion expressed is that of the writer (and not the periodical). However, not all columns are opinion pieces; for example, columnists may write columns that are nonsensical and solely intended for their humouristic effect.

==Op-eds==

An op-ed (abbreviated from &quot;opposite the editorial page&quot;) is an opinion piece that appears on a page in the newspaper dedicated solely to them, often written by a subject-matter expert, a person with a unique perspective on an issue, or a regular columnist employed by the paper.

<doc id="470851" wikidata="Q764999" url="?curid=470851" title="Space (French band)">
<text>Space (occasionally Didier Marouani &amp; Space), are a French music band active from 1977 through 1980 and returning with on-stage remake performances since 1982. Their work is associated with the short-lived space disco genre and is a precursor of electronica.

==History==
===Instant success and breakup===
Space was founded in 1977 by Didier Marouani (also known as Ecama). The band consisted of Didier Marouani, arrangers Roland Romanelli and Jannick Top, and singer Madeline Bell. Marouani by that time had some fame as a solo pop singer, but soon focused on his band, whose name was suggested by the song “Magic Fly”, originally written in 1976 for a television program dedicated to astrology.

Didier Marouani: “Given the words of people who constantly told me that the melody resembles the sounds coming from space, I chose “Space” as the name&quot;.

In the early period, musicians strongly emphasized the sci-fi orientation of their group, often performing in stage costumes like spacesuits. Another reason for appearing in public in the form of &quot;astronauts&quot; was the current contract of Didier Marouani with the company &quot;Polydor&quot;.

D. Marouani: “The producer and I invited my record company to release “Magic Fly” under my name, but the label decided that the composition was not good enough to do this ... My producer found another company, but I could not “light up” under in my own name, since the contract with my company remained in force... The suits appeared also because no one could recognize me in it. I had to come up with a creative pseudonym, and I settled on “Ecama”.

The first three albums — &quot;Magic Fly&quot; (1977), &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1977) and &quot;Just Blue&quot; (1978) — sold over 12 million records globally. After the recording of Magic Fly, American drummer Joe Hammer joined the band.

However, after &quot;Just Blue&quot; was released, a critical moment occurred in the group’s history related to the increasing desire of its leader to perform concerts (previously impossible due to the imperfection of available synthesizer models), which led to a conflict with producer Jean-Philippe Iliesco.

D. Marouani: “... Everything was going well, but at that time, when I met with my producer, I told him about my desire to perform on stage. At that time, we did not have a single “live” performance, only television. I managed to get permission for a concert under the Eiffel Tower, with the support of (radio station) “Europe 1”, and the press too, but in the end, my producer decided to cancel everything. And then I said: “I&#x27;m leaving,” because — a group that does not give concerts will die sooner or later&quot;.

Didier Marouani left the band in 1979, and Joe Hammer went on to do other projects, Romanelli and Jannick Top continued and released the album &quot;Deeper Zone&quot; in 1980. The band split up in 1981.

From 1982 Marouani and Joe Hammer performed and recorded as &quot;Didier Marouani &amp; Space&quot; with Janny Loseth of Titanic as lead vocalist. The band was later renamed Paris-France-Transit in response to legal action. Hammer left in 1992.

===The return of &quot;spAce&quot; and beyond===
The name &quot;spAce&quot; was legally re-acquired after copyright disputes around 1990, allowing Didier Marouani to re-release classic albums and give a European live cover tour in 1993. &quot;Symphonic Space Dream&quot; was produced with collaboration from the Russian State Symphony Orchestra. In the same year, the S Club Juniors made a remix to their single &quot;New Direction&quot; featuring the backing track of &quot;Magic Fly&quot;. The band&#x27;s hit &quot;Magic Fly&quot; as well as many other songs from the self-named album were remixed in 2003 by the Belgian dance music project Minimalistix. In 2004, their hit &quot;Deliverance&quot; was sampled in De La Soul&#x27;s single Rock Co.Kane Flow featuring MF Doom. In 2007, it was retaken to feature in its entirety in Talib Kweli&#x27;s two-piece composition &quot;Hostile Gospel (Deliver Us)&quot;. 2011 saw the release of Space&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;From Earth To Mars&quot;. The last track of this album, &quot;Message of Peace From Earth To Mars&quot;, features recorded samples of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s journey into space in 1961 and is a tribute to fifty years of space exploration.

<text>Viscount Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The title was created in 1918 for Ivor Guest, 2nd Baron Wimborne. The Guest family descends from the engineer and businessman John Josiah Guest. On 14 August 1838, he was created a baronet, of Dowlais in the County of Glamorgan, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baronet. In 1880, he was created Baron Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the second Baron. In 1910, four years before he succeeded his father, he had been raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Ashby St Ledgers, of Ashby St Ledgers in the County of Northampton. Upon his retirement as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1918, he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Viscount, represented Breconshire in the House of Commons. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1993.

Several other members of the Guest family have also gained distinction. Montague Guest, third son of the first Baronet, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. Frederick Edward Guest, Henry Guest and Oscar Guest, younger sons of the first Baron, were all prominent politicians. Also, Lady Charlotte Guest was the second wife of the first Baronet.

In 1867, the first Baron bought a large house at 22 Arlington Street in London, which remained the family&#x27;s London residence until 1947.

*Sir John Josiah Guest, 1st Baronet (1785–1852)
*Sir Ivor Bertie Guest, 2nd Baronet (1835–1914) (created Baron Wimborne in 1880)

==Barons Wimborne (1880)==

*Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne (1835–1914)
*Ivor Churchill Guest, 2nd Baron Wimborne (1873–1939) (created Baron Ashby St Ledgers in 1910; created Viscount Wimborne in 1918)

<doc id="470858" wikidata="Q1426630" url="?curid=470858" title="Flag of Nunavut">
<text>The official flag of Nunavut was proclaimed on 1 April 1999, along with the territory of Nunavut in Canada. It features a red inuksuk—a traditional Inuit land marker—and a blue star, which represents &quot;Niqirtsuituq&quot; (or “Niqirtsituk”), the North Star, and the leadership of elders in the community. The colours blue and gold represent the riches of the land, sea and sky. It was adopted following a process where input was sought from local communities and submissions were solicited from the Canadian public.

==Symbolism==
The flag of the Canadian territory of Nunavut consists of gold and white fields divided vertically by a red inuksuk with a blue star in the . The colours blue and gold were selected to represent the &quot;riches of land, sea, and sky&quot;, while red is used to represent Canada as a whole. The inuksuk, which divides the flag, is a traditional stone monument used to guide travellers and to mark sacred sites. In the upper fly, the blue star represents the North Star (Niqirtsituk / Niqirtsuituq), an important object due to its key role as a navigational beacon, and as symbolically representing the wisdom and leadership of community elders.

===Colour scheme===
The flag of Nunavut has the following four primary colours and black outlining the inuksuk;

==History==
The process of creating a flag for Nunavut began prior to its creation as a territory in 1999. This created significant excitement in the vexillographic community, as it was the first change in the map of Canada since Newfoundland became a province in 1949 and was being created in a region with little flag history. In deference to the elders of the Inuit communities of Nunavut, the development of both the Nunavut flag and coat of arms was guided by their input. The process sought to give the public an opportunity to offer input into the colours and symbolism of the flag as well as to give local artists an opportunity to participate. Led by the Chief Herald of Canada, a group developing the flag visited a number of communities to seek input and learn about Inuit culture, including Rankin Inlet, Baker Lake, Kinngait, Iqaluit, and Pangnirtung.

The group then put out a call for submissions across all of Canada, and received over 800. These submissions were reviewed and winnowed by a committee made up of artists and local elders who chose ten finalists. From the symbols and colours of these ten finalists, five draft designs of the flag were developed. They were assisted in drafting these by local Inuit artist Andrew Qappik. The final version of the flag was reviewed and accepted by the commission responsible for its adoption as well as the Governor General of Canada and Queen Elizabeth II. It was officially unveiled on 1 April 1999, the day when both the territory and government of Nunavut became official.

The layout and colouring of the flag have aroused some marginal criticism, which nonetheless recognized the valuable cultural symbolism included in the design.

<text>Didier &quot;Ecama&quot; Marouani (born 14 July 1953) is a French composer and musician born in Monaco.

== Biography ==
Didier started his career as a pop singer and made his first single, &quot;Je suis ton chevalier&quot; with Etienne Roda-Gil as a lyricist in 1975. He followed this by touring with Johnny Hallyday, Claude François and Joe Dassin. In 1977, he formed the band Space and composed all the songs on these albums under the pseudonym Ecama. The title track from the first album, &quot;Magic Fly&quot; reached number 2 on the U.K. Singles Chart and was used as the main theme song of the original Chinese version of Jackie Chan&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (蛇形刁手). This was followed by the albums &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1977), &quot;Just Blue&quot; (1978). In 1980 he quit from the band Space after a dispute with producer Jean-Phillip Illiesco. Later, he participated in another electronic venture &quot;Paris-France-Transit&quot; (1982). In 1983, Didier &amp; Space went to the USSR to give 21 concerts for 600,000 people. In 1992, Didier was able to obtain the necessary authorization for a concert in the Red Square in Moscow. Some 360,000 spectators attended this free concert.

Throughout the 1980s, Didier Marouani and Space maintained quite a large popularity in France and many European socialist republics including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Soviet Union. In 1987, Didier composed a new album &quot;Space Opera&quot;, the first opera composed for synthesizers and choirs. He was able to obtain the participation of both the Red Army Choirs and the Harvard University Choirs (USA) for his album. The album was relayed to the Soviet space station Mir, making the album the first compact disc to be heard in space. The CD had been launched into space together with a CD player with the Russian cosmonauts. &quot;Space Opera&quot; went on to achieve great success in Europe.

In 2001, the new Space album &quot;Symphonic Space Dream&quot; was performed as a premiere in Kyiv at the Palace &quot;Ukraine&quot; with the participation of the National Symphonic Orchestra of Ukraine with 110 musicians. In 2002, they performed in Moscow at the Kremlin Theater with a capacity of 6,000 people with the participation of the Presidential Symphonic Orchestra. This was followed by a performance in St. Petersburg attended by over 12,000 people. The song &quot;New Direction [Magic Fly Radio Version]&quot; incorporated elements of the track &quot;Magic Fly&quot; performed by U.K. pop group S Club Juniors on their &quot;Together&quot; CD.

In 2015, Didier performed as a special guest on a music show &quot;Znamenie&quot; together with Evgeny Khmara in October Palace, Kyiv.

In 2009, a huge concert was held in Moscow at the Olympisky Stadium. In October 2009, Nang Records in England released a &quot;Best of Space&quot; CD, completely remastered with 14 tracks, followed by a remix album the following month.

=== Controversy ===
On 29 November 2016, Russian media reported that Marouani has been detained in Moscow by Russian police following a complaint by Philip Kirkorov with whom Marouani had a disagreement regarding a copyright infringement case. He was released the following day.

=== Honors ===
On 14 May 2021, asteroid 275215 Didiermarouani was in his honor by the Working Group for Small Bodies Nomenclature. The main-belt asteroid was discovered by astronomer Timur Krjačko at the Zelenchukskaya Station in 2009.

<text>Margaret Lucy Sharp, Baroness Sharp of Guildford (born 21 November 1938) is a former member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. She sat as a Liberal Democrat.

==Early life==
She is the daughter of Osmund and Sydney Hailstone. She was educated at Tonbridge Grammar School and Newnham College, Cambridge where she gained a BA in 1960.

==Career==
She had a successful career as an economist before entering the House of Lords. Sharp&#x27;s work encompassed both academic and public service, starting in the civil service, followed by a long spell at the London School of Economics (LSE), a short spell back in public service with the National Economic Development Office in the late 1970s and, since the early 1980s, with the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex. She retired from the University of Sussex in 1999 but retains a visiting fellowship.

Sharp&#x27;s political career began in the early 1980s when she joined the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) and was selected to stand in Guildford in the 1983 general election. She fought three further elections in Guildford for the SDP and then the Liberal Democrats, gradually squeezing a 20,000 majority down to 4,500 and preparing the way for Liberal Democrat Sue Doughty&#x27;s victory in the 2001 election.

On the national scene she has played an active part in policy making, chairing a number of policy working groups and for several years being vice-chair to Paddy Ashdown on the Party&#x27;s main policy committee.

As leader of higher and further education policy group, who produced the paper &#x27;Quality, Diversity and Choice&#x27; which is now party policy, Sharp was widely attributed as masterminding the Liberal Democrat&#x27;s rejection of top-up fees, which contributed to the party&#x27;s success in taking a number of university seats at the 2005 general election.

She is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

==House of Lords==
She was created a Life peer as Baroness Sharp of Guildford, of Guildford in the County of Surrey on 1 August 1998, and spoke for her party on issues of education, science, and technology in the House of Lords. She retired from the House on 31 July 2016.

==Personal life==
She married Thomas Sharp CBE in 1962. He has been a Lib Dem councillor on Surrey County Council and Guildford Borough Council.

His son, the fourth Viscount, was a prominent Conservative politician. In 1992, five years before he succeeded his father, he was created a life peer as Baron Younger of Prestwick, of Ayr in the District of Kyle and Carrick. , the titles are held by his son, the fifth Viscount, who succeeded in 2003 and joined the House of Lords as an elected hereditary peer in 2010.

<text>Pietro Antonio Locatelli (3 September 1695 in Bergamo – 30 March 1764 in Amsterdam) was an Italian Baroque composer and violinist.

==Biography==
===Bergamo===
Little is known about Locatelli&#x27;s childhood. In his early youth, he was the third violinist and held the title of &quot;virtuoso&quot; in the &quot;cappella musicale&quot; (musical establishment) of the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo. His first violin teachers were probably Ludovico Ferronati and Carlo Antonio Marino, both of whom were members of the &quot;cappella&quot;. The &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;, Francesco Ballarotti, may have taught him composition. In autumn 1711 Locatelli went to Rome to seek greater recognition.

===Rome===
Locatelli began studying in Rome in autumn 1711, probably under Antonio Montanari or Giuseppe Valentini and perhaps for a short time under Arcangelo Corelli, who died in January 1713. In a letter of 17 March 1714 Locatelli wrote to his father in Bergamo that he was a confirmed member of the &quot;compita accademia di vari instrumenti&quot;, the household musicians of Prince Michelangelo I Caetani (1685–1759), where Valentini had worked as a violinist and composer since no later than 1710. Between 1716 and 1722, Locatelli was also a member of the &quot;congregazione generale dei musici di S. Cecilia&quot;, and thus under the protection of the noble prelate and future Cardinal Camillo Cybo. He also assisted other Roman noble houses, often including that of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in the church of San Lorenzo e San Damaso, probably until 7 February 1723. While in Rome, Locatelli debuted as a composer. In 1721 his &quot;XII Concerti grossi&quot;, Op. 1, dedicated to Camillo Cybo, was published in Amsterdam.

===Travels through Italy and Germany===
From 1723 to 1728 Locatelli travelled through Italy and Germany. Mantua, Venice, Munich, Dresden, Berlin, Frankfurt and Kassel are the only places he is known to have visited. Most of his concert compositions, including the violin concertos and the &quot;capricci&quot;, were probably written in this period. They were published later in Amsterdam. It is believed that his performances made him famous, but almost no source attests to his attaining high virtuosity.

Locatelli&#x27;s activity at the court of the regent of Mantua, the landgrave Philipp von Hessen-Darmstadt, is attested by a 1725 document in which the landgrave refers to him as &quot;our virtuoso&quot;. How often and in what capacity Locatelli performed at that court is not known. Also unknown is the time of his activity in Venice, although he certainly went there.

One notice describes Locatelli&#x27;s visit to Munich. On 26 June 1727, the &quot;foreign virtuoso Locatelli&quot; was paid twelve double golden guilder by the elector&#x27;s director of music.

Just one year later, in May 1728, Locatelli visited the Prussian court in Berlin. He moved from Dresden to Potsdam with Augustus II and the elector&#x27;s escort of about 500 people, including Johann Georg Pisendel, Johann Joachim Quantz and Silvius Leopold Weiss. A notice about Locatelli&#x27;s performance before Frederick William I anecdotally describes the musician&#x27;s self-assurance and his vanity in wearing gorgeous, diamond-studded clothes. The Dutch musicologist Albert Dunning speculated that the aristocratic listeners may have preferred Johann Gottlieb Graun&#x27;s violin playing to Locatelli&#x27;s.

According to an entry in a rich autograph collector&#x27;s records, Locatelli was living in Frankfurt on 20 October 1728. The entry includes a miniature version of the Andante from &quot;Sonata III&quot;, Op. 2, for piano.

Locatelli&#x27;s last known stop was in Kassel, where he received the very high payment of 80 reichsthaler after his visit to Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, on 7 December 1728. The organist Jacob Wilhelm Lustig stated in 1728 that Locatelli had astonished his listeners with hugely difficult passages while scraping at his violin.

===Amsterdam===
In 1729 Locatelli moved to Amsterdam, where he stayed until his death. He did not compose so much as previously, but gave violin lessons to amateurs and edited his opp. 1–9 and the works of other musicians, such as Giovanni Battista Martini&#x27;s Op. 2. His sparsely documented public and semi-public performances were open only to music lovers, not to professional musicians. An Englishman who heard him in 1741 wrote &quot;he is so afraid of People Learning from him, that He won&#x27;t admit a Professed Musician into his Concert&quot;. Some rich music lovers, who would play as amateurs with Locatelli, helped him to become affluent. In aristocratic circles, he was a recognized, admired and supported virtuoso and composer. In 1741 he set up a business selling violin strings from his home. Including taxes he earned about 1500 guilders in 1742 alone, the highest income of any musician from Amsterdam. It is unknown why from 1744, when he released Op. 8, to 1762, when he released Op. 9, there were no reports of him from lexicographers, listeners or national and international music journalists.

Locatelli died on 30 March 1764 in his house on the Prinsengracht. He was buried in the English Reformed Church on the Begijnhof. In 2024 a small monument made by Fabio Pravisani was erected there in his honour.

===Legacy===
A library with over a thousand documents shows Locatelli&#x27;s interest in literature and science. It includes ornithological, theological, church historical, political, geographical, art historical and mathematical works, and literature on music theory dating back to the 16th century. His &quot;nachlass&quot; includes all important writers from Dante on. Among the large quantity of printed and unbound sheet music, there are the collected works of Corelli. Also available are pictures by Dutch, Italian and French masters. All these things, as well as his instruments and much more, were auctioned in August 1765.

==Music==
When Locatelli went to Amsterdam in 1729, he discovered the centre of European music publishing. He published his Opp. 2–6, 8 and 9 and a new edition of Op. 1 in Amsterdam, and Op. 7 in the neighbouring city of Leiden. He took great care to achieve flawless editions. Locatelli gave the well-arranged works to different publishers, and he edited and sold the less-arranged works.

Not only Op. 1 was composed in his early years, but also Op. 3 and parts of Op. 2 and 4 to 8. Locatelli obtained a privilege which protected Opp. 1–8 (which were also issued in Leiden, in Holland) from unauthorised reprints and prevented the import of reprints. In his application for the privilege, he referred to himself as an &quot;Italian music master living in Amsterdam&quot;. As a consequence of the privilege, Locatelli had to give free copies to the Leiden University library; thus, the first prints have been preserved up to the present. An exception was Op. 9, which was published after the expiry of the legal protection.

Locatelli&#x27;s works can be divided into three categories:
*works for his own performances as a virtuoso;
*representative works for larger ensembles;
*chamber music and small works arranged for small ensembles.

Examples of virtuoso works are the Violin Concertos Op. 3 with their associated &quot;Capricci&quot;, and the Violin Sonata Op. 6 with one &quot;Capriccio&quot;. Both works, and especially Op. 3, were standards for virtuosos and made him famous throughout Europe. The &quot;Capricci&quot; were important study and exercise pieces but were not intended for public performance. It was probably through French violin schools that musicians such as Niccolò Paganini discovered Locatelli&#x27;s music. Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot; Op. 1, Nr. 1 is similar to Locatelli&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot; Nr. 7.

Locatelli&#x27;s virtuosity is reflected in the &quot;Capricci&quot; through the use of high registers, double stopping, chords and arpeggios with wide fingering and overextension of the left hand, harmonics, trills in two-part passages (&quot;Trillo del Diavolo&quot;), double trills, varied bow types and variable bowings.

Locatelli&#x27;s &quot;Concerti&quot; Op. 1, Op. 7 and those from Op. 4 are modelled on Corelli&#x27;s &quot;Twelve concerti grossi&quot;, Op. 6. The &quot;Introduttioni teatrali&quot; Op. 4 follow the format of the Neapolitan opera sinfonia.

The Flute Sonatas, Op. 2, the Trio Sonatas, Op. 5, the Violin Sonatas and the Trio Sonatas, Op. 8 were popular in Amsterdam, favouring the city&#x27;s overall galant image matched with contemporary popular music.

<text>Object permanence is the understanding that whether an object can be sensed has no effect on whether it continues to exist. This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children&#x27;s social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.

Jean Piaget, the Swiss psychologist who first studied object permanence in infants, argued that it is one of an infant&#x27;s most important accomplishments, as, without this concept, objects would have no separate, permanent existence. In Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development, infants develop this understanding by the end of the &quot;sensorimotor stage&quot;, which lasts from birth to about two years of age. Piaget thought that an infant&#x27;s perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects. According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop object permanence.

==Early research==
Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget conducted experiments that collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants&#x27; reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented and then was covered with a blanket or removed from sight. Object permanence is considered to be one of the earliest methods for evaluating working memory. An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because they knew it existed, but did not know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.

Piaget concluded that some infants are too young to understand object permanence. A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They concluded that this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.

==Stages==
In Piaget&#x27;s formulation, there are six stages of object permanence. These are:

# 0–1 months: Reflex schema stage – Babies learn how the body can move and work. Vision is blurred and attention spans remain short through infancy. They are not particularly aware of objects to know they have disappeared from sight. However, babies as young as seven minutes old prefer to look at faces. The three primary achievements of this stage are sucking, visual tracking, and hand closure. 
# 1–4 months: Primary circular reactions – Babies notice objects and start following their movements. They continue to look where an object was, but for only a few moments. They &#x27;discover&#x27; their eyes, arms, hands and feet in the course of acting on objects. This stage is marked by responses to familiar images and sounds (including parent&#x27;s face) and anticipatory responses to familiar events (such as opening the mouth for a spoon). The infant&#x27;s actions become less reflexive and intentionality emerges. 
# 4–8 months: Secondary circular reactions – Babies will reach for an object that is partially hidden, indicating knowledge that the whole object is still there. If an object is completely hidden, however, the baby makes no attempt to retrieve it. The infant learns to coordinate vision and comprehension. Actions are intentional, but the child tends to repeat similar actions on the same object. Novel behaviors are not yet imitated. 
# 8–12 months: Coordination of secondary circular reactions – This is deemed the most important for the cognitive development of the child. At this stage the child understands causality and is goal-directed. The very earliest understanding of object permanence emerges, as the child is now able to retrieve an object when its concealment is observed. This stage is associated with the classic A-not-B error. After successfully retrieving a hidden object at one location (A), the child fails to retrieve it at a second location (B). 
# 12–18 months: Tertiary circular reaction – The child gains means-end knowledge and is able to solve new problems. The child is now able to retrieve an object when it is hidden several times within their view, but cannot locate it when it is outside their perceptual field.
# 18–24 months: Invention of new means through mental combination – The child fully understands object permanence. They will not fall for A-not-B errors. Also, a baby is able to understand the concept of items that are hidden in containers. If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will look under the pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox. The child is able to develop a mental image, hold it in mind, and manipulate it to solve problems, including object permanence problems that are not based solely on perception. The child can now reason about where the object may be when invisible displacement occurs.

==Contradicting evidence==
In more recent years, the original Piagetian object permanence account has been challenged by a series of infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget&#x27;s coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants are not supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.

The first study showed infants a toy car that moved down an inclined track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged at the other end, still on the track. The researchers created a &quot;possible event&quot; where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an &quot;impossible event&quot;. In this situation, the toy mouse was placed on the tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. The infants were surprised by the impossible event, which suggests they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants&#x27; response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.

There are primarily four challenges to Piaget&#x27;s framework:

# Whether or not infants without disabilities actually demonstrate object permanence earlier than Piaget claimed. 
# There is disagreement about the relative levels of difficulty posed by the use of various types of covers and by different object positions. 
# Controversy concerns whether or not perception of object permanence can be achieved or measured without the motor acts that Piaget regarded as essential. 
# The nature of inferences that can be made from the A-not-B error has been challenged. Studies that have contributed to this discussion have examined the contribution of memory limitations, difficulty with spatial localization, and difficulty in inhibiting the motor act of reaching to location A on the A-not-B error.

One criticism of Piaget&#x27;s theory is that culture and education exert stronger influences on a child&#x27;s development than Piaget maintained. These factors depend on how much practice their culture provides in developmental processes, such as conversational skills.

==In animals==
Experiments in non-human primates suggest that monkeys can track the displacement of invisible targets, that invisible displacement is represented in the prefrontal cortex, and that development of the frontal cortex is linked to the acquisition of object permanence. Various evidence from human infants is consistent with this. For example, formation of synapses in the frontal cortex peaks during human infancy, and recent experiments using near infrared spectroscopy to gather neuroimaging data from infants suggests that activity in the frontal cortex is associated with successful completion of object permanence tasks.

However, many other types of animals have been shown to have the ability for object permanence. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats did not seem to be quite as good at this &quot;invisible displacement test&quot; as dogs are, it is hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they have been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows&#x27; ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called &quot;A-not-B error&quot;). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.

Among invertebrates, cuttlefish have been showed to possess object permanence.

== In artificial agents ==
It has been shown that artificial intelligent agents can be trained to exhibit object permanence. Building such agents revealed an interesting structure. The object permanence task involves several visual and reasoning components, where the most important ones are to detect a visible object, to learn how it moves and to reason about its movement even when it is not visible. Shamsian et al found that object permanence was achieved when the agent had two separate time-sensitive modules, one that tracks visible objects, and a second that decides &quot;what to track&quot; when one object occludes or contains the target. Object permanence has further been shown to apply to videos &quot;in the wild&quot;.

==Recent studies==
One of the areas of focus on object permanence has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975–76, the result shows that the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.

Some psychologists believe that &quot;while object permanence alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence along with several other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities&quot;. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence is one of the milestones that ties into a child&#x27;s ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.

Other, more recent studies suggest that the idea of object permanence may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget&#x27;s theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object&#x27;s permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.

<doc id="470889" wikidata="Q3795985" url="?curid=470889" title="The Whole Man">
<text>The Whole Man is a 1964 science fiction novel by John Brunner. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1965. In the UK, it was published under the title &quot;Telepathist&quot;.

This novel is often considered a turning point in Brunner&#x27;s career, a step up from the space operas he&#x27;d been turning out as Ace Doubles and pointing towards the richer, more complex books exemplified by &quot;Quicksand&quot; and &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;.

The book is a fix-up novel based on three earlier stories:
* &quot;City of the Tiger&quot; in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, December 1958
* &quot;The Whole Man&quot; in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, April 1959
* &quot;Curative Telepath&quot; in &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;, December 1959

==Plot summary==

After an unspecified crisis in a near-future England where telepathy has been discovered, the authorities discover Gerald Howson, a physically deformed youth with greater telepathic power than has ever been seen before. The novel details Howson&#x27;s struggles to come to grips with his power and his deformity.

<text>Onora Sylvia O&#x27;Neill, Baroness O&#x27;Neill of Bengarve (born 23 August 1941) is a British philosopher and a crossbench member of the House of Lords.

== Early life and education ==
Onora Sylvia O&#x27;Neill was born on 23 August 1941 in Aughafatten. The daughter of Sir Con O&#x27;Neill, she was educated partly in Germany and at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, London, before studying philosophy, psychology and physiology at Somerville College, Oxford. She went on to complete a doctorate at Harvard University, with John Rawls as supervisor. 

== Career ==
During the 1970s, she taught at Barnard College, the women&#x27;s college in Columbia University, New York City. In 1977, she returned to Britain and took up a post at the University of Essex; she was Professor of Philosophy there when she became Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge in 1992.

She is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, a former President of the British Academy (2005–2009) and chaired the Nuffield Foundation (1998–2010). In 2001, she delivered the Gifford Lectures on &quot;Autonomy and Trust in Bioethics&quot; at the University of Edinburgh, and again in 2013 with a series titled &quot;From Toleration to Freedom of Expression&quot;. From 2004 to 2006, she was President of the British Philosophical Association. In 2013, she held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. Until October 2006, she was the Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, and she was chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission until April 2016. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s work has earned her numerous honours and awards, including the million-dollar Berggruen Prize.

==Philosophy==
O&#x27;Neill has written widely on political philosophy and ethics, international justice, bioethics and the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.

Across various works, O&#x27;Neill has defended and applied a constructivist interpretation of Kantian ethics heavily influenced by, and yet critical of, the work of John Rawls, emphasising the importance of trust, consent and respect for autonomy in a just society. She has written extensively about trust, noting &quot;that people often choose to rely on the very people whom they claimed not to trust&quot; and suggesting that we &quot;need to free professionals and the public service to serve the public...to work towards more intelligent forms of accountability...[and] to rethink a media culture in which spreading suspicion has become a routine activity&quot;.

==Honours and distinctions==
O&#x27;Neill has been President of the Aristotelian Society (1988 to 1989), a member of the Animal Procedures Committee (1990 to 1994), chair of Nuffield Council on Bioethics (1996 to 1998), a member and then acting chair of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission (1996 to 1999) and a member of the select committee on BBC Charter Review. She is presently chair of the Nuffield Foundation (since 1997), a trustee of Sense about Science (since 2002), a trustee of the Ditchley Foundation, and a trustee of the Gates Cambridge Trust. She also served as President of the British Academy between 2005 and 2009. She is on the Advisory Board of Incentives for Global Health, the NGO formed to develop the Health Impact Fund proposal.

In 1999, she was created a life peer as Baroness O&#x27;Neill of Bengarve, of The Braid in the County of Antrim, and in 2007 was elected an Honorary FRS. She is also a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993) and the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2002), a Foreign Member of the American Philosophical Society (2003), and Hon. Member Royal Irish Academy (2003), a Foreign Member of the Leopoldina (2004) and the Norwegian Academy of Sciences (2006) and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. She is an elected fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution. In 2007, O&#x27;Neill became a Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2004 she was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Bath. She is a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the School of Advanced Study, University of London, an honour awarded in 2009.

O&#x27;Neill also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007, and from Harvard in 2010.

In October 2012, she was nominated as the next Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and confirmed as such in January 2013.

O&#x27;Neill was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to philosophy and public policy.

In 2014, O&#x27;Neill was elected to the German order Pour le mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste.

In September 2015, during the XII. quinquennial international Kant-conference in Vienna, she received the &quot;Kant-Preis&quot; of the &quot;Fritz Thyssen Stiftung&quot; for her scholarly work on the practical and political philosophy of Immanuel Kant. (see 12th International Kant Congress 2015 » Social Program)

In February 2016, she was awarded the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for her outstanding contribution to moral and ethical questions of trust, accountability in civic life, justice and virtue.

Currently, she is the president of the Society for Applied Philosophy, a society founded in 1982 with the aim of promoting philosophical study and research that has a direct bearing on areas of practical concern.

In 2017, she was awarded the Norwegian Holberg Prize for outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities &quot;for her influential role in ethical and political philosophy&quot;. The same year she was awarded the Berggruen Prize.

O&#x27;Neill is an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College.

In 2021, O&#x27;Neill received an honorary doctorate from the University of Antwerp.

<text>Terra (EOS AM-1) is a multi-national scientific research satellite operated by NASA in a Sun-synchronous orbit around the Earth. It takes simultaneous measurements of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, land, and water to understand how Earth is changing and to identify the consequences for life on Earth. It is the flagship of the Earth Observing System (EOS) and the first satellite of the system which was followed by Aqua (launched in 2002) and Aura (launched in 2004). Terra was launched in 1999.

The name &quot;Terra&quot; comes from the Latin word for Earth. A naming contest was held by NASA among U.S. high school students. The winning essay was submitted by Sasha Jones of Brentwood, Missouri. The identifier &quot;AM-1&quot; refers to its orbit, passing over the equator in the morning.

== Launch ==
The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on December 18th, 1999, aboard an Atlas IIAS vehicle and began collecting data on February 24th, 2000. It was placed into a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of , with a 10:30am descending node.

Terra carries a payload of five remote sensors designed to monitor the state of Earth&#x27;s environment and ongoing changes in its climate system:
*ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) ASTER creates high-resolution images of clouds, ice, water and the land surface using 3 different sensor subsystems. They are the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR); Thermal Infrared (TIR); and Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR). They cover 14 multi-spectral bands from visible to the thermal infrared. The SWIR stopped working in 2008. ASTER was provided by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.
*CERES (Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System)
*MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer)
*MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
*MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere)
Data from the satellite helps scientists better understand the spread of pollution around the globe. Studies have used instruments on Terra to examine trends in global carbon monoxide and aerosol pollution. The data collected by Terra will ultimately become a new, 15-year global data set.

==Operations==
After launch, operators observed that high energy protons like those found over the South Atlantic Anomaly or the poles could induce single-event upsets that would cause the Motor Drive Assembly (MDA) Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) to turn off the MDA. These false shut-downs occur 12–14 times a month and eventually the operations team automated the recovery to reduce the impact of these shut-downs.

Starting in 2007, increased thermal resistance in the SWIR cryocooler of the ASTER instrument caused the temperature to gradually increase. By 2008, despite frequent attempts to recycle the cryocooler the data began to significantly degrade and on January 12, 2009, ASTER managers declared the SWIR no longer functional due to anomalously high SWIR detector temperatures. Data gathered after April 2008 was declared not usable.

On October 13, 2009, Terra suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly likely the result of a Micrometeoroid or Orbital Debris (MMOD) strike.

On February 27, 2020, the Terra flight operations team conducted Terra&#x27;s last inclination adjust maneuver due to the satellite&#x27;s limited remaining fuel. With no more such maneuvers, Terra&#x27;s mean local time has begun to drift starting in April 2021 and with it, its data quality. In October 2022, Terra is expected to reach and exceed a 10:15 AM MLT crossing which is expected to lead operators to initiate a constellation exit to a lower orbit altitude (694 km). Decommissioning would occur around 2025-26 followed by an un-controlled reentry several years later.

== Malicious cyber activities ==
In June and October 2008 the spacecraft was targeted by hackers who gained unauthorized access to its command and control systems, but did not issue any commands.

<text>SSL, formerly Space Systems/Loral, LLC (SS/L), of Palo Alto, California, is a wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary of Maxar Technologies.

SSL designs and builds satellites and space systems for a wide variety of government and commercial customers. Its products include high-powered direct-to-home broadcast satellites, commercial weather satellites, digital audio radio satellites, Earth observation satellites and spot-beam satellites for data networking applications.

==History==
The company was founded as the Western Development Laboratories (WDL) of Philco (Philco-Ford since 1966). The Space Systems Division was made a stand-alone Division of Aeronutronic/Ford Aerospace/ and was acquired by Loral Corp. in 1990 for $715 million from Ford Motor Company, and renamed Space Systems/Loral. All other divisions of Ford Aerospace including Western Development Labs now located in San Jose were also acquired by Loral at that time.

In 2012 Space Systems/Loral was acquired by the Canadian aerospace company MacDonald Dettwiler (now MDA) for $875 million. MDA was renamed as Maxar Technologies in 2017.

SSL&#x27;s major competitors are Boeing Satellite Systems, Lockheed Martin, Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defence and Space and JSC Information Satellite Systems.

==Projects==
In 1960, the Courier 1B, built by then Philco, became the world&#x27;s first active repeater satellite.

SSL has recently pioneered research in electric propulsion systems, lithium-ion power systems and the use of advanced composites on commercial satellites, which permit significant increases in the size and power of a satellite&#x27;s payload and extends the satellite&#x27;s on-orbit lifetime. SSL also has developed new service-enhancing technologies such as super power systems for direct-to-user applications and ground-based beam forming, a technology that uses both satellite and terrestrial assets to provide mobile users with increased coverage and capacity capabilities.

, there are 87 SSL-built geosynchronous satellites in orbit.

=== 1300 Series Platform ===
SSL manufactures satellites based on its SSL 1300 series platform (previously LS-1300, FS-1300) in Palo Alto. Satellites in the series include ProtoStar I, ICO G1, SIRIUS FM-6 and SES NEW SKIES NSS-12. there were 80 satellites based on the 1300 series platform on orbit, with 1 more ready for launch and 21 others under construction.

The company designed and built AsiaSat 8, which was launched on 5 August 2014, and AsiaSat 6, which went into orbit on 7 September 2014. The two satellite launches cost AsiaSat $110 million. The satellites were expected to last 15 years, and contain high-powered C-band transponders providing video and broadband services to the Asia-Pacific region.

==== COTS proposal ====
SSL and Constellation Services International have proposed a reusable space tug based on the 1300 platform and a pressure-fed, low-cost Aquarius Launch Vehicle. The tug would be used to bring supplies to the International Space Station as part of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program.

NASA eventually decided to pursue another proposal for this project. SSL, however, continues to provide Battery Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs), Battery Charge Discharge Units (BCDUs), and Sequential Shunt Units (SSUs) for the ISS.

==== LADEE Mission ====
SSL designed and delivered a propulsion system based on their 1300 platform for the NASA LADEE mission. On April 17, 2014, between 9:30 p.m and 10:22 p.m. PDT, after successfully completing its goal to collect lunar dust and study the Moon&#x27;s atmosphere, NASA&#x27;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft successfully completed a planned de-orbit, bringing an end to the mission to study the structure and of the thin lunar atmosphere.

====Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites====
In June 2017, SSL was awarded the contract to design and build the satellite servicing spacecraft vehicle for the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)’s Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program, which is designed to inspect, repair, and augment geosynchronous satellites and plans to include a refueling payload to extend the life of satellites that are low on propellant. SSL joined the Naval Research Laboratory, the Charles Draper Laboratory and Maxar&#x27;s robotics divisions in Brampton, Ontario and Pasadena to develop the servicer. The servicer is designed to refuel commercial satellites, and global satellite operator SES is the first commercial customer to sign up to use the services for a satellite life extension mission.

In January 2019, SSL decided to abandon its participation in the program because of financial difficulties. Continued participation in the program required the company to fund the cost of the development by more than the typical 33%.

==== Psyche ====
The Psyche mission to asteroid 16 Psyche spacecraft&#x27;s solar-electric propulsion chassis will be built by Maxar.

<text>The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a Japanese remote sensing instrument onboard the Terra satellite launched by NASA in 1999. It has been collecting data since February 2000.

ASTER provides high-resolution images of Earth in 14 different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to thermal infrared light. The resolution of images ranges between 15 and 90 meters. ASTER data is used to create detailed maps of surface temperature of land, emissivity, reflectance, and elevation.

In April 2008, the SWIR detectors of ASTER began malfunctioning and were publicly declared non-operational by NASA in January 2009. All SWIR data collected after 1 April 2008 has been marked as unusable.

The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) is available at no charge to users worldwide via electronic download.

As of 2 April 2016, the entire catalogue of ASTER image data became publicly available online at no cost. It can be downloaded with a free registered account from either NASA&#x27;s Earth Data Search delivery system or from the USGS Earth Explorer delivery system.

==ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model==
===Version 1===
On 29 June 2009, the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) was released to the public.
A joint operation between NASA and Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the Global Digital Elevation Model is the most complete mapping of the earth ever made, covering 99% of its surface.
The previous most comprehensive map, NASA&#x27;s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, covered approximately 80% of the Earth&#x27;s surface, with a global resolution of 90 meters, and a resolution of 30 meters over the US.
The GDEM covers the planet from 83 degrees North to 83 degrees South (surpassing SRTM&#x27;s coverage of 56 °S to 60 °N), becoming the first earth mapping system that provides comprehensive coverage of the polar regions. It was created by compiling 1.3 million VNIR images taken by ASTER using single-pass stereoscopic correlation techniques, with terrain elevation measurements taken globally at 30-meter (98 ft) intervals.

Despite the high nominal resolution, however, some reviewers have commented that the true resolution is considerably lower, and not as good as that of SRTM data, and serious artifacts are present.

Some of these limitations have been confirmed by METI and NASA, who point out that the version 1 of the GDEM product is &quot;research grade&quot;.

===Version 2===
During October 2011, version 2 of Global Digital Elevation Model was publicly released. This is considered an improvement upon version 1. These improvements include increased horizontal and vertical accuracy, better horizontal resolution, reduced presence of artifacts, and more realistic values over water bodies. However, one reviewer still regards the Aster version 2 dataset, although showing &#x27;a considerable improvement in the effective level of detail&#x27;, to still be regarded as &#x27;experimental or research grade&#x27; due to presence of artefacts.
A 2014 study showed that over rugged mountainous terrain the ASTER version 2 data set can be a more accurate representation of the ground than the SRTM elevation model.

===Version 3===
ASTER v3 was released on 5 August 2019.

The improved GDEM V3 adds additional stereo-pairs, improving coverage and reducing the occurrence of artifacts. The refined production algorithm provides improved spatial resolution, increased horizontal and vertical accuracy. The ASTER GDEM V3 maintains the GeoTIFF format and the same gridding and tile structure as V1 and V2, with 30-meter postings and 1 x 1 degree tiles. Version 3 is claimed to have significant improvements over the previous release. Automated processing of 2.3 million scenes from the ASTER archive was used to create the ASTER GDEM, which included stereo-correlation to create individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, masking to remove cloudy pixels, stacking all cloud-screened DEMs, removing residual bad values and outliers, averaging selected data to create final pixel values.

In a poor state of repair the large two-storey brick house was built following a fire in 1797 by the Duke of St Albans. What remained of it was later bought with a few acres of attached lawns and fields by the first Viscount however quickly converted into the London Air Park. The Viscount also transferred his Hanworth Park estate to public benefit in the suburb of Hanworth, London. Its later shape is now a mixture of public grassland and recreational amenities such as sports pitches funded by two local charitable clubs and a leisure centre, built by the London borough.

<text>Baron Margadale, of Islay in the County of Argyll, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 1 January 1965 for the Conservative politician John Morrison. , the title is held by his grandson, the third baron, who succeeded his father in 2003. 

The barony of Margadale is the most recent extant non-royal hereditary barony. Lord Margadale is the most junior of Britain&#x27;s hereditary peers. The barony is named after the area of Margadale, in Islay.

James Morrison, great-grandfather of the first Baron, was a Hampshire innkeeper&#x27;s son who became the greatest textile wholesaler in England and a prominent merchant banker. He left circa £4 million in 1857, the second largest non-landed fortune in Britain up to that time after Nathan Mayer Rothschild&#x27;s £5 million. James&#x27;s son Charles Morrison continued in the same lines of business, and left £10.9 million in 1909, which was the largest British estate for probate purposes up to that time. He was probably the second richest man in Britain at his death, after the Duke of Westminster. Charles Morrison&#x27;s nephew Hugh Morrison was the father of the first Baron Margadale. James Morrison, uncle of the first Baron, was a politician. Sir Charles Morrison and Sir Peter Morrison, younger sons of the first Baron, were both Conservative politicians.

The family seat is Fonthill House, near Fonthill Bishop, Wiltshire.

<doc id="470943" wikidata="Q779517" url="?curid=470943" title="The Triplets of Belleville">
<text>The Triplets of Belleville () is a 2003 animated adventure comedy-drama film written and directed by Sylvain Chomet. It was released as Belleville Rendez-vous in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The film is Chomet&#x27;s first feature film and was an international co-production among companies in France, Belgium, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The film features the voices of Lina Boudreault, Mari-Lou Gauthier, Michèle Caucheteux, Jean-Claude Donda, Michel Robin, and Monica Viegas. There is little dialogue; much of the narrative is conveyed through song and pantomime. It tells the story of Madame Souza, an elderly woman who goes on a quest to rescue her grandson Champion, a Tour de France cyclist, who has been kidnapped by the French mafia for gambling purposes and taken to the city of Belleville (an amalgamation of Paris, New York City, Montreal and Quebec City). She is accompanied by Champion&#x27;s loyal and obese hound, Bruno, and joined by the Triplets of Belleville, music hall singers from the 1930s, whom she meets in the city.

The film was highly praised by audiences and critics for its unique style of animation and has since gained a cult following. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for &quot;Belleville Rendez-vous&quot;. It was also screened out of competition (&quot;hors concours&quot;) at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
In France, Madame Souza is raising her grandson Champion, a melancholy orphan. They watch an old variety show on television featuring a trio of singers, the Triplets of Belleville (Rose, Blanche, and Violette). When the program is interrupted, Souza asks Champion if the &quot;film&quot; is finished. The listless Champion does not reply and instead changes the channel to a piano concert. Souza, seeing Champion&#x27;s interest in the music, pulls out an old piano and tries to amuse him, but Champion remains indifferent. She deduces that Champion is lonely and buys him a dog, Bruno. Neither Bruno nor an electric train set succeed in lifting Champion&#x27;s spirits, and the dog has no interests apart from eating, sleeping, and barking at trains.

While tidying Champion&#x27;s room, Souza discovers a book filled with photos of cyclists. She buys Champion a tricycle, and he becomes an obsessive cyclist. Some years later he is competing in the Tour de France, when he is kidnapped by a pair of mobsters in a Citroën van. They take him and two other contestants across the Atlantic, Souza pursuing them on a pedalo.

Arriving in the United States penniless and hungry, Souza and the obese Bruno are adopted by the Triplets of Belleville, now elderly, and taken to their seedy apartment. When dinner is finally served, it consists of frog soup and frog stew, with tadpoles for dessert, collected by Violette using &quot;expanding bait&quot;. Souza joins their band, playing bicycle spokes like a dulcimer, to their refrigerator-shelf harp, newspaper percussion and vacuum-cleaner bagpipe. During the show, Souza spots the kidnappers. With the help of the Triplets, Souza rescues the cyclists, who had been forced to pedal-power a gambling machine, and escape on the pedaling frame, pursued by the mobsters in Citroën sedans.

In a flashforward, an older Champion watches the TV again showing their adventure when they are leaving the city and remembers Souza asking once more if the film is finished. Champion turns to the empty bench next to him and says &quot;It&#x27;s over, Grandma&quot;.

In a humorous post-credits scene, the boatman who rented Souza the pedalo is seen patiently waiting for his vessel to return.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that of surveyed critics gave it a positive review, and the average rating was ; the consensus reads: &quot;Richly detailed and loaded with surreal touches, &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot; is an odd, delightful charmer.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, rated it 91/100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Animated Feature, making it the first PG-13 animated film to be nominated in that category; and for Best Original Song (Benoît Charest and Sylvain Chomet for the song &quot;Belleville Rendez-vous&quot;, sung by Matthieu Chedid in the original version).

<text>The Henry Hudson Bridge is a double-deck steel arch toll bridge in New York City across the Spuyten Duyvil Creek. It connects Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx with Inwood in Manhattan to the south, via the Henry Hudson Parkway (NY 9A). On the Manhattan side, the parkway goes into Inwood Hill Park. Commercial vehicles are not permitted on this bridge or on the parkway in general.

The bridge is operated by MTA Bridges and Tunnels, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

==Design==


The bridge was designed by David B. Steinman, drawing upon his 1911 Ph.D. thesis in civil engineering at Columbia University. Named to commemorate the voyage of Henry Hudson on the &quot;Half Moon&quot;, which anchored near the site in 1609, it was the longest plate girder arch and fixed arch bridge in the world when it opened in 1936.

The bridge has two roadway levels carrying a total of six traffic lanes and a pedestrian walkway and spans Spuyten Duyvil Creek just east of where the tidal strait meets the Hudson River. The bridge is part of the Henry Hudson Parkway, New York State Route 9A. To its west, at five feet above water level, is the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, which is used by Amtrak trains to Albany, New York and other points north. The Spuyten Duyvil Metro-North station is under the Henry Hudson Bridge on the Bronx side.

==History==

A bridge at this location was proposed as early as 1906, but Spuyten Duyvil residents and other civic groups opposed the bridge, arguing that it would destroy the virgin forest of Inwood Hill Park and bring traffic congestion to Bronx communities. Robert Moses preferred the route along the Hudson River because he received the land for the Henry Hudson Parkway for free and used federal labor to build the parkway.

The original single-deck structure was built for the Henry Hudson Parkway Authority by the American Bridge Company at a cost of $4.949 million and opened on December 12, 1936. The upper level of the bridge was designed to be added at a later date and opened on May 7, 1938. The second deck cost $2 million and was funded by toll revenue. The bridge&#x27;s construction helped open the Riverdale neighborhood to development.

A rehabilitation project commenced in 2000 and was carried out by Steinman, Boynton, Gronquist and Birdsall, a successor of David B. Steinman&#x27;s firm. Repairs took place nearly continuously for at least a decade, at a cost of $160 million. The bridge was renovated from late 2017 to late 2020. The $86 million project replaced the last remnants of the original upper and lower decks, reopened the pedestrian and cycling path, eliminated the lower-level toll booth, upgraded roadway lighting, and made seismic improvements.

==Tolls==
, drivers pay $8.25 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $3.18 per car or $2.17 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $5.04 per car or $3.46 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates. Starting in February 2024, all drivers who have a Bronx address and a NYCSC E-ZPass have received a 100 percent rebate; Bronx residents are automatically enrolled in the program.

The original toll was 10 cents. In January 2010, the MTA announced that it planned to implement a pilot program on the Henry Hudson Bridge to phase out toll booths and use open road tolling. On January 20, 2011, this toll pilot project got underway. Drivers without E-ZPass are sent a bill in the mail. The new tolling system was implemented on November 10, 2012, and has since been implemented on all nine MTA crossings.

On November 20, 2016, the tollbooths were dismantled, as drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were located. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

<doc id="470955" wikidata="Q185488" url="?curid=470955" title="Volga Bulgaria">
<text>Volga Bulgaria or Volga–Kama Bulgaria (sometimes referred to as the Volga Bulgar Emirate) was a historical Bulgar state that existed between the 9th and 13th centuries around the confluence of the Volga and Kama River, in what is now European Russia. Volga Bulgaria was a multi-ethnic state with large numbers of Bulgars, Finno-Ugrians, Varangians, and East Slavs. Its strategic position allowed it to create a local trade monopoly with Norse, Cumans, and Pannonian Avars.

==History==

===Origin and creation of the state===
The origin of the early Bulgars is still unclear. Their homeland is believed to be situated between Kazakhstan and the North Caucasian steppes. Interaction with the Hunnic tribes, causing the migration, may have occurred there, and the Pontic–Caspian steppe seems the most likely location.

Some scholars propose that the Bulgars may have been a branch or offshoot of the Huns or at least Huns seem to have been absorbed by the Bulgars after Dengizich&#x27;s death. Others however, argue that the Huns continued under Ernak, becoming the Kutrigur and Utigur Hunno-Bulgars. These conclusions remain a topic of ongoing debate and controversy among scholars.

The Bulgars were an Oghuric people who settled north of the Black Sea. During their westward migration across the Eurasian steppe, they came under the overlordship of Khazars, leading other ethnic groups, including Finno-Ugric and Iranic as well as other Turkic peoples. In about 630 they founded Old Great Bulgaria, which was destroyed by the Khazars in 668. Kotrag, following the death of his father, began to extend the influence of his Bulgars to the Volga River. He is remembered as the founder of Volga Bulgaria. They reached Idel-Ural in the eighth century, where they became the dominant population at the end of the 9th century, uniting other tribes of different origin who lived in the area.

However, some Bulgar tribes under the leader Asparukh moved west from the Pontic-Caspian steppes and eventually settled along the Danube River., in what is now known as Bulgaria proper, where they created a confederation with the Slavs, adopting a South Slavic language and the Eastern Orthodox faith. However, Bulgars in Idel-Ural eventually gave birth to Chuvash people. Unlike Danube Bulgars, Volga Bulgars did not adopt any language. The Chuvash language today is the only Oghuric language that survived and it is the sole living representative of the Volga Bulgar language.

Most scholars agree that the Volga Bulgars were initially subject to the Khazar Khaganate. This fragmented Volga Bulgaria grew in size and power and gradually freed itself from the influence of the Khazars. Sometime in the late 9th century, unification processes started and the capital was established at Bolghar (also spelled Bulgar) city, 160 km south of modern Kazan. However, complete independence was reached after Khazaria&#x27;s destruction and conquest by Sviatoslav in the late 10th century; thus, Bulgars no longer paid tribute to it. Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur named the Volga Bulgar people as &quot;Ulak&quot;.

===Conversion to Islam and further statehood===
Volga Bulgaria adopted Islam as a state religion in 922 – 66 years before the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;. In 921 Almış sent an ambassador to the Caliph requesting religious instruction. The next year an embassy returned with Ibn Fadlan as secretary. A significant number of Muslims already lived in the country. The Volga Bulgars attempted to convert Vladimir I of Kiev to Islam; however Vladimir rejected the notion of Rus&#x27; giving up wine, which he declared was the &quot;very joy of their lives&quot;.

Commanding the Volga River in its middle course, the state controlled much of trade between Europe and Asia prior to the Crusades (which made other trade routes practicable). Bolghar, was a thriving city, rivalling in size and wealth the greatest centres of the Islamic world. Trade partners of Bolghar included from Vikings, Bjarmland, Yugra and Nenets in the north to Baghdad and Constantinople in the south, from Western Europe to China in the East. Other major cities included Bilär, Suar (Suwar), Qaşan (Kashan) and Cükätaw (Juketau). Modern cities Kazan and Yelabuga were founded as Volga Bulgaria&#x27;s border fortresses. Some of the Volga Bulgarian cities have still not been found, but they are mentioned in old East Slavic sources. They are: Ashli (Oshel), Tuxçin (Tukhchin), İbrahim (Bryakhimov), Taw İle. Some of them were ruined during and after the Golden Horde invasion.

Volga Bulgaria played a key role in the trade between Europe and the Muslim world. Furs and slaves were the main goods in this trade, and the Volga Bulgarian slave trade played a significant role. People taken captive during the viking raids in Western Europe, such as Ireland, could be sold to Moorish Spain via the Dublin slave trade or transported to Hedeby or Brännö in Scandinavia and from there via the Volga trade route to Russia, where slaves and furs were sold to Muslim merchants in exchange for Arab silver &quot;dirham&quot; and silk, which have been found in Birka, Wollin and Dublin; initially this trade route between Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate passed via the Khazar Kaghanate, but from the early 10th century onward it went via Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm, to the Samanid slave market in Central Asia and finally via Iran to the Abbasid Caliphate. Slavic pagans were also enslaved by Vikings, Magyars, and Volga Bulgars, who transported them to Volga Bulgaria, where they were sold to Muslim slave traders and continued to Khwarezm and the Samanids, with a minor part being exported to the Byzantine Empire. This was a major trade; the Samanids were the main source of Arab silver to Europe via this route, and Ibn Fadlan referred to the ruler of the Volga Bulgar as &quot;King of the Saqaliba&quot; because of his importance for this trade.

The Rus&#x27; principalities to the west posed the only tangible military threat. In the 11th century, the country was devastated by several raids by other Rus&#x27;. Then, at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, the rulers of Vladimir (notably Andrew the Pious and Vsevolod III), anxious to defend their eastern border, systematically pillaged Volga Bulgarian cities. Under Rus&#x27; pressure from the west, the Volga Bulgars had to move their capital from Bolghar to Bilär.

===Decline===
From the beginning of the 13th century, the Volga Bulgars were subject to multiple raids from the East Slavic principalities as multiple skirmishes took place for control of the Unzha River which was an important commercial route. In 1220, the Grand Duke Yuri II of Vladimir captured Ustiug and besieged the important Bulgar town of Aşlı. The consequence of this was that Vladimir-Suzdal gained access to Volga Bulgaria&#x27;s northern trade routes and hindered the means of the Bulgars acquiring fur. The Nikon Chronicle also details that following this, Yuri II began amassing a large force of Rus&#x27; for an even larger campaign against the Bulgars. The Bulgars would send entreaties and proposals for peace but these were all rejected. Yuri travelled with his army to Omut where further entreaties for peace were received from the Bulgars however these were still rejected. However, by the time Vasilko Konstantinovich of Rostov arrived, Yuri accepted an offer of gifts and agreed to adhere to an earlier peace treaty with the Bulgars that was agreed under the rule of his father, Vsevolod the Big Nest.

In September 1223 near Samara an advance guard of Genghis Khan&#x27;s army under the command of Uran, son of Subutai Bahadur, entered Volga Bulgaria but was defeated in the Battle of Samara Bend. In 1236, the Mongols returned and in five years had subjugated the whole country, which at that time was suffering from internal war . Henceforth Volga Bulgaria became a part of the Ulus Jochi, later known as the Golden Horde. It was divided into several principalities; each of them became a vassal of the Golden Horde and received some autonomy. By the 1430s, the Khanate of Kazan was established as the most important of these principalities.

Volga Bulgar language was a Turkic language. The only extant member of the Oghuric group that is still spoken today is the Chuvash language. The language persisted in the Volga region up until the 13th or 14th century. Although there is no direct evidence, some scholars believe it gave rise to modern Chuvash language while others support the idea that Chuvash is another distinct Oghur Turkic language.

Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.

Definition of verbs in Volga Bulgar

Volga Bulgars left some inscriptions in tombstones. There are few surviving inscriptions in the Volga Bulgar language, as the language was primarily an oral language and the Volga Bulgars did not develop a writing system until much later in their history. After converting to Islam, some of these inscriptions were written using Arabic letters while the use of the Orkhon script continued. Mahmud al-Kashgari provides some information about the language of the Volga Bulgars, whom he refers to as Bulghars. Some scholars suggest Hunnic had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and classify this grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.

Numbers and Vocabulary in Volga Bulgar

Mahmud al-Kashgari also provides some examples of Volga Bulgar words, poems, and phrases in his dictionary.. However, Mahmud al-Kashgari himself wasn&#x27;t a native speaker of Volga Bulgar. Despite its limitations, Mahmud al-Kashgari&#x27;s work remains an important source of information about the Volga Bulgar language and its place within the broader Turkic language family.

Cases in Volga Bulgar
==Coats of arms of Volga Bulgaria during Tsarist Russia==
Ivan III was also called the &quot;Prince of Bulgaria&quot;. The mention of the Bulgarian land has been present in the royal title since 1490. This refers to Volga Bulgaria.Ivan by the grace of God is the sovereign of all Russia and the Grand Duke of Vladimir, and Moscow, and Novgorod, and Pskov, and Tver, and Yugra, and Prmsk, and Bolgar and othersIt is known that the Bulgarian coat of arms figure was used to designate the Bulgarian Kingdom and in the Great Seal of Tsar John IV. The seal was a &quot;lion walking&quot; (which is confirmed by the seals of the Volga Bulgarians found by archaeologists). On the coats of arms and seals of the Russian tsars, the lands of Volga Bulgaria were represented on a green field by a silver walking lamb with a red banner divided by a silver cross; the shaft is gold. The erroneous perception of the beast on the Bulgarian coat of Arms in the Royal Titular as a lamb is explained by the poor quality of the reproduction of the image.

In the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Russian Sovereigns ...&quot; by I. Nekhachin (ed. by A.Reshetnikov, 1793), the Bulgarian coat of arms is described as follows: &quot;Bulgarian, in a blue field, a silver lamb wearing a red banner.&quot; Over time, the colour of the shield changed to green. In the Manifesto on the full coat of arms of the Empire (1800), the Bulgarian coat of arms is described as follows: &quot;In a green field it has a white Lamb with a golden radiance near its head; in its right front paw it holds a Christian banner.&quot; The description of the coat of arms, approved in 1857: &quot;The Bulgarian coat of arms: a silver lamb walking in a green field, with a scarlet banner, on which the cross is also silver; the shaft is gold.&quot;

==Demographics==
A large part of the region&#x27;s population included Turkic groups such as Sabirs, Esegel, Barsil, Bilars, Baranjars, and part of the obscure Burtas (by ibn Rustah). Modern Chuvash claim to descend from Sabirs, Esegels, and Volga Bulgars.

Another part comprised Volga Finnic and Magyar (Asagel and Pascatir) tribes, from which Bisermäns probably descend. Ibn Fadlan refers to Volga Bulgaria as Saqaliba, a general Arabic term for Slavic people. Other researches tie the term to the ethnic name Scythian (or Saka in Persian).

Over time, the cities of Volga Bulgaria were rebuilt and became trade and craft centres of the Golden Horde. Some Volga Bulgars, primarily masters and craftsmen, were forcibly moved to Sarai and other southern cities of the Golden Horde. Volga Bulgaria remained a centre of agriculture and handicraft.

<text>The Lions Gate Bridge, opened in 1938 and officially known as the First Narrows Bridge, is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet and connects the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the North Shore municipalities of the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. The term &quot;Lions Gate&quot; refers to the Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction. A pair of cast concrete lions, designed by sculptor Charles Marega, were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January 1939.

The total length of the bridge including the north viaduct is . The length including approach spans is , the main span alone is , the tower height is , and it has a ship&#x27;s clearance of . Prospect Point in Stanley Park offered a good high south end to the bridge, but the low flat delta land to the north required construction of the extensive North Viaduct.

The bridge has three lanes, with the middle being a reversible lane indicated by signals. The centre lane changes direction to accommodate for traffic patterns. The traffic volume on the bridge is 60,000–70,000 vehicles per day. Trucks exceeding are prohibited, as are vehicles using studded tires. The bridge forms part of Highways 99 and 1A.

On March 24, 2005, the Lions Gate Bridge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

==History==
In 1890, land speculator George Grant Mackay wrote in the local paper that he foresaw a bridge over the first narrows. The First Narrows ferry operated between Ambleside and Gastown from 1909 to 1947. The decision on whether to build the bridge was put to the electorate of Vancouver in 1927, but the first plebiscite was defeated and the idea was put to rest for the time being.

Alfred James Towle Taylor, an engineer with a land interest in the construction of the bridge, worked to overcome local opposition to its construction. Taylor was able to convince Walter Guinness of the Guinness family (of the Irish stout fame) to invest in the land on the north shore of Burrard Inlet. They purchased of West Vancouver mountainside through a syndicate called British Pacific Properties Ltd.

On December 13, 1933, a second plebiscite was held, passing with 70 percent in favour. After considerable further negotiations with the federal government, approval was finally granted, with the requirement that Vancouver materials and workmen be used as much as possible to provide employment during the Great Depression. The 1933 bylaw authorizing construction included a provision mandating that &quot;no Asiatic person shall be employed in or upon any part of the undertaking or other works&quot;.

The bridge was designed by the Montreal firm Monsarrat and Pratley, which was later responsible for the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax, Nova Scotia, using a similar design. Other companies involved in the construction of the bridge included Swan Wooster Engineering, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp; Douglas, Rowan Williams Davies &amp; Irwin Inc., Canron Western Constructors, Dominion Bridge Company, American Bridge Company.

Construction began on March 31, 1937. After one and a half years and a cost of , the bridge opened to traffic on November 14, 1938. On May 29, 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the official opening during a royal visit to Canada. A toll of 25 cents was charged for each car or horse and carriage; five cents was charged for pedestrians or bicycles.

The bridge was built with two lanes, but a third reversible lane was added on May 19, 1952, to add capacity during peak periods in the peak direction. The system cost $18,000 and was controlled with signs to indicate when the reversible centre lane was opened to traffic. 

On January 20, 1955, the Guinness family sold the bridge to the province of British Columbia for $5,873,837the cost of the original construction. The government also considered plans to build a parallel span, which was estimated to cost $17 million in 1954, but these were shelved in favour of moving forward with the construction of the Second Narrows Bridge farther east up the Burrard Inlet and improving the existing Lions Gate Bridge.

A partial cloverleaf interchange was built in 1956 at Marine Way, located at the end of the bridge&#x27;s north approach, and was followed by a new bridge over the Capilano River to address congestion issues. 

The toll instituted by the Guinness family remained on the Lions Gate Bridge until April 1, 1963, as part of the provincial government&#x27;s toll removal scheme for several bridges. The toll plaza at the north end of the bridge was later demolished. 

In 1965, the centre lane controls were replaced with traffic signals.

In 1975, the deteriorating original concrete deck of the North Viaduct was replaced with a lighter, wider, and stronger steel orthotropic deck with wider lanes. This was carried out in sections using a series of short closures of the bridge; each time, one old section was lowered from the bridge and its replacement was put into place.

In 1986, the Guinness family, as a gift to Vancouver, purchased decorative lights that make it a distinctive nighttime landmark. The 170 lights were designed and installed by British engineer Ian Hayward and first lit up on February 19 of that year. 

In 1994, a new counterflow system was introduced to the bridge to reduce congestion.
From September 2000 to September 2001, the replacement of the entire suspended structure of the original suspension bridge was undertaken without interruption of peak-hour trafficthe first time an entire suspended structure of a major suspension bridge was replaced while in daily use. As with the 1975 replacement work, this was facilitated by a series of separate nighttime and weekend closures to replace one section at a time. The old suspended section was lowered to a barge, and the new lighter and wider orthotropic deck section raised into place and connected. A total of 47 sections were used before being paved. The new deck was designed with the two pedestrian walkways cantilevered to the outside of the suspension cables and the three road lanes widened from each. As a result of the 2001 replacement, the 63-year-old suspension bridge, which was described as &quot;not designed for durability&quot;, had its lifespan extended.

In July 2009, the bridge&#x27;s lighting system was updated with new LED lights to replace its system of 100-watt mercury vapour bulbs. The switch to LEDs was expected to reduce power consumption on the bridge by 90 percent and save the provincial government about $30,000 a year in energy and maintenance costs.

In 2020, a project to decrease the likelihood of a boat accident was completed.

In May 2022, a project to replace the lane control signals with new LED ones was completed.

In late 2023, the northern approach was repaved.

<doc id="470960" wikidata="Q2487804" url="?curid=470960" title="Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge">
<text>The Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge (originally and often referred to as the Marine Parkway Bridge) is a vertical-lift bridge in New York City, New York, that crosses Rockaway Inlet. The bridge, which opened on July 3, 1937, connects the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, with Flatbush Avenue to Floyd Bennett Field, Belt Parkway, and the Marine Park neighborhood in Brooklyn. The bridge is designated as New York State Route 901B, an unsigned reference route.

The center span is long and is normally above the water but can be lifted to a height of above water level. With its distinctive twin towers (which house the vertical-lift machinery), the bridge has become an iconic landmark and symbol of the Rockaways.

The bridge is owned by the City of New York and operated by the MTA Bridges and Tunnels, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The operation of this bridge includes the maintenance of the Marine Parkway from the toll plaza to Jacob Riis Park. Though a city-owned and operated bridge, it connects Floyd Bennett Field and Jacob Riis Park, which are both part of the National Park System&#x27;s Gateway National Recreation Area.

==History==
=== Construction and opening ===
In February 1934, the New York State Assembly introduced a bill to build a $10 million bridge connecting Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses wanted the bridge to connect Marine Park in Brooklyn and Jacob Riis Park in Queens, two of the parks that he was developing. The assembly authorized the creation of the Marine Parkway Authority, which was tasked with developing the bridge, in March. Moses was named as the only member of the authority. The next month, New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman approved the Assembly bill.

The Marine Parkway Bridge was to be constructed using Public Works Administration funds. The United States Department of War approved the Marine Parkway Authority&#x27;s request to construct a bridge over Rockaway Inlet in December 1935, although some members of the War Department preferred a tunnel under the inlet so as to not impede marine traffic. In order to fund the bridge&#x27;s construction the Marine Parkway Authority authorized the issuance of $6 million worth of bonds that would mature in 25 years. The bridge would also collect tolls from drivers to fund part of the rest of the costs. The Marine Parkway Bridge was developed in conjunction with other road infrastructure projects in New York City, such as the Triborough Bridge, Henry Hudson Parkway, Belt Parkway, and Grand Central Parkway. It would also be a part of a new greenbelt of parks that included Jacob Riis Park.

The bridge was to be built near Barren Island, an island on the Brooklyn side that housed 90 people from the former Barren Island community. In April 1936. The community was evicted so that the Marine Parkway Authority could place of landfill to build a landing for the bridge, The Marine Parkway Authority opened a bidding competition for the construction of the Marine Parkway Bridge in June 1936. Eight bids had been submitted by the time the bidding process was completed in October 1936. The crossing&#x27;s principal designer was David B. Steinman, with Richard S. M. Lee and Shortridge Hardesty as assistant designers, and Emil Praeger as Chief Engineer. The American Bridge Company ultimately ended up constructing the bridge since it had submitted the lowest bid, at just over $2.1 million.

The Marine Parkway Bridge was supposed to be completed in two years, but the construction process was accelerated because the city wanted the bridge to be completed in time to accommodate ferry traffic in summer 1937. By January 1937, there was significant progress on the Marine Parkway Bridge&#x27;s construction, as the main span had been floated into place on January 13. The last section of the bridge was installed on May 26, 1937, and the toll bridge opened on July 3, 1937. A ceremonial opening had been scheduled for 10:30 AM that day, but the bridge was opened 15 minutes early in order to allow fire trucks to combat a five-alarm fire near the Rockaways&#x27; Playland amusement park in Rockaway Beach. At the time, the span was the longest vertical-lift vehicular span in the world. Green Bus Lines extended its Rockaway route (the current Q35 bus) across the bridge to Flatbush on the day of the bridge&#x27;s opening. The bridge&#x27;s opening spurred a wave of real-estate sales in Flatbush. However, it also increased the amount of vehicular traffic to the Rockaways, which already had a severe traffic congestion problem.

=== Later years ===
The bridge saw 1.7 million vehicles in 1938, its first full year of operation. By 1940, the Marine Parkway Bridge had recorded 4 million crossings. Following the 1940 merger of the Marine Parkway Authority and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the operation of the bridge fell to the latter. On the bridge&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;The Wave of Long Island&quot; noted that 80 million vehicles had crossed the bridge since opening.

On April 4, 1978, the bridge connecting Brooklyn and Queens was renamed for Gil Hodges, the former championship-winning first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers who later won a World Series as the manager of the Queens-based New York Mets. It was believed to be the first bridge to be named for a major sports figure.

From 1999 to 2001, the bridge received a renovation. The four lanes were widened by placing the pedestrian walkway on the outside of the superstructure. The existing steel-grated roadway deck on the lift span was replaced with a new steel grating. A Jersey barrier was also installed to separate opposing traffic flows. In addition, the elevators and electrical systems in the two towers were replaced, and new variable message signs and traffic control devices were installed on the bridge, approach roadways, and toll plaza. The walkway on the bridge was closed temporarily so the roadway could be widened.

Part of the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in 2001 was filmed from a tollbooth camera on this bridge.

== Description ==
The Marine Parkway Bridge carries four motor traffic lanes, bicycle paths on the west side of the bridge, and a footpath on the western edge. Originally, the bridge only had two lanes, or one in each direction. The entirety of the bridge, including approaches, is long. The main part of the Marine Parkway Bridge consists of three spans with an aggregate length of . The center span is 540 feet long, weighs 3,600 tons, and is located above water level in the bridge&#x27;s &quot;closed&quot; position. When the Marine Parkway Bridge is &quot;open&quot;, the center span can be raised to a height of to allow vessels to pass beneath the roadway. The bridge was raised 157 times in 2006. The curled tops of the towers were designed to give the bridge a whimsical aspect.

==Tolls==
, drivers pay $5.60 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $2.60 per car or $2.17 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $4.11 per car or $3.46 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

When the bridge opened, passenger automobiles were charged a toll of 15 cents. When the Cross Bay Bridge was opened in 1939, the toll for passenger cars and motorcycles was lowered to 10 cents to match that of the Cross Bay Bridge. Tolls for all other vehicle classes remained as before. Since 1993, residents of the Rockaways have received discounts on tolls for the Marine Parkway Bridge and Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge. The tollbooths for the Marine Parkway Bridge were configured to collect tolls electronically from E-ZPass transponders in 1996.

Open-road cashless tolling began on April 30, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were located. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly. Residents with leftover bridge tokens will be eligible to redeem their tokens for a refund.

== Incidents ==
One person was killed in a three-car accident on the bridge on June 3, 1951. Another fatal accident on the bridge on July 14, 1963, killed two and injured seven.

On April 10, 1957, a gate for the Marine Parkway Bridge&#x27;s drawbridge span was being lowered when it hit a bus, injuring four passengers.

On November 24, 2014, the bridge experienced a power failure while it was raised to let a boat pass. It remained stuck in the raised position for about six hours before technicians were able to lower it.

<text>The Danish resistance movements () were an underground insurgency to resist the German occupation of Denmark during World War II. Due to the initially lenient arrangements, in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power, the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries.

Members of the Danish resistance movement were involved in underground activities, ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage. Major groups included the communist BOPA (, Civil Partisans) and Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Some small resistance groups such as the Samsing Group and the Churchill Club also contributed to the sabotage effort. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals.

In the postwar period, the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings. Studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries revealed cases of improvised and contingent decision making about the targets, including morally ambiguous choices. Several important books and films have been produced on this topic.

== Nonviolent resistance: 1940–1943 ==

===The &quot;model protectorate&quot;===
During the invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940 and subsequent occupation, the Danish king and government chose not to flee the country and instead collaborated with the German authorities who allowed the Danish government to remain in power. The Germans had reasons to do so, especially as they wanted to showcase Denmark as a &quot;model protectorate&quot;, earning the nickname &quot;the Cream Front&quot; (), due to the relative ease of the occupation and copious amount of dairy products. As the democratically elected Danish government remained in power, Danish citizens had less motivation to fight the occupation than in countries where the Germans established puppet governments, such as Norway or France. The police also remained under Danish authority and led by Danes.

Daily life in Denmark remained much the same as before the occupation. The Germans did make certain changes: imposing official censorship, prohibiting dealings with the Allies, and stationing German troops in the country. The Danish government actively discouraged violent resistance because it feared a severe backlash from the Germans against the civilian population.

===Resistance groups===
Immediately after the occupation began, isolated attempts were made to set up resistance and intelligence activities. Intelligence officers from the Danish army, known as the &quot;Princes,&quot; began channeling reports to London allies as early as April 13, 1940. Soon afterwards, Ebbe Munck, a journalist from &quot;Berlingske Tidende,&quot; arranged to be transferred to Stockholm. From there he could more easily report to and communicate with the British.

Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 the Germans banned the Danish Communist Party and had the Danish police arrest its members. Those members who either avoided arrest or later escaped thus went underground and created resistance cells. From October 1942, they published a clandestine newspaper, &quot;Land og Folk&quot; (&quot;Land and People&quot;), based on the previous Communist Party newspaper, &quot;Arbejderbladet&quot;, which was distributed widely across the country. Circulation grew to 120,000 copies per day by the end of the occupation. At the beginning of 1943, the cells were centrally coordinated under BOPA (&quot;Borgerlige Partisaner&quot; – Civil Partisans), which also began to plan acts of sabotage.

As time went on, many other insurgent groups formed to oppose the occupation. These included the Hvidsten group, which received weapons parachuted by the British, and Holger Danske, which was successful in organizing sabotage activities and the assassinations of collaborators. The Churchill club, one of the first resistance groups in Denmark, was a group of eight schoolboys from Aalborg. They performed some 25 acts of sabotage against the Germans, destroying Nazi German assets with makeshift grenades and stealing Nazi German weapons.

When the Germans forced the Danish government to sign the anti-Comintern pact, a large protest broke out in Copenhagen.

The number of Danish Nazis was low before the war, and this trend continued throughout the occupation. This was confirmed in the 1943 parliamentary elections, in which the population voted overwhelmingly for the four traditional parties, or abstained. The latter option was widely interpreted as votes for the Danish Communist Party. The election was a disappointment for the National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Denmark (DNSAP) and German &quot;Reichsbevollmächtigter&quot;. Dr. Werner Best abandoned plans to create a government under Danish Nazi leader Frits Clausen, due to Clausen&#x27;s lack of public support.

In 1942–43, resistance operations gradually shifted to more violent action, most notably acts of sabotage. Various groups succeeded in making contacts with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) which began making airdrops of agents and supplies. There were not many drops until August 1944, but they increased through the end of the occupation. In total throughout the war, over 600 tons of weapons, equipment and explosives were airdropped to the Danish resistance by the Allies, while fifty-three SOE agents were dispatched to Denmark.

===Military intelligence operations===
On 23 April 1940, members of Danish military intelligence established contacts with their British counterparts through the British diplomatic mission in Stockholm. The first intelligence dispatch was sent by messenger to the Stockholm mission in the autumn of 1940. This evolved into regular dispatches of military and political intelligence, and by 1942–43, the number of dispatches had increased to at least one per week. In addition, an employee of Danmarks Radio was able to transmit short messages to Britain through the national broadcasting network.

The intelligence was gathered mostly by officers in the Danish army and navy; they reported information about political developments, the location and size of German military units, and details about the Danish section of the Atlantic Wall fortifications. In 1942, the Germans demanded the removal of the Danish military from Jutland, but intelligence operations continued. It was carried out by plainclothes personnel or by reserve officers, since this group was not included in the evacuation order. Following the liberation of Denmark, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery described the intelligence gathered in Denmark as &quot;second to none&quot;.

== Violent resistance: 1943–1945 ==

As the years went by, the number of acts of sabotage and violence grew. In 1943, the number grew dramatically, to the point that the German authorities became dissatisfied with the Danish authorities&#x27; handling of the situation. At the end of August, the Germans took over full administration in Denmark, which allowed them to deal with the population as they wished. The Germans raided every police station in Denmark, disarmed, arrested and deported all 2,000 Danish police officers to Germany. Policing became easier for the Nazis, but more and more people became involved with the movement because they were no longer worried about protecting the Danish government.

In particular, the Danish Freedom Council was set up in September 1943, bringing together the various resistance groups in order to improve their efficiency and resolve. An underground government was established. Allied governments, who had been skeptical about Denmark&#x27;s commitment to fight Germany, began recognising it as a full ally.

Due to concerns about prisoners and information held in Gestapo headquarters at the &quot;Shellhus&quot; in the centre of Copenhagen, the resistance repeatedly requested a tactical RAF raid on the headquarters to destroy records and release prisoners. Britain initially turned down the request due to the risk of civilian casualties, but eventually launched Operation Carthage, a very low-level raid by 20 de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers, escorted by 30 P-51 Mustang fighters. The raid succeeded in destroying the headquarters, releasing 18 prisoners of the Gestapo, and disrupting anti-resistance operations throughout Denmark. However, 125 civilians lost their lives due to the errant bombing of a nearby boarding school.

== Actions ==
In 1943, the movement scored a great success in rescuing all but 500 of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population of 7,000–8,000 from being sent to the Nazi concentration camps by helping transport them to neutral Sweden, where they were offered asylum. The Danish resistance movement has been honoured as a collective at Yad Vashem in Israel as being part of the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. They were honoured as a collective rather than as individuals at their own request.

Another success was the disruption of the Danish railway network in the days after D-Day, which delayed the movement of German troops to France as reinforcements.

By the end of the war, the organized resistance movement in Denmark had scored many successes. It is believed to have killed nearly 400 persons (the top official number is 385) from 1943 through 1945, who were Danish Nazis, informers or collaborators thought to pose a threat to the Resistance, or Danes working for the Gestapo. The rationale behind the executions was discussed, and several accounts by participants said a committee identified targets, but no historic evidence of this system has been found. In the postwar period, while the killings were criticized, they were also defended by such politicians as Frode Jakobsen and Per Federspiel.

The movement lost slightly more than 850 members in action, in prison, in Nazi concentration camps, or (in the case of 102 resistance members) executed following a court-martial.

The Danish National Museum maintains the Museum of Danish Resistance in Copenhagen.

Since the late 20th century, there has been more discussion about the morality of some of the killings carried out by the resistance, sparked by a TV series about the death of Jane Horney, a Danish citizen killed at sea in what Frode Jakobsen defended as an act of war.

With the 60th anniversary of the end of the war, the issue was re-examined in two new studies: Stefan Emkjar&#x27;s &quot;Stikkerdrab&quot; and Peter Ovig Knudsen&#x27;s &quot;Etter drabet&quot;, &quot;the first profound approaches into the topic.&quot; Both authors used veterans of the resistance movement, and covered the sometimes contingent, improvised nature of some of the actions. It suggested that some of the noted Bent Faurschou-Hviid (&quot;Flammen&quot;)&#x27;s executions may have been mistakenly directed by a double agent. Knudsen&#x27;s work was adapted as a two-hour documentary film, &quot;With the Right to Kill&quot; (2003), which was shown on TV and later released in theaters. These works have contributed to a national discussion on the topic. &quot;Flame and Citron&quot; (Flammen og Citronen, 2008) is a fictionalized drama film based on historic accounts of the two prominent Danish resistance fighters, directed by Ole Christian Madsen. It portrays some of the moral ambiguity of their actions.

==Strategic result==
The extent to which the Danish resistance played an important strategic role in the war has been the subject of much discussion. Immediately after the war and until about 1970, the vast majority of accounts overrated the degree to which the resistance had been effective in battling against the Germans by acts of sabotage and by providing key intelligence to the Allies. More recently, however, after re-examining the archives, historians concur that, while the resistance provided a firm basis for moral support and paved the way for post-war governments, the strategic effect during the occupation was limited. The Germans did not need to send reinforcements to suppress the movement, and garrisoned the country with a comparatively small number of Wehrmacht troops. The resistance did not enter into active combat. Even the overall importance of Danish intelligence in the context of Ultra is questionable.

In his history, &quot;No Small Achievement: Special Operations Executive and the Danish Resistance 1940-1945&quot; (2002), Knud Jespersen examined the relationship between British Intelligence and the Danish Resistance. He quoted a report from SHAEF stating that the resistance in Denmark. 
&quot;caused strain and embarrassment to the enemy...[and a] striking reduction in the flow of troops and stores from Norway [that] undoubtedly had an adverse effect on the reinforcements for the battles East and West of the Rhine.&quot;Examining the British archives, Jespersen also found a report concluding &quot;that the overall effect of Danish resistance was to restore national pride and political unity.&quot; He agreed that this was the movement&#x27;s most important contribution to the nation.

<text>Rockaway Inlet is a strait connecting Jamaica Bay, wholly within New York City, with the Atlantic Ocean. It separates the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens from the Floyd Bennett Field (formerly Barren Island) in Brooklyn.

== Description ==
Rockaway Inlet is bounded by Brooklyn to the north and Rockaway Peninsula to the south. It is the entrance to Jamaica Bay, and most of the inlet is within the boundary of Gateway National Recreation Area. Its entrance is marked by a light on a jetty extending southward from Rockaway Point. The entrance channel extends westward of the jetty and is marked by lighted buoys. It has a depth of about 15 feet midchannel with a shoal of only one foot. In 1968 a light failed and the tanker &quot;Mary A. Whalen&quot; ran aground, resulting in a case entitled &quot;United States v. Reliable Transfer Co.&quot; about dividing damage payments.

The inlet is spanned by the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge.

<doc id="470969" wikidata="Q469482" url="?curid=470969" title="American University of Beirut">
<text>The American University of Beirut (AUB; ) is a private, non-sectarian, and independent university chartered in New York with its main campus in Beirut, Lebanon. AUB is governed by a private, autonomous board of trustees and offers programs leading to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, MD, and PhD degrees.

AUB has an operating budget of $423 million with an endowment of approximately $768 million. The campus is composed of 64 buildings, including the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC, formerly known as AUH – American University Hospital) (420 beds), four libraries, three museums and seven dormitories. Almost one-fifth of AUB&#x27;s students attended secondary school or university outside Lebanon before coming to AUB. AUB graduates reside in more than 120 countries worldwide. The language of instruction is English. Degrees awarded at the university are officially registered with the New York Board of Regents.

==History==

On January 23, 1862, W. M. Thomson proposed to a meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that a college of higher learning, that would include medical training, should be established in Beirut with Dr. Daniel Bliss as its president. On April 24, 1863, while Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College. The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened with a class of 16 students on December 3, 1866. Bliss served as its first president, from 1866 until 1902. In the beginning Arabic was used as the language of instruction because it was the common language of the ethnic groups of the region, and prospective students needed to be fluent in Ottoman Turkish or in French as well as in English. In 1887 the language of instruction became English.

AUB alumni have had an impact on the region and the world for many years. For example, 20 AUB alumni were delegates to the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945—more than any other university in the world. AUB graduates continue to serve in leadership positions as presidents of their countries, prime ministers, members of parliament, ambassadors, governors of central banks, presidents and deans of colleges and universities, academics, business people, scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, and nurses. They work in governments, the private sector, and in nongovernmental organizations.

During the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) AUB pursued various means to preserve the continuity of studies, including enrollment agreements with universities in the United States. In 1982 acting president David S. Dodge was kidnapped on campus by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim extremists. On January 18, 1984, AUB President Malcolm H. Kerr was murdered outside his office by members of Islamic Jihad, which preceded the Hezbollah. In 1984 and 1985 a number of university staff were kidnapped, including electrical engineering professor Frank Regier, professor J. Leigh Douglas, professor Philip Padfield, professor Joseph Cicippio, dean of the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences Thomas Sutherland (held captive from 1985 to 1991), director David Jacobsen, and librarian Peter Kilburn (killed by his captors). In all, 30 university-connected people were kidnapped during the war.

On 8 November 1991 a car-bomb demolished the main administrative building, killing one member of staff. The New York Times reported that it was believed to have been set off by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists. Another source states that Hassan Abd al-Nabih, a senior intelligence officer in the South Lebanon Army was accused of being responsible.

The university of Beirut (AUB) established a new campus, AUB Mediterraneo, in Paphos, Cyprus, in 2024. The official inauguration took place on September 4, 2024.

AUBMC, which is accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCIA) on hospital accreditation, includes a 420-bed hospital and offers comprehensive tertiary/quaternary medical care and referral services in a wide range of specialties and medical, nursing, and paramedical training programs at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels.

Throughout its history, the AUB Medical Center, which was formerly known as the American University Hospital (AUH), has played a critical role in caring for the victims of regional and local conflicts. It provided care for the sick and wounded during World War I and World War II, the Lebanese Civil War, and the Palestinian conflict. In recent years, it has provided care for a number of Syrian refugees at the Medical Center in Beirut, at partner hospitals, and at mobile clinics.

Since 1905, AUB&#x27;s medical services have included a nursing school. In 2008, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) invited AUB&#x27;s Rafic Hariri School of Nursing to become a full member, making it the first member of the AACN outside the United States. The American Nurses Credentialing Center&#x27;s (ANCC) Magnet Recognition Program awarded AUBMC its prestigious Magnet designation on June 23, 2009. AUBMC is the first healthcare institution in the Middle East and the third in the world outside the United States to receive this award.

AUBMC now includes the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing Building, the Pierre Abu Khater Outpatient Building, the Wassef and Souad Sawwaf Building, the Medical Administration Building, the Halim and Aida Daniel Academic and Clinical Center, and the Inpatient and Outpatient hospital buildings.

The university is also home to several Clinical and Research Centers of Excellence such as the Mamdouha El-Sayed Bobst Breast Unit, the Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute, the Abu-Haidar Neuroscience Institute, the Children&#x27;s Cancer Center of Lebanon (affiliated with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee), the Moufid Farra Heart and Vascular Outpatient Center, the Nehme and Therese Tohme Multiple Sclerosis Center, and the Ahmad and Jamila Bizri Neuro Outpatient Center. They address health issues endemic to the Arab region such as cancer, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, blood disorders, and mental illness.

As part of the AUBMC 2020 vision, AUBMC held a groundbreaking ceremony for its New Medical Center Expansion Under the Patronage of President Michel Aoun in May 2019.

== American University of Beirut Press ==
American University of Beirut Press (also known as AUB Press) is a university press supported by American University of Beirut, Lebanon. The press specializes in the publication of monographs and edited collections pertaining to Lebanon and the Middle East.

The press in its current form can trace its origin back to 1969, when a formal publications office for the American University of Beirutthe Office of Publicationswas created. In 2001, the university began publishing works under the &quot;American University of Beirut Press&quot; name, and in 2004, the Office of Publications was split into an Office of University Publications (later renamed the &quot;Office of Communications&quot;) and the press itself, which answered to the Office of the Provost.

==University museums and collections==
There are three museums at AUB: the Archaeological Museum, the Geology Museum, and the Natural History Museum.

The Archaeological Museum is the third oldest museum in the Near East. Its collection includes more than 16,000 objects and 10,000 coins and features pottery, prehistoric flint tools, bronze figurines, Phoenician and classical sculptures and bas-reliefs, Egyptian alabaster vases from Byblos, hairpins, and musical instruments. The museum has conducted excavations in Lebanon and Syria. The Society of the Friends of the AUB Museum organizes lectures, exhibits, and activities for children.

The Geology Museum includes rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world.

The Natural History Museum houses a unique collection that represents the biodiversity of the area. It is especially well known for the Post Herbarium, which includes 63,000 specimens.

AUB&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections includes important documents related to the founding of the Syrian Protestant College in 1866 and also many materials (documents, maps, photographs, etc.) of interest to scholars of Lebanon and the region including the Beirut Codex, a New Testament in Syriac, dating back to the ninth or tenth century; the E. W. Blatchford Collection (photographs of the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa taken between 1880 and 1900); and political and cultural posters dating back to the 1940s.

The American University of Beirut has embarked upon a new initiative (AUB Art Galleries and Collections) to play an active role in promoting fine and contemporary art in the region.
The very first step taken in this new direction coincided with the generous donation of Samir Saleeby to AUB. The Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Collection includes paintings by artists of different generations, ranging from Khalil Saleeby (1870–1928) and Cesar Gemayal (1898–1958) to Omar Onsi (1901–1969) and Saliba Douaihy (1912–1994). It also features works by Haidar Hamaoui (b. 1937), Chucrallah Fattouh (b. 1956), and Robert Khoury (b. 1923). The Saleeby donation is the cornerstone upon which AUB will establish a comprehensive collection of modern and contemporary art from the region.
The new initiative commenced with the launching of new art spaces located in and around AUB campus: the Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Museum in Sidani Street and the Byblos Bank Art Gallery, in Ada Dodge Hall (on campus).

The AUB curates the Palestinian Oral History Archive (POHA), an Oral history preservation project. Other notable Palestinian oral history archives are the Palestinian Oral History Map, Columbia University&#x27;s Oral History Project in New York, Duke University&#x27;s Palestinian Oral History Project, the Palestinian Rural History Project, Palestine Remembered, and Zochrot.

<text>The Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge (originally Cross Bay Bridge or Cross Bay Parkway Bridge) is a toll bridge that carries Cross Bay Boulevard across Jamaica Bay in Queens, New York City, between Broad Channel and the Rockaway Peninsula.

== Description and history ==
Planning for a bridge across Jamaica Bay, connecting Howard Beach with Rockaway Beach via Beach Channel, had begun by 1917. Construction began in 1923. The bridge was intended to save travel time for people in Manhattan traveling to the Rockaways. The bridge was designed by the engineering firm of Madigan-Hyland. Contractor J. Rich Steers, Inc., built the bridge for the New York City Parkway Authority, which was later merged into the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The bridge was a part of a program to develop Jamaica Bay as a recreational area instead of an industrial port. The bridge opened in 1925, at a cost of $7million (equivalent to $million in ).

The original bridge was intended to sufficiently handle traffic for many years to come, but by 1929 it was already becoming overly congested. The bridge was replaced with a newer, low-level bascule bridge in the same location that was opened on June 3, 1939, at a cost of $33million (equivalent to $million in ). It consisted of a widened version of the previous drawbridge, and a grade-separated interchange complex feeding into Beach Channel Drive and the Cross Bay Parkway. The Cross Bay Parkway was extended south along Beach 94th Street and Beach 95th Street to the Shore Front Parkway along Rockaway Beach. Following its completion, Harry Taylor, head of the New York City Parkway Authority, said it had &quot;transformed the old-time beach resort of blighted shacks, cheap amusements and limited play space into a modern playground of the type and character of Jones Beach.&quot;

The bridge was reconstructed at a cost of $26million (equivalent to $million in ) and opened to traffic on May 28, 1970. The current bridge is a high-level fixed bridge carrying six traffic lanes and a sidewalk on the west side. The bridge was built high in order to allow boats pass under without the delays caused by the previous drawbridge. The bridge is operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

== Tolls ==
, drivers pay $5.60 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $2.60 per car or $2.17 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $4.11 per car or $3.46 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

Until 2010, residents of the Rockaways and Broad Channel could cross the bridge for free. Residents of Broad Channel and the Rockaways who have an E-ZPass pay $1.19 per crossing if they cross up to twice per day, but are not charged if they cross more than twice in 24 hours. The new toll for area residents was part of a series of Metropolitan Transportation Authority budget cuts. Starting in February 2024, all drivers who have a Queens address and a NYCSC E-ZPass have received a 100 percent rebate; Queens residents are automatically enrolled in the program. Residents of the Rockaways and Broad Channel receive not only a 100 percent rebate on Cross Bay Bridge tolls but also a reduced toll at the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge.

Open-road cashless tolling began on April 30, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay with cash or tokens at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were located. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly. Residents with leftover bridge tokens were eligible to redeem their tokens for a refund through the E-ZPass Customer Service prior to April 29, 2017.

<text>Doreen Elizabeth Massey, Baroness Massey of Darwen (; 5 September 1938 – 20 April 2024), was a British life peer and a Labour member of the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==
Massey was born Doreen Elizabeth Hall to Mary Ann Hall () and Jack Hall on 5 September 1938. Raised in Darwen, Lancashire, she was educated Darwen Grammar School, where she was head girl, and attended the University of Birmingham, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French in 1961 and a Diploma of Education in 1962. At Birmingham, she was the vice-president of the student union and gained blues in hockey and cricket. Massey later studied at the University of London, Institute of Education, gaining a Master of Arts degree in 1985.

==Career==
A former teacher and education advisor, she was the director of the Family Planning Association from 1989 to 1994. She was made a life peer as Baroness Massey of Darwen, of Darwen in the County of Lancashire, on 26 July 1999. She was introduced on 1 November 1999 to the House of Lords where she served as a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Integrated and Complementary Healthcare.

Massey was an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, patron of Humanists UK, and vice chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group.

On 15 September 2010, Massey, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

On 28 January 2019 Massey was the only person to remove her name from an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing the &quot;US attempt at regime change&quot; in Venezuela. The letter was signed by Shadow Ministers, MPs, union leaders, Labour Party NEC members, cultural figures, academics, anti-war campaigners and others.

===LGBT rights===
In January 2022, Massey and four other Labour delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe tabled ten amendments to Resolution 2417, &quot;Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe&quot;. The amendments sought to include the word &quot;sex&quot; alongside gender identity, de-conflate the situation in the UK from Hungary, Poland, Russia and Turkey, and remove references to alleged anti-LGBTI movements in the UK. The delegates received both praise and criticism.

==Personal life and death==
Doreen Hall married Leslie Massey in 1966. They had two sons and a daughter.

Baroness Massey died following a long illness with cancer at a hospice in North Chailey, near Haywards Heath, on 20 April 2024. She was 85.

<doc id="470985" wikidata="Q125635" url="?curid=470985" title="Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel">
<text>The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, commonly referred to as the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, Battery Tunnel or Battery Park Tunnel, is a tolled tunnel in New York City that connects Red Hook in Brooklyn with the Battery in Manhattan. The tunnel consists of twin tubes that each carry two traffic lanes under the mouth of the East River. Although it passes just offshore of Governors Island, the tunnel does not provide vehicular access to the island. With a length of , it is the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in North America.

Plans for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel date back to the 1920s. Official plans to build the tunnel were submitted in 1930 but were initially not carried out. The New York City Tunnel Authority, created in 1936, was tasked with constructing the tunnel. After unsuccessful attempts to secure federal funds, New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses proposed a Brooklyn–Battery Bridge. However, the public opposed the bridge plan, and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) rejected the plan several times out of concern that the bridge would impede shipping access to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This prompted city officials to reconsider plans for a tunnel. Construction on the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel started on October 28, 1940, but its completion was delayed due to World War II-related material shortages. The tunnel officially opened on May 25, 1950.

The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel is part of the Interstate Highway System, carrying the entirety of the unsigned Interstate 478 (I-478) since 1971. The tunnel originally carried New York State Route 27A (NY 27A) until 1970. In 2012, the tunnel was officially renamed after former New York Governor Hugh Carey. It is operated by MTA Bridges and Tunnels as one of the MTA&#x27;s nine tolled crossings.

==Description==
The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel consists of two two-lane tubes, one in each direction. They pass underneath the East River, connecting the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan to the neighborhood of Red Hook in Brooklyn. Although the tubes do not pass directly under Governors Island, that island contains a ventilation building for the tunnel. Vehicles taller than and wider than are prohibited from using the tubes. The tubes stretch from portal to portal, making them the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnels in North America. At the time of its opening, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was the longest underwater vehicular tunnel in the US and the second-longest in the world, behind the Queensway tunnel under the River Mersey in the UK. The portals of each tube contain flood doors weighing and measuring thick, across, and tall.

The tunnel was originally commissioned by the New York City Tunnel Authority, whose chief engineer Ole Singstad created the tunnel&#x27;s original designs. Halfway through construction, the Tunnel Authority was merged into the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), whose chief engineer Ralph Smillie took over the design process. The &quot;Battery&quot; in the tunnel&#x27;s name refers to an artillery battery originally located at that site during New York City&#x27;s earliest days. The tunnel was officially renamed after former Governor Hugh Carey in 2012 since he had lived in Brooklyn.

The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel is owned and operated by the TBTA&#x27;s successor MTA Bridges and Tunnels, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Until 2017, the agency collected tolls at a tollbooth on the Brooklyn side. The tollbooths have been demolished and replaced with electronic toll gantries on the Manhattan side. , the tunnel is used by 54,076 vehicles on an average weekday.

===Associated structures===
The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel has a total of four ventilation buildings: two in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn, and one on Governors Island. One of the Manhattan ventilation buildings is granite-faced and designed like a monument due to objections to the building&#x27;s design during the construction process. The Manhattan ventilation structure was depicted as the men in black&#x27;s headquarters in the Men in Black movie franchise.

The Governors Island ventilation structure, designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White, is an octagonal building located over the midpoint of the tunnel&#x27;s route, at its lowest point. According to the MTA, the ventilation buildings can completely replace the tunnel&#x27;s air every 90 seconds. During construction, tunnel engineers touted the ventilation system as being so efficient that the ventilation towers could blow of clean air into the tunnel every hour. The system consists of 53 fans that each had a diameter of .

At the Manhattan end, a 2,126-space parking garage sits above the approach to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel from the West Side Highway. When the garage opened in 1950, it had 1,050 spaces across seven levels, which were constructed at a cost of $3.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). The parking facility was expanded in 1965–1968 due to its popularity among motorists. The garage was the city&#x27;s first publicly owned parking lot.

===Transportation===
The tunnel carries 28 express bus routes that connect Manhattan with Brooklyn or Staten Island. The MTA Bus Company operates the BM1, BM2, BM3, and BM4 between Manhattan and Brooklyn. MTA New York City Transit operates the SIM1, SIM1C, SIM2, SIM3, SIM3C, SIM4, SIM4C, SIM4X, SIM5, SIM6, SIM7, SIM9, SIM10, SIM15, SIM31, SIM32, SIM33, SIM33C, SIM34, and SIM35 routes between Manhattan and Staten Island and the X27, X28, X37, and X38 between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

==History==

=== Planning ===
A vehicular tunnel under the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn was proposed by the New York Board of Trade and Transportation in 1925 in response to growing truck traffic congestion in Lower Manhattan. The tunnel would have been located between the Manhattan Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. A tunnel that specifically connected the Battery in Manhattan with Red Hook in Brooklyn, passing underneath the East River and Governors Island south of both the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, was first proposed by Brooklyn Borough president James J. Byrne in 1926. However, this plan initially did not receive support. Albert Goldman, the New York City Commissioner of Plant and Structures, brought up the plan again in January 1929. In February 1930, the city publicized plans for a six-lane vehicular tunnel from West Street, Manhattan, to Hamilton Avenue, Brooklyn. At the time, ferry service along that path was slow and unreliable. Real-estate speculators believed that land prices along Hamilton Avenue would appreciate as a result of the tunnel&#x27;s construction and that freight shipments could be delivered to Manhattan faster. The tunnel proposal also entailed widening Hamilton Avenue to and building a large bridge over the Gowanus Canal, south of the proposed tunnel&#x27;s entrance.

In May 1930, the Terminal Bridge Corporation petitioned the New York City Board of Estimate for permission to build and operate a tunnel under the East River. In November of that year, the Board of Estimate referred the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel plan to the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT), who was tasked with surveying the site of the tunnel. At the time, the tunnel would have cost $75 million (equivalent to $ in ), including land acquisition if it included two three-lane tunnels. The tunnels itself would have cost $58 million (equivalent to $ in ) if they were three lanes or $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) if two lanes. The next year, NYCBOT announced that the construction the proposed tunnel was estimated to cost $60 million (equivalent to $ in ), assuming that the tunnels were in diameter with roadways and a clearance. In October 1933, the Board of Estimate approved funding for the tunnel in the city&#x27;s capital outlay budget for 1934. Two months later, the Board of Estimate approved the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel in conjunction with a Staten Island–Brooklyn tunnel under the Narrows. The city was set to ask for $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) in federal funding, but this request was dropped from the final vote.

Mayor Fiorello La Guardia set up a public-works authority in February 1935 so the city could apply for loans from the federal Public Works Administration (PWA). This authority was set to receive $60 million (equivalent to $ in ) in funds for the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel. The same month, city officials hired temporary workers to survey sites for the proposed tunnel so that they could create a report for the PWA application. Civic groups and Brooklyn politicians petitioned the city to commence construction immediately so traffic congestion could be reduced. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had stipulated that PWA funding only be given to projects that could be finished within a year of the grant being awarded. Since the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel project would take longer, it and other New York City highway projects were ineligible for PWA funding.

In January 1936, the New York State Legislature created the New York City Tunnel Authority to oversee the construction of a tunnel between Midtown Manhattan and Queens. The bill also provided the authority with the power to build the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel if funds became available. By this time, the construction cost of the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel was now projected to be $58 million (equivalent to $ in ). Detailed plans for the tunnel were released in May 1936. The project now consisted of a $60.3-million (equivalent to $ in ) twin-tube bore from Red Hook, Brooklyn, to the Battery, Manhattan, as well as a $2.3-million (equivalent to $ in ) bridge over the Gowanus Canal. The city approved these plans in January 1936. One civic group wanted to plan for future traffic volumes, so it asked the city to conduct further studies of the Brooklyn–Manhattan tunnel project. The tunnel was officially renamed the &quot;Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel&quot; in July 1936. In November of that year, Brooklyn Borough President Raymond Ingersoll and New York City Parks commissioner Robert Moses revealed a plan to connect the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel to Long Island&#x27;s parkway system via a new Gowanus Parkway and Circumferential Parkway. The planned tunnel was also part of the Regional Plan Association&#x27;s proposed parkway system around New York City. The next month, the New York City Tunnel Authority advertised for bids to create test bores for the tunnel.

Copies of the plans for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel were submitted to La Guardia&#x27;s mayoral administration in February 1937. Two tunnels, one in each direction, would connect to the West Side Highway and the FDR Drive on the Manhattan side and to Hamilton Avenue on the Brooklyn side. In the future, the West Side Elevated Highway would be extended from the north, connecting to the new tunnel. There would be a ventilation tower at the midpoint on Governors Island because the tunnels would stretch between the two portals, and it was thought that the ventilation towers at either end might not pull in sufficient air. The tunnels would be designed to carry a maximum of 15 million vehicles per year, but it was projected that only nine million would use the tunnels during their first year of operation and that the tunnels would not reach their full capacity for another 16 years. The cost of the project had increased to $70 million (equivalent to $ in ), and La Guardia wanted a $30-million (equivalent to $ in ) federal grant so construction could start quickly. A toll of $0.25 per motorist, collected at the Brooklyn end, would help finance the rest of the tunnel and make it profitable. The tunnel would also halve travel time between southern Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan since, at the time, there was no direct route for traffic between these two areas. This, in turn, was expected to expedite cargo deliveries between these areas, thereby reviving Brooklyn&#x27;s declining cargo industry. The route between Hamilton Avenue and the West Side Highway was determined to be the cheapest route that could be constructed.

Although preliminary borings were set to start in February 1937, USACE officers on Governors Island opposed the placement of a ventilation tunnel there. The Tunnel Authority let contracts for borings in April 1938. The US Army, which held a hearing for public opinions on the tunnel proposal, gave its permission to the tunnel plan in September 1938.

The Tunnel Authority suggested that federal funding could be used to pay for the tunnel and that private financing could also be provided if it was needed. In June 1938, the city requested a $70.9-million (equivalent to $ in ) PWA grant for the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. The next month, La Guardia met with PWA chair Harold L. Ickes and Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) chair Jesse H. Jones to convince them to help fund the tunnel because the project could now be completed within a year. The city government then published a new financial plan in September 1938, wherein the cost of the tunnel would increase to $77.3 million (equivalent to $ in ). The city would reduce its request from the PWA by $19.82 million (equivalent to $ in ) and raise that money by selling bonds instead, and it would also apply for $45 million (equivalent to $ in ) from the RFC. Manhattan Borough President Stanley M. Isaacs objected to the tunnel plan because he thought the proposal would not be able to adequately handle traffic on the Manhattan side. In response, Parks Commissioner Moses asked Isaacs to think of a better idea to deal with the traffic. Ickes later rejected the city&#x27;s request for PWA funds, saying that there were &quot;tremendous financial and practical obstacles&quot; for any further PWA involvement. These impediments included a lack of money because, although the PWA had given the city an appropriation for the Belt Parkway, the money had been used up. Due to the PWA&#x27;s refusal to grant a loan for the Battery Tunnel&#x27;s construction, the project was temporarily put on hold.

=== Bridge proposal ===

In January 1939, after the failure to allocate federal funds to the tunnels, Moses (now the chair of the Triborough Bridge Authority) proposed the Brooklyn–Battery Bridge. He stated that constructing a bridge would be cheaper, faster, and more efficient than building a tunnel. The bridge would consist of a six-lane tandem suspension bridge span with two back-to-back suspension bridges, and it could be built in 27 months, compared to 46 months for a tunnel. One of the other benefits, in Moses&#x27;s opinion, was that the $41-million (equivalent to $ in ) bridge would not require any federal money. Isaacs stated that a bridge would cause as much congestion as a tunnel would, so he did not favor the bridge plan. The Tunnel Authority also opposed the Brooklyn–Battery Bridge because a bridge would lower property values. In response, Moses predicted that the Tunnel Authority&#x27;s Queens–Midtown Tunnel would not be profitable and that the Tunnel Authority should organize its existing affairs before deciding to build a new tunnel.

Moses was able to garner support for the bridge from influential city and state politicians, including four of five borough presidents, Mayor La Guardia, and US Senator Robert F. Wagner. In early March 1939, the New York City Planning Commission endorsed plans for the Battery Bridge, and a bill for the bridge was moved to a vote in the state legislature. The bill was proposed for a vote in the City Council, but this was blocked due to concerns that the bridge&#x27;s connection to the East River Drive would not be able to accommodate future traffic volumes. The American Institute of Architects asked that the city reconsider the bridge, as it would obstruct the dramatic view of the Manhattan skyline, reduce the Battery to minuscule size, and destroy the Great New York Aquarium at Castle Clinton. There was significant opposition from the public, and so the City Council Committee on State Legislation did not approve the plan. In response, Moses changed the Brooklyn–Battery Bridge plans to include landscaping work at the Battery. La Guardia believed that if this revised plan were passed, Ickes would finally allocate a PWA grant to the bridge project. On March 28, the City Council voted to approve the bridge project, with 19 members in favor and six opposed. Two days later, both chambers of the New York State Legislature passed bills that permitted the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Bridge, and Governor Herbert H. Lehman signed the bills within the week.

Moses quickly sought to obtain approval from the US Department of War, which needed to approve the plan. He also started looking for PWA and RFC financing so the bridge could be completed by July 1941. As part of the approval process, the US Army held a public hearing to solicit opinions on the bridge plan. To solidify their opposition to the bridge plans, 17 civic groups formed a committee, and the Municipal Art Society criticized the proposed bridge as an act of &quot;vandalism&quot; toward the city&#x27;s public parks. Opponents claimed that the bridge would block naval traffic, a suggestion that La Guardia and Moses refuted.

The Department of War ultimately declined to endorse the Brooklyn–Battery Bridge. In May 1939 Robert Woodring, the US Secretary of War, blocked the construction of the bridge due to concerns over the span&#x27;s potential to become a naval obstruction during a war, since the Brooklyn Navy Yard was located shoreward of the proposed bridge. In response, Moses submitted a revised plan for the bridge and asked the Department of War to reconsider. Moses and Brooklyn politicians declared that they would not accept anything other than an endorsement of the second plan. However, in July, the War Department also rejected the second plan, since the new plan would also pose a wartime hazard. Advocates for the bridge called the rejection a &quot;setback to business&quot;. They also discounted the decision as hypocritical since numerous other bridges (including the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, which stood between the proposed bridge and the Navy Yard) would also constitute wartime hazards by the Army&#x27;s reasoning.

Moses continued to support the bridge, praising it as less intrusive and cheaper than a tunnel, despite great public opposition to a bridge. In October, in a last effort to garner official acceptance for the Battery Bridge plan, Moses and La Guardia appealed directly to President Roosevelt to form an independent committee to study the proposal. Moses again revised the plan, adding a ramp to Governors Island so the Army forces could also use the bridge, in a fashion similar to the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge&#x27;s connection to the Army reservation on Yerba Buena Island in California. However, Roosevelt upheld the Department of War&#x27;s decision and declined to create such a committee.

=== Tunnel plans finalized ===

In July 1939, after the bridge plan was canceled, the proposal for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was revisited. Around this time, Roosevelt&#x27;s administration was considering loosening PWA requirements and lowering interest rates so that the Battery Tunnel could qualify for these funds. By November, La Guardia was arranging to obtain financing for the tunnel, even if it had to come from private sources. After a meeting with La Guardia, RFC chair Jones announced that there were no obstacles to granting a $70-million (equivalent to $ in ) loan toward the tunnel project. The city was expecting to start construction once the loan was received. The tunnel plans were completed and sent to federal agencies for approval that month.

The New York City Tunnel Authority announced in March 1940 that it would start construction within 40 days. Preliminary construction and land acquisition for the Brooklyn approach was already underway. The Army had already approved the tunnel but, due to a minor change in the plan, had to hold another hearing, and the Army was expected to uphold the permit. In May, La Guardia signed a preliminary contract to start construction. Moses stated that he wanted to complete the tunnel, a crucial link in the Circumferential Parkway System, as soon as possible. The RFC granted the city $57 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the tunnel project later that month. Ole Singstad, the chief engineer of the New York City Tunnel Authority, was commissioned to design the tunnel. As a cost-saving measure, the Tunnel Authority briefly considered constructing the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel by digging a trench under the East River and then covering it up.

In mid-1940, 400 Brooklyn residents living in the tunnel&#x27;s right-of-way were evicted. On the Manhattan side, a large part of Little Syria, a mostly Christian Syrian/Lebanese neighborhood centered around Washington Street, was razed to create the entrance ramps for the tunnel. Many of the shops and residents of Little Syria later moved to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The city ultimately spent $4 million (equivalent to $ in ) on land acquisition.

=== Construction starts ===
The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony was supposed to be held on October 8, 1940, with President Roosevelt in attendance. At the time, the president was in the final weeks of his reelection campaign for the 1940 United States presidential election, and he was expected to campaign at several places around New York City. The groundbreaking was ultimately pushed back to October 28. At the ceremony, Roosevelt extolled the benefits of a tunnel as opposed to a bridge, while Mayor La Guardia invited the president to return for the opening ceremony in four years. Three days later, the city approved a motion to widen Hamilton Avenue from to make way for the Brooklyn tunnel approach, as well as awarded a contract for the tunnel&#x27;s lining to Bethlehem Steel.

The start of actual tunneling was delayed due to dispute between a dockworkers&#x27; union, which was commissioned to dig the tunnel, and a sandhogs&#x27; union, which claimed that its members were entitled to work on the project because the sandhogs specialized in building tunnels. This disagreement turned into a violent protest and multiday strike in February 1941. The next year, some union sandhog workers were banned from working on the Battery Tunnel project due to a disagreement with their union&#x27;s parent union.

Another issue arose when it was revealed that the Great New York Aquarium at Castle Clinton, at the Battery on the Manhattan side, would need to be demolished to make way for the tunnel. The aquarium considered moving to Coney Island on the southern shore of Brooklyn. To expedite construction of the tunnel, the city closed the Great New York Aquarium and moved its fish to other aquariums in September 1941. Moses advocated for the demolition of Castle Clinton, but preservationists who opposed Moses&#x27;s proposed action asked federal judge to grant an injunction to prevent demolition. Even though Moses initially had the injunction dismissed, the federal government later designated the castle a US historic monument, which prohibited him from demolishing the castle. The tunnel project would also require demolishing of the Battery in order to build a seawall, and, as a result of the downsizing of the Battery, an architect was hired to study the redesign of the park. This, in turn, led to a public competition for potential park redesigns.

In August 1940, the city filed plans for two drawbridges across the Gowanus Canal as part of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel approach project. The US Army officially approved plans for the Gowanus Canal bridge in October, just before the tunnel was set to begin construction. The Gowanus bridge&#x27;s contract was awarded in December 1940. A contract for the Gowanus Parkway approach to the tunnel and bridge was awarded the next month. In mid-1941, planners realized that Hicks Street, on the Brooklyn side, would also need to be widened so that traffic from the north could enter the tunnel, whose Brooklyn portal faced southeast. By May 1942, the Gowanus Parkway was completed between Hicks Street and the Belt Parkway. The parkway also included a bridge over the Gowanus Canal, a fixed span rising above the waterway before descending to Hicks Street. Construction on an extension of the highway along Hicks Street did not start until 1946.

A new plan for the Manhattan approaches was released in mid-1941. This plan, believed to reduce traffic congestion, consisted of extending the West Side Elevated Highway south to the Battery with a ramp from the southbound highway leading directly into the tunnel. The Battery Park Underpass would be built between the West Side Highway and the FDR Drive. As a result, the approaches to the tunnel would only need to connect to the west side of the Battery, and traffic accessing the North River piers on the West Side would not be interrupted by tunnel traffic. However, this was not the case for traffic from Brooklyn, which would have to go through a traffic light before accessing the ramp for the elevated highway.

The tunnel-boring project consisted of digging two separate bores from each end. Bids for digging the tunnel&#x27;s shafts from the Brooklyn side were advertised and let the same month. Contracts for boring the tunnels from the Manhattan side were opened in May 1941. The Manhattan contract was awarded to Mason Hangar in October of the same year. A contest for designing the Governors Island ventilation building was also held, and the contract was ultimately given to the architectural firm McKim, Mead &amp; White. The last tunneling project, a contract to dig in either direction from Governors Island until the tubes connected to each other, was advertised in December 1941.

=== Construction halts and restarts ===
The tunnel was originally expected for completion by 1944. La Guardia had promised that, during World War II, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel would be given priority status over other construction projects due to its importance to the Brooklyn economy. However, the Battery Tunnel project was not deemed a high-importance destination for steel, so the tunnel&#x27;s priority status for the receipt of steel was revoked in February 1942. Although digging work continued, the tunnel could not be finished until after the war. In October 1942, Moses recommended that tunnel work be halted completely to conserve steel and other metals that were needed for the war. At this time, the federal War Production Board (WPB) released an order to stop work on the Brooklyn end, although digging from the Manhattan side was allowed to continue because that work consisted solely of digging through solid rock. By the end of the month, the WPB ordered a halt to all construction work on the tunnel&#x27;s Manhattan end as well. Due to opposition over potentially firing the sandhogs, they were allowed to continue working until a final review of the WPB&#x27;s action was conducted. At the time, the bores from Manhattan and Brooklyn were in various stages of completion.

By September 1944, the war was winding down and Mayor La Guardia was petitioning the US government to allow the manufacture of washers, nuts, and screws for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel construction effort. The federal government gave its permission the next month. During the war, the tunnel shafts had flooded, so they had to be drained first before construction could continue. In mid-1945, after the war ended, the Triborough Bridge Authority was merged with the Tunnel Authority, allowing the new Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) to take over the project. Moses, the TBTA head, promptly fired Singstad and replaced him with TBTA Chief Engineer Ralph Smillie, who designed the remainder of the tunnel. The WPB approved the resumption of tunnel work in September of that year. The TBTA advertised for bids to construct the Brooklyn toll plaza in May 1946. Because of objections to the proposed Manhattan ventilation building&#x27;s design, the TBTA changed the plans so that the tower would look like a granite monument rather than a simple ventilation tower.

Moses directed the tunnel be finished with a different method for finishing the tunnel walls. This resulted in leaking, and, according to Moses biographer Robert Caro, the TBTA fixed the leaks by using a design almost identical to Singstad&#x27;s original. Singstad later claimed that Smillie had caused &quot;excessive&quot; leakage by not using Singstad&#x27;s experimental caulking design to prevent leaks. Smillie denied that the leakage was excessive and that Singstad&#x27;s caulking method had been replaced because that method was actually the cause of the leak.

Workers from both sides continued working on the tunnel, mining caverns until the tubes from each side connected with each other. In July 1947, the eastern tube for future northbound traffic was the first to be holed-through, with workers from each side shaking hands as a small pipe was passed through from one side to another. The pipe was then removed, and the openings covered up, to prevent drastic changes in pressure at either end of the tube. The tunnels from Manhattan and Brooklyn had connected at a point under Governors Island, with an error of , and work continued until there was enough assurances that the tunnels had equal pressure readings.

After the tunnel was holed through, the TBTA awarded contracts for the construction of the Governors Island ventilation building. Construction on this ventilation building started in January 1949. The plans for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel also included a seven-story parking garage alongside the Manhattan portal, which broke ground in August 1948. The garage was slated to be the first publicly owned parking complex in the city, and so the city government proposed offering lower parking rates compared to privately-owned garages.

The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was slated to be connected with several parkways and highways on either side, which were built in tandem with the tunnel. On the Brooklyn side, the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway was under construction, providing a connector to the tunnel from the north. Although it was substantially complete by December 1948, the expressway could not open until the tunnel was complete. On the Manhattan side, the southernmost section of the West Side Elevated Highway, which connected to the Battery and the future tunnel, opened in November 1948. An extension of the East River Drive (by now renamed the FDR Drive) to the future Battery Park Underpass and Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was approved in 1949. Eventually, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was also slated to connect to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Staten Island. However, the Battery Park Underpass was not expected to be completed until 1952, and the FDR Drive extension would take even longer to be completed. Additionally, although a direct ramp from the Brooklyn-bound tunnel to the northbound Brooklyn–Queens Expressway was planned, construction was being delayed due to the difficulty of evicting tenants within the path of the ramp. Moreover, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge could not be financed, let alone started, until the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was completed.

Due to extra costs caused by delays and striking sandhogs, the authority petitioned the RFC for $14 million (equivalent to $ in ) in funds in August 1947, and, in December of the same year, asked for another $2 million (equivalent to $ in ). In February 1948, the RFC agreed to extend another $28 million (equivalent to $ in ) toward the completion of the tunnel. By mid-1948, the tunnel was 70 percent complete, despite material shortages and cost overruns, and was expected to open to traffic in early 1950. Work on the tunnel progressed, and the tunnel was 94 percent complete by late 1949. A reporter for the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; made an unsanctioned drive between the two ends of the tunnel, noting that tiles, lighting, and a road surface had yet to be added, although the bores themselves were complete. The tubes included four fluorescent-lighting installations with a total of 5,776 bulbs. At the time, it comprised the world&#x27;s largest continuous fluorescent installation in the world and was the first crossing in the city to have fluorescent lights. The strips of clay tiles on the tubes&#x27; ceilings were advertised as the US&#x27;s longest continuous uses of clay tiles.

=== Opening ===

The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel opened to traffic on May 25, 1950, with a ceremony officiated by Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer. Part of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, along Hicks Street from the Battery Tunnel north to Atlantic Avenue, opened the same day. At the time, the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; described the Battery Tunnel as &quot;the nation&#x27;s largest, most modern underwater vehicular tunnel&quot;, which took three minutes to traverse from end to end. The &quot;Eagle&quot; also estimated that the tunnel cost (equivalent to in ) that was built. With a cost of $80 million (equivalent to $ in ), the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was also dubbed the most expensive tunnel in the United States. It was expensive enough that the TBTA had been forced to look around the world for a company that could cover the tunnel&#x27;s $33.5-million (equivalent to $ in ) insurance policy. However, the cost was expected to be counterbalanced, in part, through the $0.35 tolls and the time savings afforded. Truckers at Bush Terminal, located south of the tunnel&#x27;s portal, predicted that they would save 35 minutes a day and $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) a year by driving through the tunnel.

Within the first five and a half hours of its opening, 10,563 motorists had paid a toll to use the tunnel. Within the first day, 40,000 motorists used the tunnel, and, at that rate, it was estimated that the tunnel might see 14 million vehicles per year, 40 percent more than originally estimated. This was in spite of the fact that traffic speeds were limited to , which reduced throughput. The 1,050-spot garage above the tunnel&#x27;s northern portal opened a little more than a month after the tunnel opened. During the Battery Tunnel&#x27;s first year of operation, the tunnel grossed nearly $5.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) in toll revenues, and, according to Caro, exceeded its 15-million-annual-vehicle capacity. Another analysis by the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; found that 13.86 million vehicles had used the tunnel in its first year; this was lower than Caro&#x27;s estimate but higher than both the TBTA&#x27;s initial estimate of 10 million vehicles per year and expert forecasts of eight million annual vehicles.

Some road infrastructure projects at both ends of the tunnel were completed shortly after the tunnel opened. The first associated project to be completed was the Battery Park Underpass on the Manhattan side, which opened in April 1950. Two months later, officials opened a ramp on the Brooklyn side, which led from the southbound tunnel lanes to the northbound Brooklyn–Queens Expressway. The Battery Park Underpass was connected to the FDR Drive elevated viaduct, and thus to the FDR Drive, in May 1954. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel project also entailed the restoration of Battery Park, which reopened in 1952 after a 12-year shutdown.

=== Later years ===
The tubes were designed for two lanes in each direction. This was changed in 1956, when the Brooklyn-bound western tube was changed to handle bidirectional traffic during morning rush hours, owing to heavy rush-hour traffic congestion. A northbound high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane) was later added during the morning rush hours. It led from Staten Island to Manhattan via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Gowanus Expressway, and the Battery Tunnel. A large volume of tunnel drivers also used the garage on the Manhattan side, so in 1965, plans were made to expand the garage. The expanded garage, which was completed in 1968, had 2,126 spots. The city also built a new 278-spot garage nearby for short-term parking.

In 1957, workers performing maintenance on the tunnel observed that the tiled ceiling in the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was leaking. About of the of ceiling was found to have corroded. The TBTA restored the tubes&#x27; ceilings starting in 1959 at a cost of $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

In 1971, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was designated Interstate 478 in preparation for the &quot;Westway&quot; project, which would reconstruct the West Side Highway to Interstate Highway standards. Although the project was canceled in 1985, the I-478 designation still exists and is contiguous with the entirety of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. However, I-478 is not posted on any public signage. Under an agreement with Verizon Wireless, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel received cellular service in 1995.

The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was closed completely after the September 11 attacks due to the proximity of the Manhattan portal to the World Trade Center site. Although many major crossings within the city were also closed following the attacks, they reopened relatively quickly, albeit with HOV restrictions during rush hours. The western tube of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was the first part of the tunnel to reopen, in October 2001, and carried only southbound traffic. However, the West Side Highway was closed to traffic south of Canal Street, some 30 blocks north of the tunnel portal, and part of the highway had been destroyed during the attacks. Consequently, officials feared that traffic in the tunnel would be backed up at least 40 blocks if the highway was reopened. As a result, work started on a temporary roadway leading from the highway to the tunnel. The northbound tube, which reopened in March 2002, was the last crossing into Manhattan to reopen.

In 2010, New York State legislators voted to rename the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel after former Governor Hugh Carey. The tunnel was officially renamed the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel on October 22, 2012. Less than a week after the tunnel was officially renamed, it was closed in preparation for Hurricane Sandy, marking the first-ever weather-related-closure for the tunnel. It was subsequently flooded after a severe storm surge. The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel reopened on November 13 following a cleanup process that included the removal of an estimated of water. It was the last New York City river crossing to reopen.

The flooding resulting from Hurricane Sandy demonstrated how floodprone the tunnel was since the sea level around the tunnel had risen since its opening in 1951, and the portals were located on very low land to begin with. The MTA subsequently began testing inflatable dams at the tunnel&#x27;s portals. In October 2017, a pair of floodgates were installed on the Manhattan-side openings of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel. The Manhattan floodgates were supposed to be accompanied by a pair on the Brooklyn side, as well as a seawall. This combined project was 63 percent complete . In 2017–2018, the tiled walls in the Queens–Midtown and Brooklyn–Battery tunnels were replaced due to damage suffered during Hurricane Sandy. The retiled white walls have gold-and-blue stripes, representing the official state colors of New York. Controversy arose over the cost of retiling the tunnels, which cost a combined $30 million (equivalent to $ in ), because of the ongoing transit crisis at the time.

On September 28, 2023, an 18-wheel tractor entered the Brooklyn-bound tunnel, traveling the wrong way to Manhattan, and got stuck inside the tunnel, backing up traffic for several hours.

==Tolls==
, drivers pay $11.19 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $6.94 per car or $3.02 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $8.36 per car or $3.57 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

The E-ZPass toll payment system has been accepted at the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel since December 1996. Open-road cashless tolling started on January 4, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers were no longer allowed to pay cash at the tunnel. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore are located on the Manhattan side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

===Historical tolls===
===Congestion toll===

Congestion pricing in New York City was implemented in January 2025. Drivers who enter Manhattan via the tunnel pay a second toll if they exit onto Trinity Place. The congestion charges are collected via E-ZPass and tolls-by-mail. The charges vary based on time of day and vehicle class, but the congestion toll is charged once per day. Drivers who use the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel to enter the congestion zone will receive a credit toward the congestion charge during the day, and they would pay a discounted toll at night. Drivers who use the tunnel and then remain on the FDR Drive or West Side Highway south of 60th Street would be exempt from the congestion toll.

==Interstate 478==
I-478 is the official route designation for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and its approaches, although it is not signed as such. I-478&#x27;s south end is at the tunnel&#x27;s south end, I-278 in Brooklyn, and the highway extends to the tunnel&#x27;s north end at NY 9A (West Street) in Lower Manhattan. The entirety of I-478 is concurrent with the tunnel. Before receiving the I-478 designation, the tunnel had been part of NY 27A from the 1950s to 1970. NY 27A still exists, but, since 1970, it only runs within eastern Long Island.

The I-478 number was originally considered for other routes. In 1958, the I-478 route number was proposed for the Lower Manhattan Expressway branch along the Manhattan Bridge. This highway would have run between I-78 (which would have split to another branch that used the Williamsburg Bridge) and I-278. After the Lower Manhattan Expressway project was canceled in March 1971, the I-478 designation was also briefly proposed for an upgrade of the Grand Central Parkway between I-278 and I-678, as part of an effort to upgrade the Belt Parkway with truck lanes. This proposal was also canceled in May 1971.

The Westway project was proposed in early 1971 as part of an effort to replace the West Side Elevated Highway, a narrow and dangerously obsolete structure on Manhattan&#x27;s west side. By mid-1971, the I-478 designation had been moved over to the Westway project. As originally planned, I-478 would have continued north to I-78 at the Holland Tunnel and I-495 at the Lincoln Tunnel via the Westway project. An extension to I-95 at the George Washington Bridge via the Henry Hudson Parkway was initially considered. This was ultimately dropped from the final plan due to a state law that prohibited the conversion of the Henry Hudson Parkway to an Interstate Highway. The project was approved by the US government in 1977.

If fully completed, I-478 would have run along the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and West Side Highway, completing the portion of the Interstate Highway System within New York City. However, the Westway project was officially abandoned in 1985 after a series of lawsuits from environmental advocates. Although the I-478 designation was formally withdrawn from all public signage and plans, the route number still applies to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, albeit as an unsigned highway that is not marked on public signs.

<text>Viscount Hill, of Hawkstone and of Hardwicke in the County of Salop, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1842 for General Rowland Hill. He had already been created Baron Hill, of Almaraz and of Hawkstone in the County of Salop, in 1814, with remainder to the heirs male of his body, and Baron Hill, of Almarez and of Hawkestone and Hardwicke in the County of Salop, in 1816, with remainder to the heirs male of his elder brother John Hill. The viscountcy was created with the same special remainder. On the first Viscount&#x27;s death in 1842, the barony of 1814 became extinct as he had no male issue, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1816 and the viscountcy according to the special remainders by his nephew Sir Rowland Hill, 4th Baronet. His son, the 3rd Viscount, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Shropshire North. In 1875, he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Clegg, which was that of his maternal grandfather. He inherited financial problems from his father which led to the breakup and sale of the family estates.

The Hill, later Clegg-Hill baronetcy, of Hawkestone in the County of Shropshire, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1727 for the first Viscount&#x27;s grandfather Rowland Hill, with remainder to his cousins Samuel Hill, of Shenstone, Thomas Hill, of Tern (whose eldest son Noel Hill was created Baron Berwick in 1784) and Rowland Hill, brother of Thomas. The baronetcy was created in honour of Rowland Hill&#x27;s uncle, the diplomat and statesman the Rev. and Hon. Richard Hill of Hawkstone (1655–1727). Sir Rowland Hill later represented Lichfield in Parliament. His son, Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet, represented Shropshire. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury. His grandson, the fourth Baronet, represented Shropshire and Shropshire North as a Tory, before he succeeded his uncle in the barony and viscountcy of Hill. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. He married Anne Clegg heiress of Peplow Hall in 1831.

A boarding house at Wellington College, Berkshire was named after the first Viscount around the time of the school&#x27;s construction in the 1850s.

The family seat was Hawkstone Hall, near Market Drayton, Shropshire.

<doc id="471003" wikidata="Q2100977" url="?curid=471003" title="Manzila Uddin, Baroness Uddin">
<text>Manzila Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin (; born 17 July 1959) is a British non-affiliated life peer and community activist of Bangladeshi descent. In 2009 she was included on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Muslim Women Power List for Britain. She previously sat for Labour when, in 2012, Uddin was required to repay £125,349, the largest amount in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal.

==Early life==
Manzila Pola Khan was born on 17 July 1959 to a Bengali Muslim Khan family from Rajshahi, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). She moved with her parents to the United Kingdom in 1973, when she was 13 years of age, and she grew up in East London. She attended the Plashet School in East Ham and was educated at the University of North London, where she earned a degree in social work.

==Political career==
Uddin started her professional career by creating and leading community working groups in the late 1970s. In 1980, she started working as a Youth and Community worker with the YWCA, and then a Liaison Officer for Tower Hamlets Social Services, and Manager of Tower Hamlets Women&#x27;s Health Project. She then began working for Newham social services in 1988. In 1990, Uddin was elected a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the first Bengali woman to hold such an office of a local authority in the United Kingdom. She was the Deputy Leader of Tower Hamlets council from 1994 to 1996.

In 1997, she applied to be the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency but did not reach the shortlist. Appointed a Labour &quot;working peer&quot; by Tony Blair, she was raised to the peerage, at the age of 39, as Baroness Uddin, of Bethnal Green in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, for life by Letters patent in the afternoon of 18 July 1998, at the House of Lords. She was the youngest woman on the benches and the only Muslim and Asian woman to be appointed to the House of Lords. She was invited to the House of Lords for her contribution to the advancement of women and disability rights, swearing in by saying &quot;Almighty Allah&quot; as she took her seat in the parliament. Since entering the House of Lords she has supported a handful of initiatives.

Uddin has been long campaigning for the increase of skills of Asian women living in Britain. She helped found the first purpose-built education and training centre for Asian women in the UK called the Jagonari Centre, located at Whitechapel, East London, in 1987. Uddin is a member of the EOP Implementation Committee, and a trustee of St Katherine&#x27;s and Shadwell Trust.

In 2005, she was selected by Blair to be part of a delegation to tackle Islamic extremism. However, in August 2006, Uddin was a signatory to an open letter to Blair criticising the UK&#x27;s foreign policy. It was an open letter criticising the government&#x27;s stance on the Middle East. It was signed by three Muslim MPs (which included Sadiq Khan and Mohammed Sarwar), three peers and 38 community groups. The letter was criticised by the then Foreign Office minister, Kim Howells who criticised Muslim leaders for condemning British foreign policy. In 2008, she was made the chairwoman of the ethnic minority women&#x27;s taskforce.

In 2009, Uddin was nominated for the shortlist of female Peer of the Year at the Women in Public Life Awards though was ultimately unsuccessful.

In 2010, the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party suspended Uddin indefinitely from the party in light of the expenses claim allegations. In 2019, a Labour Party spokesperson stated that Uddin was a member of the Labour Party.

In October 2010, under the recommendation of The Privileges and Conduct Committee of The House of Lords a suspension is to be handed down to Pola Uddin until Easter 2012 at the earliest for claiming expenses &quot;to which she was not entitled&quot;. The committee also acknowledged a repayment agreement for expenses wrongly claimed.

In December 2019, Uddin campaigned for the successful Labour Party candidate for Poplar and Limehouse, Apsana Begum, during the 2019 General Election.

Uddin is Treasurer of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for International Students, and Chair of the APPG on the Metaverse and Web 3.0.

=== Expenses scandal===

In May 2009, an article by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Insight team alleged that Uddin submitted House of Lords Expenses for a flat in Maidstone, Kent as her main residence. The article alleged Uddin claimed £30,000 per annum of tax-free expenses since purchasing the flat in 2005, and since 2001 on an unnamed residence outside London. The flat purchase was said to be connected with her to claim for second home allowance on her existing London property, a scheme that ostensibly exists to compensate politicians living outside London for the cost of accommodation close to Parliament. Residents living near the flat in Maidstone reportedly said they had not seen any occupiers in the flat since Uddin purchased it and that it had remained completely unfurnished until 2009, but Uddin claims: &quot;The Maidstone property is furnished and I strongly deny that I have never lived there&quot;. Uddin&#x27;s husband even denied having a property in Kent when questioned on the issue by the &quot;Times&quot;, and she appeared on the electoral roll at her London address from 1996 to date. Additionally, her Facebook page states how she has lived in the East End of London for over 30 years.

Uddin claimed a total of £29,675 for accommodation in 2007–08, a time when the maximum daily accommodation claim was £165 a day. This represents a claim at the maximum possible rate for 179 days, more days than the Lords actually sat that year.

Scottish National Party MP Angus Robertson called for an investigation on the report to the House of Lords authorities and the police. Uddin said, &quot;I do not believe that I have done anything wrong or breached any House of Lords rules.&quot; She stated &quot;I strongly deny that I have never lived there. Indeed I have stayed there regularly since buying it&quot;.

Uddin claimed her main home had been outside London since 2001, earning an extra £83,000 as a result. Despite repeated questioning she has refused to state the location and details of her main home between 2001 and 2005 for which expenses were also claimed. In January 2010 &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper revealed the property she had claimed for during this period was owned and occupied by her brother and his family, with Uddin&#x27;s sister-in-law stating she couldn&#x27;t recollect the Peer ever living there. She also has one of the highest claims for overnight subsistence of any member of the Lords.

Uddin&#x27;s home in Wapping, where she lives and is registered to vote, is a housing association property. Spitalfields Housing Association received a public subsidy of £37.8 million in 2008. The average rent for its properties is £104 a week, a sixth of the market rate. The allegations of fraud led the Conservative opposition leader in Tower Hamlets, Peter Golds, to state, &quot;Lady Uddin is depriving a low-income family of a home which was built for the needy at public expense&quot;.

On 5 May 2009, one of the senior Lord&#x27;s officials, Clerk of the Parliaments, announced that the House of Lords authorities would investigate the report by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. Uddin welcomed the investigation: &quot;I welcome this review and will co-operate fully with him in the hope of a speedy resolution and clarity that I did not break the rules of the House.&quot;

On 23 November 2009, Uddin&#x27;s cases were passed to the police for possible prosecution for fraud. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; later reported that she was refusing to co-operate with the police investigation, refusing to answer any questions.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced on 10 March 2010 that Baroness Uddin would not face any charges on the grounds that a senior parliamentary official ruled that a peer&#x27;s &quot;main house&quot; might be a place they visit only once a month. There were no indications that the expenses would be paid back.

On 18 October 2010, the House of Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee ruled that Baroness Uddin had &#x27;acted in bad faith&#x27; and recommended that she should be asked to repay £125,349 as well as being suspended from Parliament until Easter 2012. Lord Alli lent Uddin £62,000 to help her repay the expenses.

On 21 October 2010 the House of Lords voted to accept the committee&#x27;s recommendations. However, in November 2011, it was revealed that no formal mechanism existed to prevent Baroness Uddin&#x27;s return to the House of Lords, even if she refused to repay the expenses that were fraudulently claimed, leading many members of her own party to call for her to resign rather than bring the House of Lords into further disrepute.

In December 2011 the House Committee in the Lords recommended that Uddin and Lord Hanningfield should not be allowed back to the Lords until the outstanding expenses had been repaid. The money was repaid in 2012 with the help of £124,000 of loans from friends, and she returned to membership of the House of Lords in May 2012.

The amount of money Uddin was required to repay, £125,349, was the largest amount of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal.

===Bangladesh mansion===
Further expenses claims by Uddin were later discovered when &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; revealed that she owns a mansion in Bangladesh. The mansion was described as made out of Italian marble with tiles, mosaics and with a balcony. The mansion was believed to have been built after Uddin became a peer in 1998, costing £140,000 which was organised by her husband Komar, located in Jawa Bazar in Chhatak; this is where many of her in-laws are originally from. However, Uddin claims that the land was bought by her husband&#x27;s family, purchased by Komar&#x27;s father in 1980.

==Nomination==
In January 2013, Uddin was nominated for the Muslim Woman of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards but did not win.

==Personal life==
Uddin is married to Komar Uddin; his family is originally from Chhatak, Sunamganj District. Together they have four sons and one daughter.

<doc id="471008" wikidata="Q3259355" url="?curid=471008" title="Loral Space &amp; Communications">
<text>Loral Space &amp; Communications Inc. is a Delaware-domiciled satellite communications company headed by Michael B. Targoff. The company was formed in 1996 from the remnants of Loral Corporation when Loral divested its defense electronics and system integration businesses to Lockheed Martin for $9.1 billion. In 2006, Bernard L. Schwartz retired after leading the company for 34 years.

Loral presently has an investment in Telesat Canada in partnership with the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada, and merged into a new stock offering (TSAT) on the Nasdaq in November, 2020. The company also participates in a number of international and domestic joint ventures, including an ownership stake in XTAR.

==History==
On March 20, 1998, Loral completed the acquisition of Orion Network Systems, Inc., through the exchange of common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $479 million.

In January 2002, Loral reached a settlement with the U.S. Government in a case relating to the company’s involvement in the disclosure of information during a review of a Chinese rocket launch failure in 1996. Loral agreed to pay a civil fine of $14 million to the State Department without admitting or denying the government’s charges. According to a House Select Committee, Loral under CEO Schwartz provided the Chinese government with advice regarding a guidance system for future PRC road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Defense Technology Security Administration concluded Loral &quot;committed a serious export control violation&quot; and that the &quot;significant benefits derived by China from these activities are likely to lead to improvements in the overall reliability of their launch vehicles [i.e., rockets] and ballistic missiles and in particular their guidance systems.&quot; Loral paid a total fine of $20 million, the largest that a company has ever paid under the Arms Export Control Act.

On July 15, 2003, Loral and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In conjunction with the filing, Loral announced the sale of its North American satellite fleet to Intelsat to help reduce its debt. Loral emerged from Chapter 11 on November 21, 2005.

On Feb 1, 2006, a subsidiary of Loral Space &amp; Communications (Loral Skynet) began the construction of Telstar 11N, a powerful new multi-region Ku-band communications satellite.

On October 5, 2007, Loral Space &amp; Communications Inc. and the Public Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007. Loral hold a 64% economic interest and a 33% voting interest in Telesat Holdco, the ultimate parent company of the resulting new entity.

At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space &amp; Communications. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

On November 2, 2012, Loral Space &amp; Communications Inc. announced the sale of subsidiary Space Systems/Loral (SS/L), to MacDonald Dettwiler.

<doc id="471009" wikidata="Q2516953" url="?curid=471009" title="Quiff">
<text>The quiff is a hairstyle that combines the 1950s pompadour hairstyle, the 1950s flattop, and sometimes a mohawk. It was born as a post-war reaction to the short and strict haircuts for men. The hairstyle was a staple in the British Teddy Boy movement, but became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s and experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s.

==Origin==
The etymology of the word &quot;quiff&quot; is uncertain, several proposals have been suggested for its origin. It may owe its origin to the French word &quot;coiffe&quot;, which can mean either a hairstyle or, going further back, the mail that knights wore over their heads and under their helmets. Another possible candidate for its origin is the Dutch word &quot;kuif&quot;, meaning &quot;crest&quot;. The Dutch name for Tintin, who sports a quiff, is &quot;Kuifje&quot;, which is the diminutive of the same word.

==Styles==
The modern-day quiff includes longer hair at the front of the head, receding into shorter hair at the back with a trimmed back and sides. The Japanese punch perm, a favorite among yakuza (organized criminals) and bōsōzoku (biker gangs), is similar to the quiff.

<text>Viscount Hardinge, of Lahore and of Kings Newton in the County of Derby, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1846 for the soldier and Tory politician Sir Henry Hardinge. His son, the second Viscount, represented Downpatrick in Parliament. His great-great-grandson, the sixth Viscount, succeeded a distant relative as eighth Baronet, of Belle Isle in the County of Fermanagh, in 1986. This title had been created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom 1801 for Richard Hardinge. He was the third son of Nicolas Hardinge, younger brother of Reverend Henry Hardinge and uncle of the latter&#x27;s third son Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge. The baronetcy was created with special remainder to the heirs male of Richard Hardinge&#x27;s father.

Another member of the Hardinge family was the diplomat Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst. He was the second son of the second Viscount Hardinge. George Nicholas Hardinge was an officer of the Royal Navy, second son of Reverend Henry Hardinge and elder brother of the first Viscount.

The family seat is Broadmere House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire.

<doc id="471011" wikidata="Q125138" url="?curid=471011" title="Queens–Midtown Tunnel">
<text>The Queens–Midtown Tunnel (often referred to as the Midtown Tunnel) is a vehicular tunnel under the East River in New York City, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The tunnel consists of a pair of tubes, each carrying two lanes. The west end of the tunnel is located on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan, while the east end of the tunnel is located in Long Island City in Queens. Interstate 495 (I-495) runs the entire length of the tunnel; I-495&#x27;s western terminus is at the Manhattan portal of the tunnel.

The Queens–Midtown Tunnel was first planned in 1921, though the plans for the tunnel were modified over the following years. By the 1930s, the tunnel was being proposed as the Triborough Tunnel, which would connect Queens and Brooklyn with the east and west sides of Manhattan. The New York City Tunnel Authority finally started construction on the tunnel in 1936, although by then, the plans had been downsized to a connector between Queens and the east side of Manhattan. The tunnel, designed by Ole Singstad, was opened to traffic on November 15, 1940.

The Queens–Midtown Tunnel is owned by New York City and operated by MTA Bridges and Tunnels, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It is used by several dozen express bus routes. From 1981 to 2016, the Queens–Midtown Tunnel was also the site of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Animal Walk.

==Description==
The Queens–Midtown Tunnel consists of two tubes that each carry two traffic lanes. The southern tube normally carries eastbound traffic to Queens, and the northern tube normally carries westbound traffic to Manhattan. During the morning rush hour, one lane in the southern tube is used as a westbound high-occupancy vehicle lane. The northern tube is slightly longer than the southern tube. Although the tubes&#x27; portals in Queens are located side by side, the Manhattan portals are slightly offset from each other.

===Route===
The Queens–Midtown Tunnel&#x27;s eastern end is in Long Island City, where the Interstate 495 (I-495) descends from a viaduct into the tunnel. A toll plaza was formerly located here. Exits 13 and 14 for I-495 are located just east of the former toll plaza. Exit 13 is located right underneath the Pulaski Bridge and contains an eastbound-only exit and entrance to and from Borden Avenue. Exit 14, located immediately east of exit 13, contains an eastbound exit and westbound entrance to the tunnel from New York State Route 25A (21st Street). Eastbound traffic entering from Exit 13 intersects with traffic exiting to Exit 14, which must stop and yield to each other. Westbound traffic entering from Exit 14 can enter the tunnel from either 21st Street or 50th Avenue; there is no westbound exit. Although exits 13 and 14 are sequential exit numbers on I-495, they are actually the first and second numbered exits on I-495. The exits from the Manhattan side are not numbered.

The tubes travel under the East River until they are directly below 42nd Street on the Manhattan side, then curve south under First Avenue. The tubes then turn west between 36th and 37th Streets.

Both tubes surface east of Second Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The westbound roadway passes underneath Second Avenue and continues west for a half-block, where it splits into three exit ramps. One ramp continues westbound to 37th Street, while the other two connect to &quot;Tunnel Exit Street&quot;, which runs south to 34th Street and north to 41st Street. The northernmost block of Tunnel Exit Street, between 40th and 41st Streets, was sold to private interests in 1961 but continues to be in public use. The southern tube rises to ground level east of Second Avenue, where it is fed by eastbound traffic on 36th Street, as well as by entrance ramps from the north and south. These entrance ramps, collectively referred to as &quot;Tunnel Approach Street&quot;, run between Second and First Avenues from 34th Street to 40th Street. Electronic toll gantries are located just outside the Manhattan portals.

The Manhattan side was originally also supposed to link with the proposed Mid-Manhattan Expressway and the East River (FDR) Drive, though neither connection was built. Additionally, the Queens side was to have connected to an expressway that would have reached to the Rockaway Peninsula.

===Route designation===
The tunnel was once designated as part of New York State Route 24. In the mid-1940s, NY 24 was routed to follow the Crosstown Connecting Highway and the Queens–Midtown Expressway between Queens Boulevard in Woodside, Queens, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel. NY 24 continued through the tunnel and ended at First and Second Avenues in Manhattan, which at the time were designated as NY 1A. The Crosstown Connection Highway and the Midtown Highway were upgraded into the first portions of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (BQE) and the Queens Midtown Expressway, respectively, in the early 1950s. NY 24 was rerouted along the LIE between the Queens–Midtown Tunnel and Farmingdale, New York, in the late 1950s, and the designation was removed from the LIE altogether . The expressway and tunnel were designated as I-495 1960.

===Features===
The two tubes were built with an exterior diameter of , a roadway wide, and a maximum vehicular height limit of . , the vehicular height limit is , and the width limit is . The portals of each tube contain flood doors weighing and measuring thick, across, and tall.

The tunnel contains two ventilation buildings, one on each side of the East River. Both ventilation towers are orange brick structures in the Art Deco style. The tower on the Manhattan side is an octagon-shaped structure located on a city-owned block bounded by 41st and 42nd Streets, First Avenue, and the FDR Drive. This block is shared with the Robert Moses Playground, a playground operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), which was built along with the tunnel and opened in 1941. The Queens side&#x27;s ventilation building is a rectangular tower located in the center of Borden Avenue between Second and Fifth Streets. Due to its location in the middle of Borden Avenue, traffic along the road drives around the building. The two buildings originally contained a combined 23 fans, which were replaced in the mid-2000s. The ventilation system is capable of completely filtering the tubes&#x27; air within 90 seconds.

The Queens portal also abuts the small Bridge and Tunnel Park, which is bounded by the Pulaski Bridge on the west, 50th Avenue on the north, 11th Place on the east, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel entrance ramp on the south. The park opened in 1979, and is operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA; now MTA Bridges and Tunnels). NYC Parks owns the land that constitutes Bridge and Tunnel Park.

==History==

===Initial proposal===
The Queens–Midtown Tunnel was originally proposed in 1921 by Manhattan&#x27;s borough president, Julius Miller. The plan resurfaced in 1926 under the names Triborough Tunnel and alternatively 38th Street Tunnel. Miller, in conjunction with Queens&#x27; borough president, Maurice E. Connolly, proposed the $58 million tunnel as a connector from Midtown Manhattan to Long Island City in Queens, and to Greenpoint in Brooklyn. At the time, there was frequent and heavy congestion on bridges across the East River, which separated Manhattan from the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn on Long Island. Brooklyn borough president James J. Byrne expressed his displeasure at the fact that the Queens and Manhattan borough presidents had proposed the Triborough Tunnel without consulting him first. That December, Mayor James J. Walker formed a commission to study traffic congestion on New York City bridges and tunnels. Local civic groups felt that it would be inadequate to simply increase capacity on existing crossings like the Queensboro Bridge, since there were no roads connecting Long Island with Midtown Manhattan. The city ultimately declined to give its immediate support to the Triborough Tunnel proposal.

In April 1927, civic groups formed the 38th Street Tunnel Committee to advocate for the tunnel. The groups stated that the tunnel would act as a relief corridor for traffic from midtown Manhattan, which at the time had to use other crossings to the north or south. That June, the city voted to allocate $100,000 toward surveying sites and making test bores. Following news of this allotment, several more civic groups expressed support for the tunnel and urged that it be completed as soon as possible. By February 1929, thirty-five civic groups supported the construction of the tunnel.

Simultaneously, civic groups proposed a system of tunnels under Manhattan, connecting Queens in the east with Weehawken, New Jersey, in the west. The groups proposed that the Queens–Midtown Tunnel connect with the Midtown Hudson (Lincoln) Tunnel, which would cross the Hudson River and continue westward to New Jersey. The planned tunnel would originate at 10th Avenue on Manhattan&#x27;s west side, run underneath Manhattan streets and the East River, and surface near Borden Avenue at the Long Island City side. The tunnel would contain exits to Oakland Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as well as to Third Avenue in Manhattan. The Fifth Avenue Association further proposed that the city create a bridge-and-tunnel authority to would raise funding and oversee construction and operations. The proposed agency would be similar to the Port of New York Authority, which was constructing and operating Hudson River crossings.

===Approval===

The Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York formally endorsed a Queens–Manhattan crossing in January 1929, but stated that the crossing could be either a bridge or a tunnel. The city began conducting a study on the feasibility of constructing the Triborough Tunnel, as well as the Triborough Bridge between Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx. The study&#x27;s authors suggested that the city construct a network of parkways and expressways, including a major highway leading from Long Island to the Manhattan-Queens tunnel. The Queens Planning Commission also recommended the construction of the Triborough Tunnel. An official plan for the Triborough Tunnel was released that June. The plan outlined an $86 million system of feeder highways, including the crosstown Manhattan tunnel and the tunnel spur from Brooklyn. The New York City Board of Estimate approved the use of tolls for the tunnel, which would be used toward tunnel maintenance and create revenue for the city. Subsequently, officials expected that tunnel construction could start by the end of that year.

In July 1929, the city was faced with unexpected legal issues. The language of Walker&#x27;s proclamation ostensibly allowed construction to proceed, but in doing so, tasked the wrong city agency with constructing the Triborough Tunnel. Civic groups convened a special session in which they asked the New York City Board of Estimate to override the laws so the tunnel could be approved. The Board of Estimate ultimately allotted $5 million toward feasibility studies and preliminary construction for the Manhattan–Queens tunnel, as well as another tunnel under the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island. Afterward, the New York City Board of Transportation hurried to submit plans for the Triborough Tunnel&#x27;s construction.
In January 1930, after the Midtown Hudson Tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey was approved, engineers initiated a study to examine a possible connection with the Triborough Tunnel. Around this time, engineers revised the Triborough Tunnel&#x27;s eastern approaches, moving the route of the Brooklyn spur from 11th to 21st Street. Exploratory borings were reportedly completed by June 1930. Three months later, the Board of Transportation modified the plans for the tunnel on the Manhattan side. The new plans included a &quot;mixing plaza&quot; at Second Avenue in Manhattan, where the tubes from Queens and from Manhattan&#x27;s west side would rise to ground level. The eastbound and westbound tubes would respectively run under 37th and 38th Streets, since the streets were too narrow to accommodate two tubes side-by-side. Advocates of the Triborough Tunnel opposed the construction of surface-level exit plazas, saying that the mixing plaza would force motorists to briefly drive along the narrow side streets. One group proposed a crosstown elevated highway in lieu of a tunnel under Manhattan.

In December 1930, the United States Department of War approved the construction of the Triborough Tunnel, since the tube would not hinder maritime navigation during wartime. Even with this approval, the Board of Transportation had delayed construction by several months because of significant public concerns about the crosstown-highway section. In June 1931, the Board of Transportation submitted a detailed revised plan for the Triborough Tunnel to the Board of Estimate. The project was now expected to cost $93.6 million, including the $23.5 million alignment under the East River and within Queens. That October, the Board of Estimate allocated $200,000 for planning. It was expected that construction would start in March 1932 and the East River segment would be complete by 1936. By July 1932, no contracts had been awarded because of a lack of funding, and the tunnel&#x27;s cost had increased to $80 million. As the Midtown Tunnel plan faltered, the Board of Estimate approved the construction of other projects that had not been as extensively studied.

===Plans revived===
In May 1935, Governor Herbert H. Lehman signed a bill that authorized the creation of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel Authority to construct the tunnel. Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia subsequently nominated three prominent businessmen to head the agency. La Guardia supported the immediate construction of the tunnel because he believed it would help traffic get from Manhattan to the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Queens. The Queens–Midtown Tunnel Authority applied for a federal loan and grant, worth a combined $58.4 million, from the Public Works Administration (PWA) that September. Two months later, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) offered to lend $47.1 million of the tunnel&#x27;s cost if the PWA granted the remaining $11.3 million balance. In response to the RFC&#x27;s offer, PWA chairman Harold L. Ickes stated that his agency had $32.7 million readily available for the construction of the tunnel. The tunnel&#x27;s projected $58.4 million cost only applied to the section of the tunnel under the river, as well as the Queens approach and the Manhattan approach east of Second Avenue. The Brooklyn spur had been canceled for the time being because it could not be funded independently, while the crosstown highway was to be included in a later project. Civic groups continued to advocate for the canceled Brooklyn spur even after construction started.

The federal government tentatively allocated $58.3 million for the tunnel&#x27;s construction in January 1936. The allotment was composed of the RFC loan and PWA grant, and it was expected to be paid off by revenue from tolls and bonds. The same month, the New York State Legislature organized the New York City Tunnel Authority to construct the Queens–Midtown and Brooklyn–Battery Tunnels. Work on the Queens–Midtown Tunnel could start as soon as the city received the federal funds. The Tunnel Authority accepted the grant in March 1936, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel became the United States&#x27; largest public works project that was not supervised by a federal agency.

In April 1936, Manhattan borough president Samuel Levy suggested that a six-lane bridge should be built instead, since a bridge would save an estimated $36 million compared to the tunnel. This plan was endorsed by Brooklyn borough president Raymond V. Ingersoll and State Senator Thomas C. Desmond. Robert Moses, the chairman of the Triborough Bridge Authority (TBA), also supported a bridge, but for a separate reason: he held a grudge against the Tunnel Authority because he had been rejected from running the authority. Moses&#x27;s agency would be the only entity who could construct and operate a toll bridge entirely within the New York City limits, and the already-approved federal funding for the tunnel would be canceled if the project was delayed too long. New York City Tunnel Authority commissioner William Friedman, Mayor LaGuardia, and the Queens Borough Chamber of Commerce opposed a bridge, since the funding for the tunnel had already been secured. In spite of the bridge dispute, the PWA ordered that tunnel planning work proceed. A bill for the proposed bridge was voted down in the New York State Senate that May.

===Construction===

The Tunnel Authority approved plans for the Queens–Midtown Tunnel in August 1936, and the Authority&#x27;s chief engineer, Ole Singstad, was tasked with the project&#x27;s design. By the end of the month, the first bids for the tunnel were advertised. A groundbreaking ceremony for the tunnel was held on the Queens side on October 1, 1936, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in attendance. Shortly afterward, the New York City Tunnel Authority awarded the first contracts for the tunnel&#x27;s construction. Test bores for the tubes were started later that month. These exploratory bores utilized diamond-tipped drills operated from flat-bottomed boats, which drilled downward into the riverbed.

After the test bores were completed in November 1936, engineers determined that there were many geological and manmade obstacles to constructing the tunnel. First, the Queens–Midtown Tunnel&#x27;s path passed through a large concentration of solid rock, although there were also some pockets of dirt under the river that would be easy to dig through. Additionally, sandhogs digging the Queens–Midtown Tunnel would have to avoid accidental damage to the East River railroad tunnels to the south and the Steinway Tunnel to the north. Of the four shafts that were being constructed for the tunnel, only the Queens construction shaft had been completed. The next month, the Tunnel Authority had accepted a bid for the Midtown ventilation shaft, and it had been authorized to begin the shaft&#x27;s construction immediately. Construction on the Manhattan ventilation shaft began with a ceremony on December 31, 1936, and four months later, the city bought the entire city block surrounding the shaft was located.

The first $500,000 allocation of PWA funding was released in January 1937. A layer of clay was placed at the bottom of the East River, atop the tunnel&#x27;s path, to prevent air leakages and to maintain air pressure within the tubes. This &quot;blanket&quot; contained about of clay. This was the first time a clay blanket was used on an underwater tunnel project, so digging work was delayed for four months to allow the clay layer to be placed. Officials feared that the tunnel might not open before the end of 1940, as was originally planned. A contract for digging the tubes themselves was awarded in June 1937. The project employed as many as 2,500 sandhogs at a time. Because the work site had such a high air pressure, each man worked two 30-minute shifts per day, punctuated by a 6-hour break in a depressurized chamber so that they would not get decompression sickness.

On the Queens side, it was proposed to link the tunnel to what is now I-495. Eventually, officials agreed to construct the link to what is now the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, forming part of a longer highway that connected directly to LaGuardia Airport. The status of a corresponding limited-access expressway on the Manhattan side, connecting to the Lincoln Tunnel, was still undecided. The Manhattan entrance and exit ramps eliminated the St. Gabriel Church, which was later replaced by construction of the Church of Our Saviour on Park Avenue. By early 1938, costs were rising quickly, and only 65% of the contracts had been awarded. Tunnel Authority Commissioner Friedman stated that if costs were to keep increasing at the same rate, construction might have to be abandoned midway through. By September 1938, three-fourths of the tunnel&#x27;s contracts had been awarded.

Work on the underwater section of the tubes started in April 1938. Underwater boring was supposed to have started earlier but the geology of the underwater section had delayed construction. When the underwater digging started, La Guardia opened the valves that allowed compressed air to flow into the tubes, and workers started digging the tunnels under the river from each end. The pressurized air allowed sandhogs to work as much as six hours per day in two 3-hour shifts, but as they tunneled nearer to the center of the river, the pressure increased and sandhogs worked fewer hours per day. Builders also pumped air along the top of the tunnel to prevent water from seeping in. Later, workers began wearing oxygen masks connected to a portable machine that gave out pure oxygen. Despite the precautions taken to avoid sudden depressurization of the tubes, about 300 cases of decompression sickness were recorded during the construction process.

The project was about 25% completed by September 1938. Workers primarily dug underwater using tunnelling shields that drilled inward from both portals of each tube, but used dynamite to blast through thick sheets of rock. Afterward, steel rings, each composed of 14 sections which individually weighed up to , were laid within the tunnel. In March 1939, the PWA released a report predicting that the tunnel would not be complete until summer 1941, eight months later than originally planned, due to geological difficulties. Around the same time, Robert Moses alleged that the Queens–Midtown Tunnel would not be profitable, during an unrelated argument about the feasibility of building the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. This prompted the New York State Legislature to conduct an investigation into the Queens–Midtown Tunnel&#x27;s costs. Moses&#x27;s allegation also originated from his resentment toward the Tunnel Authority.

Work proceeded quickly afterward, and the tunnel was 60% complete by May 1939. Construction was briefly halted in July when sandhogs went on strike for two weeks due to a disagreement between two unions. By that time, the two segments of the tubes were only separated by . Workers digging from the Manhattan side no longer required compressed air because the tubes had reached a rock cropping. The sandhogs sped up their pace of digging, and by late September, the project was 45 days ahead of schedule.

The disjointed segments of both tubes were connected with a &quot;holing through&quot; ceremony in November 1939, with a margin of error of less than . In January 1940, another construction milestone was reached when the last of 1,622 metal rings were installed in the tubes. The fans were being installed in the ventilation buildings, and property at the Queens portal was being demolished to make way for the tunnel approaches. By May 1940, only three contracts remained to be awarded, and the tunnel was 90% complete.

===Opening and early years===

The Queens–Midtown Tunnel finished on schedule in late 1940. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through the tunnel, on October 28, 1940. The general public could not use it until mid-November. An advertisement for the tunnel, published in newspapers just before its opening, touted it as &quot;the toll that isn&#x27;t a toll&quot; with the slogan &quot;Cross In 3 Minutes, Save In 3 Ways ... Time! Money! Gas!&quot; The Queens Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s president praised the Queens–Midtown Tunnel as something that would spur development in Queens.

The tunnel was opened to the general public on November 15, 1940, at a ceremony on the Queens side. The attendees included the Queens and Manhattan borough presidents; U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner; and New York City Council president Newbold Morris, who was attending in La Guardia&#x27;s stead. The tubes were fitted with a then-new lighting technology that allowed drivers to more quickly adjust to the sunlight upon leaving the tunnel. One hundred and fifty workers were hired and trained to operate the tunnel. The first paying customer was Henry Sokovit of Queens.

In a report published in August 1939, the New York City Tunnel Authority had estimated that the tunnel would carry 10 million vehicles in its first year and would reach its 16-million annual-vehicle capacity by 1952. Against expectation, traffic counts in the first few months were lower than expected because motorists could use the East River bridges to the north and south for free. The tunnel had carried one million vehicles by February 1941, three months after opening. This was further exacerbated by the gasoline rationing during World War II, which caused vehicular trips in general to decline. The tunnel was closed during the nighttime beginning in February 1943, but due to growing nighttime traffic demand, 24-hour operation resumed in July 1944. By 1946, the tunnel was running a $5.8 million deficit. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the successor to the New York City Tunnel Authority, recorded a 72% increase in tunnel traffic in the first half of that year compared to the same time frame in 1945. The tunnel recorded its first profits in 1949, with a net earning of $659,505. As part of an experiment to alleviate traffic congestion, in December 1955, one of the eastbound tube&#x27;s lanes began carrying westbound traffic during morning rush hours.

In 1950, the TBTA and several airlines agreed to build the East Side Airline Terminal at First Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets, on the Manhattan side of the tunnel. When the terminal opened in 1953, it accommodated bus routes that ran to either LaGuardia or John F. Kennedy International Airports. The terminal operated until 1984, and it was sold in 1985. This site is now occupied by The Corinthian, an apartment complex.

===Mid-Manhattan Expressway and third tube plan===
A connector between the Queens–Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels was again proposed in 1950, but was dropped for lack of support. Nine years later, Robert Moses proposed adding a third tube to the Queens–Midtown Tunnel to relieve congestion, with a possible extension to Brooklyn. The tube would be located to the south of the two existing tubes. In January 1965, Moses announced that money had been allocated to a feasibility study for the third tube, which was projected to cost $120 million. This proposal was part of his plan to build a Mid-Manhattan expressway over 30th Street. The third tube was to connect to the ultimately unbuilt Bushwick Expressway, which would have run across northeastern Brooklyn and southwestern Queens before intersecting with the present-day Nassau Expressway.

In December 1965, Moses canceled his plans for the Mid-Manhattan Expressway due to opposition from the city government. He affirmed that the TBTA would construct a third tube for the Queens–Midtown Tunnel because it did not require the city&#x27;s approval, and he stated that the new tube could be completed four-and-a-half years after construction started. According to Moses, after the third tube was completed, two tubes would be dedicated exclusively to westbound and eastbound traffic, while the center tube would become a reversible-flow roadway. The Queens Chamber of Commerce supported the third-tube project, but citywide officials opposed it. Moses ignored the city&#x27;s disapproval and, in March 1966, advertised for bids to make test borings for the third tube. The TBTA continued studying the feasibility of a third tube through 1967, but ultimately, a third tube was never built.

===Later years===
In 1971, one lane of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel&#x27;s eastbound tube was converted to a westbound high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) and bus lane during the morning rush hour. The reversible tunnel lane was fed by a HOV/bus lane along I-495, which started east of the tunnel&#x27;s Queens portal.

Each spring from 1981 to 2016, the tunnel was closed to traffic for a few hours overnight to accommodate the annual &quot;Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Animal Walk&quot;. Several nights before the circus opened at Madison Square Garden, the elephants marched into Manhattan and down 34th Street to the arena. The animals had formerly been transported into the city via the West Side railroad line in Manhattan, but the southernmost part of that line, the High Line viaduct, was closed in 1981 during construction of the Javits Center. The first &quot;Animal Walk&quot; through the Queens–Midtown Tunnel memorialized a similar event ten years earlier, when the animals had walked to Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel due to a railroad strike. The walk became an annual tradition, and crowds of several hundred people would gather at the Queens–Midtown Tunnel&#x27;s Queens portal to see the march in the middle of the night. Even so, the march was controversial and attracted protests from organizations who opposed what they saw as the inhumane treatment of the circus animals. When the circus stopped using elephants in 2016, the elephant walk ceased.

Under an agreement with Verizon Wireless, the Queens–Midtown Tunnel received cellular service in 1995. The tubes&#x27; roadways were originally paved with bricks, but the road surface was replaced with asphalt in 1995. Two years later, the TBTA&#x27;s successor, MTA Bridges and Tunnels, announced its intention to renovate the roof of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel. The $132 million project, completed in May 2001, involved replacing the roof with 930 slabs of concrete that were suspended from brackets glued onto the tunnel shell. The major contract for the renovation project, worth $97 million, received scrutiny when it was discovered that the contractor had given money to the political party of Governor George Pataki just before the contract was awarded. A state judge found that the MTA did not break any laws or ethical obligations when it awarded the contract to the Pataki donor instead of another competitor. The MTA started replacing the 23 fans within the tunnel&#x27;s ventilation structures, in 2004 and the fan-replacement project was completed in 2008.

For a short time after the September 11 attacks in 2001, all Manhattan-bound traffic through the tunnel was subject to a high-occupancy vehicle restriction. This restriction was removed in April 2002.

In 2017–2018, the tiled walls in the Queens–Midtown and Brooklyn–Battery Tunnels were replaced due to damage suffered during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The re-tiled white walls have gold-and-blue stripes, representing the official state colors of New York. There was a controversy over the re-tiling of the tunnels, which cost a combined $30 million, because of the ongoing transit crisis at the time.

On September 4, 2024, a contractor conducting surveys for the East River Greenway accidentally drilled through the roof of one of the tubes, causing water to leak into the tunnel, and forcing it to be closed for emergency repairs. It was re-opened several hours later, after a temporary plug was put in place. Contractors later permanently fixed the leak by fitting a steel cap over that plug.

==Bus routes==
The tunnel carries 21 express bus routes; sixteen of these routes use the tunnel for westbound travel only. The bus routes that use the tunnel are the , all operated by the MTA Bus Company, and the , operated by MTA New York City Transit. All of these routes except the BM5, QM7, QM8, QM8 Super Express (SX), QM11, QM25, QM2 SX, QM5 SX, and QM20 SX use the tunnel for westbound travel only, as most of the routes use the Queensboro Bridge for eastbound travel.

==Tolls==

, drivers pay $11.19 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $6.94 per car or $3.02 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $8.36 per car or $3.57 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

Open-road cashless tolling started on January 10, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the tunnel. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore located on the Manhattan side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

===Historical tolls===
===Congestion toll===

Congestion pricing in New York City was implemented in January 2025; drivers who enter Manhattan via the tunnel pay a second toll. The congestion charges are collected via E-ZPass and tolls-by-mail. The charges vary based on time of day and vehicle class, but the congestion toll is charged once per day. Drivers who use the Queens–Midtown Tunnel to enter the congestion zone will receive a credit toward the congestion charge during the day, and they would pay a discounted toll at night.

<text>Viscount Hampden is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain when the diplomat and politician Robert Hampden, 4th Baron Trevor, was created Viscount Hampden, of Great and Little Hampden in the County of Bedford on 14 June 1776. The title of Baron Trevor, of Bromham, had been created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1712 for his father, the lawyer Sir Thomas Trevor. Both titles became extinct in 1824 on the death of the first Viscount&#x27;s second son, the third Viscount.

The viscountcy was revived in the Peerage of the United Kingdom when the Liberal politician and former Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Henry Brand, was created Viscount Hampden, of Glynde in the County of Sussex on 4 March 1884. Brand was the second son of Henry Trevor, 21st Baron Dacre and in 1890 he succeeded his elder brother as the twenty-third Baron Dacre. His son, the second Viscount, represented Hertfordshire and Stroud in Parliament and served as Governor of New South Wales. On the death in 1965 of his grandson, the fourth Viscount, the barony of Dacre fell into abeyance between the late Viscount&#x27;s daughters Rachel Leila Brand and Tessa Mary Brand (the abeyance was terminated in 1970 in favour of Rachel Leila Brand; see the Baron Dacre for more information). The viscountcy passed to the Viscount&#x27;s younger brother, the fifth Viscount. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the sixth Viscount.

Several other members of the Brand family have also gained distinction. Thomas Seymour Brand (1847–1916), second son of the first Viscount, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. Arthur Brand, third son of the first Viscount, was a Liberal politician. Sir Hubert George Brand (1870–1955), second son of the second Viscount, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Robert Brand, fourth son of the second Viscount, was a civil servant and was created Baron Brand in 1946. Roger Brand (1880–1945), fifth son of the second Viscount, was a brigadier-general in the Army. And also the 3rd Viscount gained rank and title in a similar fashion and was involved in the sport polo.

Both Robert Hampden, 1st Viscount Hampden and Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden were descendants in the female line of John Hampden, the patriot, hence their choice of title.

The family seat is Glynde Place, near Lewes, Sussex.

<doc id="471015" wikidata="Q1253530" url="?curid=471015" title="Doxygen">
<text>Doxygen ( ) is a documentation generator that works with many programming languages. It extracts information from specially-formatted source code comments and saves the information in one of various supported formats.

Doxygen supports static analysis of a codebase. It uses the parse tree parsed from the codebase to generate diagrams and charts of the code structure. It provides cross-referencing that a reader can use to refer back to the source code from the generated documentation.

Doxygen can be used in many programming contexts. It supports many languages including C, C++, C#, D, Fortran, IDL, Java, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, and VHDL. It can run on many computers, including Unix-like, macOS, and Windows systems. It is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version2 (GPLv2).

== History ==

The first version of Doxygen borrowed code from an early version of DOC++, developed by Roland Wunderling and Malte Zöckler at Zuse Institute Berlin. Later, the Doxygen code was rewritten by Dimitri van Heesch.

== Development ==

The Doxygen source code is hosted at GitHub, where the main developer, Dimitri van Heesch, contributes under the name &quot;doxygen&quot;. Doxygen is written in C++, and consists of around 300,000 source lines of code. For lexical analysis, Lex (or its replacement Flex) is run via approximately 35,000 lines of lex script. The parsing tool Yacc (or its replacement Bison) is also used, but only for minor tasks. The bulk of parsing is done via native C++ code. The build system includes CMake and Python script.

== Design ==

Like other documentation generators such as Javadoc, Doxygen extracts information from both the comment and the symbolic (non-comment) code. A comment is associated with a programming symbol by immediately preceding it in the code. Markup in the comments allows for controlling inclusion and formatting of the resulting documentation.

Doxygen supports output in many formats including: HTML, CHM, RTF, PDF, LaTeX, PostScript and man page. 

Doxygen can generate inheritance diagrams for C++ classes. For more advanced diagrams and graphs, Doxygen can use the &quot;dot&quot; tool from Graphviz.

== Example ==

All examples are given for languages with C-like comments where a multi-line comment starts with codice_1 and a single line comment starts with codice_2.

Doxygen ignores a comment unless it is marked specially. For a multi-line comment, the comment must start with codice_3 or codice_4. A markup tag is prefixed with a backslash (codice_5) or an at-sign (codice_6). The following is a relatively simple function comment block with markup in bold:
 &quot;Function description&quot;
 @param &quot;p1 Parameter description&quot;
 @param &quot;p2 Parameter description&quot;
 @return &quot;Return description&quot;
 void foo(int p1, int p2) {}

A block can be formatted various ways. A common way is to left-align 
asterisks on each line which Doxygen does not include in the output. For example:
 * &quot;Function description&quot;
 * @param &quot;p1 Parameter description&quot;
 * @param &quot;p2 Parameter description&quot;
 * @return &quot;Return description&quot;
 void foo(int p1, int p2) {}

Alternatively, a block can consist of a series of single-line comments. Doxygen accepts comments with an additional slash (codice_7) or exclamation (codice_8).

 /// &quot;Function description&quot;
 /// @param &quot;p1 Parameter description&quot;
 /// @param &quot;p2 Parameter description&quot;
 /// @return &quot;Return description&quot;
 void foo(int p1, int p2) {}

To locate a documentation comment to the right of the code, an additional codice_9 marker is required. This allows for an alternative approach for documenting parameters as shown below.
 * &quot;Function description&quot;
 void foo(int p1 /**&lt;Parameter description*/, int p2 /**&lt;Parameter description*/) {}

A mathematic formula can be specified via LaTeX commands. For example:
/**
 * An inline equation @f$ e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 @f$
 * A displayed equation: @f[ e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 @f]


A more complete example in C++:

 * @file
 * @brief Time class header
 * @author John Doe &lt;jdoe@example.com&gt;
 * @version 1.0
 * @copyright CC BY-SA or GFDL
 * @sa &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights&quot;&gt;Wikipedia:Copyrights - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;

 * Represents a moment of time
 * @author John Doe
class Time {
public:
 * Construct with a duration since Jan 1, 1970
 * @param millis A number of milliseconds
 explicit Time(long millis) : m_millis(millis) {

 * Get a new instance with the current time
 * @return Instance
 static Time now() {
 }

private:
 long m_millis; ///&lt; Milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970
