<text>JSyn (&quot;Java Synthesis&quot;) is a free API for developing interactive sound applications in Java. Developed by Phil Burk and others, it is available on GitHub. JSyn has a flexible, unit generator-based synthesis and DSP architecture that allows developers to create synthesizers, audio playback routines, and effects processing algorithms within a Java framework that allows for easy integration with other Java routines (e.g. graphics, user interface, etc.).

Although fundamentally a synthesis language (imitative of if not directly inspired by Csound and other MUSIC-N languages), JSyn has a number of powerful extensions and ancillary libraries, including JMSL (a Java update to the HMSL music specification language) and JScore (a staff notation editor and library), which adds a significantly higher level of musical informatics to the package than would normally be supplied with a set of synthesis routines. Wire, a graphical editor for JSyn routines, also allows developers to create DSP chains using a simple GUI that gives the API some of the ease of use of programs such as Max/MSP.

<text>The Court Jester is a 1955 American historical musical comedy film starring Danny Kaye, Glynis Johns, Basil Rathbone, Angela Lansbury and Cecil Parker. The film was written, produced, and directed by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama for distribution by Paramount Pictures. It was released in Technicolor and the VistaVision widescreen format.

The film centers on Hubert Hawkins, a carnival entertainer. He is a member of the Black Fox&#x27;s band of rebels (a parody of Robin Hood and his Merry Men) who are protecting the true infant King of Medieval England from a usurper. Events cause Hawkins to take the identity of an apparent court jester, who is actually an assassin, so he can spy in the usurping King&#x27;s castle, where there are many people who wish to make use of the Jester for their own villainous ends. The film contains several songs (all sung by Kaye), makes heavy use of slapstick comedy and quick-witted wordplay, and is best remembered for the tongue twister &quot;The pellet with the poison&#x27;s in the vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true!&quot;

Though the film was not financially successful upon release, it has grown to be a beloved classic, earning high scores on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2004, &quot;The Court Jester&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

== Plot ==

King Roderick the Tyrant, having sent Lord Ravenhurst to slaughter the Royal Family of England, usurps the throne. The Black Fox and his band of rebels rescue the true king, an infant with the royal &quot;purple pimpernel&quot; birthmark on his backside. They harass Roderick and his men while guarding the baby. Lords Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee convince the king to seek alliance with Sir Griswold of MacElwain, by offering him Roderick&#x27;s daughter Gwendolyn in marriage. Gwendolyn objects, for the castle witch Griselda foretold a more gallant lover.

Hubert Hawkins, the Black Fox&#x27;s minstrel, brings a troupe of acrobat-midgets from the carnival to replace him so he can fight, but the Black Fox refuses. The King&#x27;s men find their hideout, so Hawkins and another rebel, Maid Jean, are ordered to disguise themselves as wine merchants and take the baby to safety. They meet the king&#x27;s newly hired jester, Giacomo, on the road. Jean knocks him out and tells Hawkins to steal his identity. Hawkins heads for the castle, and Jean travels on alone, but is captured by the king&#x27;s men, who were ordered to bring the fairest wenches to the king&#x27;s court.

Lord Ravenhurst tells a friend that Giacomo is actually an assassin whom he hired to kill Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee, to prevent the alliance. Simultaneously, Gwendolyn decides to kill Griselda for lying to her, until Griselda promises Giacomo as her prophesied lover. Hawkins, unaware of both these things, enters the castle and tries to make contact with a rebel confederate. However, Ravenhurst unwittingly appears at his whistle signal, so Hawkins allies himself with him instead. Prior to his arrival, Fergus the Hostler, the true confederate, already met up with Jean, and now has the baby hidden in a basket. Jean sneaks into the palace and steals a key to a secret passage from King Roderick&#x27;s chambers.

Hawkins is put under a hypnotic spell by Griselda, and in that state woos the princess, receives his orders to kill the three lords from Ravenhurst, and gets the key from Jean, but loses it back to the king. Hawkins forgets all this once the spell is gone. Fergus gives him the basket with the baby, but before he can get it to safety, Hawkins is called before the king. He distracts the king and crowd from noticing the basket with a well-received performance; Jean rescues the basket. Griselda, meanwhile, poisons the three lords&#x27; cups to prevent the alliance. Ravenhurst believes Hawkins killed them.

Griswold arrives, but Gwendolyn declares her love for &quot;Giacomo&quot;, and Hawkins is arrested and jailed. Ravenhurst learns that Giacomo never arrived and concludes that Hawkins, having apparently sabotaged the alliance, must be the Black Fox. He convinces Roderick to rush Hawkins through the trials to become a knight so he can duel Griswold, ostensibly so Griswold can kill the jester but really so the Black Fox would eliminate Griswold.

Jean steals back the key. Fergus sends it by pigeon to the real Black Fox, but is caught and tortured to death by Ravenhurst&#x27;s men. At the tournament, Griselda poisons one of the ceremonial drinks and tells Hawkins which. One of Griswold&#x27;s men overhears and warns Griswold, and he and Hawkins both struggle to remember which of the glasses is poisoned (the famous &quot;Vessel with the Pestle&quot; routine) and end up not drinking the toast. Through sheer luck, Hawkins defeats Griswold in the duel, but spares his life and sends him away.

Ravenhurst finds the baby and exposes Hawkins as a traitor. However, the real Black Fox sends the midgets through the secret passage, and they rescue Hawkins, Jean, and the baby. Jean clubs the gate guard and lets the Black Fox&#x27;s army into the castle. Threatened by Gwendolyn, Griselda hypnotizes Hawkins to become a master swordsman. He duels Ravenhurst, though the spell is accidentally switched on and off several times. In the end, Hawkins and Jean launch Ravenhurst from a catapult into the sea.

Griswold returns with his army ready to kill the rebels, but Hawkins shows him the infant&#x27;s purple pimpernel birthmark. Griswold kneels to the baby, as does everyone else, including Roderick. Hawkins leads everybody in song as the film ends.

==Musical score==

Hollywood arranger and composer Vic Schoen was asked to provide the musical score for the film. Film composer Elmer Bernstein was hired as the assistant musical director to Schoen. &quot;The Court Jester&quot; was an enormous challenge for Schoen at the time because it was his first feature film. He was not formally trained on the mechanisms of how music was synchronized to film – he learned on the job. The film required 100 minutes of music for Schoen to compose and arrange. Some pieces in the film (also known as &quot;cues&quot;) were very long, and took many hours for Schoen to finesse. One piece that Schoen was most proud of in his career was the chase music toward the end of the movie when Danny Kaye&#x27;s character engages in a sword fight. Schoen wrote a mini piano concerto for this scene.

A pleasant surprise happened during the recording session of &quot;The Court Jester&quot;. The red &quot;recording in progress&quot; light was illuminated to ensure no interruptions, so Schoen started to conduct a cue but noticed that the entire orchestra had turned to look at Igor Stravinsky, who had just walked into the studio. Schoen said, &quot;The entire room was astonished to see this short little man with a big chest walk in and listen to our session. I later talked with him after we were done recording. We went and got a cup of coffee together. After listening to my music Stravinsky told me &#x27;You have broken all the rules&#x27;. At the time I didn&#x27;t understand his comment because I had been self-taught. It took me years to figure out what he had meant.&quot;

However the producers removed this score and commissioned an entirely new one from Hollywood veteran Walter Scharf. He wrote a new score from scratch but because of lack of time, Scharf insisted he didn&#x27;t want a credit for his work.

The film&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Life Could Not Better Be&quot; breaks the fourth wall by having Kaye make direct reference to the filmmakers conducting “research”.

==Audio version==
In September 1955, Kaye recorded a nine-minute-long condensed version of &quot;The Court Jester&quot; for 1956 release by Decca Records on the two-part single K 166. In the simplified version of the storyline, the characters of Hubert and the Black Fox are merged, Lord Ravenhurst is replaced by an unnamed evil king, and Jean is dropped entirely. It features excerpts from several of the film&#x27;s songs (&quot;Outfox the Fox&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Dreaming&quot;, &quot;My Heart Knows a Lovely Song&quot;, and the finale version of &quot;Life Could Not Better Be&quot;).

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===

The &quot;New York Times&quot; was in many ways complimentary: &quot;No use to try to trace the story as it riotously unfolds. We vaguely suspect that proved too tiresome for even Messrs. Panama and Frank. There are all sorts of beautiful, babbling stretches of sheer obscurity along the way. But in every—or almost everymix-up, there is the all-things-to-all-men Mr.Kaye... this story does not have subtlety. Nor does Mr.Kaye&#x27;s portrayal in it have firm personality. He is just a funny fellow bounced all over the place, with surprisingly few songs to help him. The farce lacks finish—or even form. But Mr.Kaye plays it adroitly, and so do... Parker... Lansbury... Johns... Rathbone... and many, many more. The color and costuming are gaudy, and the whole thing... has the audacious size and splash about it that mark it shrewdly made for commerce. It&#x27;s good fun.&quot; The Philadelphia Inquirer was enthusiastic as well: &quot;Danny Kaye...is back and all&#x27;s well in the comedy world...Kaye is just about at the top of his varied and wonderful form...The hairbreadth adventures concocted as showcase for his elastic talent and bright with invention and sly enough to make even producers of straight costume pieces of this order laugh at themselves...there are five engaging songs by Sylvia Fine and Sammy Cahn, lush sets, and costumes all enhanced by Technicolor and VistaVision, and an enthusiastic cast which backs up Danny every merry inch of the way.&quot;

The New York Post was equally positive: &quot;This is wonderful Danny Kaye material, giving full scope to his genius for movement, sound and subtle travesty...An English quartet contributes lightly and well to the merriment. Cecil Parker...Angela Lansbury...Basil Rathbone...and Glynis Johns...But it is the comic invention, both in plot an slapstick moment, that sets this musical upon its higher plane. It&#x27;s always babbling along merrily, and never does let down...This is a picture that can be recommended to all and sundry.&quot; The Oakland Tribune thought the film entertaining: &quot;Kaye...makes comic mincemeat out of all movie derring-do that&#x27;s ever been done...in a plot that doesn&#x27;t attempt to make much sense, except as an all-around spoof of knights, jousting, court life and royal intrigue...Kaye sings several ditties...none of these is memorable, but the Sylvia Fine lyrics are amusing as always, especially in the patter numbers at which Kaye is particularly adept. During some of the scenes—played straight by Miss Natwick, Rathbone, Miss Lansbury, Miss Johns and Parker—I got the impression that if the action had lasted a second longer the performers would have burst into uncontrollable laughter at their own lines. You can&#x27;t help but enjoy &#x27;The Court Jester,&#x27; even if it cannot be labelled as Kaye&#x27;s best movie.&quot;

The St. Louis Globe-Democrat described the film as &quot;a large scale, lavishly mounted, sometimes riotous comedy romp...As some of his others, this one points up the two problems faced by producers in fashioning starring vehicles for the lanky star. In the first place, there is the challenge of his versatility. It&#x27;s a formidable task to provide material giving full range to his many and varied talents as singer, dancer, mimic, clown, and just plain low comic. Beyond that there is the danger the comedian will be so clever that much of the humor will sail over the heads of moviegoers inaccustomed to subtleties. In the first respect, his present sponsors, Paramount Pictures, have done exceeding [sic] well by Danny...Kaye&#x27;s fat and juicy role is that of a circus clown who becomes what the title says...the triple-threat [Panama-Frank] team has gone on to devise a serious of situations that give full range to Kaye&#x27;s versatility.&quot; The Los Angeles Evening News liked the movie: &quot;a vastly entertaining piece of celluloid flying the Paramount banner...Kaye isn&#x27;t a comedian only...Kaye&#x27;s chief asset is amazing versatility, and the variety he brings to the role...Storywise, the film is farfetched, but this doesn&#x27;t matter...he evokes many laughs, and he gets some fine help from Glynis Johns...Basil Rathbone...Angela Lansbury...Cecil Parker...and Mildred Natwick...Panama and Frank...rate a nod for a first-rate three-way accomplishment.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine was certain of the film&#x27;s entertainment value: &quot;The Court Jester...is a pleasantly goofy travesty of the olden daze into which Hollywood falls so often and so profitably...When the squirrely-burly&#x27;s done, Jester Kaye has managed to get the false king on his knees, the true one on the throne, the heroine (Glynis Johns) in his arms, the villain on his point, and the audience happily lost in some muddle ages that no history book records.&quot; The Chicago Tribune review was mixed: &quot;The story strains to provide comical situations and, if it weren&#x27;t for Kaye&#x27;s talent, would be remarkably dull. However, Danny bounces around energetically, mugging and singing and clowning, and manages to draw a few guffaws from an audience which seemed rather disinterested the day I saw the picture. Cecil Parker, Glynis Johns, Angela Lansbury, and Mildred Natwick are outstanding...It&#x27;s Danny&#x27;s picture, but not one of his best&quot;

Costing $4 million (equivalent to $ in ) in the fall of 1955, &quot;The Court Jester&quot; was the most expensive comedy film produced up to that time. The motion picture bombed at the box office upon its release, bringing in only $2.2 million in receipts the following winter and spring of 1956 (equivalent to $ in ). However, since then it has become a classic and a television matinee favorite. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on , with a weighted average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A witty spoof of medieval swashbuckler movies, &quot;The Court Jester&quot; showcases Danny Kaye at his nimble, tongue-twisting best.&quot; Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film four out of a possible four stars, calling it &quot;one of the best comedies ever made&quot;.

David Koenig reflects on Danny Kaye&#x27;s legacy and &quot;The Court Jester&quot;, &quot;His legacy has dimmed with the passage of time. His greatest works ... endure today only as memories in the minds of aging members of his audiences ... much of his TV work has not aged particularly well. Whimsy was of another time&quot;. However, Koenig sees Kaye&#x27;s film work in a different light, &quot;History has smiled on individual pictures—in particular the holiday staple of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Court Jester&quot; ... the medieval romp has steadily gained a reputation as one of the greatest comedies of all time.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
In 1957, Danny Kaye received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor – Comedy/Musical, and in 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked #98. In 2004, the United States National Film Registry elected to preserve &quot;The Court Jester&quot; for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>John Sandfield Macdonald, (December 12, 1812 – June 1, 1872) was the joint premier of the Province of Canada from 1862 to 1864. He was also the first premier of Ontario from 1867 to 1871, one of the four founding provinces created at Confederation in 1867. He served as both premier and attorney general of Ontario from July 16, 1867, to December 20, 1871.

He was referred to by his middle name, Sandfield, and often signed his correspondence and documents as &quot;J. Sandfield Macdonald&quot;.

== Early life and legal career ==
Born in 1812 in Glengarry County, Upper Canada, John Sandfield was the first of five children for Alexander and Nancy Macdonald, who were Roman Catholic Highland Scots. His mother died when he was eight. Independent in mind, Macdonald twice tried to set out from home when he was eleven.

Leaving school at 16, he became a clerk at several general stores, before deciding to enter the legal profession, eventually articling under Archibald McLean. When McLean was later elevated to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench for Upper Canada, Macdonald became his assistant, which allowed him to meet Allan MacNab, Thomas Talbot and William Henry Draper (with whom he would resume his articling). Draper and McLean were leaders in the Tory political group.

Macdonald was later appointed as Queen&#x27;s messenger, charged with carrying dispatches between the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada and the British Minister in Washington.

In 1840, while he was on one of his missions from the Lieutenant-Governor (the Earl of Durham) to the British Minister at Washington he met Marie Christine Waggaman, daughter of George Augustus Waggaman, a former Whig senator from Louisiana. They were married in 1840 and raised three children.

== Province of Canada politics ==

In 1841, Macdonald was approached by two local conservative political figures, Alexander Fraser and John McGillivray, to stand for election for the Glengarry riding in the new Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. With their support, he easily won election and entered Parliament, ostensibly in support of Draper. However, Macdonald at this point did not have firm political views, and once in Parliament, he gradually shifted towards the Reform group and away from Draper. In the first session of the Parliament, he supported the union of the Province of Canada and the government of Governor General, Lord Sydenham, but for the rest of the first Parliament, he consistently voted in support of Robert Baldwin, the leader of the Reformers of Canada West.

Macdonald served as a Lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Light Infantry Militia in Toronto in the 1830s and early 1840s. On October 17, 1842, Macdonald was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and appointed to command the 4th Battalion of the Glengarry Militia. He commanded the 4th Glengarry until 1852 when he was replaced by his brother Donald Alexander Macdonald.

A Reformer and advocate of responsible government, Macdonald served in all eight Assemblies of the Province of Canada prior to Confederation. He also served in several pre-confederation administrations, including a period as co-premier of the Province of Canada from 1862 to 1864. It was this time when Macdonald suffered a collapsed lung from chronic tuberculosis.

Macdonald was initially an opponent of confederation, but came to accept it and became an ally of Sir John A. Macdonald (no relation). John A. Macdonald helped manoeuvre Sandfield Macdonald into the position of first Premier of Ontario.

==Premier and Attorney-General of Ontario==
Macdonald was elected for the provincial riding of Cornwall in the first general election of 1867 for the new province of Ontario. He was re-elected in the election of 1871. In addition to serving as Premier, he also occupied the post of Attorney General of Ontario.

Macdonald instituted several notable achievements, in addition to setting up the initial machinery of government for the new Province:

:* An Act modelled on the US Homestead Acts provided for virtually free land for homesteaders on surveyed crown lands of Muskoka, Haliburton and north Hastings, and further Acts encouraged the northern extension of railways into those areas.
:* The District of Muskoka was created to aid in the colonization effort, from townships withdrawn from Simcoe County, Victoria County and the District of Nipissing.
:* Education aid was concentrated into the University of Toronto, at the expense of the denominational colleges.
:* The election laws were reformed in 1868 to establish a single date for elections to be held (as opposed to a range of dates), and to broaden the franchise.

His government was moderate and initially a coalition of liberals and conservatives (described in contemporary accounts as a &quot;Patent Combination&quot; government), but suffered from defections by more radical Reformers. This group joined with the Clear Grits to form the opposition Liberal Party led by Edward Blake and Oliver Mowat. In December 1871, Macdonald&#x27;s government was defeated by Edward Blake&#x27;s Liberals. Macdonald resigned, and died several months later.

In the early years of confederation, politicians were allowed to serve simultaneously in the House of Commons and in a provincial legislature. From 1867 to 1872, Macdonald was also a Liberal MP in the House of Commons of Canada.

==Family==
Macdonald&#x27;s brothers, Donald Alexander Macdonald and Alexander Francis Macdonald, were also politicians, and served as federal Members of Parliament. Donald, who served as an MP the longest of the three brothers, was in the House of Commons concurrently with both Sandfield and Alexander, although Sandfield and Alexander did not serve concurrently with each other.

==Legacy==
Sandfield Macdonald would be the last Roman Catholic Premier of Ontario for 132 years; not until Dalton McGuinty became premier in 2003 would another Roman Catholic assume the office. After Macdonald&#x27;s tenure, sectarian tensions in the province rose, and the Conservative Party increasingly became identified with the Orange Order and sectarian Protestantism. Even though most of the party&#x27;s leaders were not sectarian themselves (with a few notable exceptions), Orange Ontarians became a core constituency of the party that leaders were loath to neglect. Catholics, meanwhile, increasingly voted for the Liberal Party. While the Liberals could never be called a Catholic party, the Catholic vote became as important a constituency to the Liberals as the Orange vote became to the Conservatives.

Nineteenth century religious tensions aside, Macdonald&#x27;s election as Ontario&#x27;s first Premier makes his Catholicity an important historic symbol. Similarly the selection of John Thompson, Canada&#x27;s first Roman Catholic Prime Minister only twenty five years after Confederation, was indicative of the ambitions of Roman Catholics to be full and equal participants in the newly created country.

Macdonald is buried in historic St. Andrews Cemetery in St. Andrews West, South Stormont, Ontario. The gravesite is marked by a bronze plaque, the first under an Ontario Heritage Trust program to honour Ontario premiers at their burial sites, similar to a national program to mark the graves of prime ministers.

The Macdonald Block Complex, a major set of four office towers which house ministries of the Ontario government, is named after Macdonald.

A statue of Macdonald stands in front of the east side of the Ontario Legislative Building in Toronto. The monument, unveiled in 1909, was sculpted by Walter Allward.

He was portrayed by Aidan Devine in the 2011 CBC Television film &quot;John A.: Birth of a Country&quot;.

<doc id="483730" wikidata="Q993944" url="?curid=483730" title="USS San Juan (SSN-751)">
<text>USS &quot;San Juan&quot; (SSN-751), a , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named &quot;San Juan&quot;, though only the second named for San Juan, Puerto Rico. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 30 November 1982 and her keel was laid down on 9 August 1985. She was launched on 6 December 1986 sponsored by Mrs. Sherrill Hernandez, wife of VADM Diego E. Hernández, and commissioned on 6 August 1988.

During the early evening of 13 March 2007, units of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; Carrier Strike Group (CSG) received a series of indications that USS &quot;San Juan&quot; (SSN-751), a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine conducting pre-deployment training with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; CSG, was in distress.

The submarine established communications in the early morning hours of 14 March, and indicated that there were no problems; hence, units were able to stand down from the search and rescue that was already well underway.

==History==
&quot;San Juan&quot; was the first of the Flight III or 688i for &quot;improved&quot; design, that received a number of significant improvements to the previous boats in the class. &quot;San Juan&quot; and all subsequent boats in her class are quieter and incorporate an advanced AN/BSY-1 sonar suite combat system. Another improvement includes the ability to lay mines from their torpedo tubes. &quot;San Juan&quot;″s sail was also strengthened, enabling the ability to break through ice.

=== First 688i through-ice surfacing ===
In 1993 &quot;San Juan&quot; conducted the first through-ice surfacing for a 688i-class submarine in the Arctic.

===Collision with USS &quot;Kentucky&quot;===

On 19 March 1998 off the coast of Long Island, New York, the submerged &quot;San Juan&quot; collided with the surfaced fleet ballistic missile submarine . There were no injuries reported as a result of the collision.

=== Lost communication ===

On 13 March 2007, &quot;San Juan&quot; was the subject of a search and rescue mission by the carrier and elements of her Carrier Strike Group off the coast of Florida, when contact with the submarine was lost, and a red flare was spotted in her projected vicinity, suggesting an emergency. Communications were re-established early the next day when &quot;San Juan&quot; surfaced, and no problems were indicated.

===Visit to South Africa===

On 4 November 2009 &quot;San Juan&quot; arrived at Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa. The ship engaged in at-sea maneuvers with the South African Navy for the first time in U.S. history.

===2010 overhaul===

&quot;San Juan&quot; arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY), Maine, on 8 April 2010 for an engineered overhaul (EOH); for maintenance and system upgrades.

As of 2012 &quot;San Juan&quot; was assigned to Submarine Group Two. Submarine Group Two was disestablished in 2014, and &quot;San Juan&quot; became part of Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMSUBLANT).

<doc id="483745" wikidata="Q1730419" url="?curid=483745" title="Real Genius">
<text>Real Genius is a 1985 American science fiction comedy film directed by Martha Coolidge, written by Neal Israel, Pat Proft, and PJ Torokvei, and starring Val Kilmer and Gabriel Jarret. The film, set on the campus of Pacific Tech, a science and engineering university similar to Caltech, follows Chris Knight (Kilmer), a genius in his senior year, who is paired with a new student on campus, Mitch Taylor (Jarret), to work on a chemical laser, only to learn it will be used for dangerous purposes. The film received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $13 million at the North American box office.

==Plot==
The CIA has covertly hired Professor Jerry Hathaway at Pacific Tech University to develop the power source for &quot;Crossbow&quot;, a laser weapon precise enough to commit illegal political assassinations from outer space. Hathaway uses his position to recruit brilliant students to do the work for him, diverting the CIA&#x27;s funding into building his enormous house.

Hathaway recruits high school student Mitch Taylor, a budding genius in laser physics. Mitch is roomed with Chris Knight, a legend in the &quot;National Physics Club&quot; and one of Mitch&#x27;s idols. Mitch&#x27;s ideal of Chris is shattered, however, when Chris turns out to be more of a slacker than a hard-working student. Meanwhile, Hathaway hopes Mitch will encourage Chris to straighten up his act and that their two exceptional minds can develop a proper power source for &quot;Crossbow&quot;. Mitch also befriends Jordan Cochran, a hyperactive insomniac student for whom he gradually develops romantic feelings.

Kent, Hathaway&#x27;s graduate student (and toady), reports Mitch for attending a pool party with Chris instead of working on the laser. Hathaway lambasts Mitch, who breaks down and tearfully calls his parents. Kent secretly records the call and uses the recording to humiliate Mitch. As Mitch begins packing to leave, Chris explains the pressures of school and burdens of being highly intelligent by relating the history of genius and former Pacific Tech student Lazlo Hollyfeld. Hollyfeld suffered a nervous breakdown when he discovered his creations were being used to kill, and he now lives hidden in the university&#x27;s tunnels, accessed from beneath Chris and Mitch&#x27;s closet. Chris, fearing the same could happen to him, learned to lighten up and enjoy life. Mitch agrees to stay, and they exact revenge on Kent by disassembling his car, a 1972 Citroën DS, and reassembling it in his dorm room.

Hathaway, angry about the still-incomplete project and Chris&#x27;s attitude, informs Chris that he intends to prevent him from earning a degree, blackball him, and give a coveted job, originally promised to Chris, to Kent instead. Chris is disheartened and Mitch must use Chris&#x27;s same argument to convince him to stay. The two create a new laser, but Kent sabotages it, causing it to explode. Though initially despondent, the incident inspires Chris to design and build a six-megawatt excimer laser, which burns a hole through the campus when it is test-fired. Hathaway reverses his position, giving Chris a degree and the job. As Chris and Mitch celebrate, Hollyfeld arrives and informs them that, with certain modifications, their laser could be used as a weapon. A panicked Chris returns to the lab to find the laser gone, as well as Kent&#x27;s projects: a mirror and a tracking system which together can weaponize Chris&#x27;s laser.

Jordan and fellow project member &quot;Ick&quot; Ikagami surreptitiously implant a radio transmitter in Kent&#x27;s braces, which Mitch uses to convince him he is speaking to Jesus. Kent divulges the date of the test, and the group tails Hathaway to learn the location of the Air Force base the CIA is using. Chris and Mitch sneak onto the B-1 Lancer bomber where their equipment has been installed and assist Hollyfeld in reprogramming the laser.

Outside Hathaway&#x27;s home, Chris, Mitch, Jordan, and Ick meet Dean Meredith and a Congressman, to whom they had reported Hathaway&#x27;s plan. Kent arrives unexpectedly and goes inside the house. The laser test begins and, instead of firing on the target, the laser fires on Hathaway&#x27;s house, activating a gigantic popcorn popper. Kent is launched out the front door on a popcorn wave. Hollyfeld arrives in an RV—which he has won using mathematics to rig a sweepstakes—to tell them he is leaving. Hathaway, who hates popcorn, arrives afterwards to find his house destroyed by popcorn.

== Production ==
To prepare for &quot;Real Genius&quot;, Martha Coolidge spent months researching laser technology and the policies of the CIA, and interviewed dozens of students at Caltech. The screenplay was extensively rewritten, first by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, later by Coolidge and PJ Torokvei.

Producer Brian Grazer remembers that when Val Kilmer came in to audition for the role of Chris Knight, he brought candy bars and performed tricks. Kilmer remembered it differently. &quot;The character wasn&#x27;t polite, so when I shook Grazer&#x27;s hand and he said, &#x27;Hi, I&#x27;m the producer,&#x27; I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry. You look like you&#x27;re 12 years old. I like to work with men.&#x27;&quot;

To achieve the house filled with popcorn for the film&#x27;s climax, the production team popped popcorn continuously for three months. The popcorn was treated with fire retardant so it would not combust and covered so that it would not be eaten by birds and possibly poison them. The popcorn was then shipped to a subdivision under construction in Canyon Country, northwest of Los Angeles, and placed in the house.

To promote the film, the studio held what it billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first computer press conference&quot;, with Coolidge and Grazer answering journalists&#x27; questions via computer terminals and relayed over the CompuServe online service.

The dorm in the film is based on Dabney House at Caltech, and Caltech students served as consultants and played extras in the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Real Genius&quot; was released on August 9, 1985, in 990 theaters, grossing $2.5 million in its first weekend. It went on to make $12,952,019 in North America.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;It follows college tropes, but &quot;Real Genius&quot; has an optimistic streak that puts you on Val Kilmer&#x27;s side all the way.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 71 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed the film for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #85, and stated that it was &quot;yet another celebration of the anxious wonder of growing up white, middle-class and heterosexual in America. The lovable weirdos squabble in the lab, play hi-tech pranks in the dorm and party in the lecture theater. Nerds just wanna have fun. Nerds have feelings too. Hug a Nerd today.&quot;

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;the film is best when it takes [the students] seriously, though it does so only intermittently.&quot; David Ansen wrote in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;When it&#x27;s good, the dormitory high jinks feel like the genuine release of teen-age tensions and cruelty. Too bad the story isn&#x27;t as smart as the kids in it.&quot; In her review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote, &quot;Many of the scenes, already badly written, fail to fulfill their screwball potential... [D]espite its enthusiastic young cast and its many good intentions, it doesn&#x27;t quite succeed. I guess there&#x27;s a leak in the think tank.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, saying that it &quot;contains many pleasures, but one of the best is its conviction that the American campus contains life as we know it.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Salem Alaton wrote, &quot;Producer Brian Grazer craved a feel-good picture, and she [Martha Coolidge] turned in the summer&#x27;s best, and she didn&#x27;t cheat to do it. There&#x27;s heart in the kookiness. &quot;Real Genius&quot; has real people, real comedy and real fun.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; praised the film for being &quot;a smart, no-nonsense movie that may actually teach its prime audience a valuable lesson: the best retort to an intolerable situation is not necessarily a food fight. Better results, and more fun, come from rubbing a few brains briskly together.&quot;

==Scientific accuracy==
In the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;Car vs. Rain&quot;, first broadcast on June 17, 2009, the &quot;MythBusters&quot; team tried to determine whether the final scene in the film, the destruction of Dr Hathaway&#x27;s house with laser-popped popcorn, is actually possible. First they used a ten-watt laser to pop a single kernel wrapped in aluminum foil, showing that popping corn is possible with a laser. Then they tested a scaled-down model of a house. The popcorn was popped through induction heating because a sufficiently large laser was not available. The result was that the popcorn was unable to expand sufficiently to break glass, much less break open a door or move the house off its foundation. Instead, it ceased to expand and then simply charred.

It was also specifically stated in the program that a five-megawatt laser still did not exist, even in military applications, and that the most powerful military laser they knew of was 100 kilowatts.

In January 2011, it was further demonstrated on video in a home setting that a kernel of corn directly exposed to laser light from accessible consumer level lasers could be popped as reported by TechCrunch.

The solid xenon-halogen laser proposed and built by Chris in the latter half of the film, though in the realm of science fiction, was based on a theory of the time. &quot;Real Genius&quot;, through consultant Martin A. Gundersen, who played the math professor, was later cited in an academic publication that detailed the scientific basis behind the laser.

==Television series==
Reports surfaced in September 2014 that a potential television series was in the works. NBC was set to produce the comedy series with Sony TV, Happy Madison and 3 Arts Entertainment. there were no updates on the production.

<text>The Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL) is a music programming language written in the 1980s by Larry Polansky, Phil Burk, and David Rosenboom at Mills College. Written on top of Forth, it allowed for the creation of real-time interactive music performance systems, algorithmic composition software, and any other kind of program that requires a high degree of musical informatics. It was distributed by Frog Peak Music, and runs with a very light memory footprint (~1 megabyte) on Macintosh and Amiga systems.

Unlike CSound and other languages for audio synthesis, HMSL is primarily a language for making &quot;music&quot;. As such, it interfaces with sound-making devices through built-in MIDI classes. However, it has a high degree of built-in understanding of music performance practice, tuning systems, and score reading. Its main interface for the manipulation of musical parameters is through the metaphor of shapes, which can be created, altered, and combined to create a musical texture, either by themselves or in response to real-time or scheduled events in a score.

HMSL has been widely used by composers working in algorithmic composition for over twenty years. In addition to the authors (who are also composers), HMSL has been used in pieces by Nick Didkovsky, The Hub, James Tenney, Tom Erbe, and Pauline Oliveros.

A Java port of HMSL was developed by Nick Didkovsky under the name JMSL, and is designed to interface to the JSyn API.

HMSL is licensed under the free Apache License V2.

<text>Guy Philippe (; born 29 February 1968) is a Haitian former police officer, politician, and convicted money launderer, who led the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état against president Jean-Bertrand Aristide after being fired from the police in 2000.

He originally gained power in Haiti as a paramilitary leader, and had participated in the electoral process to become a political leader. He led the 2000-2004 paramilitary insurgency that culminated in the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état ousting Haiti&#x27;s elected government and President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Philippe was a presidential candidate in the 2006 Haitian general election, receiving nearly 2% of the vote.

Philippe served time in U.S. federal prison from 2017 to 2023: On 21 June 2017, the United States, where he had spent some of the illegal proceeds, sentenced him to nine years in federal prison, in connection with money he received for ensuring police protection of drug trafficking during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The charges did not address any of the numerous deaths that were documented as being carried out by death squads that he led between 2000 and 2004. In 2023, Philippe was repatriated from U.S. federal prison to Haiti.

==Early life==
Philippe was born in Pestel, in the province of Grand&#x27;Anse. He obtained his primary and secondary education at Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague. Human Rights watch alleges that in his late teens he was a death squad leader during the rebellion against Baby Doc Duvalier and in the turmoil which followed.

According to Philippe, he &quot;has a law degree from Ecuador and studied medicine in Mexico for a year.&quot; In 1992, he received a scholarship from the Haitian Armed Forces (FAd&#x27;H) to Ecuador&#x27;s police academy (La Escuela Superior de Policía &quot;Gral. Alberto Enríquez Gallo&quot;), where he graduated in 1995. Part of his training during this time was with US Special Forces. When he returned to Haiti, the FAd&#x27;H had been dismantled. He was assigned to the newly created police force, which is why he was never formally part of the Haitian army.

==Career==
Philippe accepted a commission as a commander in the Haitian National Police, and then became the police chief of the Port-au-Prince suburb of Delmas from 1997 to 1999. International monitors later &quot;learned that dozens of suspected gang members were summarily executed, mainly by police under the command of Inspector Berthony Bazile, Philippe&#x27;s deputy.&quot; In 1999 he was made police chief of Cap-Haïtien.

===2000s: Coup d&#x27;etat and political beginnings===
On 15 January 2000, Guy Philippe and his wife had a daughter named Aïsha. Following October 2000 accusations of participation in a coup plot and his subsequent removal from his post as police chief of Cap-Haïtien, Philippe fled to the Dominican Republic. While there he recruited ex-military and others forming a paramilitary organization, which was alleged to have received training from the U.S. Government. 

The Haitian government accused Philippe of masterminding a deadly attack on the Police Academy in July 2001 and of an attempted coup in December 2001. In July 2003, witnesses place him, together with Voltaire Jean-Batiste, leading a death squad operating in eastern Haiti just across the Dominican border.

In February 2004, he returned from the Dominican Republic with his paramilitary group to join the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état against president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Five days after crossing back into Haiti and joining former militia leader Louis-Jodel Chamblain in announcing his support for anti-government forces, Philippe was given command of the rebel army.

On 2 March 2004, Philippe and his paramilitaries retook control of the former Haitian Army headquarters across from the National Palace. Philippe declared to the international press that he was now in control of 90% of Haiti&#x27;s armed forces. In an address on Haitian Radio, Philippe declared, &quot;The country is in my hands.&quot; He summoned twenty police commanders to meet with him the previous day and warned that if they failed to appear he would arrest them.

That same day, Philippe announced he would arrest Haitian Prime Minister Yvon Neptune, who is a top official of Aristide&#x27;s Lavalas party. As published at the time by Democracy Now!, quoting sources in Haiti: &quot;Neptune&#x27;s home was burned and looted and that he was being pursued by armed gangs. People close to Neptune reported that he fears for his life. Local radio reported that Neptune was evacuated from his office by helicopter as Guy Philippe led a mob in a march to the office. Meanwhile, there are reports of regular execution-style killings on the Haitian seaside.&quot;.

Early in 2005, Philippe&#x27;s guerrilla group, the Front for National Reconstruction (FRN) which was involved in the coup of 2004 was officially transformed into a recognized political party. On 11 July 2005, Guy Philippe announced he would run for president for the FRN party. Philippe has been critical of the administration of the interim government, blaming them for the slow process of setting up registration centers throughout Haiti. Early on he was considered a front runner for the 2006 Haitian general election but later fell behind the main contenders simply because he did not have the money required for a campaign. In spite of his international and local rebel backers and appealing to young Haitians to follow him, Philippe won less than 1% of the vote, demonstrating that he had failed to project his persona as a popular hero.

===2010s: Drug smuggling and legal trouble===
Shortly after dawn on 16 July 2007, five helicopters, two planes and more than a dozen heavily armed DEA and Haitian anti-drug agents surrounded Philippe&#x27;s home in the hills above Les Cayes, on Haiti&#x27;s remote southern peninsula, to seize evidence of drug trafficking. Philippe was suspected of ties to illegal drug trafficking in Haiti. Philippe&#x27;s supporters said the allegations against him were politically motivated, noting he had recently threatened to identify powerful Haitians who provided financial support for the 2004 coup d&#x27;état. 

Philippe was indicted in the United States on charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and money laundering. Following his indictment, Philippe isolated himself in his hometown of Pestel, protected by his paramilitaries.

In 2015, Philippe began his campaign for Senator in the Haitian parliament, as a member of the National Consortium of Haitian Political Parties (CNPPH). His paramilitary units continued a guerrilla war to &quot;create havoc and overthrow the provisional president, Jocelerme Privert.&quot; In the final election, Philippe won the seat for Grand&#x27;Anse department, and was due to be sworn in on 9 January.

On the afternoon of 5 January 2017, Guy Philippe was arrested on these charges as he walked out of a popular radio show. He was extradited to the US on the same day as his arrest. His arrest was not without controversy as the newly-elected senator had not yet been sworn in, and thus had not received the immunity from legal charges or arrest that is provided under Haitian law to protect serving lawmakers. There were questions about the legality of the extradition.

On 21 June 2017, after pleading guilty to money laundering, Philippe was given a nine-year sentence by the United States federal government (USFG) for taking bribes from drug smugglers.

===2020s===
After serving his sentence, he was promptly deported back to Haiti in November 2023, and quickly re-launched his political career, vowing to fix the gang war in Haiti.

By March 2024, with the pending resignation of Ariel Henry, he was considered to be a powerful player, potentially able to negotiate with Jimmy Chérizier. By early March, he declared himself a candidate for president. In August 2024, Guy Philippe announced the formation of a new political party the Revolutionary Force of National Accord (FREN) of which Guy Philippe is the national coordinator. The announcement was made at a press conference by Nader Joiséus, former minister of public works and deputy national coordinator of the new party.

<doc id="483752" wikidata="Q1641831" url="?curid=483752" title="Hârn">
<text>Hârn is a campaign setting for fantasy role-playing games, designed by N. Robin Crossby, and published by Columbia Games in 1983.

In 1998 Crossby founded Kelestia Productions (KP), an electronic publishing e-company. KP and CGI now independently produce printed and online materials for use with Hârn-based role-playing campaigns and fiction.

The role-playing game, &quot;HârnMaster,&quot; was developed specifically for use with Hârn. It enables players, gamemasters, and writers to develop character descriptions that exploit the deep level of detail found in Hârn.

==History==
The campaign world of Hârn was first described in the set &quot;Hârn&quot; (1983) from Columbia Games, which presented a folio with a general overview, with background, history, and religion of the island of Hârn along with the small Hârndex encyclopaedia, and a map of Hârn drawn by N. Robin Crossby. Shannon Appelcline described that &quot;Hârn was broadly based on Norman England, with some fantasy elements appearing through dwarves, elves and orcs. It was low magic and [...] tried to create a genuinely real setting, based on careful research and consideration.&quot;

== Setting ==
Hârn is an island off the western coast of the region of Venârivè (the northwestern part of the continent of Lýthia) on the planet Kèthîra, but as Hârn has traditionally been the focus of the setting, many people refer to the world as Hârn or HârnWorld. Hârn is notable for several reasons:

* It has no &#x27;evil&#x27; versus &#x27;good&#x27; aspect that dominates many other FRPGs. 
* It has a high level of detail and internal consistency. A large number of individual cities, fortifications, towns, manors and adventure locations have been described down to the names of the peasant families residing there. In its immense detail it rivals other game worlds known for their depth, such as Tekumel.
* It is also notable for its high level of realism and a concomitant low level of magic. Its societies are, for the most part, modeled closely on Earth during the Middle Ages (specifically, that of Norman Britain). Nonetheless, it has many of the standard trappings of fantasy, such as elves, dwarves, orcs, wizards, etc. Many of these have a unique Hârnic spin.
* The written history and events of Hârn are current up to a specific point in time (midnight on the first day of the year 720), and there is no intention of &quot;advancing&quot; the official timeline beyond this point. The individual game masters control the history and events that occur after this point. Thus, all Hârn games are unique but spring from a common starting point.

The island of Hârn has seven human kingdoms and two kingdoms ruled by other species. In alphabetical order, these are:

* Azadmere is the home of the &quot;Khuzdul&quot;, the Hârnic dwarves.
* Chybisa is viewed as a struggling independent monarchy or a breakaway county of Kaldor.
* Evael is located along the southern coast and is the forest home of the reclusive &quot;Sindarian&quot;, the Hârnic elves.
* Kaldor is a feudal kingdom with a weak king. Located at the hub of four trade routes, it is a power in the east. It is perhaps the most detailed of all of the kingdoms.
* Kanday is a stolid, chivalric kingdom situated in the western part of the island of Hârn.
* Melderyn is the most ancient kingdom on Hârn, reputedly founded by wizards. It is located in the southeastern part of the island and claims a monopoly on trade with the Lythian continent.
* The northern land of Orbaal was once a collection of peaceful princedoms inhabited by the Jarin people (analogues of the British Celts) until it was conquered by the Ivinians (analogous to the Vikings). Now the Jarin are brutally suppressed, but some plot rebellion.
* Rethem is widely viewed as the &quot;evil kingdom&quot; but this is because its rulers value might and merit over birth and privilege (or, possibly, because its largest town was the base for a crusade by the church of the death-god Morgath). It is a kingdom born of war and beset by enemies on all sides.
* Tharda rose from the ashes of the former Corani Empire (as did Kanday and Rethem) and is the island&#x27;s only non-monarchist state; its patron-client social structure is superficially similar to that of Roman Republic. Petty corruption and patronage are rife. The Republic is very ambitious in its territorial claims.

The island is also home to over a dozen human &quot;barbarian&quot; tribal nations and many bands of Hârnic orcs, known as &quot;gârgún&quot;.

The planet Kèthîra, on which Hârn is situated, is one of seven linked parallel worlds collectively known as Keléstia. Among the other worlds in the family are Terra (or Earth); Yàsháin, a high-magic world which is the afterlife of Kèthîra; Midgaad, a parallel of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth; and the Blessed Realm, a parallel of the land of the same name in Tolkien&#x27;s works. It is suggested that the ancestors of Kèthîra&#x27;s elves and dwarves came from Midgaad to Kèthîra; in the case of the elves this is a stopping off point on a longer journey to the Blessed Realm. Kèthîra&#x27;s Sinái retain the custom of building swan-shaped ships in which they sail to the Blessed Realm when they weary of their time on Hârn (in this case sailing through a periodically appearing interworld portal known as the &quot;Nimeliant&quot; off Hârn&#x27;s northeastern coast).

In addition to the island of Hârn itself, products have been released covering the nearby regions of Shôrkýnè (a large feudal kingdom with a weak king) and Ivínia (an analogue of Scandinavia complete with fjords, Vikings, and a religion similar to that of the old Norse).

Other products have been released detailing the island kingdom of Chélemby, a mixed-Ivínian trading state (an analogue of the medieval Scandinavian trading state of Visby). A product detailing the nearby Hârbáaler kingdom of Lédenheim is also available.

Most recently, a product has been released which details the whole sub-continental region of Venârivè (an area roughly equivalent to Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle-East). This product provides the basis for adventuring and exploration beyond the island of Hârn, and puts the island and its cultures in their wider context.

==Reception==
In the September 1983 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 77), Roger Moore liked the Hârn game system. He admired the map, which he called, &quot;beautiful. If you are a fan of fantasy cartography, the map makes a wonderful addition to one’s collection, having lots of legible detail and a well worked out ecological system and geography.&quot; Moore was also quite impressed with the booklet called the &quot;Harndex&quot; that listed all sorts of interesting information on people and places. He noted some similarities to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, but pointed out that gamemasters could easily expunge that material if they wished. He concluded by recommending the Hârn game system to &quot;experienced referees who don’t mind using a largely prefabricated universe with a few minor alterations to suit their own campaign tastes... State of the art? It could be better, but it is very good.&quot;

Three years later, in the March 1986 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 107), Eric Pass reviewed some of the supplementary material that had been published, namely the &quot;Cities of&quot; Hârn supplement, &quot;Encyclopedia Harnica #1-#13&quot; and the regional module &quot;Ivinia&quot;. Pass liked all of them, saying, &quot;All of these products are richly detailed and fully consistent. The only complaint I with this material is the [high] prices.&quot; He concluded that &quot;This material is a savior for the hard-pressed GM whose players expect and demand detailed playing environments and backgrounds. All of the supplements contain well-constructed, consistent, interesting information that will take hours to absorb. Keep a notebook by your side as you read, because you’ll get all sorts of ideas for play.&quot;

Ten years later, in the May 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 229), Rick Swan reviewed the rereleased and revised &quot;Harn World&quot; boxed set. Swan admitted that it &quot;emphasizes culture and economics at the expense of magic and monsters, making it less appealing to hack ’n’slashers than to veterans who take their games seriously.&quot; He also conceded that the rules system was very complex: &quot;Unwieldy? Perhaps. To call &quot;Harn World&quot; ambitious is like calling the Grand Canyon a large hole.&quot; But Swan recommended the &quot;Harn World&quot; system to experienced players, saying, &quot;If you’ve outgrown dungeon crawls, you might be ready to jump in.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;All of this material is methodical and internally consistent. Nothing else in the mid &#x27;80s, and a good deal after, right up to now, comes close to providing the amount of detail in &quot;Hârn&quot;. Depth and breadth. There are like a million &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; books, and it is still no contest.&quot;

== Community==
Columbia published most of the canon material about Hârn in the early 1980s; at that point (around the time the first edition of the Harnmaster rules was published) the interval between new products lengthened and some scheduled products were never completed (such as the Trierzon and Azeryan regional modules). The setting was sustained throughout the 1990s and early 2000s by fan-created material, popularly called &quot;fanon.&quot; The high quality and consistency of the fanon products, as well as the interactivity of message fora such as HarnList and HârnForum have kept the setting alive.

Hârnic fanon, although independently written, is notable for its goal of staying consistent with the hundreds of pages of canon material spread over more than twenty years of publication. In many instances high quality art was produced and professional grade layout and design was done to make the material look similar to products produced by the publishers. There are points of confusion regarding the sanctioning and format of fanon. Both CGI and Kelestia have different fanon guidelines.

<text>Thomas Laird Kennedy (August 15, 1878 – February 13, 1959) was a politician in Ontario, Canada, and served briefly as the 15th premier of Ontario, from 1948 to 1949. He was first elected as the Conservative member for Peel in the 1919 provincial election. He had been a longtime resident of Streetsville (now part of Mississauga), Ontario, where he was master of River Park Masonic Lodge in 1908 and 1909.

Kennedy was first appointed Minister of Agriculture in 1930 by Premier Howard Ferguson and continued in the position under Premier George S. Henry until the Conservative government&#x27;s defeat in the 1934 provincial election. Kennedy was a casualty in the election losing his seat to the landslide that elected the government of Liberal Mitchell Hepburn. Kennedy returned to the legislature in the 1937 election and returned to government when the newly renamed Progressive Conservatives won the 1943 election.

The new premier, George Drew, returned Kennedy to the position of Minister of Agriculture he had held a decade previously. Drew moved to federal politics in 1948 after losing his own seat in the 1948 provincial election which, nevertheless, re-elected the Tory government.

Following Drew&#x27;s departure, Kennedy was named interim leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, and thus also Premier of Ontario. He remained so for seven months until the party could hold its April 27, 1949 leadership convention. The convention elected Leslie Frost as the new party leader, who succeeded Kennedy as Premier on May 4, 1949. Kennedy remained as Agriculture Minister until 1953, when he stepped down from Cabinet at the age of 75. He remained a member of the legislature until his death in 1959.

==Legacy==
Thomas L. Kennedy Secondary School in Mississauga, which first opened to students in 1953, was named in his honour. It is the oldest school of its kind in the city that is still in operation.

Tomken Road is named after him, in the form of a portmanteau. There is no evidence that Kennedy Road in Mississauga, Brampton, and Caledon is named for him. Rather it is believed to be named for a family that lived on the route. Kennedy is related to the Kennedy settlers in Scarborough Township, for whom (namely James Kennedy) Kennedy Road in eastern Toronto and York Region is named.

His nephew Douglas Kennedy was a Tory MPP from 1967 to 1985.

<text>USS &quot;Santee&quot; was a wooden-hulled, three-masted sailing frigate of the United States Navy. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be so named and was one of its last sailing frigates in service. She was acquired by the Union Navy at the start of the American Civil War, outfitted with heavy guns and a crew of 480, and was assigned as a gunboat in the Union blockade of the Confederate States. She later became a training ship then a barracks ship for the U.S. Naval Academy.

== Service history ==

Rated at 44 guns, she was laid down in 1820 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, but due to a shortage of funds, she long remained uncompleted on the stocks. She was finally launched on 16 February 1855, but not commissioned until 9 June 1861, Captain Henry Eagle in command. &quot;Santee&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 20 June 1861, stopped at Hampton Roads, Virginia to load ammunition, and resumed her voyage to the Gulf of Mexico on 10 July. On 8 August, the frigate captured the schooner &quot;C. P. Knapp&quot; in the gulf some 350 miles south of Pensacola and escorted the blockade runner to that port. On 27 October, &quot;Santee&quot; took her second prize, &quot;Delta&quot;, off Galveston; the hermaphrodite brig had attempted to slip into Galveston with a cargo of salt from Liverpool.

Shortly before midnight on 7 November, boats left the frigate and entered Galveston Bay hoping to capture and burn the Confederate armed steamer, &quot;General Rusk&quot;. However, in attempting to avoid detection, the boats ran aground. Since he had lost the advantage of surprise, the expedition&#x27;s commander, Lt. James Edward Jouett, cancelled his plans to attack &quot;General Rusk&quot; and turned his attention to the chartered Confederate lookout vessel, &quot;CS Royal Yacht&quot;. After a desperate hand-to-hand fight, he captured &quot;Royal Yacht&quot;″s crew, set the armed schooner afire, and retired to &quot;Santee&quot; with about a dozen prisoners. During the action, one man from the frigate was killed and two of her officers and six of her men were wounded, one mortally. A young 15-year-old sailor named James Henry Carpenter was wounded in the thigh and mentioned in dispatches due to his actions. Carpenter would become &quot;Santee&quot;″s acting Master&#x27;s mate and would serve again on &quot;Santee&quot; when she served as a school ship for the United States Naval Academy. Another of &quot;Santee&quot;″s sailors, George H. Bell, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his part in the action.

On 30 December, after a five or six-mile chase on boats from &quot;Santee,&quot; they captured 14-ton Confederate schooner, &quot;Garonne&quot;. Captain Eagle stripped the prize for use as a lighter. In January 1862, when the Union naval force in the Gulf of Mexico was divided into two squadrons, &quot;Santee&quot; was assigned to Flag Officer David Farragut&#x27;s new West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Under the new organization, &quot;Santee&quot; continued to blockade the Texas coast, primarily off Galveston, until summer. Then, because scurvy had weakened the frigate&#x27;s crew and the enlistments of many of her sailors had expired, the ship sailed north. She reached Boston, Massachusetts on 22 August and was decommissioned on 4 September.

Refitted at the Boston Navy Yard, the ship was recommissioned there exactly a month later and sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, to serve as a school ship at the Naval Academy, which had been moved there from Annapolis, Maryland, for security during the Civil War. At Newport, midshipmen lived, studied, and attended classes in frigates &quot;Santee&quot; and as they prepared for positions of leadership in the Union Navy. After the close of the Civil War, the Naval Academy returned to Annapolis, Maryland, and &quot;Santee&quot;, carrying midshipmen, sailed for that port and moored near Fort Severn on 2 August 1865. There, she continued her duty as school ship which she had performed at Newport.

===Post-war career===
In 1866, she became a gunnery ship and was used by midshipmen to master the art of naval gunnery. About the same time, the frigate began to be used as a barracks ship for midshipmen being punished and for new fourthclassmen receiving their first taste of Navy life.

Before dawn on 2 April 1912, after a half a century of duty as an educator, &quot;Santee&quot; sank at her mooring. Efforts to refloat the frigate proved unsuccessful. She was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 2 August 1912, the anniversary of her arrival at Annapolis. After six months of effort, she was finally raised; and, on 8 May 1913, &quot;Santee&quot; departed the Severn River under tow and proceeded to Boston, where she was burned for the copper and brass in her hull.

<text>Jean de Montreuil (1354, Monthureux-le-Sec – 29 May 1418, Paris) was a French scholar of the late 14th and early 15th century and a friend of Laurent de Premierfait.

==Life==
He was among the first to invoke Salic Law as a reasoning against female succession to the throne. He used its implications to argue against the claims of Henry IV of England, who was also patron of Christine de Pizan, the scholar with whom Montreuil often debated over the proper conduct and role of women in the monarchy and society in general.

<text>Robert Hammond Patrick (born November 5, 1958) is an American actor. Known for portraying villains and authority figures, Patrick is a Saturn Award winner with four other nominations.

Patrick dropped out of college when drama class sparked his interest in acting, and entered film in 1986. After playing a supporting role in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990), he came to prominence as the T-1000, the antagonist of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) — a role he reprised for cameo appearances in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992) and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993). His other film credits include &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (1993), &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996), &quot;Cop Land&quot; (1997), &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998), &quot;Spy Kids&quot; (2001), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), &quot;Ladder 49&quot; (2004), &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2005), &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006), &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; (2006), &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; (2007), &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; (2009), and &quot;Safe House&quot; (2012).

In television, Patrick played FBI Special Agent John Doggett in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Colonel Tom Ryan in &quot;The Unit&quot;, DHS agent Cabe Gallo in &quot;Scorpion&quot;, and Auggie Smith / White Dragon in &quot;Peacemaker&quot;. He has played ongoing roles in series such as &quot;1923&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Elvis&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Last Resort&quot;, &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, its spin-off &quot;Mayans M.C.&quot;, Jamie Hawkins in &quot;The Night Agent&quot;, and &quot;From Dusk till Dawn: The Series&quot;, and Old Man Logan in the radio drama podcast series &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wastelanders&quot;.

AllMovie journalist Tracie Cooper wrote that, by the conclusion of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 2002, Patrick had developed a &quot;solid reputation within the industry&quot;, with critics, fans and co-stars alike praising his &quot;work ethic, personality, and consistent performances.&quot; Actor and director Jason Bateman described Patrick as &quot;one of the great heavies.&quot;

==Early life==
Patrick was born in Marietta, Georgia, on November 5, 1958, and raised there, as well as in Boston, Massachusetts, Dayton, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Bay Village, Ohio. He is the eldest of five children born to Nadine and Robert M. Patrick.

Patrick did not start to pursue an acting career until his mid-twenties. During his childhood, he did not like to act. In third grade, Patrick refused to wear a pair of green tights required for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. He graduated from Farmington High School in Farmington, Michigan in 1977. Patrick was a track and field and football athlete at Bowling Green State University. He dropped out before graduating when he found an interest in drama and acting. After leaving college, Patrick worked as a house painter and continued as such until a boating accident in 1984 in Lake Erie. He swam for three hours in order to save others still stranded on the accident site, and nearly drowned in doing so. After the accident, he moved to Los Angeles at age 26.

==Career==

Patrick first appeared in several low-budget science-fiction and action films produced by Roger Corman and shot in the Philippines by Cirio H. Santiago. Looking back, he credited his early appearances in films to his &quot;tough-looking exterior&quot;. He played leading roles in pictures such as &quot;Eye of the Eagle&quot;, &quot;Equalizer 2000&quot; or &quot;Future Hunters&quot;. Patrick later commented that his experience with Santiago had been his &quot;film school&quot;. The B movies he made in the Philippines helped him get a SAG card. Patrick&#x27;s first major Hollywood film was &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, in a small part as a henchman for Colonel Stuart, before landing the role of the T-1000, the villain of James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991). Cameron said he chose Patrick because of his physical appearance, which he felt fit the role. Patrick was &quot;broke&quot; at the time, living in a cheap apartment with his girlfriend, Barbara, whom he married during shooting. He has credited the film with starting his career.

After &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, Patrick landed roles in various feature films such as &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (both 1993) and &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996). Because of his fondness for martial arts, Patrick starred in two martial arts films titled &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong 97&quot;, both released in 1994, and even had a fight scene with taekwondo master Hwang Jang-Lee in Future Hunters (1988). 

His performance in &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; led &quot;The X-Files&quot; creator Chris Carter to cast him in that series for the role of John Doggett. Patrick&#x27;s brother, Richard, had previously worked for the series by adding music for the soundtrack albums &quot;Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files&quot; in 1996 and &quot;The X-Files: The Album&quot; in 1998. Patrick was cast as Doggett in 2000. &quot;The X-Files&quot; was canceled two seasons later, after Duchovny left the show following season 7, which resulted in low ratings for the show. Patrick made several appearances on many genre magazines, with &quot;TV Guide&quot; going so far as to label him one of the Ten Sexiest Men of Sci-Fi.

In 2000, Patrick appeared in three episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (&quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Bust Out&quot; and &quot;Funhouse&quot;) as David &quot;Davey&quot; Scatino, a store owner struggling with gambling debts owed to Richie Aprile and Tony Soprano. Four years later, he made a guest appearance in the pilot episodes for Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s original series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Rising&quot;, as the military component commander of the Atlantis expedition, Marshall Sumner. He accepted the role, since he had worked with the same crew on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, a series which he appeared in during the early 1990s.

Patrick played Johnny Cash&#x27;s father, Ray Cash, in the film &quot;Walk the Line&quot; and Elvis&#x27;s father, Vernon Presley in the miniseries &quot;Elvis.&quot; In 2003, he appeared in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;, which reunited him with his &quot;Striptease&quot; co-star, Demi Moore. He had a regular role on &quot;The Unit&quot;, and played Elvis Presley in &quot;Lonely Street&quot; (2009). In October 2006, he starred in the WWE Films production &quot;The Marine&quot; as Rome. He also appeared in &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; as Marshall University head coach Rick Tolley, who lost his life when Southern Airways Flight 932 crashed in 1970. His credits also include a guest starring role in the &quot;Lost&quot; episode &quot;Outlaws&quot;, as well as a recurring role as the voice of Master Piandao in of the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;&quot;. Patrick played a supporting role in &quot;Firewall&quot;, a 2006 action film starring Harrison Ford. He has also appeared in Meat Loaf&#x27;s music video &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot; with Will Estes.

Director McG, who directed &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, said that he wanted to reintroduce characters from the previous &quot;Terminator&quot; films: &quot;I like the idea and the perspective for the next picture that you meet Robert Patrick the way he looks today, and he&#x27;s a scientist that&#x27;s working on, you know, improving cell replication so we can stay healthier and we can cure diabetes and do all these things that sound like good ideas, and to once again live as idealized expressions as ourselves.&quot; Patrick also starred in the psychological thriller &quot;The Black Water of Echo&#x27;s Pond&quot;, which was directed by Italian filmmaker Gabriel Bologna. In recent years, he has appeared in such television series as &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;True Blood&quot;, among others. From 2012 to 2013, he also starred in &quot;Last Resort&quot; as Chief of the Boat Joseph Prosser. He played a supporting character in &quot;Identity Thief&quot; (2013). From 2014 to 2016, he starred in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;From Dusk till Dawn: The Series&quot; as Jacob Fuller. He also played Agent Cabe Gallo on the CBS drama series &quot;Scorpion&quot; from 2014 to 2018.
On March 28, 2017, Patrick was cast in Amazon Video horror anthology series &quot;Lore&quot;, which is based on the award-winning and critically acclaimed podcast of the same name. &quot;Lore&quot; recounts true stories of frightening and paranormal occurrences. &quot;Lore&quot; premiered on October 13, 2017, and ran for two seasons. In 2021, Patrick starred in &quot;Rushed&quot;, co-produced by Lars von Trier&#x27;s Zentropa Entertainment, and written by Siobhan Fallon Hogan. Also starring Jake Weary and Peri Gilpin, Vertical Entertainment has acquired the distribution rights.
In 2022, Robert Patrick played Auggie Smith / White Dragon, the racist supervillain father of Peacemaker in the HBO Max series &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, and he voiced Wolverine in the &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wastelanders: Wolverine&quot; podcast.

==Personal life==
Patrick married actress Barbara Hooper in 1990. They have appeared together in various films and TV shows such as &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. They have two children: a son and a daughter. His younger brother is musician Richard Patrick, the lead singer of Filter.

Patrick is a devout Episcopalian. He is also a member of the Boozefighters motorcycle club.

In August 2022, Patrick revealed for the first time that he struggled with substance abuse early on in his career and how it affected his momentum of procuring different acting roles after &quot;Terminator 2.&quot;

<text>The Synthesis Toolkit (STK) is an open source API for real time audio synthesis with an emphasis on classes to facilitate the development of physical modelling synthesizers. It is written in C++ and is written and maintained by Perry Cook at Princeton University and Gary Scavone at McGill University. It contains both low-level synthesis and signal processing classes (oscillators, filters, etc.) and higher-level instrument classes which contain examples of most of the currently available physical modelling algorithms in use today. STK is free software, but a number of its classes, particularly some physical modelling algorithms, are covered by patents held by Stanford University and Yamaha.

The STK is used widely in creating software synthesis applications. Versions of the STK instrument classes have been integrated into ChucK, Csound, Real-Time Cmix, Max/MSP (as part of PeRColate), SuperCollider and FAUST. It has been ported to SymbianOS and iOS as well.

<text>In computer systems a loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries. It is one of the essential stages in the process of starting a program, as it places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. Loading a program involves either memory-mapping or copying the contents of the executable file containing the program instructions into memory, and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running. Once loading is complete, the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program code.

All operating systems that support program loading have loaders, apart from highly specialized computer systems that only have a fixed set of specialized programs. Embedded systems typically do not have loaders, and instead, the code executes directly from ROM or similar. In order to load the operating system itself, as part of booting, a specialized boot loader is used. In many operating systems, the loader resides permanently in memory, though some operating systems that support virtual memory may allow the loader to be located in a region of memory that is pageable.

In the case of operating systems that support virtual memory, the loader may not actually copy the contents of executable files into memory, but rather may simply declare to the virtual memory subsystem that there is a mapping between a region of memory allocated to contain the running program&#x27;s code and the contents of the associated executable file. (See memory-mapped file.) The virtual memory subsystem is then made aware that pages with that region of memory need to be filled on demand if and when program execution actually hits those areas of unfilled memory. This may mean parts of a program&#x27;s code are not actually copied into memory until they are actually used, and unused code may never be loaded into memory at all.

== Responsibilities ==
In Unix, the loader is the handler for the system call codice_1. The Unix loader&#x27;s tasks include:

# validation (permissions, memory requirements etc.);
# memory-mapping the executable object from the disk into main memory;
# copying the command-line arguments into virtual memory;
# initializing registers (e.g., the stack pointer);
# jumping to the program entry point (codice_2).

In Microsoft Windows 7 and above, the loader is the codice_3 function contained in ntdll.dll, which does the following:

# initialisation of structures in the DLL itself (i.e. critical sections, module lists);
# validation of executable to load;
# creation of a heap (via the function codice_4);
# allocation of environment variable block and PATH block;
# addition of executable and NTDLL to the module list (a doubly-linked list);
# loading of KERNEL32.DLL to obtain several important functions, for instance codice_5;
# loading of executable&#x27;s imports (i.e. dynamic-link libraries) recursively (check the imports&#x27; imports, their imports and so on);
# in debug mode, raising of system breakpoint;
# initialisation of DLLs;
# garbage collection;
# calling codice_6 on the context parameter given to the loader function (i.e. jumping to codice_7, that will start the executable)

Some operating systems need relocating loaders, which adjust addresses (pointers) in the executable to compensate for variations in the address at which loading starts. The operating systems that need relocating loaders are those in which a program is not always loaded into the same location in the (virtual) address space and in which pointers are absolute addresses rather than offsets from the program&#x27;s base address. Some well-known examples are IBM&#x27;s OS/360 for their System/360 mainframes, and its descendants, including z/OS for the z/Architecture mainframes.

===OS/360 and derivatives===
In OS/360 and descendant systems, the (privileged) operating system facility is called IEWFETCH, and is an internal component of the OS Supervisor, whereas the (non-privileged) LOADER application can perform many of the same functions, plus those of the Linkage Editor, and is entirely external to the OS Supervisor (although it certainly uses many Supervisor services).

IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized channel programs, and it is theoretically possible to load and to relocate an entire executable within one revolution of the DASD media (about 16.6 ms maximum, 8.3 ms average, on &quot;legacy&quot; 3,600 rpm drives). For load modules which exceed a track in size, it is also possible to load and to relocate the entire module without losing a revolution of the media.

IEWFETCH also incorporates facilities for so-called overlay structures, and which facilitates running potentially very large executables in a minimum memory model (as small as 44 KB on some versions of the OS, but 88 KB and 128 KB are more common).

The OS&#x27;s nucleus (the always resident portion of the Supervisor) itself is formatted in a way that is compatible with a stripped-down version of IEWFETCH. Unlike normal executables, the OS&#x27;s nucleus is &quot;scatter loaded&quot;: parts of the nucleus are loaded into different portions of memory; in particular, certain system tables are required to reside below the initial 64 KB, while other tables and code may reside elsewhere.

The system&#x27;s Linkage Editor application is named IEWL. IEWL&#x27;s main function is to associate load modules (executable programs) and object modules (the output from, say, assemblers and compilers), including &quot;automatic calls&quot; to libraries (high-level language &quot;built-in functions&quot;), into a format which may be most efficiently loaded by IEWFETCH. There are a large number of editing options, but for a conventional application only a few of these are commonly employed.

The load module format includes an initial &quot;text record&quot;, followed immediately by the &quot;relocation and/or control record&quot; for that text record, followed by more instances of text record and relocation and/or control record pairs, until the end of the module.

The text records are usually very large; the relocation and/or control records are small as IEWFETCH&#x27;s three relocation and/or control record buffers are fixed at 260 bytes (smaller relocation and/or control records are certainly possible, but 260 bytes is the maximum possible, and IEWL ensures that this limitation is complied with, by inserting additional relocation records, as required, before the next text record, if necessary; in this special case, the sequence of records may be: ..., text record, relocation record, ..., control record, text record, ...).

A special byte within the relocation and/or control record buffer is used as a &quot;disabled bit spin&quot; communication area, and is initialized to a unique value. The Read CCW for that relocation and/or control record has the Program Controlled Interrupt bit set. The processor is thereby notified when that CCW has been accessed by the channel via a special IOS exit. At this point the processor enters the &quot;disabled bit spin&quot; loop (sometimes called &quot;the shortest loop in the world&quot;). Once that byte changes from its initialized value, the CPU exits the bit spin, and relocation occurs, during the &quot;gap&quot; within the media between the relocation and/or control record and the next text record. If relocation is finished before the next record, the NOP CCW following the Read will be changed to a TIC, and loading and relocating will proceed using the next buffer; if not, then the channel will stop at the NOP CCW, until it is restarted by IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit. The three buffers are in a continuous circular queue, each pointing to its next, and the last pointing to the first, and three buffers are constantly reused as loading and relocating proceeds.

IEWFETCH can, thereby, load and relocate a load module of any practical size, and in the minimum possible time.

==Dynamic linkers==
Dynamic linking loaders are another type of loader that load and link shared libraries (like .so files, .dll files or .dylib files) to already loaded running programs.

Where such shared libraries can be shared by multiple processes, with only one single copy of the shared code possibly appearing at a different (virtual) address in each process&#x27;s address space, the code in the shared library is required to be relocatable, ie the library must only use self-relative or code segment base-relative internal addresses throughout. Some processor have instructions that can use self-relative code-references in order to facilitate this.

<text>A loader is a heavy equipment machine used in construction to move or load materials such as soil, rock, sand, demolition debris, etc. into or onto another type of machinery (such as a dump truck, conveyor belt, feed-hopper, or railroad car).

There are many types of loader, which, depending on design and application, are variously called a bucket loader, end loader, front loader, front-end loader, payloader, high lift, scoop, shovel dozer, [[skid-steer]], skip loader, tractor loader or wheel loader.

==Description==
A loader is a type of tractor, usually wheeled, sometimes on tracks, that has a front-mounted wide bucket connected to the end of two booms (arms) to scoop up loose material from the ground, such as dirt, sand or gravel, and move it from one place to another without pushing the material across the ground. A loader is commonly used to move a stockpiled material from ground level and deposit it into an awaiting dump truck or into an open trench excavation.

The loader assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools—for example, many can mount forks to lift heavy pallets or shipping containers, and a hydraulically opening &quot;clamshell&quot; bucket allows a loader to act as a light dozer or scraper. The bucket can also be augmented with devices like a bale grappler for handling large bales of hay or straw.

Large loaders, such as the Kawasaki 95ZV-2, John Deere 844K, ACR 700K Compact Wheel Loader, Caterpillar 950H, Volvo L120E, Case 921E, or Hitachi ZW310 usually have only a front bucket and are called front loaders, whereas small loader tractors are often also equipped with a small backhoe and are called backhoe loaders or loader backhoes or JCBs, after the company that first claimed to have invented them. Other companies like CASE in America and Whitlock in the UK had been manufacturing excavator loaders well before JCB.

The largest loader in the world is LeTourneau L-2350. Currently these large loaders are in production in the Longview, Texas facility. The L-2350 uses a diesel-electric propulsion system similar to that used in a locomotive. Each rubber tired wheel is driven by its own independent electric motor.
Loaders are used mainly for loading materials into trucks, laying pipe, clearing rubble, and digging. A loader is not the most efficient machine for digging as it cannot dig very deep below the level of its wheels, like a backhoe or an excavator can. The capacity of a loader bucket can be anywhere from 0.5 to 36 m3 depending upon the size of the machine and its application. The front loader&#x27;s bucket capacity is generally much bigger than a bucket capacity of a backhoe loader.

Unlike most bulldozers, most loaders are wheeled and not tracked, although track loaders are common. They are successful where sharp-edged materials in construction debris would damage rubber wheels, or where the ground is soft and muddy. Wheels provide better mobility and speed and do not damage paved roads as much as tracks, but provide less traction.

In construction areas loaders are also used to transport building materials such as bricks, pipe, metal bars, and digging tools over short distances.

Front-loaders are commonly used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snow basket, which can also be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck.

High-tip buckets are suitable for light materials such as chip, peat and light gravel and when the bucket is emptied from a height.

Unlike backhoes or standard tractors fitted with a front bucket, many large loaders do not use automotive steering mechanisms. Instead, they steer by a hydraulically actuated pivot point set exactly between the front and rear axles. This is referred to as &quot;articulated steering&quot; and allows the front axle to be solid, allowing it to carry greater weight. Articulated steering provides better maneuverability for a given wheelbase. Since the front wheels and attachment rotate on the same axis, the operator is able to &quot;steer&quot; his load in an arc after positioning the machine, which can be useful. The tradeoff is that when the machine is &quot;twisted&quot; to one side and a heavy load is lifted high, it has a greater risk of turning over to the &quot;wide&quot; side.
Front loaders gained popularity during the last two decades, especially in urban engineering projects and small earthmoving works. Heavy equipment manufacturers offer a wide range of loader sizes and duties.

The term &quot;loader&quot; is also used in the debris removal field to describe the boom on a grapple truck.

== Major components ==
The major components included in a loader are the engine (diesel in almost all cases), the hydraulic components (such as pumps, motors and valves) and the transmission components (gearbox, axles, wheels/tracks, pumps, motors, etc.). The engine runs both the hydraulics and the transmission, and these in turn move the front attachment (a bucket, forks, sweeper, etc.) to manipulate the material being handled, and the wheels or tracks to move the machine around the jobsite.

==Wheel loaders==
The first wheel loader was invented by Frank G. Hough in 1939, it was called the Payloader. This machine consisted of a vertical mast affixed to the front of a tractor with a pair of loader arms running from the back of the machine ending in a forwards bucket, with the main lifting mechanism being driven a cable tensioned via vertically lifting hydraulic cylinder located inside the mast. Today wheel loaders are articulated, a design choice introduced in 1953 via Mixermobile&#x27;s Scoopmobile series of wheel loaders. This articulation allows them both a superior turning radius and the ability to move the bucket in a small horizontal arc without having to move forward like a conventionally steering chassis.

=== Armored wheel loaders ===

The Israeli Combat Engineering Corps uses armored Caterpillar 966 wheel loaders for construction and combat engineering missions in militarily occupied territories such as the West Bank. They are often seen building or removing road blocks and building bases and fortifications. Since 2005, they have also been used to demolish small houses. The Israel Defense Forces added armor plating to the loader to protect it against rocks, stones, molotov cocktails, and light gunfire.

Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s police elite squad Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (BOPE) has acquired one wheel loader designed for military use to open routes and make way for the police in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s slums, which are controlled, and blocked, by drug dealers.

Several if not most countries have similar equipment. The Dutch armed forces for instance use models like the Werklust WG18Edef, which weighs 15 tons, 2 more than the corresponding unarmored civilian model. In addition, the Dutch military previously used extra armor modules covering most of the window surface with steel for extra protection. These were however not popular with the crews due to low visibility.

The Turkish Army and Turkish Police use remote controlled armored wheel loader Tosun during the building of the Syria–Turkey barrier, the Operation Euphrates Shield, Operation Idlib Shield) and Operation Olive Branch.

==Tractor front loaders==

These loaders are a popular addition to tractors from . Its current &#x27;drive-in&#x27; form was originally designed and developed in 1958 by a Swedish company named Ålö when they launched their Quicke loader. Tractor loaders were developed to perform a multitude of farming tasks, and are popular due to their relatively low cost (compared to Telehandler) and high versatility. Tractor loaders can be fitted with many attachments such as hydraulic grabs and spikes to assist with bale and silage handling, forks for pallet work, and buckets for more general farm activities. Industrial tractor loaders equipped with box graders are marketed to contractors as skip loaders.

==Compact front end loaders==
Abram Dietrich Thiessen of Eyebrow Saskatchewan in the 1940s built the first quick attach front end loader. 
Front-end loaders (FELs) are popular additions to compact utility tractors and farm tractors. Compact utility tractors, also called CUTs, are small tractors, typically with and used primarily for grounds maintenance and landscape chores. There are 2 primary designs of compact tractor FELs, the traditional dogleg designed style and the curved arm style.

John Deere manufactures a semi-curved loader design that does not feature the one piece curved arm, but also is not of the traditional two piece design. New Holland introduced a compact loader with a one piece curved arm on its compact utility tractors, similar one piece curved arm loaders are now available on compact tractors on many brands including Case IH/Farmall, and some Montana and Kioti tractors. Kubota markets traditional loader designs on most of its compact tractors but now features a semi-curved loader design similar to the John Deere loader design on several of its small tractors.

While the front-end loaders on CUT size tractors are capable of many tasks, given their relatively small size and low capacities when compared to commercial loaders, the compact loaders can be made more useful with some simple options. A &quot;toothbar&quot; is commonly added to the front edge of a loader bucket to aid with digging. Some loaders are equipped with a quick coupler, otherwise known as a &quot;quick attach&quot; &quot;(QA)&quot; system. The &quot;QA&quot; system allows the bucket to be removed easily and other tools to be added in its place. Common additions include a set of &quot;pallet forks&quot; for lifting pallets of goods or a &quot;bale spear&quot; for lifting hay bales.

LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine) is also a front end loader but meant to be used for mine compact conditions, can handle various range of loads with varying size of buckets, and can be driven with electric motors as well as diesel engines.

== Skid loaders and track loaders ==

A skid loader is a small loader utilizing four wheels with hydraulic drive that directs power to either, or both, sides of the vehicle. Very similar in appearance and design is the track loader, which utilizes a continuous track on either side of the vehicle instead of the wheels. Since the expiration of Bobcat&#x27;s patent on its quick-connect system, newer tractor models are standardizing that popular format for front end attachments.

== Swingloaders ==
A swingloader is a rigid frame loader with a swinging boom. The Swingloader was invented in 1953 by German manufacturer Ahlmann with the AR1 model. The boom can swing 180 degrees or more. The loader is able to lift on all sides and dump off on all sides. Swingloaders are often used by the railroad industry to lay rail. Like other loaders many attachments can be attached to the boom such as magnets, forks, and buckets. Smaller swingloaders can be used in farming applications for loading out. A swinging boom is advantageous where space is limited as stability, mobility and space management are greatly increased over their articulated counterparts.

<text>The Computer Music Center (CMC) at Columbia University is the oldest center for electronic and computer music research in the United States. It was founded in the 1950s as the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

== Location ==
The CMC is housed in Prentis Hall, 632 West 125th Street, New York City, across the street from Columbia&#x27;s 17-acre Manhattanville campus. The facility consists of a large graduate research facility specializing in computer music and multimedia research, as well as composition and recording studios for student use. Projects to come out of the CMC since the 1990s include:

* ArtBots
* dorkbot
* PeRColate
* Real-Time Cmix

The director of the CMC is Seth Cluett, and the CMC offers classes taught by George E. Lewis, Seth Cluett, David Soldier, Anna Meadors, and Ben Holtzman, as well as visiting faculty who give seminars every year. In collaboration with the Visual Arts Program in the Columbia University School of the Arts, the Computer Music Center offers a Sound Art MFA Program directed by Miya Masaoka. The program was founded in 2014 by Douglas Repetto who served as Director until 2016.

==History==
The forerunner of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center was a studio founded in the early 1950s by Columbia University professors Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, and Princeton University professors Milton Babbitt and Roger Sessions. Originally concerned with experiments in music composition involving the new technology of reel-to-reel tape, the studio soon branched out into all areas of electronic music research. The center was officially established with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1959 which was used to finance the acquisition of the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer from its owner, RCA.
The center&#x27;s flagship piece of equipment, the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, was delivered in 1957 after it was developed to Ussachevsky and Babbitt&#x27;s specifications. The RCA (and the center) were re-housed in Prentis Hall, a building off the main Columbia campus on 125th Street. Significant pieces of electronic music realized on the Synthesizer included Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Vision and Prayer&quot; and Charles Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;Time&#x27;s Encomium&quot;, which was awarded the 1970 Pulitzer Prize in Music. In 1964 Columbia Records released an album titled simply &quot;Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center&quot;, which was produced principally on the RCA synthesizer.
Most of the luminaries in the field of electronic music (and avant-garde music in general) visited, worked, or studied at the Electronic Music Center, including Edgard Varèse, Chou Wen-chung, Halim El-Dabh, Michiko Toyama, Bülent Arel, Mario Davidovsky, Charles Dodge, Pril Smiley, Alice Shields, Wendy Carlos, Dariush Dolat-Shahi, Kenjiro Ezaki and Luciano Berio. The center also acted as a consulting agency for other electronic music studios in the Western Hemisphere, giving them advice on optimum studio design and helping them purchase equipment.

The staff engineers at the center under Peter Mauzey developed customized equipment to solve the needs of the composers working at the center. These include early prototypes of tape delay machines, quadraphonic mixing consoles, and analog triggers designed to facilitate interoperability between other (often custom-made) synthesizer equipment. The center also had a large collection of Buchla, Moog, and Serge Modular synthesizers.

By the late 1970s the Electronic Music Center was rapidly nearing obsolescence as its classical analog tape techniques were being surpassed by parallel work in the field of computer music. By the mid-1980s the Columbia and Princeton facilities had ceased their formal affiliation, with the Princeton music department strengthening its affiliation with Bell Labs and founding a computer music studio under Godfrey Winham and Paul Lansky (see Princeton Sound Lab).

The original Columbia facility was re-organized in 1995 under the leadership of Brad Garton and was renamed the Columbia University Computer Music Center. Garton served as Director from 1995 until 2021, when Seth Cluett became Director joined by Anna Meadors as Assistant Director.

<text>Woodrow Stanley Lloyd (July 16, 1913 – April 7, 1972) was a Canadian politician and educator who served as the 8th premier of Saskatchewan from 1961 to 1964. Born in Saskatchewan in 1913, he became a teacher in the early 1930s. He worked as a teacher and school principal and was involved with the Saskatchewan Teachers&#x27; Federation, eventually becoming its president.

He was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1944. He became an instrumental figure in Tommy Douglas&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government between 1944 and 1961, serving as Education Minister and then Treasurer. He succeeded Douglas as Saskatchewan Premier in late 1961. In that role, Lloyd piloted Canada&#x27;s first Medicare program from legislation to implementation, including resolving the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike.

Lloyd&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1964 provincial election and he served the next six years as the Leader of the Official Opposition. He stepped down as party leader in 1970, and from the Legislature in 1971. Lloyd was appointed to a United Nations post in South Korea, where he died of a heart attack in 1972.

==Early life and career==
Lloyd was born in Webb, Saskatchewan on July 16, 1913. He initially studied engineering, but after the onset of the Great Depression, switched his studies to teaching and graduated with a teaching degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1936. He started teaching school that year, and eventually became a school principal in the early 1940s at Stewart Valley, Vanguard, and Biggar. Lloyd was also active in the Saskatchewan Teachers&#x27; Federation and held many positions in the organization including the presidency from 1940 to 1944. He also served on the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Senate, and was the president of the Saskatchewan Educational Conference in the early 1940s.

== Political career ==

=== Douglas government (1944–61) ===
In the 1944 provincial election, Lloyd was elected to the Saskatchewan Legislature as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member for the constituency of Biggar, a seat that he went on to hold until his retirement in 1971. The 1944 election brought the CCF to power for the first time with the party promising to invest in social security and economic development. Lloyd became the youngest cabinet minister in Saskatchewan history when he was appointed Minister of Education by Premier Tommy Douglas. Lloyd served in that role for the next sixteen years and oversaw the complete overhaul of the Saskatchewan education system. The most controversial measure he introduced was the amalgamation of thousands of local school boards into 56 larger school units in 1944–45. The measure was instituted to create more equitable educational opportunities for students across the province by providing students greater opportunity to receive instruction by specialized teachers and access to increased education resources, including provincial grants. However, the move was opposed by some rural residents who resented the loss of local control over schools, as the move to larger units resulted in the closure of nearly all rural one-room schools over the next two decades. The transformation has been called &quot;the most revolutionary revision to the province&#x27;s education system since the creation of the province&quot;, and it helped lead to increased school attendance across all age groups. In addition to school reform, Lloyd led the implementation of a regional library system for the province.

After the 1960 election—which resulted in the fifth consecutive CCF majority government—Douglas appointed Lloyd to be the provincial treasurer. The 1960 election was largely seen as a referendum on public healthcare, which the CCF had promised to implement. After the CCF victory, In 1961, Douglas resigned as premier to assume the leadership of the newly-formed federal New Democratic Party (NDP). Lloyd was elected as Douglas&#x27; successor for what was now called the Saskatchewan CCF-NDP, defeating Olaf Turnbull. This made Lloyd the first premier of Saskatchewan to have been born in the province after its accession to Confederation in 1905.

=== Premier of Saskatchewan (1961–64) ===
As Premier, Lloyd was responsible for implementing the universal health care plan that had been introduced under Douglas. Lloyd&#x27;s biggest obstacle was the July 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike, when the province&#x27;s physicians withdrew service in an attempt to defeat the Medicare initiative. Lloyd and his government refused to back down on the concept of a universal public health care system and persuaded the doctors to settle after 23 days. After updated legislation was passed, &quot;Maclean&quot;&#x27;s named Lloyd an &quot;outstanding citizen&quot;.

In 1963, Lloyd&#x27;s government created the Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation to partner with private industry in research and development.

Although Medicare was successfully implemented—and would be implemented across the country in the years that followed—the political turmoil did lasting damage to the CCF government, which by 1964 and had been in power for twenty years. Ross Thatcher&#x27;s Liberal Party took advantage of a mood for change and worked to limit competition between free-enterprise candidates in the 1964 provincial election; although the popular vote was a virtual tie between Lloyd&#x27;s party and Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals, the Liberals won a narrow majority government, which was only confirmed after a number of recounts in close ridings.

=== Late political career (1964–71) ===
After the 1964 election, Lloyd became leader of the Opposition. In that role he sought to renew grassroots engagement and party policy, which he felt had begun to stagnate after the long period in power. In 1967, the party fully adopted the NDP name. Thatcher also called a snap election that year; although Lloyd&#x27;s party increased its share of the vote, the Liberals secured a second majority, increasing Lloyd&#x27;s sense of urgency to update the party platform. When the &quot;Waffle&quot; movement—a faction of New Left supporters seeking to return the NDP to its socialist roots and advocating against American imperialism—began making inroads into the NDP at both the federal and provincial level in the late 1960s, it found a supporter in Lloyd, who saw its potential to increase engagement and propose innovative policy. Lloyd voted in support of the movement&#x27;s Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada at the 1969 federal NDP convention. However, the Waffle lost the vote and Lloyd&#x27;s support for the movement and his willingness to open the party to debate proved contentious among the party at home. After a special caucus meeting in 1970 in which Lloyd judged he lacked the support of much of his cabinet, he decided to resign as party leader.

In July 1970, Allan Blakeney, who had served as Minister of Health under Lloyd, was elected as the new NDP leader. Lloyd opted not to run in the 1971 election, which saw Blakeney guide the NDP back to a majority government on a rejuvenated platform that incorporated elements of Waffle policy and promised a return to the interventionist approach of the CCF.

==After politics==
Upon Lloyd&#x27;s retirement, Tommy Douglas stated that Lloyd had been &quot;the conscience of the government and the conscience of the party.&quot; In 1971, Lloyd was appointed as representative for the United Nations Development Program in South Korea. However, in 1972, just months after assuming that post, he died suddenly in Seoul.

<doc id="483799" wikidata="Q3990890" url="?curid=483799" title="Throb (TV series)">
<text>Throb is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 6, 1986, to May 21, 1988. The series, created by Fredi Towbin, was produced by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions in association with Taft Entertainment Television, and was distributed by Worldvision Enterprises. The series&#x27; rights are currently held by CBS Media Ventures.

==Synopsis==
The series revolved around a thirty-something divorcee named Sandy Beatty (Diana Canova), who gets a job at a small new wave record label, Throb. Beatty&#x27;s boss is Zachary Armstrong (Jonathan Prince), who had a huge crush on Sandy. Beatty also has a 12-year-old son named Jeremy (played in the first season by Paul Walker and in season two by Sean de Veritch). Beatty&#x27;s best friend was Meredith (Maryedith Burrell), a single teacher who lived in her building, and her co-workers included hip business manager Phil Gaines (Richard Cummings, Jr.) and British-born Prudence Anne Bartlett, who was nicknamed &quot;Blue&quot; (Jane Leeves).

During the second season, Sandy moved from her original apartment to the recently vacated penthouse in her building. She took in her co-worker Blue to help out with rent but the differences between straitlaced, somewhat conservative Sandy and the free-spirited Blue became more pronounced as they both lived and worked together. However, they were still friends.

==Casting==
This show was the first time many American TV viewers saw Jane Leeves, who later gained fame as Daphne Moon on &quot;Frasier&quot;. Paul Walker played Jeremy Beatty for the first season, and would become a leading man in Hollywood some 15 years later, particularly after his breakthrough role in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;.

The creation of the Zachary Armstrong character, and the casting of Jonathan Prince in the role, was inspired by the (then) current rising fame of Michael J. Fox. Prince bore a strong physical resemblance to Fox, and played Zachary with many similar characterizations as Fox&#x27;s &quot;Family Ties&quot; character, Alex P. Keaton. Like Alex Keaton, Zachary was also a young, diminutive overachiever on the fast track who found himself attracted to women who were both older and taller than he, the main object of his affection being Sandy.

<doc id="483800" wikidata="Q1146881" url="?curid=483800" title="La Moneda Palace">
<text>Palacio de La Moneda (, &quot;Palace of the Mint&quot;), or simply La Moneda, is the seat of the president of the Republic of Chile. It also houses the offices of three cabinet ministers: Interior, General Secretariat of the Presidency, and General Secretariat of the Government. Located in downtown Santiago, it occupies an entire block in the Civic District, bordered by Moneda street to the north, Morandé street to the east, Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins to the south, and Teatinos street to the west.

==History==
La Moneda, was the colonial mint house of the city during colonial times, was designed by the Italian architect Joaquín Toesca. Construction began in 1784 and was opened in 1805. The production of coins in Chile took place at La Moneda from 1814 to 1929.

In June 1845 during president Manuel Bulnes&#x27;s administration, the palace became the seat of government and presidential residence. In 1930, a public square—named &quot;Plaza de la Constitución&quot; (&quot;Constitution Square&quot;)—was built in front of the palace. After the presidency of Gabriel González Videla it ceased to serve as a presidential residence.

During the military coup d&#x27;état on September 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force strafed the palace with unguided rockets and automatic cannon fire. The president Salvador Allende died in the palace at this time. Restoration projects of the damage caused were completed in March 1981, although some bullet marks have been preserved and can still be seen today. During the 1973–1980 restorations, an underground office complex (the so-called &quot;bunker&quot;) was built under the front square to provide a safe escape for the dictator Augusto Pinochet in case of an attack.

Under the presidency of Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the palace was painted white. During President Ricardo Lagos&#x27;s administration, the palace&#x27;s inner courtyards were opened to the public during certain hours of the day. Lagos also re-opened Morandé 80—a gate used by Chilean presidents to enter the palace since the early 20th century. It was eliminated during the restoration of the palace as not being in the original plans, but was restored because of the heavy symbolism attached to it as being the gate through which Chilean Presidents entered La Moneda skipping the main&#x27;s gate guard protocol or, in other words, as ordinary citizens of the country. It was also the gate through which the body of President Allende was taken out after the 1973 coup.
A traditional changing of the guard ceremony takes place every two days on odd-numbered days in odd-numbered months, even-numbered days in even-numbered months, including Sundays, at 10 a.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. on weekends (as of June 2015). A formal ceremony dating back to the 1850s, it lasts about 30 minutes and includes a band playing, troops with horses parading into the square, and much pomp and circumstance. The Carabineros de Chile provides the guard unit and band for the ceremony, the guard unit being composed of a Foot Guards battalion and a Horse Guards squadron.

==Architecture==

===Construction===
Joaquín Toesca had worked on many public buildings in colonial Chile, including the Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral, before he was engaged to design the new royal mint that would become the Palacio de la Moneda.

Works on the building started in 1784, with building materials arriving the following year from around Chile and the world: limestone from the Polpaico country estate; sand from the Maipo River; red stones from a quarry at the Cerro San Cristóbal in Santiago; white stone from the neighbouring Cerro Blanco; oak and cypress wood from Valdivia; Spanish metal works from Vizcaya. Twenty varieties of brick were baked in Santiago for the construction of lintels, comers, floors, moldings, and of the solid walls more than a meter thick.

Toesca died in 1799, before seeing his work finished, and military engineer Agustin Cavallero took over the project. The “Mint House of Santiago de Chile” finally opened in 1805.

In 1929, an annex was commissioned the then President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo to give the palace a facade to face the Alameda Avenue, the main street of Santiago. The project was designed by Josué Smith strictly following the design of the original construction. The three-floor annex was built using part of the original construction that was occupied until that date by the mint, which was relocated to a site adjacent to Quinta Normal Park.

In 1940, a former mint pavilion, part of the original design of Toesca, was demolished to make way for the Patio de los Naranjos.

===Architectural style===
The Palacio de la Moneda is built in a pure neoclassical style with Roman Doric influences. The building&#x27;s wide, horizontal shape and rectangular composition conveys strength and stability, according to the palace&#x27;s listing on the UNESCO website. Its main façade faces Moneda street, and its rooms are distributed along the transverse and longitudinal axes forming several patios.

Behind this façade lie three patios: the Patio de los Cañones, which functions as an entrance hall; a covered patio; and finally the Patio de los Naranjos, where presidential ceremonies take place.

The architecture website ARQHYS.com states that the Palacio de la Moneda is “the only structure in the pure Italian neoclassical style that exists in Latin America.” 

The building has been subject to several modifications throughout the years, made by different presidents. The last great restoration of the building was carried out after the 1973 military coup, when large portions of the building were destroyed or damaged.

===Plaza de la Ciudadanía===

To celebrate the bicentenary of Chile&#x27;s independence in 2010, a new public square called the Plaza de la Ciudadanía (‘’Citizenry Square’’ in Spanish) was constructed on the south side of the palace stretching down to the Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins or “Alameda”. Construction began in May 2004 and the plaza was inaugurated in December 2005.

Designed by Undurraga Devés Arquitectos, the Plaza de la Ciudadanía has been called “one of the most important public works in the last century” by Chile&#x27;s Plataforma Arquitectura website. Paths leading down from the plaza give access to the underground Palacio de La Moneda Cultural Center, which hosts a range of exhibitions on Chilean culture and history.

<doc id="483807" wikidata="Q361581" url="?curid=483807" title="Ali Hassan Mwinyi">
<text>Ali Hassan Mwinyi (8 May 1925 – 29 February 2024) was a Tanzanian politician who served as the second president of the United Republic of Tanzania from 1985 to 1995. Previous posts included Minister for Home Affairs and Vice President. He also was chairman of the ruling party, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) from 1990 to 1996.

During Mwinyi&#x27;s terms, Tanzania took the first steps to reverse the socialist policies of Julius Nyerere. He relaxed import restrictions and encouraged private enterprise. It was during his second term that multi-party politics were introduced under pressure for reform from foreign and domestic sources. Often referred to as Mzee Rukhsa (&quot;everything goes&quot;), he pushed for liberalization of morals, beliefs, values (without breaking the law), and the economy.

==Early life==
Mwinyi was born on 8 May 1925 in the village of Kivure, Pwani Region, where he was also raised. He then moved to Zanzibar and got his primary education at Mangapwani Primary School in Mangapwani, Zanzibar West Region. Mwinyi then attended Mikindani Dole Secondary School in Dole, Zanzibar West Region. From 1945 to 1964 he worked successively as a tutor, teacher, and head teacher at various schools before deciding to enter national politics.

Concurrently, Mwinyi earned his General Certificate of Education through correspondence (1950–1954) and then studied for a teaching diploma at the Institute of Education at Durham University in the United Kingdom. He did not leave England until 1962, being appointed principal of Zanzibar Teaching Training College in Zanzibar West Region, upon his return.

==Presidency==
President Julius Nyerere retired in October 1985 and picked Ali Hassan Mwinyi to be his successor. Nyerere remained chairman of the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), until 1990, which would later cause tensions between the government and the party regarding economic reform ideology. When the transition of power took place, Tanzania&#x27;s economy was in the midst of a slump. From 1974 to 1984, the GDP was growing at an average of 2.6% per year while the population was increasing at a faster rate of 3.4% each year. Rural incomes and urban wages had both fallen by the early 1980s, despite Tanzania&#x27;s minimum wage laws. Furthermore, the currency was overpriced, basic goods were scarce, and the country had over three billion dollars of foreign debt. Agricultural production was low, and the general opinion was that Nyerere&#x27;s Ujamaa socialist policies had failed economically.

Such policies included the nationalization of major production, the forced re-villagization of the rural population into communal farms, and the banning of any opposition parties. Nyerere&#x27;s supporters were opposed to involving the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in domestic economic reforms, believing it would cause instability and conflict with their socialist values. Also, Tanzania&#x27;s relationship with the IMF had been strained since Nyerere&#x27;s government failed to meet the loan conditions from a 1980 financial package agreement.

Early in this political transition, many believed that Mwinyi was unlikely to deviate from Nyerere&#x27;s policies since he was viewed as a loyal supporter of his predecessor. He and his followers called for economic and political reform to liberalize the market and review traditional socialist ideologies. He surrounded himself with reformists, even replacing three cabinet members and other ministers who were opposed to change. The prime minister at the time, Joseph Warioba, along with the finance minister Cleopa Msuya were also quite supportive of new policies. During his first address to Tanzania&#x27;s Parliament in 1986, he promised to resume negotiations with the IMF and World Bank, assuming that any resulting agreement would be beneficial to the citizens of Tanzania.

=== Agreements with international financial institutions ===
In 1986, Mwinyi made an agreement with the IMF to receive a $78 million standby loan, which was Tanzania&#x27;s first foreign loan in over six years. Bilateral donors approved this austerity plan and agreed to reschedule Tanzania&#x27;s debt payments. They agreed to do so for a period of five years, requiring that Tanzania pay only 2.5% of their debts in the meantime. In an interview, Mwinyi urged donor countries to use Canada as an example and write off Tanzania&#x27;s debts all together. If this request was not possible, he asked instead for a minimum of ten years to pay off loans, but said that 20 to 25 years was a more ideal range. He predicted that by this time, the country&#x27;s economy would be recovered and they would be in a position to repay their debts without it hurting them. In the same interview, he also asked aid donors for lower interest rates.

Mwinyi claimed that his negotiations with the IMF were on behalf of the people: for example, he agreed to the Fund&#x27;s request that he decrease the number of public institutions, but only when doing so was necessary and could be done gradually. Furthermore, he declined their recommendation to freeze pay raises within the government and to cut free public services.

The following year, Mwinyi negotiated Tanzania&#x27;s first structural adjustment facility (SAF) with the IMF, followed by subsequent agreements in 1988 and again in 1990. In addition to these developments, the World Bank provided structural adjustment credits for reforms in the agricultural, industrial, and financial sectors. In 1989, President Mwinyi began the second phase of his reform program by continuing to liberalise trade and exchange rates and expanding reforms to include reforms in the banking system, agricultural marketing, the parastatal sector, government administration, the civil service and social sectors.

=== Multi-party politics ===
In 1991, the first stages of the transition towards multipartyism began when Mwinyi appointed Chief Justice Francis Nyalali to lead a commission to gauge the amount of popular support for the current single-party system. This commission submitted their report to the President in 1992, recommending that the government transition into a multi-party system. They made this recommendation for 21 percent of the 36,299 Tanzanians who favored this change. Of the 75 percent who supported the current system, 55 percent were in favor of some sort of reform. Justice Nyalali pointed to 20 specific laws that were in need of revision in order to comply with the requirements of a multi-party system. Mwinyi supported their recommendation and the CCM Extraordinary National Party Conference ratified changes through constitutional amendments in February 1992. Not all 20 of these laws were revised, including the controversial Preventative Detention Act that was leftover from colonial times.

=== Corruption ===
During the years of Julius Nyerere&#x27;s presidency, corruption was viewed as a sort of oppression that undermined Tanzania&#x27;s egalitarian values. But, reports of corruption increased along with the state&#x27;s economic influence. During Mwinyi&#x27;s presidency, corrupt practices worsened under his economically liberal policies. It became so endemic that some donors froze aid in 1994 in response. During Tanazania&#x27;s multi-party election in 1995, the opposition parties used the people&#x27;s resentments towards the ongoing corruption as political fuel. The CCM candidate Benjamin Mkapa was also able to use corruption in his favor, as he was viewed as untainted by any of the corruption scandals that marred the Mwinyi administration.

==== 1993 Chavda scandal ====
Brothers and businessmen V.G. Chavda and P.G. Chavda received a $3.5 million loan from a debt conversion program (DCP) in 1993. They promised to use these funds to revamp rundown plantations in the Tanga Region. This included upgrading worker housing, repairing old machines, and replanting farmland. They claimed their projects would create 1,400 jobs and would generate $42 million in foreign exchange money. In reality, they had diverted the funds outside of the country through the purchase of fake machines and parts. It was later uncovered that high-ranking politicians had covered for them, including the Minister for Home Affairs, Augustine Mrema. They were able to evade prosecution.

==== Mohamed Enterprises ====
In early 1995, the well-known company Mohamed Enterprises was accused of allegedly distributing food that was unfit for consumption. Augustino Mrema claimed he would punish the company, but was demoted to Minister of Youth and Culture before he could take action. He criticized Mwinyi&#x27;s administration for tolerating high levels of corruption and being complicit about anti-corruption enforcement. He was then removed from the cabinet, and later became a candidate for one of the opposition parties, NCCR-Mageuzi.

=== Views on apartheid ===
In a 1989 interview when asked about his views regarding apartheid, Mwinyi advocated for tough, comprehensive sanctions to be carried out against South Africa. He also called for Western nations to assist &quot;frontline states&quot; in dealing with any destabilization attempts made by the South African government against those who oppose them. He said that practicing these measures concurrently would help to dismantle apartheid. He called the Reagan administration&#x27;s hesitance to enact tougher sanctions a &quot;stumbling block&quot;, and expressed his hope that future U.S. leaders would take more action against South Africa&#x27;s regime.

==Personal life and death==
Ali Hassan Mwinyi married Siti Mwinyi in 1960, with whom he had six sons and six daughters. In retirement, he stayed out of the limelight and continued to live in Dar es Salaam. He released his memoir, &quot;Mzee Rukhsa: The Journey of My Life&quot;, in 2021.

In November 2023, Mwinyi was hospitalized for a chest illness. He died of lung cancer at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam, on 29 February 2024, at the age of 98.

<text>The &quot;Nevada&quot; class comprised two dreadnought battleships— and —built for the United States Navy in the 1910s. They were significant developments in battleship design, being the first in the world to adopt &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor, a major step forward in armor protection because it emphasized protection optimized for long-range engagements before the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the need for such a layout. They also introduced three-gun turrets and oil-fired water-tube boilers to the US fleet. The two &quot;Nevada&quot;s were the progenitors of the standard-type battleship, a group that included the next four classes of broadly similar battleships that were intended to be tactically homogeneous.

&quot;Nevada&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; deployed to Ireland in 1918 to escort convoys during World War I but saw no action. After the war, they were transferred to the Pacific Fleet, where they spent most of the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, they conducted extensive training operations and made several long-distance cruises, including to Australia and New Zealand in 1925 and &quot;Oklahoma&quot;″s voyage to Europe in 1936. Both vessels were extensively modernized between 1927 and 1930, having their armament improved, protection scheme strengthened, and new boilers installed. They were moored in Battleship Row in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on 7 December 1941; &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was sunk in the attack while &quot;Nevada&quot; was able to get underway before being forced to ground herself to avoid sinking in deeper water.

Only &quot;Nevada&quot; was salvageable, and she was repaired and modernized by mid-1943 when she joined the Aleutian Islands campaign. She then supported the Normandy landings in June 1944 and Operation Dragoon in August before returning to the Pacific in time for the Battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945, followed by the Battle of Okinawa from March to June. Worn out by the end of the war, she was allocated to Operation Crossroads in late 1945 for use in the nuclear weapons tests in mid-1946. She survived both of the Crossroads blasts and was ultimately sunk with conventional weapons off Hawaii in 1948. &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, meanwhile, was raised over the course of 1943, partially dismantled in 1944, and sold to ship breakers in 1946. While under tow to San Francisco in May 1947, she became separated from the vessel towing her and foundered.

==Development==

The design of the &quot;Nevada&quot; class took place in the context of strong political opposition to the continual growth (and thus increases in cost) of battleship building that had accelerated with the development of the dreadnought type. In the early 1900s, the Navy had settled on a program of two new battleships per year, a plan approved by President Theodore Roosevelt, but beginning in 1904, Congress began to reject the Navy&#x27;s requests, frequently authorizing only one ship per year, and at times, no new vessels. William Howard Taft, Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, attempted to pressure Congress to build more ships, but had little success, though he did secure a pair of ships for Fiscal Year 1912, which would become the &quot;Nevada&quot; class. Woodrow Wilson, who was elected in 1912, opposed what he saw as excessive naval spending and his Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, blocked proposals from the General Board for larger, more powerful ships as part of an effort to return to two vessels per year. The resulting stabilization of designs produced the standard-type battleship, of which the two &quot;Nevada&quot;s were the first.

===Initial design===

The General Board was not satisfied with the adoption of 5 and 6 twin-gun turrets in earlier dreadnoughts and so requested the next ship be equipped with three-gun turrets. Three-gun turrets would provide a main battery of twelve guns, two more than the preceding , but with four turrets instead of five. Design work on the ships that would be authorized for FY1912 had begun in 1910, with the first sketch prepared by the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) in May that was based on the preceding &quot;New York&quot;s. The aft superfiring No. 4 turret was removed, the amidships No. 3 turret was moved up to superfire over what had been No. 5 turret in an arrangement similar to contemporary British battlecruisers. It was a complicated arrangement that required an ammunition magazine to separate the engine and boiler rooms; the naval historian Norman Friedman suggests it may have been adopted to reduce the concentration of weight aft, which would have put greater stress on the hull and thus required significant strengthening of the hull structure. The ship would also carry four torpedo tubes and a secondary battery of seventeen guns, while belt armor was to be thick.

By this time, the Navy had come to the conclusion that naval engagements would be fought at very long range, and primarily with armor-piercing shells (AP) instead of high-explosive shells, since the latter would be defeated by even medium armor, and at long range, there was no ability to aim specifically at unarmored portions of ships. And because AP shells would easily perforate medium armor plate, only the thickest possible protection should be carried. Another important development that resulted from the assumption of long battle ranges was the adoption of thick deck armor. This was necessitated by the trajectory of the projectiles; as range increased significantly, the angle of impact increased, and thus shells would tend to strike the horizontal deck, not the heavily armored sides, an effect known as plunging fire. The result was the &quot;all or nothing&quot; principle of armor protection, which reserved armor protection only for the ship&#x27;s vitals, including magazines, propulsion machinery spaces, and command spaces. The arrangement was made watertight to create an armored raft that contained enough reserve buoyancy to keep the ship afloat even if the unarmored ends were completely flooded. The &quot;Nevada&quot; design was the first of any navy to introduce the concept.

In June, the Board sent a set of requirements to C&amp;R that incorporated the twelve-gun battery already projected, a minimum speed of , and an armor layout based on the &quot;all or nothing&quot; concept. The engineers at C&amp;R noted that the armor deck would considerably strengthen the hull, but pointed out that the 11-inch belt of the original design would be wholly insufficient to defeat the latest main guns in foreign navies. The Board suggested the addition of a splinter bulkhead behind the belt, which would contain shell fragments. In late 1910, before a final design was accepted, the Navy had to submit estimates for FY1912 to be voted on by Congress in 1911; they used figures based on the &quot;New York&quot;s, which were accepted by Congress, and in turn limited the size of the new ships to a displacement of around ; this was too low for C&amp;R&#x27;s existing proposals, necessitating a redesign. By this time, the first generation of American dreadnoughts had begun to enter service, so experiences operating them could be incorporated into the redesign.

===Redesign and approval===

The first major change was the arrangement of the aft pair of turrets. The amidships magazine of the battleship had difficulty remaining cool, as it was adjacent to the boiler room and the steam lines for the propulsion system ran alongside it. Since the thicker deck increased hull strength, the initial arrangement proposed for &quot;Nevada&quot; could be abandoned in favor of a closely spaced superfiring pair. This shortened the length of hull that required armor protection, and thus reduced displacement. Experience with &quot;Delaware&quot;″s propulsion system—which mixed coal and oil fired boilers—provided the next improvement: boilers that were exclusively oil fired. These would confer a number of advantages, including the ability to refuel at sea, a significant reduction in boiler room crews, greater fuel efficiency, and more compact boiler rooms, among others. Again, the smaller boiler rooms shortened the length of armor necessary to protect the vitals. C&amp;R was not convinced, since coal bunkers had been used to reinforce the side armor, but the Board approved the change in November 1910. Even by that time, the engineers at C&amp;R continued to lobby for their original design based on the &quot;New York&quot; class, but the Board refused to entertain the proposal. Next, the Board decided to return to steam turbines rather than triple-expansion engines, as they believed the greater efficiency of fuel oil would allow the notoriously voracious turbines to achieve the long cruising radius necessary for operations in the Pacific Ocean.

C&amp;R submitted its next proposal on 13 February 1911; it generally aligned with the Board&#x27;s ideas for the armor layout, but it retained some medium armor to protect the secondary guns and it incorporated triple-expansion machinery (though they noted that the engine rooms could accommodate Curtis turbines). The Board rejected it, leading the designers to remove the medium armor, producing a series of studies with speeds of , , and 21 knots and main batteries that ranged from eight to twelve guns. During this period, on 4 March, Congress authorized a pair of ships, designated BB-36 and BB-37 for FY1912. With the ships now authorized, the Board selected one of the ten-gun, 20.5-knot variations on 30 March, which had a belt that was increased to 14 in but included a series of tapers at the top and bottom edge to save weight. The Bureau of Ordnance pointed out that the belt could not be manufactured in a single strake with the tapers, so a joint between upper and lower strakes—a design weakness the engineers had been attempting to avoid—would have to be used. The problem was resolved in July, when C&amp;R proposed removing the 1.5-inch splinter bulkhead in favor of increasing the belt to and incorporating only one taper at the lower edge.

The next issue to address was the triple turret that was the linchpin of the design, since the weight savings made the heavier belt possible and it corrected design defects present in the earlier 5- and 6-turret classes. The US Navy had never built a three-gun turret, and there were concerns that a single hit could disable all three guns, and that three holes in the turret face would weaken the armor too much. C&amp;R suggested conducting firing trials with the old battleship , but nothing came of the proposal. Daniels approved the finalized &quot;Nevada&quot; design on 31 March, without a completed turret design, which was a significant gamble because the turret design might not have been successful. An experimental turret was completed in August 1912, proving the concept, though it required some modifications to reduce shell interference. Since the finalized design adopted a ten-gun battery, only two of the four turrets would be triple mounts, one forward and one aft, with twin-gun turrets superfiring over them.

With the design nearly finalized, the Board began to circulate it with fleet officers for comment; Captain John Hood, who was soon to become a member of the Board, criticized the placement of the secondary battery, as experience with the early dreadnoughts had shown casemate batteries to be completely unusable in all but the calmest seas. The Board pointed out that the increasing range of torpedoes meant that the standard 5-inch /51 caliber guns could not effectively engage destroyers before they launched their weapons, so retaining the weapons at all might not be worthwhile. But there were no suitable alternative, so the Board decided to keep the 5-inch guns as they were. This proved to be the correct decision, as the development of fire-control systems improved the guns&#x27; ability to hit at longer ranges.

==Design==
===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Nevada&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of at normal displacement and at full load. They displaced as designed and fully laden. The ships had a ram bow and a forecastle deck that extended half of the length of the ship. As built, the ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting of a heavily armored conning tower directly aft of the forward main battery turrets. They were completed with two lattice masts fitted with spotting tops to assist in directing the main battery, a common feature of American capital ships of the period. They had a crew of 55 officers and 809 enlisted men.

Since the Board expected turbines to achieve greater efficiency, &quot;Nevada&quot; was equipped with a pair of direct-drive Curtis steam turbines, with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Yarrow water-tube boilers. &quot;Nevada&quot; was the first US capital ship to use reduction geared cruising turbines, which could be clutched into the high-pressure turbines to improve fuel economy at low speeds. Geared turbines were fitted in most subsequent US battleships, except those with turbo-electric propulsion. &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, meanwhile, received two vertical triple-expansion engines and twelve oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. &quot;Oklahoma&quot;″s reciprocating engines were prone to excessive vibration, prompting the Navy to consider converting her to double-acting, two-stroke diesel engines in 1925, but the great weight of diesels at the time led to the idea being abandoned. Both ships&#x27; boilers were ducted into a single funnel located amidships.

&quot;Nevada&quot;″s engines were rated at , while those of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; were projected to produce . Both ships had a designed top speed of 20.5 knots, though &quot;Nevada&quot; reached from on speed trials upon completion. Their designed endurance was at a speed of . Under service conditions, &quot;Nevada&quot; was found to have an endurance of at a speed of , which fell considerably at to . With a freshly-cleaned hull, these figures improved slightly, to and , respectively. &quot;Nevada&quot; had a tactical diameter—the distance it took to turn the ship 180 degrees—of at and at . The only figure available for &quot;Oklahoma&quot; is her high-speed turning circle: at .

===Armament===

The &quot;Nevada&quot;s were equipped a main battery of ten 14-inch /45 caliber Mark III guns mounted in two twin and two triple turrets. To save weight and keep the mounts as compact as possible, the triple turrets had all three barrels supported by two trunnions, which required all three guns to be elevated as a unit. Both of the twin turrets had armored rangefinders installed atop their roofs, with a centralized fire control room in the conning tower.

The guns fired a armor-piercing (AP) shell at a muzzle velocity of . Trials with the triple turret revealed excessive dispersion caused by interference between the projectiles while in flight, so a system was adopted to fire each gun individually, separated by a tenth of a second apiece. The turrets allowed elevation to 15 degrees and depression to −5 degrees. At maximum elevation, the guns had a range of about . Two shell hoists serviced all three guns, which were electrically loaded and operated.

For defense against destroyers and torpedo boats, the ships carried a secondary battery of twenty-one 5-inch /51 caliber Mark VIII guns in individual mounts. Twelve of the guns were in casemates in the forecastle deck, six on either side, and another six were in casemates toward the stern at main deck level, with another weapon directly in the stern. These guns proved to be excessively wet in heavy seas and thus were frequently unusable, as experience with earlier vessels had already demonstrated. The last two guns were in open mounts on either side of the conning tower. The guns had a muzzle velocity of firing a shell.

As was customary for capital ships of the period, both vessels were armed with a pair of torpedo tubes submerged below the waterline, one on each broadside. They were supplied with Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes of the Mark VII type; these carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of . &quot;Nevada&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; were the first battleships to carry the Mark 7 torpedoes.

===Armor===

The &quot;Nevada&quot; class was protected by side armor that was 13.5 in thick in the central portion where it protected the ship&#x27;s vitals, the magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. It was wide, of which was below the waterline. At the bottom edge, the belt was reduced to to save weight, relying on the assumption that shells that fell short and passed through the water would be slowed significantly, thus reducing their ability to penetrate heavy armor. On either end of the belt, both sides were connected by a transverse bulkhead that was 8 to thick. The bow and stern were left unarmored. The ships had a armored deck that consisted of special treatment steel (STS) in three layers over the central armored raft; further aft, the deck was increased in thickness to , where it covered the propeller shafts. The armor deck was connected to the top of the belt. One deck below, another layer of armor thick was intended to contain splinters from shells and bombs that were detonated by the upper deck. The sides of the deck sloped down and were increased slightly to thick, and they were connected to the bottom edge of the belt. The lower deck consisted of nickel steel.

The ships&#x27; main battery turrets received very heavy armor protection; the triple turret faces were thick, with sides and 5 in roofs. The twin-gun turrets had slightly thinner protection, consisting of faces and sides. Both turret types had 9 in rears and they rested atop barbettes that were 13 in thick. The conning tower had 16 in sides and a 8 in roof, the latter consisting of STS. The uptakes from the boilers to the funnel were protected by a conical mantlet that was 13 in thick.

===Modifications===
The ships underwent a series of changes over the course of their careers, particularly with regards to their secondary batteries, along with the addition of a tertiary anti-aircraft battery. The first such alteration, the addition of a pair of /50 cal. anti-aircraft guns, was made at the time the ships were completed. In 1918, &quot;Nevada&quot; had her seven aft-most 5-inch guns removed along with the two guns in open mounts; &quot;Oklahoma&quot; had the same reduction in her secondary battery, though she retained the centerline gun in the stern. These were used to arm merchant ships that would have a greater likelihood of encountering a German U-boat on the voyage to Europe. In 1919, both ships received flying-off platforms for aircraft on their superfiring turrets, but these proved to be problematic in service, as they prevented the guns from being fired without destroying the ramps and they severely limited the ability of the guns to be elevated and depressed.

In the late 1920s, both ships were substantially modernized. Both were re-boilered with six Bureau Express boilers that were significantly more efficient than the original twelve boilers. In addition, &quot;Nevada&quot; was re-engined using the turbines that had been installed in in 1917 and removed before the latter was scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Design speed remained the same, but designed horsepower fell slightly to for &quot;Nevada&quot;. She nevertheless achieved on trials, for a top speed of . Fuel capacity was also substantially increased, to normally and for wartime conditions. This increased the ships&#x27; range to at 10 knots and at . The re-boilering saved a considerable amount of weight that was used to increase the deck armor and add torpedo bulges that increased their beam to . Both vessels&#x27; main armor deck was increased in thickness by , bringing the total to 5 inches, though because it consisted of layers, it was not as effective as a single plate of the same thickness.

Both vessels&#x27; armament was significantly improved. The main battery turrets were modified to allow elevation to thirty degrees, which increased their maximum range to . The remaining 5-inch casemates were plated over and the guns were moved a deck higher in an attempt to improve their ability to be used in heavy seas. The eight 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced with an equal number of 5-inch /25 cal. guns, also in individual mounts. In addition, they received eight Browning machine guns. Both vessels had their torpedo tubes removed at this time. Their lattice masts were replaced with more robust tripod masts, and they had a pair of aircraft catapults installed, one of which was placed on the fantail, the other being mounted atop her rear superfiring turret. The alterations increased the ships&#x27; displacement to as designed and a maximum of at full load. The ships&#x27; crews increased to 1,374. At some point in 1941, &quot;Nevada&quot; was fitted with an SC air search radar.

In 1942, during repairs for the damage sustained in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Nevada&quot; was again heavily reconstructed. Her tripod mainmast was removed, along with her heavily armored conning tower, the former to clear up firing arcs for the anti-aircraft weaponry and the latter to save weight for further additions to the anti-aircraft battery. In place of the conning tower and mast, a large bridge structure was installed She had both her 51-cal. and 25-cal. guns removed. They were replaced with battery of sixteen 5-inch /38 cal. Mark 12 dual purpose guns in eight twin gun mounts. Four were mounted on either side of the vessel amidships. The guns fired a shell to a maximum range of or a maximum altitude of at an elevation of 45 degrees. Her light anti-aircraft battery was completely replaced as well; she now carried thirty-six Bofors guns in nine quadruple mounts and thirty-eight Oerlikon autocannon in individual mounts. By the end of the war, she had received an additional quadruple 40 mm mount, while her 20 mm guns were reorganized into five single and twenty twin mounts, for a total of forty-five barrels. Unlike many of the other battleships rebuilt after the attack, &quot;Nevada&quot; did not receive fire-control radar for her main battery, but she was fitted with Mark 37 directors for her new secondary battery.

==Service history==

===Early careers===
After entering service in 1916, both vessels were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. They were occupied with training exercises off the East Coast of the United States into early 1918, by which time the United States had entered World War I on the side of the Allies. Both vessels were sent to Ireland in August 1918 to escort troopship convoys against German warships that might try to break out of the North Sea to intercept them, though no such attacks materialized. Both were present for President Wilson&#x27;s arrival in France to participate in the Versailles Conference at the end of the conflict. After the war, both vessels returned to the Atlantic Fleet, though in 1919, &quot;Nevada&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet; &quot;Oklahoma&quot; joined her there in 1921.

Throughout the 1920s, both ships participated in a yearly routine of training exercises with the rest of the fleet, including shooting practice, tactical training, and annual, large-scale Fleet Problems, the latter providing the basis for the US Navy&#x27;s operations in the Pacific War, and experience that demonstrated that the standard-type battleships were too slow to operate with aircraft carriers led to the development of the fast battleships built in the 1930s. They were also involved in cruises around the Americas and further abroad, such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925. Between 1927 and 1930, both ships were heavily modernized. The standard peacetime routine continued through the 1930s. In 1936, &quot;Oklahoma&quot; embarked on a training cruise to Europe; she was there when the Spanish Civil War broke out that year, and she went to Spain to evacuate Americans in the country.

As tensions with Japan began to rise in the late 1930s over the latter&#x27;s waging of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the United States began to prepare for the increasingly likely prospect of war. In 1940, the Pacific Fleet was transferred from its homeport, San Pedro, California, to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in an effort to deter further aggression. Both ships were at anchor in Battleship Row along Ford Island in December 1941.

===World War II===
On the morning of 7 December 1941, the Japanese aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet launched a surprise attack on the American fleet in Pearl Harbor. &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was struck by three torpedoes early in the attack and quickly began to capsize before receiving six more torpedo hits. As she rolled over, her superstructure prevented her from fully inverting and she came to rest on her port side. Her crew suffered heavy casualties in the sinking, with 20 officers and 395 enlisted men killed. &quot;Nevada&quot; was hit by a single torpedo in her bow early in the attack, but she nevertheless got underway, the only battleship to do so during the attack. She was hit by between six and ten bombs as she moved through the harbor and fears that she might sink in the channel out of Pearl Harbor, thus blocking the port, led her commander to decide to beach the vessel. She suffered relatively minor casualties, with 50 killed and 109 wounded. &quot;Nevada&quot; was refloated in February 1942 and was immediately dry-docked for repairs and modernization, while &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was too seriously damaged to be returned to service; she was righted in 1943 and partially dismantled in 1944 before being sold for scrap in 1946. While being towed from Pearl Harbor to San Francisco on 17 May 1947, she slipped her towing line and sank.

After returning to service in 1943, &quot;Nevada&quot; was primarily used to support amphibious operations. She took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign in April and May, before returning to the United States for further modifications in preparation for her role as a bombardment vessel for the Normandy landings. She steamed to Britain in April 1944 to join the assault fleet, which conducted the landing on 6 June; &quot;Nevada&quot; remained off the beaches for the next eleven days to bombard German positions as the Allied soldiers fought inland, withdrawing only once to replenish ammunition. She and several other vessels from the bombardment force were sent to shell other ports in occupied France, including Cherbourg before being reassigned to the force tasked with supporting Operation Dragoon, the landing in southern France conducted on 15 August. During the landings, she shelled the remnants of the French battleship , scuttled in 1942, and now nothing more than a floating hull, scoring hits that inflicted further damage on the vessel.

&quot;Nevada&quot; then returned to the United States to have her badly-worn barrels relined before returning to the Pacific Fleet. She arrived in the advance base at Ulithi in January 1945 and began preparations for the next major operation, the landing at Iwo Jima the following month. She joined several other battleships for an intensive bombardment of the island for three days before the Marines went ashore on 19 February. The ship operated off the island providing fire support through 7 March, when she departed to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa. The initial bombardment began on 24 March and continued until the landing on 1 April, and &quot;Nevada&quot; remained off the island until 14 April when she was withdrawn for an overhaul. The ship returned for patrols in the East China Sea in July, though she saw no further action before the end of the war on 15 August.

Worn out after nearly thirty years of service by late 1945, she was slated for disposal in nuclear weapons tests in November 1945. She was allocated to the fleet of target ships to be used for Operation Crossroads in January 1946 and she arrived in Bikini Atoll in May. The target fleet included several other battleships, including the captured Japanese vessel . &quot;Nevada&quot; was used as the aiming point for the first test, an air-dropped bomb on 1 July, because the Navy deemed her to be the most resilient of the battleships. The bomb missed the target and inflicted minimal damage. Another test, an underwater blast, was conducted on 24 July, which also failed to sink the ship. She was taken to Pearl Harbor to be examined and was ultimately sunk off Hawaii in conventional weapon tests in 1948.

<text>The &quot;New Mexico&quot; class was a class of three super-dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy in the late 1910s. The class comprised three ships: , the lead ship, , and . Part of the standard series, they were in most respects copies of the s that immediately preceded them, carrying over the same main battery arrangement of twelve guns, but now increased to 50-caliber. They incorporated several other improvements, including a better arrangement of the secondary battery that increased its usability, a clipper bow that improved seakeeping, and an experimental turbo-electric propulsion system adopted on &quot;New Mexico&quot;. Like the other standard-type battleships, they had a top speed of that allowed the fleet to operate as a tactically homogeneous unit.

All three ships spent the bulk of their peacetime careers in the Pacific Fleet; throughout the 1920s and 1930s, they were involved in numerous Fleet Problems, which were large-scale training exercises that helped develop the doctrine later employed during the Pacific War. By 1941, the three ships were moved to the East Coast to join the Neutrality Patrols that protected American merchant ships from German U-boat attacks during the Battle of the Atlantic. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, they were quickly transferred back to the Pacific, though they spent most of 1942 escorting convoys off the west coast of the United States. Beginning in mid-1943, they supported amphibious operations during the Aleutian Islands, Gilbert and Marshall Islands, and the Mariana and Palau Islands Campaigns. The Philippines Campaign followed in late 1944, though &quot;Mississippi&quot; was the only member of the class to participate in the early stages of the campaign, the other vessels being under refit at the time. There, she was present for the Battle of Surigao Strait on 24 October, the last battleship engagement in history.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;New Mexico&quot; took part in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, part of the Philippines Campaign, in early 1945 and both were hit by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. As they were both under repair, only &quot;Idaho&quot; participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima, but all three ships were part of the bombardment force for the Battle of Okinawa, where all were damaged by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. They were present for the occupation of Japan in August and September, thereafter returning to the United States. &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; were quickly decommissioned and sold for scrap, but &quot;Mississippi&quot; remained in service, having been converted into a gunnery testing and training ship. In this capacity, her crew experimented with anti-aircraft missiles in the mid-1950s before the ship was sold to ship breakers in 1956.

==Design==
In the early 1910s, the US Navy began experimenting with guns as other navies began to move to weapons. As development of the new guns progressed, the Navy evaluated a series of proposals for ships incorporating 16-inch guns. The first was a ten-gun ship with five twin-gun turrets that also included improved armor compared to earlier battleships. Additionally, the secondary battery was increased from the standard US armament of guns to weapons. Another smaller version with eight 16-inch guns was also suggested, along with a design mounting the then-standard gun. As work on the new design progressed, the cost of the vessels increased significantly. Compared to the cost of a 14-inch-gunned ship—$12 million—the eight-gun ship was estimated to cost $16.5 million, while the price for the ten-gun ship rose to $19 million.

Even before trials of the new guns had been completed, Rear Admiral Joseph Strauss, then the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd), argued in 1913 that the 16-inch gun was not worth pursuing; he argued that at the expected battle ranges of the day, the 14-inch gun was capable of penetrating heavy armor plate just as effectively and that a ship carrying twelve of those guns had a much better chance of hitting than a ship with eight 16-inch guns. The General Board concurred and instructed the designers to work on the 14-inch ship. Existing turrets for those guns used a single recoil slide for all three guns, which caused concern that a single hit could jam it and thus disable all three guns. Strauss accordingly suggested that the designers at the Bureau of Construction and Repair, under Chief Constructor Richard Watt, incorporate independent slides.

The design staff submitted two proposals on 21 November 1913: a version and a variant. The first incorporated a secondary battery of twenty 6-inch guns, while the smaller one retained twenty-two of the standard 5-inch guns. Weight savings were also achieved by reducing the thickness of the barbette and belt armor by an inch, and reducing fuel capacity. The General Board preferred the larger of the two, citing the heavier armor as needed to defeat the latest 15-inch guns being adopted in foreign battleships and the stronger secondary battery, which they viewed as necessary to ward off long-range torpedo attacks by destroyers. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels disagreed, and on 3 January 1914, rejected the design owing to its higher cost. Instead, he ordered the Navy to accept a repeat of the preceding , which might be fitted with separate slides for the main guns.

Work on the design continued through the year; the designers were concerned that earlier battleships were too &quot;wet&quot; forward, leading to the adoption of a clipper bow to reduce the tendency to ship water in heavy seas. Additionally, experience with existing ships had revealed that the secondary battery, mounted in casemates in the forecastle deck, were effectively unusable in rough sea conditions. The designers therefore moved eighteen of the guns a deck higher and further aft, where they would be less prone to being washed out. Weight savings elsewhere allowed the designers to strengthen the main deck and the transverse bulkhead at either end of the belt. Daniels approved these changes on 2 July, and the following month, BuOrd suggested a newly developed 50-caliber version of 14-inch gun be used, which Watt authorized in September. The longer gun produced a higher muzzle velocity, which allowed the shells to penetrate an additional of armor at . By this time, work on the design stopped, as bids for the contracts were to be submitted starting on 6 October.

Despite the fact that the offer period had opened, one more major change to the design was made. At the time, the standard propulsion system for warships relied on steam turbines to turn propeller shafts, though turbines operated most efficiently at high speed, while the propellers generated thrust most effectively at relatively low speed. One solution to this problem was turbo-electric transmission, which used the turbines to generate electric power that in turn powered electric motors that drove the screws. The Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) recommended the new system on 17 October, pointing out that it would have many advantages over traditional direct-drive systems, including greater fuel economy and lighter and smaller machinery, which could be used to shorten the armored box that protected the ships&#x27; vitals. Also, since the turbines would only need to spin in one direction, simpler machinery without reverse gears could be used. Daniels was convinced, and he approved the change for &quot;New Mexico&quot; on 10 November. Since this was an unproven technology, the other two members of the class received geared turbine systems.

Congress authorized two ships for the class— and —but in mid-1914, the two pre-dreadnoughts were sold to the Greek Navy, and the US Navy was able to use the funds generated by their sale to fund a third member of the class, .

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;New Mexico&quot; class were part of the standard series that began with the ; they featured similar characteristics, including speed, armor, armament, and the use of fuel oil rather than coal. They were designed as such to create a battle fleet of tactically homogeneous ships that would simplify command and control. They were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. Their hulls featured a long forecastle deck that stepped down to main deck level at the main mast. As built, the ships were fitted with two cage masts with spotting tops for the main-gun battery.

Their crew numbered 58 officers and 1,026 enlisted men. Over the course of their careers, their crews expanded significantly as equipment was added. After their early 1930s refit, their crew numbered 82 officers and 1,371 enlisted, and by 1945, wartime improvements brought the crews to 129 officers and 1,850 enlisted. They carried a number of smaller boats for utility purposes while in harbor, as well as to assist with rescue efforts at sea. These included a number of motor launches of various lengths and motor whaleboats.

All three ships were powered by four Curtis turbines, with steam provided by nine oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. &quot;New Mexico&quot;″s turbines were used to power electrical motors that drove the screw propellers; her system was rated for . The latter two ships, used reduction geared cruising turbines, which could be clutched into the high-pressure turbines to improve fuel economy at low speeds. These were rated at . All three vessels were rated for a top speed of . Though the turbo-electric system was effective and it was repeated in the two following classes, the Navy ultimately decided that the system was too heavy and occupied too much space in the hull, and later ships reverted to traditional turbine propulsion.

The ships had storage capacity for of fuel oil for the boilers, though additional spaces in the hull could be used to increase capacity to , which provided a cruising range of at a speed of . As speed increased, their range decreased significantly: at , they could steam for , and at , their range fell to . Moreover, these figures were assuming the vessels had clean hulls free of marine growth that would inhibit their hydrodynamic efficiency. In service conditions where biofouling added drag to the hulls, their ranges were reduced even further to and , respectively.

===Armament===
The ships were armed with a main battery of twelve /50 caliber Mark IV guns in four, three-gun turrets on the centerline, placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts were true three-gun turrets, in that each barrel could elevate independently. They fired a shell with a bursting charge. The guns had a muzzle velocity of . Early in their careers, the &quot;New Mexico&quot;s and the &quot;Tennessee&quot; class experienced excessive dispersion of shot. After extensive testing, it was eventually discovered to have been caused by overly lengthy chambers, which allowed a gap between the shell and the propellant charges. The problem was eventually corrected with the Mark VII gun. The guns were supplied with 100 shells each and they were capable of a rate of fire of about one salvo per minute, as demonstrated by extensive testing with &quot;Idaho&quot; in October 1942.

The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. Initially, the ship was to have been fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which would have been placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding, leaving only the fourteen guns in the superstructure. Of these, ten were located on the forecastle deck and the other four were in open mounts on the shelter deck. Each gun position contained twenty-four rounds of ready-use ammunition, with further munitions stored in the magazines below. The guns were the Mark VIII type, which had a muzzle velocity of firing a shell.

The secondary battery was augmented with four /50 caliber guns in high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defense. The guns fired a shell at a velocity of .

In addition to their gun armament, the &quot;New Mexico&quot;-class ships were also fitted with two torpedo tubes, mounted submerged in the hull, one on each broadside. Both tubes were located in a single torpedo room forward in the hull. Each tube was supplied with a total of six torpedoes, which were Bliss-Leavitt weapons of the Mark VII type; these carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
As was standard for American battleships of the period, the &quot;New Mexico&quot;-class ships relied on the &quot;all or nothing&quot; principle that reserved armor protection only for a ship&#x27;s vitals, creating an armored citadel that had enough reserve buoyancy to keep the vessel afloat even if the unarmored portions of the ship were flooded. The main armored belt was thick, with the thickest armor protecting the ammunition magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces. The transverse bulkheads that capped either end of the belt were the same thickness. The ships had two armored decks; the first, consisted of two layers of special treatment steel (STS) that were thick. Further aft, these were increased to a 1.75 in layer and a layer over the steering compartment. The lower armored deck also consisted of two layers, which were also composed of STS, the first thick and the second 2 in thick.

The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, with thick sides, rears, and 5 in roofs. They rested on barbettes that reduced to 4.5 in below the upper deck, where it was protected by the armored citadel. The conning tower had 16 in thick sides and a roof that consisted of two layers that were each thick.

===Modifications===
The members of the &quot;New Mexico&quot; class received a series of modifications even while under construction, including the already noted alterations to the secondary battery, which was authorized on 7 February 1918 by which time &quot;New Mexico&quot; had been completed with her original twenty-two guns. The other two ships had already had their casemates built into their hulls, so they were simply plated over, unlike the later &quot;Tennessee&quot;s, which had their hulls faired in. Their conning towers were modified with a newly developed bridge arrangement that became standard for all American battleships of the period. It consisted of a fully enclosed navigation bridge on the forward side of the tower, with a large chart house located behind the bridge. Atop the structure was an enclosed torpedo defense station. Starting in 1921, the Navy began installing aircraft catapults on its battleships to allow them to operate floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance and fire observation, and the three &quot;New Mexico&quot;s were among the vessels to receive a Mark II catapult. The ships initially carried Hanriot HD.2 and then Vought UO-1s in the 1920s, which were replaced with Vought O2U Corsairs toward the end of the decade. These, and improved O3U variants served aboard the ships until 1938, when these were replaced with Curtiss SOC Seagulls. Beginning in August 1940, the ships began to receive Vought OS2U Kingfishers.

The three ships were heavily modernized in the early 1930s. Their received an additional 2 in of special treatment steel for their main deck armor, bringing the total thickness to . A second torpedo bulkhead was installed outboard of the original one, and all three ships received anti-torpedo bulges to further enhance their resistance to underwater attack. Both lattice masts were removed; a heavy tower bridge was built in place of the fore mast, and a light pole mast was erected in place of the main mast. During the installation of her new bridge, &quot;Idaho&quot; was fitted out as a flagship, which included the addition of a flag bridge for the admiral and his staff. The ships&#x27; armament was also revised, with the main battery turrets being modified to allow elevation to 30 degrees, greatly extending the range of the guns. Two of the 5-inch guns were removed, and eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. These alterations greatly increased their displacement, to standard and full load. All three ships had their propulsion systems overhauled, receiving new Westinghouse turbines and six BuEng express boilers. Despite the increases in displacement resulting from the additional armor plating and the bulges, the new powerplant increased speed to from . The ships&#x27; crews increased significantly, to 1,443.

Immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (while the &quot;New Mexico&quot;-class ships were in the Atlantic), the ships were docked for improvements to their anti-aircraft armament, receiving a battery of anti-aircraft guns. The ships also had Mark 3 fire-control radars installed. The Navy considered removing their heavily armored conning towers to compensate for the increased weight of the new equipment, but the work could not be accomplished in the eight-week overhaul period that had been scheduled, so they retained their original towers, unlike many of the other older battleships that were rebuilt early in the war. Since many of the American battleships had been sunk or damaged at Pearl Harbor, the three &quot;New Mexico&quot;s were too valuable to be removed from operational status for the necessary amount of time to substantially rebuild them. As a result of these limitations, &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; received a series of rolling changes over the course of late 1942 and into 1943; while at Pearl Harbor in October 1942, they had four of their 5-inch /51 guns removed, along with their directors, to free up space for a pair of quadruple Bofors guns and the shielded tubs for the 1.1-inch guns were converted for use with the 40 mm mounts, though the 1.1-inch guns remained until 1943. Six Oerlikon guns were added as well.

During a refit from 14 October to 28 December 1942, while her sisters received only modest alterations, &quot;Idaho&quot; underwent a more thorough modernization. This consisted of a new anti-aircraft battery of ten quadruple Bofors guns and forty-three Oerlikons, though the Oerlikons were added in stages. By the time the refit ended, she carried only sixteen of them, with eleven more added in January 1943, the remaining sixteen being added in February. The Mark 3 radars were replaced in 1944 by Mark 8 radars aboard &quot;Idaho&quot;, with &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; receiving Mark 28 radars for their light AA armament. Later that year, the ships began to receive Mark 27 backup fire-control radars as well.

From 22 October 1944 to 1 January 1945, &quot;Idaho&quot; received another major refit, which included the installation of ten 5-inch/38 caliber guns in individual, dual-purpose mounts in place of the old 25-caliber guns. She also received new Mark 8 radars for her main battery fire control system. In early 1945, while under repair for combat damage, &quot;Mississippi&quot; also received a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight more of the 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To compensate for the added weight, the ship&#x27;s armored conning tower was removed.

In 1946, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was converted into a gunnery training ship, and for this role she received a new gun battery. No. 1 turret was replaced by a twin 6-inch (152 mm)/47 caliber dual-purpose turret, the same as mounted on the anti-aircraft cruisers. No. 2 and No. 3 main battery turrets were also removed, but No. 4 turret was initially retained. Three twin 5-inch /38 caliber dual-purpose mounts, two single 5-inch/54 caliber dual-purpose mounts (as on the aircraft carriers), two twin 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber mounts, and two 40 mm Bofors quad mounts were installed. In 1952, the last main battery turret was removed and &quot;Mississippi&quot; had two new RIM-2 Terrier missile launchers installed in its place. She later tested the Petrel missile, a radar-homing weapon, in February 1956.

==Ships in class==
==Service history==
===Pre-war careers===
As the members of the class entered service, they initially operated in the Atlantic, and &quot;New Mexico&quot; escorted President Woodrow Wilson across the Atlantic to the Versailles Peace Conference that ended World War I. As the US Navy reorganized its fleet to emphasize a focus on affairs in Asia and the Pacific, the ships were reassigned to the Pacific Fleet in 1919, with &quot;New Mexico&quot; serving as the fleet flagship. Throughout this period, the fleet was based in San Pedro, California, but it frequently operated in Hawaiian waters, off the coast of Central and South America, and in the Caribbean Sea. In 1925, the Pacific Fleet embarked on a major cruise to visit Australia and New Zealand.

Beginning in 1923, the US Navy began a series of major exercises with Fleet Problem I, during which &quot;Mississippi&quot; sank the old battleship , which had by then been converted into a target ship; &quot;Mississippi&quot; used aircraft to spot her shots at long range, the first time this had been done in the US Navy. The fleet problems were typically held once a year, and they provided the basis for the US Navy&#x27;s operations in the Pacific War. Experience in the exercises that demonstrated that the standard type battleships were too slow to operate with aircraft carriers led to the development of the fast battleships built in the 1930s. Joint training with the Marine Corps provided experience that proved to be useful during the island-hopping campaign during the Pacific War. In 1937, the ships took part in training exercises in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to experiment with sub-arctic operations.

In mid-1940, the Battle Fleet was transferred from California to Hawaii in response to rising tensions between the United States and Japan over the latter&#x27;s aggression in the Second Sino-Japanese War. By 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Neutrality Patrols to protect American shipping caught in the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. All three &quot;New-Mexico&quot;-class ships were transferred from the Pacific to the Atlantic Fleet to reinforce the patrols in May that year. During this period, the ships escorted convoys between the United States and Iceland, though they saw no action with German U-boats that were waging an unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against merchant shipping in the North Atlantic.

===World War II===
Immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Navy reassigned the three battleships to the Pacific Fleet to shore up the fleet&#x27;s battleship strength. After arriving in California in January 1942, the ships spent the next several months patrolling the west coast of the United States and escorting convoys in the area. They took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign between May and July 1943, with &quot;Idaho&quot; serving as the flagship of the bombardment group that shelled the islands of Attu and Kiska. After maintenance and training at Pearl Harbor, the three &quot;New Mexico&quot;s then took part in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign that began in November, where they provided naval gunfire support to the Marines who stormed ashore at Tarawa, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok, among other islands in the archipelago. These operations continued into January 1944, at which point the fleet began preparations for the next major campaign, which would be directed against the Marianas Islands in the central Pacific.

&quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign beginning in June 1944, though &quot;Mississippi&quot; was out of service for a refit during the first part of the campaign. They shelled Japanese positions on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam as amphibious forces assaulted each island in turn. The two battleships remained with the invasion fleet to cover it from Japanese attacks while the Fast Carrier Task Force met and decisively defeated the Japanese 1st Air Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. By September, &quot;Mississippi&quot; had returned to the fleet to relieve &quot;New Mexico&quot; for her own refit, and she and &quot;Idaho&quot; shelled the island of Pelelieu, the last battle of the Marianas campaign. The fleet thereafter withdrew to Manus Island to prepare for the coming invasion of the Philippines, while &quot;New Mexico&quot; departed for a refit at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; supported the invasion of Leyte in October as part of the bombardment group under Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. The American invasion triggered the Japanese to launch Operation Shō-Gō 1, a major naval counterattack that resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 23–26 October, a complex battle that involved four separate actions. She was present at the Battle of Surigao Strait on the night of 24 October, which was one component of the battle. There, the Allied fleet destroyed the Japanese Southern Force consisting of a pair of old battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers; only one Japanese destroyer escaped the overwhelming Allied fleet. &quot;Mississippi&quot;, which still had her old Mark 3 radars, had difficulty in finding a target in the darkness and fired only one salvo in the last battleship action in history.
By January 1945, &quot;New Mexico&quot; had rejoined the fleet, the next target of which was the invasion of Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon; she and &quot;Mississippi&quot; supported the amphibious assault and during the battle both ships were struck by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; suicide plane. The two ships nevertheless remained in action until February when they departed for Pearl Harbor for repairs. By that time, &quot;Idaho&quot; had completed her refit and had rejoined the fleet in time to take part in the Battle of Iwo Jima. She shelled the island extensively before the Marines went ashore and continued to provide fire support during the battle. Repairs to &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; were completed quickly, and all three sister ships were reunited to support the invasion of Okinawa in May 1945. As Japan&#x27;s military situation continued to deteriorate, they launched increasingly desperate &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; were both hit by another &quot;kamikaze&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; was damaged by a near miss. &quot;New Mexico&quot; was also hit by a bomb, forcing her to withdraw for repairs. All three ships were repaired in time to participate in the initial occupation of Japan in August and September.

===Postwar===
&quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; returned to the east coast of the United States by October 1945, where they were both decommissioned. Initially slated to be kept in the reserve fleet, they were instead stricken from the naval register in 1947 and sold for scrap. &quot;Mississippi&quot; survived the postwar draw-down in naval strength through conversion into a gunnery training and evaluation ship to replace the older battleship . With the new hull number EAG-128 to designate her status as an auxiliary vessel, she was reconstructed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from November 1945 through April 1948 with a new armament that included a variety of different weapons, thereafter serving as the flagship of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force. She helped to evaluate anti-aircraft missiles in the mid-1950s before being decommissioned in February 1956 and sold to ship breakers. By that time, she had spent nearly 39 years in service.

<text>Allan Emrys Blakeney (September 7, 1925April 16, 2011) was a Canadian politician who served as the tenth premier of Saskatchewan from 1971 to 1982. Originally from Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Blakeney moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, and worked in the province&#x27;s civil service before running for office with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) under Tommy Douglas. Blakeney became leader of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1970. Altogether, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1960 to 1988.

Before he was premier, Blakeney played a key role in the implementation of the first Canadian public health insurance program (Medicare) in 1962. As premier, Blakeney&#x27;s government nationalized the potash industry, created a range of new crown corporations such PotashCorp and SaskOil, and fought with the federal government over resource rights and taxation. Blakeney&#x27;s NDP reformed labour legislation and introduced the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. Blakeney was also a key figure in the negotiations surrounding Patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s, and in the development of the Constitution&#x27;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. After retiring from politics, Blakeney taught and wrote about constitutional law for more than two decades.

==Early life and career==
Blakeney was born in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia on September 7, 1925. He attended Dalhousie University in Halifax and earned a degree in history and political science, followed by a law degree from Dalhousie Law School, winning a gold medal. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and attended Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, making an appearance at the 1948 Spengler Cup tournament. At Oxford, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree, second class, in politics, philosophy. and economics. Although he grew up in a conservative household—his father worked as an election scrutineer for the Conservatives in Nova Scotia—Blakeney&#x27;s time in law school, the events of the Second World War, and his experience in postwar England, where Clement Atlee&#x27;s Labour government was actively building the British welfare state, all inclined him towards government intervention in meeting the needs of citizens. His eventual embrace of the CCF is said to have caused a &quot;mild scandal in Bridgewater.&quot;

After graduating from Oxford, Blakeney returned to Canada and passed the Nova Scotia bar exam in 1950. That same year he married and took a job with the Saskatchewan civil service, prompting a move to Regina. Blakeney was attracted to the province due to the innovation of Tommy Douglas&#x27; CCF administration, which in 1944 had become the first social democratic government elected in North America. Blakeney later stated that he initially intended to stay in Saskatchewan for only a couple of years, explaining that &quot;Saskatchewan was the end of the Earth to me in 1950&quot;. However, he found the work engaging, and during the 1950s he became a senior civil servant. His first wife, Molly, with whom he had two children, died suddenly in 1957. He married his second wife, Anne, in 1959, and the couple would raise four children altogether.

== Early political career (1960–1971) ==

=== CCF/NDP MLA ===
By the end of the 1950s, Blakeney decided to enter politics himself. He first ran as a CCF candidate in the 1960 election at a time when electoral districts elected multiple members for the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Blakeney was one of four MLAs elected for Regina City—he would go on to represent a Regina-based riding without interruption until his retirement in 1988, including Regina Elphinstone from 1975 onward.

Blakeney served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Douglas and—when Douglas resigned to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party—Woodrow Lloyd, until the government was defeated in the 1964 election. In cabinet, he served as minister of education, provincial treasurer, and most prominently as minister of health. In that role, he helped implement Medicare in the province, including helping to resolve the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike.

In 1969, Blakeney was elected national president of the federal NDP, succeeding James Renwick. He held the position until 1971, when he was succeeded by Donald MacDonald.

=== NDP leadership ===
In 1964, the party was defeated by Ross Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals after five consecutive terms in government. The defeat, coming on the heels of the protracted Medicare battle, prompted a transition period for the party, now in Opposition. In 1967, the party fully adopted the NDP name. Around the same time, the party—both provincially and nationally—became gripped with a factional dispute with a growing left-wing movement called &quot;The Waffle&quot;. The Waffle advocated for a return to the party&#x27;s socialist roots, including through the nationalization of key industries. The movement had a strong base in Saskatchewan, the historic NDP stronghold. However, it was divisive. While its Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada was defeated in a vote at the 1969 federal NDP convention, Woodrow Lloyd voted in support of it, believing in the manifesto&#x27;s potential to revitalize debate in the party. That episode, and resistance to Lloyd&#x27;s willingness to open the party to debate, contributed to Lloyd&#x27;s decision to resign as leader in 1970. Blakeney decided to run in the race to succeed Lloyd.

Blakeney was joined in the race by young lawyer Roy Romanow, who had joined the caucus in 1967; Waffle candidate Don Mitchell; and labour candidate George Taylor. Blakeney&#x27;s motivation was principally to continue the legacy of the CCF in building and maintaining the welfare state. While Mitchell had a strong showing in the leadership election, Blakeney ultimately defeated Romanow on the final ballot. The result was seen as a victory for the party establishment over the Waffle. However, once he became leader, a priority for Blakeney was uniting the party and he would prove open to some of the movement&#x27;s proposals.

==Premier of Saskatchewan (1971–1982)==
Blakeney&#x27;s first election platform as leader was titled &quot;A New Deal for People&quot;, and it offered an ambitious social democratic agenda premised on state intervention in the economy and strong support for organized labour, and promising expanded health and social programs, including drug and children&#x27;s dental programs, housing development, and increased supports for the poor and elderly. In the 1971 provincial election, Blakeney defeated Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals and led the NDP to power with their highest ever share of the popular vote at 55%.

One of Blakeney&#x27;s key priorities was putting together a strong cabinet and building a robust civil service, which had been significantly weakened by Thatcher, who had prioritized a smaller government. Blakeney believed in evidence-based policy and relied heavily on the professional civil service and delegation to cabinet ministers. In terms of policy, the government quickly enacted extensive labour reforms, for example making it easier for workers to organize and guaranteeing the right to collectively bargain. The NPD also established legal aid and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission.

One of the NDP&#x27;s earliest and most controversial initiatives was the creation of a Land Bank for agricultural land. An attempt to address rural decline, driven in part through agricultural consolidation and the weakening of the family farm, the Bank could purchase available land and then lease it to young farmers, guaranteeing them tenure but also providing the option to purchase the land after a five-year term. Blakeney also introduced programs to stabilize crop prices, retain transportation links, and modernize rural life. Blakeney later stated that he looked back &quot;ruefully&quot; on the government&#x27;s uneven efforts to stem the tide of corporatization in agriculture, citing the extremely high costs—such as those borne by many European states—as a barrier to true success.

Blakeney&#x27;s government was resource nationalist, and he saw mineral resource development as a key to achieving the government&#x27;s goals. The advent of the Energy Crisis in the 1970s, which resulted in a rapid rise in energy commodity prices, made resource development a priority, and Blakeney relied on a state-led model of development. Above all, Blakeney believed that the primary beneficiaries of resource development in the province needed to be its citizens rather than the corporate sector. The NDP created new crown corporations such as SaskOil, a relatively small enterprise mainly concerned with exploration, and the Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation, which became a key developer of the province&#x27;s significant uranium reserves. The province also went to court with the federal government over resource taxation, and joined with Alberta in its opposition to the federal National Energy Program, which exacerbated a new wave of western alienation sentiment. The province&#x27;s most significant decision was to nationalize the potash industry in 1976. These developments were not without controversy. The potash industry was initially shocked by nationalization, but the province managed to arrange purchase agreements and never had to expropriate any mines. Uranium development, meanwhile, proved contentious within the NDP as environmental and peace activists favoured a moratorium on the resource. However, the Blakeney government also created a Department of the Environment, introduced environmental assessment standards, and held a number of public inquiries into resource projects.

Like CCF premiers Douglas and Lloyd, Blakeney placed an emphasis on sound fiscal management. The government&#x27;s significant spending on social programs was largely offset by its new ventures in resource development along with high royalties. Blakeney not only presented a succession of surplus budgets, but established a Heritage fund for the province, saving surplus resource revenues for future economic challenges. With this record, Blakeney&#x27;s NDP were comfortably re-elected in the 1975 and 1978 provincial elections.

=== Patriation negotiations ===
Given his legal background, Blakeney was intensely interested in constitutional matters, and he played an important role in the federal-provincial negotiations that led to the 1982 Patriation of the Canadian Constitution. One priority was ensuring the recognition of provincial rights over natural resources in the Constitution; to this end, Blakeney worked closely with Alberta premier Peter Lougheed to negotiate those rights, which were ultimately enshrined in Section 92A of the Constitution. Blakeney was also instrumental in the development of Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which enshrined the notwithstanding clause and thus preserved a preeminent role in legislation for elected governments over appointed courts. After an initial draft without it was agreed to, Blakeney and his team also ensured the ultimate inclusion of Section 35, which enshrined Indigenous rights in the Constitution. This was achieved when other negotiators insisted on changes to ensure that sexual equality rights could not be subject to the notwithstanding clause; Blakeney stated that he would agree to such a change only if Section 35 was re-inserted.

==Late political career (1982–1988)==
Blakeney sought a fourth consecutive term in the 1982 provincial election. However, his government was defeated by Grant Devine&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives. The scope of the defeat was surprising: the NDP lost 35 of its 44 seats, its 9 elected members marking the smallest presence for the party since the 1930s. The result has been attributed to a variety of factors. The national economy was struggling. Public fatigue with constitutional matters made the NDP vulnerable to charges that they had lost touch with issues on the ground in Saskatchewan. The party also lost significant union support—normally a bulwark for the NDP—ahead of the election due both to its support for federal wage and price controls and for conflicts with organized labour late in its term, including legislating hospital staff back to work in 1982. It has also been noted that the NDP saw a significant decrease in support among female voters, which could be attributable to its labour dispute with the female-dominated hospital workers, constitutional negotiations, or, as has been speculated, a lack of female representation in the NDP government. In addition, Devine and his PCs ran an aggressive campaign on the slogan, &quot;There&#x27;s so much more we can be&quot;, promising more private business opportunities along with tax and interest relief.

Despite the defeat, Blakeney decided to stay on as Opposition leader. Blakeney led the party into the 1986 provincial election, and particularly after a string of deficit budgets from the PCs, reversing the 1982 result appeared possible. In the election, the NDP narrowly edged the PCs in the popular vote. However, the PCs—who secured a $1 billion farming aid package from Brian Mulroney&#x27;s federal Progressive Conservative government on the eve of the election—managed to ride a dominant performance in rural Saskatchewan into a second term. Although the NDP more than doubled its seat-count to 25, it was a disappointing result for Blakeney. In 1987, he announced that he would be resigning as party leader and MLA when a new leader was chosen. In November of that year, Romanow was acclaimed as Blakeney&#x27;s successor. In March 1988, Dwain Lingenfelter held Blakeney&#x27;s former Regina Elphinstone seat for the NDP in a by-election.

== After politics ==
After retiring from politics, Blakeney took a two-year chair teaching constitutional law at Osgoode Hall at Toronto&#x27;s York University. He then accepted the inaugural Law Foundation Chair at the University of Saskatchewan School of Law in Saskatoon, and remained a visiting scholar there. Blakeney served as a consultant to the Romanow government in the 1990s, and served on a number of boards, including the board of Cameco, a uranium company formed by the merger of the former Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation and the former federal Eldorado crown corporation. Blakeney was a past president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

In the 1990s, Blakeney worked on an International Development Research Centre project advising the African National Congress in South Africa. The project mainly entailed discussions ahead of the 1994 national elections, and Blakeney helped to advise on the nuances of federal political systems. The same decade, Blakeney spent time in the former Soviet republics of Russia and Kyrgyzstan—Cameco operated one of he largest gold mines in the latter—advising legislators and government.

Blakeney co-authored &quot;Political Management in Canada&quot; with Sandford Borins, with whom he worked at Osgoode Hall. The book, released in 1992, offers Blakeney&#x27;s perspective and experience on governance and social democracy. Blakeney published his memoirs in 2008.

=== Death ===
Blakeney died on April 16, 2011, at his home in Saskatoon of complications from cancer. Federal NDP leader Jack Layton dedicated his 2011 federal election campaign to Blakeney after he died halfway through the campaign. Approximately 600 people attended his memorial, including federal NDP leaders Layton and Ed Broadbent, former provincial premiers Roy Romanow, Lorne Calvert, Peter Lougheed, Ed Schreyer, Bill Davis, and Bob Rae, as well as Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall.

=== Honours ===
On April 30, 1992, Blakeney was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada for his work as premier, his contribution to the field of public administration, and for his role as a key player in introducing the first comprehensive public medical health care plan in Canada. In 2000, he was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and in 2001, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He received honorary degrees from the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina, York University, Mount Allison University, and Western University.

In 2017, Regina&#x27;s adult campus, where adults aged 18 to 21 who did not complete high school can obtain secondary school credits, was renamed the Allan Blakeney Adult Campus in his honour. There is also a memorial plinth for Blakeney in Wascana Centre, near the Saskatchewan Legislative Building.

== Legacy ==
Blakeney was closely involved in Saskatchewan government and politics from the 1950s into the 1990s, actually sitting in government for nearly the entirety of the 1960s through the 1980s. As such, he played a significant role in the province&#x27;s political and social development, while his influence also extended beyond the province. Within Saskatchewan, Blakeney&#x27;s government has been seen as the last truly social democratic government in the CCF tradition, whose &quot;progressive creativity&quot; helped to shape the province&#x27;s political institutions. This legacy is clearly seen in the province&#x27;s continued tradition of supporting its crown corporations, which were a major focus of Blakeney&#x27;s government. Blakeney&#x27;s government has been called &quot;the most innovative in Canadian history.&quot;

Beyond Saskatchewan, Blakeney&#x27;s legacy has been widely acknowledged, especially in health care and constitutional matters. Although Blakeney was first elected as a CCF MLA in 1960 in what was effectively a referendum election on public health insurance in the province, he played a critical role in navigating the doctors&#x27; strike that nearly derailed the legislation and in implementing the program in its aftermath as the Minister of Health. Only a few years later, Canada implemented Medicare nationwide. Blakeney was also critical in negotiations leading to Patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. His legacy is noted especially in Sections 35 and 92a, as well as Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The notwithstanding clause remains controversial in Canada. For his part, Blakeney argued that it was an important check on appointed courts by democratically elected governments; while courts could rule on certain legal rights, they had less purview to rule on moral rights—such as the right to healthcare—that can only be enacted and enforced by governments. In essence, Blakeney asserted that certain rights should not be given precedence over others because they were included in the Charter. Overall, Blakeney saw the Charter as incomplete for protecting only individual and not collective rights.

<doc id="483825" wikidata="Q1111230" url="?curid=483825" title="Colorado-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Colorado&quot;-class battleships were a group of four United States Navy super-dreadnoughts, the last of its pre-Treaty battleships. Designed during World War I, their construction overlapped the end of that conflict and continued in its immediate aftermath. Though all four keels were laid, only three ships entered service: , , and . was over 75% completed when she was canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922. As such, the 16&quot; gun &quot;Colorado&quot;-class ships were the last and most powerful battleships built by the U.S. Navy until the entered service on the eve of World War II.

The &quot;Colorado&quot;s were the final group of the Standard-type battleships, designed to have similar speed and handling to simplify maneuvers with the line of battle. The cancelled which was to follow would have in several ways been a departure from this practice. Apart from an upgrade in striking power with their eight 16-inch guns, the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were essentially repeats of the earlier . The &quot;Colorado&quot;s were also the last American capital ships built with four main armament turrets and twin-mounted guns.

All three ships had extensive careers during World War II. &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;West Virginia&quot; were both present during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. While &quot;Maryland&quot; escaped relatively unscathed, &quot;West Virginia&quot; was sunk in the shallow waters of the harbor but subsequently raised and repaired. All three ships served as naval gunfire support ships during numerous amphibious operations. &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;West Virginia&quot; were present at the last surface action between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. All three ships were placed into the reserve fleet after the end of the war and were scrapped by the late 1950s.

==Design==
The construction of battleships armed with 16-inch guns was envisioned by the General Board of the United States Navy and Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) as early as 1913, as the upgrade in gun caliber promised twice the kinetic energy of the 12-inch gun then in service and half again as much as the 14-inch gun then being introduced. The 14-inch gun dominated the design of battleships between 1913 and 1916, just as the 12-inch gun had dictated designs from 1908 to 1910. However, while the General Board approved the 16-inch gun as early as 1911, George von Lengerke Meyer, the Secretary of the Navy, felt that a move to the larger gun caliber would make capital ships still on the drawing board obsolete. For this reason, he restricted the Bureau of Ordnance to proceed no further than blueprints for the new gun as a hedge against foreign developments. He finally approved construction of this gun in October 1912 and the weapon was test-fired successfully in August 1914. This success, along with the unofficial news in several naval publications of 15- and 16-inch weapons being adopted by the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Japan, led the Board to consider cancelling the construction of the in favor of an up-gunned design. Such a move meant an increase of 8,000 tons per ship, twice as much as the jump from the s to the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;s. Debate continued for the next three years. Each year, President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, balked at the potential increase in cost and ordered instead that the design features of the Standard Class be continued, but eventually compromised with the 1917 design battleships by allowing their armament to be upgraded. However, this was the only substantial change permitted.

The design of the &quot;Colorado&quot; class was therefore adapted from the preceding ; other than the significant improvement of eight /45 caliber guns in four dual turrets taking the place of the &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class&#x27;s twelve /50 caliber guns in four triple turrets, there was no major difference between the two designs. Likewise, the &quot;Tennessee&quot;s were the results of modifications to the , which had been the most modern U.S. Navy capital ships to see service in World War I and had attracted the attention of British constructors both serving with and outside C&amp;R. This similarity would carry over into the and es as the U.S. Navy further standardized its capital ship designs. This was partly the result of wartime experience, when over 250 destroyers and more than 450 submarine chasers had to be built quickly for service in the North Atlantic. The U.S. Navy had done this by a process almost akin to the assembly line, sticking to one basic design per class with a maximum amount of standardization and rationalization. Since the Naval Act of 1916 meant the imminent construction of 16 battleships and six battlecruisers, it was necessary to streamline production to save time and labor.

Nevertheless, while U.S. battleships were standardized as much as possible, design improvements were incorporated whenever practicable. Most of the changes in the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships&#x27; main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, proposals sent to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, alterations to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Colorado&quot;s were very similar overall to the &quot;Tennessee&quot;s, with a overall length and a beam at the waterline of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load and had a draft of . As in the &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; classes, they were designed with a clipper bow to help keep the ships dryer in heavy seas, and also kept the secondary armament in the superstructure rather than in the upper hull (&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and earlier classes), where the guns had proved to be excessively wet in heavy seas and thus were frequently unusable.

===Propulsion===
Turbo-electric transmission, which had been used in the prior class, was retained here. Advantages included the ability for the turbines to run at optimum speed without regard to propeller speed, which led to greater fuel economy and range, and an easier sub-division of machinery, which increased the ships&#x27; ability to withstand torpedo hits. Each of the four propeller shafts was powered by a 5,424 kilowatt electric motor, fed by two two-phase turbo generators (General Electric for &quot;Maryland&quot;, Westinghouse for &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;West Virginia&quot;) rated at 5,000 volts). Eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers, each in its individual compartment, provided steam for the generators. Altogether, the ships&#x27; power plant was rated at 28,900 electrical horsepower (EHP) to provide a flank speed of . With a maximum bunker capacity of 4570 tons, the &quot;Colorado&quot;s″ range without refueling at sea was .

===Armament===

====Main guns====
The &quot;Colorado&quot; class was armed with eight /45 caliber Mark 1 guns, which fired a armor-piercing (AP) shell at a muzzle velocity of and a rate of about 1.5 rounds per minute to a range of at a maximum turret elevation of 30 degrees. Development of this weapon had begun in August 1913, using a bored-out and relined Mark 2 gun, with the promise of twice the muzzle energy of the /50 caliber Mark 7 guns and 50 percent more than the 14-inch /45 caliber weapon used on the &quot;New York&quot;-class battleships. After an initial proof firing in July 1914 and minor changes, the 16-inch Mark 1 was re-proved in May 1916 and production approved in January 1917. When the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were modernized in the 1930s, these guns were rebuilt per standard navy practice and redesignated 16-inch/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 5 and Mark 8.

====Secondary guns====
Fourteen /51 caliber Mark 15 guns were installed to defend against enemy destroyers. This was reduced to 12 in 1922. The Mark 15 fired a shell at a velocity of to a maximum range of at 20 degrees at a rate of seven rounds per minute and was extremely accurate, with a danger space longer than the range to the target for distances less than . As in the &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; classes, these were mounted in unarmored casemates on the main deck, one deck higher than in previous classes, to allow them to be manned in heavy weather if necessary.

Heavily damaged at Pearl Harbor, in 1942 &quot;West Virginia&quot; began a major reconstruction that saw her Mark 15 guns removed and replaced with sixteen /38 caliber Mark 12 dual-purpose guns in twin turrets. Urgently needed in the Pacific, &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; retained 8 of the prewar Mark 15s, in Colorado&#x27;s case until the end of the war; the twin turrets planned and later installed were at that time in short supply, and it was only in May 1945 that &quot;Maryland&quot; would be refitted with 16 5in/38 in 8 twin mountings as in &quot;West Virginia&quot;. The Mark 12 fired a shell to a maximum range of and a maximum elevation of at an elevation of 45 degrees. They had a high rate of fire due to their being hand-loaded but power-rammed and their capability for easy loading at any angle of elevation. The introduction of proximity-fused anti-aircraft shells in 1943 made the 5 in/38 even more potent in this capacity.

====Anti-aircraft guns====

Four /23 caliber guns were mounted initially for anti-aircraft (AA) defense. This was increased to eight guns in 1922. These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of and ceiling of at an elevation of 45.3 degrees and a rate of between eight and nine rounds per minute. These weapons were replaced in 1928–1929 with the same number of /25 caliber guns, the first Navy gun designed specifically for AA use. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of between 15 and 20 rounds per minute to a maximum range of at an elevation of 45 degrees and a ceiling of at a maximum elevation of 85 degrees. These weapons were supplemented with quadruple-mount (quad) 1.1-inch/75-caliber guns in 1937–1938.

In 1942, the air defense system on these ships was overhauled completely. In addition to their 5 in/25s, they carried sixteen Bofors 40 mm guns in quad mounts and up to thirty-two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons in single mounts. The quad 40 mm Bofors fired a shell at a rate of 120 rounds per minute per barrel nominal, 140 to 160 rounds per minute when horizontal (gravity assist), to a maximum range of at 45 degrees and a ceiling of . The 20 mm Oerlikons fired a shell at an average muzzle velocity of and a practical rate of between 250 and 320 rounds per minute to a maximum range of at 45 degrees and a ceiling of .

A second overhaul of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy had found 20 mm shells too light to stop Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these manually-controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40 mm Bofors mounts were fitted. &quot;Maryland&quot; eventually carried 40 40 mm in 10 quad mountings and 36 20mm in 18 twin mountings (a different source has her with forty-four 40mm in 11 quad mounts and forty-four 20mm in 20 twin and 1 quad mountings.) &quot;Colorado&quot; had either 32 or 40 40mm in quad mountings but with 39 single, 8 twin and 1 quad 20mm. &quot;West Virginia&quot; carried forty 40 mm in quad mountings and 64 20 mm guns in 58 single, one twin and one quad mounting.

===Armor and underwater protection===
The &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor scheme introduced in the &quot;Nevada&quot;-class battleships was continued here, as throughout the Standard-type warships, with armor suite virtually identical to the preceding &quot;Tennessee&quot; class. The exception was an increase in belt armor near vital machinery to to correspond with the increased main gun caliber. Otherwise, the minimum thickness along the belt remained 14 inches. Upper deck armor was initially and was later increased to . Lower deck armor ranged between and was also presumably strengthened during conversion.

As with the &quot;Tennessee&quot;s, the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were modernized in the 1930s to improve their staying power. A new underwater protection scheme featured five compartments separated by armored bulkheads thick on either side of the ship: an outer empty one, three filled, and an empty inner one. In addition, the eight boilers were moved from their location in previous designs and placed in separate spaces to port and starboard of the turboelectric power plant. This arrangement formed another line of defense, which would allow the ship to sail if one or even an entire side of boilers was incapacitated. A consequence was the chief aesthetic change between the &quot;New Mexico&quot;s and &quot;Tennessee&quot;s: the single large of the former was replaced by two smaller funnels in the latter. Turret armor was 5&quot; on the roofs, 8 on the sides and rears, and 18 on the faces.

Other improvements imported from the &quot;Tennessee&quot; class included an attempt to move the forward torpedo room away from the 16-inch gun magazines, as the room was viewed as vulnerable. Also, the design called for the use of external, rather than internal, belt armor so that a &quot;break in the continuity of the side structure&quot; would not exist, which would minimize drag in the water and any corresponding waste of power.

==Modifications==

With fiscal year 1917 appropriations, bids on the four &quot;Colorado&quot;s were opened on 18 October 1916; though &quot;Maryland&quot;″s keel was laid on 24 April 1917, the other three battleships were not until 1919–1920. With the cancellation of the first , the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were the last U.S. battleships to enter service for nearly two decades. They were also the final U.S. battleships to use twin gun turrets—the s and second &quot;South Dakota&quot; classes had nine 16-inch/45 caliber guns and the s used nine 16 in/50 caliber in three triple turrets.

===Inter-war modernization===
Plans for modernization of the &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; classes were made in October 1931, in part to take advantage of loopholes in the Washington Naval Treaty. While reconstruction under this treaty was allowed only to increase protection from air and underwater attack, it could include improvements in fire control and increased elevation for main armament as these items were not listed in the treaty. Also, any changes made inside the hull could be justified as meant to increase protection, even if the outcome meant increased speed or longer operational range, since the term &quot;blister&quot; had been specified to limit changes only outside the hull, such as main armor belt thickness and main gun caliber. Modifications to the secondary battery were also outside the purview of the Washington Treaty.

Included in initial plans was some protection against chemical shells which contained poisonous gas, although the General Board stated in the late 1920s that decontaminating a battleship hit with these shells would not be possible—the ship would have to be scuttled. Also, the deck armor was to be bolstered with -special treatment steel (STS)—which would add to the displacement of the ships—the armor on the tops of the main turrets was to be made thicker, fire controls were to be improved with the latest technology, and new shells for the main guns were to be designed. Two (later four) quad 1.1-inch guns were to be added, and all of the machinery in place would be removed in favor of newer equipment so that the ships would not lose any speed with the great increase in weight. Anti-torpedo bulges were also to be installed to improve buoyancy but not to increase the ships&#x27; beams any greater than so they could still use the Panama Canal when transferring from the Atlantic to the Pacific and vice verse. These improvements were estimated to cost about $15,000,000 per ship ($71,723,000 total). However, with the country in the throes of the Great Depression, not much money was available for the Navy. Savings of $26,625,000 could be realized by reconditioning the propulsion machinery rather than replacing it, which would lower the ships&#x27; speed. Adding protection against chemical shells could be dropped, along with development of the new shells. Nevertheless, the cost-saving elements of the later proposal were later dropped. The Navy asked the Secretary of the Navy to request money in the fiscal year 1933 to modernize the two classes from Congress, but the depression worsened. Although proposals for modifications were still made, plans were put on hold and never carried out.

In the beginning of 1934, the Bureau of Construction and Repair proposed that the &quot;Big Five&quot;—the two &quot;Tennessee&quot;s and three &quot;Colorado&quot;s—be fitted with anti-torpedo bulges so that the ships could benefit from increased buoyancy; because of, among other factors, the normal procedure of leaving port with the maximum amount of fuel possible on board, the five ships were quite overweight and rode low in the water. For example, in June 1935, &quot;Tennessee&quot; had a normal operating displacement of —more than above the maximum emergency load her original design called for. This made her draft higher—meaning that the ship&#x27;s waterline was down . Construction and Repair called for a bulge on the &quot;Colorado&quot;s that would displace about and raise the ships&#x27; draft by . Installing these would be a year&#x27;s worth of work, with each ship spending six months of that in a dry dock—the first month docked so that the hull shape could be determined, the next six sailing while the bulge was built, and the last five back in the dock so it could be added to the ship.

Three years later (1937), the various Navy bureaus held a joint meeting to discuss a possible partial modernization of the &quot;Tennessee&quot;s and &quot;Colorado&quot;s. They were much different than the changes proposed in 1933; there were no provisions for extra deck armor, but many additions and replacements. To gain space for newer fire control systems, the ships were to be reboilered. The main and secondary battery fire controls were to be replaced, including new rangefinders and plotting room instruments for the main, while new Mark 33 anti-aircraft fire control directors were planned. The mainmast and M2 Brownings would be removed, and studies of the feasibility of a torpedo bulge, the addition of which Construction and Repair believed to be paramount, which would increase the beam to and displacement to . Varying plans for these were complete by October 1938. None was a full reconstruction; costs ranged from $8,094,000 to $38,369,000 per ship. However, as the money for the improvements would lessen the amount available for new battleship construction, and these would be better than any reconstructed old battleship, the Secretary of the Navy rejected these plans in November. Congress did appropriate $6,600,000 in 1939 for some of these improvements, including the bulges.

===World War II changes===
With the beginning of World War II in Europe, the Navy began to apply lessons learned by the British to U.S. ships. The Board under Ernest J. King of 1940–1941 proposed sweeping changes to the secondary armament of the battleships to increase their defense against air attacks. These included the removal of all 5 in/25 caliber guns and 5 in/51 in favor of the dual-purpose 5 in/38, the addition of six quad 1.1-inch guns, and the cutting away of superstructure to clear arcs of fire for the new anti-aircraft weapons. An ultimate secondary battery of sixteen 5 in/38 in dual mounts, sixteen Bofors 40 mm in quadruple mounts and eight single Oerlikon 20 mm guns was called for by the board in 1941, although they were not certain the ships could handle the added weight and it would take a large amount of time in dry dock for these modifications to take place. With these concerns, an interim measure of four quad 1.1-inch guns was proposed by the board; however, the gun was not being produced in any great number very quickly, so a second interim solution was implemented. /50 caliber guns were added to all of the U.S. battleships except for &quot;Arizona&quot; and &quot;Nevada&quot; by June 1941; these were replaced on the three battleships in the Atlantic by the quad 1.1-inch guns by November—they received them first because they were closer to a war zone.

As these modifications were carried out upon the various battleships, much additional weight was added onto the already overweight ships, forcing torpedo bulges to be added so that a decent freeboard could be maintained. These would cost $750,000 and around three or four months in a dry dock. The King Board suggested that the deck armor be bolstered and 5 in/38 dual-purpose guns be added, but the Chief of Naval Operations decreed that any major changes such as these had to wait due to the wars raging around the world at the time. The addition of bulges, however, was approved for the &quot;Big Five&quot;, with each ship spending three months in dry dock at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. &quot;Maryland&quot; would be first (17 February 1941 to 20 May), followed by &quot;West Virginia&quot; (10 May to 8 August), &quot;Colorado&quot; (28 July to 28 October), &quot;Tennessee&quot; (19 January 1942 to 21 April) and &quot;California&quot; (16 March to 16 June). However, the estimates for how long the addition of bulges would take were too low; Puget Sound believed that they could complete work on &quot;Maryland&quot; in 123 calendar days (about four months)—if the work would be given a priority equal to that of ″s refit and higher than new construction.

Only two of the ships had bulges added to them through this program, &quot;Maryland&quot; (completed 1 August 1941) and &quot;Colorado&quot; (26 February 1942); the attack on Pearl Harbor interrupted the refits intended for &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the two &quot;Tennessee&quot;s. The surprise strike did not touch &quot;Colorado&quot;, which was at Puget Sound, and did not hurt &quot;Maryland&quot; very badly; however, &quot;West Virginia&quot; was severely damaged and needed a major refit at minimum.

Little to no major modifications were made to the two active &quot;Colorado&quot;s in the opening months of the U.S.&#x27;s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. &quot;Colorado&quot; was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, fourteen Oerlikon 20 mm and four quad 1.1-in guns; &quot;Maryland&quot; received a similar treatment later, the only difference being sixteen 20 mm guns and no 1.1-in guns. Although tower masts were constructed for &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; and a majority of their aft cage masts were cut down by the ships&#x27; crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared the time needed to install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.

&quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; were greatly needed in the war zone, and as such did not undergo a major refit until 1944, although minor additions and removals, mainly to the anti-aircraft weaponry, were made in-between. Throughout the war, both ships saw their anti-aircraft battery changed constantly. Beginning in 1942, they carried eight 5 in/25, four quad 1.1-in guns, a greatly varying number of 20 mm guns, and eight .50 caliber machine guns. In June 1942, &quot;Colorado&quot; had fourteen 20 mm guns; just five months later, this was upped to twenty-two, with thirty-six temporarily approved for a later time. By February 1943, both &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; had two more quad 1.1-in guns added (for a total of six mounts) and forty-eight total 20 mm guns; a month later she was given an additional ten .50 caliber machine guns. November 1943 saw the removal of two of the single-purpose 5 in/51, the six quad 1.1-in guns, and a small number of 20 mm guns (six on &quot;Colorado&quot; and eight on &quot;Maryland&quot;) in favor of thirty-two Bofors 40 mm guns – six quad and two twin.

Both ships finally underwent major refits in 1944. Here their remaining aft cage masts were taken off in favor of the tower masts, the two twin 40 mm replaced by quads, a quadruple 20 mm added, and a new radar fitted. Although more extensive refits were proposed by Admiral Ernest J. King, including the addition of eight twin 5 in/38, more advanced fire control systems, and a second protective deck plating, the Bureau of Ships, after demonstrating what would have to be removed as compensation for the weight added for King&#x27;s ideas, counter-proposed that a smaller reconstruction, like the ones given to the &quot;New Mexico&quot; class, would be more desirable. However, no action was taken until &quot;Maryland&quot; was struck by a kamikaze aircraft. While undergoing repair, eight twin 5 in/38 were added, but nothing else; her conning tower was removed and replaced by a special-treated steel structure to balance the additional weight of the 5 in guns.

==Ships in class==
===USS &quot;Colorado&quot;===

 was the third ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 38th state. Her keel was laid down on 29 May 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 22 March 1921 and commissioned on 30 August 1923, Captain R. R. Belknap in command. During her career, &quot;Colorado&quot; was involved in various ceremonies and fleet exercises, and assisted residents of Long Beach, California following the 1933 earthquake. In 1937, she was one of several ships that searched for Amelia Earhart after she and her plane went missing. &quot;Colorado&quot; was at Puget Sound undergoing overhaul at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

After extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast, &quot;Colorado&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in April 1942. From November 1942 to September 1943 she was stationed in the South West Pacific. In November 1943, she participated in operations against the Japanese during both the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign and Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, and shelled Luzon and Okinawa in advance of the planned amphibious assaults there. Following the end of World War II &quot;Colorado&quot; participated in Operation Magic Carpet before being decommissioned in 1947. She was sold for scrap in 1957.
===USS &quot;Maryland&quot;===

 was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the seventh state. Her keel was laid down on 24 April 1917 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 20 March 1920 and commissioned on 21 July 1921, Captain C.F. Preston in command. During her career she made a goodwill voyage to Australia and New Zealand in 1925, and transported President-elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of Latin America in 1928. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, she served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through multiple training exercises.

In 1940, &quot;Maryland&quot; changed her base of operations to Pearl Harbor. She was moored at Battleship Row next to Ford Island during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Damaged during the attack, &quot;Maryland&quot; reported to Puget Sound, where she was repaired and modernized. &quot;Maryland&quot; supported the amphibious landings during the Battle of Tarawa, and thereafter participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle of Peleliu, the Philippines campaign, and the Battle of Okinawa. Following the end of World War II &quot;Maryland&quot; participated in Operation Magic Carpet before being decommissioned in 1947. She was sold for scrap in 1959.
===USS &quot;Washington&quot;===

 was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 42nd state. Her keel was laid down on 30 June 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 1 September 1921, but on 8 February 1922, two days after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, all construction work ceased on the 75.9% completed dreadnought.

The ship was towed out to sea off the Virginia Capes in November 1924 to be used as a gunnery target. On the first day of testing, the ship was hit by two torpedoes and three near-miss bombs with minor damage and a list of three degrees. On that day, the ship had 400 pounds of TNT detonated on board, but she remained afloat. Two days later, the ship was hit by fourteen shells dropped from , but only one penetrated. The ship was finally sunk on 26 November 1924 by the battleships and with fourteen 14-inch shell hits. After the test, it was determined that the existing deck armor on battleships was inadequate, and that future battleships should be fitted with triple bottoms.
===USS &quot;West Virginia&quot;===

 was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 35th state. Her keel was laid down on 12 April 1920 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 17 November 1921 and commissioned on 1 December 1923, Captain Thomas J. Senn in command. Despite a grounding incident early in her career &quot;West Virginia&quot; received high acclaim for gunnery and armor protection, and was involved in exercises to test the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands in the 1930s. On the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;West Virginia&quot; was sunk at her berth in Battleship Row by multiple Japanese torpedo and bomb hits, but thanks in large part to counterflooding the battleship settled on an even keel, similar to . Refloated on 17 May 1942, &quot;West Virginia&quot; received sufficient temporary repairs to sail to Puget Sound for reconstruction and modernization.

In July 1944 she departed Puget Sound and rejoined the Pacific Fleet for combat operations on the eve of the Philippines campaign. There she participated in the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battleship vs battleship duel of World War II, where her new Mk. 8 fire-control radar enabled her to hit the with her first salvo – in the dark – at . In February 1945 &quot;West Virginia&quot; participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima, initially by preinvasion bombardment, and later by callfire support for the ground forces on the island. Her last combat operations were during the Battle of Okinawa; after the surrender of Japan, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. Decommissioned in 1947, she was sold for scrap in 1959.

<text>Les Rougon-Macquart () is the collective title given to a cycle of twenty novels by French writer Émile Zola. Subtitled Histoire naturelle et sociale d&#x27;une famille sous le Second Empire (&quot;Natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire&quot;), it follows the lives of the members of the two titular branches of a fictional family living during the Second French Empire (1852–1870) and is one of the most prominent works of the French naturalism literary movement.

==Influences==

Early in his life, Zola discovered the work of Honoré de Balzac and his famous cycle &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;. This had a profound impact on Zola, who decided to write his own, unique cycle. However, in 1869, he explained in &quot;Différences entre Balzac et moi&quot;, why he would not make the same kind of book as Balzac:

In one word, his work wants to be the mirror of the contemporary society. My work, mine, will be something else entirely. The scope will be narrower. I don&#x27;t want to describe the contemporary society, but a single family, showing how the race is modified by the environment. (...) My big task is to be strictly naturalist, strictly physiologist.

As a naturalist writer, Zola was highly interested by science and especially the problem of heredity and evolution. He notably read and mentioned the work of the doctor Prosper Lucas, Claude Bernard, and Charles Darwin as references for his own work. This led him to think that people are heavily influenced by heredity and their environment. He intended to prove this by showing how these two factors could influence the members of a family. In 1871, in the preface of , he explained his intent:

The great characteristic of the Rougon-Macquarts, the group or family which I propose to study, is their ravenous appetite, the great outburst of our age which rushes upon enjoyment. Physiologically the Rougon-Macquarts represent the slow succession of accidents pertaining to the nerves or the blood, which befall a race after the first organic lesion, and, according to environment, determine in each individual member of the race those feelings, desires and passions—briefly, all the natural and instinctive manifestations peculiar to humanity—whose outcome assumes the conventional name of virtue or vice.

==Preparations==

In a letter to his publisher, Zola stated his goals for the Rougon-Macquart: &quot;1° To study in a family the questions of blood and environments. [...] 2° To study the whole Second Empire, from the coup d&#x27;état to nowadays.&quot;

===Genealogy and heredity===
Since his first goal was to show how heredity can affect the lives of descendants, Zola started working on the Rougon-Macquart by drawing the family tree for the Rougon-Macquart. Though it was to be modified many times over the years, with some members appearing or disappearing, the original tree shows how Zola planned the whole cycle before writing the first book.

The tree provides the name and date of birth of each member, along with certain properties of his heredity and his life:

* The prepotency : The prepotency is a term used by the doctor Lucas. It is part of a biological theory that tries to determine how heredity transmits traits through generations. Zola apply this theory to the mental state of his protagonists and uses terms from the work of the doctor Lucas: &quot;Election du père&quot; (Prepotency of the father, meaning the father is the main influence on the child), &quot;Election de la mère&quot; (Prepotency of the mother), &quot;Mélange soudure&quot; (Fusion of the 2 parents) or &quot;Innéité&quot; (No influence from either parent).
* Physical likeness: Whether the member looks like his mother or his father.
* Biographical information: his job and important facts of his life. Additionally, for members still living at the end of &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;, their place of living at the end of the cycle may be included. Otherwise, the date of death is included.

&quot;Note: the gallery does not include the tree made for &quot;La Bete Humaine&quot; which included for the first time Jacques, the main protagonist of the book&quot;
For example, the entry for Jean Macquart on the 1878 tree read: &quot;Jean Macquart, né en 1831 - Election de la mère - Ressemblance physique du père. Soldat&quot; (Jean Macquart, born in 1831 - Prepotency of the mother - Physical likeness to his father. Soldier)

===The study of the Second Empire===

To study the Second Empire, Zola thought of each novel as a novel about a specific aspect of the life in his time. For example, in the list he made in 1872, he intended to make a &quot;political novel&quot;, a &quot;novel about the defeat&quot;, &quot;a scientific novel&quot;, and a &quot;novel about the war in Italy&quot;. The first three ideas led to &quot;Son Excellence Eugène Rougon&quot;, &quot;La Débâcle&quot;, and &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;, respectively. However, the last idea would never be made into a book.

Indeed, at the beginning, Zola did not know exactly how many books he would write. In the first letter to his publisher, he mentioned &quot;ten episodes&quot;. In 1872, his list included seventeen novels, but some of them would never be made (such as the one on the war in Italy), whereas others were to be added later on. In 1877, in the preface of &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;, he stated that he was going to write &quot;about twenty novels&quot;. In the end, he settled for twenty books.

==Story==
Almost all of the main protagonists for each novel are introduced in the first book, . The last novel in the cycle, &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;, contains a lengthy chapter that ties up loose ends from the other novels. In between, there is no &quot;best sequence&quot; in which to read the novels in the cycle, as they are not in chronological order and indeed are impossible to arrange into such an order. Although some of the novels in the cycle are direct sequels to one another, many of them follow on directly from the last chapters of , and there is a great deal of chronological overlap between the books; there are numerous recurring characters and several of them make &quot;guest&quot; appearances in novels centered on other members of the family.

===The Rougon-Macquart===
The Rougon-Macquart family begins with Adelaïde Fouque. Born in 1768 in the fictional Provençal town Plassans to middle-class parents (members of the French &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;), she has a slight intellectual disability. She marries Rougon, and gives birth to a son, Pierre Rougon. However, she also has a lover, the smuggler Macquart, with whom she has two children: Ursule and Antoine Macquart. This means that the family is split in three branches:

* The first, legitimate, one is the Rougons branch. They are the most successful of the children. Most of them live in the upper classes (such as Eugene Rougon who becomes a minister) or/and have a good education (such as Pascal, the doctor who is the main protagonist of &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;).
* The second branch is the low-born Macquarts. They are urban working-class (&quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;), farmers (&quot;La Terre&quot;), or soldiers (&quot;La Débâcle&quot;).
* The third branch is the Mourets (the name of Ursule Macquart&#x27;s husband). They are a mix of the other two. They are middle-class people (&quot;bourgeois&quot;) and tend to live more balanced lives than the others.

Because Zola believed that everyone is driven by their heredity, Adelaide&#x27;s children show signs of their mother&#x27;s original deficiency. For the Rougon, this manifests as a drive for power, money, and excess in life. For the Macquarts, who live in a difficult environment, it is manifested by alcoholism (&quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;), prostitution (&quot;Nana&quot;), and homicide (&quot;La Bête humaine&quot;). Even the Mourets are marked to a certain degree; in &quot;La Faute de l&#x27;Abbé Mouret&quot;, the priest Serge Mouret has to fight his desire for a young woman.


















===View of France under Napoleon III===
As a naturalist, Zola also gave detailed descriptions of urban and rural settings, and different types of businesses. &quot;Le Ventre de Paris&quot;, for example, has a detailed description of the central market in Paris at the time.

As a political reflection of life under Napoleon III, the novel &quot;La Conquête de Plassans&quot; looks at how an ambitious priest infiltrates a small Provence town one family at a time, starting with the Rougons. &quot;La Débâcle&quot; takes place during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and depicts Napoleon III&#x27;s downfall. &quot;Son Excellence&quot; also looks at political life, and &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot; and &quot;Au Bonheur des Dames&quot; look at middle class life in Paris.

Note that Zola wrote the novels after the fall of Napoleon III.

==List of novels==
In an &quot;Introduction&quot; of his last novel, &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;, Zola gave a recommended reading order, although it is not required, as each novel stands on its own.

==English translations==
All of the twenty novels have been translated into English under various titles and editions. For many years, the novels were best known in bowdlerized editions of the late 19th and early 20th century, especially those published by Vizetelly &amp; Co. Although the more well-known novels in the series received 20th century translations, and Elek Books published 11 new translations during the 1950s, many of the volumes remained largely out-of-print in the English language for decades after Zola&#x27;s death. For instance, &quot;The Fortune of the Rougons&quot; was translated in 1898, and then not again until 2012. &quot;The Kill&quot; was translated in 1895, and then not again until 2004.

After about 1970, modern translations of the more famous novels in the series, such as &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; and &quot;Germinal&quot;, were released by publishers like Penguin and Modern Library. Between 1993 (&quot;The Masterpiece&quot;) and 2021 (&quot;The Assommoir&quot;), Oxford World&#x27;s Classics published a complete run of all 20 novels in modern translation.

<text>The &quot;Alaska&quot;-class were six large cruisers ordered before World War II for the United States Navy (USN), of which only two were completed and saw service late in the war. The USN designation for the ships of this class was &#x27;large cruiser&#x27; (CB), a designation unique to the &quot;Alaska&quot;-class, and the majority of leading reference works consider them as such. However, various other works have alternately described these ships as battlecruisers despite the USN having never classified them as such, and having actively discouraged the use of the term in describing the class. The &quot;Alaskas&quot; were all named after territories or insular areas of the United States, signifying their intermediate status between larger battleships (which were mostly named after states) and smaller heavy and light cruisers (which were named after cities).

The idea for a large cruiser class originated in the early 1930s when the USN sought to counter the &quot;pocket battleships&quot; being launched by Germany. Planning for ships that eventually evolved into the &quot;Alaska&quot;-class began in the late 1930s after the deployment of Germany&#x27;s s and rumors that Japan was constructing a new large cruiser class, the B-65 &quot;super cruiser.&quot; To serve as &quot;cruiser-killers&quot; capable of seeking out and destroying these post-treaty heavy cruisers, the class was given large guns of a new and expensive design, limited armor protection against 12-inch shells, and machinery capable of speeds of about .

Of the six planned, and were the only two to be commissioned; a third, &quot;Hawaii&quot;, was close to completion at the war&#x27;s end and had its construction suspended on 16 April 1947, while the remaining three were cancelled. &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Guam&quot; served with the USN for the last year of World War II as bombardment ships and fast carrier escorts. They were decommissioned in 1947 after spending only 32 and 29 months in service, respectively.

== Background ==
Heavy cruiser development formalized between World War I and World War II due to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and successor treaties and conferences, where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit heavy cruisers to 10,000 tons displacement with 8-inch main armament. Up until the &quot;Alaska&quot; class, US cruisers designed between the wars followed this pattern.

The initial impetus for the &quot;Alaska&quot; design came from the deployments of Germany&#x27;s so-called pocket battleships in the early 1930s. Though no actions were immediately taken, these thoughts were revived in the late 1930s when intelligence reports indicated Japan was planning or building &quot;super cruisers&quot; of the B-65 class that would be much more powerful than the current US heavy cruisers. The navy responded in 1938 when the General Board asked the Bureau of Construction and Repair to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study of all types of naval vessels for consideration for a new and expanded building program&quot;. The US president at the time, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, may have taken a lead role in the development of the class with his desire to have a counter to raiding abilities of Japanese cruisers and German pocket battleships. While these claims are difficult to verify, others have speculated that their design was &quot;politically motivated&quot; rather than strategic.

=== Design ===
One historian described the design process of the &quot;Alaska&quot; class as &quot;torturous&quot; due to the numerous changes and modifications made to the ship&#x27;s layouts by numerous departments and individuals. Indeed, there were at least nine different layouts, ranging from 6,000-ton anti-aircraft cruisers to &quot;overgrown&quot; heavy cruisers and a 38,000-ton mini-battleship that would have been armed with twelve 12-inch and sixteen 5-inch guns. The General Board, in an attempt to keep the displacement under 25,000 tons, allowed the designs to offer only limited underwater protection such that they were vulnerable, by comparison with a battleship, to torpedoes and to shells that fell short of the ship. The final design was a scaled-up that had the same machinery as the s. This ship combined a main armament of nine 12-inch guns with protection against 10-inch gunfire into a hull that was capable of .

The &quot;Alaska&quot;s were officially funded in September 1940 along with a plethora of other ships as a part of the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in addition to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. This carrier escort capability was favored by Admiral King. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more powerful than the American heavy cruisers. The escort concept would also free the few existing heavy cruisers for scouting (their original purpose).

=== Possible conversion to aircraft carriers ===
Yet another drastic change was considered during the &quot;carrier panic&quot; in late 1941, when the US Navy realized that they needed more aircraft carriers as quickly as possible. Many hulls currently under construction were considered for conversion into carriers. At different times, they considered some or all of the light cruisers, the heavy cruisers, the &quot;Alaska&quot; class, and even one of the s; in the end, they chose the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s, resulting in the conversion of nine ships under construction at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard as the light aircraft carriers comprising the .

A conversion of the &quot;Alaska&quot; cruisers to carriers was &quot;particularly attractive&quot; because of the many similarities between the design of the s and the &quot;Alaska&quot; class, including the same machinery. However, when &quot;Alaska&quot; cruisers were compared to the &quot;Essex&quot; carriers, converted cruisers would have had a shorter flight deck (so they could carry only 90% of the aircraft), would have been lower in the water, and could travel less at . In addition, the large cruiser design did not include the extensive underwater protections found in normal carriers due to the armor weight devoted to counter shell fire. Lastly, an &quot;Alaska&quot; conversion could not satisfy the navy&#x27;s goal of having new aircraft carriers quickly, as the work needed to modify the ships into carriers would entail long delays. With this in mind, all planning to convert the &quot;Alaska&quot;s was abandoned on 7 January 1942.

== Construction ==

Of the six &quot;Alaska&quot;-class cruisers that were planned, only three were laid down. The first two, and , were completed by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. Construction of , the third, was suspended on 16 April 1947 when she was 84% complete. The last three, &quot;Philippines&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, and &quot;Samoa&quot;, were delayed since all available materials and slipways were allocated to higher priority ships, such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. Construction had still not begun when steel shortages and a realization that these &quot;cruiser-killers&quot; had no more cruisers to hunt—as the fleets of Japanese cruisers had already been defeated by aircraft and submarines—made the ships &quot;white elephants&quot;. As a result, construction of the last three members of the class never began, and they were officially cancelled on 24 June 1943.

== Service history ==
 and served with the U.S. Navy during the last year of World War II, forming Cruiser Division 16 commanded by Rear Admiral Francis S. Low, USN. Similar to the fast battleships, their firepower was useful in shore bombardment, and their speed made them excellent fast carrier escorts, a role for which the two had become celebrated within the fleet by the war&#x27;s end. Both &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Guam&quot; protected when she was on her way to be repaired in Guam after being hit by two Japanese bombs. Afterward, &quot;Alaska&quot; supported the landings on Okinawa, while &quot;Guam&quot; went to San Pedro Bay to become the leader of a new task force, Cruiser Task Force 95, under the overall command of Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. &quot;Guam&quot;, joined by &quot;Alaska&quot;, four light cruisers, and nine destroyers, led the task force into the East China and Yellow Seas to conduct raids upon shipping; however, they encountered only Chinese junks.

After the war, both ships served as part of Task Force 71, the designation for the U.S. Seventh Fleet&#x27;s North China Naval Force. Its mission was to support the American occupation of southern Korea. This included executing various show-the-flag operations along the western coast of Korea as well as in the Bohai Sea. These naval demonstrations preceded Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing of U.S. Army ground forces at Incheon, Korea, on 10 September 1950. Subsequently, both ships returned to the United States in mid-December 1945, and they were decommissioned and &quot;mothballed&quot; in 1947, after having spent 32 months (&quot;Alaska&quot;) and 29 months (&quot;Guam&quot;) in service.

In 1958, the Bureau of Ships prepared two feasibility studies to explore whether &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Guam&quot; could be suitably converted into guided-missile cruisers. The first study involved removing all of the guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160 million, the cost of this proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study&#x27;s plan ($82 million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. &quot;Alaska&quot; was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and &quot;Guam&quot; on 24 May 1961.
The still-incomplete was considered for a conversion to be the Navy&#x27;s first guided-missile cruiser; this thought lasted until 26 February 1952, when a different conversion to a &quot;large command ship&quot; was contemplated. In anticipation of the conversion, her classification was changed to CBC-1. This would have made her a &quot;larger sister&quot; to , but a year and a half later (9 October 1954) she was re-designated CB-3. &quot;Hawaii&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959.

== &quot;Large cruisers&quot; or &quot;battlecruisers&quot; ==
The &quot;Alaska&quot; class, along with the Dutch Design 1047 battlecruiser and the Japanese Design B-65 cruiser, were specifically to counter the heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals. All three have been described as &quot;super cruisers&quot;, &quot;large cruisers&quot; or even &quot;unrestricted cruisers&quot;, with some (up to Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships of World War II itself) advocating that they even be considered as battlecruisers. However, they were &quot;never&quot; officially classified as capital ships, as that designation was reserved for true battlecruisers and battleships. Early in its development, the class used the US battlecruiser designation CC, which had been planned for the . However, the designation was changed to CB to reflect their new status, &quot;large cruiser&quot;, and the practice of referring to them as battlecruisers was officially discouraged. The U.S. Navy then named the individual vessels after U.S. territories, rather than states (as was the tradition with battleships) or cities (for which cruisers were traditionally named), to symbolize the belief that these ships were supposed to play an intermediate role between heavy cruisers and fully-fledged battleships.

The &quot;Alaska&quot; class certainly resembled contemporary US battleships (particularly the , , and ) in appearance, including the familiar 2-A-1 main battery and massive columnar mast. Their displacement was twice that of the newest heavy cruisers (the ), being only 5,000 tons less than the Washington Treaty&#x27;s battleship standard displacement limit of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t) (unchanged through the final naval treaty, the London Treaty of 1936). They were also longer than several treaty battleships such as the and &quot;North Carolina&quot; class.

In overall terms, the design of the &quot;Alaska&quot; class was scaled up from that of the (themselves the first cruisers in the US Navy to be designed without the limitations of the London Naval Treaty, and exceeding 10,000 tons standard displacement). The armor scheme of the &quot;Alaska&quot;s was deemed sufficient to provide protection against not only 8″ heavy cruiser shells but even the larger 11″ shells used by Germany&#x27;s &quot;pocket battleships&quot; and -class battleships. However, they lacked the comprehensive underwater protection systems found on the larger US battleships or even on smaller, earlier battleships like the French and German &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; classes. Thus, the &quot;Alaska&quot;s were potentially as vulnerable to torpedoes as a heavy cruiser was, as well as to effects from near-misses and &#x27;shorts&#x27; (where enemy gunnery misses the ship proper, instead impacting the sea; this could still damage the target ship, as the shell may have enough energy to impact beneath the waterline, or if a shell detonated underwater, the shockwave could damage the target ship).

In addition, despite being much larger than the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class, the secondary battery of the &quot;Alaska&quot;s was identical, albeit with an improvement in light anti-aircraft battery size. Whereas the &quot;Alaska&quot; class carried twelve 5&quot;/38 caliber in six twin turrets, fifty-six 40 mm, and thirty-four 20 mm guns, the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class carried the same number of 5&quot;/38s, eight fewer 40 mm, and ten fewer 20 mm, considerably fewer than new U.S. battleships that had ten (save for ) 5&quot;/38 twin mounts while older refitted U.S. battleships had eight. The lack of anti-aircraft weaponry for a ship of its size was attributed to the amidships aircraft catapult like older US cruisers; while other modern U.S. cruisers and battleships opted for stern-mounted aircraft catapults to free up space along the central superstructure for more secondaries and anti-aircraft guns. In common with U.S. heavy cruisers, they had aircraft hangars and a single large rudder; the single rudder combined with the hull&#x27;s long length gave the &quot;Alaska&quot;s a turning radius of , which exceeded the turning circles of larger battleships and carriers in the U.S. Navy. Author Richard Worth remarked that when they were finally completed, launched, and commissioned, they had the &quot;size of a battleship but the capabilities of a cruiser&quot;. The &quot;Alaska&quot; class was similarly expensive to build and maintain as contemporary battleships, yet far less capable due to armor deficiencies, while able to put up an anti-aircraft defense comparable only to the much cheaper &quot;Baltimore&quot; cruisers.

Despite these cruiser-like characteristics, and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s insistence on their status as cruisers, the &quot;Alaska&quot; class has been frequently described as battlecruisers. The official navy magazine &quot;All Hands&quot; said &quot;The &quot;Guam&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Alaska&quot; are the first American battle cruisers ever to be completed as such.&quot; Author Chris Knupp noted that while &quot;other nations fulfilled the battlecruiser role by designing vessels like battleships, but stripped of armor and other features to gain speed&quot;, the United States &quot;fulfilled the battlecruiser role by creating a larger, more powerful heavy cruiser...[whose] design already offered less armor and higher speed, but by enlarging the ship they gained the heavier firepower&quot;. Armament-wise, the &quot;Alaska&quot;s″ had much larger guns than contemporary heavy cruisers; while the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class only carried nine 8&quot;/55 caliber Marks 12 and 15 guns,&lt;ref name=&quot;8/55 12 and 15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Alaska&quot; class carried nine 12&quot;/50 caliber guns that were as good as, if not superior to, the old 14&quot;/50 caliber gun used on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s pre-treaty battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;12/50&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Alaska&quot;s″ percentage of armor tonnage, 28.4%, was slightly less than that of fast battleships; the British &quot;King George V&quot; class, the American &quot;Iowa&quot; class, and the battlecruiser/fast battleship all had armor percentages between 32 and 33%, whereas the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class battlecruiser design had a nearly identical armor percentage of 28.5%. In fact, older battlecruisers, such as (19.9%), had a significantly lower percentage.

== Armament ==

=== Main battery ===
As built, the &quot;Alaska&quot; class had nine 12&quot;/50 caliber Mark 8 guns mounted in three triple (3-gun) turrets, with two turrets forward and one aft, a configuration known as &quot;2-A-1&quot;. The previous 12&quot; gun manufactured for the U.S. Navy was the Mark 7 version, which had been designed for and installed in the 1912 s. The Mark 8 was of considerably higher quality; in fact, it &quot;was by far the most powerful weapon of its caliber ever placed in service&quot;. Designed in 1939, it weighed including the breech, and could sustain an average rate of fire of 2.4–3 rounds a minute. It could throw a Mark 18 armor-piercing shell at an elevation of 45°, and had a 344-shot barrel life (about 54 more than the much larger but similar 16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun found on the &quot;Iowa&quot; battleships.). The &quot;Alaska&quot;s″ Mark 8 guns were the heaviest main battery of any cruiser of World War II, and as capable as the old 14&quot;/45 caliber gun used on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s pre-treaty battleships.

The turrets were very similar to those of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships, but differed in several ways; for example, the &quot;Alaska&quot; class had a two-stage powder hoist instead of the &quot;Iowa&quot; class&#x27;s one-stage hoist. These differences made operating the guns safer and increased the rate of fire. In addition, a &quot;projectile rammer&quot; was added to &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Guam&quot;. This machine transferred shells from storage on the ship to the rotating ring that fed the guns. However, this feature proved unsatisfactory, and it was not planned for &quot;Hawaii&quot; or any subsequent ships.

Because &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Guam&quot; were the only two ships to mount these guns, only ten turrets were made during the war (three for each ship including &quot;Hawaii&quot; and one spare). They cost $1,550,000 each and were the most expensive heavy guns purchased by the U.S. Navy in World War II.

=== Secondary battery ===
The secondary battery of the &quot;Alaska&quot; class was composed of twelve dual-purpose (anti-air and anti-ship) 5&quot;/38 caliber guns in twin mounts, with four offset on each side of the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5&quot;/38 was originally intended for use on only destroyers built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II it was being installed on almost all of the U.S.&#x27;s major warships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and heavy and light cruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-aircraft battery ===
Medium anti-aircraft armament (a key component of area air defence within a Task Group) on the &quot;Alaska&quot;-class ships was 56 x 40mm Bofors guns and for close-in air defence they carried 34 × 20 mm guns. These numbers may be compared with; 48 × 40 mm and 24 × 20 mm on the smaller &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class heavy cruisers, 60 x 40 mm and 36 x 20 mm on the larger battleship &quot;North Carolina&quot; at the end of the war, and 80 × 40 mm and 49 × 20 mm on the even larger &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships.

== Ships in class==
* was commissioned on 17 June 1944. She served in the Pacific, screening aircraft carriers, providing shore bombardment at Okinawa, and going on raiding missions in the East China Sea. She was decommissioned on 17 February 1947 after less than three years of service and was scrapped in 1960.
* was commissioned on 17 September 1944. She served in the Pacific with &quot;Alaska&quot; on almost all of the same operations. Along with &quot;Alaska&quot;, she was decommissioned on 17 February 1947 and was scrapped in 1961.
* was intended as a third ship of the class, but she was never completed. Numerous plans to utilize her as a guided-missile cruiser or a large command ship in the years after the war were fruitless, and she was scrapped.
* USS &quot;Philippines&quot; (CB-4), &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; (CB-5), and &quot;Samoa&quot; (CB-6) were planned as the fourth, fifth, and sixth ships of the class, respectively. All three ships were to be built at Camden, New Jersey, but they were cancelled before construction could begin.

<text>Finders Keepers is an American children&#x27;s game show that debuted on Nickelodeon in 1987 and later aired in first-run syndication starting in 1988. The show featured two teams of two children attempting to find hidden objects in different rooms of a house.

The Nickelodeon version premiered on November 2, 1987, and was hosted by Wesley Eure. Following this version&#x27;s cancellation, Larry Toffler hosted a syndicated version that premiered on September 12, 1988.

==Gameplay==

===Main Game===

The main game was played in two rounds, each with two halves. The first half of each round involved finding hidden pictures in a complex drawing, and the second half involved ransacking rooms in a large house built on-stage.

====Hidden Pictures round====

In the first half of each round, the object for the teams was to find hidden pictures drawn into a larger picture. The host read a clue, and the first team to buzz in was given a chance to find the correct object. If they failed to do so, the opposing team was given a chance to find it and steal the money.

On the Nickelodeon series, the picture was displayed on a telestrator and the teams used light pens to circle the objects on monitors set into their podiums. On the syndicated series, the picture was displayed on a large board and each team was given a set of plastic laminate stickers similar to Colorforms representing the objects. When a team buzzed in, one member had to run to the board, grab the sticker for the correct object in their color, and stick it onto the picture in the appropriate place.

Each correct item located earned $25 for the team and an opportunity to search one of four rooms in the house for that round. During the first half of the Nickelodeon series the players chose the rooms they wanted to search, but this was later changed so that each hidden object found awarded the opportunity to search a specific room.

Each picture had a maximum of six objects hidden within it. In the first half of the Nickelodeon series, an incorrect answer meant a room would go unclaimed. For the subsequent episodes and syndicated series, the round was played until all four rooms were claimed or all six clues were played, whichever came first.

====Searching the house====

The house consisted of eight rooms that could be whimsical versions of traditional rooms in a typical home (e.g., a living room, a bathroom, a den or a kitchen), or complete fantasy rooms, such as &quot;Sherlock&#x27;s Study,&quot; &quot;Ali-Baba&#x27;s bathroom&quot;, a sewer (which contained a pool of water), Tarzan&#x27;s tree house, a pastry shop, or &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s laboratory.&quot; The house was laid out with two floors of four rooms each, and a staircase ran up the middle.

In each room, the host read a clue describing an object hidden within. The team had 30 seconds to find the object, and were given one chance to show it to the host once found. If they found the item, the team won $50. If they could not, or if the object they presented was not the right one, the money went to the other team. On the Nickelodeon version, while the team was trying to find the item associated with the clue, the camera would discreetly zoom in on it. On the syndicated version, a picture of the room would appear at the bottom of the screen with the target object marked by a flashing X.

Rooms were frequently set up with distractions to hinder the teams&#x27; searches, such as ping-pong balls falling onto them from cabinets or the ceiling, sprays of water or confetti, and (in later episodes) entire shelves collapsing. However, any breakable or collapsible objects were fabricated in such a way as to prevent any injuries to the host or contestants, such as plates made from clay that had not been hardened by firing in a kiln.

====Round two====
The process repeated with a second hidden pictures round and set of rooms to search. The dollar values increased to $75 for finding a correct hidden picture and $100 for successfully finding a hidden object in a room.

One of the rooms in round two was secretly designated as the day&#x27;s &quot;Instant Prize Room.&quot; If a team won control of this room and found its hidden object, both members won a bonus prize that was theirs to keep regardless of the final outcome of the game.

The team with the most money at the end of this round won the game and advanced to the Room to Room Romp. Both teams kept all money earned, the losing team receiving consolation prizes.

====Tiebreaker====
If the scores were tied at the end of the second round, a shortened Hidden Pictures round was played as a tiebreaker. The first team to find two pictures won the game.

===Room-to-Room Romp===

In the Room-to-Room Romp, the winning team had 90 seconds to find a hidden object in each of six rooms, in a sequence given to them before the round began. All six objects had tags attached, with each of the first five tags directing them to the next room and giving a clue for the object hidden there. The clock began to run after the host finished reading the first clue, and continued to count down while the team moved from one room to another.

The team won a prize for each object found, increasing in value to a grand prize for getting through all six rooms within the time limit.

==Broadcast history==

The original version premiered on Nickelodeon on November 2, 1987, with Wesley Eure as host and John Harvey as the announcer. Harvey was later replaced by Bob Lorman and then by Joe Conklin. New episodes continued to air on Nickelodeon until July 29, 1988.

A first-run syndicated version, distributed by Fox Television Stations and Viacom premiered on September 12, 1988, and was hosted by Larry Toffler with Harry Stevens announcing. The syndicated series ended its run on March 10, 1989, and began airing in repeats on Nickelodeon the following Monday (March 13), which continued until August 25, 1990. Nick GAS re-aired the series from 1999 until 2006. The all-time winningest pair of contestants (during the syndicated version run) was Gina and Kevin (1988), who recorded a score of $975 to $25. The all-time fastest successful completion of the Room Romp (either Nickelodeon or syndicated) was accomplished by Chris and Michelle (1988), who completed the Romp in 48 seconds. 

A Brazilian version of &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, called &quot;Bobeou Dançou&quot;, aired on TV Globo from July to December 1989. This version was hosted by Brazilian star Xuxa.

A British version of &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; aired on the CITV block of ITV from 1991 to 1996, followed by a brief revival in 2006. The first five series of this version was presented by Neil Buchanan, who was joined in the last series by Diane Youdale. Jeff Brazier presented the revival.

===Production information===

The music for &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; was written by Edd Kalehoff. The music package was updated when the show went into syndication.

The Nickelodeon version of &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; was taped at WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (as was &quot;Double Dare&quot;), while the syndicated version was taped at Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles, California. The sets of the Nickelodeon and syndicated versions differed slightly. The set of the Nickelodeon version consisted of a mock exterior of a house that included a door through which Eure entered at the beginning of the show. Prior to searching the house, the set would break away to reveal the house and rooms the teams would be searching. On the syndicated version, the play area and house shared the same set, with the house built stage left and the play area stage right.

Converse was a major sponsor of the show during its run, and every contestant and stage crew member (including the host) wore a pair of the company&#x27;s shoes.

<doc id="483848" wikidata="Q6906050" url="?curid=483848" title="Montlake, Seattle">
<text>Montlake is a wealthy residential neighborhood in central Seattle, Washington. It is located along the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, bounded to the north by Portage Bay, to the east by the Washington Park Arboretum, and to the south and west by Interlaken Park. Capitol Hill is on its south and west sides, and the University of Washington campus lies across the Montlake Cut to the north. State Route 520 runs through the northern tip of Montlake, isolating four blocks from the rest of the neighborhood. The (unofficial) City Clerk&#x27;s map of Montlake considers it to extend further west, past Interlaken Park, extending to Broadway Avenue E. and, between Lynn Street and State Route 520, all the way to Interstate 5.

Though sports at the University of Washington are referred to metonymically as &quot;Montlake,&quot; UW sports facilities are not located within the traditional bounds of the neighborhood; instead, they are located on Montlake Boulevard, across the Montlake Cut from the neighborhood.

== History ==
Montlake was primarily developed by John E. Boyer and Herbert Turner (also known as H.S. Turner) from 1903 through the early 1930s. In 1916, the northern boundary of Montlake was fixed by the opening of the New Portage Canal, later known as the Montlake Cut, between Lake Washington and Lake Union. The Montlake Bridge, a distinctive bascule bridge crossing the Montlake Cut, opened in 1925.

In 1925, a Montlake neighbor made a low offer for a tiny slice of adjoining land. Out of spite for the low offer, the builder built an house at 2022 24th Avenue E. that blocked the neighbors&#x27; open space. The house is wide at the south end and wide at the north end. The Montlake Spite House still is standing and occupied.

The Montlake Community Club, an organization of neighborhood residents, has a distinguished history of grassroots activism. (Critics have called it NIMBY-ism.) Montlake first became politically active in a failed battle to move or avoid building State Route 520 through the northern section of the neighborhood and the arboretum. The neighborhood&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful and SR 520 was opened in 1963.

The Montlake Community Club lobbied to halt planning of the R.H. Thomson Expressway project of the 1960s. The expressway was to be a second north–south freeway through the city, parallel to Interstate 5 but cutting through Ravenna, Montlake, Madison Valley, and the Central District, taking out the western section of the Arboretum in the process. It was designed as a bypass around Downtown for through traffic. Interchanges with State Route 520 and I-90 were planned, the former being partially built, but the project was halted before construction went further. Never-used on- and off-ramps stood at the north end of the Arboretum until the SR 520 bridge expansion of the 2010s.

Members of the Montlake community continue to negotiate with state and local officials over planned improvements to SR 520 and other local roads. Recently, a neighborhood group called Better Bridge endorsed a proposal to expand SR 520 to six lanes, move it north, and build a lid over the existing 520 freeway to reconnect the Shelby and Hamlin blocks to the rest of the neighborhood. The proposal has been endorsed by some members of Seattle City Council but has not yet been formally approved.

Montlake saw a spike in housing prices and the demolition or renovation of several smaller homes starting in the late 1980s, as new residents bought up properties in the neighborhood because of its charm, good schools, and central location.

== Characteristics ==
The neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfares are Boyer Avenue E. (northwest- and southeast-bound), 24th Avenue E. and Lake Washington and Montlake Boulevards E. (north- and southbound), and E. Lake Washington Boulevard (east- and westbound).

Montlake has a very small commercial corridor along 24th Avenue East. It includes the Italian restaurant Cafe Lago, Mr. Johnson&#x27;s Antiques, a branch of Seattle Public Library, a small market, and dry cleaner.

The houses in Montlake are primarily single-family homes, mainly early 20th century American Craftsman bungalow and Tudor style. Also distinctive are the Old Seattle-style brick and wood frame homes of the early 20th century, particularly those bordering the Montlake Community Center.

Montlake has one church, the Greek Orthodox St. Demetrios, built in 1963 on the grounds of a former garden business called Dahlialand.

Montlake was the home of the Museum of History &amp; Industry from 1952 to 2012 and is currently the home of the Seattle Yacht Club (1920) and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (1931), part of the National Marine Fisheries Service.

Montlake&#x27;s median household income is $208,636 according to the 2019 U.S. Census 5-Year estimate, compared to $92,263 citywide.

<text>Group 5 is a group of elements in the periodic table. Group 5 contains vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta) and dubnium (Db). This group lies in the d-block of the periodic table. This group is sometimes called the vanadium group or vanadium family after its lightest member; however, the group itself has not acquired a trivial name because it belongs to the broader grouping of the transition metals.

As is typical for early transition metals, niobium and tantalum have only the group oxidation state of +5 as a major one, and are quite electropositive (it is easy to donate electrons) and have a less rich coordination chemistry (the chemistry of metallic ions bound with molecules). Due to the effects of the lanthanide contraction, the decrease in ionic radii in the lanthanides, they are very similar in properties. Vanadium is somewhat distinct due to its smaller size: it has well-defined +2, +3 and +4 states as well (although +5 is more stable).

The lighter three Group 5 elements occur naturally and share similar properties; all three are hard refractory metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, dubnium, has been synthesized in laboratories, but it has not been found occurring in nature, with half-life of the most stable isotope, dubnium-268, being only 16 hours, and other isotopes even more radioactive.

== History ==

&quot;Group 5&quot; is the new IUPAC name for this group; the old style name was &quot;group VB&quot; in the old US system (CAS) or &quot;group VA&quot; in the European system (old IUPAC). Group 5 must not be confused with the group with the old-style group crossed names of either &quot;VA&quot; (US system, CAS) or &quot;VB&quot; (European system, old IUPAC); that group is now called the pnictogens or group 15.

=== Vanadium ===

Vanadium was discovered in 1801 by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río extracted the element from a sample of Mexican &quot;brown lead&quot; ore, later named vanadinite. He found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors, and as a result he named the element &quot;panchromium&quot; (Greek: παγχρώμιο &quot;all colors&quot;). Later, Del Río renamed the element &quot;erythronium&quot; (Greek: ερυθρός &quot;red&quot;) because most of the salts turned red upon heating. In 1805, French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils, backed by del Río&#x27;s friend Baron Alexander von Humboldt, incorrectly declared that del Río&#x27;s new element was an impure sample of chromium. Del Río accepted Collet-Descotils&#x27; statement and retracted his claim.

In 1831 Swedish chemist Nils Gabriel Sefström rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores. Later that year, Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Río&#x27;s earlier work. Sefström chose a name beginning with V, which had not yet been assigned to any element. He called the element &quot;vanadium&quot; after Old Norse &quot;Vanadís&quot; (another name for the Norse Vanir goddess Freyja, whose attributes include beauty and fertility), because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces. In 1831, the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh suggested that vanadium should be renamed &quot;rionium&quot; after del Río, but this suggestion was not followed.

=== Niobium and tantalum ===

Niobium was identified by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral &quot;columbite&quot; and the new element &quot;columbium&quot; after &quot;Columbia&quot;, the poetic name for the United States. However, after the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949, the name niobium was chosen for element 41. The &quot;columbium&quot; discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum, which was first discovered in 1802 by Anders Gustav Ekeberg.

Subsequently, there was considerable confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918 g/cm, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8 g/cm, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: &quot;niobium&quot; (from Niobe) and &quot;pelopium&quot; (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements &quot;pelopium&quot;, &quot;ilmenium&quot;, and &quot;dianium&quot; were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum. Pure tantalum was not produced until 1903.

=== Dubnium ===

The last element of the group, dubnium, does not occur naturally and so must be synthesized in a laboratory. The first reported detection was by a team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), which in 1968 had produced the new element by bombarding an americium-243 target with a beam of neon-22 ions, and reported 9.4 MeV (with a half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7 MeV (&quot;t&quot;1/2 &gt; 0.05 s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities similar to those of either 256103 or 257103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to 261105 and 260105, respectively.

After observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe the spontaneous fission (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14 ms and . They assigned the former activity to 242mfAm and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (22Ne,&quot;x&quot;n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a 243Am target with 18O ions; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.

JINR then attempted an experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably 261105, or possibly 260105. This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of niobium pentachloride, rather than hafnium tetrachloride. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.

In June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1 MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103, implying that the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.

A controversy erupted on who had discovered the element, which each group suggesting its own name: the Dubna group named the element &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; after Niels Bohr, while the Berkeley group named it &quot;hahnium&quot; after Otto Hahn. Eventually a joint working party of IUPAC and IUPAP, the Transfermium Working Group, decided that credit for the discovery should be shared. After various compromises were attempted, where element 105 was called &quot;kurchatovium&quot;, &quot;joliotium&quot; and &quot;hahnium&quot;, in 1997 IUPAC officially named the element dubnium after Dubna, and &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; was eventually simplified to &quot;bohrium&quot; and used for element 107.

== Chemical properties ==

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells. (The expected 4d3 5s2 configuration for niobium is a very low-lying excited state at about 0.14 eV.)

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group (the chemistry of dubnium is not very established, but what is known appears to match expectations for a heavier congener of tantalum). All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting points (1910 °C, 2477 °C, 3017 °C). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions, similarly to trends in group 3 or group 4. The metals form different oxides: vanadium forms vanadium(II) oxide, vanadium(III) oxide, vanadium(IV) oxide and vanadium(V) oxide, niobium forms niobium(II) oxide, niobium(IV) oxide and niobium(V) oxide, but out of tantalum oxides only tantalum(V) oxide is characterized. Metal(V) oxides are generally nonreactive and act like acids rather than bases, but the lower oxides are less stable. They, however, have some unusual properties for oxides, such as high electric conductivity.

All three elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +5. Lower oxidation states are also known, but in all elements other than vanadium, they are less stable, decreasing in stability with atomic mass increase.

=== Compounds ===

==== Oxides ====
Vanadium forms oxides in the +2, +3, +4 and +5 oxidation states, forming vanadium(II) oxide (VO), vanadium(III) oxide (V2O3), vanadium(IV) oxide (VO2) and vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5). Vanadium(V) oxide or vanadium pentoxide is the most common, being precursor to most alloys and compounds of vanadium, and is also a widely used industrial catalyst.

Niobium forms oxides in the oxidation states +5 (), +4 (), and the rarer oxidation state, +2 (NbO). Most common is the pentoxide, also being precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys.

Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is the most important compound from the perspective of applications. Oxides of tantalum in lower oxidation states are numerous, including many defect structures, and are lightly studied or poorly characterized.
==== Oxyanions ====
In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) forms an extensive family of oxyanions as established by 51V NMR spectroscopy. The interrelationships in this family are described by the predominance diagram, which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration. The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, , is the principal species present at pH 12–14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. Orthovanadate V is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate. Beside that, this anion also has been shown to interact with activity of some specific enzymes. The tetrathiovanadate [VS4]3− is analogous to the orthovanadate ion.

At lower pH values, the monomer [HVO4]2− and dimer [V2O7]4− are formed, with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than c. 10−2M (pV &gt; 2, where pV is equal to the minus value of the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration/M). The formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the dichromate ion. As the pH is reduced, further protonation and condensation to polyvanadates occur: at pH 4–6 [H2VO4]− is predominant at pV greater than ca. 4, while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed. Between pH 2–4 decavanadate predominates, though its formation from orthovanadate is optimized at pH 4–7, represented by this reaction:

In decavanadate, each V(V) center is surrounded by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species [H2VO4]− results in the preferential formation of the octahedral [VO2(H2O)4]+ species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH &lt; 2, [VO2(H2O)4]+ is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the acid anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.

Vanadium(V) forms various peroxo complexes, most notably in the active site of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase enzymes. The species VO(O)2(H2O)4+ is stable in acidic solutions. In alkaline solutions, species with 2, 3 and 4 peroxide groups are known; the last forms violet salts with the formula M3V(O2)4 nH2O (M= Li, Na, etc.), in which the vanadium has an 8-coordinate dodecahedral structure.

Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides. Examples are lithium niobate () and lanthanum niobate (). In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted perovskite-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone ions.

Tantalates, compounds containing [TaO4]3− or [TaO3]− are numerous. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) adopts a perovskite structure. Lanthanum tantalate (LaTaO4) contains isolated tetrahedra.

==== Halides and their derivatives ====

Twelve binary halides, compounds with the formula VXn (n=2...5), are known. VI4, VCl5, VBr5, and VI5 do not exist or are extremely unstable; the only known pure V halide compound is . In combination with other reagents, VCl4 is used as a catalyst for polymerization of dienes. Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are Lewis acidic, especially those of V(IV) and V(V). Many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula VX&quot;n&quot;L6−&quot;n&quot; (X= halide; L= other ligand).

Many vanadium oxyhalides (formula VOmXn) are known. The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride (VOCl3 and VOF3) are the most widely studied. Akin to POCl3, they are volatile, adopt tetrahedral structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis acidic.


Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of +5 and +4 as well as diverse substoichiometric compounds. The pentahalides () feature octahedral Nb centres. Niobium pentafluoride () is a white solid with a melting point of 79.0 °C and niobium pentachloride () is yellow (see image at left) with a melting point of 203.4 °C. Both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides, such as . The pentachloride is a versatile reagent used to generate the organometallic compounds, such as niobocene dichloride (). The tetrahalides () are dark-coloured polymers with Nb-Nb bonds; for example, the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride () and dark violet niobium tetrachloride ().

Anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known, owing in part to the Lewis acidity of the pentahalides. The most important is [NbF7]2−, an intermediate in the separation of Nb and Ta from the ores. This heptafluoride tends to form the oxopentafluoride more readily than does the tantalum compound. Other halide complexes include octahedral []:
: + 2 Cl → 2 []

As with other metals with low atomic numbers, a variety of reduced halide cluster ions is known, the prime example being [].

Tantalum halides span the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0 °C. The anion [TaF7]2- is used for its separation from niobium. The chloride , which exists as a dimer, is the main reagent in synthesis of new Ta compounds. It hydrolyzes readily to an oxychloride. The lower halides and , feature Ta-Ta bonds.

== Physical properties ==

The trends in group 5 follow those of the other early d-block groups and reflect the addition of a filled f-shell into the core in passing from the fifth to the sixth period. All the stable members of the group are silvery-blue refractory metals, though impurities of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen make them brittle. They all crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure at room temperature, and dubnium is expected to do the same.

The table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 5 elements. The question-marked value is predicted.

=== Vanadium ===

Vanadium is an average-hard, ductile, steel-blue metal. It is electrically conductive and thermally insulating. Some sources describe vanadium as &quot;soft&quot;, perhaps because it is ductile, malleable, and not brittle. Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses of the elements (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is oxidized in air at about 933 K (660 °C, 1220 °F), although an oxide passivation layer forms even at room temperature.

=== Niobium ===

Niobium is a lustrous, grey, ductile, paramagnetic metal in group 5 of the periodic table (see table), with an electron configuration in the outermost shells atypical for group 5. Similarly atypical configurations occur in the neighborhood of ruthenium (44) and rhodium (45).

Although it is thought to have a body-centered cubic crystal structure from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. 

Niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at 9.2 K. Niobium has the greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element. In addition, it is one of the three elemental Type II superconductors, along with vanadium and technetium. The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal.

When very pure, it is comparatively soft and ductile, but impurities make it harder.

The metal has a low capture cross-section for thermal neutrons; thus it is used in the nuclear industries where neutron transparent structures are desired.

=== Tantalum ===

Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150 °C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum&#x27;s high melting point of 3017 °C (boiling point 5458 °C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium osmium, and carbon. 

Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft; it has body-centered cubic structure (space group &quot;Im3m&quot;, lattice constant &quot;a&quot; = 0.33058 nm), Knoop hardness 200–400 HN and electrical resistivity 15–60 μΩ⋅cm. The beta phase is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal (space group &quot;P42/mnm&quot;, &quot;a&quot; = 1.0194 nm, &quot;c&quot; = 0.5313 nm), Knoop hardness is 1000–1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170–210 μΩ⋅cm. The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750–775 °C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase, and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron
sputtering, chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from a eutectic molten salt solution.

=== Dubnium ===
A direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6 eV.

A more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.
Another effect is the spin–orbit interaction, particularly spin–orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell—the azimuthal quantum number ℓ of a d shell is 2—into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d3/2.)

A single ionized atom of dubnium (Db+) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium&#x27;s chemistry.

Atoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a body-centered cubic configuration, like the previous group 5 elements. The predicted density of dubnium is 21.6 g/cm3.

== Occurrence ==

There are 160 parts per million of vanadium in the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 19th most abundant element. Soil contains on average 100 parts per million of vanadium, and seawater contains 1.5 parts per billion of vanadium. A typical human contains 285 parts per billion of vanadium. Over 60 vanadium ores are known, including vanadinite, patronite, and carnotite. There are 20 parts per million of niobium in the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 33rd most abundant element there. Soil contains on average 24 parts per million of niobium, and seawater contains 900 parts per quadrillion of niobium. A typical human contains 21 parts per billion of niobium. Niobium is in the minerals columbite and pyrochlore. There are 2 parts per million of tantalum in the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 51st most abundant element there. Soil contains on average 1 to 2 parts per billion of tantalum, and seawater contains 2 parts per trillion of tantalum. A typical human contains 2.9 parts per billion of tantalum. Tantalum is found in the minerals tantalite and pyrochlore. Dubnium does not occur naturally in the Earth&#x27;s crust, as it has no stable isotopes.

== Production ==

=== Vanadium ===

Vanadium metal is obtained by a multistep process that begins with roasting crushed ore with NaCl or Na2CO3 at about 850 °C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO3). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to produce &quot;red cake&quot;, a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also used, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes. Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves the formation of the metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal:
:2 V + 3 I2 2 VI3

Most vanadium is used as a component of a steel alloy called ferrovanadium. Ferrovanadium is produced directly by reducing a mixture of vanadium oxide, iron oxides and iron in an electric furnace. The vanadium ends up in pig iron produced from vanadium-bearing magnetite. Depending on the ore used, the slag contains up to 25% of vanadium.

Approximately 70000 tonnes of vanadium ore are produced yearly, with 25000 t of vanadium ore being produced in Russia, 24000 in South Africa, 19000 in China, and 1000 in Kazakhstan. 7000 t of vanadium metal are produced each year. It is impossible to obtain vanadium by heating its ore with carbon. Instead, vanadium is produced by heating vanadium oxide with calcium in a pressure vessel. Very high-purity vanadium is produced from a reaction of vanadium trichloride with magnesium.

=== Niobium and tantalum ===

After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum  and niobium  are obtained. To produce niobium, the first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with hydrofluoric acid:
:

The first industrial scale separation, developed by Swiss chemist de Marignac, exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate () and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate () in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents like cyclohexanone. The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the organic solvent with water and either precipitated by the addition of potassium fluoride to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with ammonia as the pentoxide:

Followed by:

Several methods are used for the reduction to metallic niobium. The electrolysis of a molten mixture of [] and sodium chloride is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with sodium. With this method, a relatively high purity niobium can be obtained. In large scale production, is reduced with hydrogen or carbon. In the aluminothermic reaction, a mixture of iron oxide and niobium oxide is reacted with aluminium:

Small amounts of oxidizers like sodium nitrate are added to enhance the reaction. The result is aluminium oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in steel production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.

, CBMM from Brazil controlled 85 percent of the world&#x27;s niobium production. The United States Geological Survey estimates that the production increased from 38,700 tonnes in 2005 to 44,500tonnes in 2006. Worldwide resources are estimated to be 4.4 million tonnes. During the ten-year period between 1995 and 2005, the production more than doubled, starting from 17,800 tonnes in 1995. Between 2009 and 2011, production was stable at 63,000tonnes per year, with a slight decrease in 2012 to only 50,000tonnes per year.

70,000tonnes of tantalum ore are produced yearly. Brazil produces 90% of tantalum ore, with Canada, Australia, China, and Rwanda also producing the element. The demand for tantalum is around 1,200tonnes per year.

=== Dubnium and beyond ===
Dubnium is produced synthetically by bombarding actinides with lighter elements. To date, no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize the next member of the group, either unpentseptium (Ups) or unpentennium (Upe). As unpentseptium and unpentennium are both late period 8 elements, it is unlikely that these elements will be synthesized in the near future; current attempts have only been made on elements up to atomic number 127.

== Applications ==

Vanadium&#x27;s main application is in alloys, such as vanadium steel. Vanadium alloys are used in springs, tools, jet engines, armor plating, and nuclear reactors. Vanadium oxide gives ceramics a golden color, and other vanadium compounds are used as catalysts to produce polymers.

Small amounts of niobium are added to stainless steel to improve its quality. Niobium alloys are also used in rocket nozzles because of niobium&#x27;s high corrosion resistance.

Tantalum has four main types of applications. Tantalum is added into objects exposed to high temperatures, in electronic devices, in surgical implants, and for handling corrosive substances.

Dubnium has no applications due to the difficulty of its synthesis and the very short half-lives of even its longest-lived isotopes.

== Biological occurrences ==
Out of the group 5 elements, only vanadium has been identified as playing a role in the biological chemistry of living systems, but even it plays a very limited role in biology, and is more important in ocean environments than on land.

Vanadium, essential to ascidians and tunicates as vanabins, has been known in the blood cells of Ascidiacea (sea squirts) since 1911, in concentrations of vanadium in their blood more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them. Several species of macrofungi accumulate vanadium (up to 500 mg/kg in dry weight). Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase generates organobromine compounds in a number of species of marine algae.

Rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired reproduction. Vanadium is a relatively controversial dietary supplement, primarily for increasing insulin sensitivity and body-building. Vanadyl sulfate may improve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes. In addition, decavanadate and oxovanadates are species that potentially have many biological activities and that have been successfully used as tools in the comprehension of several biochemical processes.

== Toxicity and precautions ==

Pure vanadium is not known to be toxic. However, vanadium pentoxide causes severe irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Tetravalent VOSO4 has been reported to be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death. Vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation of vanadium and vanadium compounds results primarily in adverse effects on the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters, liver, neurological development, and other organs in rats.

There is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are the main fuel component in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530 °C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.

Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is often used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants. Niobium and its compounds thought to be slightly toxic. Short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two water-soluble chemicals, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD) between 10 and 100 mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD after seven days of 940 mg/kg.

Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory, and it and its compounds rarely cause injury, and when they do, the injuries are normally rashes. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound. People can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10 mg/m3. At levels of 2500 mg/m3, tantalum is immediately dangerous to life and health.

<text>A cloud chamber, also known as a Wilson chamber, is a particle detector used for visualizing the passage of ionizing radiation.

A cloud chamber consists of a sealed environment containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. An energetic charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the gaseous mixture by knocking electrons off gas molecules via electrostatic forces during collisions, resulting in a trail of ionized gas particles. The resulting ions act as condensation centers around which a mist-like trail of small droplets form if the gas mixture is at the point of condensation. These droplets are visible as a &quot;cloud&quot; track that persists for several seconds while the droplets fall through the vapor. These tracks have characteristic shapes. For example, an alpha particle track is thick and straight, while a beta particle track is wispy and shows more evidence of deflections by collisions. 

Cloud chambers were invented in the early 1900s by the Scottish physicist Charles Thomson Rees Wilson. They played a prominent role in experimental particle physics from the 1920s to the 1950s, until the advent of the bubble chamber. In particular, the discoveries of the positron in 1932 (see Fig. 1) and the muon in 1936, both by Carl Anderson (awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936), used cloud chambers. The Discovery of the kaon by George Rochester and Clifford Charles Butler in 1947 was made using a cloud chamber as the detector. In each of these cases, cosmic rays were the source of ionizing radiation. Yet they were also used with artificial sources of particles, for example in radiography applications as part of the Manhattan Project.

== Invention ==
Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869–1959), a Scottish physicist, is credited with inventing the cloud chamber. Inspired by sightings of the Brocken spectre while working on the summit of Ben Nevis in 1894, he began to develop expansion chambers for studying cloud formation and optical phenomena in moist air. Very rapidly he discovered that ions could act as centers for water droplet formation in such chambers. He pursued the application of this discovery and perfected the first cloud chamber in 1911.

In Wilson&#x27;s original chamber, the air inside the sealed device was saturated with water vapor, then a diaphragm was used to expand the air inside the chamber (adiabatic expansion), cooling the air and starting to condense water vapor. Hence the name expansion cloud chamber is used. When an ionizing particle passes through the chamber, water vapor condenses on the resulting ions and the trail of the particle is visible in the vapor cloud. A cine film was used to record the images. 

Further developments were made by Patrick Blackett who utilised a stiff spring to expand and compress the chamber very rapidly, making the chamber sensitive to particles several times a second. This kind of chamber is also called a pulsed chamber because the conditions for operation are not continuously maintained.

Wilson received half the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his work on the cloud chamber (the same year as Arthur Compton received half the prize for the Compton Effect).

The diffusion cloud chamber was developed in 1936 by Alexander Langsdorf. This chamber differs from the expansion cloud chamber in that it is continuously sensitized to radiation, and in that the bottom must be cooled to a rather low temperature, generally colder than . Instead of water vapor, alcohol is used because of its lower freezing point. Cloud chambers cooled by dry ice or Peltier effect thermoelectric cooling are common demonstration and hobbyist devices; the alcohol used in them is commonly isopropyl alcohol or methylated spirit.

==Structure and operation==



Diffusion-type cloud chambers will be discussed here. A simple cloud chamber consists of the sealed environment, a warm top plate and a cold bottom plate (See Fig. 3). It requires a source of liquid alcohol at the warm side of the chamber where the liquid evaporates, forming a vapor that cools as it falls through the gas and condenses on the cold bottom plate. Some sort of ionizing radiation is needed.

Isopropanol, methanol, or other alcohol vapor saturates the chamber. The alcohol falls as it cools down and the cold condenser provides a steep temperature gradient. The result is a supersaturated environment. As energetic charged particles pass through the gas they leave ionization trails. The alcohol vapor condenses around gaseous ion trails left behind by the ionizing particles. This occurs because alcohol and water molecules are polar, resulting in a net attractive force toward a nearby free charge (See Fig. 4). The result is a misty cloud-like formation, seen by the presence of droplets falling down to the condenser. When the tracks are emitted from a source, their point of origin can easily be determined. Fig. 5 shows an example of an alpha particle from a Pb-210 pin-type source undergoing Rutherford scattering.

Just above the cold condenser plate there is a volume of the chamber which is sensitive to ionization tracks. The ion trail left by the radioactive particles provides an optimal trigger for condensation and cloud formation. This sensitive volume is increased in height by employing a steep temperature gradient, and stable conditions. A strong electric field is often used to draw cloud tracks down to the sensitive region of the chamber and increase the sensitivity of the chamber. The electric field can also serve to prevent large amounts of background &quot;rain&quot; from obscuring the sensitive region of the chamber, caused by condensation forming above the sensitive volume of the chamber, thereby obscuring tracks by constant precipitation. A black background makes it easier to observe cloud tracks, and typically a tangential light source is needed to illuminate the white droplets against the black background. Often the tracks are not apparent until a shallow pool of alcohol is formed at the condenser plate. 

If a magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber, positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions, according to the Lorentz force law; strong-enough fields are difficult to achieve, however, with small hobbyist setups. This method was also used to prove the existence of the Positron in 1932, in accordance with Paul Dirac&#x27;s theoretical proof, published in 1928.

==Other particle detectors==

The bubble chamber was invented by Donald A. Glaser of the United States in 1952, and for this, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1960. The bubble chamber similarly reveals the tracks of subatomic particles, but inverts the principle of the cloud chamber to detect them as trails of bubbles in a superheated liquid, usually liquid hydrogen, rather than as trails of drops in a supercritical vapor. Bubble chambers can be made physically larger than cloud chambers, and since they are filled with much-denser liquid material, they can reveal the tracks of much more energetic particles. These factors rapidly made the bubble chamber the predominant particle detector for a number of decades, so that cloud chambers were effectively superseded in fundamental research by the start of the 1960s.

A spark chamber is an electrical device that uses a grid of uninsulated electric wires in a gas-filled chamber, with high voltages applied between the wires. Energetic charged particles cause ionization of the gas along the path of the particle in the same way as in the Wilson cloud chamber, but in this case the ambient electric fields are high enough to precipitate full-scale gas breakdown in the form of sparks at the position of the initial ionization. The presence and location of these sparks is then registered electrically, and the information is stored for later analysis, such as by a digital computer.

Similar condensation effects can be observed as Wilson clouds, also called condensation clouds, at large explosions in humid air and other Prandtl–Glauert singularity effects.

<text>Mary Ellen Greenfield (December 27, 1930 – May 13, 1999), known as Meg Greenfield, was an American editorial writer who worked for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. She was also a Washington, D.C., insider, known for her wit. Greenfield won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing.

A book she authored was published posthumously.

==Life and career==
Greenfield was born in Seattle, the daughter of Lorraine (Nathan) and Lewis James Greenfield. Her family was Jewish. She attended The Bush School and graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952. She also studied at Cambridge University as a Fulbright Scholar and was friends there with Norman Podhoretz, who also went on to a career in journalism.

From 1954 until her death in 1999, she was married to James Greenfield.

She became influential in a male-dominated world and a close confidante of &quot;Post&quot; publisher Katharine Graham. She spent 20 years as the editorial page editor for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and 25 years as a columnist for Newsweek. She influenced generations of Washington Post writers.

When diagnosed with cancer, Greenfield partly retired to Bainbridge Island in her native Washington, where she wrote a posthumously published memoir entitled &quot;Washington&quot;. She died of the disease, at age 68.

Greenfield was portrayed by Carrie Coon in 2017 film, &quot;The Post&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

<text>The Olympic Peninsula is a large arm of land in Western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle, and contains Olympic National Park. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the east by Hood Canal. Cape Alava, the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point, are on the peninsula. Comprising about , the Olympic Peninsula contained many of the last unexplored places in the contiguous United States. It remained largely unmapped until Arthur Dodwell and Theodore Rixon mapped most of its topography and timber resources between 1898 and 1900.

==Geography==
Clallam and Jefferson Counties, as well as the northern parts of Grays Harbor and Mason Counties, are on the peninsula. The Kitsap Peninsula, bounded by the Hood Canal and Puget Sound, is an entirely separate peninsula and is not connected to the Olympic Peninsula.

From Olympia, the state capital, U.S. Route 101 runs along the Olympic Peninsula&#x27;s eastern, northern, and western shorelines.

The Olympic mountain range sits in the center of the Olympic Peninsula. This range is the second largest in Washington State. Its highest peak is Mt. Olympus.

A major effort called the Wild Olympics campaign is under way to protect additional wilderness areas on the Olympic Peninsula, protect salmon streams under the Wild and Scenic River Act and provide a means for Olympic National Park to offer to buy land adjacent to the Park from willing sellers.

===Climate===
Most of the peninsula has an oceanic climate, or &quot;Cfb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification. Most populated areas, however, have a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, or &quot;Csb&quot;.

The Olympic Peninsula is home to temperate rain forests, including the Hoh, Queets Rain Forest, and Quinault. Rain forest vegetation is concentrated primarily in the western part of the peninsula, as the interior mountains create a rain shadow effect in areas to the northeast, resulting in a much drier climate in those locales.

===Rivers===
Major salmon-bearing rivers on the Olympic Peninsula include, clockwise from the southwest, the Humptulips, the Quinault, the Queets, the Quillayute, Bogachiel, the Sol Duc, the Lyre, the Elwha (see Elwha Ecosystem Restoration), the Dungeness, the Dosewallips, the Hamma Hamma, the Skokomish, and the Wynoochee River.

===Lakes===
Natural lakes on the peninsula include Lake Crescent, Lake Ozette, Lake Sutherland, Lake Quinault, and Lake Pleasant. Two dammed rivers form the reservoirs of Lake Cushman and Wynoochee Lake; two previous reservoirs, destroyed in the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration were Lake Aldwell (behind the former Elwha Dam) and Lake Mills (behind the former Glines Canyon Dam).

===Parks===
The peninsula contains many state and national parks, including Anderson Lake, Bogachiel, Dosewallips, Fort Flagler, Fort Worden, Lake Cushman, Mystery Bay, Old Fort Townsend, Potlatch, Sequim Bay, Shine Tidelands, and Triton Cove state parks; Olympic National Park; and the Olympic National Forest. Within the Olympic National Forest, there are five designated wilderness areas: The Brothers, Buckhorn, Colonel Bob, Mt. Skokomish, and Wonder Mountain. Just off the west coast is the Washington Islands Wilderness.

== Politics ==
The Olympic Peninsula is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Democrat Derek Kilmer. It is represented in the Washington State Legislature by Democratic state senator Kevin Van De Wege and Democratic state representatives Mike Chapman and Steve Tharinger.

<doc id="483861" wikidata="Q202602" url="?curid=483861" title="Group 7 element">
<text>Group 7, numbered by IUPAC nomenclature, is a group of elements in the periodic table. It contains manganese (Mn), technetium (Tc), rhenium (Re) and bohrium (Bh). This group lies in the d-block of the periodic table, and are hence transition metals. This group is sometimes called the manganese group or manganese family after its lightest member; however, the group itself has not acquired a trivial name because it belongs to the broader grouping of the transition metals.

The group 7 elements tend to have a major group oxidation state (+7), although this trend is markedly less coherent than the previous groups. Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior. In nature, manganese is a fairly common element, whereas rhenium is rare, technetium only occurs in trace quantities, and bohrium is entirely synthetic.

== Physical properties ==

The trends in group 7 follow, although less noticeably, those of the other early d-block groups and reflect the addition of a filled f-shell into the core in passing from the fifth to the sixth period. All group 7 elements crystallize in the hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure except manganese, which crystallizes in the body centered cubic (bcc) structure. Bohrium is also expected to crystallize in the hcp structure.

The table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 7 elements. The question-marked value is predicted.

== Chemical properties ==

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells:

All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states.

Bohrium may therefore also show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohrate, BhO4−, analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).

== Compounds ==

=== Oxides ===

==== Manganese ====

Manganese forms a variety of oxides: MnO, Mn3O4, Mn2O3, MnO2, MnO3 and Mn2O7. Manganese(II) oxide is an inorganic compound that forms green crystals. Like many monoxides, MnO adopts the rock salt structure, where cations and anions are both octahedrally coordinated. Also like many oxides, manganese(II) oxide is often nonstoichiometric: its composition can vary from MnO to MnO1.045.
Manganese(II,III) oxide is formed when any manganese oxide is heated in air above 1000 °C. Considerable research has centred on producing nanocrystalline Mn3O4 and various syntheses that involve oxidation of MnII or reduction of MnVI. Manganese(III) oxide is unlike many other transition metal oxides in that it does not adopt the corundum (Al2O3) structure. Two forms are generally recognized, α-Mn2O3 and γ-Mn2O3, although a high pressure form with the CaIrO3 structure has been reported too. Manganese(IV) oxide is a blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for MnO2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc–carbon battery. Manganese(VII) oxide is dark green in its crystalline form. The liquid is green by reflected light and red by transmitted light. It is soluble in carbon tetrachloride, and decomposes when in contact with water.

==== Technetium ====

Technetium&#x27;s main oxides are technetium(IV) oxide and technetium(VII) oxide. Technetium(IV) oxide was first produced in 1949 by electrolyzing a solution of ammonium pertechnetate under ammonium hydroxide. It has often been used to separate technetium from molybdenum and rhenium. More efficient ways are the reduction of ammonium pertechnetate by zinc metal and hydrochloric acid, stannous chloride, hydrazine, hydroxylamine, ascorbic acid, by the hydrolysis of potassium hexachlorotechnetate or by the decomposition of ammonium pertechnetate at 700 °C under an inert atmosphere. It reacts with oxygen to produce technetium(VII) oxide at 450 °C.

Technetium(VII) oxide can be prepared directly by the oxidation of technetium at 450-500 °C. It is a rare example of a molecular binary metal oxide. Other examples are ruthenium(VIII) oxide and osmium(VIII) oxide. It adopts a centrosymmetric corner-shared bi-tetrahedral structure in which the terminal and bridging Tc−O bonds are 167pm and 184 pm respectively and the Tc−O−Tc angle is 180°.

==== Rhenium ====

Rhenium&#x27;s main oxides are rhenium(IV) oxide and rhenium(VII) oxide. Rhenium(IV) oxide is a gray to black crystalline solid that can be formed by comproportionation. At high temperatures it undergoes disproportionation. It is a laboratory reagent that can be used as a catalyst. It adopts the rutile structure. It forms perrhenates with alkaline hydrogen peroxide and oxidizing acids. In molten sodium hydroxide it forms sodium rhenate:

: 2NaOH + ReO2 → Na2ReO3 + H2O

Rhenium(VII) oxide can be formed when rhenium or its oxides or sulfides are oxidized a 500-700 °C in air. It dissolves in water to give perrhenic acid. Heating Re2O7 gives rhenium(IV) oxide, signalled by the appearance of the dark blue coloration. In its solid form, Re2O7 consists of alternating octahedral and tetrahedral Re centres. It is the raw material for all rhenium compounds, being the volatile fraction obtained upon roasting the host ore.

Rhenium, in addition to the +4 and +7 oxidation states, also forms a trioxide. It can be formed by reducing rhenium(VII) oxide with carbon monoxide at 200 C or elemental rhenium at 4000 C. It can also be reduced with dioxane. It is a red solid with a metallic lustre that resembles copper in appearance, and is the only stable trioxide of the group 7 elements.

=== Halides ===

==== Manganese ====

Manganese can form compounds in the +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states. The manganese(II) compounds are often light pink solids. Like some other metal difluorides, MnF2 crystallizes in the rutile structure, which features octahedral Mn centers. and it is used in the manufacture of special kinds of glass and lasers. Scacchite is the natural, anhydrous form of manganese(II) chloride. The only other currently known mineral systematized as manganese chloride is kempite - a representative of the atacamite group, a group of hydroxide-chlorides. It can be used in place of palladium in the Stille reaction, which couples two carbon atoms using an organotin compound. It can be used as a pink pigment or as a source of the manganese ion or iodide ion. It is often used in the lighting industry.

==== Technetium ====

The following binary (containing only two elements) technetium halides are known: TcF6, TcF5, TcCl4, TcBr4, TcBr3, α-TcCl3, β-TcCl3, TcI3, α-TcCl2, and β-TcCl2. The oxidation states range from Tc(VI) to Tc(II). Technetium halides exhibit different structure types, such as molecular octahedral complexes, extended chains, layered sheets, and metal clusters arranged in a three-dimensional network. These compounds are produced by combining the metal and halogen or by less direct reactions.

TcCl4 is obtained by chlorination of Tc metal or Tc2O7 Upon heating, TcCl4 gives the corresponding Tc(III) and Tc(II) chlorides.
:TcCl4 → α-TcCl3 + 1/2 Cl2
:TcCl3 → β-TcCl2 + 1/2 Cl2
The structure of TcCl4 is composed of infinite zigzag chains of edge-sharing TcCl6 octahedra. It is isomorphous to transition metal tetrachlorides of zirconium, hafnium, and platinum.
Two polymorphs of technetium trichloride exist, α- and β-TcCl3. The α polymorph is also denoted as Tc3Cl9. It adopts a confacial bioctahedral structure. It is prepared by treating the chloro-acetate Tc2(O2CCH3)4Cl2 with HCl. Like Re3Cl9, the structure of the α-polymorph consists of triangles with short M-M distances. β-TcCl3 features octahedral Tc centers, which are organized in pairs, as seen also for molybdenum trichloride. TcBr3 does not adopt the structure of either trichloride phase. Instead it has the structure of molybdenum tribromide, consisting of chains of confacial octahedra with alternating short and long Tc—Tc contacts. TcI3 has the same structure as the high temperature phase of TiI3, featuring chains of confacial octahedra with equal Tc—Tc contacts.

Several anionic technetium halides are known. The binary tetrahalides can be converted to the hexahalides [TcX6]2− (X = F, Cl, Br, I), which adopt octahedral molecular geometry. More reduced halides form anionic clusters with Tc–Tc bonds. The situation is similar for the related elements of Mo, W, Re. These clusters have the nuclearity Tc4, Tc6, Tc8, and Tc13. The more stable Tc6 and Tc8 clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds. Every technetium atom makes six bonds, and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two bridging ligand halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine.

==== Rhenium ====

The most common rhenium chlorides are ReCl6, ReCl5, ReCl4, and ReCl3. The structures of these compounds often feature extensive Re-Re bonding, which is characteristic of this metal in oxidation states lower than VII. Salts of [Re2Cl8]2− feature a quadruple metal-metal bond. Although the highest rhenium chloride features Re(VI), fluorine gives the d0 Re(VII) derivative rhenium heptafluoride. Bromides and iodides of rhenium are also well known.

Like tungsten and molybdenum, with which it shares chemical similarities, rhenium forms a variety of oxyhalides. The oxychlorides are most common, and include ReOCl4, ReOCl3.

=== Organometallic compounds ===

==== Manganese ====

Organomanganese compounds were first reported in 1937 by Gilman and Bailee who described the reaction of phenyllithium and manganese(II) iodide to form phenylmanganese iodide (PhMnI) and diphenylmanganese (Ph2Mn).

Following this precedent, other organomanganese halides can be obtained by alkylation of manganese(II) chloride, manganese(II) bromide, and manganese(II) iodide. Manganese iodide is attractive because the anhydrous compound can be prepared in situ from manganese and iodine in ether. Typical alkylating agents are organolithium or organomagnesium compounds.

The chemistry of organometallic compounds of Mn(II) are unusual among the transition metals due to the high ionic character of the Mn(II)-C bond. The reactivity of organomanganese compounds can be compared to that of organomagnesium and organozinc compounds. The electronegativity of Mn (1.55) is comparable to that of Mg (1.31) and Zn (1.65), making the carbon atom (EN = 2.55) nucleophilic. The reduction potential of Mn is also intermediate between Mg and Zn.

==== Technetium ====


Technetium forms a variety of coordination complexes with organic ligands. Many have been well-investigated because of their relevance to nuclear medicine.

Technetium forms a variety of compounds with Tc–C bonds, i.e. organotechnetium complexes. Prominent members of this class are complexes with CO, arene, and cyclopentadienyl ligands. The binary carbonyl Tc2(CO)10 is a white volatile solid. In this molecule, two technetium atoms are bound to each other; each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands. The bond length between technetium atoms, 303 pm, is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium (272 pm). Similar carbonyls are formed by technetium&#x27;s congeners, manganese and rhenium. Interest in organotechnetium compounds has also been motivated by applications in nuclear medicine. Unusual for other metal carbonyls, Tc forms aquo-carbonyl complexes, prominent being [Tc(CO)3(H2O)3]+.

==== Rhenium ====

Dirhenium decacarbonyl is the most common entry to organorhenium chemistry. Its reduction with sodium amalgam gives Na[Re(CO)5] with rhenium in the formal oxidation state −1. Dirhenium decacarbonyl can be oxidised with bromine to bromopentacarbonylrhenium(I):
:Re2(CO)10 + Br2 → 2 Re(CO)5Br

Reduction of this pentacarbonyl with zinc and acetic acid gives pentacarbonylhydridorhenium:
:Re(CO)5Br + Zn + HOAc → Re(CO)5H + ZnBr(OAc)

Methylrhenium trioxide (&quot;MTO&quot;), CH3ReO3 is a volatile, colourless solid has been used as a catalyst in some laboratory experiments. It can be prepared by many routes, a typical method is the reaction of Re2O7 and tetramethyltin:
:Re2O7 + (CH3)4Sn → CH3ReO3 + (CH3)3SnOReO3
Analogous alkyl and aryl derivatives are known. MTO catalyses for the oxidations with hydrogen peroxide. Terminal alkynes yield the corresponding acid or ester, internal alkynes yield diketones, and alkenes give epoxides. MTO also catalyses the conversion of aldehydes and diazoalkanes into an alkene.

=== Polyoxometalates ===

The polyoxotechnetate (polyoxometalate of technetium) contains both Tc(V) and Tc(VII) in ratio 4: 16 and is obtained as the hydronium salt [H7O3]4[Tc20O68]·4H2O by concentrating an HTcO4 solution. The first empirically isolated polyoxorhenate was the white [Re4O15]2− and contained Re(VII) in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination.

== History ==

=== Manganese ===
Manganese dioxide, which is abundant in nature, has long been used as a pigment. The cave paintings in Gargas that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old are made from the mineral form of MnO2 pigments. Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove, color from glass. Use as &quot;glassmakers soap&quot; continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th-century glass from Venice.

=== Technetium and rhenium ===

Rhenium ( meaning: &quot;Rhine&quot;) was the last-discovered of the elements that have a stable isotope (other new elements discovered in nature since then, such as francium, are radioactive). The existence of a yet-undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been first predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev. Other calculated information was obtained by Henry Moseley in 1914. In 1908, Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa announced that he had discovered the 43rd element and named it &quot;nipponium&quot; (Np) after Japan (&quot;Nippon&quot; in Japanese). In fact, what he had was rhenium (element 75), not technetium. The symbol Np was later used for the element neptunium, and the name &quot;nihonium&quot;, also named after Japan, along with symbol Nh, was later used for element 113. Element 113 was also discovered by a team of Japanese scientists and was named in respectful homage to Ogawa&#x27;s work.

Rhenium was rediscovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Noddack, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they reported that they had detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660 kg of molybdenite. It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the United States was used for research and the development of refractory metal alloys. It took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used.

The discovery of element 43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè. In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first Columbia University in New York and then the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive. Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron.

=== Bohrium ===

Two groups claimed discovery of the element bohrium. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Soviet research team led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of bismuth-209 and lead-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 and manganese-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, and the other with an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter dubnium-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at Darmstadt in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.

In 1981, a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research (GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce five atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:

This discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of fermium and californium. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.

== Occurrence and production ==

=== Manganese ===
Manganese comprises about 1000 ppm (0.1%) of the Earth&#x27;s crust and is the 12th most abundant element. Soil contains 7–9000 ppm of manganese with an average of 440 ppm. The atmosphere contains 0.01 μg/m3. Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO2), braunite (Mn2+Mn3+6)(SiO12), psilomelane , and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite (MnCO3).

The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores, such as sphalerite. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.

In South Africa, most identified deposits are located near Hotazel in the Northern Cape Province, with a 2011 estimate of 15 billion tons. In 2011 South Africa produced 3.4 million tons, topping all other nations.

Manganese is mainly mined in South Africa, Australia, China, Gabon, Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Ghana, Ukraine and Malaysia.

For the production of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for the production of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.
A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing (a low grade) manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850 °C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide (MnO2) to form iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH)) and elemental manganese (Mn):

This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.

In 1972 the CIA&#x27;s Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, commissioned the ship &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine, the K-129, with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books.

An abundant resource of manganese in the form of Mn nodules found on the ocean floor. These nodules, which are composed of 29% manganese, are located along the ocean floor and the potential impact of mining these nodules is being researched. Physical, chemical, and biological environmental impacts can occur due to this nodule mining disturbing the seafloor and causing sediment plumes to form. This suspension includes metals and inorganic nutrients, which can lead to contamination of the near-bottom waters from dissolved toxic compounds. Mn nodules are also the grazing grounds, living space, and protection for endo- and epifaunal systems. When theses nodules are removed, these systems are directly affected. Overall, this can cause species to leave the area or completely die off. Prior to the commencement of the mining itself, research is being conducted by United Nations affiliated bodies and state-sponsored companies in an attempt to fully understand environmental impacts in the hopes of mitigating these impacts.

=== Technetium ===
Technetium was created by bombarding molybdenum atoms with deuterons that had been accelerated by a device called a cyclotron. Technetium occurs naturally in the Earth&#x27;s crust in minute concentrations of about 0.003 parts per trillion. Technetium is so rare because the half-lives of 97Tc and 98Tc are only 4.2 million years. More than a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the Earth, so the probability of survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1 nanogram (10−9 g) equivalent to ten trillion atoms of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red giants are known informally as technetium stars.

=== Rhenium ===

Rhenium is one of the rarest elements in Earth&#x27;s crust with an average concentration of 1 ppb; other sources quote the number of 0.5 ppb making it the 77th most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust. Rhenium is probably not found free in nature (its possible natural occurrence is uncertain), but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral molybdenite (which is primarily molybdenum disulfide), the major commercial source, although single molybdenite samples with up to 1.88% have been found. Chile has the world&#x27;s largest rhenium reserves, part of the copper ore deposits, and was the leading producer as of 2005. It was only recently that the first rhenium mineral was found and described (in 1994), a rhenium sulfide mineral (ReS2) condensing from a fumarole on Kudriavy volcano, Iturup island, in the Kuril Islands. Kudriavy discharges up to 20–60 kg rhenium per year mostly in the form of rhenium disulfide. Named rheniite, this rare mineral commands high prices among collectors. 

Most of the rhenium extracted comes from porphyry molybdenum deposits. These ores typically contain 0.001% to 0.2% rhenium. Roasting the ore volatilizes rhenium oxides. Rhenium(VII) oxide and perrhenic acid readily dissolve in water; they are leached from flue dusts and gasses and extracted by precipitating with potassium or ammonium chloride as the perrhenate salts, and purified by recrystallization. Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, the United States, Peru, and Poland. Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons per year. Prices for the metal rose rapidly in early 2008, from $1000–$2000 per kg in 2003–2006 to over $10,000 in February 2008. The metal form is prepared by reducing ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high temperatures:

:2 NH4ReO4 + 7 H2 → 2 Re + 8 H2O + 2 NH3
:There are technologies for the associated extraction of rhenium from productive solutions of underground leaching of uranium ores.

=== Bohrium ===

Bohrium is a synthetic element that does not occur in nature. Very few atoms have been synthesized, and also due to its radioactivity, only limited research has been conducted. Bohrium is only produced in nuclear reactors and has never been isolated in pure form.

== Applications ==
The &quot;facial&quot; isomer of both rhenium and manganese 2,2&#x27;-bipyridyl tricarbonyl halide complexes have been extensively researched as catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction due to their high selectivity and stability. They are commonly abbreviated as M(R-bpy)(CO)3X where M = Mn, Re; R-bpy = 4,4&#x27;-disubstituted 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine; and X = Cl, Br.

=== Manganese ===

The rarity of rhenium has shifted research toward the manganese version of these catalysts as a more sustainable alternative. The first reports of catalytic activity of Mn(R-bpy)(CO)3Br towards CO2 reduction came from Chardon-Noblat and coworkers in 2011. Compared to Re analogs, Mn(R-bpy)(CO)3Br shows catalytic activity at lower overpotentials.

The catalytic mechanism for Mn(R-bpy)(CO)3X is complex and depends on the steric profile of the bipyridine ligand. When R is not bulky, the catalyst dimerizes to form [Mn(R-bpy)(CO)3]2 before forming the active species. When R is bulky, however, the complex forms the active species without dimerizing, reducing the overpotential of CO2 reduction by 200-300 mV. Unlike Re(R-bpy)(CO)3X, Mn(R-bpy)(CO)3X only reduces CO2 in the presence of an acid.

=== Technetium ===

Technetium-99m (&quot;m&quot; indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope medical tests. For example, Technetium-99m is a radioactive tracer that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body. It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140 keV gamma rays, and its half-life is 6.01 hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24 hours). The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds, each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body, and this single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests. More than 50 common radiopharmaceuticals are based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the brain, heart muscle, thyroid, lungs, liver, gall bladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood, and tumors. Technetium-99m is also used in radioimaging.

The longer-lived isotope, technetium-95m with a half-life of 61 days, is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems.

Technetium-99 decays almost entirely by beta decay, emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.

Like rhenium and palladium, technetium can serve as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.

When steel is immersed in water, adding a small concentration (55 ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) to the water protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to . For this reason, pertechnetate has been used as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium&#x27;s radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20 years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.

As noted, the radioactive nature of technetium (3 MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.

=== Rhenium ===

The catalytic activity of Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl for carbon dioxide reduction was first studied by Lehn et al. and Meyer et al. in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Re(R-bpy)(CO)3X complexes exclusively produce CO from CO2 reduction with Faradaic efficiencies of close to 100% even in solutions with high concentrations of water or Brønsted acids.

The catalytic mechanism of Re(R-bpy)(CO)3X involves reduction of the complex twice and loss of the X ligand to generate a five-coordinate active species which binds CO2. These complexes will reduce CO2 both with and without an additional acid present; however, the presence of an acid increases catalytic activity. The high selectivity of these complexes to CO2 reduction over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction has been shown by density functional theory studies to be related to the faster kinetics of CO2 binding compared to H+ binding.

=== Bohrium ===

Bohrium is a synthetic element and is too radioactive to be used in anything.

== Toxicity and precautions ==

Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals, such as nickel and copper. However, exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5 mg/m3 even for short periods because of its toxicity level. Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders.

Technetium has low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15 μg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. In the body, technetium quickly gets converted to the stable ion, which is highly water-soluble and quickly excreted. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) is a function of compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope&#x27;s half-life. However, it is radioactive, so all isotopes must be handled carefully. The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. For most work, careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient, and a glove box is not needed.

Very little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800 mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD50 of 280 mg/kg.

== Biological role ==

Of the group 7 elements, only manganese has a role in the human body. It is an essential trace nutrient, with the body containing approximately 10 milligrams at any given time. It is present as a coenzyme in biological processes that include macronutrient metabolism, bone formation, and free radical defense systems. It is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes. The manganese in the human body is mainly concentrated in the bones, and the soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes. Technetium, rhenium, and bohrium have no known biological roles. Technetium is, however, used in radioimaging.

<text>Lake Quinault ( or ) is a lake on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington state. It is located in the glacial-carved Quinault Valley of the Quinault River, at the southern edge of Olympic National Park in the northwestern United States. One of the most dominant features of Lake Quinault is its location within the Quinault Rainforest, a temperate rain forest.

Lake Quinault is owned by the Quinault Indian Nation. The area is accessible from U.S. Route 101.

Area activities include fishing (with permit from the Quinaults), scenic drives (a loop around the lake is longer than ), and hiking. The southern side of the lake features a system of short hiking trails maintained by the U.S. Forest Service that are accessible to casual day hikers.

The southern side of the lake is home to the historic Lake Quinault Lodge and the Rain Forest Resort Village and is encompassed by the Olympic National Forest. The Quinault Loop Trail on the south side of the lake and the nearby Quinault Rain Forest Interpretive Trail connecting campgrounds, trails, and the lodge, with excellent temperate rainforest viewing. Each trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 1979. The north side of the lake is bordered mainly by private homes and some small resorts located in Olympic National Park.

Lake Quinault receives an average of 333 centimeters (131 inches) of precipitation per year.

<doc id="483865" wikidata="Q7872646" url="?curid=483865" title="USS Panther (1889)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Panther&quot; (AD-6), the former &quot;SS Venezuela&quot;, was an auxiliary cruiser and naval troop transport in the United States Navy. &quot;Panther&quot; was designated AD-6 in 1920.

==Construction, acquisition, and commissioning==
&quot;Panther&quot; was built by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, in 1889. As SS &quot;Venezuela&quot;, a merchant steamship, she was used for several years as a cargo freighter transporting bananas from Central and South America. The U.S. Navy purchased &quot;Panther&quot; from the Red D Line Steamship Company on 12 April 1898, and commissioned her at New York on 22 April 1898, Commander George Cook Reiter in command.

==Service history==

===Spanish–American War, 1898–1899===
&quot;Panther&quot; was pressed into service immediately after commissioning on the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, and was hastily converted into a troop transport. On 27 April 1898 the ship took aboard the First Marine battalion commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Huntington in preparation for combat operations in Cuba, sailing from Brooklyn, New York just five days later. As a converted &#x27;banana boat&#x27;, the &quot;Panther&quot; proved totally inadequate as a troop transport, and the morale of the Marines suffered in the tight and sweaty confines of the hastily converted ship as it steamed southward. As the &quot;Panther&quot; was unarmed, it was forced to stop at Hampton Roads, Virginia to obtained an armed escort before steaming to Key West, Florida, to await orders while the Marines disembarked for battalion drills, rifle practice, and route marches. The ship then joined the North Atlantic Fleet, portions of which blockaded Cuba throughout the conflict. Admiral William T. Sampson received word from Key West early in May that Spanish Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete&#x27;s squadron was very likely to sortie against U.S. naval forces at Santiago, Cuba. &quot;Panther&quot; and other ships of the American fleet patrolled off that port until she steamed to Guantánamo with a battalion of 633 enlisted Marines and 24 officers commanded by Lt. Col. Robert W. Huntington.

On 9–10 June 1898 the &quot;Panther&quot; disembarked the First Marine Battalion at Caimanera, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba in preparation for seizure of the harbor. During the landings, Commander Reiter of the &quot;Panther&quot;, who had continually argued over control of the Marine battalion while it was aboard ship, refused to permit the Marines to unload their small arms and artillery ammunition for their offensive, stating that he needed it for ship&#x27;s ballast. He was overruled by another Navy Commander, Bowman H. McCalla, who instructed Reiter to give the Marine Lieutenant Colonel whatever he desired.

From 11 to 14 June 1898 the Marines engaged Spanish forces in the land battles of the Guantánamo Bay campaign. After a series of sharp engagements, the marines routed the 500 Spanish defenders, while suffering casualties of six killed and 16 wounded. The &quot;Panther&quot; then withdrew to her former position with the fleet in the successful campaign at Santiago. After the destruction of the Spanish fleet, &quot;Panther&quot; steamed to New York, to cruise between New York, Boston, Norfolk, and Portsmouth until 20 October 1899, when she went into ordinary at Philadelphia.

===Caribbean Squadron, 1902–1903===
She remained in ordinary until recommissioning on 19 June 1902, when she fitted out as a training ship. In July, she steamed to New York to begin operations with various state militias. In this connection, she embarked crews from New Jersey in July, Pennsylvania in early August, and Connecticut later that month. In 1902, disturbing conditions in the West Indies and Caribbean required the constant presence of U.S. ships to maintain order and preserve U.S. treaty rights. In September 1902, &quot;Panther&quot; embarked a Marine battalion and departed for Caribbean waters to serve as a station ship to protect American interests during unrest in Honduras. She continued with the Caribbean Squadron until 21 October 1903, when she decommissioned at Philadelphia.

===North Atlantic &amp; Asiatic Station, 1907–1923===
&quot;Panther&quot; recommissioned on 18 November 1907 to serve as an auxiliary repair ship for the United States Atlantic Fleet until April 1917. She served as one of the auxiliary ships supporting the Great White Fleet&#x27;s cruise around the world (16 December 1907 to 22 February 1909). She sailed for Brest on 1 July 1917 to serve as tender for the U.S. destroyer force during World War I.

After the war, her duties took her to ports such as Kirkwall, Scotland; Devonport, England; Lisbon, and Ponta Delgada. In 1921, American interest shifted to China; the Navy&#x27;s Yangtze River Patrol had operated there for some years, guaranteeing the prevention of strife and the protection of persons and interests in the region. &quot;Panther&quot; joined the Asiatic Station&#x27;s Yangtze River Patrol, where she patrolled on station until May 1922, when she returned stateside to decommission. She subsequently was sold to Tioga Steel Co., Philadelphia, 24 March 1923. She was broken up for scrap at Philadelphia in April 1923.

<text>HMAS &quot;Madang&quot; (P 94), named for the settlement of Madang in New Guinea, was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Completed in 1968, the vessel was one of five assigned to the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea (PNG) Division. The patrol boat was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974 as HMPNGS &quot;Madang&quot;. She was decommissioned in 1989.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation), and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, fourteen were ordered for the RAN, five of which were intended for the Papua New Guinea Division of the RAN, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Madang&quot; was built by Evans Deakin at Brisbane, Queensland, launched on 10 August 1968, and commissioned on 28 November 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Madang&quot; arrived in Port Moresby in March 1969, the last of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class boats to be delivered to the PNG Division. Her home port was the RAN base at Los Negros Island, Manus Province. Primary roles of the new patrol boats were fisheries protection and sea training, but also undertook search and rescue, medical evacuation and monitoring of navigational aids roles. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing.

&quot;Madang&quot; was one of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats of the PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force&#x27;s (PNGDF) Maritime Element (now Maritime Operations Element) on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus. &quot;Madang&quot; was decommissioned in 1989.

<text>HMS &quot;Mallow was an [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] built for the [[Royal Navy]], and later operated by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) asHMAS &quot;Mallow.

==Construction==
&quot;Mallow&quot; was constructed by Barclay Curle at Glasgow in Scotland. She was launched on 13 July 1915.

==Operational history==

===World War I===
During World War I, the sloop was tasked primarily with minesweeping. On 31 December 1915, Mallow picked up the bulk of the survivors of the passenger ship (which had been torpedoed the day before off Crete) and conveyed them to Alexandria. In 1918, &quot;Mallow&quot; rescued the passengers of the French mailboat , including future acting Governor-General of Madagascar Joseph Guyon, after the mailboat was torpedoed by a German U-boat. &quot;Mallow&quot; later received letters of commendation from the Admiralty and Guyon.

===With the RAN===
The sloop was transferred to the RAN in 1919.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Mallow&quot; paid off to reserve on 18 October 1919, was decommissioned on 20 November 1925, and sunk as a target on 24 April 1935.

<text>The King County Courthouse is the administrative building housing the judicial branch of King County, Washington&#x27;s government. It is located in downtown Seattle, just north of Pioneer Square. The 1916 structure houses the King County Prosecuting Attorney, the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (KCSO), the King County Council, the King County Law Library, King County Work and Education Release, and courtrooms for the King County Superior Court and the Seattle District Court. It is located just north of City Hall Park at 516 Third Avenue, between Dilling Way and James Street.

An enclosed skybridge connects the courthouse to the King County Jail; it is used to transfer prisoners between the courthouse and the jail. A pedestrian tunnel connects the courthouse to the King County Administration Building.

==History==
In 1911, King County voters first turned down, then approved plans to build a new structure for county government. The site settled on had once been owned by Seattle founder Henry Yesler.
Seattle-based architect A. Warren Gould proposed a twenty-three story tower to handle anticipated growth in county functions, but the county commissioners preferred a more modest beginning so it was constructed in stages. Starting in 1914, a five-story steel frame and reinforced concrete structure was built, and dedicated May 4, 1916 as the City-County Building. In 1930, six floors were added by architects Henry Bittman and John L. McCauley, and later a three-story &quot;attic&quot;.

The city government moved their offices from the County–City Building in 1962; the building was renamed the King County Courthouse in August of that year. Modernization efforts in 1967 added air conditioning and heavily modified the appearance of the building. In 1987, the King County Courthouse was registered as a King County landmark, which limits the style of future remodeling of public areas to restoring the original appearance.

After the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, the courthouse was seismically retrofitted. The extensive damage done to older buildings in the area by the 6.8 quake pushed the county to move forward with this project. Upon completion, murals and a treatment of the marble floor on the first floor of the Courthouse were noted decorative touches.

The area around the courthouse is proximate to major homeless service agencies and had seen a rise in crimes committed against jurors and courthouse workers. In December 2019, the King County Superior Court announced that the courthouse entrance facing 3rd Avenue would be closed for security reasons to most people, with limited access for individuals needing accommodation.

<text>The International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) is a yearly international conference for computer music researchers and composers. It is the annual conference of the International Computer Music Association (ICMA).

==History==
In 1986, the Institute of Sonology institute was moved to the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, hosting the International Computer Music Conference there during its inaugural year.

Each year there is a specific theme. For example, in 2007, the theme was &quot;Immersed Music&quot; and immersive media. ICMC 2007 took place in Copenhagen. On August 28, there was an &quot;Underwater/Water Concert&quot; at the DGI-byen swimcenter, in the hundred-metre DGI-byen pool, as well as the various other pools of the Vandkulturhuset.

This &quot;Immersed Music&quot; theme of ICMC 2007 explored important issues in musical instrument classification and immersion.

2014 40th ICMC is organised joint with the 11th Sound and Music Computing Conference in Athens, Greece 14–20 September 2014.

2017 43rd ICMC took place from Oct 16, 2017 - Oct 20, 2017 in Shanghai, China. 2018 44th ICMC took place from 5–10 August 2018 in Daegu, Korea.

<text>The RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer (nicknamed &quot;Victor&quot;) was the first programmable electronic synthesizer and the flagship piece of equipment at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, the Mark II gave the user more flexibility and had twice the number of tone oscillators as its predecessor, the Mark I. The synthesizer was funded by a large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.

Earlier 20th century electronic instruments such as the Telharmonium or the theremin were manually operated. The RCA combined diverse electronic sound generation with a music sequencer, which proved a huge attraction to composers of the day, who were growing weary of creating electronic works by splicing together individual sounds recorded on sections of magnetic tape. The RCA Mark II featured a binary sequencer using a paper tape reader analogous to a player piano, that would send instructions to the synthesizer, automating playback from the device. The synthesizer would then output sound to a synchronized record lathe next to the machine. The resulting recording would then be compared against the punch-tape score, and the process would be repeated until the desired results were obtained.

The sequencer features of the RCA were of particular attraction to modernist composers of the time, especially those interested in writing dodecaphonic music with a high degree of precision. The RCA is cited by composers of the day as contributing to the rise of musical complexity, because it allowed composers the freedom to write music using rhythms and tempos that were impractical, if not impossible, to realize on acoustic instruments. The allure of precision as a mark of aesthetic progress (continuing with contemporary computer-based sequencers) generated high expectations for the Mark II, and contributed to the increased awareness of electronic music as a viable new art form. An album featuring the instrument and its capabilities was issued by RCA (LM-1922) in 1955.

The synthesizer had a four-note variable polyphony (in addition to twelve fixed-tone oscillators and a white noise source). The synthesizer was difficult to configure, requiring extensive patching of analog circuitry prior to running a score. Little attempt was made to teach composition on the synthesizer, and with few exceptions the only persons proficient in the machine&#x27;s use were the designers at RCA and the engineering staff at Columbia who maintained it. Princeton University composer Milton Babbitt, though not by any means the only person to use the machine, is the composer most often associated with it, and was its biggest advocate.

A number of important pieces in the electronic music repertoire were composed and realized on the RCA. Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Vision and Prayer&quot; and &quot;Philomel&quot; both feature the RCA, as does Charles Wuorinen&#x27;s 1970 Pulitzer Prize for Music-winning piece &quot;Time&#x27;s Encomium&quot;. Over time it fell into disrepair, and it remains only partly functional. The last composer to get any sound out of the synthesizer was R. Luke DuBois, who used it for a fifty-one second piece on the Freight Elevator Quartet&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Album&quot; in 1997.
Although part of the history of electronic music, the RCA was seldom used. Made to United States Air Force construction specifications (and even sporting a USAF oscilloscope), its active electronics were constructed entirely with vacuum tubes, rendering the machine obsolete by its tenth birthday, having been surpassed by more reliable and affordable solid state modular synthesizers such as the Buchla and Moog modular synthesizer systems. It was prohibitively expensive to replicate, and an RCA Mark III, though conceived by Belar and Olsen, was never constructed. Nor was RCA to remain in the synthesizer business, prompting Columbia to purchase enough spare parts to build two duplicate synthesizers.

Much of the historical interest of the RCA, besides its association with the Electronic Music Center, comes from a number of amusing and possibly apocryphal stories told regarding the synthesizer. One common story is that Ussachevsky and Otto Luening effectively conned RCA into building the machine, claiming that a synthesizer built to their specifications would &quot;replace the symphony orchestra,&quot; prompting RCA executives to gamble the cost of the synthesizer in the hopes of being able to eliminate their unionized radio orchestra.

In 1959, the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center acquired the machine from RCA. At Columbia-Princeton, Milton Babbitt used it extensively. His tape and tape and instrument pieces were realized using the RCA Mark II, including his masterpiece &quot;Philomel&quot;, for synthesized sound and soprano.
The RCA remains housed at the Columbia Computer Music Center facility on 125th Street in New York City, where it is bolted to the floor in the office of Professor Brad Garton.

<doc id="483885" wikidata="Q7394401" url="?curid=483885" title="SS St. Louis (1894)">
<text>SS St. Louis was a passenger liner built in 1894 and sponsored by the wife of U.S. President Grover Cleveland. She entered merchant service in 1895, operating between New York and Southampton, England. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was registered in the United States and owned by the International Navigation Company of New York City. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy during both the Spanish–American War (when she was renamed USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;) and World War I (when she was renamed USS &quot;Louisville&quot;). After the ship reverted to its original name in 1919, she caught fire and was scrapped in Genoa in 1924.

==Service history==
===Spanish–American War===
On a later voyage following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was chartered for Naval service while at Southampton and returned to New York on 22 April 1898. Armed with four 5-inch rapid fire guns and eight 6-pounders, she was commissioned as an auxiliary cruiser in the United States Navy on 24 April, Capt. Caspar F. Goodrich in command. &quot;St. Louis&quot;, crewed by 27 officers and 350 men, departed on 30 April for the Caribbean.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; was specially outfitted with heavy drag lines in order to destroy undersea cable communications in the West Indies and to the mainland of South America. On 13 May, the ship severed a cable between St. Thomas and San Juan, and on 18 May engaged in gunfire with the Morro Castle batteries at Santiago de Cuba while cutting another cable. When Admiral Pascual Cervera&#x27;s fleet sailed into Santiago Harbor, the Spanish warships found themselves cut off from direct communications with Spain.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; next severed the cable between Guantanamo Bay and Haiti; then cut the cable off Cienfuegos to isolate Cuba from outside communications. She joined in the bombardment of fortifications at Caimanera in Guantanamo Bay on 3 June; captured a Spanish merchant ship on the 10th; intercepted two British ships bound for Cuba - the &quot;Twickenham&quot; on 10 June and &quot;Wary&quot; on 1 July; and was present at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July when the Spanish Fleet was destroyed while trying to force its way to sea.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; received many prisoners of war, including Admiral Cervera, for internment in the United States and landed them at Portsmouth, N.H., on 11 July. She steamed south from Norfolk on the 28th to cruise among ports of Puerto Rico and Cuba until 10 August; then sailed for New York where she arrived on the 14th. She shifted to Philadelphia on 24 August to enter the Cramp shipyard for preparation for return to her owners. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was decommissioned on 2 September and was turned over to Mr. J. Parker, a representative of the American Lines.

===World War I===
For many years, SS &quot;St. Louis&quot; was prominent as a passenger liner between New York and Liverpool. For example, in June 1906, the newly married Alice Roosevelt Longworth sailed on the ship for her first trip to Europe. On 17 March 1917, she was provided with an armed guard of 26 sailors and equipped with three 6-inch guns to defend against enemy attack on her New York-to-Liverpool service route. On 30 May, while proceeding up the Irish Sea and skirting the coast of England, she responded rapidly to the orders, &quot;Hard Starboard,&quot; at the sighting of a periscope, and succeeded in dodging a torpedo while apparently striking the submarine which fired it. Later dry-dock examination revealed that 18 feet of her keel rubbing strake had been torn away. On 25 July, her gunners exchanged fire with a surfaced U-boat, some three miles away, and sighted many near misses.

On 17 April 1918, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was delivered to the Navy at New York to be wholly manned and operated by the Navy as a troop transport. She was renamed &quot;Louisville&quot; (SP-1644) to avoid confusion with the heavy cruiser &quot;St. Louis&quot;. &quot;Louisville&quot; was commissioned on 24 April.

&quot;Louisville&quot; first put to sea on 12 October bound for Portland and Southampton, England, and returned to New York on 7 January 1919. From then until 19 August of that year, she made six voyages from New York to Liverpool or to Brest, France, to return American soldiers from the Great War. On 20 August, she shifted to Norfolk and was decommissioned there on 9 September 1919. She was returned to her owner on the 11th and resumed her original name, &quot;St. Louis&quot;.

==Destruction==
On 8 January 1920, while St. Louis was being reconditioned as a passenger liner in Hoboken, N.J., a workman&#x27;s blowtorch ignited a fire. The fire raged into the next day, 9 January. When the fire could not be controlled, the ship was scuttled at the dock and allowed to burn. The only thing left after the fire was her steel hull. Damages were estimated at $1 million. She was later refloated and taken over by insurance underwriters. Over the next five years, under ownership of various investors, she lay at docks in different parts of New York Harbor. Finally, she was sold in 1925; and two Dutch tugs towed her to Italy where she was scrapped by an Italian salvage company.

<doc id="483887" wikidata="Q7096135" url="?curid=483887" title="Open Mike with Mike Bullard">
<text>Open Mike with Mike Bullard is a Canadian late-night talk show which was broadcast on The Comedy Network 1997 to 2003 and also aired on the full CTV Television Network beginning in 1998. For a time it overtook &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to become the highest rated late-night show among Canadian viewers. The show aired at 12:30 AM on CTV and was repeated the next day at 10 PM on the Comedy Network. It was considered the first successful Canadian attempt at the genre, following the previous failures of &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot; and &quot;Friday Night! with Ralph Benmergui&quot;.

&quot;Open Mike&quot; was hosted by comedian Mike Bullard and initially taped at a studio at the back of Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s restaurant in Toronto, Ontario before CTV moved the show to Toronto&#x27;s historic Masonic Temple. It featured two or three panel guests and one musical or comedy performance nightly. The show&#x27;s bandleader and musical director was Orin Isaacs. 

Part of Bullard&#x27;s comedic style was interacting with audience members during his opening monologue, often deriving humour from finding ways to poke fun at an audience member&#x27;s expense. It aired live from midnight to 1 am on CTV and would be repeated the next day in prime time on the Comedy Network.

In the summer of 2003, Bullard&#x27;s contract with CTV expired. According to longtime &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; television critic Bill Brioux, Bullard had been told at a lunch with the head of CTV that his show would be cancelled at the end of its sixth season. He was offered and signed a multi-year deal to start a new, similar show on Global called &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot;. Bullard criticised CTV executives, complaining that the network had ultimately only offered him a one-year contract and little financial support or creative control, accusing the network of not supporting the show and of being &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. This resulted in countercharges of &quot;bitterness&quot; against Bullard who was described as having &quot;burned his bridges&quot; with CTV and the Comedy Network. He said one of the key reasons for moving to Global was a commitment to produce more episodes of the show instead of airing re-runs during the summer, as had been CTV&#x27;s practice. 

The new show on Global carried over many of the staff and sketches from &quot;Open Mike&quot; and aired at the same time as his old show had but faltered in the ratings against CTV, which aired &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; in the same time slot. &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; was cancelled in 2004 after a run of 13 weeks.

==Segments==
*&quot;Open Mike Viewer Of The Week&quot; – Sean Tweedley would make fun of one of the viewers in the audience, but they would be given a digital camera as a prize.
*&quot;The Canadian Quiz&quot; – The last guests would be asked three questions about Canada at the end of every show. Officially, the guests were supposed to get all three questions right, but they usually ended up winning the prize regardless. As the segment was sponsored by Canadian Tire, the prize would usually be one of their exclusive products.
*&quot;The Insider&quot; – An entertainment-themed monologue.
*&quot;Who The Hell Do You Think You Are, You Drunken Bastard?&quot; – a game played at a local bar where the name of a celebrity would be taped on the head of each contestant. They would be given three clues from Mike and had to use them to guess who they were.
*&quot;What did you buy at Canadian Tire and why?&quot; – a crew member would visit the Canadian Tire across the street from the studio and ask shoppers when they left what they had bought and why.

==Awards==
The show won two Gemini Awards, Best Talk Information Series in 1999 and Best Music Variety Program Series in 2001. The show also won the 2000 Hugo Award (Gold Medal) for Best Talk Show at the Chicago International Television Festival. Bullard was also voted one of the top 10 Funniest Canadians in a nationwide poll by &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 2002.

<text>Young Einstein is a 1988 Australian comedy film written, produced, directed by and starring Yahoo Serious. It is a fantasized account of the life of Albert Einstein which alters all people, places and circumstances of his life, including relocating the theoretical physicist to Australia, having him splitting the atom with a chisel, and inventing rock and roll and surfing.

Although highly successful in Australia, and winning an award from the Australian Film Institute Awards, it was poorly received by critics in the United States.

At the APRA Music Awards of 1990, the soundtrack won Most Performed Australasian Work for Film.

==Plot==
Albert Einstein, the son of an apple farmer in Tasmania in the early 1900s, is interested in physics rather than the family business. His father shows him his grandfather&#x27;s &quot;laboratory&quot;, a remote shed where he made beer. His father tells him that they have tried for years to introduce bubbles to beer, saying that the person who can will change the world forever.

After heavy drinking, Einstein postulates the theory of mass–energy equivalence (E=MC2) as a formula to split beer atoms to create bubbles in beer. After spending all night preparing, he splits a beer atom (with hammer and chisel), which causes the shed to explode. After Einstein excitedly shows his parents the formula and a glass of beer with bubbles in it, his father encourages him to head to the Australian mainland and patent the formula. On a train to Sydney, he meets Marie Curie, a Polish-French scientist studying at the University of Sydney, and Preston Preston, the pompous manager of the Sydney Patent Office. Marie is fascinated by Einstein, while Preston is annoyed by him.

In Sydney, Einstein lodges in a whorehouse and finds that the patent office will not accept scientific theories. Einstein leaves and meets Marie at the university, only to upset her professor by erasing his work and writing his own theory. Though he is thrown out, Marie becomes more taken with him. Preston attempts to woo Marie with his upper-class lifestyle. During a performance at a social club, she mentions her interest in Einstein&#x27;s theory. Jealous, Preston has his clerk call Einstein in to take his formula for safe keeping. Preston turns the formula over to the Bavarian Brothers, a pair of brewmasters who intend to use the formula to get rich.

As Einstein invents rock and roll and the electric violin, he begins a romance with Marie. While at a beach, he demonstrates surfing for her. As they leave, Marie wishes the moment could last forever. Inspired, Einstein comes up with the theory of relativity on the spot, amazing Marie. As they return to the hotel, the clerk tells him that Preston is creating a keg using his formula. When Einstein protests, the Bavarian Brothers claim that Einstein is insane and have him committed. Einstein&#x27;s electric violin is destroyed, and he is kept isolated. Marie confronts Preston, who says Einstein would have done nothing with his work and he is trying to help people.

Marie infiltrates the institution as Einstein&#x27;s father confronts Einstein in the shower room, and reveals Preston&#x27;s plot. When Einstein expresses helplessness, Marie leaves disappointed. Einstein rebuilds his violin into an electric guitar, uses it to short out the security system, and escapes. Upon finding she has returned to France, Einstein sails a small steamboat to France and wins her back by promising to stop Preston. They use the Curie family hot air balloon and head to the Nobel ceremony in Paris that night, attended by many inventors and scientific luminaries.

Charles Darwin announces Preston is the winner of this year&#x27;s Nobel Prize for his beer bubble discovery. Einstein interrupts Preston&#x27;s speech and questions if Preston knows what happens when an atom is split. When Darwin realizes that Preston has unknowingly built an atomic bomb, he orders Preston to stop. Preston scoffs at the warning and starts the keg, which starts shaking and building up pressure. Einstein attaches his guitar to the keg to drain it despite Marie&#x27;s warning that this will kill him. Einstein plays a guitar riff, which causes the keg to lose power. Preston attempts to kill Einstein, but Marie knocks him unconscious. Einstein radiates pure energy, which causes a massive feedback, then an explosion.

As the smoke clears, Einstein is revealed to be unharmed. He and Marie kiss as the assembled crowd cheers while Preston had been escorted out and committed. He returns to Tasmania with the keg and the Nobel Prize. He tells his family that he will give his formula to the world instead of keeping it for personal gain. Marie questions what will happen if governments use that formula to create atomic weapons. Einstein naively expresses his trust in the governments of the world, announces he has learned a new theory, and then plays a rock and roll song.

==Production==
Serious first became interested in Albert Einstein when he was travelling down the Amazon River and saw a local wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a physicist on it. The image was that of Einstein sticking out his tongue, taken by photographer Arthur Sasse.

On returning from the Amazon, Serious adapted a previous screenplay called &quot;The Great Galute&quot; which he had written with David Roach. It was a story about an Australian who invents rock and roll. The two developed &quot;The Great Galute&quot; into &quot;Young Einstein&quot;.

The film was created on an extremely low budget, so low that Serious sold his car to generate funds, cameras were borrowed, and his mother cooked for the crew.

Serious managed to get Australian Film Commission support for the movie. By March 1984, an hour of the film had been shot, partly by the AFC and partly by private investment. Serious was then able to pre-sell the film to an American company, Film Accord, for $2 million. This enabled him to raise the film&#x27;s original budget of $2.2 million. The movie started filming again late in 1985 and went for seven weeks, from 23 September, taking place in Newcastle and Wollombi, near Cessnock in the Hunter Valley, with the second unit at various locations throughout Australia. A 91-minute version of the film was entered in the 1986 AFI Awards where composer William Motzing won Best Music.

In 1986, Film Accord sued the production to recover its distribution guarantee and the rushes, claiming the film delivered was not the one it had contracted to buy. The dispute was settled out of court.

Serious was unhappy with his first version of the film. Graham Burke from Roadshow saw it and became enthusiastic about its possibilities. Roadshow bought out Film Accord in March 1987, persuaded Warner Bros. to take on the film for international distribution outside Australia, and financed re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring, resulting in an hour of new material which included a new ending and new music score which included the addition of songs by artists such as Paul Kelly, Icehouse and Mental As Anything. This pushed the budget of the film up to $5 million. Warner Bros. contributed to the full version of the film, and would go on to spend $8 million on marketing the film in the United States alone.

Serious&#x27; key collaborators in the movie were co-writer David Roach, co-producer Warwick Rodd and associate producer Lulu Pinkus. He has said it helped that they all shared the same vision for the movie which got them through the long production process.

Serious refused to consider making a sequel to the film, as he stated in interviews that he was opposed to them in general.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received negative reviews in the United States, with &quot;Spin&quot; describing the release as a &quot;marketing misfire&quot; due to Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;PR department&#x27;s penchant for overkill&quot;. Roger Ebert called it a &quot;one-joke movie, and I didn&#x27;t laugh much the first time.&quot; He theorized that the lack of appeal to American audiences was because of the film&#x27;s &quot;comic situations that appeal to the vast and inexhaustible fascination the Australians have about their own isolation and gawky charm. But the jokes don&#x27;t travel very well.&quot; He gave the film one star out of a possible four. Ebert&#x27;s colleague Gene Siskel said he &quot;didn&#x27;t laugh once&quot; during the film and named it one of the worst pictures of 1989. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was also unimpressed: Rita Kempley called the film &quot;dumber-than-a-bowling-ball&quot; and questioned its mass appeal; Desson Howe noted that distributor Warner Bros. had made it a &quot;pre-processed legend&quot; regardless of merit. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more tempered, noting that though the film was &quot;an uneven series of sketches strung along an extended joke&quot;, that the first time director Serious &quot;is a much more adept film maker than his loony plot suggests.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave a favorable review, saying the film would appeal to younger audiences and that &quot;it&#x27;s just about impossible to dislike a movie in which examples of the hero&#x27;s pacifism include his risking his life to save kitties from being baked to death inside a pie.&quot; Neil Jillett of Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; reviewed the film positively, noting that despite some &quot;directorial slackness&quot;, the film was &quot;a lively work that is sophisticated and innocent, witty and farcical, satirical and unmalicious, intelligent but not condescending, full of concern with big issues but not arrogantly didactic, thoroughly Australian but not nationalistic.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; meanwhile thought that the film relied on the performance of Yahoo Serious, who they described &quot;exhibits a brash and confident sense of humor, endearing personality, and a fondness for sight gags.&quot; Although giving it a low rating, Leonard Maltin stated, &quot;any movie with &#x27;cat pies&#x27; can&#x27;t be all bad&quot;.

In the UK, William Russell for the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; described the film as &quot;trying too hard to be funny for its own good.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 36% rating based on reviews from 33 critics. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Young Einstein&quot; suggests Yahoo Serious could be an effective leading man in the right comedic setting -- but this disappointingly uneven outing isn&#x27;t it.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Young Einstein&quot; grossed A$13,383,377 at the box office in Australia. On release in Australia, it became the fifth biggest opening in Australian film history behind &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot;, &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee II&quot;, &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, and &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. It grossed A$1.26 million in the opening weekend, despite being released in only three states. It was only the third film of 1988 to exceed the A$1 million mark at the Australian box office. &quot;Young Einstein&quot; became the tenth most successful film released at the Australian box office, after being the second most successful Australian film ever on release after &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot;.

In the United States, it debuted at No. 8 on opening weekend. US distributor Warner Bros., hoping for similar crossover success as &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot;, spent US$8 million on a major marketing push. It continues to be regarded as a flop. It did, however, end its US theatrical run at a slightly profitable $11,536,599.

The film has been released on DVD in region 1. The DVD is available in Australia by LA Entertainment.

<doc id="483897" wikidata="Q152919" url="?curid=483897" title="Li Si">
<text>Li Si (; 208 BC) was a Chinese calligrapher, philosopher, and politician of the Qin dynasty. He served as Chancellor from 246 to 208 BC, first under King Zheng of the state of Qin—who later became Qin Shi Huang, the &quot;First Emperor&quot; of the Qin dynasty. He then served under Qin Er Shi, Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s eighteenth son and the second emperor. Concerning administrative methods, Li Si is said to have admired and utilized the ideas of Shen Buhai, repeatedly referring to the technique of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, but regarding law, he followed Shang Yang.

John Knoblock, a translator of classical Chinese texts, considered Li Si to be &quot;one of the two or three most important figures in Chinese history&quot; as a result of his efforts in standardizing the Qin state and its conquered territories. Li Si assisted the Emperor in unifying laws, governmental ordinances, and weights and measures. He also standardized chariots, carts, and characters used in writing, facilitating the cultural unification of China. He &quot;created a government based solely on merit, so that in the empire sons and younger brothers in the imperial clan were not ennobled, but meritorious ministers were&quot;, and &quot;pacified the frontier regions by subduing the barbarians to the north and south&quot;. He had the metal weapons of the feudal states melted and cast into bells and statues. He also lowered taxes and eased draconian punishments for criminals that had originated from statesman Shang Yang.

== Early life ==
Li Si was originally from Cai in the state of Chu. As a young man he was a minor functionary in the local administration of Chu. According to the &quot;Records of the Great Historian&quot;, one day Li Si observed that rats in the outhouse were dirty and hungry, but rats in the barn were well-fed. He suddenly realized that &quot;there is no set standard for honour since everyone&#x27;s life is different. The values of people are determined by their social status. And like rats, people&#x27;s social status often depends purely on the random life events around them. And so instead of always being restricted by moral codes, people should do what they deemed best at the moment.&quot; He made up his mind to take up politics as a career, which was a common choice for scholars not from a noble family during the Warring States period.

Li Si was unable to advance his career in Chu. He believed that achieving nothing in life while being so intelligent and educated would bring shame to not just himself but to all scholars. After having finished his education with the famous Confucian thinker Xunzi, he moved to the state of Qin, the most powerful state at that time, in an attempt to advance his political career.

== Career in Qin ==
During his stay in Qin, Li Si became a guest of Lü Buwei, who was Chancellor, and had the chance to talk to King Ying Zheng, who would later become the first emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang. Li Si expressed that the Qin state was extremely powerful, but unifying China was still impossible if all of the other six states at the time united to fight against Qin. Qin Shi Huang was impressed by Li Si&#x27;s view of how to unify China. Having adopted Li Si&#x27;s proposal, the ruler of Qin spent generously to lure intellectuals to the state of Qin and sent out assassins to kill important scholars in other states.

In 237 BC, a clique at the Qin court urged King Zheng to expel all foreigners from the state to prevent espionage. As a native of Chu, Li Si would be a target of the policy, so he memorialised the king explaining the many benefits of foreigners to Qin including &quot;the sultry girls of Zhao.&quot; The king relented and, impressed with Li Si&#x27;s rhetoric, promoted him. The same year, Li Si is reported to have urged King Zheng to annex the neighbouring state of Han to order to intimidate the other five remaining states. Li Si also wrote the &quot;Jianzhuke Shu&quot; (&quot;Petition against the Expulsion of Guest Officers&quot;) in 234 BC. Han Fei, a member of the aristocracy from the State of Han, was asked by the Han king to go to Qin and resolve the situation through diplomacy. Li Si, who envied Han Fei&#x27;s intellect, persuaded the Qin king that he could neither send Han Fei back (as his superior ability would be a threat to Qin) nor employ him (as his loyalty would not be to Qin). As a result, Han Fei was imprisoned, and in 233 BC convinced by Li Si to commit suicide by taking poison. The state of Han was later conquered in 230 BC.

After Qin Shi Huang became emperor, Li Si persuaded him to suppress intellectual dissent. Li Si believed that books regarding things such as medicine, agriculture, and prophecy could be ignored, but political books were dangerous in public hands. He believed that it was hard to make progress and change the country with the opposition of so many &quot;free thinking&quot; scholars. As a result, only the state should keep political books, and only state-run schools should be allowed to educate political scholars. Li Si himself penned the edict ordering the destruction of historical records and literature in 213 BC, including key Confucian texts, which he thought detrimental to the welfare of the state. It is commonly thought that 460 Confucian scholars were buried alive in the well-known &quot;burning of books and burying of scholars&quot;.

== Death ==
When Qin Shi Huang died while away from the capital, Li Si and the chief eunuch Zhao Gao suppressed the late emperor&#x27;s choice of successor, which was Fusu. At that time, as Fusu was close friends with Meng Tian, there was a high chance that Li Si would be replaced by Meng Tian as chancellor should Fusu become emperor. Fearing a loss of power, Li Si decided to betray the dead Qin Shi Huang. Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked Fusu into committing suicide and installed another prince, Qin Er Shi (229–207 BC), in his place. During the tumultuous aftermath, Zhao Gao convinced the new emperor to install his followers in official positions. When his power base was secure enough, Zhao Gao betrayed Li Si and charged him with treason. Qin Er Shi, who viewed Zhao Gao as his teacher, did not question his decision. Zhao Gao had Li Si tortured until he admitted to the crime and once even intercepted a letter of pleas Li Si had sent to the Emperor. In 208 BC, Zhao Gao had Li Si subjected to the Five Punishments, executed via waist chop at a public market, and his entire family to the third degree exterminated. Sima Qian records Li Si&#x27;s last words to his son as having been, &quot;I wish that you and I could take our brown dog and go out through the eastern gate of Shang Cai to chase the crafty hare. But how could we do that!&quot;

== Legacy ==
Believing in a highly bureaucratic system, Li Si was central to the efficiency of Qin and the success of its military conquest. He was also instrumental in systematizing standard measures and currency in post-unified China. He further helped systematize the written Chinese language by promulgating as the imperial standard the small seal script which had already been in use in Qin. In this process, variant glyphs within the Qin script were proscribed, as were variant scripts from the different regions which had been conquered. This had a unifying effect on the Chinese culture for thousands of years. Li Si was also the author of the &quot;Cangjiepian&quot;, the first Chinese language primer of which fragments still exist.

<doc id="483902" wikidata="Q1195660" url="?curid=483902" title="Small seal script">
<text>The small seal script is an archaic script style of written Chinese. It developed within the state of Qin during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (771–256 BC), and was then promulgated across China in order to replace script varieties used in other ancient Chinese states following Qin&#x27;s wars of unification and establishment of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) under Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China.

== History ==
During the Eastern Zhou dynasty (256 BC), local varieties of Chinese character forms had developed across the country, producing the &#x27;scripts of the six states&#x27; ()—which were later collectively referred to as large seal script. This variance was considered unacceptable by the nascent Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), who saw it as a hindrance to timely communication, trade, taxation, and transportation, as well as being a potential vector for fomenting political dissent. Around 220 BC, Qin Shi Huang ordered a systematic standardization of the country&#x27;s weights, measures, and currency, as well as its writing system. Character forms which differed from those used by Qin scribes were discarded, with the Qin forms becoming standard across the entire empire.

== Standardization ==
The standardized use of small seal characters was promulgated via the &quot;Cangjiepian&quot; primer compiled by Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s ministers—namely his chancellor Li Si. This compilation, which was claimed to include 3,300 characters, is no longer extant, and is known only through Chinese commentaries over the centuries. Several hundred characters from fragmented commentaries were collected during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), and recent archeological excavations in Anhui have uncovered several hundred more on bamboo strips, showing the order of the characters. However, the script found was not the small seal script, as the discovery dates back to the Han period.

== Encoding ==
The small seal script was initially proposed for inclusion in Unicode in 2015. The 723-page proposal lists many of the best-known examples of Qing-era commentary images. , the proposal remains under discussion.

<doc id="483913" wikidata="Q7751397" url="?curid=483913" title="The Mike Bullard Show">
<text>The Mike Bullard Show is a Canadian late-night talk show which aired weeknights at 12:05 AM on Global from November 24, 2003, to March 11, 2004. The show was hosted by comedian Mike Bullard and taped at the Global Television Theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The show&#x27;s executive producers were David Asper, and, from December onward, Dave Rosen.

The short lived show maintained almost exactly the same format as Bullard&#x27;s previous successful show, &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot;, which had ended its six-year run only five months earlier. Despite this, &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; was a ratings disaster. On average, the programme lost more than 50% of the audience that &quot;Open Mike&quot; had averaged in its final season, and was cancelled after 12 weeks.

==History==

===Signing===
Mike Bullard&#x27;s contract with CTV expired shortly after completing his sixth season of &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot;, at which time he began talks with Global to move his show to their network.

In August 2003, he signed a multi-year deal with Global to host a new show on their network that would be similar to &quot;Open Mike&quot;. The new deal would see 195 episodes produced per year, compared to 140 per year at CTV. The move was widely publicized, with all CanWest-owned newspapers placing the news on the front page. Commercials aired on Global in the late summer/early fall encouraging viewers to watch for Bullard&#x27;s show later in 2003.

In the meantime, CTV added American news satire import &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; to its lineup to replace &quot;Open Mike&quot;, scheduling it to begin airing at 11:59 pm. 6 minutes before Bullard&#x27;s start time, and launched it three weeks before Bullard&#x27;s show premiered on Global.

===November 2003===
&quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; debuted on November 24, 2003, five months after Bullard left CTV. The new show was taped at the newly renovated Global Television Theatre on The Esplanade in Toronto, Ontario. The set was different as well, notably the colour scheme (red, black) in comparison to that of the &quot;Open Mike&quot; set and the three large plasma television screens. However, aside from the change of network, theatre, set and name, &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; was nearly identical to the format of the previous season of &quot;Open Mike&quot;.

From its debut, the ratings for &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; were very low. The show attracted 96,000 viewers on its first night, but that number declined to 54,000 on its second night, compared to Jon Stewart&#x27;s average audience that week of 214,000.

===December 2003===
The ratings situation hadn&#x27;t improved, and executive producer David Asper said that he was stumped as to why the ratings were so low but assumed that it was because the new show hadn&#x27;t yet found its legs. In an attempt to increase ratings for January, Global hired a new executive producer, Dave Rosen, to join Asper and retool the show over the holidays.

===January 2004===
On January 12, 2004, the first &quot;Mike Bullard Show&quot; episode of the new year aired, and it was also the first episode with Rosen as an executive producer. The retooled show&#x27;s ratings improved slightly, but still managed to be two or three times smaller than those of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Global continued to promote the show by airing commercials more frequently.

===February 2004===
&quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; broadcast from Toronto for a week. The appearance of the NBC series generated a tremendous amount of publicity, and some in the media took the opportunity to draw a comparison between &quot;Late Night&quot; and its Canadian competition, Mike Bullard. O&#x27;Brien told a press conference that &quot;the other night I was here in my hotel and I was looking for porn, couldn&#x27;t find any and I tuned in Bullard. He&#x27;s got a funny show. I like that man. Give that man a chance, I say.&quot; To counter &quot;Late Night&quot;, Bullard had popular hockey commentator Don Cherry as his guest.

===March 2004===
&quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; averaged 85,000 viewers for the week of March 1–7, a small improvement over previous weeks but still a far cry from Bullard&#x27;s late-night rival, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, which, with an average of 264,000 viewers for that same week, more than triple Bullard&#x27;s viewership.

Immediately after the March 11, 2004 show, Bullard was told that the show had been cancelled. The crew of more than 35 people who worked on the show were told of the show&#x27;s cancellation the next morning.

===Cancellation===
After only 60 episodes aired over 12 weeks, Doug Hoover, Global&#x27;s senior vice-president of programming, announced in a press release on March 12, 2004, that the network had cancelled the show due to poor ratings. The show&#x27;s overall weekly average throughout its run was only 71,600 viewers, a very disappointing number, especially considering the fact that Bullard averaged 129,000 viewers back when he hosted &quot;Open Mike&quot; and that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on CTV had consistently beaten Bullard in the ratings since the show&#x27;s debut.

Bullard wanted to do a final episode to end the show, but was not given the opportunity.

The cancellation came as no surprise, especially considering the lacklustre ratings and the production costs, which were much higher than those of &quot;Open Mike&quot;.

==Differences from &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot;==
* &quot;The Open Mike Band&quot; (led by Orin Isaacs) became known as &quot;The Bullard Show Band&quot;.
* The segment formerly known on &quot;Open Mike&quot; as &quot;Who The Hell Do You Think You Are, You Drunken Bastard?&quot; was retitled &quot;Who The Hell Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

Although the differences were so minor that some considered &quot;Open Mike&quot; and &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; to be the same, Global considered &quot;The Mike Bullard Show&quot; to be different from &quot;Open Mike&quot; and frowned upon Bullard mentioning &quot;the old show&quot;.

<text>The prime minister of Armenia () is the head of government and most senior minister within the Armenian government, and is required by the constitution to &quot;determine the main directions of policy of the Government, manage the activities of the Government and coordinate the work of the members of the Government.&quot; Also, according to the constitution, the prime minister heads the Security Council, which prescribes the main directions of the country&#x27;s defense policy; thus, the prime minister is effectively the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Nikol Pashinyan is the current prime minister. He took the office on 8 May 2018 following the resignation of Serzh Sargsyan.

== History ==

=== Original role ===
The office of prime minister was first established in 1918 with the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia. The prime minister chosen by the National Council of Armenia and was accountable for international, domestic and regional issues. The first Prime Minister became Hovhannes Katchaznouni whose cabinet was made up from five members, all of which were from ARF. In addition, a ministry of interior was created, whose first head was Aram Manukian. It vanished when the First Republic of Armenia was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and then transferred into a full Soviet republic. 

=== Soviet era ===
The governmental structure of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was similar to that of the other Soviet republics. The highest executive and administrative organ of state power was the Council of Ministers. The Council consisted of the following positions:

* Chairman
* Vice Chairman
* Chairman of the State Planning Commission
* Cabinet Ministers
* Representative of the Committee of Agricultural Stocks
* Chairman of the Board of Arts
* Representative of the All-Union People&#x27;s Commissariat

=== Restoration ===
When Armenia regained its independence in 1991, the office of prime minister was reintroduced. Under the new 2015 constitution, the prime minister is the most powerful and influential person in Armenian politics. The prime minister is appointed by the president of Armenia upon the vote of the National Assembly. The prime minister can be removed by a vote of no confidence in Parliament. In the constitutional referendum held in 2015, citizens voted in favor of transferring Armenia into a parliamentary republic.

== Prime Minister&#x27;s Office ==
The Prime Minister&#x27;s Staff has the task of ensuring the enforcement of the powers vested in the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Ministers, as well as making preparations for Cabinet meetings:

<doc id="483921" wikidata="Q559731" url="?curid=483921" title="Xu Shen">
<text>Xu Shen () was a Chinese calligrapher, philologist, politician, and writer of the Eastern Han dynasty (25–189 CE). During his own lifetime, Xu was recognized as a preeminent scholar of the Five Classics. He was the author of &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, which was the first comprehensive dictionary of Chinese characters, as well as the first to organize entries by radical. This work continues to provide scholars with information on the development and historical usage of Chinese characters. Xu Shen completed his first draft in 100 CE but, waited until 121 CE before having his son present the work to the Emperor An of Han.

== Life ==
Xu was born about 58 CE in the Zhaoling district of Run&#x27;an prefecture (modern Luohe in Henan). He was a student of the scholar-official Jia Kui (30–101 CE). Under Jia, he established himself as a master in his own right and enjoyed a positive reputation. This education allowed him to hold several government offices at the prefecture level, and ultimately rise to a post in the royal library. Before undertaking the &quot;Shuowen&quot;, he was already a prolific writer. Although lost, one of his better known early works was a commentary on the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, an important sociopolitical work from the second century BCE.

Xu Shen&#x27;s life and work were shaped by the fierce division between Old Text and New Text schools of Confucian thought. These rival camps grew out of the wide proliferation of Confucian texts, which was brought on by the Emperor Wu of Han&#x27;s elevation Confucianism to the state philosophy. Because knowledge of the Confucian canon was the primary qualification for government office, there was a large upswing in the rate of copying. These new additions were written in a standardized Han dynasty script. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (), however, older manuscripts were discovered in the imperial archives and in the walls of Confucius&#x27;s family mansion. These older texts were written in a pre-Qin, small seal script (&quot;xiaozhuan&quot; ). Importantly, they also differed in their content and organization. A group of scholars, which came to be called the Old Text school, emerged and advocated for the use of this more ancient version. The New Text school meanwhile preferred the more recent versions. Since Han jurisprudence was based on the classics, the interpretation of even a single character could lead to concrete differences in legal opinions. The great variation in interpretations greatly troubled Xu. He was familiar with both schools: Jia Kui was a respected Old Text scholar, but Xu&#x27;s official work required familiarity with the New Text editions. In an attempt to eliminate discrepancies between interpretations, Xu authored &quot;Different Meanings of the Five Classics&quot; (), a commentary, now lost, that incorporated interpretations from both the New and Old Text schools. Xu picked the readings that were best to his mind, regardless of school. Ultimately though, Xu decided that only a rigorous work on the development and history of each character could standardize the interpretation of the classics.

== The &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; ==
Xu Shen&#x27;s desire to create an exhaustive reference work resulted in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; (). The &quot;Shuowen&quot; has no standard English translation, and is sometimes rendered: &quot;Explain the Graphs and Unravel the Written Words&quot; or &quot;Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters.&quot; The uniting principle behind each part of the massive project was, as Xu Shen writes in his postface, &quot;to establish defined categories, [to] correct mistaken concepts, for the benefit of scholars and true interpretation of the spirit of language.&quot; Intended to be a comprehensive work, it encompasses 15 chapters and over 9,000 small seal script entries, and has a preface and a postface. Xu intentionally listed headwords in pre-Qin characters in order to provide their earliest possible forms, and thereby allow the most faithful interpretation. It is among the first character dictionaries which examined the evolution of characters in detail, and streamlined the &quot;six category&quot; approach to analyzing Chinese writing. It also created a system of 540 semantically organized radicals.

=== Linguistic theory ===
In the postface, Xu gives a brief account of the history of writing. According to legend, Chinese characters were first invented by Cangjie, who was inspired by footprints to create a system of signs that refer to the natural world. These original graphs could then be combined to make meaningful characters with referents distinct from their component graphs. This was important for Xu Shen, who emphasized the productivity, even fertility, of Chinese writing. Despite the novel meanings of compound characters, Xu Shen believed that true understanding of composite characters was contingent on an understanding of their components. Providing clear explanation of these relationships lay at the heart of his motivation.
Central to Xu Shen&#x27;s thought is the contrast between &quot;wen&quot; (文 patterns) and &quot;zi&quot; (字 characters), indeed these contrasting categories of graphs receive separate mention in the work&#x27;s title. Even today, there is disagreement over the exact definitions of the two terms. The Song dynasty scholar Zheng Qiao () first presented the interpretation that &quot;wen&quot; and &quot;zi&quot; are the difference between non-compound and compound characters. More recently, other scholars, such as Françoise Bottéro (2002), have argued that the addition of a specifically phonetic element (and thus not simply compounding) marks the principal difference between &quot;wen&quot; and &quot;zi&quot;. From this original binary contrast, Xu Shen formally delineated for the first time the six categories () of Chinese characters.
* Indicators of Function (), whose forms are iconic without being based on concrete objects. Examples include 上 (&quot;shàng&quot;) and 下 (xià), indicating up and down respectively.
* Form Imaging or Pictographs (), such as 山 (&quot;shān&quot;), meaning mountain.
* Form and Sound (), which consist of a semantic element and an element indicating pronunciation. The character 汗 (&quot;hàn&quot; sweat), for example. contains the phonetic marker 干 (&quot;gān&quot; shield), and the semantic marker 氵(&quot;shuĭ&quot; water).
* Combining Meaning (), which unite two semantic elements. 明, for example contains the sun and the moon, and carries the meaning &#x27;bright&#x27;.
* Reciprocally Glossing (), which arose from a divergence of one character into two separate characters still linked in sound and meaning, such as 老 (&quot;lăo&quot;) and 考 (&quot;kǎo&quot;).
* Loaning Characters (), which essentially indicates one character whose meaning has been broadened to contain multiple definitions. This is seen in bifurcated meanings and pronunciations of , which originally meant &#x27;leader&#x27; (&quot;zhăng&quot;), but came to have the second meaning &#x27;long&#x27; (&quot;cháng&quot;). 
To organize the thousands of headwords, Xu Shen established 540 radicals, and ordered them from least to greatest complexity. Each radical then headed its own group, which in turn subsumed all composite characters which incorporated the specific radical. The total number of 540 has a cosmological weight, as it can be derived from the product of 6, 9, and 10. 6 and 9 are the numbers of Yin and Yang, and 10 a number signifying completion. This number symbolizes the exhaustive scope of the dictionary.

Within the dictionary itself, each entry first gives the character&#x27;s meaning, and alternate orthographies. It also accounts for a character&#x27;s meaning, occasionally pronunciation, and cites examples of its use in the classical texts.

== Models and influences ==
Xu Shen had to rely on a large body of sources to collect the thousands of characters and variants that appear in the &quot;Shuowen&quot;. Many small script characters were taken from the &quot;Cangjiepian&quot; (c. 220 BCE); ancient characters were collected from the texts found in Confucius&#x27;s mansion, and Zhou characters were taken from the &quot;Historian Zhou&#x27;s Primer&quot; (c. 578 BCE, the reign of King Xuan).

The &quot;Shuowen&quot; has often been the subject of commentary and study. The earliest reported research was conducted in the Sui dynasty by Yu Yanmo (), though this work has not survived. Later in the Tang dynasty (618–907), Li Yangbing (713–741) prepared an edition, though this version is lost as well. The oldest surviving editions go back to a pair of brothers, Xu Xuan () and Xu Kai (). The pair lived in the Sui dynasty (581–618), and their work ensured the long-term survival of the &quot;Shuowen&quot;. The well-known philologist Duan Yucai (段玉裁 1735–1815) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) dedicated his life to studying the &quot;Shuowen&quot;, and produced the authoritative version and commentary still used today, the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi Zhu&quot; 說文解字註 (&quot;the Annotated Shuowen Jiezi&quot;).

Xu Shen&#x27;s work also provides a valuable resource for linguistic research. Duan Yucai based much of his research on the &quot;Shuowen&quot;, and the philologist Zhu Junsheng&#x27;s () phonological study &quot;Explanatory Book of Sounds&quot; 說文訓定生 was written as a companion to the &quot;Shuowen&quot;.

Given the number of dictionaries and philological works that draw heavily from the &quot;Shuowen&quot;, Xu Shen has towered over the field of Chinese lexicography, and his influence is still felt today.

== Criticism ==
A number of Xu Shen&#x27;s character analyses are erroneous, as the seal script differs considerably from the older bronzeware script and the even older oracle bone script, both of which were unknown at the time, also to Xu Shen. Karlgren, for example, disputes Xu Shen&#x27;s interpretation of 巠 (jing) as depicting a subterranean water channel. Referring to the bronze script, he proposes a reading linked to weaving. Furthermore, Xu Shen does not account for historical phonological change between the earliest days of Chinese writing and his own era. This results in inaccurate sound analyses.

<text>Unit generators (or &quot;ugens&quot;) are the basic formal units in many MUSIC-N-style computer music programming languages. They are sometimes called opcodes (particularly in Csound), though this expression is not considered accurate in that these are not written directly as machine-level instructions. 

Unit generators form the building blocks for designing synthesis and signal processing algorithms in software.
The unit generator theory of sound synthesis was first developed and implemented by Max Mathews and his colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1950s.

== Examples ==
A simple unit generator called OSC could generate a sinusoidal waveform of a specific frequency (given as an input or argument to the function or class that represents the unit generator). ENV could be a unit generator that delineates a breakpoint function. Thus ENV could be used to drive the amplitude envelope of the oscillator OSC through the equation OSC*ENV. Unit generators often use predefined arrays of values for their functions (which are filled with waveforms or other shapes by calling a specific generator function).

In the SuperCollider language, the .ar method in the SinOsc class inherits methods from an overarching unit generator class (UGen) that generates a sine wave. The example below makes a sine wave at frequency 440, phase 0, and amplitude 0.5.

<text>Audio analysis refers to the extraction of information and meaning from audio signals for analysis, classification, storage, retrieval, synthesis, etc. The observation mediums and interpretation methods vary, as audio analysis can refer to the human ear and how people interpret the audible sound source, or it could refer to using technology such as an audio analyzer to evaluate other qualities of a sound source such as amplitude, distortion, frequency response. Once an audio source&#x27;s information has been observed, the information revealed can then be processed for the logical, emotional, descriptive, or otherwise relevant interpretation by the user. 

== Natural Analysis ==
The most prevalent form of audio analysis is derived from the sense of hearing. A type of sensory perception that occurs in much of the planet&#x27;s fauna, audio analysis is a fundamental process of many living beings. Sounds made by the surrounding environment or other living beings provides input to the hearing mechanism, for which the listener&#x27;s brain can interpret the sound and how it should respond. Examples of functions include speech, startle response, music listening, and more.

An inherent ability of humans, hearing is fundamental in communication across the globe, and the process of assigning meaning and value to speech is a complex but necessary function of the human body. The study of the auditory system has been greatly centered using mathematics and the analysis of sinusoidal vibrations and sounds. The Fourier transform has been an essential theorem in understanding how the human ear processes moving air and turns it into the audible frequency range, about 20 to 20,000 Hz. The ear is able to take one complex waveform and process it into varying frequency ranges thanks to differences in the structures of the ear canal that are tuned to specific frequency ranges. The initial sensory input is then analyzed further up in the neurological system where the perception of sound takes place.

The auditory system also works in tandem with the neural system so that the listener is capable of spatially locating the direction from which a sound source originated. This is known as the Haas or Precedence effect and is possible due to the nature of having two ears, or auditory receptors. The difference in time it takes for a sound to reach both ears provides the necessary information for the brain to calculate the spatial positioning of the source.

== Signal Analysis ==
Audio signals can be analyzed in several different ways, depending on the kind of information desired from the signal.

Types of signal analysis include:

*Level and gain
*Frequency domain analysis
*Frequency response
*Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N)
*Phase
*Crosstalk
*Intermodulation distortion (IMD)
*Stereo and Surround
Hardware analyzers have been the primary means of signal analysis since the invention of the first audio analyzer, made by Hewlett-Packard, the HP200A. Hardware analyzers are typically used in engineering, testing, and manufacturing of professional and consumer grade products. As computer technology progressed, integrated software found its way into these hardware systems, and later there would be audio analysis tools that did not require any hardware components save for the computer running the software. Software audio analyzers are regularly used in various stages of music production, such as live audio, mixing, and mastering. These products tend to employ Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms and processing to provide a visual representation of the signal being analyzed. Display and information types include frequency spectrum, stereo field, surround field, spectrogram, and more.

<text>Duan Yucai () (1735–1815), courtesy name Ruoying () was a Chinese philologist of the Qing Dynasty. He made great contributions to the study of Historical Chinese phonology, and is known for his annotated edition of &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;.

==Biography==
A native of Jintan, Jiangsu, he resigned his government post at the age of 46 to concentrate on his studies. A student of Dai Zhen, he divided Old Chinese words into 17 rhyme groups. He suggested that &quot;characters sharing the same phonetic component must belong to the same rhyme group [as deduced from the rhyming scheme of &quot;Shijing&quot;]&quot; (). He also suggested that there is no departing tone in Old Chinese.
His monumental &quot;Shuowen Jiezi Zhu&quot; (說文解字注 &quot;Annotated &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;&quot;), which he spent 30 years to complete, was published shortly before his death (in 1815). Wang Niansun, in his preface to the work, says that &quot;it has been 1,700 years since a work of the same quality appeared&quot; (), suggesting that it is the greatest Chinese philological work since &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, which was published during the early 2nd century.

<text>Padmarajan Padmanabhan Pillai, better known as P. Padmarajan (23 May 1945 – 23 January 1991) was an Indian film maker, screenwriter and author who was known for his works in Malayalam literature and Malayalam cinema. He was the founder of a new school of film making in Malayalam cinema, along with Bharathan and K. G. George, in the 1980s.

Padmarajan was known for his detailed screenwriting and expressive direction style and made some of the landmark motion pictures in Malayalam cinema. He won the Kerala Sahithya Academy Award in 1972 for his novel &quot;Nakshathrangale Kaval&quot;. He made his directorial debut in 1979 with &quot;Peruvazhiyambalam&quot; which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam. He won his second National Award in 1986 with &quot;Thinkalaazhcha Nalla Divasam&quot;. Padmarajan had won six Kerala State Film Awards which includes two awards for Best Story in 1978, 1979 and two awards for Best Screenplay in 1984 and 1986. He has written screenplay for thirty seven movies among which eighteen he directed. The screenplay for all the movies he directed were written by Padmarajan himself. &quot;Njan Gandharvan&quot; was his last movie and within a week of its release, he died at Kozhikode due to sudden cardiac arrest.

==Early life==
Padmarajan was born on 23 May 1945 in Muthukulam near Haripad in Alappuzha, which was then under the princely state of Travancore. He was the sixth son of Thundathil Anantha Padmanabha Pillai and Njavarakkal Devaki Amma. After early schooling at Muthukulam, he studied at Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram and University College, Thiruvananthapuram, graduating with a B.Sc. in chemistry (1963). Subsequently, he learned Sanskrit from the scholar Cheppad Achyutha Warrier at Muthukulam. He then joined All India Radio, Trichur (1965), starting as a programme announcer, and later settled at Poojappura, Thiruvananthapuram(1968); he would remain at All India Radio until 1986 when his involvement in films prompted him to retire voluntarily.Padmarajan began his literary career during his stay at Thrissur and the friendships and experiences he gained during the period influenced his works thereafter.
After his move to Thiruvananthapuram, his reputation as a writer and participation among the literary circles in the capital flourished.It was during this early days that he appeared in a short cameo in the movie Kallichellamma which released in 1969. This is his only appearance in film as an actor.

==Career as screenwriter and director==

Padmarajan&#x27;s stories mainly deal with deceit, murder, romance, mystery, passion, jealousy, libertinism, anarchism, individualism, social structure, human psychology and life of peripheral elements of society. Some of them are considered among the best in Malayalam literature. In his films and stories, Padmarajan created characters that were complex, multidimensional, and deeply human. Padmarajan&#x27;s works were often inspired by real-life people and situations he witnessed, such as the tragic tale of a woman who committed suicide after being abandoned by her lover, which served as the basis for his film &quot;Thakara.&quot; He often drew inspiration from the people and situations he encountered in his daily life, such as the struggles of rural farmers or the complexities of urban relationships. The screenplay for all the movies he directed were written by Padmarajan himself. His first novel published in 1971 titled &quot;Nakshathrangale Kaaval&quot; (The Stars Alone Guard Me) won the Kerala Sahithya Academy award (1972).

He entered the world of Malayalam cinema by writing the screenplay for Prayanam (1975) which was Bharathan&#x27;s directorial debut and had the cinematography by Balu Mahendra. Rappadikalude Gatha (1978) was his third movie as a screenwriter which won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Story in 1978. His next work as a screenwriter was the classic erotic film Rathinirvedam (1978) which is regarded as a landmark in Indian film history.

After writing screenplay for three more films, Padmarajan made his directional debut in 1979 with &quot;Peruvazhiyambalam&quot; (&quot;The Halfway House&quot;). It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam and was included in IBN Live&#x27;s list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. His next directed Oridathoru Phayalvaan (&quot;There Lived a Wrestler&quot;) in 1981. Padmarajan also did the editing of this movie. It won the award for best script at the Kuala Lumpur International Film Festival and a gold medal at the Asian Film Festival. In 1982 he directed Novemberinte Nashtam which was critically acclaimed. Padmarajan&#x27;s Koodevide? (1983) won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value. In 1984, he wrote the screenplay for I. V Sasi&#x27;s Kanamarayathu, which won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Screenplay. In 1986 he directed Desatanakkili Karayarilla, which is one of the first Indian films that explored womance on screen. He won the second National Award with Thinkalazhcha Nalla Divasam in 1985. Padmarajan&#x27;s Kariyilakkattu Pole (1986) is considered one of the classic investigative thrillers in Malayalam. The same year he directed Arappatta Kettiya Gramathil which was a failure at box office. The plot of the movie which revolves around a brothel and the sex workers in it eventually developed a cult following.

With Mohanlal and Mammootty in the lead role, Padmarajan directed some of the cult classic movies in Malayalam such as &quot;Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal&quot; (1986), &quot;Arappatta Kettiya Gramathil&quot; (1986)&quot;, Kariyilakkattu Pole&quot; (1986), &quot;Thoovanathumbikal&quot; (1987) and &quot;Season&quot; (1989). Thoovanathumbikal was ranked eighth by IBN Live in its list of greatest Indian films of all time and is considered one of the best romantic movies ever made in Malayalam. &quot;Aparan&quot; (1988) is his another classic mystery psychological thriller which also marked the acting debut of Jayaram. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Screenplay in 1988. Moonnam Pakkam (1988) is another classic Padmarajan movie which was critically acclaimed. His 1990 movie Innale is mainly noted for the performance of Suresh Gopi. Padmarajan&#x27;s last movie Njan Gandharvan (1991) was a failure at box office. But the film later developed a cult following because of its aesthetics and storytelling. Within a week of its release, Padmarajan died at a hotel in Kozhikode. In total Padmarajan has written screenplay for 37 films among 18 of which he directed.

===Association with Bharathan===
Together with Bharathan and K. G. George, he successfully laid the foundation for a school of Malayalam cinema that strove to tread a middle ground by striking a fine balance. The term &quot;Parallel film&quot; is usually used to describe Padmarajan&#x27;s style of film making. Along with Bharathan, he displayed mastery in handling sexuality on the screen, hitherto less known in Malayalam cinema.

===Association with actors===
He was quite adept in spotting talent, and introduced many fresh faces who would later make their mark in Indian cinema, including Jayaram (&quot;Aparan&quot;), Ashokan (&quot;Peruvazhiyambalam&quot;), &quot;Rasheed&quot; (&quot;Oridathoru Phayalvaan&quot;), Rahman (&quot;Koodevide&quot;), Ramachandran (&quot;Novemberinte Nashtam&quot;), Ajayan (&quot;Moonnam Pakkam&quot;). Also artists like Nitish Bharadwaj (&quot;Njan Gandharvan&quot;), Suhasini (&quot;Koodevide&quot;); Shari (&quot;Namukku Parkkan Munthirithoppukal&quot;) were introduced to Malayalam screen by him.

He coaxed sparkling and inspired performances from many actors, such as Bharath Gopi, Mammootty, Mohanlal, Jayaram, Shobana, Sumalatha, Karamana Janardanan Nair, Rahman, Jagathy Sreekumar, Suresh Gopi, Thilakan, Nedumudi Venu and Ashokan; indeed, Thilakan&#x27;s rendition in &quot;Moonnam Pakkam&quot; is considered one of the best performance in his career. His association with Mohanlal and Mammootty was well noted especially because their films broke the conventional concepts prevailing during that time. He also aided in establishing, to a fair degree, the fame of other directors such as Bharathan, I. V. Sasi, and Mohan, through his association with them. His collaboration with Bharathan as a scriptwriter is considered to have produced remarkable works in Malayalam cinema. His assistants who went on to direct films independently include &quot;Thoppil Ajayan&quot; (&quot;Perumthachan&quot;), Suresh Unnithan&#x27;s (&quot;Jaathakam&quot;, &quot;Raadhaamaadhavam&quot;), and Blessy&#x27;s (&quot;Kaazhcha&quot;, &quot;Thanmaathra&quot;, the latter adapted from Padmarajan&#x27;s short story &quot;Orma&quot;.

==Film making==
Padmarajan is celebrated for his unparalleled attention to detail in his screenplays. Most of his films portrayed human relationships and emotions. Many of his films have haunting climaxes, most of them not commonly portrayed in Malayalam movies. His characters are portrayed with sensitivity and intensity on the screen. The landscape is also the major part of the Padmarajan&#x27;s craft in film making. His thesis were well crafted in his films. Padmarajan’s films explore the features of the landscape naturally.

Padmarajan&#x27;s screenplays had such hitherto-unheard of features and subjects – such as casting rain as a character in &quot;Thoovanathumbikal&quot; (&quot;Dragonflies in the drizzle&quot;), homosexual love in &quot;Desatanakkili Karayarilla&quot; (&quot;Migratory Birds Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;), unusual climax (by traditional standards) in &quot;Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal&quot; (&quot;Vineyards for us to dwell&quot;) and &quot;Oridathoru Phayalvaan&quot; (&quot;There Lived a Wrestler&quot;). Forbidden love and characters that strive to rise above the limitations of middle-class Malayali society of the seventies and eighties is a recurring theme in many of his works. Many of his films bear the mark of his romanticism.

==Personal life==
Padmarajan&#x27;s wife Radhalakshmi is from Chittur in Palakkad. Radhalakshmi was his colleague at AIR before their marriage in 1970. Radhalakshmi has written her reminiscences about him in her book &quot;Padmarajan Entaey Gandharvan&quot; (&quot;Padmarajan, my celestial lover&quot;). Their son, P. Ananthapadmanabhan, is a writer. They also have a daughter,Madhavikkutty.

Padmarajan died suddenly at Hotel Paramount Towers in Kozhikode in the early hours of 23 January 1991. He was staying at the hotel overnight in the middle of a promotional tour visiting the theatres playing his last film &quot;Njan Gandharvan&quot;. The cause of death was a massive cardiac arrest.

<doc id="483932" wikidata="Q904555" url="?curid=483932" title="Historical Chinese phonology">
<text>Historical Chinese phonology deals with reconstructing the sounds of Chinese from the past. As Chinese is written with logographic characters, not alphabetic or syllabary, the methods employed in Historical Chinese phonology differ considerably from those employed in, for example, Indo-European linguistics; reconstruction is more difficult because, unlike Indo-European languages, no phonetic spellings were used.

Chinese is documented over a long period of time, with the earliest oracle bone writings dated to c. 1250 BC. However, since the writing is mostly with logographic characters, which do not directly specify the phonology of the language, reconstruction is in general quite difficult, and depends to a large extent on ancillary sources that more directly document the language&#x27;s phonology. On the basis of these sources, historical Chinese is divided into the following basic periods:
*[[Old Chinese]], broadly from about 1250 BC to 25 AD, when the Han dynasty came back to power after the Xin dynasty. More narrowly, reconstructed &quot;Old Chinese&quot; is based on the rhymes of early poetry such as the Shijing and the phonological components of Chinese characters, and is assumed to represent the language of c. 1000-700 BC. Proto-Min developed from Old Chinese.
*[[Middle Chinese]], broadly from about the 5th century AD (Northern and Southern dynasties, Sui, Tang, Song) through to 12th century AD. More narrowly, reconstructed &quot;Middle Chinese&quot; is usually based on the detailed phonetic evidence of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; rime dictionary (601 AD), later expanded into &quot;Guangyun&quot;. The &quot;Qieyun&quot; describes a compromise between the northern and southern varieties and such rhyming dictionaries were essential to write and read aloud poetry with a rhyming pattern.
*Modern varieties, from about the 13th century AD (beginning of the Yuan dynasty, in which Early Mandarin was developed) to the present. Most modern varieties appear to have split off from a Late Middle Chinese koine of about 1000 AD (although some remnants of earlier periods are still present, ex. stops without release at the end of the syllable in Hakka and Yue).

== Overview ==
Middle Chinese had a structure much like many modern varieties, with largely monosyllabic words, little or no derivational morphology, four tone-classes (though three phonemic tones), and a syllable structure consisting of initial consonant, glide, main vowel and final consonant, with a large number of initial consonants and a fairly small number of final consonants. Not counting the glide, no clusters could occur at the beginning or end of a syllable.

Old Chinese, on the other hand, had a significantly different structure. Most scholars have concluded that there were no tones, a lesser imbalance between possible initial and final consonants, and a significant number of initial and final clusters. There was a well-developed system of derivational and possibly inflectional morphology, formed using consonants added onto the beginning or end of a syllable. This system is similar to the system reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan and still visible, for example, in the written Tibetan language; it is also largely similar to the system that occurs in the more conservative Mon–Khmer languages, such as modern Khmer (Cambodian).

The main changes leading to the modern varieties have been a reduction in the number of consonants and vowels and a corresponding increase in the number of tones (typically through a pan-East-Asiatic tone split that doubled the number of tones while eliminating the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants). This has led to a gradual decrease in the number of possible syllables. In Standard Mandarin, this has progressed to a farther extent than elsewhere, with only about 1,200 possible syllables. The result, in Mandarin especially, has been the proliferation of the number of two-syllable compound words, which have steadily replaced former monosyllabic words, to the extent that the majority of words in Standard Mandarin are now composed of two syllables.

==Periodization of Chinese==

The terms &quot;Old Chinese&quot; and &quot;Middle Chinese&quot; refer to long periods of time in and of themselves, during which significant changes occurred. Although there is no standard system for subdividing these periods, the following is an approximate chronology leading from the oldest writings in the oracle bone script up through modern Standard Mandarin:

#Axel Schuessler uses the term &quot;Early Zhou Chinese&quot; to refer to the language from the earliest records down to the end of the Western Zhou period (c. 1250 to 771 BC).
#W. A. C. H. Dobson uses the term &quot;Early Archaic Chinese&quot; to refer to the same period (&quot;10th to 9th century BC&quot;), although Schuessler suggests that the term should refer to a slightly later period.
#Dobson uses the term &quot;Late Archaic Chinese&quot; to refer to the &quot;4th to 3rd century BC&quot;; that is, the period near the beginning of the Han dynasty.
#&quot;Late Han Chinese&quot; (LHC) is c. 200 AD. This is around the time that Min Chinese varieties diverged from the others.
#&quot;Old Northwest Chinese&quot; (ONWC), c. 400 AD, is a reconstruction by Weldon South Coblin of the language of the northwestern Chinese provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi that is immediately ancestral to a set of northwestern dialects documented by various early Tang dynasty authors.
#&quot;Early Middle Chinese&quot; (EMC), c. 600 AD, is the language of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; rime dictionary, the first stage for which we have direct and detailed phonetic evidence. This evidence is not enough by itself to directly determine the sound system of the language, however, as it only subdivides characters into an initial consonant and non-initial portion, without further decomposing the latter into phonemes.
#&quot;Late Middle Chinese&quot; (LMC), c. 1000 AD, is the native language of the authors of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; rime table and the oldest stage that can be reconstructed from modern non-Min varieties by the comparative method.
#&quot;Early Mandarin&quot;, c. 1300 AD (sometimes specifically given as 1269–1455. The Yuan dynasty conquered the whole of China in 1279 and was overpowered by the Ming dynasty in 1368), was the language inferred in the &#x27;Phags-pa script, the first alphabetic writing system for Chinese. It is also documented in the &quot;Zhōngyuán Yīnyùn&quot; ( &quot;Sounds and Rhymes of the Central Plains&quot;, an opera manual of 1324 AD written by Zhou Deqing).
#&quot;Middle Mandarin&quot;, up through c. 1800 (sometimes specifically given as 1455–1795), documented in numerous Chinese, Korean and European sources. Among these are Chinese-Korean pedagogical texts such as &quot;Hongmu Chôngyun Yôkhun&quot; (1455) and &quot;Sasông T’onghae&quot; (1517); the Portuguese-Chinese dictionary (1583–1588) of the Christian missionaries Matteo Ricci and Michele Ruggieri; a dictionary by a friar, Basilio Brollo (1692-1694), also known as Basile da Glemona, a grammar of Mandarin by Francisco Varo (1703) and Chinese rhyme manuals such as the &quot;Yunlüe Huitong&quot; (1642).
#Modern &quot;Standard Chinese&quot;, a standardized form of the dialect of Beijing that is little changed from the 19th century. It was promulgated during the Republic of China in 1932. Today, it is the standard variety in the PRC, founded by Mao Zedong in 1949.

==Chinese native phonological traditions==

A native tradition of Chinese phonology developed in the Middle Chinese period. Chinese linguists had long compiled dictionaries and attempted to identify the pronunciation of difficult characters by specifying homophone characters. During the early centuries AD, however, the more advanced method of &quot;fanqie&quot; was developed, which allowed the pronunciation of any syllable to be specified unambiguously by using one character to indicate the initial consonant and another to indicate the remainder. By the sixth century AD, systematic attempts were made to compile lists of all characters and specify their pronunciation by way of fanqie, culminating in rime dictionaries such as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601 AD).

During the next few centuries, the increasing influence of Buddhism and Buddhist scholars brought Chinese linguists in touch with the tradition of Sanskrit grammar, which included a highly advanced understanding of phonology and phonetics, including a system of analyzing sounds by distinctive features, such as place of articulation and type of phonation. This led to rime tables such as the Yunjing (c. 1150 AD), a sophisticated analysis of the sound system of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;.

During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), scholars such as Duan Yucai diligently studied the sound system of Middle and Old Chinese. Through careful examination of rime tables, rime dictionaries and patterns of rhyming among poets of various eras, these scholars were able to work out the system of categories of rhymes in Old Chinese, and discover additional Middle Chinese categories that had previously been overlooked. However, progress in Chinese linguistics was seriously hampered by the lack of any concept of a phoneme — i.e. a basic unit of sound, including vowels and vowel-like segments as well as consonants. This made it impossible to go beyond determination of systems of rhyming categories to reconstruction of the actual sounds involved.

In some ways, the lack of native Chinese development of the concept of a unit of sound is surprising, as it had already been developed by Sanskrit grammarians such as Pāṇini by the 4th century BC at the latest, and the phonological analysis of the Yunjing shows a close familiarity with the tradition of Sanskrit grammar. Furthermore, some non-Chinese writing systems within the Chinese cultural orbit, such as the Korean script and especially the Tibetan script, were developed under the close influence of Indian writing systems and have the concept of phoneme directly embedded in them. (Furthermore, the &#x27;Phags-pa script, an alphabetic script of Tibetan origin, had been used to write Chinese itself during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, c. 1270–1360, although it later fell out of use.) It seems likely, however, that
#The strong influence and long tradition of Chinese writing, which included no concept of an alphabet and always treated the rhyming part of a syllable as a single unit, made it difficult to independently develop the concept of a unit of sound.
#Lack of knowledge of Sanskrit by most Chinese scholars precluded direct reading of the original works on Sanskrit grammar.
#Cultural attitudes that treated Koreans, Tibetans, Mongolians and most other foreigners as &quot;barbarians&quot; made it difficult for scientific knowledge from these cultures to diffuse into China.

==Modern methods of reconstruction==
As a result, the first reconstructions of the actual sound systems of Old and Middle Chinese were only done in the early 20th century, by Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren. Armed with his knowledge of Western historical linguistics, he performed field work in China between 1910 and 1912, creating a list of 3,100 Chinese characters and collecting phonological data on the pronunciation of these characters in 19 Mandarin dialects as well as the dialects of Shanghai (Wu), Fuzhou (Eastern Min), and Guangdong (Cantonese). He combined this with the Sino-Japanese and Sino-Vietnamese pronunciations as well as previously published material on nine other dialects, along with the &quot;fanqie&quot; analysis of the Guangyun rime dictionary (a later version of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; of 601 AD). In 1915, he published his reconstruction of Middle Chinese, which underlies in one form or another all subsequent reconstructions. Walter Simon and Henri Maspero also made great contributions in the field during the early days of its development. Karlgren himself had no direct access to the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, which was thought lost; however, fragments of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; were discovered in the Dunhuang Caves in the 1930s, and a nearly complete copy was discovered in 1947 in the Palace Museum.

Karlgren was also instrumental in early reconstruction of Old Chinese. His early work on Middle Chinese made various suggestions about Old Chinese, and a detailed reconstruction appeared in &quot;Grammata Serica&quot; (1940), a dictionary of Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions. An expanded version, &quot;Grammata Serica Recensa&quot;, was published in 1957 and is still a commonly cited source.

The reconstruction of Middle Chinese draws its data (in approximate order of importance) from:

*Rime dictionaries and rime tables of the Middle Chinese era, such as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601 AD) and &quot;Yunjing&quot; (c. 1150 AD).
*Modern Chinese speaking variants such as Yue, Hakka, Mandarin, Min, Wu etc.
*Sino-Xenic data — Chinese loanwords borrowed in large numbers into Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean, especially during the period of 500–1000 AD. This large-scale borrowing led to the so-called Sino-Vietnamese, Sino-Japanese and Sino-Korean vocabularies of these languages.
*Other early cases of Chinese words borrowed into foreign languages or transcribed in foreign sources, e.g. Sanskrit works in India.
*Early cases of transliteration of foreign words from other languages such as Sanskrit and Tibetan into Chinese.
*Chinese written in the &#x27;Phags-pa script, a brief period (c. 1270–1360) when Chinese was written in an alphabetic script.
*Transcriptions of Chinese by foreigners, especially the Hangul transcriptions of Koreans such as Sin Sukchu (15th century) and works by various Christian missionaries and other Westerners, the oldest of which is Matteo Ricci&#x27;s Portuguese–Chinese dictionary of 1583–1588. (Although these transcriptions, as well as the &#x27;Phags-pa evidence, are significant in providing extensive documentation of earlier forms of Mandarin Chinese, their importance for reconstructing Middle Chinese pales in comparison with the much greater breadth provided by the pronunciation of Chinese variants and Sino-Xenic languages, despite their later attestation.)

Karlgren suggested that the Middle Chinese documented in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; was a live language of the Sui-Tang period. Today, with direct access to the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, this notion has been replaced by the view that the sound system in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; represents (or proposes) a literate reading adopted by the literate class of the period throughout the country, not any live language that once existed. For example, in some cases a former three-way distinction A, B, C among initials or finals gave way to a situation where one dialect group of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; period merged AB vs. C, while another group merged A vs. BC. In these cases, the &quot;Qieyun&quot; specifies A, B, C as all distinct, even though no living dialect of the time period made such a three-way distinction, and any earlier dialect that did make this distinction would have differed in other ways from the &quot;Qieyun&quot; system.

The reconstruction of Old Chinese is more controversial than that of Middle Chinese since it has to be extrapolated from the Middle Chinese data. Phonological information concerning Old Chinese is chiefly gained from:

*The rhymed texts written before the Qin dynasty, chiefly the &quot;Shijing&quot;, the earliest anthology of Chinese poetry.
*The fact that characters sharing the same phonetic component had very similar pronunciations when the characters were first created.
*Comparison of Old Chinese with other Sino-Tibetan dialects.

== Old Chinese phonology ==
There are disagreements over exactly what the Old Chinese (OC) syllable looked like. The following is an approximate consensus, based on the system of William Baxter and (earlier) Li Fang-Kuei:
#A syllable consisted of an initial consonant, an optional medial glide (but no or ), a main vowel, an optional final (coda) consonant, and an optional post-final consonant or . There were also various pre-initial consonants. (In recent systems, Baxter also constructs a distinction between &quot;tightly bound&quot; pre-initials and &quot;loosely bound&quot; pre-initials . The tightly bound pre-initials interact in complex ways with the initial to produce EMC initials, but the loosely bound pre-initials mostly just disappear. Their presence, however, is revealed by the use of a &quot;phonetic complement&quot; with the corresponding tightly bound pre-initial in their character, and sometimes by early borrowings into other languages, especially Hmong–Mien languages and Tai languages.) Pre-initial and post-final consonants were frequently used in morphological derivation.
#There was no MC-style tone, but there was a distinction of some sort between type-A and type-B syllables. Depending on the linguist, the distinction is variously thought to reflect either presence or absence of prefixes, an accentual or length distinction on the main vowel, or some sort of register distinction (e.g. pharyngealization of the initial consonant in type-A syllables). These different reconstructions may not be mutually exclusive (e.g. an earlier prefix distinction may have developed into a later register distinction).
#Compared with EMC, there were no palatal or retroflex consonants, but there were labiovelar consonants (e.g. ). Baxter also reconstructs voiceless resonants, e.g. , .
#There were on the order of six main vowels: , , , , , (or ).
#The system of final (coda) consonants was similar to EMC; however, there was no . Baxter also reconstructs final , later becoming .

==From Old Chinese to Early Middle Chinese==
===Initial consonants===

====Palatalisation of velar initials====
William H. Baxter pointed out that some of the words that were reconstructed with Middle Chinese palatal initials were perhaps words that had velar initials in Old Chinese. For example, Baxter indicated that , reconstructed as &quot;nyet&quot; in Middle Chinese, was perhaps pronounced as &quot;ngjet&quot; in Old Chinese. He noted the distinction between (&quot;tsye&quot;), which had a MC palatal initial, and , which had a velar initial in MC (&quot;gjeX&quot;, III), despite their common phonetic component. Some modern Min and Hakka varieties nonetheless retain velar initials in both. The two are reconstructed by Baxter to be &quot;kje&quot; and &quot;grjeʔ&quot; respectively in Old Chinese. Baxter posited that the medial -rj- cluster had blocked palatalisation.

====Lenition of OC /ɡ/====
The voiced velar plosive, *, was lenited to a voiced fricative (*) during this development from Old Chinese to Middle Chinese. According to Laurent Sagart, this change is reflected when the Old Chinese plosive occurred in type A syllables. This is supported by Baxter&#x27;s observation that modern Min dialects show a difference in pronunciation between and , both of which belong to the Middle Chinese initial (reconstructed as *). For the first character, the Fuzhou dialect, Amoy Hokkien and the Teochew dialect, show pronunciations with a velar plosive (*). This pronunciation is consistent with an earlier pronunciation with a velar plosive, most likely the Old Chinese *. The second character is pronounced by these dialects with a null initial, possibly reflecting a voiced laryngeal in Old Chinese. The OC * remained intact in Type B syllables, which correspond to Division III Middle Chinese words.

====Retroflex initials====
The loss of the reconstructed OC medial &quot;r&quot;, or the r-infix in Sagart&#x27;s reconstruction, had not only influenced vowel quality in Middle Chinese but had also caused the retroflexion of coronal consonants.

====Sonorant fortition====
Both Baxter and Sagart have pointed out that Old Chinese had a series of voiceless sonorants, which typically do not occur in most modern varieties. These voiceless sonorants are , , , , , and possibly . Their reflexes in Middle Chinese are postulated to be:

Additionally, the OC lateral consonant is shown to have fortified to a coronal plosive in Type A syllables. Meanwhile, it developed into in Type B syllables, which palatalised in Middle Chinese. Sagart pointed out, however, that these changes are not true if the lateral is preceded by a reconstructed prefix. This position, whereby OC underwent fortition to become a plosive, is upheld by Baxter. Baxter pointed out &quot;xiesheng&quot; contacts between plosive series, sibilants and MC , and made the following reconstructions:
Note that these reconstructions included voiceless sonorants, of which the developments have been consistent with their fortition and reflexes.

According to Sagart, this fortition was impeded if the lateral was preceded by an unspecified consonant or minor syllable. He reconstructs as , yielding MC . Furthermore, MC was said to have derived from an OC .

===Medials and finals===
The following are the main developments that produced Early Middle Chinese (EMC) from Old Chinese (OC):
*Type-B syllables developed a glide. This glide combined with a previous coronal consonant to produce new palatal consonants. It also sometimes turned a preceding velar or laryngeal into a palatal sibilant and/or raised a following main vowel. (Contrarily, type-A syllables often lowered a following main vowel, with a high vowel diphthongizing, e.g. becoming .)
*The glide eventually disappeared, but before doing this it turned a previous coronal consonant into a retroflex consonant, and fronted (and often centralized) a following main vowel.
*Changes to final consonants: became ; dropped after ; dropped before ; before became (which remained, even after ).
*Tones developed from the former suffixes (post-final consonants), with MC tone 3 (&quot;departing&quot;, reconstructed as having falling pitch) developing from , tone 2 (&quot;rising&quot;, reconstructed as having rising pitch) developing from , and tone 1 (&quot;level&quot;, reconstructed as having level pitch) from other syllables. As the suffixes were part of the derivational morphology of OC, this often produced MC tonal variation, either in a single word or in semantically related words.
*Back vowels and , when followed by a coronal consonant (, , , ), broke into plus a front vowel.
*Labiovelar initials were reanalyzed as a velar followed a glide, which merged with from breaking of and .
*The main vowel developed in various complicated ways, depending on the surrounding sounds. For example, in type-A syllables, according to Baxter&#x27;s reconstruction, OC became after ; otherwise, after coronal initials, after velar initials, and after labial initials. In type-B syllables, however, OC became after or coronal initial, but otherwise.

Note that OC type-B syllables correspond closely to division-III, and (in Baxter&#x27;s reconstruction at least) to EMC syllables with or .

==From Early Middle Chinese to Late Middle Chinese==
To a large degree, Late Middle Chinese (LMC) of c. 1000 AD can be viewed as the direct ancestor of all Chinese varieties except Min Chinese; in other words, attempting to reconstruct the parent language of all varieties excluding Min leads no farther back than LMC. See below for more information.
Exactly which changes occurred between EMC and LMC depends on whose system of EMC and/or LMC reconstruction is used. In the following, Baxter&#x27;s EMC reconstruction is compared to Pulleyblank&#x27;s LMC reconstruction. To the extent that these two systems reflect reality, they may be significantly farther apart than the 400 or so years normally given between EMC and LMC, since Baxter&#x27;s EMC system was designed to harmonize with Old Chinese while Pulleyblank&#x27;s LMC system was designed to harmonize with later Mandarin developments. Furthermore, Baxter considers all the distinctions of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; to be real, while many of them are clearly anachronisms that no longer applied to any living form of the language in 600 AD. Finally, some of the resulting &quot;changes&quot; may not be actual changes at all so much as conceptual differences in the way the systems have been reconstructed; these are noted below.

Changes mostly involve initials, medials, and main vowels.
*The class of EMC palatals is lost, with palatal sibilants becoming retroflex sibilants and the palatal nasal becoming a new phoneme .
*A new class of labiodentals emerges, from EMC labials followed by and an EMC back vowel.
*EMC complex medial becomes , producing a six-way medial distinction between none, , , , , . The phonemic glides and are vocalic and before short vowels and , but semivocalic and before long vowel .
*The eight-way EMC distinction in main vowels is significantly modified, developing into a system with high vowels , , and (marginally) , and non-high vowels , , . However, this is best analyzed as a system with a four-way main vowel distinction between no vowel and the three phonemic vowels , , ; high vowels are then analyzed as phonemically consisting of a medial and no main vowel ( is phonemically a syllable containing only a bare consonant, with no medial and no main vowel).
*High front medials/main vowels and are lost after EMC retroflex sibilants, prior to merging with palatals; contrarily, a sometimes appears after guttural consonants.

Few changes to final consonants occur; the main ones are the loss of after a high vowel, the disappearance of (which might or might not be reckoned as a final consonant) in the rhyme , and (potentially) the appearance of and (which are suspect in various ways; see below).

The tones do not change phonemically. However, allophonically they evidently split into a higher-pitched allophone in syllables with voiceless initials, and a lower-pitched allophone in syllables with voiced initials. All modern Chinese varieties reflect such a split, which produces a new set of phonemic tones in most varieties due to later loss of voicing distinctions.

The following changes are in approximate order.

===Labiodentalization===
Early Middle Chinese (EMC) labials () become Late Middle Chinese (LMC) labiodentals (, possibly from earlier affricates) in certain circumstances involving a following glide. When this happens, the glide disappears. Using Baxter&#x27;s reconstruction, the triggering circumstances can be expressed simply as whenever a labial is followed by a glide and the main vowel is a back vowel; other reconstructions word the rule differently. According to Baxter, however, labiodentalization might have occurred independently of each other in different areas. For example, some variants retain OC /m/ before the glide, while in other variants, it had developed into a labiodental initial (): compare Cantonese &quot;man4&quot; and Mandarin &quot;wén&quot;.

===Vowel changes and mergers===

In approximate order:

;a. Some early changes
# (without medial ) becomes after labial, velar and glottal consonants, elsewhere. (Along with certain later changes, this means that, synchronically, an LMC speaker cannot distinguish original Division IV syllables from original III-4 &quot;chongniu&quot; syllables; likewise for Division III vs. III-3 &quot;chongniu&quot;. This explains why these &quot;chongniu&quot; pairs end up in grades 3 and 4, respectively.) A change of this sort occurs in all modern reconstructions of EMC and LMC, and is responsible for the creation of Division IV.
# and after a non-high front vowel (, , ) become and (often viewed as palatalized final consonants). This may not be a real change; Pulleyblank&#x27;s EMC system already includes and , whereas they are not present in any modern dialect. The most direct evidence for these sounds comes from Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, which was borrowed from LMC and does reflect the sounds. In Pulleyblank&#x27;s LMC system, only occurs in the rhymes and , which contrast with and ; likewise for . ( and do not contrast before velar finals, except possibly after EMC retroflex sibilants.) These contrasts would be reflected in some other way in a system without and .
# The sequence merges into . In some dialects, however, it instead remains separate (perhaps in the form , not otherwise occurring in Baxter&#x27;s system). According to Abraham Y.S. Chan, the former change was characteristic of the Luoyang dialect, while the latter reflected the Jinling dialect. The distinction between the two surfaces in Standard Mandarin as a respective distinction between &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;ya&quot;, or &quot;pai/pei&quot; and &quot;pa&quot;.

;b. Mergers of high-front finals
#EMC finals , , , merge into ; likewise (which occurs before and ) becomes .
#The &quot;hekou&quot; equivalents of the above (with additional medial ) become .
#The III-4 &quot;chongniu&quot; equivalents of both of the above become and , respectively.

;c. Changes involving high back vowels, mostly generating 
#EMC final becomes ; likewise, becomes . (Possibly not a real change.)
#The EMC sequence becomes , and becomes .
#All remaining , except in the sequences and , become .
#All non-final become , and become .

;d. Changes involving non-high vowels
#When there is no medial , remaining and become .
#All remaining , , , become .

;e. Changes involving medials
#Non-final and become , while become .
#The medials and merge into a single phoneme, with occurring before and , and elsewhere (before and high vowels). Medial and merge in the same way.

;f. Medial and similar changes triggered by specific initials
# appears between a guttural consonant (velar or laryngeal) and a directly following . This sets the stage for palatalized syllables in Standard Mandarin such as &quot;jia&quot; and &quot;xian&quot;.
#A final directly following a dental sibilant becomes (presumably ).
#After an EMC retroflex sibilant, a directly following high-front vowel or glide ( or , along with front-rounded or , if reconstructed) is removed, specifically:
##A glide is lost.
##A main vowel becomes if non-final.
##A main vowel becomes (presumably ) if final.
##If high front-rounded vocalics are reconstructed, they unround ( -&gt; , -&gt; ).

===Late changes to initial consonants===

*EMC palatals become retroflex, with palatal sibilants merging with retroflex sibilants and palatal becoming a new phoneme (still reflected as such in Standard Mandarin).
*Voiced consonants are thought to have become breathy voiced. This is a non-phonemic change; it is postulated to account for the breathy-voiced consonants still present in Wu Chinese, and the common outcome elsewhere of originally voiced consonants as unvoiced aspirates. Karlgren reconstructed breathy voicing for EMC as well, but this is no longer thought to be the case due to lack of any evidence for it in borrowings to or from EMC (especially involving Sanskrit and Middle Indic languages, which had a distinction between normally voiced and breathy-voiced consonants). This may have occurred to differing extents in different places:
**Among the two Chinese varieties that have not merged voiced and unvoiced consonants, Wu reflects the EMC voiced consonants as breathy voiced, but Old Xiang reflects them as normally voiced.
**Gan and Hakka reflect all EMC voiced consonants as unvoiced aspirates, but many others (e.g. Mandarin) only have such aspirated consonants in syllables within the &quot;yang ping&quot; tone, the light-level tone. Similarly, many words in Hokkien Min that are read with the &quot;yang ping&quot; tone are unaspirated, developing from Old Chinese and Middle Chinese voiced initials. Some words have aspirated readings, however, which led some linguists to believe that there may be a voiced aspirated series in the Proto-Min language, which had branched off from Old Chinese before it developed into Middle Chinese.

==From Late Middle Chinese to Standard Mandarin==

===Initials===

*Voiced stops and sibilants were devoiced; the stops became aspirated in syllables with tone 1 and unaspirated otherwise.
*Retroflex stops merged into retroflex affricates.
*Sonorants: retroflex nasal merged into alveolar nasal; , formerly palatal nasal in EMC, became or sometimes the syllable &quot;er&quot;; velar nasal was dropped.
*Before high front vowel or glide, velars (&quot;back-tooth&quot; stops and &quot;throat&quot; fricatives) and alveolar sibilants palatalized and merged as a new series of alveolo-palatal sibilants.
*The glottal stop was dropped; before a high front glide, the voiced velar fricative was dropped.
*Labiodentals: , devoiced, merged into ; became . (LMC labiodentals resulted from EMC labials preceding + back vowel.)

The following table illustrates the evolution of initials from Early Middle Chinese, through Late Middle Chinese, to Standard Mandarin.

===Finals===
In general, Mandarin preserves the LMC system of medials and main vowels fairly well (better than most other varieties) but drastically reduces the system of codas (final consonants). The systematic changes to medials and main vowels are loss of the &quot;chongniu&quot; distinctions &quot;i/ji&quot; and &quot;y/jy&quot; (which occur in all modern varieties) and loss of the distinction between and . All final stop consonants are lost, and final nasals are reduced to a distinction between and .

The exact changes involving finals are somewhat complex and not always predictable, in that in many circumstances there are multiple possible outcomes. The following is a basic summary; more information can be found in the table of EMC finals in Middle Chinese.

Changes to medials:
*LMC medial classes and merge, losing the ; likewise for and .
*LMC front medials and (and corresponding main vowels) are lost after retroflex consonants. The operation of this change is exactly as for the similar change that occurred after EMC retroflexes. The difference between EMC retroflex and palatal sibilants is sometimes reflected in Mandarin, for example between &quot;she&quot; (EMC retroflex) and &quot;shi&quot; (EMC palatal).
*LMC medial is lost after labials, and unrounds to .
*LMC medial is sometimes lost after and .
*Various other changes occur after particular initials.

Changes to main vowels:
*Long vowel shortens.
*Various other complex changes; see Middle Chinese.

Changes to codas:
*LMC coda becomes .
*LMC stop codas are dropped, with sometimes becoming and .
*LMC complex codas and become simple codas; likewise for and , but often with effects on the preceding vowel.

===Tones===
A tone split occurs as a result of the loss of the voicing distinction in initial consonants. The split tones then merge back together except for Middle Chinese tone 1; hence Middle Chinese tones 1,2,3 become Mandarin tones 1,2,3,4. (Some syllables with original Mandarin tone 3 move to tone 4; see below.) Syllables with a final stop consonant, originally toneless, get assigned to one of the four modern tones; for syllables with Middle Chinese unvoiced initials, this happens in a completely random fashion.

The specific relationship between Middle Chinese and modern tones:

:V− = unvoiced initial consonant ( or )
:L = sonorant initial consonant ( )
:V+ = voiced initial consonant (not sonorant) ( )


==Branching off of the modern varieties==

Most modern Chinese varieties can be viewed as descendants of Late Middle Chinese (LMC) of c. 1000 AD. For example, all modern varieties other than Min Chinese have labiodental fricatives (e.g. ), a change that occurred after Early Middle Chinese (EMC) of c. 600 AD. In fact, some post-LMC changes are reflected in all modern varieties, such as the loss of the &quot;chongniu&quot; distinction (between e.g. and , using Edwin Pulleyblank&#x27;s transcription). Other changes occurring in most modern varieties, such as the loss of initial voiced obstruents and corresponding tone split, are areal changes that spread across existing dialects; possibly the loss of &quot;chongniu&quot; distinctions can be viewed in the same way.

Min Chinese, on the other hand, is known to have branched off &quot;even before&quot; Early Middle Chinese (EMC) of c. 600 AD. Not only does it not reflect the development of labiodental fricatives or other LMC-specific changes, but a number of features already present in EMC appear never developed. An example is the series of retroflex stops in EMC, which developed from earlier alveolar stops followed by , and which later merged with retroflex sibilants. In Min, the corresponding words still have alveolar stops. This difference can be seen in the words for &quot;tea&quot; borrowed into various other languages: For example, Spanish &quot;te&quot;, English &quot;tea&quot; vs. Portuguese &quot;chá&quot;, English &quot;chai&quot;, reflecting the Amoy (Southern Min) vs. Standard Mandarin .

In the case of distinctions that appear to have never developed in Min, it could be argued that the ancestral language did in fact have these distinctions, but they later disappeared. For example, it could be argued that Min varieties descend from a Middle Chinese dialect where retroflex stops merged back into alveolar stops instead of merging with retroflex sibilants. However, this argument cannot be made if there are distinctions in Min that do not appear in EMC (and which reflect ancient features going back to Old Chinese or – ultimately – even Proto-Sino-Tibetan, so that they cannot be explained as secondary developments), and this does indeed appear to be the case. In particular, Proto-Min (the reconstructed ancestor of the Min varieties) appears to have had six series of stops corresponding to the three series (unvoiced, unvoiced aspirated, voiced) of Middle Chinese. The additional three series are voiced aspirated (or breathy voiced), unvoiced &quot;softened&quot;, and voiced &quot;softened&quot;.

Evidence for the voiced aspirated stops comes from tonal distinctions among the stops. When voiced stops became unvoiced in most varieties and triggered a tone split, words with these stops moved into new lowered (so-called &quot;yang&quot;) tone classes, while words with unvoiced stops appeared in raised (so-called &quot;yin&quot;) tone classes. The result is that the &quot;yin&quot; classes have words with both aspirated and unaspirated stops, while the &quot;yang&quot; classes have only one of the two, depending on how the formerly voiced stops developed. Min varieties, however, have both kinds of words in &quot;yang&quot; classes as well as &quot;yin&quot; classes. This has caused scholars to reconstruct voiced aspirates (probably realized as breathy voiced consonants) in Proto-Min, which develop into unvoiced aspirates in &quot;yang&quot;-class words.

In addition, in some Min varieties, some words with EMC stops are reflected with stops while others are reflected with &quot;softened&quot; consonants, typically voiced fricatives or approximants. Such &quot;softened stops&quot; occur in both &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; classes, suggesting that Proto-Min had both unvoiced and voiced &quot;softened stops&quot;. Presumably &quot;softened stops&quot; were actually fricatives of some sort, but it is unclear exactly what they were.

Scholars generally assume that these additional Proto-Min sounds reflect distinctions in Old Chinese that vanished in Early Middle Chinese but remained in Proto-Min. Until recently, no reconstructions of Old Chinese specifically accounted for the Proto-Min distinctions, but the recent reconstruction of William Baxter and Laurent Sagart accounts for both voiced aspirates and softened stops. According to them, voiced aspirates reflect Old Chinese stops in words with particular consonant prefixes, while softened stops reflect Old Chinese stops in words with a minor syllable prefix, so that the stop occurred between vowels. The postulated development of the softened stops is very similar to the development of voiced fricatives in Vietnamese, which likewise occur in both &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; varieties and are reconstructed as developing from words with minor syllables.

<text>The Baiyue, Hundred Yue, or simply Yue, were various ethnic groups who inhabited the regions of southern China and northern Vietnam during the 1st millennium BC and 1st millennium AD. They were known for their short hair, body tattoos, fine swords, and naval prowess.

During the Warring States period, the word &quot;Yue&quot; referred to the state of Yue in Zhejiang. The later kingdoms of Minyue in Fujian and Nanyue in Guangdong were both considered Yue states. During the Zhou and Han dynasties, the Yue lived in a vast territory from Jiangsu to Yunnan, while Barlow (1997:2) indicates that the Luoyue occupied the southwest Guangxi and northern Vietnam. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; describes the various Yue tribes and peoples can be found from the regions of Kuaiji to Jiaozhi.

The Yue tribes were gradually assimilated into Chinese culture as the Han empire expanded into what is now southern China and northern Vietnam. Many modern southern Chinese languages bear traces of substrate languages originally spoken by the ancient Yue. Variations of the name are still used for the name of modern Vietnam, in Zhejiang-related names including Yue opera, the Yue Chinese language, and in the abbreviation for Guangdong.

==Names==
The modern term &quot;Yue&quot; (; Early Middle Chinese: ) comes from Old Chinese . It was first written using the pictograph for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (), and later as . At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the &quot;Yangyue&quot;, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC &quot;Yue&quot; referred to the state of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. According to Ye Wenxian, as cited by Wan, the ethnonym of the Yuefang in northwestern China is not associated with that of the Baiyue in southeastern China.

The term Baiyue first appears in the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, compiled around 239 BC. It was later used as a collective term for many non-Huaxia/Han Chinese populations of Southern China and Northern Vietnam.

Ancient texts mention a number of Yue states or groups. Most of these names survived into early imperial times:

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
According to Chunming Wu, the prehistoric ancestors of the Baiyue were actively involved in seafaring in southeastern China. They communicated with the proto-Austronesians in Southeast Asia and Pacific archipelagos.

===Yuyue===
During the early Zhou dynasty, the Chinese came into contact with a people known as the Yuyue, but it is uncertain if they had any connection with the later Yue.

===Wu and Yue===
From the 9th century BC, two northern Yue tribes on the southeastern coastline of China, the Gouwu and Yuyue, came under the cultural influence of their northern Chinese neighbours. These two peoples were based in the areas of what is now southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, respectively. Traditional accounts attribute the cultural exchange to Taibo, a Zhou dynasty prince who had self-exiled to the south. During the Spring and Autumn period, the Gouwu founded the state of Wu and the Yuyue the state of Yue. The Wu and Yue peoples hated each other and had an intense rivalry but were indistinguishable from each other to the other Chinese states. It is suggested in some sources that their distinctive appearance made them victims of discrimination abroad.

The northern Wu eventually became the more sinicized of the two states. The royal family of Wu claimed descent from King Wen of Zhou as the founder of their dynasty. King Fuchai of Wu made every effort to assert this claim and was the source of much contention among his contemporaries. Some scholars believe the Wu royalty may have been Chinese and ethnically distinct from the people they ruled. The recorded history of Wu began with King Shoumeng (). He was succeeded in succession by his sons King Zhufan (), King Yuji (, and King Yumei (). The brothers all agreed to exclude their sons from the line of succession and to eventually pass the throne to their youngest brother, Prince Jizha, but when Yumei died, a succession crisis erupted which saw his son King Liao taking the throne. Not much is known about their reigns as Yue history largely concentrates on the last two Wu kings, Helü of Wu, who killed his cousin Liao, and his son Fuchai of Wu.

Records for the southern state of Yue begin with the reign of King Yunchang (d. 497 BC). According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the Yue kings were descended from Shao Kang of the Xia dynasty. According to another source, the kings of Yue were related to the royal family of Chu. Other sources simply name the Yue ruling family as the house of Zou. There is no scholarly consensus on the origin of the Yue or their royalty.

Wu and Yue spent much of the time at war with each other, during which Yue gained a fearsome reputation for its martial valour:

Almost nothing is known about the organizational structure of the Wu and Yue states. Wu records only mention its ministers and kings while Yue records only mention its kings, and of these kings only Goujian&#x27;s life is recorded in any appreciable detail. Goujian&#x27;s descendants are listed but aside from their succession of each other until 330 BC, when Yue was conquered by Chu, nothing else about them is known. Therefore, the lower echelons of Wu–Yue society remain shrouded in mystery, appearing only in reference to their strange clothing, tattoos, and short hair by northern Chinese states. After the fall of Yue, the ruling family moved south to what is now Fujian and established the kingdom of Minyue. There they stayed, outside the reach of Chinese history until the end of the Warring States period and the rise of the Qin dynasty.

In 512 BC, Wu launched a large expedition against the large state of Chu, based in the Middle Yangtze River. A similar campaign in 506 succeeded in sacking the Chu capital Ying. Also in that year, war broke out between Wu and Yue and continued with breaks for the next three decades. Wu campaigns against other states such as Jin and Qi are also mentioned. In 473, King Goujian of Yue finally conquered Wu and was acknowledged by the northern states of Qi and Jin. In 333, Yue was in turn conquered by Chu.

===Qin dynasty===
After the unification of China by Qin Shi Huang, the former Wu and Yue states were absorbed into the nascent Qin empire. The Qin armies also advanced south along the Xiang River to modern Guangdong and set up commanderies along the main communication routes. Motivated by the region&#x27;s vast land and valuable exotic products, Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have sent half a million troops divided into five armies to conquer the lands of the Yue. The Yue defeated the first attack by Qin troops and killed the Qin commander. A passage from &quot;Huainanzi&quot; of Liu An quoted by Keith Taylor (1991:18) describing the Qin defeat as follows:
Afterwards, Qin Shi Huang sent reinforcements to defend against the Yue. In 214 BC, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Lingqu Canal, which linked the north and south so that reinforcements could be transported to modern Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam, which were subjugated and reorganized into three prefectures within the Qin empire. Qin Shi Huang imposed sinicisation by sending a large number of Chinese military agricultural colonists to what are now eastern Guangxi and western Guangdong.

===Minyue and Dong&#x27;ou===

When the Qin fell in 206 BC, the hegemon-king Xiang Yu did not make Zou Wuzhu and Zou Yao kings. For this reason they refused to support him and instead joined Liu Bang in attacking Xiang Yu. When Liu Bang won the war in 202 BC, he made Zou Wuzhu king of Minyue; in 192, Zou Yao was made the king of Dong&#x27;ou. Both Minyue and Dong&#x27;ou claimed descent from Goujian.

In 154, Liu Pi, the King of Wu, revolted against the Han and tried to persuade Minyue and Dong&#x27;ou to join him. The king of Minyue refused but Dong&#x27;ou sided with the rebels. However, when Liu Pi was defeated and fled to Dong&#x27;ou, they killed him to appease the Han, and therefore escaped any retaliation. Liu Pi&#x27;s son, Liu Ziju, fled to Minyue and worked to incite a war between the Minyue and Dong&#x27;ou.

In 138, Minyue attacked Dong&#x27;ou and besieged their capital. Dong&#x27;ou managed to send someone to appeal for help from the Han. Opinions at the Han court were mixed on whether or not to help Dong&#x27;ou. Grand commandant Tian Fen was of the opinion that the Yue constantly attacked each other and it was not in the Han&#x27;s interest to interfere in their affairs. Palace counsellor Zhuang Zhu argued that to not aid Dong&#x27;ou would be to signal the end of the empire just like the Qin. A compromise was made to allow Zhuang Zhu to call up troops, but only from Kuaiji Commandery, and finally an army was transported by sea to Dong&#x27;ou. By the time the Han forces had arrived, Minyue had already withdrawn its troops. The king of Dong&#x27;ou no longer wished to live in Dong&#x27;ou, so he requested permission for the inhabitants of his state to move into Han territory. Permission was granted and he and all his people settled in the region between the Yangtze and Huai River.

In 137, Minyue invaded Nanyue. An imperial army was sent against them, but the Minyue king was murdered by his brother Zou Yushan, who sued for peace with the Han. The Han enthroned Zou Wuzhu&#x27;s grandson, Zou Chou, as king. After they left, Zou Yushan secretly declared himself king while the Han backed Zou Chou found himself powerless. When the Han found out about this the emperor deemed it too troublesome to punish Yushan and let the matter slide.

In 112, Nanyue rebelled against the Han. Zou Yushan pretended to send forces to aid the Han against Nanyue, but secretly maintained contact with Nanyue and only took his forces as far as Jieyang. Han general Yang Pu wanted to attack Minyue for their betrayal; however, the emperor felt that their forces were already too exhausted for any further military action, so the army was disbanded. The next year, Zou Yushan learned that Yang Pu had requested permission to attack him and saw that Han forces were amassing at his border. Zou Yushan made a preemptive attack against the Han, taking Baisha, Wulin, and Meiling, killing three commanders. In the winter, the Han retaliated with a multi-pronged attack by Han Yue, Yang Pu, Wang Wenshu, and two Yue marquises. When Han Yue arrived at the Minyue capital, the Yue native Wu Yang rebelled against Zou Yushan and murdered him. Wu Yang was enfeoffed by the Han as marquis of Beishi. Emperor Wu of Han felt it was too much trouble to occupy Minyue as it was a region full of narrow mountain passes. He commanded the army to evict the region and resettle the people between the Yangtze and Huai River, leaving the region (modern Fujian) a deserted land.

===Lạc Việt===
Lạc Việt, known in Chinese history as Luoyue, was an ancient conglomeration of Yue tribes in what is now modern Guangxi and northern Vietnam. According to Vietnamese folklore and legend, the Lạc Việt founded a state called Văn Lang and were ruled by the Hùng kings, who were descended from Lạc Long Quân (Lạc Dragon Lord). Lạc Long Quân came from the sea and subdued all the evil of the land, taught the people how to cultivate rice and wear clothes, and then returned to the sea again. He then met and married Âu Cơ, a goddess, daughter of Đế Lai. Âu Cơ soon bore an egg sac, from which hatched a hundred children. The first born son became Hùng King and ancestor of Luoyue people.

Despite its legendary origins, Lạc Việt history only begins in the 7th century BC with the first Hùng king in Mê Linh uniting the various tribes.

In 208, the Western Ou (Xi&#x27;ou or Nam Cương) king Thục Phán, a descendant of Shu royalty, conquered Văn Lang.

===Âu Việt===

The Âu Việt, known in Chinese as Ouyue, resided in modern northeast Vietnam, Guangdong province, and Guangxi province. At some point they split and became the Western Ou and the Eastern Ou. In the late 3rd century BC, Thục Phán, a descendant of the last ruler of Shu, came to rule the Western Ou. In 219 BC, Western Ou came under attack from the Qin empire and lost its king. Seeking refuge, Thục Phán led a group of dispossessed Ou lords south in 208 BC and conquered the Lạc Việt state of Văn Lang, which he renamed Âu Lạc. Henceforth he came to be known as An Dương Vương.

An Dương Vương and the Ou lords built the citadel Cổ Loa, literally &#x27;Old snail&#x27;—so called because its walls were laid out in concentric rings reminiscent of a snail shell. According to legend, the construction of the citadel was halted by a group of spirits seeking to gain revenge for the son of the previous king. The spirits were led by a white chicken. A golden turtle appeared, subdued the white chicken, and protected An Dương Vương until the citadel&#x27;s completion. When the turtle departed, he left one of his claws behind, which An Dương Vương used as the trigger for his magical crossbow, the &quot;Saintly Crossbow of the Supernaturally Luminous Golden Claw&quot;.

An Dương Vương sent a giant called Lý Ông Trọng to the Qin dynasty as tribute. During his stay with the Qin, Lý Ông Trọng distinguished himself in fighting the Xiongnu, after which he returned to his native village and died there.

In 179 BC, An Dương Vương acknowledged the suzerainty of the Han dynasty, causing Zhao Tuo of Nanyue to become hostile and mobilize forces against Âu Lạc. Zhao Tuo&#x27;s initial attack was unsuccessful. According to legend, Zhao Tuo asked for a truce and sent his son to conduct a marriage alliance with An Dương Vương&#x27;s daughter. Zhao Tuo&#x27;s son stole the turtle claw that powered An Dương Vương&#x27;s magical crossbow, rendering his realm without protection. When Zhao Tuo invaded again, An Dương Vương fled into the sea where he was welcomed by the golden turtle. Âu Lạc was divided into the two prefectures of Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen.

===Nanyue===

Zhao Tuo was a Qin general originally born around 240 BC in the state of Zhao (within modern Hebei). When Zhao was annexed by Qin in 222 BC, Zhao Tuo joined the Qin and served as one of their generals in the conquest of the Baiyue. The territory of the Baiyue was divided into the three provinces of Guilin, Nanhai, and Xiang. Zhao served as magistrate in the province of Nanhai until his military commander, Ren Xiao, fell ill. Before he died, Ren advised Zhao not to get involved in the affairs of the declining Qin, and instead set up his own independent kingdom centered around the geographically remote and isolated city of Panyu (modern Guangzhou). Ren gave Zhao full authority to act as military commander of Nanhai and died shortly afterwards. Zhao immediately closed off the roads at Hengpu, Yangshan, and Huangqi. Using one excuse or another he eliminated the Qin officials and replaced them with his own appointees. By the time the Qin fell in 206 BC, Zhao had also conquered the provinces of Guilin and Xiang. He declared himself King Wu of Nanyue (Southern Yue). Unlike Qin Shi Huang, Zhao respected Yue customs, rallied their local rulers, and let local chieftains continue their old policies and local political traditions. Under Zhao&#x27;s rule, he encouraged Han Chinese settlers to intermarry with the indigenous Yue tribes through instituting a policy of &#x27;harmonizing and gathering&#x27; while creating a syncretic culture that was a blend of Han and Yue cultures.

In 196, Emperor Gaozu of Han dispatched Lu Jia to recognize Zhao Tuo as king of Nanyue. Lu gave Zhao a seal legitimizing him as king of Nanyue in return for his nominal submission to the Han. Zhao received him in the manner of the local people with his hair in a chignon while squatting. Lu accused him of going native and forgetting his true ancestry. Zhao excused himself by saying he had forgotten the northern customs after living in the south for so long.

In 185, Empress Lü&#x27;s officials outlawed trade of iron and horses with Nanyue. Zhao Tuo retaliated by proclaiming himself Emperor Wu of Nanyue and attacking the neighboring kingdom of Changsha, taking a few border towns. In 181 BC, Zhou Zao was dispatched by Empress Lü to attack Nanyue, but the heat and dampness caused many of his officers and men to fall ill, and he failed to make it across the mountains into enemy territory. Zhao began to menace the neighboring kingdoms of Minyue, Xiou (Western Ou), and Luoluo. After securing their submission he began passing out edicts in a similar manner to the Han emperor.

In 180, Emperor Wen of Han made efforts to appease Zhao. Learning that Zhao&#x27;s parents were buried in Zhending, he set aside a town close by just to take care of their graves. Zhao&#x27;s cousins were appointed to high offices at the Han court. He also withdrew the army stationed in Changsha on the Han-Nanyue border. In response, Zhao rescinded his claims to imperium while communicating with the Han, however he continued using the title of emperor within his kingdom. Tribute bearing envoys from Nanyue were sent to the Han and thus the iron trade was resumed.

In 179, Zhao Tuo defeated the kingdom of Âu Lạc and annexed it.

Zhao Tuo died in 137 and was succeeded by his grandson, Zhao Mo. Upon Zhao Mo&#x27;s accession, the neighboring king of Minyue, Zou Ying, sent his army to attack Nanyue. Zhao sent for help from the Han dynasty, his nominal vassal overlord. The Han responded by sending troops against Minyue, but before they could get there, Zou Ying was killed by his brother Zou Yushan, who surrendered to the Han. The Han army was recalled. Zhao considered visiting the Han court in order to show his gratitude. His high ministers argued against it, reminding him that his father kept his distance from the Han and merely avoided a breach of etiquette to keep the peace. Zhao therefore pleaded illness and never went through with the trip. Zhao did actually fall ill several years later and died in 122. He was succeeded by his son, Zhao Yingqi.

After the Han dynasty aided Nanyue in fending off an invasion by Minyue, Zhao Mo sent his son Yingqi to the Han court, where he joined the emperor&#x27;s guard. Zhao Yingqi married a Han Chinese woman from the Jiu family of Handan, who gave birth to his second son, Zhao Xing. Yingqi behaved without any scruples and committed murder on several occasions. When his father died in 122, he refused to visit the Han emperor to ask for his leave due to fearing that he would be arrested and punished for his behavior. Yingqi died in 115 and was succeeded by his second son, Zhao Xing, rather than the eldest, Zhao Jiande.

In 113, Emperor Wu of Han sent Anguo Shaoji to summon Zhao Xing and the Queen Dowager Jiu to Chang&#x27;an for an audience with the emperor. The Queen Dowager Jiu, who was Han Chinese, was regarded as a foreigner by the Yue people, and it was widely rumored that she had an illicit relationship with Anguo Shaoji before she married Zhao Yingqi. When Anguo arrived, quite a number of people believed the two resumed their relationship. The Queen Dowager feared that there would be a revolt against her authority so she urged the king and his ministers to seek closer ties to the Han. Xing agreed to and proposed that relations between Nanyue and the Han should be normalized with a triennial journey to the Han court as well as the removal of custom barriers along the border. The prime minister of Nanyue, Lü Jia, held military power and his family was more well connected than either the king or the Queen Dowager. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot;, Lü Jia was chief of a Lạc Việt tribe, related to King Qin of Cangwu by marriage, and over 70 of his kinsmen served as officials in various parts of the Nanyue court. Lü refused to meet the Han envoys which angered the Queen Dowager. She tried to kill him at a banquet but was stopped by Xing. The Queen Dowager tried to gather enough support at court to kill Lü in the following months, but her reputation prevented it. When news of the situation reached Emperor Wu in 112, he ordered Zhuang Can to lead a 2,000 men expedition to Nanyue. However, Zhuang refused to accept the mission, declaring that it was illogical to send so many men under the pretext of peace, but so few to enforce the might of the Han. The former prime minister of Jibei, Han Qianqiu, offered to lead the expedition and arrest Lü Jia. When Han crossed the Han–Nanyue border, Lü conducted a coup, killing Xing, Queen Dowager Jiu, and all the Han emissaries in the capital. Xing&#x27;s brother, Zhao Jiande, was declared the new king.

The 2000 men led by Han Qianqiu took several small towns but were defeated as they neared Panyu, which greatly shocked and angered Emperor Wu. The emperor then sent an army of 100,000 to attack Nanyue. The army marched on Panyu in a multi-pronged assault. Lu Bode advanced from the Hui River and Yang Pu from the Hengpu River. Three natives of Nanyue also joined the Han. One advanced from the Li River, the second invaded Cangwu, and the third advanced from the Zangke River. In the winter of 111 BC Yang Pu captured Xunxia and broke through the line at Shimen. With 20,000 men he drove back the vanguard of the Nanyue army and waited for Lu Bode. However, Lu failed to meet up on time and when he did arrive, he had no more than a thousand men. Yang reached Panyu first and attacked it at night, setting fire to the city. Panyu surrendered at dawn. Jiande and Lü Jia fled the city by boat, heading east to appeal for Minyue&#x27;s aid, but the Han learned of their escape and sent the general Sima Shuang after them. Both Jiande and Lü Jia were captured and executed.

===Dianyue===
In 135 BC, the Han envoy Tang Meng brought gifts to Duotong, the king of Yelang, which bordered the Dian Kingdom, and convinced him to submit to the Han. Jianwei Commandery was established in the region. In 122, Emperor Wu dispatched four groups of envoys to the southwest in search of a route to Daxia in Central Asia. One group was welcomed by the king of Dian but none of them were able to make it any further as they were blocked in the north by the Sui and Kunming tribes of the Erhai region and in the south by the Di and Zuo tribes. However, they learned that further west there was a kingdom called Dianyue where the people rode elephants and traded with the merchants from Shu in secret.

===Han dynasty===
In 111 BC, the Han conquered Nanyue and ruled it for the next several hundred years. The former territory of Nanyue was converted into nine commanderies and two outpost commands.

Nanyue was seen as attractive to the Han rulers as they desired to secure the area&#x27;s maritime trade routes and gain access to luxury goods from the south such as pearls, incense, elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns, tortoise shells, coral, parrots, kingfishers, peacocks, and other rare luxuries to satisfy the demands of the Han aristocracy. Other considerations such as frontier security, revenue from a relatively large agricultural population, and access to tropical commodities all contributed to the Han dynasty&#x27;s desire to retain control of the region. Panyu was already a major center for international maritime trade and was one of the most economically prosperous metropolises during the Han dynasty. Regions in the principal ports of modern Guangdong were used for the production of pearls and a trading terminal for maritime silk with Ancient India and the Roman Empire.

Sinicization of the southern Han dynasty which used to be Nanyue was the result of several factors. Northern and central China was often a theater of imperial dynastic conflict which resulted Han Chinese refugees fleeing to the south. With dynastic changes, wars, and foreign invasions, Han Chinese living in central China were forced to expand into the unfamiliar southern regions. As the number of Han Chinese immigrants into the Yue coastal regions increased, many Chinese families joined them to escape political unrest, military service, tax obligations, persecution, or sought new opportunities. As early arrivals took advantage of the easily accessible fertile land, latecomers had to continue migrating to more remote areas. Conflicts would sometimes arise between the two groups but eventually Han Chinese immigrants from the northern plains moved south to form ad hoc groups and take on the role as powerful local political leaders, many of whom accepted Chinese government titles. Each new wave of Han immigrants exerted additional pressure on the indigenous Yue inhabitants as the Han Chinese in southern China gradually became the predominant ethnic group in local life while displacing the Yue tribes into more mountainous and remote border areas.

The difficulty of logistics and the malarial climate in the south made Han migration and eventual sinicization of the region a slow process. Describing the contrast in immunity towards malaria between the indigenous Yue and the Chinese immigrants, Robert B. Marks (2017:145-146) writes:

Over the same period, the Han dynasty incorporated many other border peoples such as the Dian and assimilated them. Under the direct rule and greater efforts at sinification by the victorious Han, the territories of the Lac states were annexed and ruled directly, along with other former Yue territories to the north as provinces of the Han empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod 2001 https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof0000mcle/page/15 15-16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trưng Sisters====
In 40 AD, the Lạc lord Thi Sách rebelled on the advice of his wife Trưng Trắc. The administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery, Su Ding, was too afraid to confront them and fled. The commanderies of Jiuzhen, Hepu, and Rinan all rebelled. Trưng Trắc abolished the Han taxes and was recognized as queen at Mê Linh. Later Vietnamese sources would claim that her husband was killed by the Han, thus stirring her to action, but Chinese sources make it clear Trưng Trắc was always in the leading position, alongside her sister Trưng Nhị. Together they came to be known as the legendary Trưng Sisters of Vietnamese history. A large number of names and biographies of leaders under the Trưng Sisters are recorded in temples dedicated to them, many of them also women.

In 42 AD, the veteran Han general Ma Yuan led 20,000 troops against the Trưng Sisters. His advance was checked by Cổ Loa Citadel for over a year, but the Lạc lords became increasingly nervous at the sight of a large Han army. Realizing that she would soon lose her followers if she did not do anything, Trưng Trắc sallied out against the Han army and lost badly, losing more than 10,000 followers. Her followers fled, allowing Ma Yuan to advance. By early 43 AD, both sisters had been captured and executed.

====Post-rebellion sinicisation====

After the rebellion of the Trưng Sisters, more direct rule and greater efforts at sinicisation were imposed by the Han dynasty. The territories of the Lạc lords were revoked and ruled directly, along with other former Yue territories to the north, as provinces of the Han empire. Division among the Yue leaders were exploited by the Han dynasty with the Han military winning battles against the southern kingdoms and commanderies that were of geographic and strategic value to them. Han foreign policy also took advantage of the political turmoil among rival Yue leaders and enticed them with bribes and lured prospects for submitting to the Han Empire as a subordinate vassal.

Continuing internal Han Chinese migration during the Han dynasty eventually brought all the Yue coastal peoples under Chinese political control and cultural influence. As the number of Han Chinese migrants intensified following the annexation of Nanyue, the Yue people were gradually absorbed and driven out into poorer land on the hills and into the mountains. Chinese military garrisons showed little patience with the Yue tribes who refused to submit to Han Chinese imperial power and resisted the influx of Han Chinese immigrants, driving them out to the coastal extremities such as the river valleys and highland areas where they became marginal scavengers and outcasts. Han dynasty rulers saw the opportunity offered by the Chinese family agricultural settlements and used it as a tool for colonizing newly conquered regions and transforming those environments. Displaced Yue tribes often staged sneak attacks and small-scale raids or attacks to reclaim their lost territories on Chinese settlements termed &quot;rebellions&quot; by traditional historians but were eventually stymied by the strong action of the Han dynasty&#x27;s military superiority.

====Shanyue====
The Shanyue &quot;Mountain Yue&quot; were one of the last groups of Yue mentioned in Chinese history. They lived in the mountain regions of modern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Fujian.

Yan Baihu, or &quot;White Tiger Yan&quot;, was a bandit leader of possibly Shanyue origins. When Sun Ce came to Wu Commandery in 195, Yan Baihu gave refuge to the displaced Xu Gong and threatened the flank of Sun Ce&#x27;s army. However, Sun Ce paid him no attention and the two avoided any altercations. In 197, Cao Cao&#x27;s agent Chen Yu provoked Yan into rebellion. Sun Ce sent Lü Fan to drive out Chen Yu while he himself attacked Yan. The defeated Yan fled south to join Xu Zhao but died soon afterwards. Remnants of Yan&#x27;s band joined Xu Gong in 200 to threaten Sun Ce&#x27;s rear as he attacked Huang Zu in the west. Sun Ce decided to retreat and finish off the bandits once and for all, only to fall into an ambush and die at their hands.

In 203, they rebelled against Sun Quan&#x27;s rule and were defeated by the generals Lü Fan, Cheng Pu, and Taishi Ci. In 217, Sun Quan appointed Lu Xun supreme commander of an army to suppress martial activities by the Shanyue in Guiji (modern Shaoxing). Captured Shanyue tribesmen were recruited into the army. In 234, Zhuge Ke was made governor of Danyang. Under his governorship, the region was cleansed of the Shanyue through systematic destruction of their settlements. Captured tribesmen were used as front line fodder in the army. The remaining population was resettled in lowlands and many became tenant farmers for Chinese landowners.

===Post-Han===
The fall of the Han dynasty and the following period of division sped up the process of sinicisation. Periods of instability and war in northern and central China, such as the Northern and Southern dynasties and during the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty sent waves of Han Chinese into the south. 
Waves of migration and subsequent intermarriage and cross-cultural dialogue gave rise to modern Chinese demographics with a dominant Han Chinese majority and minority non-Han Chinese indigenous peoples in the south. By the Tang dynasty (618–907), the term &quot;Yue&quot; had largely become a regional designation rather than a cultural one, as in the Wuyue state during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in what is now Zhejiang province. During the Song dynasty, a bridge known as the Guojie qiao (World Crossing Bridge) was built at Jiaxing between the modern border of Jiangsu province and Zhejiang province. On the northern side of the bridge stands a statue of King Fuchai of Wu and on the southern side, a statue of King Goujian of Yue. Successive waves of migration in different localities during various times in Chinese history over the past two thousand years have given rise to different dialect groups seen in Southern China today. Modern Lingnan culture contains both Nanyue and Han Chinese elements: the modern Cantonese language resembles Middle Chinese (the prestige language of the Tang dynasty), but has retained some features of the long-extinct Nanyue language. Some distinctive features of the vocabulary, phonology, and syntax of southern varieties of Chinese are attributed to substrate languages that were spoken by the Yue. There is also evidence that southern Han culture adopted Baiyue customs, including their maritime practices, superstitions and worship of water goddesses.

==Legacy==
In ancient China, the characters and (both in pinyin and in Jyutping) were used interchangeably, but they are differentiated in modern Chinese:

* The character refers to the original territory of the state of Yue, which was based in what is now northern Zhejiang, especially the areas around Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is also used to write Vietnam, a word adapted from &quot;Nanyue&quot; (), (literal English translation as &quot;Southern Yue&quot;). This character is also still used in the city Guangzhou for the Yuexiu () district, and when referring to the Nanyue Kingdom.
* The character is associated with the southern province of Guangdong. Both the regional dialects of Yue Chinese and the standard form, popularly called Cantonese, are spoken in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and in many Cantonese communities around the world.

===Vietnam===
 is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of Yue, derived from Middle Chinese. The modern name of Vietnam derives from Nanyue, or Nam Việt, except reversed.

===Tanka people===
== Genetics ==
A 2018 study states that Baiyue shared common ancestral origins with ethnic groups like the Bidayuh, sharing 60% similarity in their mtDNA. The Austronesian ancestry of Baiyue might also explain their genetic prediposition to nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

A 2022 study states that the genetic characteristics of the &quot;Bai-Yue&quot; lineage &quot;is well preserved in present-day Tai-Kadai speakers residing in South China and North Vietnam&quot;. But these populations were significantly admixed with other populations, such as Han Chinese, except for Li people, who are enriched with ~85% Baiyue ancestry. The latter separated themselves from other Baiyue peoples and migrated to Hainan Island, where they preserved their Baiyue ancestry due to geographic isolation. This occurred about 4000 to 3000 years ago. The Li people also shared stronger genetic connections with Austronesians that harbored more divergent ancestry, such as the Ami, Atayal, and Kankanaey. However, there is evidence of admixture between Li and Han Chinese about 2000 years ago, with Li having about 56.56% Han ancestry as a result. 

Other studies, however, found that most Kra-Dai-speaking populations in China and Vietnam share connections with the Atayal, with the former harboring about ~3–38% Atayal-related ancestry. 

==Culture==
The Han referred to the various non-Han &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples of southern China as &quot;Baiyue&quot;, saying they possessed habits like adapting to water, having their hair cropped short and tattooed. The Han also said their language was &quot;animal shrieking&quot; and that they lacked morals, modesty, civilization and culture. According to one Han Chinese immigrant of the 2nd century BC, &quot;The Yue cut their hair short, tattooed their body, live in bamboo groves with neither towns nor villages, possessing neither bows or arrows, nor horses or chariots.&quot; They also blackened their teeth.

Militarily, the ancient states of Yue and Wu were distinct from other Sinitic states for their possession of a navy. Unlike other Chinese states of the time, they also named their boats and swords. A Chinese text described the Yue as a people who used boats as their carriages and oars as their horses. The marshy lands of the south gave the Gouwu and Yuyue people unique characteristics. According to Robert Marks, the Yue lived in what is now Fujian province gained their livelihood mostly from fishing, hunting, and practiced some kind of swidden rice farming. Prior to Han Chinese migration from the north, the Yue tribes cultivated wet rice, practiced fishing and slash-and-burn agriculture, domesticated water buffalo, built stilt houses, tattooed their faces and dominated the coastal regions from shores all the way to the fertile valleys in the interior mountains. Water transport was paramount in the south, so the two states became advanced in shipbuilding and developed maritime warfare technology mapping trade routes to Eastern coasts of China and Southeast Asia.

===Swords===

The Yue were known for their swordsmanship and producing fine double-edged swords (). &quot;Kao Gong Ji&quot; stated that Wu and Yue manufactured the best double-edged swords. According to the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue&quot;, King Goujian met a female sword fighter called Nanlin (Yuenü) who demonstrated mastery over the art, and so he commanded his top five commanders to study her technique. Ever since, the technique came to be known as the &quot;Sword of the Lady of Yue&quot;. The Yue were also known for their possession of mystical knives embued with the talismanic power of dragons or other amphibious creatures.

The &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; mentions the high quality of southern swords and their ability to cleave through oxen, horses, bowls, and basins, but would shatter if used on a pillar or rock. Wu and Yue swords were highly valued and those who owned them would hardly ever use them for fear of damage, however in Wu and Yue these swords were commonplace and treated with less reverence. The &quot;Yuejue shu&quot; (Record of Precious Swords) mentions several named swords: Zhanlu (Black), Haocao (Bravery), Juque (Great Destroyer), Lutan (Dew Platform), Chunjun (Purity), Shengxie (Victor over Evil), Yuchang (Fish-belly), Longyuan (Dragon Gulf), Taie (Great Riverbank), and Gongbu (Artisanal Display). Many of these were made by the Yue swordsmith Ou Yezi.

Even after Wu and Yue were assimilated into larger Chinese polities, memory of their swords lived on. During the Han dynasty, Liu Pi King of Wu (195–154 BC) had a sword named Wujian to honour the history of metalworking in his kingdom.

==Language==

Knowledge of Yue speech is limited to fragmentary references and possible loanwords in other languages, principally Chinese. The longest is the &quot;Song of the Yue Boatman&quot;, a short song transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC and included, with a Chinese version, in the &quot;Garden of Stories&quot; compiled by Liu Xiang five centuries later.

<text>Chetham&#x27;s School of Music () is a private co-educational boarding and day music school in Manchester, England. Chetham&#x27;s educates pupils between the ages of 8 and 18, all of whom enter via musical auditions.

The music school was established in 1969 from Chetham&#x27;s Hospital School, founded as a charity school by Humphrey Chetham in 1653. After becoming a boys&#x27; grammar school in 1952, the school turned to music as its speciality, at the same time becoming a private school and accepting its first female students. There are approximately 300 students on roll, including a large sixth form making up around half of the school. Approximately two-thirds of students board on site, with others travelling in as day students from around Greater Manchester. The oldest parts of the school date to the 1420s, when the building was constructed as a residence for priests of the church which is now Manchester Cathedral. These parts are listed buildings housing Chetham&#x27;s Library.

Academic and music teaching moved into a new, building in 2012; this replaced the Victorian Palatine building and allowed easier access for concert visitors. A 482-seat concert hall, Stoller Hall, opened within the New School Building in 2017.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The school is built on the site of Manchester Castle, a fortified manor house owned by the Grelleys after the Norman Conquest, at the confluence of the River Irwell and the River Irk. Medieval Manchester grew around the manor house and the parish church, which eventually became Manchester Cathedral.

In the early 14th century, the de la Warre family acquired the land through marriage. Thomas de la Warre refounded the church as a collegiate church in 1421. De la Warre gave the site of his manor house for the construction of a college, where eight priests, four clerks and six lay choristers lived in the care of a warden. It is likely that building began between 1424 and 1429, and the main hall and cloister rooms finished by 1458. It remains the most complete building of its kind in the country, and at the time of its construction, was the second largest building in Manchester, surpassed only by the church.

The college was dissolved during the English Reformation in 1547, and purchased by Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. It was re-founded by Queen Mary, before Elizabeth I refounded it as &#x27;Christ&#x27;s College&#x27; in 1578. This arrangement lasted until the foundation of Manchester Cathedral in 1847. The college buildings remained the property of the Stanleys, and wardens (including the Elizabethan astronomer and mathematician John Dee) lived on the premises with their families and servants. During the English Civil War, the college was used as a gunpowder factory and a prison and was left damaged by powder, disused and overrun by pigs. Lord James Stanley, a Royalist, was executed in 1651, and Parliament confiscated his property, including the college.

===Humphrey Chetham===
Humphrey Chetham was an unmarried and childless financier, philanthropist and cloth merchant from Manchester. In the 1640s he provided money for the maintenance and education of fourteen poor boys from Manchester, six from Salford, and two from Droylsden. In March 1649 he wrote to the Earl of Derby about his intention to establish a school. He attempted unsuccessfully to acquire the buildings, which were &quot;spoyld and ruin&#x27;d and become like a dunghill&quot;, to provide a hospital, school and library. In his will, Chetham left over £8,000 from his estate (which was worth about £14,000 in total) to establish a hospital school for 40 poor local boys, between the ages of six and ten and from &quot;honest&quot; families, who should be taught and cared for until they were 14. His executors obtained the lease of the college in 1654 to house both the school and library.

===Charity school===
After repairs to the college were completed in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all boys had to be able to read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham&#x27;s, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.

===World War II and aftermath: 1939 to 1952===
During World War II, the boys were evacuated to the seaside town of Cleveleys, Lancashire, where they shared accommodation with a primary school. Chetham&#x27;s was damaged by an explosion in December 1940, when most of the windows were shattered and the roof set alight. The boys relocated to Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, in 1943, although thirteen boys attending grammar school moved to Buxton College. By 1944 the governors believed that it would not be appropriate for the school to return to Manchester, and it was proposed the site become a religious education centre. However, after years of discussion, it was decided to return the school to Manchester. The Education Act 1944, which stipulated that schools should be classified as primary or secondary, complicated matters, since Chetham&#x27;s went across the middle. It was decided in 1950 that Chetham&#x27;s should become a grammar school, and this change took place two years later. In 1950, Chetham&#x27;s amalgamated with Nicholls&#x27; Hospital School, a similar school based in Ardwick which had been established in 1863. While it could take up to 100 boys, by the end of the war there were only 22 and it was considered beneficial for the schools to merge.

===Later history: since 1952===

After the change in organisation, Chetham&#x27;s could no longer afford to provide education based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, it is currently known as the Nicholls Building and opened in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.

Before becoming a specialist school, Chetham&#x27;s had a good reputation for music, and on this basis the decision was made to become a co-educational music school in 1969. The former Palatine Hotel, which housed offices and shops, was converted into extra teaching space and practice rooms. In 1969, 50 students were admitted based on musical potential and by 1972 this had risen to 150, more than half of the entire school. In 1977 the school changed to its present name. In 1978 the Long Millgate building, the original home of Manchester Grammar School, was purchased to provide additional space to the campus. Also included with the building was The Whiteley Hall, a 200-seat central performance space which became the primary venue of Chetham&#x27;s concerts until 2017.

New College House, a boarding house for girls at Chetham&#x27;s, was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994. The boarding capacity at the school was further increased following an extension to the Nicholls Building in 2004. In 2012, a new school building adjacent to the existing site, purpose-designed for music teaching, was opened by the Earl of Wessex (Patron of the school). This included The Carole Nash Hall, a 100-seat recital hall, and space for a 400-seat concert hall, which would later open in 2017 as The Stoller Hall. The Long Millgate building continues to be used as a boarding house for students, as well as a dining space, a school gym and currently houses the school&#x27;s art department. The Palatine Building was demolished in 2016 to reveal the previously hidden medieval buildings and allow easier access to the library.

In June 2021, a fire broke out within the Long Millgate building, beginning at approximately 2.20am within The Whiteley Hall. The adjacent student boarding houses, Millgate House and Victoria House, were reported to have been successfully evacuated with no harm caused to either the students or staff. Fire crews reportedly arrived immediately on the scene and contained the blaze, however the incident caused substantial damage to The Whiteley Hall itself, including the main stage and a pipe organ originally installed in 2002. The school gym on the lower levels also suffered water damage.

===Historical abuse allegations and convictions (2013 onwards)===
In February 2013, Michael Brewer, Director of Music from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, and his ex-wife, were convicted of indecently assaulting a pupil, Frances Andrade, between 1978 and 1982. Andrade committed suicide after giving evidence at their trial. Prosecutors claimed Brewer was forced to resign in the 1990s after an inappropriate relationship with a 16-year-old girl. The school&#x27;s statement said the current staff were &quot;shocked ... to the core&quot; by the revelations of &quot;the most appalling acts which took place during his time at the school ...&quot; In March 2013, Brewer was found guilty of indecent assault and sentenced to six years imprisonment.

It was reported that allegations of assault were made against another teacher in the 1980s. On 12 February, Malcolm Layfield, Head of Strings at the Royal Northern College of Music resigned from the RNCM Board after claims of his previous sexual misconduct were brought up during the Brewer hearing. Before his appointment at RNCM, Layfield had admitted to having relationships with six Chetham&#x27;s pupils aged between 16 and 18 whilst he taught there. Two RNCM teachers, including the Head of Keyboard Studies, Martin Roscoe, resigned in protest at his appointment in 2002. In October 2013 Layfield was arrested on suspicion of raping and indecently assaulting an 18-year-old woman between 1988 and 1999, but was found not guilty at a trial in 2015.

On 14 February 2013, Wen Zhou Li, a violin teacher at the Royal Northern College of Music and former teacher at Chetham&#x27;s, was arrested on charges of rape that allegedly occurred whilst he taught at the school. The case was dropped in 2016 before coming to trial, and Wen Zhou Li was told that he left court &quot;without a stain on his character&quot;. Allegations of sexual abuse were also made against the pianist Ryszard Bakst, who died in 1999, and former violin teacher Christopher Ling. Ling, who had moved to Los Angeles in the 1990s, shot himself at his home when US marshals arrived in September 2015 with a provisional arrest warrant.

On 8 May 2013, the Greater Manchester Police reported that over 30 women had reported incidents of abuse relating to the school. The investigation into allegations of abuse made against individuals said by police to &quot;have or have had connections with either Chetham&#x27;s and/or Royal Northern College of Music and/or have taught music privately&quot;, was known as Operation Kiso. Thirty-nine individuals were named and 10 of these proactively investigated; the school stated that it was assisting the police with their inquiries, and had instigated an action plan to review their safeguarding processes and procedures. In 2013, two independent reports found that school &quot;failed to follow its own guidelines to keep children safe. They also discovered that no formal, minuted meetings had taken place at the school to discuss the recent allegations and consider changes to its child protection policy.&quot;

Between September and October 2019, Chetham’s School of Music gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, after applying as a core participant along with four other residential music schools. In a statement from Chetham&#x27;s, Alun Jones, the principal in 2019 commented, “I welcome this Inquiry. Victims and survivors of child sexual abuse need to know that they are being listened to and that changes happen as a result of what they say. As Principal of Chetham’s I have a duty of care to our current and future students to make sure we also do everything possible to learn from victims and survivors’ experiences.”

In March 2022, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse delivered its preliminary findings, which included damning statements about the conduct of senior staff at Chetham&#x27;s School of Music, criticising a cultural reluctance to report serious safeguarding concerns, also seen across other participating schools within the inquiry. One such statement from the report read, &quot;On occasion, when allegations of child sexual abuse arose, headteachers moved to protect the reputation of the school rather than the welfare of victims and other children at the school.&quot;. It concluded that the power and influence of its eminent music teachers at the time further compromised its pupils.

In October 2022, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse made 20 recommendations within its final report. In a statement, Chetham&#x27;s School of Music said, &quot;To the victims and survivors of abuse including their families and loved ones, we are truly sorry [...] [This] report confirms above all else that there is no room for complacency. As the report says ‘child sexual abuse is not a problem consigned to the past&#x27;. These mistakes must never be repeated, here or elsewhere. We therefore welcome all 20 recommendations in the report. [...] “None of this work can undo past failures, and our apologies will never be enough, but we will do everything in our power to ensure that young people across the UK today are safe and protected.”

==Academics and pastoral care==
===Admissions===
Students are admitted to the school on musical ability and talent. Funding for up to 100% of study and boarding fees is available to most students through the UK Government&#x27;s Music and Dance Scheme.

===Curriculum===
As a specialist music school, Chetham&#x27;s requires all students to study a curriculum that concentrates on music and other subjects in accordance with the National Curriculum. Students taking GCSEs and A-levels study music. All students study at least two instruments and choir practice is compulsory.

Ensembles form an important part of the musical curriculum, with all students taking part in at least one. The ensembles include Chetham&#x27;s Symphony Orchestra, which has performed on BBC Radio 3. The award-winning Big Band played an integral part in the creation of a Jazz Studies programme, and has won many prizes, including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Young Jazz Competition, and the junior section of the BBC Radio 2 Big Band of the Year Competition three times. The Chamber Choir has performed on Songs of Praise and the BBC Proms and the Symphonic Wind Band and Orchestra have won prizes at the Boosey and Hawkes National Concert Festival.

===School life===
Chetham&#x27;s admits boarding and day students to one of three houses: Victoria House, a mixed-gender house for students aged 8–13; Millgate House, for boys aged 13–18; and New College House aged 13–18. In senior houses, boarding students usually share rooms for four people, and in the sixth form students either have single rooms or share with one other person. Students have a personal tutor to discuss their progress, and boarding students have a house parent who communicates with parents at home.

==Campus==

Chetham&#x27;s is situated in Manchester City Centre, close to Manchester Victoria railway station, The National Football Museum and Manchester Cathedral. There are several buildings on the site, many of which are listed. They surround a large open space, the north part is a car park and courtyard, and the south part is a playground.

===College House===
College House, the original 15th-century college, is a Grade I listed building built of sandstone in the shape of a lowercase &#x27;b&#x27; with a slate roof. It is accessed by the original gatehouse; which was constructed on a plinth and contains the original timbers. The upper storey is accessed by an external staircase. Baronial Hall, once the Great Hall, contains many of its original features, such as its timber roof, dais and canopy. There is a large fireplace dating from the 19th century, and three windows likely to date from the 16th century. The Audit Room, originally a common room, contains a panelled ceiling with decorations suggesting it was installed by the Stanley family. The upper room, originally the warden&#x27;s chamber, is now the library reading room, and contains a large bay window within an elaborate Tudor arch, as well as original 17th-century doors. The west part of the building surrounding the cloister courtyard contained accommodation known as sets, for people who lived in college. There were two rooms in each set on two floors, the lower floor being used as a study. Historian Clare Hartwell, describes the cobbled courtyard which has a restored well as &quot;one of the most atmospheric spaces in the building&quot;. It is surrounded by many windows, which were probably originally unglazed. Inside there are several corridors and passages containing open beams and original stonework. To the east is the kitchen and associated rooms, and further east are rooms used for administration offices, most of which have been substantially altered.

===New School Building===
Constructed in 2012 opposite Manchester Victoria Station and connected by a bespoke link bridge to the original site at Chetham&#x27;s, the New School Building contains most academic teaching rooms and all music teaching rooms across seven floors, as well as two performance spaces. The Carole Nash Hall is used regularly for recitals and masterclasses, including free Lunchtime Concerts which take place five times each week during the school term. Its primary concert space, The Stoller Hall, was opened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex in 2017 and houses larger scale performances for audiences of up to 500. It was named after its chief benefactor Sir Norman Stoller, founder of The Stoller Charitable Trust.

===Other buildings===
The Millgate Building, the former site of Manchester Grammar School, is a Grade II listed building designed by Alfred Waterhouse in the 1870s. Attached to it is the Nicholls Building, which was originally built in 1955. Combined, they are known as The Long Millgate Buildings, which contain The Whiteley Hall, school gym, school kitchen and dining room, art department, and two student boarding houses. Following the opening of the New School Building in 2012, many of the old classrooms inside were repurposed and refurbished as student accommodation. A top-down extension of the Nicholls Building was completed in 2004, allowing for the construction of these additional boarding facilities. Originally purposed as sixth form accommodation, the Nicholls Building now only contains Victoria House for junior boarders.

The Waterhouse Building (formerly known as The Vallins Arts Centre) is another building on the site designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1878. Waterhouse is Grade II listed and styled as a medieval chapel, it contains both upper and lower floor spaces often used as overflow classrooms and large ensemble rooms. Waterhouse was responsible for much of the alterations made to College House in the 19th century, and so the building was renamed in recognition of this. It formerly housed the school&#x27;s drama department until the late 2010&#x27;s, when the department was relocated to the lower levels of College House. It has been speculated that this building could eventually be repurposed as a future visitors centre for the adjacent Chetham&#x27;s Library.

New College House is the third boarding house and was opened by HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1994. Located adjacent to what is now Urbis and Cathedral Gardens, it was originally purpose-built as the Girls&#x27; House. It now houses both middle and sixth form students, complete with its own sixth form common room.

A small section of the former Palatine Building (demolished in 2016) also remains at the disused entrance gates adjacent to Manchester Cathedral and The Glade of Light Memorial. This section remains due to Grade I restrictions in relation to the medieval outer walls at Chetham&#x27;s.
