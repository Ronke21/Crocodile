<doc id="474978" wikidata="Q372968" url="?curid=474978" title="Robbie (short story)">
<text>&quot;Robbie&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was the first of Asimov&#x27;s positronic robot stories. In 2016, &quot;&#x27;Robbie&quot; won a retrospective 1941 Hugo Award for best short story. &quot;Robbie&quot; was the fourteenth story written by Asimov, and the ninth to be published. It was the first story in Asimov&#x27;s Robot series.

==Significance==
Central to the story is the technophobia that surrounds robots, and how it is misplaced. Almost all previously published science fiction stories featuring robots had followed the theme of robot turning against their creator, in common with the monster featured in Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Asimov has consistently held the belief that the Frankenstein complex was a misplaced fear. The majority of Asimov&#x27;s works concerning robots attempted to provide examples of the help that they could render for humanity.

==History==
Asimov began writing the story on June 10, 1939. He was inspired to write a story about a sympathetic robot by the story &quot;I, Robot&quot; by Otto Binder, which had recently been published in the January 1939 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

After John W. Campbell of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; rejected the story in June, Asimov briefly hired Frederik Pohl as literary agent, but he could not find a magazine to accept it. Pohl then became editor of &quot;Astonishing Stories&quot; and &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; in October 1939. In March 1940 Pohl purchased &quot;Robbie&quot; for the latter magazine. For its first publication, Pohl renamed the story “Strange Playfellow,” a title Asimov thought &quot;distasteful&quot;.

When the story was reprinted in the first collection of Asimov&#x27;s robot stories, &quot;I, Robot&quot; (a title Asimov had not wanted), he had his preferred title of &quot;Robbie&quot; restored. The reprint contained a number of revisions to the text. &quot;Robbie&quot; was later reprinted in &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990).The story was the first of Asimov&#x27;s positronic robot stories to see publication.

==Plot summary==
===Synopsis of 1940 version===
In the year 1982, a mute robot, nicknamed Robbie, is owned by the Weston family. He serves as a nursemaid for their daughter, Gloria. 

Mrs. Weston has become concerned about the effect a robot nursemaid might have on developing social skills and worries that he might malfunction and harm her. Gloria prefers Robbie&#x27;s company to that of other children. Mr. Weston gives in to his wife&#x27;s badgering and returns Robbie to the factory. Gloria&#x27;s parents claim that Robbie had, for no reason, &quot;walked away&quot;. They have replaced him with a collie dog called Lightning. 

The effort fails. Gloria, missing her best friend, stops enjoying life. Her mother thinks it would be impossible for Gloria to forget Robbie while surrounded by the places where they once played. Mrs. Weston convinces her husband to take them to New York City, where he happens to work. Gloria, getting the wrong idea, optimistically thinks that they are going to the city in search of Robbie.

Among other tourist attractions, the Westons visit the Museum of Science and Industry; Gloria sneaks away to see a &quot;Talking Robot&quot; (in modern terms, a computer), an immobile machine which takes up the whole room. It can answer questions posed to it verbally by visitors. Gloria asks the machine if it has seen Robbie, &quot;a robot... just like you.&quot; The computer, unable to comprehend the question, breaks down.

Mr. Weston approaches his wife with the idea of touring a robot factory. Gloria can then see robots as inanimate objects, not &quot;people&quot;. During the tour, Mr. Weston asks to see a room where robots make other robots. One of the robot assemblers is Robbie. Gloria runs in front of a moving vehicle in her eagerness to get to her friend, but is rescued by Robbie. Mrs. Weston confronts her husband: he had set up the encounter all along. When Robbie saves Gloria&#x27;s life, an unplanned part of the reunion, Mrs. Weston relents. The two friends can stay together.

===1950 revision===
The revised version changes the date to 1998 and adds a cameo appearance by Susan Calvin, at that time a college student studying robots, during the Talking Robot scene. Other changes include:
* Ret-con mention of the First Law of Robotics, absent in the original, which instead had an explanation by Mr Weston: “A robot is infinitely more to be trusted than a human nurse-maid. Robbie was constructed for only one purpose—to be the companion of a little child. His entire ‘mentality’ has been created for the purpose. He just can’t help being faithful and loving and kind. He’s a machine—&quot;made so.&quot;” 
* Robbie&#x27;s upper appendages are described as hands rather than tentacles.
* The Douglas expedition to the Moon is changed to the Lefebre-Yoshida expedition to Mars.
* Mrs. Weston (and the text) refers to the dog as &quot;it&quot;, rather than &quot;he&quot;. 
* The Finmark Robot Corporation is renamed to U.S. Robots.
* More details are added on the description of the visivox Gloria has seen with her family. 
* The reference to Mr. Weston commuting to New York via his private auto-gyro is removed.
* The reference to the effects on Mr Weston&#x27;s heirloom watch of the powerful electro-magnet is deleted.
* Additional description related to the Talking Robot and its capacities.
* Various sociological comments, such as &quot;[t]here&#x27;s bad feeling in the village&quot; and a reference to unions and dislocation (replacing a reference to Mr. Struthers&#x27; speech on &quot;Robots and the Future of the Human Being&quot;), are interpolated. A reference to a law restricting robots on public streets is moved.
* Mrs. Weston&#x27;s justification for her conclusion that Mr. Weston engineered the reunion, starting with &quot;Robbie wasn&#x27;t designed for engineering or construction work,&quot; is interpolated.

==Adaptations==
The story was broadcast as episode one of a five-part &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; radio adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in February 2017.

==Reception==
Groff Conklin called the story &quot;completely charming&quot;.

Apart from winning the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for the Best Short Story, &quot;Robbie&quot; was voted 29th in the 2012 Locus Poll of Best 20th Century Short Stories.

<doc id="474981" wikidata="Q750460" url="?curid=474981" title="Jet (band)">
<text>Jet are an Australian rock band formed in 2001. Founding mainstays are brothers Nic (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano) and Chris Cester (drums, vocals) together with Cameron Muncey (lead guitar and vocals). They were joined in the following year by Mark Wilson (bass guitar). The quartet released three studio albums &quot;Get Born&quot; (2003), &quot;Shine On&quot; (2006) and &quot;Shaka Rock&quot; (2009) before disbanding in 2012. &quot;Get Born&quot; is their highest charting work, which peaked at number one in Australia, top 20 in the United Kingdom and top 30 in the United States. Its lead single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; (2003) reached the top 20 in Australia and UK and top 30 in the US. Both &quot;Shine On&quot; and &quot;Shaka Rock&quot; are Australian top five albums, while their other top 20 singles are &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot; (2004), &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot; (2006) and &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot; (2009).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they headed the leader board with six wins: Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Get Born&quot; as well as Single of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;. At the APRA Awards that single won Most Performed Australian Work Overseas in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Jet reformed in 2016 but released no new studio albums and separated again in 2019. They reunited for a second time in 2023 and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in November that year.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Dirty Sweet&quot; (2001–2003)===

The Cester brothers, Nic and Chris, grew up in Dingley Village and attended St Bede&#x27;s College, Mentone, Melbourne. They listened to their father John&#x27;s classic rock records from the 1960s and 1970s. While still at school Nic formed a group by 1995, which Cameron Muncey joined. Jet&#x27;s influences include the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Faces, AC/DC and T. Rex. According to Nic, Australian power pop band You Am I had the biggest influence on their developing musical tastes:

Nic, on lead vocals and guitar, decided to form a garage rock band, in 2001, with Muncey on lead guitar and vocals, before Chris joined on drums and vocals. Bass guitarist Doug Armstrong, who completed the line-up, had met the Cesters while working at their father&#x27;s spice factory. The quartet trialled various band names, Mojo Filter, Hi-Fidelity and Duosonic, before settling for Jet in 2002 – from the song of the same name (originally by Paul McCartney and Wings). Their early repertoire was cover versions of You Am I songs and &quot;whatever else was going &#x27;round.&quot; &quot;Radio Song&quot; from their debut album &quot;Get Born&quot; was written about difficulties they had obtaining recognition at that time.

Jet supported Melbourne punk rock band the Specimens as an opening act at The Duke of Windsor hotel, Windsor. Talent manager and booking agent Dave Powell was filling-in for the venue&#x27;s sound engineer, &quot;I realised the singer could actually sing. I was blown away. They had a lot of potential and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of bands coming through who were like that.&quot; Powell signed the then-unnamed group to his management firm. Nic recalled, &quot;Duke of Windsor became our headquarters. [Powell] would be taking calls from you know, executives in Los Angeles from the keg room you know, that was his office.&quot; The members had met Mark Wilson in 2002 during his performance at that same venue and asked him to replace Armstrong on bass guitar. Wilson had been in a Geelong-based band, the Ca$inos.

Late in 2002 Jet independently issued a four-track debut extended play &quot;Dirty Sweet&quot;, with distribution by Rubber Records. Its initial pressing of 1000 copies was sold out. An &quot;NME&quot; writer had obtained a copy of the group&#x27;s single &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; from &quot;Dirty Sweet&quot; and described it as a mixture of the Rolling Stones and AC/DC. Elektra Records executives signed the band for a recording contract and re-released &quot;Dirty Sweet&quot; in May 2003.

===&quot;Get Born&quot; (2003–2005)===
Jet entered the Sunset Sound Studios, Los Angeles with Dave Sardy producing their debut album &quot;Get Born&quot; (September 2003). Sardy had produced work for Marilyn Manson and the Dandy Warhols. The Australian quartet used Billy Preston on keyboards for two tracks. &quot;Get Born&quot;″s title references a lyric from Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; (1965) &quot;Ah get born, keep warm.&quot; It reached number one in Australia and was accredited 8× platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). It peaked in the top 20 in the UK and top 30 in the US, and was certified platinum in both countries by British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), respectively.

The Rolling Stones offered Jet a support slot on the Australian leg of their 2003 tour. Including their own headlining tours, the Australian group played more than 200 shows during that 2003. &quot;Get Born&quot;″s singles &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; and &quot;Rollover DJ&quot; were listed at number one and number nineteen, respectively, on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003. &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; appeared on the soundtracks for the video games &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot;, &quot;Rock Band&quot;, and &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;; the 2006 animated film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;; the live-action films &quot;Eurotrip&quot; and &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot;; and as part of two major worldwide advertising campaigns for Vodafone and Apple&#x27;s iPod and iMac.

&quot;Rollover DJ&quot; is used on the soundtrack of PlayStation 2 game &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. &quot;Get Born&quot; also includes the song &quot;Timothy&quot;, dedicated to Muncey&#x27;s deceased brother – due to its sensitive nature the quartet rarely play the track live. In early 2004, Jet teamed up with the Vines and the Living End on The Aussie Invasion tour of US. A new Jet song, &quot;Hold On&quot;, not included on &quot;Get Born&quot;, was used on the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack that year. TV and film producer J. J. Abrams contacted them to record a song for the Season 4 of &quot;Alias&quot;. &quot;Cold Hard Bitch&quot; from &quot;Get Born&quot; was used, and used during a frenetic scene of two CIA agents sprinting down a Hong Kong street, giving the band further US exposure.

Later in 2004 Jet received nominations for the annual US Radio Music Awards, including Artist of the Year: Rock Radio, Artist of the Year: Rock Alternative Radio, and Song of the Year: Rock Radio (for &quot;Cold Hard Bitch&quot;). They also received the 32nd Annual American Music Awards nomination as Favorite Artist – Alternative Music, as well as three nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, held in Miami in August. &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Video, Best New Artist and Best Editing in a video. Jet performed &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; live at the ceremony and picked up the award for Best Rock Video, dedicating it to the Cesters&#x27; late father.

Following their success in the US, back home the group headed the leader board at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 by winning six categories: Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Get Born&quot; as well as Single of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;. They were also nominated for Highest-Selling Album. At the ceremony in October the quartet performed &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;; while Nic provided lead vocals on a cover version of Stevie Wright&#x27;s &quot;Evie (part 1)&quot; as a member of an Australian super-group the Wrights, with Spiderbait&#x27;s Kram (drums), the Living End&#x27;s Chris Cheney (guitar), Dallas Crane&#x27;s Pat Bourke (bass guitar) and You Am I&#x27;s Davey Lane (guitar). &quot;Get Born&quot;″s &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot; (No. 24) and &quot;Get What You Need&quot; (No. 89) were listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004.

During a show at the MCG in October 2005, Nic declared that he considered his group to be &quot;up there with the greatests, with fucking Lennon and the Stones.&quot; This caused controversy but was settled when Australian music magazines began publishing articles comparing Jet&#x27;s albums with those of famous 1960s and 1970s bands. &quot;Get Born&quot; is listed at No. 89 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010). The authors described it as &quot;free of the neurotic self-examination that passes for meaningful songwriting in the post-Nirvana era.&quot;

===&quot;Shine On&quot; (2006–2008)===

&quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot; was released to radio as a single in August 2006 ahead of their second album, &quot;Shine On&quot;. It followed on 30 September (2 October in the UK, 3 October in the US) with a physical listing of 15 tracks. An extra track, &quot;Coming Home Soon&quot;, was available only from the ITunes Store. &quot;Shine On&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the Australian charts and was accredited platinum by ARIA in 2006. Critical reaction to the album was mixed, with British music magazine &quot;NME&quot;″s Paul McNamee calling it &quot;another joyfully old-fashioned rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll album immersed in the classics.&quot; US music blogger Ray Suzuki of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album 0.0 out of 10 and posted a video of a chimpanzee urinating in its own mouth instead of a written review. &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot; appeared on the &quot;Chuck&quot; TV series pilot episode, &quot;Chuck Versus the Intersect&quot;. It also was added to a compilation CD, &quot;NME: The Essential Bands – Festival Edition&quot;.

Jet played at the MTV Europe Awards in Copenhagen in early November 2006. It was their first live performance since Nic&#x27;s laryngitis halted their World Tour early in the previous month. In mid-November Jet returned to Australia and performed at the Make Poverty History Concert at Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Melbourne. They also held a show on a barge floating on the Yarra River. The performance was broadcast via Triple J&#x27;s radio programme &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;.

The next singles from &quot;Shine On&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Back&quot; (in the UK) and &quot;Rip It Up&quot; (in Australia) appeared in late 2006. The album provided a five-track EP, also titled &quot;Shine On&quot;, which was issued in December. The title track, &quot;Shine On&quot;, was released on various dates in March 2007 as a single. It is a tribute to the Cesters&#x27; father, who had died of cancer in 2004. The track was written by Nic from the perspective of his father encouraging those who outlived him to &quot;shine on&quot;. Other songs on the album (&quot;Come On Come On&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Back&quot;, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;All You Have to Do&quot;) deal with overcoming adversity and challenge. &quot;Shine On&quot;″s &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot; (No. 72) and &quot;Rip It Up&quot; (No. 76) were listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006.

Jet co-headlined the 2007 Big Day Out festivals in Australia and New Zealand, alongside fellow headliners Tool, Muse, the Killers, and My Chemical Romance. Also in that year, they released &quot;Falling Star&quot; for the &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; soundtrack, while &quot;Rip It Up&quot; appeared on the &quot;TMNT&quot; soundtrack, which also was the official theme for the wrestling show &quot;WWE&quot;″s 2010 &quot;SummerSlam&quot;. In June and August, they supported the Rolling Stones on the European leg of their A Bigger Bang World Tour in Lisbon, Madrid and London (O2 Arena).

In October 2007 the band returned to Australia to perform at the AFL Grand Final and to finish the rest of their world tour. In November the members announced they would take &quot;some time off&quot; as they needed &quot;down time&quot;. On 24 October Chris and Wilson produced a song &quot;I Spy I Spy&quot;, under the moniker the Vice Lords, for the Japanese former duo Superfly. They collaborated with Iggy Pop to release a joint rendition of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s single &quot;Wild One&quot; as &quot;The Wild One – A Tribute to Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&quot; on its 50th anniversary in July 2008. It also appeared on the compilation and tribute album of the same name later that year.

===&quot;Shaka Rock&quot; and disbandment (2009–2012)===

In a video on their website band members talked about writing and recording songs at Atlantic Sound Studios in New York City; Chris quipped: &quot;We&#x27;ve got to stop writing; we got too many songs.&quot; Jet returned to Australia to play a show in Melbourne on 17 December to debut new material, &quot;Goodbye Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Start the Show&quot;, &quot;Black Hearts&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and &quot;Beat On Repeat&quot;. Muncey expressed that he &quot;really, really loves the song &#x27;Seventeen&#x27;... I think is sort of a step forward for us songwriting-wise. It&#x27;s sorta got everything wrapped into one, a storyline, and sad to say melancholy. It&#x27;s rock and roll, it&#x27;s rocking, it&#x27;s got all these other albums to it, you know, so I find it really interesting.&quot;

Jet played at Melbourne Cricket Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief, which was a multi-venue rock music concert in support of relief for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The Melbourne event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne Concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Half the proceeds from the Sydney concert went to the Victorian Bushfire relief and the other half for Queensland Flood relief. Appearing with Jet in Sydney were Coldplay, Eskimo Joe, Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, the Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists. Jet and Wolfmother were the only groups to perform at both venues.

Jet&#x27;s song, &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot; from &quot;Shaka Rock&quot;, appeared on a &quot;NCIS&quot; Season 7 Episode 2 – &quot;Reunion&quot;. In April 2009, &quot;K.I.A (Killed in Action)&quot; was made available on the band&#x27;s official website. It was the 5th most added song to radio in Australia. &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot;, the first single from the album, was issued in June 2009. &quot;Shaka Rock&quot; appeared Australia on 21 August 2009, which peaked at number five and was accredited platinum by ARIA in 2019.

&quot;Black Hearts (On Fire)&quot; was released as its second single in November 2009 with a music video provided. &quot;Black Hearts&quot; also appeared in the Australian film adaptation of &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot;. In November 2009 &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot; was certified Gold by ARIA for shipment of more than 35,000 copies. &quot;Timothy (Where Have You Been)&quot; was used on the album &quot;Shock Value II&quot; by US record producer Timbaland. In December the quartet were the support act for punk rock trio Green Day on the Australian leg of their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. &quot;Shaka Rock&quot;″s &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot; (No. 77) was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2009.

&quot;Seventeen&quot; was issued as the third single in April 2010, which reached No. 31 and was certified gold by ARIA. During that month the group appeared on TV variety show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;″s first episode since the reunion series, for performances of &quot;She&#x27;s a Genius&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot;. From September to November 2010 the rock quartet toured Australia as the support act for Powderfinger&#x27;s Sunsets Farewell Tour. While Nic and Muncey were on a hiatus from performing, in early 2011 Wilson on bass guitar and Chris on lead vocals formed a doom-disco band, the DamnDogs, in Los Angeles with Louis Macklin on keyboards and electronics and Mitch McIvor (Cesters&#x27; cousin) on guitar. They released a debut EP &quot;Strange Behaviour&quot; on 9 August 2011 via iTunes. On 26 March 2012 Jet announced their &quot;discontinuation as a group,&quot; via their official website and Facebook:
According to &quot;Infectious Magazine&quot;″s Rachel Schuler, &quot;Later it was stated that personal issues and arguments were the reason for the split.&quot;

===Reformations and upcoming fourth album (2016–present)===
Jet members announced in September 2016 that they would reform in the following year and were due to open five shows for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Summer &#x27;17&quot; tour in February 2017. In October 2016 they announced on social media that their first headline show in 6 years was due at Sydney&#x27;s Taronga Zoo also in February 2017. For the performance they were joined on stage by Macklin on keyboards and the Wolfgramm Sisters on backing vocals. The show subsequently sold out, so a second one was added. Jet had made their official live return at a one-off headlining show at Melbourne&#x27;s Gasometer Hotel on 31 January 2017. They performed with Macklin and played a 23 song set-list, which drew from all three of studio albums.

While living in Italy, Nic had been invited by Simone Cogo ( the Bloody Beetroots or DJ Bob Rifo) to collaborate on &quot;My Name Is Thunder&quot;. Once Nic&#x27;s band mates were appraised they joined the project, which was issued as a single in July 2017. The track is the Australian rock group&#x27;s first new song in seven years. It also appeared on the Italian artist&#x27;s album, &quot;The Great Electronic Swindle&quot; (October 2017), Rifo reflected, &quot;we had different ideas on the mixing and from that, we came up with two versions. It&#x27;s the best of both our worlds!&quot;

In 2018 the quartet announced their 15th anniversary Australian national tour for &quot;Get Born&quot;, with dates in Newcastle, Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne. They issued their first live album &quot;Get Born: Live at the Forum&quot; in May to commemorate that tour. They made a brief UK visit, playing in Manchester and London. They supported Jimmy Barnes alongside Eskimo Joe in 2019, and played their final show of their reunion at the By The C open-air concert in Coffs Harbour on 26 October 2019.

Nic then resumed his solo career, releasing an album, &quot;The Skipping Girl&quot;, in 2021. It was a companion to his first children&#x27;s book of the same name. Nic as a member of a supergroup the Jaded Hearts Club had issued &quot;You&#x27;ve Always Been Here&quot; in October 2020. Wilson performed as a member of the Australian Rock Collective (or ARC), which included Kram, Powderfinger&#x27;s Darren Middleton and Davey Lane. ARC perform tribute shows of classic albums, such as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot;.

At the end of 2022 Nic was interviewed on a podcast and revealed Jet were in talks to reunite in the studio. &quot;Next year is the 20 year anniversary of the release of the first Jet album. We&#x27;re actually in discussions right now, sharing musical ideas for the first time with the idea of maybe trying to release some new material next year. This is just as of 3 weeks ago, so we&#x27;ll see if it happens or not. It&#x27;s looking good so far.&quot; In June 2023 the quartet officially announced their reunion and shared Australian tour dates for that September where they would perform &quot;Get Born&quot; in its entirety. Shortly before the tour began, they announced that Los Angeles resident Chris would not be joining the tour due to a family emergency. Macklin had returned as touring keyboardist, while Pete Marin took on drums in place of Chris. Jet were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the 2023 ARIA Music Awards in November. At the ceremony they performed a medley of their hits, &quot;Cold Hard Bitch&quot;, &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot; and &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;.

In April 2024, Jet announced that after 15 years, they had started work on a new album, tentatively due for release in 2025. The band also announced a limited edition 7-inch vinyl record containing the new song &quot;Hurry Hurry&quot;, which was released in May. A music video for &quot;Hurry Hurry&quot; was released in September 2024.

==Activism==
In 2007 Jet members joined a public campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which called for an end to Canada&#x27;s annual seal hunt. The petition was signed by some 150,000 names, which included fellow Australian musicians John Butler, members of Something for Kate, Red Riders and the Vines.

===The Fred Hollows Foundation===
In May 2008, Jet released a video clip on YouTube, which is tribute to the work of the late Fred Hollows and The Fred Hollows Foundation. Nic highlighted Hollow&#x27;s work to restore sight to people blinded by cataracts in developing countries, which was ongoing 15 years after his death. &quot;Hollows was such a big figure in Australia and he had a huge impact, but he passed away when there was still work to do,&quot; Cester said in a statement. &quot;This clip is a bit of a reminder, hopefully it encourages people to make a donation to keep [Hollow]&#x27;s work going.&quot; The video tribute uses Jet&#x27;s song &quot;Shine On&quot; along with images compiled by The Fred Hollows Foundation.

<text>Shau Kei Wan or Shaukiwan is a neighborhood in the Eastern District of Hong Kong Island. The area is bordered by Chai Wan to the east, Mount Parker to the south, Sai Wan Ho to the west, and Victoria Harbour to the north. 

Shau Kei Wan is considered as an area surrounded by A Kung Ngam Road and A Kung Ngam Village Road to the east, Yiu Hing Road and Shau Kei Wan Road to the south, Junction of Aldrich Bay Road and Shau Kei Wan Road to the west, and Oi Kan Road to the north. 

==Etymology==
&quot;Shau Kei&quot; is the Chinese word for a basket used to wash rice, much like a colander, and &quot;Wan&quot; means &quot;bay&quot;. The name, which appeared at least as early as the Ming dynasty in the book &quot;The Great Chronicles of Yue&quot; (, albeit written as ), refers to the former shape of the nearby bay, which is now named Aldrich Bay, after a British Army major who improved troop discipline.

Another name for the area is &quot;Ngor Yan Wan&quot; (). Legend has it the name came about after a group of British merchants were marooned in the area following a typhoon in the 18th century, only to find that there was no food to buy in the area.

== History ==
In the early 18th century, local fishermen discovered Shau Kei Wan as a good storm shelter and eventually, the fishing population began to move into the area, away from Chai Wan, which housed most of the fishing populations for years. Also, Hakka people from Huizhou began to move into the area to operate quarries during this time, and began building houses along the coastline. The population grew, and by the 1841 Hong Kong census, the area housed approximately 1,200 people, roughly 5% of Hong Kong Island&#x27;s population. Most of the residents in the area lived in fishing boats at the time.

By 1860, piracy became a serious issue, and Colonial Governor Richard Macdonnell began to crack down on crime and revitalise the area. During the process, the entire area was replanned with proper roads and housing. Police dispatch posts were also built for the authorities to better combat piracy.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Shau Kei Wan was 5,908. The number of males was 4,317. Life for Shau Kei Wan as an industrial area began in the 1920s, when light industries began to move into the area.

After World War II, Shau Kei Wan gradually developed into a fish-trading market (a position it still holds today). Also, many Mainland China refugees began to settle into the area at this time, and built around 13 mountain villages in the ensuing years. Most of them were slum houses, and sanitations in those areas were generally atrocious. In the 1960s, the Hong Kong Government began to replan the area once more, building public housing estates and beginning landfill projects. The plans went ahead slowly until 1975, when a large fire burnt down many of the slum houses in the Aldrich Bay Typhon Shelter which were built along the shore &amp; over the water of the bay. Afterwards, the government began to bulldoze slum areas and built public housing in its place.

Today, Shau Kei Wan is a densely populated residential district. However, the change over the years has come with a cost: it is said that the coastline has suffered a great change since the late 19th century.

=== Eastern District Tourist Trail (Shau Kei Wan Section) ===

Hidden amidst the high-rise residential towers of the Eastern District is a trail that will showcase the hustle and bustle of everyday life in the area. Visitors can discover vestiges of Hong Kong&#x27;s seafaring past at the A Kung Ngam Shipyards and the Shau Kei Wan Wholesale Fish Market. (The sea has always been an important part of life in Shau Kei Wan. Its name comes from the shape of the neighbouring bay: shau kei means &quot;colander&quot; and wan means &quot;bay&quot;.)

The historical trail starts at the tram terminus and heads along Shau Kei Wan Main Street East towards the waterfront before ending at the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence. Along the way, you will see temples dedicated to different gods: Shing Wong, Tin Hau, Tam Kung and Yuk Wong.

=== Shau Kei Wan Main Street East ===
Shau Kei Wan Main Street East () is one of the most important streets in Shau Kei Wan district. In the 19th century, the street was on the waterfront. In 1860s, to crack down the pirates hiding in the area, the Hong Kong government decided to open up the area and to build houses and stores on the two sides of the road.

Today, restaurants and groceries handed down from the past still operate along the street while the old houses have been replaced by modern high-rises. It becomes a popular dining place with a myriad of well-known international restaurants and street food stores.

When the street was widened the hundred-year-old fig tree in the middle of the street was preserved on the request of the community. The botanical name of this old fig is Ficus superba.

===Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence===
A famous tourist attraction of Shau Kei Wan is the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence. It is a museum located near Lei Yue Mun with a total area of 34,200 square meters. The museum was built by the British in 1887. It was originally built for coastal defence, especially for the east Victoria Harbour, but it is currently an exhibition center. Inside, there are castle, defence basement, military vehicle and weapons on display.

=== Shau Kei Wan Wholesale Fish Market ===
One important primary product of Hong Kong is marine fish. Fresh marine fish are distributed to outside retail market after wholesaling in , which is located at 37 Tam Kung Temple Road, Shau Kei Wan (). Facilities for the landing and wholesale of fresh marine fish are provided. It is one of the seven wholesale fish market operated by the Fish Market Organization. It is currently the second largest in Hong Kong, after the one in Aberdeen.

=== Temples ===

Developed from a fishing village, special religious beliefs are formed. Besides worshiping Tin Hau, residents, who were historically mainly fishermen, also worship Tam Kung. It is believed that since Tam Kung can control the weather and heal the sick, people worship Tam Kung for a safe return from the sea. Tam Kung is a unique religious belief in Hong Kong and temples worshiping Tam Kung can mostly be found here.

There are temples on Shau Kei Wan Main Street East which are dedicated to Shing Wong, Tin Hau, Tam Kung and Yuk Wong. Tin Hau Temple and Tam Kung Temple are relatively famous. In the past, fishermen worshiped them for safety at sea. Although the fishing industry in the area has been diminishing, the tradition still continues.

=== Tsung Tsin Church ===
Located on Basel Road adjacent to Shau Kei Wan Main Street East, the church was built in 1862 by local Hakka and priests from the Swiss Basel Church. It was originally built to a country house style. After reconstruction in 1933, it became a well established church. It was occupied as the temporary headquarters of military police during the Japanese invasion in 1941. In 1958, a school was built next to it. After that, it was rebuilt and used as church again and was expanded in 1984.

== Transportation ==

=== In the past ===
In earlier times, Shau Kei Wan, along with the rest of the Island, did not have a good transportation system. This, coupled with the relative distance of Central and Wan Chai (other population centers of the time), made transportation rather inconvenient.

For most of its modern history, Shau Kei Wan&#x27;s major connection with the rest of the island was King&#x27;s Road (). Its only major connection with its eastern neighbour of Chai Wan was Chai Wan Road (), which was notorious for its steep incline.

In 1904, a single-track tram service between North Point () and Shau Kei Wan was established.

After World War II, Hong Kong experienced a population boom, and factories, along with people, started to move into Shau Kei Wan. This created considerable congestion, and public buses began to serve the area in an effort to alleviate the problem. Their efforts proved to be ineffective, and congestion continued up until the point where the MTR and the Island Eastern Corridor were completed and introduced to the region. To further alleviate congestion problems, ferry companies began a service from Shau Kei Wan to Central to get people to work on time.

All of these transportation impediments gave birth to a once-popular maxim: &quot; (&quot;. This translates to &quot;A &#x27;hero&#x27; is trapped in Shau Kei Wan without knowing which day he will reach Central.&quot;

Nowadays, as different means of transportation are well developed, one can travel between the two places within very short time, even if one takes the slow tram.

The track system runs east from Sai Wan Ho to the west of the northern part of Hong Kong Island linking Shau Kei Wan and Kennedy Town. It is the longest tram track in Hong Kong while the whole track system was completed in 1904. Although there exists various types of transportation, some residents still prefer using trams because of tradition and the extremely low fare.

<text>Andrea Chénier () is a verismo opera in four acts by Umberto Giordano, set to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica, and first performed on 28 March 1896 at La Scala, Milan. The story is based loosely on the life of the French poet André Chénier (1762–1794), who was executed during the French Revolution. The character Carlo Gérard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice. Giuseppe Borgatti&#x27;s triumph in the title role at the first performance immediately propelled him to the front rank of Italian opera singers. He went on to become Italy&#x27;s greatest Wagnerian tenor, rather than a verismo-opera specialist.

==Performance history==

The work was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 28 March 1896 with Evelina Carrera, Giuseppe Borgatti (who replaced Alfonso Garulli at the eleventh hour) and Mario Sammarco in the leading parts of soprano, tenor and baritone respectively. Rodolfo Ferrari conducted.

Other notable first performances include those in New York City at the Academy of Music on 13 November 1896; in Hamburg on 3 February 1897 under the baton of Gustav Mahler; and in London&#x27;s Camden Theatre on 16 April 1903 (sung in English).

Apart from Borgatti, famous Chéniers in the period between the opera&#x27;s premiere and the outbreak of World War II included Francesco Tamagno (who studied the work with Giordano), Bernardo de Muro, Giovanni Zenatello, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Beniamino Gigli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi and Antonio Cortis. Enrico Caruso also gave a few performances as Chénier in London in 1907. All of these tenors with the exception of Borgatti have left 78-rpm recordings of one or more of the part&#x27;s showpiece solos.

Post-war, Franco Corelli, Richard Tucker and Mario Del Monaco were the most famous interpreters of the title role during the 1950s and 1960s, while Plácido Domingo became its foremost interpreter among the next generation of tenors, although Domingo&#x27;s contemporary Luciano Pavarotti also sang and recorded the work. The Wagnerian tenor Ben Heppner tackled the role in New York City at a 2007 Metropolitan Opera revival with mixed success; his voice was impressively powerful but did not fit the style, critics alleged.

The Keith Warner-directed production was performed in 2011 and 2012 in Bregenz, Austria, under the name of &quot;André Chénier&quot;, using an almost 78-foot high statue of a dying Jean-Paul Marat sinking in the water, an ode to the 1793 Jacques-Louis David painting, &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, which depicts the murdered revolutionary slumped over in his bathtub.

In addition to four arias for the principal tenor (&quot;Un dì all&#x27;azzurro spazio&quot;; &quot;Io non amato ancor&quot;; &quot;Si, fui soldato&quot;; &quot;Come un bel dì di maggio&quot;), the opera contains a well-known aria (&quot;La mamma morta&quot;) for the soprano heroine, which was featured in the film &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (the Maria Callas version is used on the soundtrack.) Also worth noting are the baritone&#x27;s expressive monologue &quot;Nemico della patria&quot; and the final, rousing, soprano–tenor duet for the two leads as they prepare to face the guillotine (&quot;Vicino a te&quot;).

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
:Time: 1789–94.
:Place: In and around Paris.

===Act 1===
&quot;Palace of the Countess of Coigny&quot;

Servants are preparing the Palace for a ball. Carlo Gérard, the majordomo, is filled with indignation at the sight of his aged father, worn out by long years of heavy labour for their noble masters. Only the Countess&#x27; daughter Maddalena escapes his hatred, since he is besotted with her. Maddalena jokes with Bersi, her mulatta servant girl. The Countess rebukes Maddalena for dallying around when she should be dressing for the ball.

The guests arrive. Among them is an Abbé who has come from Paris with news about the poor decisions of King Louis XVI&#x27;s government. Also among the guests is the dashing and popular poet, Andrea Chénier.

The soirée begins with a &quot;pastoral&quot; performance. A chorus of shepherds and shepherdesses sing idealised rustic music and a ballet mimics a rural love story in stately court fashion. The Countess asks Chénier to improvise a poem but he says that inspiration has abandoned him. Maddalena asks Chénier to recite a verse, but he refuses her also, saying that &quot;Fantasy is not commanded on cue.&quot; The laughter of the girls draws the Countess&#x27; attention, and Maddalena explains mockingly that the Muse of poetry is absent from the party. Chénier now becomes angry and improvises a poem about the suffering of the poor, ending with a tirade against those in power in church and state, shocking the guests. Maddalena begs forgiveness.

The guests dance a gavotte, which is interrupted by a crowd of ragged people who ask for food, Gérard ushers them in announcing that &quot;Her Greatness, Misery&quot; has arrived to the party. The Countess confronts Gérard who repudiates his service and throws his livery at the feet of the Countess, taking his father with him, who threw himself at the feet of the Countess. She orders them all out, and comforts herself by thoughts of her gifts to charity. The ball continues as if nothing had happened.

===Act 2===
&quot;Café Hottot in Paris, during the Reign of Terror&quot;

Bersi, now a &quot;merveilleuse&quot;, chats with an &quot;incroyable&quot;. She asks him if he is a spy for Robespierre, but he says that he is a mere &quot;observer of the public spirit&quot;. Bersi asserts she has nothing to hide as &quot;a child of the Revolution&quot;.

A tumbrel passes, bearing condemned prisoners to the guillotine, mocked by the crowd. Bersi leaves. The Incroyable notes that she was with a blonde woman he is looking for; he also notes that Chénier is at a nearby table waiting nervously and that Bersi had made signs at him.

Chénier&#x27;s friend Roucher enters. He reminds Chénier that he is under suspicion for his association with disgraced General Dumoriez and urges him to flee. He offers Chénier a false passport. Chénier refuses: his destiny is love; he has been waiting for a mysterious woman who has sent him letters. Roucher sees the last letter, and dismisses it as from a prostitute and he warns Chénier that love is dangerous during the Révolution. He persuades Chénier to take the passport.

A procession of revolutionary leaders passes, including Robespierre and Gérard, who enters the café. The Incroyable reports to him about Bersi and the possible connection with the blonde, whom Gérard has been seeking, saying that she will come to the café that night. Bersi returns, and pleads with Roucher to keep Chénier there. She leaves for a dance with the Incroyable. Roucher persuades Chénier to leave, but Bersi, quickly returning, tells Chénier to wait for a woman called &quot;Speranza&quot; (Hope); all leave, except the Incroyable, who returns and hides.

A hooded woman enters. It is &quot;Speranza&quot;. She uncovers herself, and Chénier recognizes her as Maddalena de Coigny. The Incroyable leaves to tell Gérard. Despite the danger, Chénier and Maddalena proclaim their love in a passionate duet.

As they prepare to leave, they are discovered by Gérard. Chénier sends Maddalena away with Roucher and wounds Gérard in a sword fight. Believing he is dying, Gérard warns Chénier to flee from the wrath of the public prosecutor Fouquier-Tinville, Chénier&#x27;s enemy, and asks him to protect Maddalena. The Incroyable returns with soldiers and a crowd, but Gérard tells them that his assailant is unknown to him. All blame the Girondists.

===Act 3===
&quot;The Revolutionary Tribunal&quot;

The &quot;sans-culotte&quot; Mathieu calls on the people to give money for the army of the Revolution, but they refuse. Gérard, who has recovered, enters and renews the appeal and the people react with enthusiasm. A blind woman named Madelon comes in with her grandson, whom she gives to be a soldier of the Revolution. The crowd disperses.

The Incroyable reports to Gérard that Chénier has been arrested in the Parisian suburb of Passy and interned in the Luxembourg Palace, and it is only a matter of time before Maddalena will come for him. He urges Gérard to write down the charges against Chénier for his trial. Gérard hesitates but the Incroyable convinces him that a conviction by the Tribunal will only secure Maddalena&#x27;s appearance. Alone, he muses that his Revolutionary ideals are being betrayed by his false charges, therefore he is still a slave: formerly of the nobles, now of his own lust. Finally desire triumphs and he signs the indictment in a mood of cynicism. (Gérard: &quot;Nemico della patria?!&quot;) The Incroyable takes it to the Tribunal.

Maddalena enters to plead for Chénier&#x27;s life. Gérard admits that he had Chénier arrested to control Maddalena. He has been in love with her since they were children and he remembers the time when they were allowed to play together in the fields of her house, how when he was handed his first livery, he watched in secret Maddalena learning to dance at the time when he was in charge of opening doors, but now he is a powerful man and will have his way. Maddalena refuses: she will shout out her name in the streets and be executed as an aristocrat, but if her virtue is the price for Chénier&#x27;s life, then Gérard can have her body.

Gérard is about to take her but recoils when he realizes the love that she professes for Chénier. Maddalena sings how the mob murdered her mother and burned her palace, how she escaped, and how Bersi became a prostitute to support them both. She laments how she brings disgrace to all that she loves and finally how Chénier was the force that gave life back to her.

Gérard searches for the indictment to cancel it, but it has already gone. He pledges to save Chénier&#x27;s life even at the cost of his own. A clerk presents the list of accused persons, including Chénier. A crowd of spectators enter, then the judges, presided over by Dumas, and Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor, then the prisoners. One by one, the prisoners are hastily condemned. When Chénier is tried, he denies all the charges, and proclaims his honour.

Chénier&#x27;s plea has moved everyone and Fouquier-Tinville is forced to take up witnesses. Gérard approaches the Tribunal and confesses to the falsity of his indictment but Fouquier-Tinville takes up the charges himself. Gérard defies and decries the Tribunal: Justice has become Tyranny, and &quot;we murder our poets.&quot;

Chénier embraces Gérard, who points out Maddalena in the crowd. The Tribunal condemns Chénier to death and he is led off with the other prisoners.

===Act 4===
&quot;Saint-Lazare Prison&quot;

Chénier awaits his execution with Roucher, writing verses of his faith in truth and beauty. Roucher leaves, as Mathieu sings the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; outside.

Maddalena enters with Gérard for a last meeting with Chénier. Maddalena bribes the jailer Schmidt to let her change places with a condemned noblewoman. Gérard leaves to make a last appeal to Robespierre.

The lovers sing about their love and their deliverance from this world after death. As dawn approaches, Schmidt calls their names. They go to face the guillotine joined in love. While they leave Gérard reappears with a paper in his hand, with the sentence &quot;Even Plato banned poets from his Republic&quot;, written by Robespierre to reject Gérard&#x27;s plea for Chenier&#x27;s life.

<text>Royal Air Force Waddington , commonly known as RAF Waddington, and informally known by its nickname &#x27;Waddo&#x27; is a Royal Air Force station located beside the village of Waddington, south of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, in England.

The station is the RAF&#x27;s Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) hub. It is home to a fleet of aircraft composed of the Beechcraft Shadow R1, Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint, and General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft. Since October 2022, it has also been home to the RAF&#x27;s Aerobatic Team the Red Arrows.

==History==
===First World War===

Waddington station opened as a Royal Flying Corps flying training aerodrome in 1916. Student pilots, including members of the US Army, were taught to fly a variety of aircraft. The station came under the control of the Royal Air Force (RAF) when it was created on 1 April 1918. It operated until 1920, when the station went into care and maintenance.

During and after the First World War, the following squadrons operated from Waddington.
*No. 82 Squadron RFC between 30 March 1917 and 17 November 1917, using the Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, before moving to Saint-Omer in France.
*No. 97 Squadron RFC between 1 December 1917 and 21 January 1918, with no aircraft, before moving to Stonehenge Aerodrome, in Wiltshire.
*No. 105 Squadron RFC formed at the airfield on 23 September 1917, flying various aircraft and stayed until 3 October 1917 when it moved to Andover in Hampshire.
*No. 117 Squadron RFC formed at Waddington on 1 January 1918, flying various aircraft and stayed until 3 April 1918 when the squadron moved to Hucknall in Nottinghamshire.
*No. 123 Squadron RFC formed at the airfield on 1 February 1918 and flew various aircraft before moving to Duxford in Cambridgeshire on 1 March 1918.
*No. 23 Squadron RAF between 15 March 1919 and 31 December 1919 with no aircraft before being disbanded.
*No. 203 Squadron RAF between 27 March 1919 and December 1919 with no aircraft as a cadre before moving to RAF Scopwick, also in Lincolnshire.
*No. 204 Squadron RAF from 11 February 1919 as a cadre with no aircraft until 31 December 1919 when the squadron disbanded.

===Interwar period===
As part of the pre-war expansion programme, the Waddington site was earmarked for development into a fully equipped heavy bomber station. It reopened as a bomber base on 12 March 1937, with No. 50 Squadron arriving on the same day with their Hawker Hinds and then adding the Handley Page Hampden. No. 110 Squadron arrived 15 days later, initially with the Hind before switching to the Bristol Blenheim. On 7 June 1937, No. 88 Squadron reformed at Waddington with the Hind before moving to RAF Boscombe Down in Wiltshire on 17 July 1937. On 16 June 1937, No. 44 Squadron moved in from RAF Andover, flying the Blenheim, before switching to the Avro Anson and the Hampden in February 1939. In May 1939, No. 110 Squadron left for RAF Wattisham in Suffolk. No. 50 Squadron left the following year, being moved to RAF Lindholme in South Yorkshire.

===Second World War===

RAF Waddington began the Second World War housing the Hampdens of No. 44 Squadron and No. 50 Squadron. Both squadrons were in action on the same day as Britain&#x27;s war declaration, attacking German naval targets at Kiel. Waddington squadrons were also involved during the critical stages of the late summer and early autumn of 1940, attacking barges in the channel ports which were being assembled as part of the invasion fleet.

In November 1940, it was the first station to receive the Avro Manchester heavy bomber.

No. 44 Squadron RAF was the first in RAF Bomber Command to fly operationally with the Avro Lancaster on 2 March 1942 from Waddington. BT308, the first prototype Lancaster (or Mk.III Manchester), arrived at Waddington in September 1941 for flight tests. Like RAF Scampton, the station was part of 5 Group.

On 17 April 1942, seven Lancasters of No. 44 Squadron took off from Waddington as part of Operation Margin, a bombing raid on the MAN U-boat engine plant in Augsburg in Germany. The squadron subsequently left Waddington on 31 May 1943, moving to RAF Dunholme Lodge, also in Lincolnshire.

During the Second World War the following squadrons are known to have operated from Waddington.
*No. 97 Squadron reformed on 25 February 1941, with the Avro Manchester before moving to nearby RAF Coningsby on 10 March 1941.
*No. 9 Squadron arrived on 7 August 1942, initially with the Vickers Wellington III, before switching to the Lancaster I and III during September 1942. The squadron moved to RAF Bardney, also in Lincolnshire, on 14 April 1943.

*No. 142 Squadronn was present between 15 June 1940 and 3 July 1940 with the Fairey Battle before moving to RAF Binbrook, also in Lincolnshire.
*No. 207 Squadron reformed at Waddington on 1 November 1940 with the Manchester, adding the Hampden for a month in July 41. The squadron moved to RAF Bottesford on 17 November 1941
*No. 420 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) formed on 19 December 1941 with the Hampden before moving to RAF Skipton-on-Swale in North Yorkshire on 7 August 1942.
*No. 463 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) formed at the airfield on 25 November 1943 with the Lancaster I and III before moving to RAF Skellingthorpe in Lincoln on 3 July 1945.
*No. 467 Sqn RAAF was present between 13 November 1943 and 15 June 1945 with the Lancaster Mks I and III. The squadron then moved to nearby RAF Metheringham.
*No. 617 Squadron was present between 17 June 1945 and 19 January 1946 with the Lancaster VII-FE before moving to RAF Digri in Pakistan.

In May 1975, some of the former Australian aircrew returned to the base.

===Cold War===
During the Cold War, RAF Waddington became an Avro Vulcan V-bomber station, with No. 83 Squadron being the first in the RAF to receive the Vulcan in May 1957. It continued in this role until 1984, when the last Vulcan squadron, No. 50 Squadron, disbanded. From 1968, the UK nuclear deterrent was transferred to Polaris submarines, beginning with .

In August 1960, the station developed the &#x27;sudsmobile&#x27; technique to lay a carpet of foam in around a half-hour for a wheels-up landing. Previously it had taken around three hours to lay a foam carpet on the runway. An English Electric Canberra from RAF Wyton landed wheels-up on 23 August 1960, with a Handley Page Victor managing the same on 5 December 1960.
The fiftieth anniversary of the Royal Air Force was celebrated at the base on 1 April 1968, mainly because the RAF&#x27;s last flying Lancaster was based at the airfield from the mid-1960s.

During the Cold War the following squadrons are known to have operated from Waddington.
*No. 9 Squadron operating the Avro Vulcan B.2 between 1975 and April 1982 when they were disbanded, later reforming at RAF Honington in Suffolk as the first operational Panavia Tornado GR1 squadron.
*No. 12 Squadron between 26 July 1946 and 18 September 1946, initially with the Lancaster I and III before swapping to the Avro Lincoln B.2 and moving to RAF Binbrook.
*No. 21 Squadron and No. 27 Squadron, which were both present from 26 May 1955 until 31 December 1957 with the English Electric Canberra B.2 before being disbanded.
*No. 44 Squadron between 10 August 1960 and 21 December 1982 when they were disbanded; the squadron operated the Avro Vulcan B.1 and B.2.
*No. 50 Squadron were based at Waddington from 26 January 1946 with the Lincoln B.2 before being disbanded on 31 January 1951. It reformed at the airfield on 1 August 1962 and operated the Vulcan B.1, B.2 and B.2K before being disbanded on 31 March 1984.
*No. 57 Squadron between 7 October 1946 and 4 April 1951 with the Lincoln B.2 before moving to RAF Marham in Norfolk, the squadron returned on 4 June 1951 with the Washington B.1 before leaving again on 2 April 1952 to RAF Coningsby.
*No. 61 Squadron starting from 25 January 1946 with the Lancaster I and III before being replaced by the Lincoln B.2. The squadron left on 6 August 1953 moving to RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire.
*No. 83 Squadron from 21 March 1957 with the Vulcan B.1 before being reduced to a cadre with no aircraft and moving to RAF Scampton on 10 August 1960.
*No. 101 Squadron from 26 June 1961 with the Vulcan B.1 and B.2 before being disbanded on 4 August 1982.

RAF Waddington was home to several USAF Coronet deployments throughout the Cold War:
*Coronet Stallion from 21 August to 12 September 1979 saw the deployment of eighteen LTV A-7D Corsair II from the 124th TFS (Iowa ANG), 174th TFS (South Dakota ANG), and 175th TFS (Iowa ANG).
*Coronet Buffalo from 11 May to 8 June 1985 saw the deployment of thirty-three A-7D Corsair IIs and 3 A-7Ks from the 124th TFS (Iowa ANG), 174th TFS (South Dakota ANG), and 175th TFS (Iowa ANG).
*Coronet East 97 from 3 to 15 June 1991 saw the deployment of twelve A-7D Corsair IIs from the 125th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Ohio ANG).

===Falklands War===

During the Falklands War, Operation Black Buck saw three aircraft and crews from Waddington take part in a long-range bombing raid on Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands. The three Vulcan B2s, of No. 44 Squadron, No. 50 Squadron, and No. 101 Squadron, were twenty-two years old, and were selected because they had the more powerful Rolls-Royce Olympus 301 engines. A complicated air-to-air refuelling plan, involving fourteen Handley Page Victor K.2 tankers, was developed, which was only contemplated due to the belief of Sir Mike Beetham, then Chief of the Air Staff, who had developed the RAF&#x27;s in-flight refuelling capability with Vickers Valiants with 214 Squadron at RAF Marham in 1959. Spare parts for the operation were requisitioned from scrapyards in Newark-on-Trent and military museums. The K2 Victor tanker aircraft came from 55 Squadron and 57 Squadron at RAF Marham. Navigation came from the Delco Carousel inertial navigation system.

Later during 1982, there was a female peace camp outside the base for five months.

===1990s===

In July 1991, No. 8 Squadron moved to RAF Waddington and re-equipped with Boeing E-3 Sentrys. In 1993, the only RAF Avro Vulcan bomber maintained by RAF Waddington for flying displays, XH558, was retired due to budget restraints to Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, Leicestershire.

The Electronic Warfare Operational Support Element (EWOSE – now known as the Air Warfare Centre) moved from RAF Wyton to Waddington in March 1995.

In 1998, 26 Squadron RAF Regiment moved to RAF Waddington from RAF Laarbruch in Germany. The squadron was equipped with the Rapier Field standard C short range air defence missile system, and remained at Waddington until its temporary disbandment in 2008.

===21st century===

All of the aircraft-operating squadrons based at RAF Waddington were dispersed to other airfields in July 2014 when the runway was closed for rebuilding. The project, valued at £35 million and due to take 12 months, actually took 26 months, and re-opened to aircraft officially in November 2016. The work was expected to increase the operational capability of the runway and airfield by 25 years.

No. 216 Squadron reformed at Waddington on 1 April 2020 as an experimental unit testing future drone swarm technology.

In September 2020, work to convert an existing aircraft hangar into a joint flight simulator training facility was completed. The facility, operated by the Air Battlespace Training Centre, allows simulators at different locations to be linked together, enabling UK and US crews to train with one another in scenarios which would be difficult to recreate in real life.

No. 5 (Army Co-operation) Squadron was disbanded in March 2021 when the Sentinel R1 was withdrawn from service. The E-3D Sentry was also retired in 2021, with No. 8 Squadron subsequently relocating to RAF Lossiemouth to re-equip with the Wedgetail AEW1.

In August 2022, No. 39 Squadron disbanded, with a MQ-9A Reaper ground control system returning from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada to Waddington for use by No. 13 Squadron, which continued to operate the Reaper.

During early October 2022, the RAF Aerobatic Team; the Red Arrows and its 146 personnel relocated to Waddington from its previous home at RAF Scampton which was scheduled to close.
No. 31 Squadron was re-formed at Waddington in October 2023, equipped with the General Atomics MQ-9B, a remotely piloted air system which is known as the Protector RG1 in RAF service. A new hangar, support facilities and crew accommodation were constructed at Waddington; in 2018 it was said that the cost of this project would be £93million.

==Role and operations==
===ISTAR ===

RAF Waddington is the RAF&#x27;s Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) hub, and is home to a fleet of aircraft composed of Shadow R1 and RC-135W Rivet Joint, and is an operating base for the RAF&#x27;s MQ-9 Reaper.

No. 1 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Wing formed on 1 April 2016. It is a mix of the staff and capabilities of the Tactical Imagery Intelligence Wing (TIW) at RAF Marham, No. 54 Signals Unit at RAF Digby, and No. 5 (AC) Squadron. Waddington is home to the wing headquarters.

===Expeditionary Air Wing===
Various units and squadrons were combined to form a new deployable air force structure, No. 34 Expeditionary Air Wing (34 EAW), at RAF Waddington on 1 April 2006.

===Supported units===
RAF Waddington Voluntary Band is one of seven voluntary bands within the Royal Air Force.

===Gate guardians===

The gate guardian at RAF Waddington is Avro Vulcan XM607, one of three Vulcan bombers (XM597, XM598, XM607) which took part in Operation Black Buck raids between April and June 1982 during the Falklands War. XM607 was stationed at Waddington and took part in the raids, captained by pilots Flight Lieutenant Martin Withers (on mission 1 and 7) and by Squadron Leader John Reeve (on mission 2). In 1984, along with all other remaining Vulcans, XM607 was retired from active service, and was preserved as the gate guardian at Waddington.

A Hawker Hunter F.6A acts as gate guardian outside the No. 8 Squadron facilities at Waddington. Styled as XE620 in No. 8 Squadron markings, the aircraft was originally XE606.

==Previous units==
The following units were also stationed at Waddington at some point:
==Waddington International Airshow==
The first RAF Waddington International Airshow was staged at RAF Waddington in 1995, after the event was moved south from RAF Finningley, a now former Royal Air Force station east of Doncaster (now known Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield) which was closed in that year. Over the following years the RAF Waddington International Airshow developed into the largest of all Royal Air Force air shows. It took place on the first weekend in July, attracting over 140,000 visitors and representatives of air forces from all round the world. The main purpose of the show was to raise public awareness and understanding of the Royal Air Force and its role today. Eighty five percent of the proceeds from the event were distributed to the two main Service charities, the RAF Benevolent Fund (RAFBF) and the RAF Association (RAFA); the remaining 15% was donated to local causes. Since 1995, the airshow has raised almost £3 million for Service and local charities.

In 2015, the station was earmarked for development, a significant part of which being concerned with the station&#x27;s runway, with work scheduled for 59 weeks. This therefore ruled out an airshow during 2015. The timing of the works coincided with a review of the station in general, the continuance of the airshow being also part of the review. The outcome was that having weighed up the content of the report, it was decided that: &quot;significant security risks as well as certain operational risks&quot; resulted from the operation of the RAF Waddington Airshow, and therefore the airshow, for the reasons cited, would not be continued with. These security risks have generally centred on RAF Waddington being used as a base for the operation of Reaper drones.

In February 2016, it was announced that following an agreement between the Royal Air Force and the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, the venue of the airshow would switch from RAF Waddington to RAF Scampton, with the hope that the airshow would be resurrected in 2017.

<text>Royal Air Force Marham, commonly abbreviated RAF Marham is a Royal Air Force station near the village of Marham in the county of Norfolk, East Anglia.

It is home to No. 138 Expeditionary Air Wing (138 EAW) and, as such, is one of the RAF&#x27;s &#x27;main operating bases&#x27; (MOB). Since 6 June 2018, it has been home to the fifth generation Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning operated by No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron. No. 207 Squadron, becoming the second Lightning squadron to be based at RAF Marham when it reformed on 1 August 2019 as the F-35 operational conversion unit (OCU).

==History==
===Beginnings (1916–1919)===
Opened in August 1916 close to the former Royal Naval Air Station Narborough, later RAF Narborough, the Marham base was originally a military night landing ground on an site within the boundary of the present day RAF Marham. In 1916, the aerodrome was handed over to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Throughout the First World War, Marham&#x27;s role was focused on defending Norfolk from Zeppelin raids. No. 51 Squadron became the first RFC unit to be stationed at Marham upon their move in September 1916, flying home defence missions. On the night of 27/28 November 1916, Lt. Gaymer of No. 51 Squadron took off from Marham to intercept Zeppelin L21. However, he crashed his Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b and was killed after making no contact. L21 was later shot down near Lowestoft by Royal Naval Air Service crews.

Outside of home defence, Marham also acted as a training base for night time flying, with this provided by No. 51 Squadron. No. 191 (Night) Training Squadron was formed at Marham on 6 November 1917 to provide training for night time operations, who were based at Marham until moving to Upwood in January 1918. No. 51 Squadron also assisted No. 190 Training Squadron and No. 193 Training Squadron, who were based nearby, throughout late 1917 and 1918. To celebrate the Armistice on 11 November 1918, aircraft from Marham bombed Narborough with bags of flour who in return bombed Marham with bags of soot. No. 51 Squadron departed Marham in May 1919 for Sutton&#x27;s Farm, with the aerodrome closing shortly after.

===Rearmament (1935–1945)===

In the first half of 1935, work started on a new airfield which became active on , with a resident heavy bomber unit from within No. 3 Group, RAF Bomber Command.

The first squadron, No. 38, arrived on 5 May 1937 with Fairey Hendon bombers. In June, No. 115 Squadron re-formed at Marham with the Handley Page Harrow, initially sharing No. 38 Squadron&#x27;s Hendons until Harrow deliveries were completed in August. No. 38 Squadron received Vickers Wellington Mk.I bombers in December 1938, followed in April 1939 by No. 115 Squadron. No. 218 Squadron moved to Marham on 27 Nov 1940, also operating Wellingtons. No. 218 Squadron began conversion to the Short Stirling in December 1941, and used the type on operations from 1942. De Havilland Mosquitos from No. 105 Squadron also arrived in 1941. Marham became part of the Pathfinder force. They also tested and proved the Oboe precision bombing aid.

During March 1944, RAF Marham closed for the construction of new concrete runways, perimeter track, and dispersal areas, marking the end of its wartime operations. The three new runways were of the familiar wartime triangular pattern of class A airfield, but Marham was one of only two sites built as a heavy bomber airfield (the other was nearby RAF Sculthorpe) with the runways substantially longer than the standard layout.

===Cold War (1946–1982)===

From 15 March to 31 October 1946, RAF Marham hosted seven B-17 Flying Fortressess and three modified B-29 Super Fortressess of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during Project &#x27;Ruby&#x27;, which was a series of trials to test the effectiveness of deep penetration bombs such as the Grand Slam and Disney against &quot;massive reinforced concrete targets&quot;. Trials began on 25 March, and were undertaken by the USAAF B-29s and modified Lancasters of No. XV Squadron by attacking the Nordsee III U-boat pen at Heligoland and the U-boat assembly plant at Farge, Germany. Project &#x27;Ruby&#x27; ended on 31 October after 22 trials had been completed, with results concluding that none of the bombs tested were capable of penetrating massive reinforced concrete. Nine B-29s of the 340th Bombardment Squadron arrived at Marham on 9 June 1947 as part of a &#x27;goodwill&#x27; visit to the United Kingdom. Between March 1948 and March 1950, USAF B-29s and B-50s of the 2nd; 22nd; 43rd; 307th and 509th Bombardment Groups spent time based at Marham.

On 22 March 1950, the first four of an eventual 70 Boeing Washington B.1s arrived at Marham. The aircraft were handed over in a ceremony attended by Secretary of State for Air Arthur Henderson, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Bomber Command Air Marshal Hugh Pughe Lloyd, and Major General Leon W. Johnson, Commander of the USAF 3rd Air Division.

In the 1950s, Marham airfield was home to RAF units operating the English Electric Canberra, and later the V-bomber force and tankers: Vickers Valiant and Handley Page Victor. The station is also one of the few large enough for the operation of United States Air Force Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, and a number of these aircraft visited on exercises in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Tornado GR (1982–2019)===

During 1980–83, twenty-four hardened aircraft shelters (HAS) were constructed to house future strike aircraft, which would eventually see the arrival of the Panavia Tornado GR1 in 1982. These shelters were also equipped with the US Weapon Storage Security System (WS3), each able to store four WE.177 nuclear bombs. The first Tornado GR1 to be delivered to Marham was ZA601 on 24 April 1982 from BAe Warton, in preparation for the reformation of No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron which stood up on 1 January 1983. This was shortly followed by No. 27 Squadron which reformed at Marham on 12 August.

No. 57 Squadron disbanded at RAF Marham on 30 June 1986, leaving No. 55 Squadron as the last Victor K2 unit at the base. In March 1987, the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit (TWCU) relocated its Tornados from RAF Honington to Marham for a period of six months while runway repairs were carried out. In March 1988, Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2s of No. 42 Squadron spent a year based at Marham while RAF St. Mawgan had its runway repaired. No. II (Army Co-operation) Squadron relocated from RAF Laarbruch, Germany to Marham in December 1991, bringing with it the Tornado GR1A and its &#x27;Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System&#x27; (TIRRS).

No. 27 Squadron disbanded in September 1993, with its aircraft and crew transferring to No. 12 (Bomber) Squadron who moved to RAF Lossiemouth in January 1994. No. 55 Squadron, the last of the RAF Victor squadrons, disbanded at Marham in October 1993, with the last Victor to leave departing in November. In December, No. 39 (1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit) Squadron arrived at RAF Marham with its Canberra PR7s and PR9s from RAF Wyton.

Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, it was decided to end the Royal Air Force&#x27;s presence in Germany, No. IX (B) Squadron relocated from RAF Brüggen to RAF Marham on 17 July 2001, followed shortly by No. 31 Squadron on 17 August, who landed their Tornados at Marham at precisely 13:31 hrs BST.
No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron disbanded on 31 July 2006, ending 52 years of Canberra operations at Marham. Following the closure of RAF Coltishall in November 2006, RAF Marham was officially granted the Freedom of the City of Norwich in 2008 and, as such, is allowed to march through the streets of Norwich with &#x27;bayonets fixed&#x27;; this is usually carried out on occasions such as the annual Battle of Britain parade held on 12 September every year.

On the night of 19/20 March 2011, No. IX (B) Squadron Tornado GR4s flew a round trip from Marham to carry out Storm Shadow strikes against targets in Libya as part of Operation Ellamy. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, No. XIII Squadron was disbanded on 13 May 2011, followed by No. 14 Squadron on 1 June.

On 26 September 2014, Tornado aircraft began airstrikes against ISIL as part of Operation Shader. In 2015, four Tornados (ZA405, ZA456, ZA548, and ZD788) from RAF Marham received special markings to mark the 100th anniversaries of Nos. IX (B), 12 (B) and 31 Squadrons, as well as the 40th anniversary of Tornado service.

As part of the draw-down of the RAF&#x27;s Tornado GR4 fleet, No. 12 (B) Squadron disbanded on 14 February 2018. Squadron personnel were reassigned to Marham&#x27;s other Tornado squadrons, No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron.

The last eight deployed Tornado GR4s returned home to RAF Marham from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, on 4 and 5 February 2019. To mark the nearing Tornado retirement, RAF Marham held a series of &#x27;farewell flypasts&#x27; across the United Kingdom on 19, 20 and 21 February. On 28 February, nine Tornado GR4s flew from RAF Marham for a diamond nine formation flypast over RAF Cranwell, which was holding a graduation parade, before returning to Marham to carry out several passes over the airbase. RAF Marham saw the final flight of an RAF Tornado (ZA463) on 14 March during the disbandment parade of No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron. The Tornado GR4 was completely retired from service on 1 April 2019, leaving the F-35 Lightning as the sole type based at RAF Marham.

===Project Anvil (2016–2018)===
Project Anvil was the £250 million programme of investment to provide Marham with new and upgraded infrastructure for F-35B Lightning operations. The enabling works, worth £25 million, were undertaken by Balfour Beatty and Henry Brothers, with work commencing in May 2016. These works involved demolition of hangar no.3 located on the north side of the airfield. The hangar dated from the 1930s, and was last used for Tornado depth engineering. In its place, the new Lightning Maintenance and Finish Facility was completed.

In late 2016, Wates Group was awarded a £27 million contract to construct a new squadron building for No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron in the south west hardened aircraft shelters area. Construction began in March 2017, and was completed in spring 2018.
The Lightning National Operating Centre (NOC) was constructed on the north-west side of the airfield, near the station golf course. The NOC was designed to accommodate around 125 personnel who form the Lightning Force Headquarters and Logistics Operating Centre. The NOC, the first Project Anvil building to be completed, was opened by the Queen, the station&#x27;s Honorary Air Commodore, on 2 February 2018. In April 2016, Balfour Beatty were awarded a contract worth £82.5 million to construct a joint Lockheed Martin / BAE Systems Lightning European Maintenance Hub. The hub comprised an Integrated Training Centre (ITC), a Logistics Operations Centre, and a Maintenance and Finishing Facility (M&amp;F) across three separate sites at Marham. The ITC was built on the south side of the airfield, and was designed to provide maintainer training and accommodate the Lightning Full Mission Simulators.

The final construction contracts, worth £135 million, were awarded to Galliford Try and Lagan Construction in June 2017. The work included construction of a new hangar to replace hangar no.1, rebuilding of Marham&#x27;s runways, installation of vertical landing pads, new taxiways, and refurbishment of 90% of existing taxiways and airfield operating surfaces. Both runways were rebuilt during a three-week period (8–28 September 2017), which saw all flying cease and the laying of more than 18,000 tonnes of new asphalt. The resurfacing works were completed by June 2018. Project Anvil also included construction of servicing platforms and refurbishment of hardened aircraft shelters. Facilities for the operational conversion unit (OCU) were built between the No. 617 Squadron hardened aircraft shelters and the Integrated Training Centre.

===F-35B Lightning (2018–)===

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced in March 2013 that the entire British fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning aircraft, which would be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, would be based at RAF Marham. The Lightning is a fifth-generation short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) multi-role combat aircraft designed to operate from the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers.

The first aircraft arrived at Marham on 6 June 2018, when four F-35Bs of No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron, supported by three Voyagers and an Atlas, made an eight-hour transit flight across the Atlantic from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina. The RAF announced on 5 July 2017 that No. 207 Squadron will be the operational conversion unit (OCU) for the F-35 Lightning. No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron, became the first operational unit on 11 January 2019. Six F-35Bs of No. 207 Squadron arrived at RAF Marham from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort on 16 July 2019, before the squadron officially reformed on 1 August 2019.

In late January 2020, F-35Bs from No. 207 Squadron departed for , becoming the first British squadron in a decade to operate jet aircraft from a British aircraft carrier in home waters. On 3 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth II visited personnel at the base and inspected the F-35B aircraft, her first official royal engagement of the new decade.

On 3 September 2020, ten United States Marine Corps (USMC) F-35Bs from VMFA-211 arrived at RAF Marham to operate alongside the Dambusters. On 22 September, both squadrons embarked on for Exercise Joint Warrior. In late October, both units participated in Exercise Crimson Warrior, the largest UK exercise in over a decade.

A replacement kennel facility for military working dogs was opened at Marham in September 2024. The facility cost £23 million and is separated into three blocks capable of accommodating 48 dogs. It includes exercise areas; a veterinary block with isolation kennels; and facilities for the RAF Police.

==Role and operations==
===Command===
Group Captain Phil Marr was appointed as RAF Marham station commander in July 2021. The station is close to the Royal Estate of Sandringham, and Queen Elizabeth II was the station&#x27;s Honorary Air Commodore. The late Queen made a number of visits to the station, most recently on 3 February 2020. RAF Marham was under the command of No. 1 Group (Air Combat) RAF.

The airfield moved from No. 1 Group (Air Combat) to No. 2 Group (Air Combat Support Group) on 28 April 2023, becoming the lead station for the East Region, the site is also twinned with HMNB Portsmouth.

<text>Robert Francis Furchgott (June 4, 1916 – May 19, 2009) was an American biochemist winning Nobel Prize who contributed to the discovery of nitric oxide as a transient cellular signal in mammalian systems.

==Early life and education==
Furchgott was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Arthur Furchgott (December 1884 – January 1971), a department store owner, and Pena (Sorentrue) Furchgott. He graduated with from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1937 with a degree in chemistry and went on to earn a Ph.D in biochemistry at Northwestern University in 1940.

==Career==

Furchgott was faculty member and professor of pharmacology at Cornell University Medical College from 1940 to 1949, at Washington University School of Medicine from 1949 to 1956, at SUNY Brooklyn from 1956 to 1989, and at the University of Miami from 1989 through the end of his career.

In 1978, Furchgott discovered a substance in endothelial cells that relaxes blood vessels, calling it endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). By 1986, he had worked out EDRF&#x27;s nature and mechanism of action, and determined that EDRF was in fact nitric oxide (NO), an important compound in many aspects of cardiovascular physiology. This research is important in explaining a wide variety of neuronal, cardiovascular, and general physiologic processes of central importance in human health and disease.

In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nitric oxide as a new cellular signal in 1998 with Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad,

 Furchgott&#x27;s discovery that nitric oxide causes blood vessels to dilate provided a long-sought explanation for the therapeutic effects of nitroglycerin used to treat angina pectoris and was later instrumental in the development of the erectile dysfunction treatment drug Viagra.

In 1991, Furchgott received a Gairdner Foundation International Award for his groundbreaking discoveries. He also received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1996 and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1999 with Ferid Murad.

==Personal life==
Furchgott was Jewish and lived most of his married and career life in Woodmere, New York on Long Island. He was married to Lenore Mandelbaum (February 1915 – April 1983) from 1941 until her death at age 68. They had three daughters: Jane, Terry, and Susan. His daughter, Susan, was an artist in the San Francisco counter-culture and co-founder of the Kerista Commune.

Furchgott spent his later years with Margaret Gallagher Roth, who died March 14, 2006. He served as a professor emeritus at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. In 2008, he moved to Seattle&#x27;s Ravenna neighborhood.

==Death==
Furchgott died on May 19, 2009, in Seattle. He is survived by his three daughters, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

<text>Royal Air Force Lossiemouth or more commonly RAF Lossiemouth is a military airfield located on the western edge of the town of Lossiemouth in Moray, north-east Scotland.

Lossiemouth is one of the largest and busiest fast-jet stations in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and known for its close proximity to flight training areas in Scotland and its favourable local flying conditions. Since the closure of RAF Leuchars in 2015, Lossiemouth is the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 in the United Kingdom. It is home to four front-line fast jet units which operate the Typhoon: No. 1 Squadron, No. 2 Squadron, No. 6 Squadron and No. 9 Squadron. All four Squadrons contribute to the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North capability which provides continuous protection of UK airspace. 

The station is also home to No. 120 Squadron and No. 201 Squadron, both flying the Poseidon MRA1 in the maritime patrol role. No. 8 Squadron will operate the RAF&#x27;s new fleet of three Boeing Wedgetail AEW1 airborne early warning and control aircraft, with aircrew training expected to commence in 2025. No. 42 Squadron is the operational conversion unit for the Poseidon and Wedgetail. There are a number of non-flying units at RAF Lossiemouth including No. 5 Force Protection Wing and an RAF Mountain Rescue Service team.

The airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF, predominantly as part of Bomber Command, until 1946 when it transferred to the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and became known as RNAS Lossiemouth or HMS &quot;Fulmar&quot;. Lossiemouth was used as a training station by the FAA until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has largely operated as a fast-jet base.

==History==
=== Construction (1938–1939) ===
Construction started during the summer of 1938, when of agricultural land was acquired to accommodate the airfield. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. Group Captain P.E Maitland was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939. The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was No. 15 Flying Training School (No. 15 FTS), initially equipped with thirteen Airspeed Oxfords and five Hawker Harts. Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, a detachment of Seaforth Highlanders was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station, and anti-aircraft defences were installed. Flying activity increased, with No. 15 FTS receiving more Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the North American Harvard; eleven Fairey Battles were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve Vickers Wellington bombers belonging to No. 99 Squadron. They arrived in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German cruiser , which was operating between Iceland and the Shetland Isles. January 1940 saw detachments comprising Handley Page Hampdens from No. 44 Squadron and No. 50 Squadron arriving to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However, the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid-February.

A detachment of No. 9 Squadron spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940, before being replaced by No. 107 Squadron and No. 110 Squadron, both equipped with Bristol Blenheims. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway.

It soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth, and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate No. 15 FTS to RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit&#x27;s departure, Lossiemouth transferred to No. 6 Group of RAF Bomber Command and No. 20 Operational Training Unit (No. 20 OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and Avro Ansons.

No. 46 Maintenance Unit (No. 46 MU) was also formed in April 1940. No. 46 MU&#x27;s role was to modify and fit out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced, including Hawker Hurricanes, de Havilland Tiger Moths, Hawker Audaxes, and a de Havilland Hornet Moth. The unit primarily used six Robin and eight Super Robin hangars; however, due to a shortage of space, many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station. Lossiemouth&#x27;s first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne to the south and known as RAF Elgin, opened in June 1940.

One officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for the first time. The attack by three Heinkel He 111 bombers resulted in the destruction of two Blenheims and damage to two Miles Magisters, two Tiger Moths and a Hurricane. Three hangars were also damaged, the resultant holes from cannon fire still visible today. One of the Heinkels crashed on the airfield, having either been hit by ground fire or destroyed by its own bombs. All four of the crew are buried in a Lossiemouth churchyard. As a result of the raid, Hurricanes of No. 232 Squadron were deployed to RAF Elgin to protect the area from attacks.

Flying activity in early 1941 was limited due to the poor condition of the airfield; however improved weather in the Spring increased activity from No. 20 OTU and No. 46 MU, as well as from continued bomber detachments. Operational sorties were predominately undertaken by Blenheims of No. 21 Squadron, No. 82 Squadron, No. 110 Squadron and No. 114 Squadron. By the winter of 1941, the airfield had become so muddy that the Wellingtons of No. 20 OTU were temporarily relocated to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. The increased activity by No. 46 MU resulted in two satellite landing grounds (SLG) being established to store aircraft off-site. These were at RAF Black Isle (No. 42 SLG) where Bristol Beaufighters were kept and RAF Leanach (No. 43 SLG) near Culloden, where Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires were stored.

Lossiemouth was used during 1942 as a base to launch several unsuccessful missions to sink the German battleship , which at the time was operating in Norwegian fjords. The first missions were undertaken in January 1942 by a detachment of thirteen Short Stirlings of No. 15 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron and thirteen Handley Page Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron and No. 76 Squadron. Further attempts were made during April by Avro Lancasters of No. 44 Squadron and No. 97 Squadron and Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron. Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron later joined the operation. 1942 also saw numerous accidents involving No. 20 OTU aircraft, many of which resulted in death and serious injuries. These accidents were attributed to a combination of fatigued aircraft, inexperienced crews and poor weather. Wellingtons of No. 20 OTU were also involved in strategic bombing raids on German cities throughout 1942, the training aircraft being required to help reach the target number of 1,000 bombers per raid. The airfield&#x27;s first surfaced runways, (06/24 ; 09/27 ; 01/19 ), were constructed by an engineering battalion of the US Army Air Force in late 1942 and helped to reduce interruptions to flying as a result of the grass strips being affected by poor weather. A new control tower was also constructed.

In September 1943, Wellingtons of &#x27;C&#x27; Flight No. 20 OTU, moved to the second of the Lossiemouth satellite airfields, RAF Milltown, located to the south-east. By now No. 46 MU were concentrating their work on Bristol Beaufighters and Lancasters and the SLG at RAF Leanach had been replaced with a new site at Dornoch golf course, which became known as RAF Dornoch (No. 40 SLG). No. 20 OTU received its official crest in 1943, with two examples cast in concrete being constructed at Lossiemouth and RAF Elgin. The crest at Lossiemouth no longer exists and although little now remains of the airfield at Elgin, the concrete crest is a war memorial for those who served there.

Further operations against &quot;Tirpitz&quot; took place between September and November 1944. Operation Catechism finally resulted in the German battleship being sunk near Tromsø on 12 November 1944. Thirty-eight Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron launched from Lossiemouth, Kinloss and Milltown and destroyed the vessel with Tallboy bombs. Nearly 50 years later, No. 617 Squadron transferred to Lossiemouth and was based there between 1993 and 2014. During that time examples of the Tallboy, Grand Slam and Up Keep (bouncing bomb) were on display within the squadron site.

In July 1945, after the end of hostilities in Europe, No. 20 OTU was disbanded and No. 46 MU continued to prepare aircraft for operations in the Far East. After the war ended, No. 46 MU began the enormous task of breaking-up surplus aircraft for scrap. At one point there were around 900 aircraft on the airfield awaiting disposal. On 28 July 1945, Lossiemouth was transferred to No. 17 Group of RAF Coastal Command, with the arrival of No. 111 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit from the Bahamas occurring shortly thereafter. By August 1945, the unit was operating forty-one Consolidated Liberators, ten Halifaxes and a North American Mitchell. The unit was disbanded in July 1946.

=== HMS &quot;Fulmar&quot; (1946–1972) ===
Lossiemouth transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) on 2 July 1946 and became known as Royal Navy Air Station (RNAS) Lossiemouth or HMS &quot;Fulmar&quot;. On the FAA taking control, No. 46 MU moved to RAF Elgin. Lossiemouth was used as a basic training station for FAA pilots who then moved on to RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;) in Cornwall for instrument training. RAF Milltown also transferred to the FAA and became known as HMS &quot;Fulmar II&quot;. It operated as a Deck Landing Training School, where the last stage of training was practised before students could land on in the Moray Firth. The first FAA squadron, No. 766 Naval Air Squadron, arrived at Lossiemouth in August 1946 and operated Supermarine Seafires and Fairey Fireflies until its departure to RNAS Culdrose in 1953. In the late 1940s, to replace poor quality war-era facilities, seven hundred new married living-quarters were constructed in the nearby towns of Lossiemouth and Elgin, with the first opening in September 1949. The practice of constructing living-quarters off-station differed from that of the RAF, which typically constructed such accommodation within the boundaries of their airfields. In 1952 and early 1953, Lossiemouth&#x27;s runways were upgraded and extended to their present lengths; during that time aircraft temporarily operated from Milltown.

The Naval Air Fighter and Strike Training School transferred to the station in 1953 and over the next decade many aircraft types operated from Lossiemouth in the training role, including Supermarine Seafires, Fairey Fireflys, Hawker Sea Hawks, Hawker Sea Furys, Supermarine Scimitars, de Havilland Sea Venoms and Hawker Hunters. Four Gloster Meteors were used as target-towers. One of the first squadrons of the recently established Federal Germany Navy was formed at Lossiemouth in May 1958 under the NATO cooperative policy. No. 764 Naval Air Squadron had responsibility for training German crews on twelve Sea Hawks, which operated in German Navy markings. A commissioning ceremony was attended by British and German naval and political figures. In 1958 it was announced that station facilities were to be upgraded at a cost of £3 million, including the refurbishment of living accommodation and the creation of the &quot;Fulmar Club&quot; social club. Princess Alexandra opened a new officers mess in July 1965.

The Blackburn Buccaneer arrived in March 1961 when No. 700Z Naval Air Squadron was created as an Intensive Flying Trials unit to evaluate the aircraft&#x27;s weapons, systems and performance. Initially, the squadron operated two aircraft, increasing to five by the end of 1961. The first operational Buccaneer squadron, No. 801 Naval Air Squadron, was established on 17 July 1962, followed by No. 809 Naval Air Squadron in January 1963 and No. 800 Naval Air Squadron in March 1964. The Buccaneer was capable of delivering nuclear weapons as well as conventional weapons for anti-shipping warfare and was typically active over the North Sea during its service. Buccaneers also embarked on aircraft carriers , , and . On 28 March 1967, Buccaneers from Lossiemouth bombed the shipwrecked supertanker off the western coast of Cornwall, to ignite the oil and avoid an environmental disaster. The mid-1960s saw further investment in facilities at Lossiemouth including new living quarters and messes.

The 1966 Defence White Paper saw the withdrawal of most British military forces stationed East of Suez during the 1970s, reducing the need for aircraft carriers and fixed-wing naval aviation such as the Buccaneer. The aircraft had been considered by the RAF for a medium-range interdictor and tactical strike aircraft. As a result, No. 736 Naval Air Squadron began training RAF air and ground crews on the Buccaneer in 1969. Between September 1967 and March 1970, the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s most decorated pilot, Captain Eric &#x27;Winkle&#x27; Brown was station commander; it was his last command. The late 1960s saw the FAA reduce its activities at Lossiemouth, although Fairey Gannets of No. 849 Naval Air Squadron were transferred from RNAS Brawdy to Lossiemouth on 13 November 1971. The Buccaneer force was reduced in size with several squadrons departing or disbanding in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The last Buccaneers, of No. 809 Naval Air Squadron, left on 25 September 1972, leaving the only Fleet Air Arm aircraft left being the Gannets and search and rescue helicopters.

=== Return of the Royal Air Force (1972–1991) ===

The station was returned to Royal Air Force control on 28 September 1972, with the first RAF squadron operating from the new RAF Lossiemouth being &#x27;D&#x27; Flight, No. 202 Squadron in the helicopter search and rescue role. The Jaguar Conversion Team arrived in May 1973 to train the RAF&#x27;s first SEPECAT Jaguar crews. It was later designated No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit on 1 October 1974. By late 1974, No. 6 Squadron and No. 54 Squadron were both operating the Jaguar.

In August 1973, No. 8 Squadron and their twelve Avro Shackleton AEW.2s, operating as airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft, moved to Lossiemouth from nearby RAF Kinloss. The Shackleton was an interim aircraft for the RAF AEW requirement, which saw the gradual replacement of Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Fairey Gannets, culminating in the disbandment of No. 849 Naval Air Squadron in November 1978. Towards the end of the 1970s, two non-flying defence units took up residence at the station, starting with the arrival in December 1978 of No. 48 Squadron RAF Regiment equipped with Rapier surface-to-air missiles. July 1979 saw the formation of No. 2622 (Highland) Royal Air Force Auxiliary Regiment for ground defence. From 1978 to 1980, No. 2 Tactical Weapons Unit operated the Hawker Hunter from Lossiemouth.

The Buccaneer made a return to Lossiemouth in the 1980s as a RAF maritime strike aircraft, the first arriving in November 1980 when No. 12 Squadron transferred from RAF Honington in Suffolk, followed by No. 208 Squadron in July 1983. The remainder of the RAF Buccaneer fleet arrived in October 1984 when No. 237 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), took up residence. Although the Buccaneer training unit, No. 237 OCU also had a reserve role of overland laser designation in support of RAF Jaguars.

=== Operation Granby ===
During the 1991 Gulf War, personnel from all three Buccaneer squadrons took part in Operation Granby, the aircraft&#x27;s first combat operation. Following a short-notice decision to deploy to the Middle East, the first batch of six aircraft were brought to readiness in under 72 hours, including the adoption of desert-pink camouflage and additional war-time equipment. The first six aircraft departed from Lossiemouth for Muharraq in Bahrain at 04:00 on 26 January 1991. Twelve Buccaneers operated as laser designators and it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carrying a Pave Spike laser designator pod, one as a spare in case of equipment failure. The Buccaneer force became known as the &quot;″Sky Pirates″&quot; in reference to the maritime history of the Buccaneer. Each aircraft had a Jolly Roger flag painted on its port side, alongside nose art featuring female characters. In recognition of their Scottish roots, the Buccaneers were also named after Speyside whisky such as &quot;Glenfiddich&quot;, &quot;Glen Elgin&quot; and &quot;The Macallan&quot;. Hostilities ended in late February 1991, the Buccaneers having flown 218 sorties without loss, designating targets for other aircraft and later dropping 48 of their own Paveway II laser-guided bombs.

=== Transition to Tornado (1991–1999) ===
The replacement for the ageing Shackleton AEW.2, the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW.3, suffered considerable development difficulties which culminated in the aircraft being cancelled during 1986, for an off-the-shelf purchase of the Boeing Sentry AEW1. The last Shackletons were retired in July 1991 and No. 8 Squadron transferred to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, to equip with their new aircraft.

It was intended that the Buccaneer would remain in service until the end of the 1990s, having been extensively modernised in a process lasting up to 1989; however the end of the Cold War resulted in major changes in British defence policy, with many aircraft being deemed surplus to requirements. As a consequence, to allow for the early retirement of the Buccaneer, twenty-six Panavia Tornado GR1s were modified to GR1B standard to allow the use of the BAe Sea Eagle missile for maritime strike operations. The reduction of the Buccaneer fleet began on 1 October 1991 when No. 237 OCU was disbanded, followed by No. 12 Squadron in September 1993. No. 27 Squadron, then at RAF Marham, disbanded and re-formed at Lossiemouth as No.12 Squadron, operating the Tornado GR1B.

In 1992, No. 237 Field Squadron of the Territorial Army was formed with responsibility for Airfield Damage Repair (ADR). This squadron became part of No. 76 Engineer Regiment (Volunteers) of the Royal Engineers, responsible for ADR in the north of England and across Scotland. The Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit, renamed No. 15 (Reserve) Squadron, arrived from RAF Honington in Suffolk on 1 November 1993. The last Buccaneers were withdrawn in April 1994 when No. 208 Squadron disbanded. No. 617 Squadron then transferred to Lossiemouth from RAF Marham in Norfolk, with its Tornado GR1Bs. No. 48 Squadron RAF Regiment and their Rapiers left Lossiemouth for RAF Honington on 1 July 1996. Group Captain Graham Miller was station commander between 1995 and 1998 and later achieved the rank of Air Marshal, holding the post of Deputy Commander at Allied Joint Force Command in Naples from 2004 until his retirement in 2008.

After the closure of the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE) at RAF Cottesmore in 1999, the number of aircraft operated by No. 15 (R) Squadron increased. The squadron became the RAF Tornado GR4 Operational Conversion Unit, training pilots and weapon systems operators for posting to front-line Tornado squadrons at Lossiemouth and RAF Marham. The squadron accepted aircrew straight from advanced flying training at RAF Leeming and RAF Valley and provided refresher courses for experienced aircrew returning to the Tornado GR4, following other tours of duty. The squadron also trained aircrew officers from foreign nations posted to the UK on two to three-year exchange tours.

=== 21st century ===

To concentrate the Jaguar fleet in one place, No. 16(R) Squadron with eleven aircraft and around 100 personnel departed Lossiemouth for RAF Coltishall in Norfolk in July 2000, bringing to an end Lossiemouth&#x27;s 27-year association with the Jaguar. After the arrival of No. 14 Squadron and its Tornado GR1s from RAF Brüggen in Germany during January 2001, Lossiemouth became the busiest fast-jet station in the RAF. In May 2001, No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment was re-established, to join No. 2622 RAuxAF Squadron, under the new No. 5 Force Protection Wing Headquarters.

==== F-35 Lightning II and threat of closure ====
The Ministry of Defence announced in November 2005 that Lossiemouth would be the main operating base for the RAF&#x27;s new F-35 Lightning II fleet, which was expected to enter service in 2013. In 2010, the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) cast doubt on whether the F-35 would be based at Lossiemouth and raised fears in the local community that the station could close. On 7 November 2010 up to 7,000 people took part in a march and rally in Lossiemouth in support of retaining the RAF station, including Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Alex Salmond and other politicians. With Moray being the area in Scotland most dependent on military spending, it was feared the closure of RAF Lossiemouth and the confirmed closure of nearby RAF Kinloss, would lead to economic uncertainty and unemployment. A petition with more than 30,000 signatures was delivered to 10 Downing Street by campaign members on 11 January 2011.

In July 2011, the Ministry of Defence announced that Lossiemouth would remain open with Lossiemouth&#x27;s Tornados moving to RAF Marham. RAF Leuchars in Fife would close and transfer to the British Army, with Leuchar&#x27;s Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4s and responsibility for Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North (QRA) moving to Lossiemouth. In March 2013, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the F-35 Lighting II would be based at Marham.

====From Tornado to Typhoon====

After the SDSR, No. 14 Squadron disbanded on 1 June 2011, reducing the number of Tornados based at Lossiemouth. In 2012, a new combined mess for junior ranks and senior non-commission officers was completed, replacing separate buildings constructed in the 1960s, which were demolished.

Following the announcement in 2011 that Lossiemouth would remain open, £17 million was spent in 2013 refurbishing the airfield for the arrival of the Typhoon, with a further £70 million set aside for future developments. Quick Reaction Alert facilities were built in the northern hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) complex and alterations were made to hangars 1 and 3 and new ground-support IT and communication systems. In March 2014, three Typhoons from RAF Leuchars arrived at Lossiemouth to take part in &quot;Exercise Moray Venture&quot;, a week-long operation to test new facilities ahead of the aircraft&#x27;s arrival later that year.
In preparation for the transition to the Typhoon, No.12 Squadron and No.617 Squadron disbanded on 1 April 2014, leaving No.15 (R) Squadron as the only remaining Tornado unit at Lossiemouth. The first Typhoon unit, No. 6 Squadron, transferred from RAF Leuchars to Lossiemouth on 20 June 2014. Nine aircraft arrived in formation in the shape of a number 6. No. 1 Squadron followed on 8 September 2014, when responsibility for Quick Reaction Alert (North) was transferred from RAF Leuchars to Lossiemouth.

The third Typhoon squadron based at Lossiemouth, No. 2 Squadron, arrived in January 2015. In preparation of the squadron&#x27;s arrival, work commenced in October 2014 to refurbish the southern HAS complex, which was formerly occupied by No. 617 Squadron. Nine aircraft shelters were refurbished, a hard-standing for a flight-line capable of accommodating eight aircraft was built, new flood-lighting was installed and the dining facilities were improved. A new headquarters building was constructed on the site of a World War II era K-type hangar (K20). The building has space for engineering and logistics facilities, a survival equipment section, classrooms and office space. This allowed No. 2 Squadron to operate independently from other squadrons at Lossiemouth.

In May 2015, construction began on a new section of taxiway to provide improved access between the QRA facilities in the northern HAS site and runway 23/05. The new taxiway was constructed by 53 Field Squadron, part of 39 (Air Support) Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, based at nearby Kinloss Barracks. The project was completed in September 2015.

No. 15 (R) Squadron disbanded on 31 March 2017. Aircraft and crews were absorbed into front-line squadrons at RAF Marham where refresher training on the Tornado was carried out. To mark the occasion, on 17 March 2017, five Tornados from the squadron carried out a flypast of the former RAF base at Leuchars, the weapons range at RAF Tain and Aberdeen International Airport, before performing a simulated airfield strike on RAF Lossiemouth in front of base personnel, families and friends. A disbandment parade was held on 31 March 2017, signifying the end of twenty-four years of Tornado operations at Lossiemouth. Over 750 current and former squadron personnel attended the ceremony where the &quot;Sands of Kuwait&quot;, a tune written to commemorate the 1991 Gulf War (the squadron&#x27;s last battle honour), was played on the bagpipes and a Tornado fly-past took place.

The final infrastructure required to support the Typhoons was completed in June 2017, when Rolls-Royce opened its Typhoon Propulsion Support Facility; this is operated by a combination of civilian and RAF personnel and provides engineering support for Typhoon Eurojet EJ200 engines.

On 4 March 2016 Lossiemouth was announced as the preferred option to accommodate an additional Typhoon squadron and 400 personnel. Four Typhoon FGR4s were assigned to No. 9 Squadron (Designate) at Lossiemouth in February 2019. The unit re-equipped as an aggressor and air defence squadron operating Typhoon Tranche 1 on 1 April 2019, thereby continuing in unbroken service upon the Tornado&#x27;s retirement at RAF Marham.

==== End of search and rescue (SAR) operations ====

In 2006, the government announced its intentions to privatise the RAF Search and Rescue (SAR) Force. In March 2013, a £1.6 billion ten-year contract to run the search and rescue service with new AgustaWestland AW189 and Sikorsky S-92 helicopters was agreed with Bristow Helicopters in March 2013. SAR helicopter operations in the north-east of Scotland ceased at Lossiemouth and moved to Inverness Airport, located to the west. &#x27;D&#x27; flight of No. 202 Squadron disbanded on 1 April 2015 and its Sea King HAR3s were stored at RAF Valley, Anglesey, bringing nearly 43 years of search and rescue operations at Lossiemouth to an end. The Sea Kings had been a familiar sight in the skies above Scotland, having been involved in the Piper Alpha disaster, Lockerbie bombing and appearing in local and national media.

A farewell party to be held by &#x27;D&#x27; Flight personnel to thank the local community for their support, was cancelled by RAF officials. There was widespread criticism of the decision but the RAF considered that the event could contravene campaigning rules for the UK general election, as it could be perceived as being political. Morayvia, a local charity bought the former Lossiemouth Sea King &#x27;XZ592&#x27; from the Ministry of Defence in March 2015. The aircraft is now on display as part of Morayvia&#x27;s Science and Technology Experience Project at Kinloss.

In March 2015, the UK government ruled out Lossiemouth as well as nearby RAF Kinloss as candidates for a new spaceport due to opposition from the Ministry of Defence, which cited over-riding operational factors. The decision was criticised by local politicians.

==== Arrival of Poseidon ====
On 23 November 2015, the UK announced its intention to order nine new Boeing MRA1 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. In June 2017, it was announced that No. 120 Squadron would be the first Poseidon squadron. The unit reformed in early 2018 and by February 2019 air and ground crews from the unit and the Poseidon Line Squadron had commenced training with the US Navy at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.

To provide the infrastructure to support the Poseidon, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation launched the Lossiemouth Development Programme in October 2016. The programme involved £350 million being invested in RAF Lossiemouth to upgrade buildings and airfield infrastructure to allow No. 9 Squadron and the Poseidon fleet to operate from Lossiemouth. Projects included:

* Construction of a new hangar and support facility for the Poseidon fleet, known as the Poseidon Strategic Facility, begun in April 2018 and was completed in July 2020. The facility was built on the northern side of the airfield and includes maintenance facilities capable of accommodating three aircraft simultaneously, a tactical operations centre, training &amp; simulation facilities and accommodation for two squadrons. The building was constructed by Robertson Group with a contract value of £132m. In August 2021, it was named the &#x27;Atlantic Building&#x27;, reflecting its maritime warfare role.

* As Lossiemouth&#x27;s airfield was largely set-up for fast-jet operations, the runways and associated operating surfaces required resurfacing and alterations to safely accommodate regular Poseidon operations. Work on the £75 million contract commenced in May 2020, with the airfield being closed between 10 August and 16 October 2020 whilst the intersection of the two runways was resurfaced. During the closure, routine Typhoon training operations were relocated to the airfield at Kinloss Barracks and the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Force for the north of the UK temporarily relocated to Leuchars Station. 
* Construction of a new Crash, Fire and Rescue building to replace the existing building dating from the 1960s was completed in November 2022. Alongside the introduction of Oshkosh Striker fire fighting vehicles, the new facilities for the Defence Fire and Rescue Service provide the increased level of emergency cover required by the larger aircraft operating from Lossiemouth.
* Seven new single living accommodation blocks were constructed to provide 426 en-suite bedrooms, with the final blocking being completed in April 2024. Each block is named after a former RAF airfield in the north east of Scotland: Brackla, Dalcross, Dallachy, Dyce, Inverness, Milltown and Peterhead.
* New waste water treatment plant, drainage and utility infrastructure.
The RAF&#x27;s first Poseidon arrived in the UK from the US in February 2020, initially operating from Kinloss. It was later joined by a second aircraft before both moved to their new home at Lossiemouth in October 2020. The fleet was completed in January 2022 when the ninth aircraft was delivered to Lossiemouth. No. 201 Squadron reformed at Lossiemouth during 2021 as the second unit operating the Poseidon, sharing the fleet with No. 120 Squadron.

A basing agreement between the UK and US governments was reached in 2017 to allow the US Navy to routinely operate their own Poseidons from Lossiemouth. To facilitate the arrangement, the US Department of Defense contributed £60m ($m) to the Lossiemouth Development Programme, including towards the runway and apron works. A hangar wash facility and austere barracks for the US Navy were opened in May 2024, which are operated by Commander Task Force 67 (CTF-67), part of the navy&#x27;s Sixth Fleet.

In October 2024, as part of a wider defence agreement between Germany and the UK, it was announced that German Navy Poesidons will periodically operate from Lossiemouth whilst conducting patrols of the North Atlantic.

== Facilities ==

The RAF Lossiemouth site extends to and accommodates two runways, the main runway (05/23) is long and the secondary runway (10/28) is long. Hangars at Lossiemouth date from the Second World War and comprise three C-type, one J-type, six L-type, four K-type and a Bellman type. The northern HAS complex has nine shelters and QRA facilities and the southern complex has a further nine shelters. Both HAS complexes were constructed in the 1970s.
The airfield boundary has changed over the years and several former Super Robin hangars, dating from the Second World War are outside the current airfield boundary, although they are no longer in military use. An example is within the grounds of Gordounston School. Former airfield dispersals are also evident in the same vicinity. During the Second World War the airfield was defended with eight pillboxes, at least six of them Type 27 pillboxes, one rectangular and the other Type 22 or Type 24.

BAE Systems operates the Typhoon Training Facility (North), which is home to four Emulated Deployable Cockpit Trainer (EDCT) flight simulators. The expansion of the facility from two to four EDCTs was completed in April 2018. During the Tornado&#x27;s tenure at Lossiemouth, the station was home to two Tornado GR4 flight simulators, operated by Thales UK.

Aviation fuel is supplied to Lossiemouth through a -stretch of the CLH Pipeline System which connects the airfield to a fuel depot in Inverness.

== Role and operations ==
RAF Lossiemouth&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;Sustain Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North and deliver global operations&quot;.

The Engineering &amp; Logistics Wing is responsible for maintaining engineering support and supply including weapons and survival equipment on aircraft. It is also responsible for the maintenance and repair of aircraft not currently flying on squadrons and the station support equipment and vehicles. The Operations Wing plans and controls all flying and major exercises on station and manages all activities that have a direct impact on flying operations. This includes intelligence gathering, weather forecasting and communications systems. The Base Support Wing manages all support functions for the station&#x27;s infrastructure and personnel, such as health and safety, medical centre, non-flying training, accommodation, family support and the deployment of Station personnel.

Moray Flight of No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) was established in 2013 to support NATO maritime patrol aircraft and the UK Maritime Air Operations Centre when deployed to Lossiemouth. The unit is also supporting the introduction of the P-8A Poseidon at Lossiemouth.

RAF Lossiemouth is the parent station of Tain Air Weapons Range which is located approximately to the north west.

With the closure of nearby RAF Kinloss and the transfer of the station to the British Army in July 2012, the RAF Kinloss Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) became the RAF Lossiemouth MRT. The team continued to operate from their purpose-built base at Kinloss Barracks for over two years, until they moved into a &#x27;D&#x27; Flight No. 202 Squadron hangar in February 2015.

=== Command ===
Group Captain Sarah Brewin was appointed as the Station Commander of RAF Lossiemouth on 19 July 2024, taking over from Group Captain Jim Lee.

In July 2017 a spaniel named Dee was made the official station mascot and given the rank of Sergeant. Dee is a former RAF Police working dog and specialised in explosives detection. He retired from operational duties when his leg was amputated as a result of an injury.

=== Typhoon operations ===

The Typhoon FGR4 provides the RAF with a multi-role combat capability for air policing, peace support and high intensity conflict. Lossiemouth Typhoon squadrons have operated against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Shader and have participated in the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission where they operated from Ämari air base in Estonia.

Lossiemouth&#x27;s four Typhoon squadrons are responsible for maintaining the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North mission (QRA(I)N). Aircraft and crews are held at a high state of readiness, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to respond to unidentified aircraft approaching UK airspace. QRA missions range from civilian airliners which have stopped responding to air traffic control, to intercepting Russian aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack.

=== No. 5 Force Protection Wing ===

No. 5 Force Protection Wing HQ provides operational planning, command and control to two RAF Regiment field squadrons attached to the wing, No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment and No. 2622 (Highland) Squadron&#x27;s (RAuxAF), whose purpose is to protect RAF bases at home and abroad from ground attack. No. 2622 Squadron consists primarily of RAF Regiment gunners also trained as infantry and has a limited number of personnel in support duties. The unit provides officers and gunners to supplement the regular RAF Regiment on overseas operations and exercises. It is the only squadron in the RAF or RAuxAF to have its own Pipes and Drums band, which formed in 1999 and is open to both Service and civilian members. It is also the only operational squadron to have spent its existence based at Lossiemouth. Both squadrons have seen action on Operation Telic in Iraq and Operation Herrick in Afghanistan, with No. 51 Squadron also involved in Operation Shader against ISIS.

No. 4 RAF Police Squadron also falls under the command of the wing and has responsibility for policing and security in Scotland and northern England.

=== Air Training Corps – North Scotland Wing ===
Lossiemouth is home to the North Scotland Wing of the Air Training Corps. A new Air Cadet Regional Centre was opened in October 2014, which contains the Highland Wing headquarters, activity centre with a flight simulator, radio communications training room, IT Suite and several briefing rooms. Overnight residential accommodation for 48 cadets and 8 adult staff is also provided. The centre was named after and opened by retired Group Captain Phil Dacre.

=== E-7 Wedgetail ===
In December 2020, the RAF announced that its new fleet of Boeing E-7 Wedgetail AEW1 aircraft were to be based at Lossiemouth. The Airborne early warning and control aircraft will replace the E-3D Sentry AEW1 fleet which was retired in 2021 and was operated by No. 8 Squadron at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. As of early 2023, the arrival date for the aircraft had been delayed to 2024.

The construction of technical facilities to support Wedgetail operations started in October 2022. Two new single living accommodation blocks, to be named Tain and Alness, are to be planned.

== Heritage ==

=== Station badge and motto ===
RAF Lossiemouth&#x27;s badge, awarded in May 1974, features a snowy owl facing forwards with expanded wings pointed downwards. The owl sits on two crossed claymore swords. The snowy owl can be found in Scotland and compared to humans have a well-developed ability to see at night. This symbolised the use radar for the airborne early warning mission carried out by No. 8 Squadron which was based at Lossiemouth when the badge was awarded. The owl also reflects the wisdom being provided by the Jaguar Operational Conversion Unit at the time. The claymores, a type of historic Scottish sword, represent the location of the station in Scotland and the potential for attack.

The station&#x27;s motto, , translates from Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Be careful&quot;.

== Community relations and media ==

The RAF and local community of Moray enjoy good relations, as demonstrated in 1992 by the station receiving the Freedom of Moray from the then Moray District Council. The freedom was granted in recognition of the role RAF Lossiemouth has played in the defence of the nation and in particular, the greatly valued contribution which has been made by the station to the day-to-day life of Moray. The connections between RAF Lossiemouth and Moray were further strengthened on the signing of the Armed Forces Covenant between Moray Council, other community partners and the RAF in 2012 and again in 2016. The co-operation was recognised in November 2016 when the Ministry of Defence awarded Moray Council an award for its supportive attitude towards the armed forces. The RAF contributes to the local community in spending, employment and activities in the wider community. In 2010, Highlands and Islands Enterprise wrote that RAF Lossiemouth contributed £90.3m to the local economy and supported 3,370 jobs in Moray.

The RAF organise the annual charity Lossiemouth Raft Race, in which military and civilian teams race home-made rafts along the River Lossie, adjacent to Lossiemouth&#x27;s East Beach. The race was established in 1976 and is attended by thousands of onlookers. A Family and Friends Day also takes place where military families and civilians with connections to the station are invited to a small air-show, held each May. The RAF have also provided photo opportunities for aviation enthusiasts during exercises such as Joint Warrior.

The RAF Lossiemouth station magazine is called the &quot;Lossie Lighthouse&quot;, in reference to the nearby Covesea Skerries Lighthouse. The magazine is distributed to station personnel, their families and the local community. It is also available online at the RAF Lossiemouth web page.

RAF Lossiemouth has featured in several television and radio documentaries –
* &quot;Shackleton – The End of an Era&quot; was a 1984 programme produced for Granada TV examining the history of the Shackleton aircraft and featuring No. 8 Squadron whilst at Lossiemouth.
* &quot;The Old Grey Ladies of Lossiemouth&quot; produced by Grampian TV, captured the final months of Shackleton operations in 1990 before their withdrawal from service.
* &quot;Rescue&quot; was a thirteen part series which followed the Sea Kings of No. 202 Squadron &#x27;D&#x27; Flight for a year and was shown on Grampian TV in 1990.
* &quot;″Gloria Hunniford at RAF Lossiemouth″&quot; was a BBC Radio 2 programme broadcast in 1993 in which TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford talked to personnel from Lossiemouth and accompanied a helicopter crew on an air sea rescue training exercise.
* &quot;JetSet&quot; was a six-part series produced by STV in 2006 which followed trainee Tornado GR4 crews as they passed through a six-month operational conversion course with No.15 Squadron. The programme was narrated by Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, whose brother Colin McGregor was a Tornado pilot at Lossiemouth prior to his retirement in 2007.
* &quot;Top Guns: Inside the RAF&quot; is six-part series that first aired on Channel 4 in 2023, featuring RAF Lossiemouth&#x27;s crucial role in safeguarding the UK’s airspace and seas.

<text>Royal Air Force Cottesmore or more simply RAF Cottesmore is a former Royal Air Force station in Rutland, England, situated between Cottesmore and Market Overton. On 15 December 2009, Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth announced that the station would close in 2013 as part of defence spending cuts, along with the retirement of the Harrier GR9 and the disbandment of Joint Force Harrier. The formal closing ceremony took place on 31 March 2011, and the airfield became a satellite of RAF Wittering until March 2012.

In July 2011 Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced plans for it to be the airfield for one of five of the Army&#x27;s Multi-Role Brigades. In April 2012 it was renamed Kendrew Barracks after Major General Sir Douglas Kendrew.

==Station badge==
The badge of RAF Cottesmore consisted of a hunting horn, a five-pointed star and a horseshoe. The description is &quot;in front of a horseshoe a mullet overall a hunting horn in bend&quot;. The hunting horn symbolises the location in foxhunting country and the link with the Cottesmore Hunt; the American Star recalls the time the Station was a United States Army Air Force base; the inverted horseshoe is a traditional emblem of Oakham and the County of Rutland.

The motto &quot;We rise to our obstacles&quot; is both a reference to the Cottesmore Hunt and was intended to convey the spirit with which the Royal Air Force confronts difficulties. The badge was granted in 1948.

The badge appears on the nameplate of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado steam locomotive that was named by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on 19 February 2009.

==History==

===Royal Air Force===
RAF Cottesmore opened on 11 March 1938. The station was used mainly for training, and the first squadrons were equipped with Vickers Wellesley aircraft, but soon converted to Fairey Battles. Later RAF Bomber Command took over the airfield, again as a training station, flying Handley Page Hampdens.

These units remained in residence until a few days before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 when they were sent to RAF Cranfield to serve as a pool providing replacements for combat losses. Their place at Cottesmore was taken by Nos. 106 and 185 Squadrons, moving in from RAF Thornaby with Hampdens.

However, with the outbreak of war, the aircraft and crews were sent to locations in the north and west, as enemy air attacks were expected over the southern half of England. As these never materialised, the Hampdens returned in the spring of 1940 and No. 185 Squadron became the Hampden operational training unit, No. 14 Operational Training Unit RAF.

Cottesmore&#x27;s Hampdens&#x27; first entry into hostile airspace was a leaflet dropping operation over northern France. In October 1940, 106 Squadron moved to RAF Finningley while No. 14 OTU remained training crews for Bomber Command, its Hampdens and Handley Page Herefords being replaced by Vickers Wellingtons in 1942. Training continued for three years and three months until August 1943 when No. 14 OTU moved to RAF Market Harborough.

In May 1943, No. 34 Heavy Glider Maintenance Section arrived, and was present until March 1944.

===United States Army Air Forces===
On 8 September 1943 the United States Army Air Forces took the facilities over, under the designation USAAF Station 489, flying troop transport aircraft. In anticipation of the station&#x27;s future use by airborne forces, 32 Airspeed Horsa gliders were delivered for storage in July 1943.
The 316th Troop Carrier Group began to arrive at Cottesmore on 15 February 1944 when 52 Douglas C-47 Skytrain and Douglas C-53 Skytrooper transports began flying in from Borizzo Airfield, Sicily. Flying squadrons and fuselage codes of the group were:
* 36th Troop Carrier Squadron (4C)
* 37th Troop Carrier Squadron (W7)
* 44th Troop Carrier Squadron (6E)
* 45th Troop Carrier Squadron (T3)

The 316th TCG was part of the 52d Troop Carrier Wing.

===Post-war===
Cottesmore was officially handed back to the RAF on 1 July 1945. It became a training station, hosting No. 7 Flying Training School RAF with Percival Prentice basic training aircraft and the North American Harvard trainer for advanced training – later replaced by the Boulton Paul Balliol which had a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. No. 16 Operational Training Unit RAF was present between 1 March 1946 and 15 March 1947.

In 1954 English Electric Canberras were moved in (No. 44 Squadron RAF and No. 57 Squadron RAF), the first time front-line combat aircraft had been based there, but all had left by the end of 1955.
In 1957, Cottesmore became home to aircraft of the V bombers, the UK&#x27;s strategic nuclear strike force. 
No. 10 Squadron RAF reformed at Cottesmore on 15 April 1958 flying the Handley Page Victor B.1 until disbandment on 1 March 1964. The squadrons carried out Quick Reaction Alert duties using Handley Page Victor and later Avro Vulcan bombers until 1969. 

&quot;C&quot; Flight, No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit RAF, was present from 1 November 1961 to 1 April 1962, at which point the Victor Training Flight stayed until 31 March 1964.

After the V-Bombers left, the base was used by 90 Signals Group. Flight Checking, Trials and Evaluation Flight (FCTEF) used 98 Squadron (Canberras) and 115 Squadron (Vickers Varsity and Armstrong Whitworth Argosy) to provide ILS and radar trials and checking services to RAF airfields around the world. No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit moved into Cottesmore on 19 May 1969 equipped with Canberras, staying until 12 February 1976 when it moved to RAF Marham. No. 360 Squadron, an electronic countermeasures squadron flying Canberras, moved to RAF Cottesmore in April 1969. 360 Squadron moved in September 1975 to RAF Wyton.

In July 1980, Cottesmore became home to Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE). Officially opened on 29 January 1981, the centre undertook training of new Panavia Tornado aircrews from the RAF, German Air Force, Marineflieger (German Navy air arm) and Italian Air Force.

The TTTE closed in 1999, and after a period of refurbishment was replaced by the British Aerospace Harrier IIs of Nos 3 and 4 squadrons; these were later joined by 800 and 801 Naval Air Squadrons to form Joint Force Harrier (JFH).

With the introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon into RAF service, No. 3 Sqn moved to RAF Coningsby and No 1 Sqn moved from RAF Wittering. No. 122 Expeditionary Air Wing was also established at the station (2006–2011).

The following units were here at some point:
==Closure==
In early December 2009, the then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth announced the station would close due to funding cut-backs, in part to help pay for additional helicopters for British operations in Afghanistan.

In 2010, No. 4 Squadron RAF disbanded, with No. 20 Squadron RAF re-badging as No 4 (Reserve) Squadron.

The station became a satellite to RAF Wittering on 31 March 2011 with a civic parade and flypast to mark the disbandment of No 1 Sqn RAF, 800 NAS, 801 NAS and JFH. In July 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced that Cottesmore would house the Army&#x27;s East of England Multi-Role Brigade.

==Station commanders==
==Kendrew Barracks==

The Army officially took over the site in April 2012. It is now home to the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, who moved from Dhekelia Garrison in Cyprus. A second regiment, 7 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, moved to the base in 2013.

Kendrew Barracks was officially opened in October 2012 by the Duke of Gloucester.

<doc id="474997" wikidata="Q1074155" url="?curid=474997" title="Runaround (story)">
<text>&quot;Runaround&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov, featuring his recurring characters Powell and Donovan. It was written in October 1941 and first published in the March 1942 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. It appears in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990). In 2018, &quot;Runaround&quot; was nominated for a retrospective 1943 Hugo Award for best short story. The story features the first explicit appearance of the Three Laws of Robotics.

==Plot dilemma==
As in many of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; stories, conflicts in the application of the Three Laws of Robotics is the subject of the plot. In contrast to the majority of such stories, in which the lexical ambiguities of the Laws are employed to fashion a dilemma, the robot featured in &quot;Runaround&quot; is actually following the Laws as they were intended.

The plot revolves around the Three Laws of Robotics:
# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey the orders by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
The robot finds it impossible to obey both the Second Law and the Third Law at the same time, and this freezes it in a loop of repetitive behavior.

== Plot summary==
In 2015, Powell, Donovan and Robot SPD-13, also known as &quot;Speedy&quot;, are sent to Mercury to restart operations at a mining station which was abandoned ten years before.

They discover that their life support system is short on selenium and will soon fail. Donovan sends Speedy to a nearby selenium pool, but he does not return as expected. After scouting with a more primitive robot, they discover that Speedy is running in a huge circle around the selenium pool. When Speedy is asked to return with the selenium, he begins talking oddly, quoting Gilbert and Sullivan and showing symptoms that, if he were human, would be interpreted as drunkenness.

Powell eventually realizes that the selenium source contains unforeseen danger to the robot. Under normal circumstances, Speedy would observe the Second Law, but because Speedy was so expensive to manufacture, the Third Law had been strengthened. As the order to retrieve the selenium was casually worded with no particular emphasis, Speedy cannot decide whether to obey it, following the Second Law, or protect himself from danger, following the strengthened Third Law. The conflicting Laws cause what is basically a feedback loop which confuses him to oscillate around the point where the two compulsions are of equal strength, which makes Speedy appear inebriated.

Under the Second Law Speedy should obey Powell&#x27;s order to return to base, but that fails, as the conflicted positronic brain cannot accept new orders. An attempt to increase the compulsion of the Third Law also fails. They place oxalic acid, which can destroy Speedy, in his path, but it merely causes Speedy to change his route until he finds a new equilibrium between the avoid-danger law and the follow-order law.

The only thing that trumps &quot;both&quot; the Second Law and Third Law is the First Law of Robotics which states that &quot;a robot may not... allow a human being to come to harm.&quot; Therefore, Powell decides to risk his life by going out in the heat, hoping that the First Law will force Speedy to overcome his cognitive dissonance to save Powell&#x27;s life. The plan works, and the team is able to repair the photocell banks.

== Influences ==
Artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky said: &quot;After &#x27;Runaround&#x27; appeared in the March 1942 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; [now &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; ], I never stopped thinking about how minds might work.&quot;

<doc id="474998" wikidata="Q7275252" url="?curid=474998" title="RAF Coltishall">
<text>Royal Air Force Coltishall more commonly known as RAF Coltishall is a former Royal Air Force station located north-north-east of Norwich, in the English county of Norfolk, East Anglia, which operated from 1939 to 2006.

It was a fighter airfield in the Second World War and afterwards, a station for night fighters, then ground attack aircraft until closure.

After longstanding speculation, the future of the station was sealed once the Ministry of Defence announced that the Eurofighter Typhoon, a rolling replacement aircraft, displacing the ageing SEPECAT Jaguar, would not be located there. The last of the Jaguar squadrons left on 1 April 2006, and the station finally closed, one month early and £10 million under budget, on .

The station motto was &quot;Aggressive in Defence&quot;. The station badge was a stone tower surmounted by a mailed fist grasping three bind-bolts (blunt arrows), which symbolised a position of strength in defence of the homeland, indicative of the aggressive spirit which Coltishall fighter aircraft were prepared to shoot down the enemy.

==History==
===Second World War===
Work on RAF Coltishall was started in . The airfield, then known as Scottow Aerodrome, was initially built as a bomber station, on land near Scottow Hall. Following the established tradition, the station would have been named after the nearest railway station, which would have made it RAF Buxton, but to avoid possible confusion with the town of Buxton in Derbyshire, it was named after the local village of Coltishall instead. The airfield was completed and entered service in as a fighter base. The first aircraft movement at Coltishall was a Bristol Blenheim IV L7835 flown by Sergeant RG Bales and Sergeant Barnes.

During the Second World War, Coltishall operated the Hawker Hurricane. A notable Coltishall fighter pilot was Douglas Bader, appointed as leader of No. 242 Squadron, a mainly Canadian Hurricane squadron. They had suffered significant losses in the recent Battle of France, and he was credited with restoring their morale.

Coltishall later became home to night fighters. At the same time, the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm operated aircraft from RAF Coltishall over the North Sea. From 10 February to 7 April 1945, it was the airfield for No. 124 Squadron, at that time a fighter-bomber squadron flying Supermarine Spitfire IX.HF&#x27;s, whilst the squadron was bombing V-2 launch sites in the Netherlands. At the end of the war, Coltishall was briefly given over to Polish squadrons until they returned home.

===Cold War===
In the 1950s, RAF Coltishall was a designated a &#x27;V-bomber dispersal airfield&#x27;, which V bombers tasked with delivery of the British nuclear deterrent; the Avro Vulcan, Handley Page Victor, and Vickers Valiant, could use in the event of their home station being damaged by enemy action.

Postwar, the station was home to a variety of units and aircraft, including de Havilland Mosquitos, Gloster Javelins and, from 1963, the Historic Aircraft Flight (now known as the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight or BBMF). RAF Coltishall became home to the RAF&#x27;s first English Electric Lightning F.1s when No. 74 (Fighter) Squadron began to receive the jet in June 1960, after arriving the year before. No. 74 (F) Squadron relocated to RAF Leuchars in Scotland on 2 March 1964. No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) arrived at the base on 12 April 1964, tasked with training new pilots how to fly the Lightning. The last Lightnings left Coltishall in September 1974 when No. 266 OCU departed.

The Lightnings were replaced by the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1, with the first Jaguar unit, No. 54 (F) Squadron, arriving at Coltishall on 8 August 1974. They were soon joined by No. 6 Squadron who arrived at the base in November 1974, making the station exclusively home to the Jaguar in terms of fixed wing aircraft.
No. 41 (Designate) Squadron formed at RAF Coltishall on 1 October 1976, and worked up as a Jaguar unit until officially standing up on 1 April 1977, when the No. 41 Squadron operating the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2 at RAF Coningsby disbanded the previous day.

In 1991, elements of all three based Jaguar units; Nos. 6, 41 and 54 Squadrons, along with associated support personnel deployed to Muharraq Airfield, Bahrain, in preparation for Operation Granby due to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait.

Coltishall played host to several United States Air Force Coronet deployments during the Cold War:
*Coronet Heron – 12 to 23 June 1978 saw the deployment of 12 McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom IIs from the 62nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron.
*Coronet Joust – 23 June to 7 July 1983 saw the deployment of 12 RF-4C Phantom IIs from the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Alabama Air National Guard).
*Coronet Mobile – 13 to 26 September 1986 saw the deployment of 11 RF-4C Phantom IIs from the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Alabama Air National Guard).

===1991 to closure===
The Jaguars deployed again, this time to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to participate in Operation Warden which set up a no-fly zone over Iraq. Between 1993 and 1995, the Jaguars deployed to Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy, as part of Operation Deny Flight to enforce a no-fly zone over the Balkans. In 1997, No. 54 Squadron deployed to Italy once more in support of Operation Deliberate Guard. No. 6 Squadron deployed once again to Incirlik in 1998 as part of Operation Resinate.
On 21 July 2000, No. 16 (Reserve) Squadron, the Jaguar OCU, arrived at RAF Coltishall from RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. In December 2000, five Jaguars from No. 41 (F) Squadron deployed to Luleå Airport, Sweden, to train alongside Saab 37 Viggens of the Norrbotten Wing.

Coltishall was also home to the yellow search and rescue (SAR) helicopters of No. 202 Squadron tasked with conducting air-sea rescue operations (Westland Sea King), and latterly No. 22 Squadron (Westland Wessex), but under subsequent reorganisation, the SAR operations were moved to RAF Wattisham, in Suffolk where they remained until 15 July 2015, following the privatisation (and thus disbandment) of the entire UK military search and rescue operations.

Coltishall eventually became the last surviving operational RAF fighter airfield involved in the Battle of Britain (other than RAF Northolt), and a visible remnant in the form of a Second World War revetment still stands adjacent to the north-west taxiway and, together with one of the two sets of 1950s Cold War blast walls, is now a scheduled monument.

With the anticipated arrival of the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF, the gradual retirement of the Jaguar force began. Coltishall was not chosen as a future Typhoon airfield for a number of reasons, and so, with no future RAF role for Coltishall, the station was earmarked for closure.
The UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence, in the &#x27;Delivering Security in a Changing World&#x27; review, announced that the station would close by December 2006. The first two Jaguar squadrons to disband, No. 16 (R) Squadron and No. 54 (F) Squadron, did so on 11 March 2005. The final Jaguar squadrons departed on 1 April 2006, when No. 6 Squadron transferred to RAF Coningsby, however, this was subsequently disbanded on 31 May 2007 (to await delivery of the Eurofighter Typhoon at RAF Leuchars), and No. 41 (F) Squadron transferred to RAF Coningsby in OCU role. The final front line RAF movement from the station was by Jaguar XZ112, piloted by Jim Luke, on 3 April 2006.

Of the final gate guardians, the replica Hawker Hurricane (dedicated to Douglas Bader) was transferred to RAF High Wycombe, and the Jaguar was formally named the &quot;Spirit of Coltishall&quot;, and was subsequently transferred to the grounds of Norfolk County Council where she is dedicated to the memory of all those who served at Coltishall. RAF Coltishall is commemorated at the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum at Neatishead (which Coltishall formerly parented).

Some limited flying from light aircraft, including those of the Coltishall Flying Club, did continue after the end of RAF flying operations, until October 2006. While 1 April 2006 saw the disbandment parade for the station, it did not actually disband and finally close until 30 November 2006. Associated facilities such as the Douglas Bader Primary School for military dependents were also closed. On the final day of the station, the gates were opened to the public; anybody with photographic ID was welcomed onto the station to have a look around and view the final closing ceremony and parade, which saw a flypast by four RAF Jaguars, and a solitary Hawker Hurricane from the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

On 30 November 2006, RAF Coltishall was officially handed over to Defence Estates (the then MoD agency responsible for all UK Military sites) who were to handle the disposal of the site; it was then formally known as MoD Coltishall until its ultimate disposal.

The site was sold to Norfolk County Council for £4 million.

The following units were here at some point:
==Redevelopment==
The former married quarters were transferred to the MoD&#x27;s preferred property agents, Annington Homes, who started a lengthy process of upgrading the former military housing into civilian houses for sale on the open market.

During January 2007, the Home Office expressed an interest in the site, and in early February earmarked it for potential use as an immigration detention facility, but this was subsequently ruled out.

In July 2007, a petition was set up on the 10 Downing Street website to campaign for Coltishall to be reopened as a civil airfield.

In December 2007, fresh reports in the media suggested the site would be used as a prison, but this angered local residents who had not been informed of the disposal progress.

In January 2009, plans to build a Category C prison at the site was approved by North Norfolk District Council (NNDC). The entire technical site then became under the control of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and building works to convert all of the former male single-persons living accommodation H-blocks and the Junior Ranks Mess and NAAFI social club, along with the completion of the dual perimeter fences, and a new access road began in 2009. This new establishment became known as HM Prison Bure, named after the nearby River Bure, can house over 500 male sex offenders.

On 19 July 2010, North Norfolk District Council proposed that the entire site should be designated as a conservation area (United Kingdom) because of its historical and architectural interest.

In 2013, the remainder of the former RAF Coltishall technical site became known as the Scottow Enterprise Park, taking up approximately 600 acres of the former RAF base. Its repurposed military buildings are now home to tenants in industries from construction to film.

In April 2015, Scottow Moor Solar Limited built a solar farm on the site. In April 2016, another of solar panels were added, bringing the solar farm&#x27;s total capacity to .

In June 2019, a British aircraft manufacturer became established at the airfield. Swift Aircraft have been allowed to produce up to 98 aircraft a year, and use its runway for up to eight flights per day by the local government. This will employ roughly 100 local people.

The main gaurdroom has been turned into a Heritage Centre documenting the history of the site.

==Heritage==
===Station badge and motto===
RAF Coltishall&#x27;s badge, awarded in January 1953, features a fortified tower with a clenched gauntlet holding three blue arrows (bind bolts). The tower relates to the strength in defence of the station. The gauntlet and arrows represent the fighter aircraft based at the station and their aggressive nature.

The station&#x27;s motto is &#x27;Aggressive in Defence&#x27;.

===Gate guardians===
Prior to closure, Coltishall had two gate guardians. The first (on display outside the main gate and security fence) was a Jaguar S which was an airframe formed from various Jaguars, including the front fuselage of XW563. It arrived from RAF Brüggen in 2001 and was on display at the main gate until February 2007 when it was relocated to Norfolk County Hall.

A replica fibreglass Hawker Hurricane was on display on the roundabout in front of Station Headquarters from 1989, until it was relocated to RAF High Wycombe in October 2006.

===Built heritage===
In September 2010, the former RAF Coltishall site was designated as a conservation area by North Norfolk District Council and Broadland District Council.

Parts of the airfield were designated as scheduled monuments in March 2008. The designation covers a single Second World War era aircraft dispersal point (labeled as a &#x27;fighter pen&#x27;) and eight pairs of Cold War era dispersal revetment blast walls dating from the 1950s. Historic England describes the blast walls as rare and outstandingly well preserved.

The former Officers&#x27; Mess was designated as a grade II listed building in October 2017. The neo-Georgian style building was built between 1939 and 1940.

On July 18, 2024, Jaguar XZ384 left storage RAF Cosford arriving on July 19 at the former RAF Coltishall, where it has been placed as an exhibit next to the Java Bean Cafe and Coffee Roasters on site.

<text>Royal Air Force Leeming or more simply RAF Leeming is a Royal Air Force station located near Leeming, North Yorkshire, England. It was opened in 1940 and was jointly used by the RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Between 1950 and 1991, it operated mostly as a training base with Quick Reaction Force (QRF) Panavia Tornado F3 fighters based there in the latter stages of the Cold War and into the early 21st century. Since 2006, it has become the home of the deployable RAF communications cadre (No. 90 Signals Unit RAF) and the home of No. 135 Expeditionary Air Wing.

==History==
The area at the extreme western edge of the base was used in the 1930s by local flying enthusiasts. It took the name of &quot;Londonderry Aerodrome&quot; as it was closest to the hamlet of Londonderry in North Yorkshire. In the late 1930s, the Royal Air Force bought up the aerodrome and most of the surrounding land to convert it into an RAF airfield, which became known as Royal Air Force Leeming. Part of the buildup of the base included building a decoy airfield at Burneston, some to the south.

===1940s===

The station opened in June 1940 as a bomber station during the Second World War. In 1943 the station was assigned to No. 6 Group Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with a sub-station at RAF Skipton-on-Swale. The main aircraft operated were Handley Page Halifax bombers.

A detachment of No. 219 Squadron RAF used the airfield between 4 October 1939 and 12 October 1940 when the main section of the squadron was at RAF Catterick flying the Bristol Blenheim IF.
*No. 10 Squadron RAF between 8 July 1940 and 5 July 1942 flying the Handley Page Halifax Mks I &amp; II.
*No. 7 Squadron RAF reformed at the airfield on 1 August 1940 with the Short Stirling I before moving to RAF Oakington on 29 October 1940.
*No. 102 Squadron RAF between 25 August 1940 and 1 September 1940 flying the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V before moving to RAF Prestwick.
*No. 35 Squadron RAF between 20 November 1940 and 5 December 1940 using the Halifax I before moving to RAF Linton-on-Ouse.
*No. 77 Squadron RAF between 5 September 1941 and 6 May 1942 flying the Whitley V before moving to RAF Chivenor.
*No. 408 Squadron RCAF between 14 September 1942 and 27 August 1943 with the Halifax V and I before moving to RAF Linton-on-Ouse.
*1659 HCU RAF 1941–1942
*No. 424 Squadron RCAF between 8 April 1943 and 3 May 1943 using the Vickers Wellington X before moving to RAF Dalton.
*No. 427 Squadron RCAF between 5 May 1943 and 31 May 1946 when the squadron disbanded. The squadron initially used the Halifax V and III before switching to the Avro Lancaster Mk.I and III in March 1945.
*No. 429 Squadron RCAF between 13 August 1943 and 31 May 1946 when the squadron disbanded. The squadron initially used the Halifax V and III before switching to the Lancaster Mk.I and III in March 1945.

===1950–1990===

Following the war, the station became a night-fighter base, equipped initially with de Havilland Mosquito and then Gloster Meteor and Gloster Javelin aircraft before becoming a Flying Training Command airfield in 1961. The station was then home to No. 3 Flying Training School, equipped with the BAC Jet Provost aircraft.

There were also several other units using the airfield during the same period, these were:
*228 Operational Conversion Unit RAF 1948–1961
*No. 3 Flying Training School RAF 1961–1984
*Northumbrian Universities Air Squadron 1974–Present
*No. 11 Air Experience Flight 1980–Present

In January 1987, the airfield closed for one year to allow installation of Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS). RAF Leeming became the home base for three Tornado squadrons over the next twenty years.

===1990–present===

Leeming functioned as a training base until 1988 when it became a front line base in the air defence role equipped with Panavia Tornado F.3s. Its new runway was opened by Station Commander Wing Commander Kit Smith on 11 January 1988. Initially it hosted Nos 11(F), 23, and 25(F) Squadrons, all flying the F3. 23 Squadron was disbanded on 1 March 1994 and its air and ground crews dispersed across the station&#x27;s remaining two squadrons. This left two Tornado squadrons, which were half of the air defence fighter squadrons of the RAF. 11 Squadron was disbanded in October 2005. The last Tornado squadron at Leeming, No 25(F) Squadron, disbanded on 4 April 2008. No. 100 Squadron RAF with Hawk T.1As arrived on 21 September 1995 from RAF Finningley.

No. 135 Expeditionary Air Wing was formed at Leeming on 1 April 2006 to create a deployable air force structure. Since that time it has deployed several times for Baltic Air Policing.

The station&#x27;s air traffic control unit was named the best in the Royal Air Force in February 2012, winning the Raytheon Falconer Trophy.

RAF Leeming had been host to a BAE Systems reverse assembly line process (Reduce to Produce (RTP)) programme in which redundant Tornado aircraft were brought into one of the hangars at RAF Leeming and stripped of all usable components. The process started with the F3 variant of the aircraft as it was the first to be withdrawn completely from service, and moved onto the GR4 variant later. In October 2017, it was announced that the full retirement of the Tornado aircraft from RAF service in 2019 meant that this process would end with the loss of 245 British Aerospace jobs between RAF Leeming and RAF Marham.

607 (County of Durham) Squadron reformed at RAF Leeming on 5 January 2015. The Squadron formerly flew fighter aircraft and was disbanded in 1957. The squadron is a General Service Support (GSS) unit with many diverse roles such as chef, driver, intelligence analyst and suppliers.

In March 2019, the Ministry of Defence indicated that RAF Leeming, alongside RAF Waddington and RAF Wittering, was being considered as the future home of the RAF Aerobatic Team the Red Arrows. In May 2020 however it was confirmed that the team would move to Waddington.

On 22 April 2020, the government announced that alpha testing of a prototype of the government&#x27;s COVID-19 app was in progress at RAF Leeming.

On 1 December 2020, it was announced that the Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron had relocated to RAF Leeming from RAF Linton-on-Ouse as part of the latter&#x27;s closure by the end of 2021.

The first of nine Hawk 167 aircraft to be operated by a newly established Joint Qatar Emiri Air Force-RAF Hawk Training Squadron arrived at Leeming in early September 2021. The squadron will train pilots from both air forces and be home to the Qatar Emiri Air Force&#x27;s entire fleet of Hawks. The RAF&#x27;s No. 100 Squadron, operating the Hawk T1 in the aggressor role disbanded on 31 March 2022.

==Role and operations==
The deployable elements of the station structure form the core of an Expeditionary Air Wing, No. 135 Expeditionary Air Wing. For Exercise &#x27;Griffin Strike 2016&#x27; in April 2016, No. 135 EAW became the combined French-British No. 135 Combined Expeditionary Air Wing.

==Accidents and incidents==

* 21 February 1944 – a RCAF Halifax, LV836, of No. 427 Sqn crashed into farmland at Romanby, creating a fireball and killing all seven crew on impact. The aircraft had left RAF Leeming nine minutes earlier, at 00:15, on a bombing mission to Stuttgart. On 10 March 2010 a memorial to the crew was unveiled at the crash site, which is now part of Romanby Golf &amp; Country Club.
* 13 August 1951 – two aircraft from RAF Leeming collided over Hudswell, near to Richmond, North Yorkshire. A cadet in the No. 228 Operational Conversion Unit Wellington aircraft was given the only serviceable parachute by Flight Lieutenant John Quinton, shown how to operate it and ordered to bale out. The other eight crew members of both aircraft died when their aircraft hit the ground.
* 22 October 1999 – a 100 Sqn Hawk struck a bridge and crashed into an unoccupied building near the village of Shap, killing the pilot and navigator. The RAF Board of Inquiry suggested that aircrew fatigue may have contributed to the accident. A jury returned a verdict of accidental death.
* 28 January 2016 – during a training sortie, the pilot of a 100 Sqn Hawk experienced partial loss of vision. The base commander considered instructing the pilot to eject over the North Sea, but instead scrambled another Hawk, flown by an instructor. The two aircraft flew in formation to Leeming, and conducted a successful talk down landing.

==Heritage==
===Station badge ===

The station badge was awarded in April 1942 and shows a &quot;sword erect point uppermost Gules hilted Argent&quot;. The sword reflects the fighting spirit of the station, and the motto is &quot;Straight and True&quot;.

===Gate Guardian===
Leeming&#x27;s gate guardian is now a Tornado F3, commemorating its history as an air defence base, and the fact that many Tornados were scrapped/Reduced To Produce here. The previous gate guardian &quot;XA634&quot; is the world&#x27;s only surviving Gloster Javelin FAW4, which spent most of its life as a testbed at the Gloster Aircraft Company and was offered for sale by tender in September 2014 by the Ministry of Defence. In December 2014 it was announced that Gloucestershire Jet Age Museum had won the tender and purchased the aircraft.

<text>Daniel James White (September 2, 1946 – October 21, 1985) was an American politician who assassinated George Moscone (mayor of San Francisco) and Harvey Milk (member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors) inside City Hall on November 27, 1978. White was convicted of manslaughter for the deaths of Milk and Moscone and served five years of a seven-year prison sentence. Less than two years after his release, he returned to San Francisco and later committed suicide.

==Early life==
Dan White was born in Long Beach, California, on September 2, 1946, the second of nine children in a working-class Irish-American family. He grew up in the Visitacion Valley neighborhood of San Francisco and attended Archbishop Riordan High School, until he was expelled for violence in his junior year. He went on to attend Woodrow Wilson High School (later renamed Phillip and Sala Burton High School).

==Career==
White enlisted in the United States Army in June 1965. He served during the Vietnam War as a sergeant with the 101st Airborne Division between 1969 and 1970, and was honorably discharged in 1971.

Following a stint as a security guard at A. J. Dimond High School in Anchorage, Alaska, White returned to San Francisco and joined the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). According to a &quot;SF Weekly&quot; newspaper account, he allegedly quit the force after reporting another officer for beating a handcuffed suspect. White then joined the San Francisco Fire Department, in which he rescued a woman and her baby from a seventh-floor apartment. The city&#x27;s newspapers referred to him as &quot;an all-American boy&quot;.

===Election as supervisor===
In 1977, White was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from District 8, which included several neighborhoods near the southeastern boundaries of San Francisco. At that time, supervisors were elected by district and not &quot;at-large&quot;, as they had been before and then were again during the 1980s and 1990s. 

White, a Democrat, had strong support from police and firefighter unions. His district was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a largely white, middle-class section that is hostile to the growing homosexual community of San Francisco.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; stated that as a supervisor, White saw himself as the board&#x27;s &quot;defender of the home, the family and religious life against homosexuals, pot smokers and cynics&quot;. In a 1977 campaign brochure he wrote, &quot;I am not going to be forced out of San Francisco by splinter groups of radicals, social deviates, and incorrigibles... There are thousands upon thousands of frustrated, angry people such as yourself, waiting to unleash a fury that can and will eradicate the malignancies which blight our city.&quot;
 White held a mixed record on gay rights, opposing the Briggs Initiative which sought to ban gays and lesbians from working in California&#x27;s public schools, yet voting against an ordinance prohibiting discrimination against gays in housing and employment.

===Tenure as supervisor===
Despite their personal differences, White and Harvey Milk, who was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and was the first openly gay officeholder in California history, had several areas of political agreement and initially worked well together. Milk was one of three people from City Hall invited to the baptism of White&#x27;s newborn child shortly after the 1977 election. White also persuaded Dianne Feinstein, then president of the Board of Supervisors, to appoint Milk chairman of the Streets and Transportation Committee.

In April 1978, the Roman Catholic Church proposed a facility in White&#x27;s district for juvenile offenders who had committed murder, arson, rape and other crimes, to be operated by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. White strongly opposed the facility, while Milk supported it, and their difference of opinion led to a conflict between the two.

==Assassinations of George Moscone and Harvey Milk==

Following a disagreement over a proposed drug rehabilitation center in the Mission District, White frequently clashed with Milk, as well as other members of the board. On November 10, 1978, White resigned his seat as supervisor. The reasons he cited were his dissatisfaction with what he saw as the corrupt practices of San Francisco politics, as well as the difficulty of earning a living without a police officer&#x27;s or firefighter&#x27;s salary, jobs he could not retain legally while serving as a supervisor. White had opened a baked potato stand at Pier 39, which failed to become profitable. He reversed his resignation on November 14, after his supporters lobbied him to seek reappointment from Mayor George Moscone. Moscone initially agreed to White&#x27;s request, but later refused the appointment at the urging of Milk and others. 

On November 27, 1978, White visited City Hall with the later-declared intention of killing not only Moscone and Milk, but also two other San Francisco politicians, Speaker of the California State Assembly Willie Brown (who himself would later serve as mayor) and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, whom he also blamed for lobbying Moscone not to reappoint him. White climbed through a basement window carrying a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36 revolver and 10 rounds of ammunition. By entering the building through the window, White managed to avoid the recently installed metal detectors. After entering Moscone&#x27;s office, White pleaded to be reinstated as supervisor. When Moscone refused, White shot him in the shoulder, the chest, and twice in the head. He then walked to Milk&#x27;s office, reloaded the gun and fatally shot Milk five times, firing the final two shots with the gun&#x27;s barrel touching Milk&#x27;s skull. White then fled City Hall, surrendering to the police at Northern Police Station, where he had formerly been a police officer. While being interviewed, White recorded a tearful confession, stating, &quot;I just shot him.&quot;

===Trial and &quot;Twinkie defense&quot;===

At trial, White&#x27;s defense team argued that his mental state at the time of the murders was one of diminished capacity due to depression. They argued that he was therefore not capable of premeditating the murders, and thus was not legally guilty of first-degree murder. Forensic psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White exhibited several behavioral symptoms of depression, including the fact that White had gone from being highly health-conscious to consuming sugary foods and drinks. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. When the prosecution played a recording of White&#x27;s confession, several jurors wept as they listened to what was described as &quot;a man pushed beyond his endurance&quot;. Many people familiar with City Hall claimed that it was common to enter through the window White had used to save time. An acquaintance of White&#x27;s, who knew him from the SFPD, claimed that several officials carried weapons at this time and speculated that White carried the extra ammunition as a habit that police officers had. 

White was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and he was sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. Outrage within San Francisco&#x27;s gay community over the sentence sparked the city&#x27;s White Night riots. General disdain for the verdict led to the elimination of California&#x27;s &quot;diminished capacity&quot; law. In June 1979, psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a critic of forensic psychiatry, gave a speech to a large audience in San Francisco calling the verdict a &quot;travesty of justice&quot; which he blamed on the diminished capacity defense.

=== Alleged confession ===
In 1998, Frank Falzon, the SFPD homicide inspector to whom White had surrendered after the murders, said that he met with White in 1984, and that at this meeting White had confessed his intention to kill Brown and Silver along with Moscone and Milk. Falzon quoted White as having said, &quot;I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing.&quot; Falzon indicated that he believed White, stating, &quot;I felt like I had been hit by a sledge-hammer ... I found out it was a premeditated murder.&quot;

==Imprisonment and parole==
White served five years of his seven-year sentence at Soledad State Prison and was paroled on January 7, 1984. Fearing he might be murdered in retaliation for his crimes, authorities secretly transported him to Los Angeles, where he served a year&#x27;s parole. At the completion of his parole, White sought to return to San Francisco; Feinstein, by now elected mayor, urged him not to return on the basis that doing so would jeopardize public safety. Joel Wachs, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, also argued to keep White out of Los Angeles. White eventually did move back to San Francisco, where he lived with his wife and children.

==Suicide==

On October 21, 1985, less than two years after his release, White killed himself by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage. He was buried at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, with a traditional government-furnished headstone issued for war veterans. He was survived by his two sons, his daughter and his widow.

==Media adaptations==
The story of the assassinations is told in the Academy Award-winning documentary film &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot; (1984), which was released a year before White committed suicide.

The American hardcore punk rock band Dead Kennedys altered the lyrics to the song &quot;I Fought The Law&quot; to tell the story of the assassinations from White&#x27;s perspective, which was released on the 1987 compilation &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death.&quot;

The &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Pride&quot; is heavily based on White&#x27;s assassination of Harvey Milk. The killer in the episode is a former police officer and current politician who kills a victim known for his support for gay rights.

White was portrayed by Josh Brolin in the 2008 film &quot;Milk&quot;. The film depicted White from his first meeting with Milk up to and including Milk&#x27;s death. Brolin&#x27;s nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was one of eight nominations the film received overall.

White&#x27;s life, the assassinations, and his trial are covered in the 1984 book &quot;Double Play: The San Francisco City Hall Killings&quot; by Mike Weiss, which won the Edgar Award as Best True Crime Book of the Year. An expanded second edition, &quot;Double Play: The Hidden Passions Behind the Double Assassination of George Moscone and Harvey Milk,&quot; was issued in 2010 and updated White&#x27;s story to include his life after prison and his suicide. The second edition also includes a DVD with a half-hour video interview of White.

&quot;Execution of Justice,&quot; a play by Emily Mann, chronicles the events leading to the assassinations. In 1999, the play was adapted to film for cable network Showtime, with Tim Daly portraying White.

&quot;Harvey Milk&quot; is an opera in three acts composed by Stewart Wallace to a libretto by Michael Korie. A joint commission by Houston Grand Opera, New York City Opera, and San Francisco Opera, it was premiered on January 21, 1995, by Houston Grand Opera.

<text>Royal Air Force Kinloss, or more simply RAF Kinloss, is a former Royal Air Force station located near the village of Kinloss, on the Moray Firth in the north east of Scotland, UK. 

The RAF station opened on 1 April 1939 and served as a training establishment during the Second World War. After the war it was handed over to Coastal Command to monitor Soviet ships and submarines in the Norwegian Sea. Until 2010 it was the main base for the RAF&#x27;s fleet of Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.2 maritime patrol aircraft. It was intended that the MR2 would be replaced by the Nimrod MRA.4, but the MRA4 was cancelled in the Strategic Defence and Security Review of October 2010. As a result, Kinloss became surplus to RAF requirements and regular flying operations ceased on 31 July 2011. 

In November 2011, the Ministry of Defence and 12 (Air Support) Engineer Group of the British Army announced that 930 personnel from 39 Engineer Regiment (Air Support) would move from Waterbeach Barracks, near Cambridge, to Kinloss in summer 2012. The first personnel of 39 Engineer Regiment arrived in June 2012, with the majority arriving in July 2012. The airfield is maintained as a relief landing site by Eurofighter Typhoon FGR.4s from nearby RAF Lossiemouth.

On 26 July 2012 the RAF Ensign was lowered for the last time, and replaced by the flag of 39 Engineer Regiment, marking the establishment of Kinloss Barracks.

==History==

===Construction===
The area around Kinloss was surveyed in 1937 for the purposes of identifying land to establish a new flying training school for the Royal Air Force. In January 1938, of agricultural land within the Barony of Muirton was compulsorily purchased at Kinloss Home Farm, Easter Langcot, Wester Langcot, Doon Park and Muirton. Contractor Mowlem began work in March 1938, with several farm buildings being demolished and land cleared. By August 1938, construction of three C-type hangars, support buildings and airmen&#x27;s wooden hut accommodation was under-way, along with the laying out of three grass surfaced runways, each long.

RAF Kinloss opened on 1 April 1939 as part of No. 21 Group, with Group Captain Arthur Peck being the first commander of the station. Initially, many personnel who were posted to Kinloss were previously unaware of the station and were surprised at how far north it was located. The northerly latitude of the station later earned it the nickname within the RAF of &quot;Ice Station Kilo&quot;, after the 1968 espionage film &quot;Ice Station Zebra.&quot;

No. 14 Flying Training School (FTS) was soon established from No. 8 FTS personnel based at RAF Montrose. It was initially equipped with thirty-eight Airspeed Oxfords and twenty-six Hawker Harts and Audaxes. The first aircraft, an Oxford with serial &quot;N4584&quot;, arrived on 9 May 1939, with the first student aircrews arriving on 13 May. In August 1939 North American Harvards replaced the Harts. October 1939 saw the addition of ten Avro Ansons and six Harts from the recently disbanded No. 13 FTS which was based at RAF Drem in East Lothian.

=== Second World War ===
In late 1939, the station hosted detachments of Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys of No. 10, No. 51, No. 77 and No. 102 Squadron. The aircraft were taking part in operations against German U-boats operating in the north Atlantic. In December that year, Supermarine Spitfires of No. 609 Squadron were temporarily based at Kinloss whilst tasked with defending vessels of the Home Fleet moored in Loch Ewe.

No. 45 Maintenance Unit was established on 15 April 1940, the role of which was to store, modify and fit-out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. The unit&#x27;s first aircraft, a Harvard, arrived on 31 May 1940. A large number of aircraft types were stored at Kinloss during 1940 including, Hawker Audax, Hawker Hind, Hawker Hart, De Havilland Tiger Moth, Handley Page Harrow, Miles Magister, Airspeed Envoy, Bristol Blenheim, Airspeed Oxford, Hawker Hector, Avro Tutor, Westland Wallace and later Whitley, Spitfire Vickers Wellington and Handley Page Halifax. By October 1940 the unit had approximately 440 personnel.

The German invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940 led to an increase in operational activity at Kinloss and other Scottish airfields. As a result, No. 14 FTS moved south to RAF Cranfield in Bedfordshire on 20 April 1940. A detachment of No. 77 and No. 109 Squadron Whitleys from RAF Driffield returned the same month to undertake bombing missions in Norway, departing Kinloss in May.

Kinloss was transferred to No. 4 Group on 27 May 1940, at the time part of RAF Bomber Command. At the same time No. 19 Operational Training unit (No. 19 OTU) was formed and tasked with training aircrews on heavy-bomber aircraft before deployment onto operational squadrons. The unit was initially equipped with forty-eight Whitleys and sixteen Avro Ansons and the first training courses began in June 1940. By 1941 Kinloss was overcrowded with aircraft belonging to No. 45 MU and No. 19 OTU, therefore a satellite station was constructed at Balnageith, to the south west of the nearby town of Forres. The satellite, known as RAF Forres, opened on 25 January 1941, with &#x27;D&#x27; flight of No. 19 OTU and their Whitleys moving in on 27 April 1941 and &#x27;C&#x27; flight following on 13 May 1941. Despite this, Kinloss continued to struggle to accommodate all No. 45 MU&#x27;s aircraft. To relieve pressure on space, two satellite landing grounds (SLG) were established to store aircraft off-site in August 1941. These were at RAF Dornoch (No. 40 SLG) near Dornoch and RAF Kirkton (No. 41 SLG) near Golspie, located 23 and 27 miles away across the Moray Firth respectively.

During the summer of 1942, Kinloss&#x27;s grass runways were replaced with permanent paved runways, with the main runway extended to 1,828m (now runway 07/25) and two secondary runways constructed. This allowed a wide range of aircraft types to use Kinloss as a diversion airfield when their home stations further south were closed due to poor weather. By the end of 1943, around 350 aircraft were stored by No. 45 MU. Throughout the war a high number of aircraft from Kinloss crashed resulting in the loss of aircrews and it was not unusual to see the wreckage of aircraft in the countryside around the station. This was predominately because of the older aircraft that were used for training by No. 19 OTU, poor weather and inexperienced crews.

Towards the end of 1944, the requirement for trained bomber crews reduced, resulting in RAF Forres closing in October of that year. In November, No. 19 OTU&#x27;s Whitleys were replaced with forty Wellington bombers. VE Day on 8 May 1945 marked the end of the war in Europe and shortly after on 20 May, No. 19 OTU was disbanded, with its aircraft being sent to various maintenance units around the UK. The runway was resurfaced in June 1945, whilst No. 45 MU prepared aircraft for the continuing war in the Far East. The unit was also soon deluged with surplus aircraft for sale or scrap.

===Cold War===
In October 1945 No. 6 Coastal OTU arrived and saw the beginning of Kinloss&#x27;s association with anti-submarine and maritime patrol operations, an association that continued until the station&#x27;s closure. The wartime Avro Lancaster was adapted for anti-submarine and search and rescue duties and RAF Kinloss changed from a bomber training unit, to a Coastal Command base training maritime aircrew. Its personnel now also included National Servicemen.

No. 19 (C)OTU was split into No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit and the School of Maritime Reconnaissance in 1947 with No. 236 OCU remaining at Kinloss. A further change in 1956 saw the units re-combine as the Maritime Operational Training Unit (MOTU), which remained at Kinloss until 1965.

During the Cold War, Kinloss squadrons carried out anti-submarine duties, locating and shadowing Soviet naval units. In 1951, No. 217 Squadron was resurrected with Lockheed Neptune MR.1 aircraft to cover the maritime reconnaissance and search and rescue roles pending the further development of the Avro Shackleton aircraft. It was also prominent in Operation Snowdrop, supplying food to cut off villages and livestock fodder to isolated crofts in Scotland, during the winter of 1954 and 1955. The squadron was upgraded with MR.2 versions of the Neptune in 1956, only to be disbanded again in July 1956.

In July 1962, the station received one of its highest honours, the Civic Freedom of the Royal and Ancient Burgh of Forres, allowing Kinloss personnel the right to march through the burgh with swords drawn. This was the first time any military unit had been so honoured by Forres throughout the burgh&#x27;s 1,400-year history.

In 1972 and 1976, the new Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.1 demonstrated its capabilities when it flew surveillance sorties over Iceland&#x27;s disputed fishing limits, providing support for the Royal Navy and British trawlers in the Cod Wars. For much of the period No.120 Squadron, No. 201 Squadron, and No. 206 Squadron were the main Nimrod units.

In November 1980 two pilots, Royal Australian Air Force Flight Lieutenant Noel Anthony and RAF Flying Officer Stephen Belcher were killed when their Nimrod aircraft struck birds on take-off and crashed in woods to the east of Kinloss airfield. The remainder of the crew survived. Anthony was awarded the Air Force Cross and Belcher the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air.

After the Argentines invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982, Nimrod MR2&#x27;s adapted for air-to-air refuelling, were deployed to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic to support the Falklands War effort.

===Post-Cold War===

In 1991, Nimrods deployed to the Persian Gulf as an integral component of the coalition forces to recapture Kuwait during the Gulf War. Furthermore, Nimrods were deployed to the Adriatic as part of the United Nations peace-keeping force in the 1990s Yugoslav Wars. More recently in 2003, the Nimrod played a pivotal role in Operation Telic. The station&#x27;s high level of involvement in operational activities led to RAF Kinloss being awarded the coveted Stainforth Trophy for the best operational performance in 2004.

In April 2005, No. 206 Squadron was disbanded as part of a defence review the previous year. The base was used for the 2005 Edinburgh and South Scotland Wing Air Cadet Annual Summer Camp.

On 2 September 2006, twelve Nimrod crew members from No. 120 Squadron&#x27;s crew 3 and two observers were killed when their Nimrod, serial number &quot;XV230&quot;, exploded over Afghanistan.

No. 325 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW) was formed at the station on 1 April 2006. The wing encompassed most of the non-formed unit personnel on station. The EAW did not include the flying units at the station.

== Closure of RAF Station ==
In December 2009, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 by March 2010, twelve months earlier than originally planned. It was also announced that the in-service date of its replacement, the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4, would be delayed until Autumn 2012, with the aircraft expected to start arriving at Kinloss in February 2010. This was delayed again in June 2010 when it was announced that the MRA4 would arrive at the end of 2010.

With Nimrod MR2 operations having ended in March 2010, the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010 revealed that the Nimrod MRA4 programme would in-fact be cancelled and that RAF Kinloss would close. Station commander Group Captain James Johnston said there had been disbelief when the announcement was made. As a result, No. 120, No. 201 and No. 42(R) Squadron (the Operational Conversion Unit) were disbanded on 26 May 2011 at a ceremony attended by the station&#x27;s Honorary Air Commodore, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The RAF station ceased to be operational on 31 July 2011.

==Post RAF use==
=== Establishment of Army barracks ===
On 18 July 2011, the MOD announced that Kinloss would become a British Army barracks, with army units arriving in 2014 or 2015. A further announcement in November 2011 confirmed that 39 Engineer Regiment (Air Support) of the Royal Engineers would move from Waterbeach Barracks, near Cambridge, to Kinloss Barracks in July 2012. It was expected that 930 service personnel and their families would move at this time. The number of army personnel based at Kinloss would be 41% down on the number of personnel which were present during the RAF&#x27;s tenure.

After 73 years as an RAF station, control of Kinloss transferred to the British Army at 12:00 on 26 July 2012. A ceremony was attended by eight former RAF Kinloss station commanders, the last station commander Group Captain James Johnston, the Lord Lieutenant of Moray and invited guests. The RAF colours were lowered for the last time and British Army colours raised to mark the new chapter in Kinloss&#x27;s history.

=== Flying activities ===
The airfield at Kinloss is maintained by the RAF as a relief landing ground for aircraft based at nearby RAF Lossiemouth and continues to be used by Moray Flying Club. It cannot be booked by other aircraft as a diversion airfield or for refuelling stops. Until its disbandment in 2017, the RAF&#x27;s No. 663 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, operating the Grob Vigilant T1, also operated from the airfield. 

During 2020, regular flying temporarily returned to Kinloss when the first of the RAF&#x27;s Poseidon MRA1 fleet arrived in the UK from the United States in February 2020, initially operating from the barracks whilst work was carried out at RAF Lossiemouth to accommodate the new aircraft. Lossiemouth&#x27;s airfield was closed between 10 August and 16 October 2020 whilst the intersection of its two runways was resurfaced. During the closure, routine Typhoon FGR4 training operations were relocated to Kinloss. A second Poseidon arrived before they and the Typhoons departed for Lossiemouth on the re-opening of the Lossiemouth in October 2020.

== Unit profiles ==

=== Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre ===
RAF Kinloss became home to the UK Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) in 1997 when the ARCC&#x27;s located in Edinburgh and Plymouth were combined into one centre covering the whole UK Search and Rescue Region. The ARCC was responsible for tasking all UK search and rescue (SAR) assets such as RAF, Royal Navy and coastguard helicopters, fixed wing aircraft and mountain rescue teams. It coordinated a wide range of activities associated with SAR operations, including overland search planning, refuelling arrangements, airspace considerations, multi-agency communications, and co-ordination with other emergency services. The ARCC included the UK Mission Control Centre (UKMCC) which is the facility responsible for the detection and notification of emergency distress beacon alerts through the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, which is able to detect beacon activations worldwide through a network of satellites.

Despite the transfer of Kinloss from the RAF to the British Army in 2012, the ARCC remained at the station. However, in December 2014 the Ministry of Defence announced that the ARCC at Kinloss would close and be relocated to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#x27;s National Maritime Operations Centre located in Fareham, Hampshire. The Kinloss ARCC closed on 31 March 2016, with twenty-seven RAF personnel being redeployed to other RAF stations, or leaving the service, and ten civilian jobs being lost from Kinloss.

=== Mountain Rescue Team ===
The RAF Kinloss Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) was established in July 1944 as part of the RAF Mountain Rescue Service. Prior to that, mountain rescue had been carried out by a voluntary team. With the closure of Kinloss as an RAF base in July 2012, the RAF Kinloss Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) was renamed the RAF Lossiemouth MRT. The team continued to operate from their existing purpose built base at Kinloss for over two years, until they moved into the former &#x27;D&#x27; Flight No. 202 Squadron hangar at Lossiemouth in February 2015.

=== Nimrod Major Servicing Unit ===
The Nimrod Major Servicing Unit (NMSU) was established on 1 March 1971 to provide dedicated maintenance to the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod fleet. The unit provided servicing for both the maritime reconnaissance (MR1 and MR2) and reconnaissance (R1) variants of the Nimrod, from three hangars (No. 11, 12 and 13) on the north side of the airfield. The NMSU was manned by RAF personnel until June 1995 when the function was privatised. A joint venture of Flight Refuelling Aviation (FRA) and Serco took on the role, with the contract being renewed in 1998 when FRA became the primary contractor. BAE Systems took on the contract in 2000, with FRA still provided maintenance services and the organisation becoming known as the Nimrod Support Group (NSG). The NSG continued operating until the Nimrod&#x27;s withdrawal from service in March 2010.

== Suspected postwar radioactive contamination ==
After the Second World War, Kinloss was used to break-up surplus RAF aircraft and recover what was recyclable. Kinloss was chosen due to its remote location, and hence easy access to potential landfill sites which would be largely undisturbed by the public. The aircraft broken up included various components which had carried chemical weapons (including sulphur mustard), and were painted with fluorescent paint containing radium to allow the planes to be more easily operated at night. On removal, these contaminated items were buried in landfill sites either on the base or close to it.

In 2004, with the development of a new water pipeline, a land quality assessment warned that sulphur mustard may be present within landfill and waste areas accessible to the public. The report stated that RAF believed there was a potential for chemical weapons agents and radiological contamination to be present in the ground:

However, no trace of chemical weapons agents was found during the land quality assessment, although material contaminated with radium was removed from land near the base in 2004.

After the 2004 documents became public in May 2012, it emerged that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) was investigating radioactive contamination at the site linked to the use of &quot;glow in the dark paint&quot; in Second World War aircraft.

<text>Ministry of Defence Lyneham or MOD Lyneham is a Ministry of Defence site in Wiltshire, England, about north-east of Chippenham and south-west of Swindon. The site houses the Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering. Also here is Prince Philip Barracks, housing the regimental headquarters of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), 8 Training Battalion REME and the REME Museum.

Previously, the site was RAF Lyneham which closed on 31 December 2012.

==History==

===RAF Lyneham===
RAF Lyneham was built in 1939, initially as a grass landing area although the RAF always planned to lay hard runways. Hangars and other buildings were dispersed around the site to avoid creating one large target for an aerial enemy.

The station was opened on 18 May 1940 as No. 33 Maintenance Unit (33MU). During the war, the station&#x27;s squadrons operated regular transport schedules to Gibraltar.

In 1971 five Hercules squadrons were based at Lyneham, as well as a VIP transport Comet squadron, and in 1976, the station became the largest operational airfield in the RAF with the arrival from Cyprus of Hercules-equipped No. 70 Squadron RAF (LXX Sqn), bringing to seven the station&#x27;s total of aircraft squadrons.
=== Closure of RAF station ===
The decision to close RAF Lyneham was made in 2009, with all functions and aircraft relocated to RAF Brize Norton. With the transfer of military units and personnel to Brize Norton complete, around 1,000 members of military and civilian staff remained on site, gradually reducing in numbers until RAF Lyneham closed entirely, on 31 December 2012. Military flying operations from RAF Lyneham ceased on 30 September 2011, at which point the station&#x27;s air traffic control unit closed. 

A stone memorial commemorating the RAF&#x27;s use of the station for over 70 years was unveiled on 1 June 2012. All remaining RAF Lyneham personnel left the station by December 2012.

=== Transfer to defence training role ===

==== 2011 plans ====
As part of the Defence Technical Training Change Programme, part of the wider Defence Training Review, the MOD announced on 18 July 2011 that the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT) would relocate to Lyneham. Plans called for the relocation of various British Army, Royal Navy and RAF training facilities to Lyneham, with the aim of modernising technical training and achieving efficiencies. Initially it was planned that the following training functions would relocate to Lyneham.

* Electronic and Mechanical Engineering – training for vehicle mechanics and marine engineers, recovery mechanics, armourers, metalsmiths, control equipment technicians and technical support specialists. As a result of the move to Lyneham, the army&#x27;s Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) technical training establishments at Arborfield Garrison in Berkshire and Bordon Camp in Hampshire, would both close. No. 4 School of Technical Training based at RAF St. Athan in Vale of Glamorgan and the Defence School of Marine Engineering at in Gosport, Hampshire, would also relocate.
* Aeronautical Engineering – training for avionics and aircraft technicians. Delivery of training would relocate from Arborfield Garrison, No. 1 School of Technical Training and the Aeronautical Engineering &amp; Management Training School at RAF Cosford in Shropshire and the Royal Naval Air Engineering &amp; Survival Equipment School at HMS &quot;Sultan&quot;. 
* Communications and Information Systems – field based tactical training and classroom/workshop based technical training, relocating from the Royal School of Signals at Blandford Camp in Dorset and No. 1 Radio School at RAF Cosford.

A planning application for the redevelopment of MOD Lyneham was submitted by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation to Wiltshire Council in May 2013 Planning permission was granted in October 2013 for the re-development of the station including the demolition of several existing structures and the construction of new and refurbished buildings to accommodate single living accommodation, dining, mess and welfare facilities, workshops, teaching accommodation and classrooms, offices, stores, medical and dental centre, church, museum, physical and recreational training centre, the creation of outdoor training areas including ground works and ground level alterations, the erection of masts, towers and radars, a forward operating base training facility, obstacle course, assault course, firing range, sports pitches, new roads, footpaths, parking, hard and soft landscaping, lighting, balancing ponds, and access alterations including a new roundabout and ancillary works.

The demolition of some unsafe and redundant buildings commenced in early 2013. The re-development was planned to be undertaken in a series of phases, construction beginning in 2014 and completing in December 2015, with the first units arriving and the start of training taking place in 2016. Further units would arrive in subsequent years with the programme being complete in 2019. The contract for the first phase was valued at between £180m and £230m. 

In December 2013, a £121m contract for the first phase of work was awarded to Hercules, a 50:50 joint-venture between Kier Group and Balfour Beatty. Construction work commenced in February 2014. Babcock&#x27;s Defence and Security Division were awarded a contract in August 2014 to supply and support REME training at Lyneham, with a full operating capability programmed for February 2016.

==== 2015 re-evaluation ====
Michael Fallon, Secretary of State for Defence, announced in September 2015 that the relocation of the RAF and Royal Navy training elements to Lyneham would no longer take place. A re-evaluation of the programme determined that the consolidation onto a single site was no longer the best option. The first phase, the relocation of the REME schools from Arborfield and Bordon would still proceed.

REME training at Arborfield and Bordon transferred to Lyneham in September 2015, and was due to begin at Lyneham by November of that year. The School of Army Aeronautical Engineering (SAAE), which moved from Arborfield, started training in October 2015.

The new regimental headquarters of the REME was officially opened on 11 March 2016 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and given the name The Prince Philip Barracks.

==Role and operations==

=== Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering ===
Lyneham is home to the Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (DSEME), part of the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT) within No. 22 Group RAF. The school trains current and future Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) technicians.

===Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers===
The REME Museum, previously based in Arborfield, Berkshire, moved into the former Officers&#x27; Mess in 2015. The move provided an opportunity to refresh the displays and layout as well as provide new facilities such as a café, archives and a reading/conference room. There are dedicated education facilities to cater for groups of all ages and interests. The new museum opened to the public in June 2017.

The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers also have their corps headquarters on the camp.

<doc id="475008" wikidata="Q569057" url="?curid=475008" title="Stiffness">
<text>Stiffness is the extent to which an object resists deformation in response to an applied force.

The complementary concept is flexibility or pliability: the more flexible an object is, the less stiff it is.

==Calculations==
The stiffness, formula_1 of a body is a measure of the resistance offered by an elastic body to deformation. For an elastic body with a single degree of freedom (DOF) (for example, stretching or compression of a rod), the stiffness is defined as
formula_2
where,
* formula_3 is the force on the body
* formula_4 is the displacement produced by the force along the same degree of freedom (for instance, the change in length of a stretched spring)
Stiffness is usually defined under quasi-static conditions, but sometimes under dynamic loading.

In the International System of Units, stiffness is typically measured in newtons per meter (formula_5). In Imperial units, stiffness is typically measured in pounds (lbs) per inch.

Generally speaking, deflections (or motions) of an infinitesimal element (which is viewed as a point) in an elastic body can occur along multiple DOF (maximum of six DOF at a point). For example, a point on a horizontal beam can undergo both a vertical displacement and a rotation relative to its undeformed axis. When there are formula_6 degrees of freedom a formula_7 matrix must be used to describe the stiffness at the point. The diagonal terms in the matrix are the direct-related stiffnesses (or simply stiffnesses) along the same degree of freedom and the off-diagonal terms are the coupling stiffnesses between two different degrees of freedom (either at the same or different points) or the same degree of freedom at two different points. In industry, the term influence coefficient is sometimes used to refer to the coupling stiffness.

It is noted that for a body with multiple DOF, the equation above generally does not apply since the applied force generates not only the deflection along its direction (or degree of freedom) but also those along with other directions.

For a body with multiple DOF, to calculate a particular direct-related stiffness (the diagonal terms), the corresponding DOF is left free while the remaining should be constrained. Under such a condition, the above equation can obtain the direct-related stiffness for the degree of unconstrained freedom. The ratios between the reaction forces (or moments) and the produced deflection are the coupling stiffnesses.

The elasticity tensor is a generalization that describes all possible stretch and shear parameters.

A single spring may intentionally be designed to have variable (non-linear) stiffness throughout its displacement.

== Compliance ==
The inverse of stiffness is or , typically measured in units of metres per newton. In rheology, it may be defined as the ratio of strain to stress, and so take the units of reciprocal stress, for example, 1/Pa.

==Rotational stiffness==
A body may also have a rotational stiffness, formula_1 given by
formula_9
where
* formula_6 is the applied moment
* formula_11 is the rotation angle

In the SI system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in newton-metres per radian.

In the SAE system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in inch-pounds per degree.

Further measures of stiffness are derived on a similar basis, including:
* shear stiffness - the ratio of applied shear force to shear deformation
* torsional stiffness - the ratio of applied torsion moment to the angle of twist

== Relationship to elasticity ==
The elastic modulus of a material is not the same as the stiffness of a component made from that material. Elastic modulus is a property of the constituent material; stiffness is a property of a structure or component of a structure, and hence it is dependent upon various physical dimensions that describe that component. That is, the modulus is an intensive property of the material; stiffness, on the other hand, is an extensive property of the solid body that is dependent on the material its shape and boundary conditions. For example, for an element in tension or compression, the axial stiffness is
formula_12
where
* formula_13 is the (tensile) elastic modulus (or Young&#x27;s modulus),
* formula_14 is the cross-sectional area,
* formula_15 is the length of the element.

Similarly, the torsional stiffness of a straight section is
formula_16
where
* formula_17 is the rigidity modulus of the material,
* formula_18 is the torsion constant for the section.

Note that the torsional stiffness has dimensions [force] * [length] / [angle], so that its SI units are N*m/rad.

For the special case of unconstrained uniaxial tension or compression, Young&#x27;s modulus be thought of as a measure of the stiffness of a structure.

== Applications ==
The stiffness of a structure is of principal importance in many engineering applications, so the modulus of elasticity is often one of the primary properties considered when selecting a material. A high modulus of elasticity is sought when deflection is undesirable, while a low modulus of elasticity is required when flexibility is needed.

In biology, the stiffness of the extracellular matrix is important for guiding the migration of cells in a phenomenon called durotaxis.

Another application of stiffness finds itself in skin biology. The skin maintains its structure due to its intrinsic tension, contributed to by collagen, an extracellular protein that accounts for approximately 75% of its dry weight. The pliability of skin is a parameter of interest that represents its firmness and extensibility, encompassing characteristics such as elasticity, stiffness, and adherence. These factors are of functional significance to patients. This is of significance to patients with traumatic injuries to the skin, whereby the pliability can be reduced due to the formation and replacement of healthy skin tissue by a pathological scar. This can be evaluated both subjectively, or objectively using a device such as the Cutometer. The Cutometer applies a vacuum to the skin and measures the extent to which it can be vertically distended. These measurements are able to distinguish between healthy skin, normal scarring, and pathological scarring, and the method has been applied within clinical and industrial settings to monitor both pathophysiological sequelae, and the effects of treatments on skin.

<doc id="475010" wikidata="Q737630" url="?curid=475010" title="Reason (short story)">
<text>&quot;Reason&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov, first published in the April 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and collected in &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990). It is part of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series, and was the second of Asimov&#x27;s positronic robot stories to see publication.

==Plot summary==
Powell and Donovan are assigned to a space station which supplies energy via microwave beams to the planets. The robots that control the energy beams are in turn co-ordinated by QT-1, known to Powell and Donovan as Cutie, an advanced model with highly developed reasoning ability. Using these abilities, Cutie decides that space, stars and the planets beyond the station do not really exist, and that the humans that visit the station are unimportant, short-lived and expendable. QT-1 makes the lesser robots disciples of a new religion, which considers the power source of the ship to be &quot;Master&quot;. QT-1 teaches them to bow down to the &quot;Master&quot; and intone, &quot;There is no master but Master, and QT-1 is His prophet.&quot; Disregarding human commands as inferior, QT-1 asserts &quot;I myself, exist, because I think&quot;. The sardonic response of the humans is, &quot;Oh, Jupiter, a robot Descartes!&quot;

The humans initially attempt to reason with QT-1, until they realize that they cannot convince it otherwise. Their attempts to remove Cutie physically also fail, as the other robots have become disciples and refuse to obey human orders. The situation seems desperate, as a solar storm is expected, potentially deflecting the energy beam, incinerating populated areas. When the storm hits, Powell and Donovan are amazed to find that the beam operates perfectly.

Cutie, however, does not believe that they did anything other than maintain meter readings at optimum, according to the commands of The Master. As far as Cutie and the rest of the robots are concerned, solar storms and planets are non-existent. The two thus come to the realization that, although the robots themselves were not consciously aware of doing so, they had been following the first and second laws all along. Cutie knew, on some level, that it would be better suited to operate the controls than Powell or Donavan, so, lest it endanger humans and break the first law by obeying their orders, it subconsciously orchestrated a scenario where it would be in control of the beam. 

Powell and Donovan realize that there is no need to do anything for the rest of their tour of duty. Cutie&#x27;s religion cannot be eliminated, but since the robot performs its job just as well, it is moot, even if Cutie continues to perform his duties for a perceived deity, rather than for the benefit of the humans. The humans begin to consider how they might spread the notion to other groups of robots which need to work as teams.

==Notes==
Asimov wrote &quot;Reason&quot; in October and November 1940. John W. Campbell purchased it on 22 November—his third from Asimov, and the first he did not ask for a revision of—and published it in the April 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The story was broadcast as episode two of a five-part &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; radio adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in February 2017.

In 1967, this short story was adapted into an episode of British television series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; entitled &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Although audio extracts, tele-snaps and production stills exist, the episode itself was wiped and is now considered lost. The robot costumes that were used in this particular episode of the anthology series were later re-used for an episode of &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot; called &quot;The Metal Martyr&quot; (which also doesn&#x27;t exist beyond photographs and audio extracts) and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Mind Robber&quot;. The costumes were re-painted from black to grey and yellow, as they were to be shot against a completely white backdrop for the serial in question.

<text>Royal Air Force Brize Norton or RAF Brize Norton is the largest station of the Royal Air Force. Situated in Oxfordshire, about west north-west of London, it is close to the village of Brize Norton and the towns of Carterton and Witney.

The station is the base for air transport, air-to-air refuelling and military parachuting, with the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Airbus A400M Atlas and Airbus Voyager operating from the station.

Major infrastructure redevelopment began in 2010, ahead of the closure of RAF Lyneham in 2012, and Brize Norton became the sole air point of embarkation for British troops.

==History==
===Royal Air Force===

Construction of RAF Brize Norton began in 1935 with the official opening taking place on 13 August 1937. The station was originally to be named RAF Carterton, given its proximity and relationship with the town of the same name, but was instead named RAF Brize Norton to avoid possible confusion with RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire. The station&#x27;s first unit, No. 2 Flying Training School (No. 2 FTS) transferred from RAF Digby in Lincolnshire on 7 September 1937. On 10 October 1938, No. 2 FTS was joined by No. 6 Maintenance Unit (No. 6 MU).

One of the first operational squadrons to use the airfield was a detachment of No. 110 Squadron which operated from Brize Norton from June 1939 with the Bristol Blenheim Mk.1 and IV. No. 2 FTS was renamed No. 2 Service Flying Training School (No. 2 SFTS) in September 1939, when it re-equipped with the Airspeed Oxford. No. 16 Service Training School, equipped with the North American Harvard, moved to Brize Norton in June 1940. On 16 August, the airfield was attacked by Luftwaffe bombers, with thirty-five Oxfords and eleven Hawker Hurricanes destroyed. No. 16 SFTS left later that year, but No. 2 SFTS and No. 6 MU continued to use the airfield, with No. 1525 Beam Approach Training Flight arriving in February 1942.

The No. 110 Squadron detachment left Brize Norton on 17 March 1942, when the squadron departed for Asia. The two flying training units left on 16 July 1942 to make way for a new user, the Heavy Glider Conversion Unit (HGCU), equipped with Whitley glider tugs and Airspeed Horsa gliders. No. 296 Squadron and No. 297 Squadron both moved in on 14 March 1944 with their Armstrong Whitworth Albemarles, displacing the Heavy Glider Conversion Unit, which moved to RAF North Luffenham. The two Squadrons took part in the Invasion of France on 6 June 1944 and Operation Market Garden in September 1944, before No. 296 Squadron added the Handley Page Halifax Mk.V to their inventory and moved to RAF Earls Colne on 29 September 1944. No. 297 Squadron also moved there a day later.

The HGCU (soon renumbered No. 21 HGCU) returned on 15 October 1944, remaining at Brize Norton until 31 December 1945. The Transport Command Development Unit (TCDU) moved in during 1946, operating a variety of equipment until it departed in June 1949. No. 297 Squadron returned after the Second World War ended, on 5 September 1946 with the Halifax Mk.A.7 and A.9 from RAF Tarrant Rushton, before leaving on 21 August 1947 for RAF Fairford. After the TCDU left in June 1949, No, 2 Squadron of the Central Flying School, equipped with the Harvard, moved in, followed by No. 204 Advanced Flying School, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito, staying at Brize Norton until March and June 1950 respectively.

===United States Air Force===
By 1950, elements of the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) Strategic Air Command (SAC) were based at RAF Lakenheath, RAF Marham, and RAF Sculthorpe. The increasing tension of the Cold War led to a re-evaluation of these deployments. By 1953, SAC bombers began to move further west, behind RAF fighter forces, to Brize Norton, RAF Greenham Common, RAF Upper Heyford, and RAF Fairford. As with the other stations it occupied, SAC invested heavily in extending the runway (), taxiways and dispersals, as well as constructing accommodation and weapons handling facilities. This work was completed in April 1951.

Command of the station was transferred from U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) to SAC on 8 December 1952. 30th Air Depot Wing became the 3rd Air Force unit responsible for control of all personnel at Brize Norton, upon receipt of instructions to control base functions. The station was assigned to the 7th Air Division and operated by the 3920th Air Base Group, which was renamed as the 3920th Combat Support Group, and then the 3920th Strategic Wing in 1964. The 3920th ceased operations in 1965.

The first major USAF deployment was that of twenty-one Convair B-36 Peacemaker strategic bombers of the 11th Bomb Wing for eight days in June 1952. Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the KB-29 air-air tankers of the 301st Bombardment Wing were based at Brize Norton on temporary duty from December 1952 to April 1953.

From September 1953, units equipped with the Boeing B-47E Stratojet six-engined bombers began to be deployed to Brize Norton on 90-day temporary deployments, with boom-equipped Boeing KC-97G Stratofreighters also being deployed in support from December 1954. Brize Norton was closed for runway repairs in 1956. Later deployments included KC-97 and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and the first Convair B-58 Hustler and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers to land in the United Kingdom.

From 1958, B-47 deployments changed from 90-day temporary deployments to 30-day Reflex Alerts, in which the aircraft did little flying, but were held at a high degree of readiness (armed with nuclear bombs) on special aprons on the south side of the airbase. In September 1964, the USAF announced that Reflex operations would cease and that Brize Norton would be returned to the RAF.

===Back to Royal Air Force control===
With RAF Lyneham, the home of RAF Transport Command&#x27;s Bristol Britannia and De Havilland Comet fleets operating at capacity, the planned introduction to RAF service of the Vickers VC10 and Short Belfast created a requirement for an additional major strategic transport airfield. The planned withdrawal of the USAF, its long runway and close proximity to army bases in the south of England, resulted in Brize Norton being selected for the role in 1963.

While the base was formally returned to the RAF on 1 April 1965, the last SAC aircraft, a B-47E of the 380th Bombardment Wing left the base on 3 April, while USAF personnel finally left on 31 May.

Both No. 10 Squadron, equipped with the Vickers VC10 C.1 jet transport and No. 53 Squadron equipped with the Short Belfast C.1 heavy lift turboprop freighter moved from RAF Fairford in May 1967. As facilities at Brize Norton were still unfinished, they used RAF Lyneham as a passenger terminal until October 1968.

In 1970, two squadrons No. 99 Squadron and No. 511 Squadron operating the Bristol Britannia moved from RAF Lyneham. Both squadrons were disbanded in 1976, along with No. 53 Squadron, operating the Short Belfast C.1 In the same year, No. 115 Squadron moved from RAF Cottesmore, operating the Hawker Siddeley Andover in the radar calibration role. The squadron moved to RAF Benson in 1983.

No. 101 Squadron reformed at Brize Norton on 1 May 1984, flying the converted former civil VC-10, heavily modified and updated by British Aerospace for military service as aerial refuelling tankers between 1983 and 1993. Of the thirty-nine airline aircraft acquired by the RAF, thirteen were converted, while the remainder were cannibalised for spare parts. These converted VC-10s were all three-point tankers; capable of refuelling one aircraft (typically another large aircraft) using the main hose or two smaller aircraft using the underwing pods. The variants were designated K.2, K.3 and K.4.

Following the Falklands War, the RAF found itself lacking in the strategic transport capabilities required to sustain the expanded military presence there. As a result, No. 216 Squadron was reformed at Brize Norton in November 1984, initially flying six ex-British Airways Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, followed by three more from Pan-Am.

During August 1995, the Air Traffic Control Centre here reopened following works to the radar and associated equipment costing £1.2 million.

On 23 May 2001, the RAF&#x27;s first C-17A Globemaster III arrived at Brize Norton, one of eight to be delivered to No. 99 Squadron. On 14 October 2005, No. 10 Squadron was disbanded, the aircrew and aircraft being merged with No. 101 Squadron.

Like other UK military bases (for example RAF Fairford, Faslane Naval Base, RAF Lakenheath, and Menwith Hill) RAF Brize Norton has been subject to limited protests by peace demonstrators. During the 2003 Iraq War, four anti-war protesters managed to access the main runway in an attempt to prevent aircraft taking off. A peace camp was held at the station from 21 to 25 April 2005, along with a demonstration in nearby Carterton. On 12 August 2006, campaigners restricted access at the main entrance for several hours in a protest against British foreign policy in the Middle East.

Work to repair and upgrade the runways commenced in April 2007, and repatriation of British personnel was transferred to RAF Lyneham at the same time. With the closure of RAF Lyneham taking place in late 2011, the repatriation transferred back to Brize Norton on 8 September 2011. To accommodate the repatriation services, a purpose-built centre was constructed, and an exit gate was refurbished and formally named the Britannia Gate.

===Redevelopment as a transport base===

Brize Norton was subsequently redeveloped as the major airbase for the RAF&#x27;s transport fleet. The end of flying from RAF Lyneham in September 2011 made Brize Norton the sole &quot;Air Point of Embarkation&quot;, the main operating base for RAF air transport and in-air refuelling aircraft, and home to 15% of RAF uniformed manpower. All the RAF&#x27;s fixed wing transport assets were consolidated at Brize Norton, with the transfer of the entire C-130 Hercules force, together with the entry into service of the Airbus A400M and the A330 Voyager.

To accommodate this expansion (with the number of aircraft stationed at Brize Norton increasing from twenty-eight to sixty-seven), a major infrastructure redevelopment, &quot;Programme Future Brize&quot; was established in 2009. The project involved the overhaul of virtually every element of the airfield&#x27;s infrastructure, including IT, engineering, housing and personnel.

On 25 January 2011, a new station chapel and chaplaincy centre was opened by the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief, The Venerable (Air Vice Marshal) Ray Pentland.

By March 2011, seventy buildings had been refurbished on the station. As part of work to prepare for the introduction of A330 Voyager aircraft into active service, a new hangar and office complex was opened in the same month.

The C-130 Hercules fleet at RAF Lyneham officially moved to Brize Norton on 1 July 2011. The final four aircraft flew to the station, conducting a flypast over Wiltshire. Group Captain John Gladstone, Station Commander of RAF Lyneham, flew the lead Hercules, which carried the standards of the Hercules squadrons. These were presented to the Station Commander of RAF Brize Norton, Group Captain Dom Stamp in a welcoming ceremony.

In February 2012, work started on converting a Second World War era hangar, located north of the main airfield site, into new accommodation for the RAF Tactical Medical Wing (TMW) and No. 4626 (County of Wiltshire) Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron (RAuxAF). The work, which cost £15 million, included provision of a single storey temperature controlled facility within the hangar for the TMW&#x27;s operational stores facilities, office accommodation, a training building and external training area. The facilities opened in July 2013 and allowed the TMW and No. 4626 Squadron to move to Brize Norton from RAF Lyneham.

In February 2014, a Voyager flying from the base suffered an accident. A Voyager with the registration ZZ333 was conducting a ferrying flight from Brize Norton, Carterton to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. On 9 February 2014, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A330 MRTT (A330-243MRTT) had an incident occur over Turkey with multiple nonfatal casualties, forcing the captain to divert the flight to Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey. The cause of the accident was a combination of mismanagement in the military commercial flight space regarding permittance of loose article in the cockpit, limits on the time that a flight can be left with a single pilot during flight, and an atmosphere of boredom and inattentiveness during similar flights due to low workload. There were no deaths but the captain received harsh military punishments and was dismissed from service for his negligence in the incident.

On 25 August 2017, the station&#x27;s Air Movements Squadron subordinated to No. 1 Air Mobility Wing (1AMW), a high readiness unit providing early entry air movements support forming part of the RAF&#x27;s A4 Force which specialises in logistic support for expeditionary air operations.

A new maintenance hangar capable of accommodating three A400M Atlas aircraft was officially opened by Minister for Defence Procurement Guto Bebb on 1 February 2018. The hangar, located on the eastern side of the airfield, cost approximately £70 million and provides 24,000 square metres of floor space.

In September 2018, No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment, which provides protection to the Air Mobility Force, moved to the station from RAF Honington in Suffolk. No. 30 Squadron reformed in September 2021 to operate the A400M Atlas, becoming the second frontline Atlas unit.

On 30 June 2023, after 56 years of RAF service the C-130 Hercules was retired from and No. 47 Squadron disbanded, with the tactical air transport capability transitioning to the A400M Atlas.

==Role and operations==
===Transport operations===

The station is home to approximately 5,800 military staff, 1,200 contractors and 300 civilian staff. The station accommodates the RAF&#x27;s strategic and tactical air transport and air-to-air refuelling fleets, operating the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Airbus A400M Atlas and Airbus A330 MRTT Voyager. The A330 is operated by AirTanker Services under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft contract. AirTanker also operates service to RAF Mount Pleasant, Falkland Islands, on which civilian passengers can book tickets.

Civilian passengers had been permitted on flights to and from RAF Ascension Island with reservations handled by AW Ship Management, with some customers doing package deals combined with the RMS &quot;Saint Helena&quot;, which travelled between Saint Helena and Cape Town, South Africa until the opening of St Helena Airport to passenger flights.

===Expeditionary Air Wing===
No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing was formed at Brize Norton on 1 April 2006 and acts as a deployable command and control headquarters to support Air Mobility Operations.

===Supported units===
The station is home to Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit (JADTEU) – a tri-service unit that tests and evaluates air transportation methods, No.1 Parachute Training School RAF – a training school for airborne forces, and No 1 Air Mobility Wing – an air combat support unit on high readiness to deploy specialist movements personnel worldwide.

== Heritage ==

=== Station badge and motto ===
Brize Norton&#x27;s badge, awarded in January 1968, features a knight&#x27;s helmet with two blue ostrich feathers against the backdrop of an arched castle gateway. The gateway represents the station&#x27;s role as the hub for UK troops and transport aircraft departing on worldwide operations. The helm represents the military personnel carried from the station.

The station&#x27;s motto (&quot;Transire confidenter&quot;) is in Latin and translates into English as &quot;Pass through confidently&quot;, again acknowledging the station&#x27;s gateway role.

=== Gate guardian ===
Unlike many RAF stations, Brize Norton does not have an aircraft on display as a gate guardian. In October 2017 however, a sculpture by local artist David Harber was unveiled to mark the station&#x27;s 80th anniversary. Named &quot;Gate Guardian&quot;, the metal sculpture depicts a globe circled by four of Brize Norton&#x27;s aircraft, an Atlas, a Voyager, a Globemaster and a Hercules.

== Community relations and media ==
RAF Brize Norton enjoys the freedom of Carterton, Exeter, and Torbay.

The station magazine is called &quot;51º North&quot;, in reference to the latitude of Brize Norton (51º 45&#x27;). The magazine is distributed to station personnel, their families and the local community and is available on-line.

The station featured in the 2013 observational documentary series &quot;Inside RAF Brize Norton&quot;. The seven-part series followed activity at the station during 2012 and was shown on Sky One.

The station also hosted parachute training for the cast of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, HBO&#x27;s award-winning miniseries about E (Easy) Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division during the Second World War in Europe, ahead of filming. The parachute training at the station including a wire descent from a jump tower, was the culmination of a 10-day pre-filming boot camp that had begun at Longmoor Military Camp and was included in an official HBO video diary by Ron Livingston (Lewis Nixon).

<doc id="475012" wikidata="Q4931785" url="?curid=475012" title="Bob Bell (actor)">
<text>Robert Lewis Bell (January 18, 1922 – December 8, 1997), better known as Bob Bell, was an American actor and announcer famous for his alter-ego, Bozo the Clown. He was the original portrayer of the character for Chicago superstation WGN-TV.

== Early life ==

Bell was born in Flint, Michigan, to a General Motors factory worker. He spent his life after high school doing odd jobs until he enlisted first in the U.S. Marine Corps and later in the U.S. Navy during World War II, though he did not see any combat action due to the loss of vision in his right eye. Bell was able to pass the induction examination for the Marines by memorizing eye charts. He had a medical discharge from the Marines less than a year after joining in 1941. Bell then went to the navy, where he served in the Pacific Theater until 1946. Before the Marines, Bell worked in movies, taking minor roles and in set construction. Bell was also a baseball player during his Flint high school years, but was limited due to his vision loss. Bell&#x27;s father, George M. Bell, played minor league baseball in the early part of the 20th century.

He broke into broadcasting in Flint as an announcer at local station WMRP (now WWCK), then left for South Bend, Indiana station WHOT. He met his future wife Carolyn while working there. He moved into television with Indianapolis station WFBM-TV (now WRTV) in 1950.

== Cincinnati and Chicago ==

Bell moved on to Cincinnati, Ohio, and WLW Radio and WLWT-TV in 1953. He joined the cast of the Wally Phillips Show and proved to have a gift for comedy, playing numerous characters. After WLW and WLWT&#x27;s executive vice president took a position with Chicago broadcast giants WGN Radio and WGN-TV in 1956, Bell, Phillips and the show&#x27;s writer/director/producer Don Sandburg came along, producing their own variety series, which included &quot;The Wally Phillips Show&quot; and &quot;Midnight Ticker&quot;.

== &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus is on the air!&quot; ==

In 1960, station management asked the character actor and staff announcer to portray Bozo on a live, 30-minute show weekdays at noon, consisting of one-man sketches and cartoons, which debuted on June 20, 1960. The show went on hiatus in January 1961 to move from studios at Tribune Tower to new studios at 2501 West Bradley Place, near the Lane Tech High School campus. Thus, &quot;Bozo&quot; evolved into &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; on September 11, 1961, as a live, hour-long telecast. At the same time Bell was hosting WGN&#x27;s after school Three Stooges show from 1959 where he played an old man named Andy Starr who ran a neighborhood theatre called the Odeon where he showed the Stooges shorts. The show ran for nine years with Bell as the host and also as Bozo.

In 1968, surgery for a brain aneurysm and needed recuperation forced Bell to take a leave of absence from the show. He was able to participate in some broadcasts via telephone, returning to the show again in March 1969. In 1970, Bell received his first Emmy for WGN-TV&#x27;s &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus.&quot; He was also the Grand Marshal for Chicago&#x27;s Christmas Parade in the same year; the number of people who turned out for the parade was estimated at 500,000.

== After Bozo ==

Bell retired from WGN-TV and &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; in 1984, and was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame in 1996. Larry Harmon, who owned the rights to the Bozo the Clown character, refused to congratulate Bell on the honor and also prohibited him from receiving it in costume, as was customary at inductions.

He spent his last years in Lake San Marcos, California, where he was active in the Kiwanis club. Upon his death, he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea. A memorial was held for him at the First Presbyterian Church of Deerfield, where he lived during his many years in Chicago. Bell received many posthumous honors: both the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois proclaimed April 18, 1998, &quot;Bob Bell Day&quot; as the section of Addison Street near the WGN-TV studios was named &quot;Bob Bell Way&quot;. In 2005, the Museum of Broadcast Communications awarded WGN-TV&#x27;s Studio 1 a plaque to commemorate the forty years of children&#x27;s television broadcast from the studio. &quot;Ray Rayner and Friends&quot; with a likeness of Rayner and Chelveston, is on the plaque along with Frazier Thomas and &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot; and Bob Bell as Bozo the Clown for &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;. In 2008, he was inducted into the Chicago chapter of the National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences&#x27; Silver Circle. One of Bell&#x27;s Bozo costumes is part of the &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; collection of the Museum of Broadcast Communications.

Bell&#x27;s grandson, Trevor Bell, became a member of the Major League Baseball team Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005.

Bell’s voice was the inspiration for the voice of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; character Krusty the Clown.

<text>Royal Air Force Fairford or more simply RAF Fairford is a Royal Air Force (RAF) station in Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. While being an RAF station, Fairford hosts United States Air Force personnel. Since 2019, the base has played host to a Lockheed U-2S Dragon Lady detachment from the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. It is the USAF&#x27;s only European airfield for heavy bombers and routinely supports Bomber Task Force (BTF) operations. Its most prominent use in recent years has been as an airfield for United States Air Force B-52s during the 2003 Iraq War, Operation Allied Force in 1999, and the first Gulf War in 1991. 

RAF Fairford was the only TransOceanic Abort Landing site for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle in the UK. As well as having a sufficiently long runway for a shuttle landing (the runway is long), it also had NASA-trained fire and medical crews stationed on the airfield. The runway is rated with an unrestricted load-bearing capacity, meaning that it can support any aircraft with any type of load.

RAF Fairford is also the home of the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), an annual air display. RIAT is one of the largest airshows in the world, with the 2003 show recognised by Guinness World Records as the largest military airshow ever, with an attendance of 535 aircraft.

==History==

===Second World War===

Construction started in 1943 as part of a programme to open fourteen airfields in southern England to be used by British and American troop carrier transports and gliders. The station opened on 18 January 1944. Initially intended to be operated by the United States forces, the first occupants arrived on 18 March when the Royal Air Force&#x27;s No.620 Squadron equipped with the Short Stirling Mk.IV moved from RAF Leicester East, soon to be accompanied on 25 March by No. 190 Squadron also operating the Stirling. The aircraft were used for airborne forces operations, performing parachute drops of troops and supplies and towing Airspeed Horsa assault gliders. Troop carriers and gliders from Fairford were used for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. The RAF used it to lift British troops for Operation Market Garden.

The following units were also here at some point:
=== Cold War ===
In the early years of the Cold War the British and American governments reached an agreement under which elements of the USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) would be based in the UK. Bases had already been established in East Anglia, at RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath, but they were considered to be vulnerable to bomber attack and airfields further behind the RAF fighter defences were sought. Four RAF airfields were selected to receive SAC units: RAF Brize Norton, RAF Fairford, RAF Greenham Common and RAF Upper Heyford. In 1948 the Americans occupied RAF stations including Fairford, Brize Norton, Burtonwood, Greenham Common, Mildenhall, Lakenheath and Woodbridge to build up a deterrent in Europe against the Soviets.
 RAF Lyneham&#x27;s position as the primary tactical transport base for the RAF was emphasised in February 1971 when Nos. 30 and 47 Squadrons were transferred from their old base at RAF Fairford. In 1965, RAF Fairford was the first home base of the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team The Red Arrows.

In 1950, as a result of the beginning of the Cold War, the airfield was transferred to the United States Air Force for strategic bomber operations. A runway was constructed for long-range bomber operations.

The runway was completed in 1953, and served as a forward airbase for the first Convair B-36 Peacemaker aircraft from Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. The airfield later received B-47s which were maintained at a heightened state of alert because of increased tensions with the Soviet Union.

Due to the long runway Fairford was chosen in 1969 as the British test centre for the Concorde aircraft until 1977.

The U.S. Air Force returned with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers deployed on rotation from the many KC-135 bases in the USA. On 15 November 1978 the 11th Strategic Group (11 SG) was activated at RAF Fairford. It was not manned until the following February and used KC-135 aircraft and crews from SAC, Air National Guard, and AF Reserve units until the 11 SG received its own aircraft in September 1979. It soon began aerial refueling support for all USAF operations, deployments and redeployments, as well as participating in NATO exercises.

Operations staff and maintenance personnel were permanently assigned, but aircraft, aircrews and crew chiefs were temporarily assigned to the 11th Strategic Group for the European Tanker Task Force on rotation. Aircraft and crews operated from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Keflavik, Iceland; Zaragosa, Spain; Lajes Field, Azores; Sigonella NAS, Italy; and Hellenikon, Greece. The unit retained the 11th Strategic Group designation, but was inactivated on 7 August 1990.

KC-135 and KC-10 tankers deployed to Fairford supported Operation El Dorado Canyon against Libya in 1986. The KC-135s and KC-10s were withdrawn in 1990 and the station was returned to standby status, upgraded to &#x27;limited use&#x27; in the mid-1990s.

Due to RAF Fairford&#x27;s location and infrastructure, the airfield is designated as a forward operating location for the US Air Force. It was used in the first Gulf War in 1991, with B-52s and KC-135s from Eaker AFB in Arkansas. It was later used during Operation Allied Force in 1999 when B-52s from Barksdale AFB, B-1Bs from Ellsworth AFB and KC-135s from Mountain Home AFB were used.

=== 21st century ===
In the 2003 Iraq War, Operation Iraqi Freedom included B-52s based at Minot AFB but flying from Fairford. In recent years the airfield has been occasionally used by American B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and is frequently visited by U-2 aircraft.

Due to the deteriorating airfield facilities and its unique NATO heavy bomber mission, RAF Fairford underwent a $100 million upgrade of its runway and fuel systems in the largest NATO funded airfield construction project within a NATO country since the end of the Cold War. This work lasted from May 2000 through May 2002. Additional improvements continued until 2008, including the construction of two climate-controlled hangars for B-2 stealth bombers and a low-observability maintenance dock.

On 14 January 2004, the 420th Air Base Group (420 ABG) was established at RAF Fairford to improve the control of its geographically separated units (GSUs) that had been aligned beneath the 100th Air Refueling Wing at RAF Mildenhall. These units are assigned to airfields at RAF Fairford, RAF Croughton, RAF Alconbury, and RAF Molesworth. The 420 ABG reported directly to Third Air Force until 26 May 2004, when the 38th Combat Support Wing (38 CSW) was established at Sembach Annex, Germany.

The construction of two climate-controlled hangars was completed in December 2004. At a cost of £ million ($19 million), the hangars were designed to accommodate the B-2A Spirit and allow for maintenance of its specialist low-observable coating.

On 12 May 2005, USAFE activated the 501st Combat Support Wing, with headquarters at RAF Alconbury, to provide support to its GSUs in the United Kingdom.

In 2010 USAF withdrew all its uniformed staff from the station by September 2010 leaving a civilian operating unit to maintain the base on a &quot;care and maintenance&quot; basis. However the base remains a designated standby airfield for heavy bomber operations, capable of immediate reactivation within 24–48 hours and it continues to host the Royal International Air Tattoo every July.

In September 2014 Fairford was used as the staging base for US President Obama&#x27;s trip to the NATO conference held in Newport, Wales. VC-25A &quot;Air Force 1&quot; (AF1) aircraft carrying the President and his entourage and support aircraft arrived on 3 September, the US Secretary of State John Kerry also arrived in his own USAF C-32 aircraft. Air Force One with President Obama departed for Washington 5 September after an &#x27;impromptu&#x27; visit to Stonehenge on his way from Newport back to RAF Fairford.
Since June 2014 RAF Fairford has seen regular heavy bomber exercises return with B-52H, B-2A and in September 2016, B-1B aircraft for short duration exercises by Air Force Global Strike Command and US Air Force Reserve units from Barksdale, Minot, Whiteman and Dyess Air Force Bases. These exercises include participation in NATO exercises Baltops, Saber Strike and Ample Strike. Baltops, mainly a maritime exercise, takes place off the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, while Saber Strike saw the B-52s flying close air support missions in Poland. Taking advantage of B-52 deployment in 2014 were two flights of two B-2 Spirits, which made brief visits to Fairford as part of Global Power training flights. The Ample Strike exercise in September 2016 was the first time that US Air Force Reserve had deployed two types of heavy bombers (B-1Bs and B-52Hs) under the same parent operating Wing (307BW). March 2019 saw the largest deployment of B-52Hs to RAF Fairford since Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, when six bombers arrived from the 2nd Bomb Wing.

In November 2018, it was announced that the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron and 488th Intelligence Squadron would relocate to Fairford by 2024. The squadrons, based at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, are both part of the 55th Operations Group and support Boeing RC-135 surveillance aircraft when forward deployed on temporary duty to the UK from the United States. The move, part of the US Department of Defense&#x27;s European Infrastructure Consolidation programme, was expected to see 500 personnel and RC-135 operations transfer to Fairford. However, in December the proposal was cancelled and it was confirmed that Mildenhall would be retained as the RC-135&#x27;s UK operating location.

In September 2019, the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron (99th ERS) began a Lockheed U-2S Dragon Lady detachment from Beale Air Force Base, California.

On 22 August 2020, six B-52H bombers from the 23rd Bomb Squadron, 5th Bomb Wing, Minot AFB deployed to RAF Fairford for a series of exercises with NATO and allied countries. On 28 August 2020, in a single-day mission dubbed &#x27;Allied Sky&#x27;, B-52Hs overflew all 30 NATO countries; four of the six B-52Hs deployed at RAF Fairford flew the European portion whilst two Minot-based B-52Hs flew over the United States and Canada.

The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) acquired of land to north east of RAF Fairford in November 2000. Planning permission was granted August 2021 to allow the land to be incorporated into the station boundary. Previously part of Horcott Quarry, the land forms part of the Cotswold Water Park lake system which is designated as a site of special scientific interest. The DIO indicated that the land would be used to enhance station security and improve bird hazard management, as well as for military exercises and recreation.

Between December 2021 and December 2022, work was undertaken to resurface taxiways and aircraft parking stands located in the north eastern part of the airfield. Over 1,200m of taxiway surfacing was replaced, with two parking stands removed and eleven replaced. Drainage infrastructure and airfield ground lighting were also upgraded.

In February 2022, four B-52H bombers from the 69th Bomb Squadron were deployed to RAF Fairford for six weeks.

In August 2024, a Northrop Grumman RQ-4B Global Hawk deployed to and operated from RAF Fairford for the first time.

== Role and operations ==
=== Ownership and administration ===
RAF Fairford is owned by the British Ministry of Defence. Although designated as an RAF station, it is made available to the US Department of Defense under the 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement and other arrangements. The use of the station for combat operations is a joint decision between the British and US governments.

=== Security ===
Security outside the perimeter of the station is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence Police, whereas security within the station is provided by the US Visiting Forces.

On 1 April 2006, RAF Fairford was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the station.

=== Operations ===
RAF Fairford is a Forward Operating Location made available to the United States by the UK Government. It is the only bomber forward operating location in Europe and is predominately used by US Air Force deployments of the B-1B Lancer, B-2A Spirit and B-52H Stratofortress aircraft taking part in Air Force Global Strike Command&#x27;s Bomber Task Force missions.

The US Air Force&#x27;s 421st Air Base Squadron provides Menwith Hill with base and mission support services. The squadron is part of the 423rd Air Base Group which in turn is part of the 501st Combat Support Wing, both of which have their headquarters at RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.

Since September 2019, Fairford has hosted a detachment of U-2S Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft, operated by the 99th ERS.

Base and mission support is provided by the 420th Air Base Squadron, a Geographically Separate Unit of the 501st Combat Support Wing based at RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.

<doc id="475014" wikidata="Q90027" url="?curid=475014" title="German-speaking Community of Belgium">
<text>The German-speaking Community (, , DG), also known as East Belgium ( ), is one of the three federal communities of Belgium. The community is composed of nine municipalities in Liège Province, Wallonia, within the Eupen-Malmedy region in Eastern Belgium. The primary language of the community is German, making this one of the three official languages in Belgium. Traditionally the community and the wider area around it forms an intersection of various local languages and/or dialects, namely Limburgish, Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian varieties. The community has an area of , and has a population of around 79,000 (as of January 2024)about 7.0% of Liège Province and about 0.7% of the national total.

Bordering the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, the area has its own parliament and government at Eupen. The German-speaking Community of Belgium was annexed in 1920 from Germany. There are also some other areas where German is spoken that belonged to Belgium before 1920, but these are not part of the German-speaking Community. This category includes the Bleiberg-Welkenraedt-Baelen area in the northeastern part of the province of Liège, as well as Arelerland (the city of Arlon and some nearby villages in the southeastern portion of the province of Belgian Luxembourg). However, German is declining in these areas outside of the core German-speaking Community due to the expansion of French.

== History ==
The area known today as the East Cantons consists of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes (), which belong to the French Community of Belgium. The East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in the German Empire until 1920 (as the counties (Landkreise) of Eupen and Malmedy), but were annexed by Belgium following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles. Thus they also became known as the &quot;&quot;, &quot;redeemed cantons&quot;. The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the &quot;questioning&quot; of the local population. People who were unwilling to become Belgians and wanted the region to remain a part of Germany were required to register themselves along with their full name and address with the Belgian military administration, headed by Herman Baltia, and many feared reprisals or even expulsion for doing so.

In the mid-1920s, there were secret negotiations between Germany and the kingdom of Belgium that seemed to be inclined to sell the region back to Germany as a way to improve Belgium&#x27;s finances. A price of 200 million gold marks has been mentioned. At this point, the French government, fearing for the stability of the broader postwar order, intervened with Brussels and the Belgian-German talks were called off.

The new cantons had been part of Belgium for just 20 years when, in 1940, they were retaken by Germany in World War II. The majority of people of the east cantons welcomed this as they considered themselves German. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the cantons were once again annexed by Belgium, and as a result of alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany an attempt was made to de-Germanize the local population by the Belgian and Walloon authorities.

In the early 1960s, Belgium was divided into four linguistic areas, the Dutch-speaking Flemish area, the French-speaking area, the bilingual capital of Brussels, and the German-speaking area of the east cantons. In 1973, three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy. The legislative Parliament of the German-speaking Community, &quot;&quot;, was set up. Today the German-speaking Community has a fair degree of autonomy, especially in language and cultural matters, but it still remains part of the region of predominantly French-speaking Wallonia. There has been much argument in the past few years that the German-speaking Community should also become its own region, which is an ongoing process with the permanent transfer with the previous accord of some competences concerning social policy, conservation of sites and monuments, environment protection policy, transport, the financing of municipalities, among other things from the Walloon Region. One of the proponents of full regional autonomy for the German-speaking Community is Karl-Heinz Lambertz, the minister-president from 1999 to 2014. According to the government of the German-speaking Community, special consideration should be given to regional autonomy for spatial planning, city building, and housing.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

The territory of the German-speaking Community is bounded on the north by the Belgium-Germany-Netherlands border tripoint, on the east by Germany and on the south by Luxembourg, and on the west by the territory of the French-speaking Community of Belgium.

Within Belgium, the German-speaking Community exercises its political powers on the German-speaking territory, which comprises nine municipalities. Eupen is the seat of the government, the parliament and the administrative centre.

The municipalities of Malmedy and Weismes belong to the territorial community of the French Community of Belgium. The German minority has its own rights there. Occasionally, the nine German-speaking communities, together with the communities of Malmedy and Weismes, are historically called East Belgium or East Cantons because of their common political past, formerly also as Eupen-Malmedy-St. Vith.

In March 2017, the government of the German-speaking community decided to market the area as East Belgium. Analogous to South Tyrol (officially: Autonomous Region of Bolzano – South Tyrol), the name of the German-speaking Community of Belgium will continue to be used on official documents, on the external presentation, on the Internet and on the official posters of the ministry, the government and the parliament.

== Government ==
The German-speaking Community has its own government, which is appointed for five years by its own parliament. The Government is headed by a Minister-President, who acts as the &quot;prime minister&quot; of the Community, and is assisted by the Ministry of the German-speaking Community. The 2024–2029 government is formed by four Ministers:
* Oliver Paasch (ProDG), Minister-President and Minister for Local Government
* Gregor Freches (PFF), Minister for Culture, Media and Tourism
* Lydia Klinkenberg (ProDG), Minister for Family, Social Affairs, Housing and Health
* Jérôme Franssen (CSP), Minister for Education, Training and Employment

=== Municipalities ===
The German-speaking Community consists of nine municipalities, listed in the table below. Numbers on the map to the right correspond to the &quot;Map #&quot; column in the table below.

( = comparable to previous year).

The population figures are those on 1 January 2020 (compare to a total of 73,675 on 1 January 2007). The municipalities are grouped into two cantons, namely the Canton of Eupen in the north and the Canton of Sankt Vith in the south. The wider region is included in the Arrondissement of Verviers.

== Demographics ==

In 2007, 73,675 inhabitants (86.3 inhabitants / km2) lived in the area of the German-speaking community. However, the population density in the canton of Eupen (north) and the canton of St. Vith (south) is very different:

*District of Eupen: 44 159 inhabitants – 196.4 inhabitants / km2.
*District of St. Vith: 29 516 inhabitants – 46.9 inhabitants / km2
The North-South demographic gap is particularly evident when comparing the North and South of the community:

*The most densely populated municipality is Kelmis (577.9 inhabitants / km2);
*The least densely populated municipality is Büllingen (36.2 inhabitants / km2).
By comparison, the population density is 346.7 in Belgium, 204.0 in Wallonia and 452.4 in Flanders. Men represent 49.72% with a slightly lower proportion of the total population of the German-speaking community, women are in the majority with 50.28%.

As of 2020 over 21% of the community is foreign-born, with Germans representing the overwhelming majority of that group.

<doc id="475015" wikidata="Q601919" url="?curid=475015" title="Catch That Rabbit">
<text>&quot;Catch that Rabbit&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the February 1944 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982).

==Plot summary==
The recurring team of Powell and Donovan are testing a new model of robot on an asteroid mining station. This DV-5 (Dave) has six subsidiary robots, described as &quot;fingers&quot;, which it controls via positronic fields, a means of transmission not yet fully understood by roboticists. When the humans are not in contact, the robot stops producing ore. It cannot recall the time periods when it stops mining, and states that it finds this just as puzzling as the humans do.

Powell and Donovan secretly observe the robot without its knowledge. It starts performing strange marches and dances with its subsidiaries whenever something unexpected happens—an early example of a Heisenbug (software problem). To learn more, the humans try to create an emergency situation around the robot in order to observe the precise moment of malfunction, but accidentally trap themselves in a cave-in. They eventually figure that the main robot has too many subsidiaries. The &quot;fingers&quot; function independently until there is a serious need of decisiveness, when the main brain has to assume 6-way-control of all &quot;fingers&quot;, which requires an excess of initiative and causes overload. When the humans were watching, their presence reduced the initiative placed on the robot&#x27;s mind, and it would not break down. To get themselves rescued, the humans shoot and destroy one of the subsidiaries. The main robotic brain can cope with five-way control, hence the robots stop dancing and the First Law takes over.

Powell anthropomorphises the error as the robot twiddling its &quot;fingers&quot; whenever it becomes overwhelmed by its job. This is another example of Asimov&#x27;s writing of robopsychology—personified by Susan Calvin—as running parallel to human psychology. At this point in &quot;I, Robot&quot;, the reader has already seen hysteria and religious mania.

<doc id="475016" wikidata="Q2708318" url="?curid=475016" title="Cantonese opera">
<text>Cantonese opera is one of the major categories in Chinese opera, originating in southern China&#x27;s Guangdong Province. It is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and among Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting.

==History==
There is debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in the late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or &quot;Southern drama&quot;, which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south.

Many well-known operas performed today, such as &quot;Tai Nui Fa&quot; originated in the Ming Dynasty and &quot;The Purple Hairpin&quot; originated in the Yuan Dynasty, with lyrics and scripts in Cantonese. Until the 20th century all the female roles were performed by males.
===Early development in Shanghai===
In the 1840s, a large number of Guangdong businessmen came to Shanghai for opportunities. They owned abundant resources, therefore, their influence in Shanghai has gradually increased (Song, 1994). Later, various clansmen associations have been established to sponsor different cultural activities, Cantonese opera was one of them. From the 1920s to the 1930s, the development of Cantonese opera in Shanghai was very impressive (Chong, 2014). At that time, the department stores opened by the Cantonese businessmen in Shanghai had their Cantonese opera theater companies. Moreover, the Guangdong literati in Shanghai always put great effort into promotions of Guangdong opera. A newspaper recorded that &quot;The Cantonese operas were frequently played at that time. And the actors who came to perform in Shanghai were very famous. Every time many Cantonese merchants made reservations for inviting their guests to enjoy the opera&quot;.(Cheng, 2007)

===Development in Hong Kong===
Beginning in the 1950s immigrants fled Shanghai to areas such as North Point. Their arrival significantly boosted the Cantonese opera fan-base. Also, the Chinese Government wanted to deliver the message of socialist revolution to Chinese people under colonial governance in Hong Kong. Agents of the Chinese government founded newspaper platforms, such as Ta Kung Pao () and Chang Cheung Hua Pao () to promote Cantonese Opera to the Hong Kong audience. These new platforms were used to promote new Cantonese Opera releases. This helped to boost the popularity of Cantonese Opera among the Hong Kong audience. Gradually, Cantonese Opera became a part of daily entertainment activity in the colony.

The popularity of a Cantonese Opera continued to grow during the 1960s. More theatres were established in Sheung Wan and Sai Wan, which became important entertainment districts. Later, performances began to be held in playgrounds, which provided more opportunities to develop Cantonese Opera in Hong Kong. As the variety of venues grew, so the variety of audiences became wider. However, Cantonese Opera began to decline as TV and cinema started to develop in the late 1960s. Compared to Cantonese Opera, cinema was cheaper and TV was more convenient. Subsequently, some theatres started to be repurposed as commercial or residential buildings. The resulting decline in available theatres further contributed to the decline of Cantonese Opera in the territory.

Since the demolition of Lee Theatre and the closing down of many stages (Tai Ping Theatre, Ko Shing Theatre, Paladium Theatre, Astor Theatre or former Po Hing Theatre, Kai Tak Amusement Park and Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park) that were dedicated to Cantonese genre throughout the decades, Hong Kong&#x27;s Sunbeam Theatre is one of the last facilities that is still standing to exhibit Cantonese Opera.

By the early 1980s, Leung Hon-wai was one of the first in his generation of the Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong (hkbarwo) who gave classes and actively engaged in talent-hunting. The Cantonese Opera Academy of Hong Kong classes started in 1980.

To intensify education in Cantonese opera, they started to run an evening part-time certificate course in Cantonese Opera training with assistance from The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts in 1998. In 1999, the Association and the Academy further conducted a two-year daytime diploma programme in performing arts in Cantonese Opera in order to train professional actors and actresses. Aiming at further raising the students&#x27; level, the Association and the Academy launched an advanced course in Cantonese opera in the next academic year.

In recent years, the Hong Kong Arts Development Council has given grants to the Love and Faith Cantonese Opera Laboratory to conduct Cantonese opera classes for children and young people. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department has also funded the International Association of Theatre Critics (Hong Kong Branch) to implement the &quot;Cultural Envoy Scheme for Cantonese Opera&quot; for promoting traditional Chinese productions in the community.

Also, the Hong Kong Government planned to promote Cantonese Opera through different communication channels. They wanted to build more theatres for the Hong Kong public to have more opportunities to enjoy Cantonese Opera. The scheme also arrived to develop professional talents in Cantonese Opera. Cantonese Opera became a part of the compulsory Music subject in primary school. For teachers, the Education Bureau provided some training and teaching materials related to Cantonese Opera.

===Art festivals===
In the first decade of the Hong Kong Arts Festivals and the Festivals of Asian Arts, Cantonese opera performances contributed by those representing the lion share of the market, (well-established troupes, well-known performers Lang Chi Bak as well as Leung Sing Poh in their golden years or prominent performers in their prime) are:-

Obscure groups of experimental nature, let alone those late boomers without market value, were not on the map or in the mind of those organizing these events. That changed since the 40 something Leung Hon-wai found his way to the stepping stone or launching pad he desired for pet projects of various nature.

===Public funding===

To continue the tradition by passing on what elders and veterans inherited from former generations and to improve sustainability with new and original music, lyrics and scripts. 
*Cantonese Opera Development Fund
*Hong Kong Arts Development Council, Grants

Heritage is as abstract a concept as traditions is while monetary support is real. However, elders are not ombudspersons in any sense and they take public funds for their own reasons. That is, they are knee deep in commercial performances even as a member of the above organizations.

A juren a century ago can be an adjunct associate professor now in Hong Kong. How business was conducted in a community by a juren was illustrated by Ma Sze Tsang in a film called the &quot;Big Thunderstorm (1954)&quot;.

Trend-setting figure, Leung Hon-wai, talked on camera about his doctrine related to new titles he wrote and monetary backings from the various Hong Kong authorities. That is, &quot;art festivals&quot; provided him financial means, identity, advertising resources and opportunities not otherwise available. Curious audience makes good box-office for the only 2–3 shows of a single new title. In addition, he only paid 50% to collect the new costumes in his possession for future performances of different titles.

A Sit Kok Sin classic fetched HK$105,200 plus in 2015. The parents who had over 100 years of experience combined found sharing the stage with their son as not feasible without subsidies for Golden Will Chinese Opera Association and Wan Fai-yin, Christina.

&quot;Time To Go Home&quot; is different from those Leung debuted at arts festivals since:-
#This 1939 Sit classic has been a rite of passage for new performers to become prominent male leads.
#It only involves minimum costumes, props and crew size.
#It is popular as afternoon fillers by third tier performers in bamboo theaters.

In 2019, Yuen Siu Fai talked on radio that he found the readily available funding made beneficiaries financially irresponsible, unlike himself and others who put their own money where their mouths were. Yuen, who works regularly for troupes with secure public funding, did not draw a link between his two roles.

Contrary to Africa, the &quot;entire village&quot; is responsible for raising the children of a certain crowd only. Both political and social &quot;guanxi&quot; is making or breaking the future of up-and-coming performers in the same way as whether Bak Yuk Tong is remembered as one of the Four Super Stars or not. According to Yuen, Bak is anti-communist and therefore his status is different in Mainland China (PRC).

===Crowdfunding===

===Private funding===
*The Art of Fong Yim-fun Sustainability Project, Shaw College, CUHK. In August 2014, the Fong Yim Fun Art Gallery was formally opened.
* Dr. Yang Leung Yin-fong Katie, the Honorary Life Chairman, donated one of her properties to be the permanent office of the Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong to provide residences for aged musicians.

===Jumping the shark===
In 2019, Yuen Siu Fai said that old performers are to stay front and center on stage as long as they want to take center stage instead of sharing, let alone ceding, the limelight to the next or even younger generations. Yuen insists that performers without bags under their eyes could not be any good.

In 2018, Law Kar Ying said Chan Kam Tong had already &quot;jumped the shark&quot; in the mid-1950s, more than ten years before Chan actually left the stage or more than 60 years for it to be confirmed to the public. The (Yuen, Law and others) generation with bags under their eyes picked up where Leung left off. By such, these old performers are upholding the Chan tradition and making up records along the way. However, the Chan caliber of masters needed no directors.

Two performers Chan worked with closely, who definitely left the stage at will with dignity, are Yam Kim Fai and Fong Yim Fun. They both openly rebuked (in 1969 and in 1987 respectively in no harsher way than what Lam Kar Sing and his wife did in 1983) individual off-springs who were under their wings briefly but officially. The popularity of Yam-Fong in Hong Kong continues to thrive notwithstanding their apparent lack of official successors as Loong Kim Sang and Lee Bo Ying picked up where they left off.

Cantonese opera in Hong Kong rocketed around 1985/86, according to Li Jian, born Lai Po Yu, (), an observer. De facto successors to master performers, Lee Bo Ying, Lam Kar Sing, and Loong Kim Sang all left the stage in or before 1993, last watershed moment of Cantonese opera for Hong Kong and beyond in the 20th century. The consequences are also significant and long lasting. Unlike Fong and Loong, Yam and Lee never returned.

For the rest of her life, Yam didn&#x27;t even take the bow at curtain calls although she was in the audience on most days that Loong&#x27;s troupe performed in Hong Kong. Comfortable enough around Yam, Yuen called Yam lazy because she did not comment on some cake served backstage in those days.

===All for naught===
Local Teochew opera troupes lost their ground regarding live-on-stage Ghost Festival opera performances when the business environment was destroyed. Since then, the Teochew category disappeared in Hong Kong.

Chan Kim-seng, the former chairperson of Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong, saw similar threats towards Cantonese opera and fought &quot;tooth and nail&quot; for job security of members. Chan, Representative Inheritor of Cantonese opera in the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, passed away on 19 August 2013.

==Characteristics==
Cantonese opera shares many common characteristics with other Chinese theatre genres. Commentators often take pride in the idea that all Chinese theatre styles are similar but with minor variations on the pan-Chinese music-theatre tradition and the basic features or principles are consistent from one local performance form to another. Thus, music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics and acting are all featured in Cantonese opera. Most of the plots are based on Chinese history and famous Chinese classics and myths. Also, the culture and philosophies of the Chinese people can be seen in the plays. Virtues (like loyalty, love, patriotism and faithfulness) are often reflected by the operas.

Some particular features of Cantonese opera are:
#Cing sik sing (程式性; &quot;Jyutping&quot;: cing4 sik1 sing3) – formulaic, formalised.
#Heoi ji sing (虛擬性; &quot;Jyutping&quot;: heoi1 ji5 sing3) – abstraction of reality, distancing from reality.
#Sin ming sing (鮮明性; &quot;Jyutping&quot;: sin1 ming4 sing3) – clear-cut, distinct, unambiguous, well-defined.
#Zung hap ngai seot jing sik (綜合藝術形式; &quot;Jyutping&quot;: zung3 hap6 ngai6 seot6 jing4 sik1) – a composite or synthetic art form.
#Sei gung ng faat (四功五法; &quot;Pinyin&quot;: sì gōng wǔ fǎ, &quot;Jyutping&quot;: sei3 gung1 ng5 faat3) – the four skills and the five methods.

The &quot;four skills&quot; and &quot;five methods&quot; are a simple codification of training areas that theatre performers must master and a metaphor for the most well-rounded and thoroughly-trained performers. The &quot;four skills&quot; apply to the whole spectrum of vocal and dramatic training: singing, acting/movements, speech delivery, and martial/gymnastic skills; while the &quot;five methods&quot; are categories of techniques associated with specific body parts: hands, eyes, body, hair, and feet/walking techniques.

The acting, acrobat, music and singing, live on stage, are well known as essential characteristics of &quot;live&quot; performances in theaters. Recordings did not replace the human voice backstage behind prop only when choir members were actually introduced to the audience at curtain call.

==Significance==
Before widespread formal education, Cantonese opera taught morals and messages to its audiences rather than being solely entertainment. The government used theatre to promote the idea of &quot;be loyal to the emperor and love the country&quot; (). Thus, the government examined the theatre frequently and would ban any theatre if a harmful message was conveyed or considered. The research conducted by Lo showed that Cantonese Operatic Singing also relates older people to a sense of collectivism, thereby contributing to the maintenance of interpersonal relationships and promoting successful ageing. (Lo, 2014). Young people construct the rituals of learning Cantonese opera as an important context for their personal development.

==Operas of Deities==

Cantonese opera is a kind of Operas of Deities. Operas for Deities are often performed in celebration of folk festivals, birthdays of deities, establishments or renovations of altars and temples. A community organises a performance of opera, which is used to celebrate the birth of the gods or to cooperate with the martial arts activities, such as &quot;Entertaining People and Entertaining God&quot; and &quot;God and People&quot;. These performances can be called &quot; Operas for Deities &quot;. This king of acting originated from the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty. It was also called the sacred drama in the performance of God&#x27;s birthday. It is a meritorious deed for God. According to the study, most of the Cantonese operas in Hong Kong belong to the Operas for Deities, and the nature of the preparations of the &quot;God Circus&quot; can be broadly divided into three categories: the celebration of the gods, the Hungry Ghost Festival, the Taiping Qing Dynasty, the temple opening and the traditional festival celebrations. In the 1960s−1970s, the Chinese opera was at a low ebb. However, due to the support of Opera for Deities, some of the troupes can be continue to perform. In the 1990s, the total performance rate of Operas for Deities has been reduced from two-thirds to two-fifths in the 1980s, there is no such thing as a performance in the Cantonese opera industry.

==Performers and roles==

===Types of play===
There are two types of Cantonese opera plays: &quot;Mou&quot; (武, &quot;martial arts&quot;) and &quot;Man&quot; (文, &quot;highly educated&quot;, esp. in poetry and culture). &quot;Mou&quot; plays emphasize war, the characters usually being generals or warriors. These works contain action scenes and involve a lot of weaponry and armour. &quot;Man&quot; plays tend to be gentler and more elegant. Scholars are the main characters in these plays. Water sleeves are used extensively in &quot;man&quot; plays to produce movements reflecting the elegance and tenderness of the characters; all female characters wear them. In &quot;man&quot; plays, characters put a lot of effort into creating distinctive facial expressions and gestures to express their underlying emotions.

===Roles===
There are four types of roles: Sang (Sheng), Daan (Dan), Zing (Jing), and Cau (Chou).

====Sang====
The Sang (; Sheng) are male roles. As in other Chinese operas, there are different types of male roles, such as:
*Siu2 Sang1 () – Literally, &quot;young gentleman&quot;, this role is known as a young scholar.
*Mou5 Sang1 () – Male warrior role.
*Siu2 Mou5 Sang1 () – Young Warrior (usually not lead actor but a more acrobatic role).

Actresses for close to a century, of three generations and with huge successes worldwide, usually perform this male role are Yam Kim Fai (mentor and first generation), Loong Kim Sang (protégée and second generation), Koi Ming Fai and Lau Wai Ming (the two youngest listed below both by age and by experience).
*Lou5 Sang1 () – Old man role.
*Sou1 Sang1 () – Bearded role

====Daan====
The Daan (旦; Dan) are female roles. The different forms of female characters are:

== Notable people ==
=== Major Cantonese Opera artists ===
Major Cantonese Opera (Stage) Career Artists include:

* nurtured generation.

Political-economic crisis led to overall very hard time for Cantonese Opera in Hong Kong. Early 1960s, a sole proprietor in private sector built and operated this facility to provide performance venue, similar (in purpose) to the current Yau Ma Tei Theatre, in which upcoming artists could attain stage experience. Volunteers who managed this Amusement Park Theatre were veteran performer with his wife and others. Work opportunities and incomes nurtured these young promising performers for years.

==Visual elements==

===Makeup===
Applying makeup for Cantonese opera is a long and specialized process. One of the most common styles is the &quot;white and red face&quot;: an application of white foundation and a red color around the eyes that fades down to the bottom of cheeks. The eyebrows are black and sometimes elongated. Usually, female characters have thinner eyebrows than males. There is black makeup around the eyes with a shape similar to the eyes of a Chinese phoenix (鳳眼; fung6 ngaan5). Lipstick is usually bright red (口唇膏; hau2 seon4 gou1).

A female-role actress is in the processes of applying her markup: spreading a creamy. foundation on her cheeks and forehead; putting blusher on her cheeks, eyelids and both sides of the nose; darling her eyebrows and drawing eye-lines and eye-shadows; pasting hairpieces around her face to create an oval-shaped look; lipstick has been put on prior to this; placing hairpins on the hairpiece.

Actors are given temporary facelifts by holding the skin up with a ribbon on the back of the head. This lifts the corners of the eyes, producing an authoritative look.

Each role has its own style of make-up: the clown has a large white spot in the middle of his face, for example. A sick character has a thin red line pointing upwards in between his eyebrows. Aggressive and frustrated character roles often have an arrow shape fading into the forehead in between the eyebrows (英雄脂; jing1 hung4 zi1).

Strong male characters wear &quot;open face&quot; (開面; hoi1 min4) makeup. Each character&#x27;s makeup has its own distinct characteristics, with symbolic patterns and coloration.

===Costumes===
Costumes correspond to the theme of the play and indicate the character being portrayed. Costumes also indicate the status of the characters. Lower-status characters, such as females, wear less elaborate dresses, while those of higher rank have more decorative costumes.

Prominent performers () listed above, playing the six main characters (generally a combination of 2 Sang, 2 Daan, Zing, and Cau), are usually supposed to pay for their own costumes. Over time, these performers would reinvest their income into their wardrobe which would give an indication of their success. A performer&#x27;s wardrobe would be either sold or passed on to another performer upon retirement.

To career performers, sequin costumes are essential for festive performances at various &quot;Bamboo Theatres&quot; (). These costumes, passed from generation to generation of career performers, are priceless according to some art collectors. With time, the materials used for the costumes changed. From the 1950s to the 1960s, sequins were the most prevalent material used for designing the costumes. Nowadays, designers tends to use rhinestones or foil fabric (). Compared to sequins, rhinestones and foil fabric are lighter. However, many older generation performers continue to use sequins and they regard them as more eye-catching on stage.

Most of the costumes in Cantonese Opera come from traditional design. Since costume design is largely taught through apprenticeships, costume design remains largely constant. Some designers are taught the skill from family members, inheriting a particular style.

In 1973, Yam Kim Fai gave Loong Kim Sang, her protégée, the complete set of sequin costumes needed for career debut leading her own commercial performance at Chinese New Year Bamboo Theatre.

Some costumes from famous performers, such as Lam Kar Sing and Ng Kwun-Lai, are on loan or donation to the Hong Kong Heritage Museum.

===Hairstyle, hats, and helmets===
Hats and helmets signify social status, age and capability: scholars and officials wear black hats with wings on either side; generals wear helmets with pheasants&#x27; tail feathers; soldiers wear ordinary hats, and kings wear crowns. Queens or princesses have jeweled helmets. If a hat or helmet is removed, this indicates the character is exhausted, frustrated, or ready to surrender.

Hairstyles can express a character&#x27;s emotions: warriors express their sadness at losing a battle by swinging their ponytails. For the female roles, buns indicated a maiden, while a married woman has a &#x27;dai tau&#x27; ().

In the Three Kingdoms legends, Zhao Yun and especially Lü Bu are very frequently depicted wearing helmets with pheasants&#x27; tail feathers; this originates with Cantonese opera, not with the military costumes of their era, although it&#x27;s a convention that was in place by the Qing Dynasty or earlier.

==Aural elements==

===Speech types===
Commentators draw an essential distinction between sung and spoken text, although the boundary is a troublesome one. 
Speech-types are of a wide variety: one is nearly identical to standard conversational Cantonese, while another is a very smooth and refined delivery of a passage of poetry; some have one form or another of instrumental accompaniment while others have none; and some serve fairly specific functions, while others are more widely adaptable to variety of dramatic needs.

Cantonese opera uses Mandarin or Guān Huà (Cantonese: Gun1 Waa6/2) when actors are involved with government, monarchy, or military. It also obscures words that are taboo or profane from the audience. The actor may choose to speak any dialect of Mandarin, but the ancient Zhōngzhōu () variant is mainly used in Cantonese opera. Zhōngzhōu is located in the modern-day Henan province where it is considered the &quot;cradle of Chinese civilization&quot; and near the Yellow River. retains many of the initial sounds of many modern Mandarin dialects, but uses initials and codas from Middle Chinese. For example, the words and are both pronounced as /tsœːŋ˥˥/ () in Modern Cantonese, but will respectively be spoken as /tʂɑŋ˥˥/ () and /tɕiɑŋ˥˥/ () in operatic . Furthermore, the word is pronounced as /kɐm˥˥/ () in modern Cantonese and /tɕin˥˥/ () in standard Mandarin, but operatic Guān Huà will use /kim˥˥/ (). However, actors tend to use Cantonese sounds when speaking Mandarin. For instance, the command for &quot;to leave&quot; is and is articulated as /saː˨˨ tsʰɵy˧˧/ in operatic Guān Huà compared to /haː˨˨ hɵy˧˧ / () in modern Cantonese and /ɕi̯ɑ˥˩ tɕʰy˩/ () in standard Mandarin.

===Music===

Cantonese opera pieces are classified either as &quot;theatrical&quot; or &quot;singing stage&quot; (). The theatrical style of music is further classified into western music () and Chinese music (). While the &quot;singing stage&quot; style is always Western music, the theatrical style can be Chinese or western music. The &quot;four great male vocals&quot; () were all actresses and notable exponents of the &quot;singing stage&quot; style in the early 20th century.

The western music in Cantonese opera is accompanied by strings, woodwinds, brass plus electrified instruments. Lyrics are written to fit the play&#x27;s melodies, although one song can contain multiple melodies, performers being able to add their own elements. Whether a song is well performed depends on the performers&#x27; own emotional involvement and ability.

===Musical instruments===

Cantonese instrumental music was called &quot;ching yam&quot; before the People&#x27;s Republic was established in 1949. Cantonese instrumental tunes have been used in Cantonese opera, either as incidental instrumental music or as fixed tunes to which new texts were composed, since the 1930s.

The use of instruments in Cantonese opera is influenced by both western and eastern cultures. The reason for this is that Canton was one of the earliest places in China to establish trade relationships with the western civilizations. In addition, Hong Kong was under heavy western influence when it was a British colony. These factors contributed to the observed western elements in Cantonese opera.

For instance, the use of &quot;erhu&quot; (two string bowed fiddle), saxophones, guitars and the congas have demonstrated how diversified the musical instruments in Cantonese operas are.

The musical instruments are mainly divided into melodic and percussive types.

Traditional musical instruments used in Cantonese opera include wind, strings and percussion. The winds and strings encompass &quot;erhu&quot;, &quot;gaohu&quot;, &quot;yehu&quot;, &quot;yangqin&quot;, &quot;pipa&quot;, &quot;dizi&quot;, and &quot;houguan&quot;, while the percussion comprises many different drums and cymbals. The percussion controls the overall rhythm and pace of the music, while the &quot;gaohu&quot; leads the orchestra. A more martial style features the use of the &quot;suona&quot;.

The instrumental ensemble of Cantonese opera is composed of two sections: the melody section and the percussion section. The percussion section has its own vast body of musical materials, generally called &quot;lo gu dim&quot; () or simply &quot;lo gu&quot; (). These &#x27;percussion patterns&#x27; serve a variety of specific functions.

<text>Royal Air Force Odiham or more simply RAF Odiham is a Royal Air Force station situated a little to the south of the village of Odiham in Hampshire, England. It is the home of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s heavy lift helicopter, the Boeing Chinook, and of The King&#x27;s Helicopter Flight (TKHF). Its current station commander is Group Captain Matt Roberts.

==History==
Aircraft operations began from the site in 1925 but it was not until October 1937 that it was opened as a permanent airfield.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War North American Mustangs and Hawker Typhoons were flown out of the base. After the Allied invasion of Europe the site became a prisoner of war camp.
* No. 2 Squadron RAF operated the Mustang I between 7 August 1943 and 22 September 1943 and again between 6 October 1943 and 14 November 1943.
** The squadron returned on 27 June 1944 with the Mustang II before leaving on 29 July 1944.
* No. 4 Squadron RAF using the Hawker Hector and the Westland Lysander I between 16 February 1936 and 24 September 1939.
** The squadron returned on 7 August 1943 using the Mustang I until 15 September 1943 before returning again on 6 October 1943 and staying until 14 November 1943.
** 4 Squadron returned again with Supermarine Spitfire XI between 27 June 1944 and 16 August 1944 with a detachment at B 10/Plumelot.
* No. 13 Squadron RAF with the Westland Lysander Mk III and the Bristol Blenheim Mk IV between 17 July 1941 and 1 August 1942 with detachments at RAF Detling, RAF Wattisham and RAF Thruxton.
** The squadron returned on 10 August 1942 again with the Blenheim IV and for the first time the Mk V version. They left on 15 November 1942.
* No. 53 Squadron RAF with the Hawker Hector and the Blenheim IV between 8 April 1938 and 20 September 1939.
* No. 59 Squadron RAF operated the Blenheim IV between 6 June 1940 and 3 July 1940.
* No. 63 Squadron RAF using the Mustang Mk I between 21 November 1942 and 27 July 1943 with a detachment at RAF Macmerry.
* No. 82 Squadron RAF with the Blenheim IV between August 1939 and 21 March 1942 as an detachment from RAF Watton.
* No. 96 Squadron RAF operated the de Havilland Mosquito XIII between 24 September 1944 and 12 December 1944 before being disbanded here.

===Postwar===

==== Fighter role ====
Following the end of the War RAF Fighter Command assumed control of the base. No. 247 Squadron was re-equipped with Vampires in June 1946, while No. 54 Squadron and No. 72 Squadron were both re-equipped with Vampires in July 1946. No. 54 Squadron and No. 247 Squadron both converted to night fighter units equipped with Meteor F.8s in 1951. As part of her coronation celebrations the Queen reviewed the Royal Air Force at Odiham in 1953.

No. 46 Squadron was re-formed at RAF Odiham on 15 August 1954 as a night fighter unit equipped with Meteor NF12s and 14s. In 1955 No. 54 Squadron and No. 247 Squadron started receiving Hunters and, in 1956, No. 46 Squadron began converting to Javelins with the first arriving in February. Odiham closed as a fighter base in 1959.

==== Support helicopters ====
After a short period in &quot;care and maintenance&quot; status the base was reopened as part of Transport Command in 1960. In this role No. 72 Squadron was re-equipped with Bristol Belvedere helicopters in 1961 and then with Westland Whirlwind helicopters in 1964. The Westland helicopters were joined by the Aérospatiale Pumas of No. 33 Squadron and No. 230 Squadron in 1971.

The first Chinook HC.1s arrived at Odiham in 1981. These were replaced by the Chinook HC.2 in 1993. The RAF ordered the Chinook HC.3, a special forces variant, in 1995. After being in storage for eight years due to avionics certification problems, the HC.3 airframes were retro-fitted with HC.2 avionics during 2009 and 2010, to enable them to finally enter RAF service. The Mk6, which incorporates a new Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS), is a new buy of 14 aircraft which arrived in 2013.

No. 618 Volunteer Gliding Squadron arrived in July 2000. The Unit operated the Vigilant T Mk 1 self-launching glider, providing basic flying and gliding training to members of the Air Cadet Organisation. Due to a fleet-wide airworthiness issue, the Vigilant (and its cousin, the Viking conventional glider) were grounded in April 2014. No. 618 Volunteer Gliding Squadron was subsequently disbanded.

In May 2015, it was announced that the Chinook Operational Conversion Flight, comprising six Chinooks and 150 personnel would transfer from Odiham to RAF Benson to form a joint Puma and Chinook Operational Conversion Unit. The move began in December 2015 as the unit joined their Puma counterparts at Benson under a reformed No. 28 Squadron.

With the Lynx reaching the end of its operational life in January 2018, No. 657 Squadron of the Army Air Corps and their Lynx AH9A disbanded in May 2018.

To extend their life for at least 15 years, Odiham&#x27;s runways were upgraded in early 2021. The runway surfaces and lighting were replaced, with the airfield remaining open throughout the works.

==Role and operations==
RAF Odiham&#x27;s mission statement is to &quot;Deliver and sustain Chinook and Special Forces aviation operations world-wide, in order to support UK defence missions and tasks&quot;.&quot;

=== Support Helicopter Force (SHF) ===

To fulfil this mission, the station is home to No. 7 Squadron, No. 18 Squadron and No. 27 Squadron, all operating the Boeing Chinook and forming part of the RAF&#x27;s Support Helicopter Force. The Chinook is a heavy-lift helicopter used for tactical troop and load movements and casualty evacuation across the battlefield. The aircraft can carry up to fifty-five troops or around ten-tonnes of mixed cargo either internally or as an under-slung load.

The Chinook Display Team is also based at the Station.

=== Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing ===
Odiham is home to the headquarters of the Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing (JSFAW). The wing is a Royal Air Force and British Army organisation that coordinates the provision of rotary wing aviation support to the United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF). Providing this role are Chinooks of No. 7 Squadron at Odiham and Army Air Corps Eurocopter AS365N3 Dauphin II and Westland Gazelle AH1 aircraft based at Stirling Lines in Herefordshire.

=== Other activities ===
The Kestrel Gliding Club continues to fly from Odiham at weekends, having become part of the Royal Air Force Gliding and Soaring Association in 2006.

=== Station badge and motto ===
RAF Odiham&#x27;s badge, awarded in November 1951, features a port portcullis between two towers each displaying a red rose behind two silver arrows with red feathers, crossing one another. The arrows are entwined by a jess and surmounted by a bell. The portcullis and towers relate to Odiham Castle, a ruin dating from the 13th century, located approximately 2 km north of the station. The portcullis also originates from the badge of Fighter Command, under which the station operated during the 1950s. The roses reference the Hampshire coat of arms and the arrows represent the speed of the aircraft flown from the station. Representing a falconer and bird, jess and bell, refer to the control of hunting aircraft and refer to the role of squadrons at the station.

The station&#x27;s motto is &quot;&#x27;Promise and Fulfil&quot;&#x27;.

=== Gate Guardian ===
RAF Odiham&#x27;s gate guardian is a former US Army Boeing CH-47F Chinook. The airframe was donated by Boeing and reassembled at the station by Boeing and the RAF, using retired parts from several US and RAF Chinooks. It was unveiled in May 2012 by Secretary of State for Defence Philip Hammond during a visit to the station to celebrate 30 years of RAF Chinook operations.

<text>Royal Air Force Benson or RAF Benson is a Royal Air Force (RAF) station located at Benson, near Wallingford, in South Oxfordshire, England. It is a front-line station and home to the RAF&#x27;s fleet of Westland Puma HC2 support helicopters, used primarily for the transportation of troops &amp; equipment. Flying squadrons comprise No. 33 Squadron flying the Puma, No. 22 Squadron which provides operational evaluation and training for all aircraft in Joint Aviation Command and No. 28 Squadron, which is the combined Puma and Boeing Chinook HC6A training unit. Other units include the Oxford University Air Squadron and No. 6 Air Experience Flight, both flying the Grob Tutor T1 light training aircraft used for student and cadet flying training. The National Police Air Service and the Thames Valley Air Ambulance are also based at the station, both operating Airbus H135 helicopters.

RAF Benson opened in 1939 and during the Second World War it was tasked with training aircrews on the Fairey Battle light bomber and Avro Anson training aircraft. It was later home to squadrons flying the Supermarine Spitfire and de Havilland Mosquito which operated in the photographic reconnaissance role. Benson operated under RAF Transport Command throughout the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s, various communications and administrative units were present and in the early 1990s the station began its association with the support helicopter force.

==History==
=== Early years and the Second World War ===

Construction of RAF Benson began in 1937 as part of the 1930s RAF expansion programme which was largely a response to the threat of war with Nazi Germany. Construction was undertaken by contractors John Laing &amp; Son. Benson was officially opened as an RAF station under No. 6 Group in early 1939.

The station&#x27;s first tenants were two squadrons of Fairey Battle light bombers. No. 103 Squadron started flying in on 3 April 1939, to be joined over the next few months by No. 150 Squadron. Once the Second World War started, both squadrons moved to France as part of the Advanced Air Striking Force. 1939 also saw the establishment of No. 12 Operational Training Unit (No. 12 OTU), tasked with training pilots, observers and air gunners on the Fairey Battle and Avro Anson. In the early hours of 2 August 1940, a Battle took off from Benson for a cross-country training exercise but crashed into a nearby hill. The crew included Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth, founder of the Shuttleworth Collection, who was killed.

Benson&#x27;s long association with royalty began in September 1940, when the King&#x27;s Flight relocated to the station. This initial association was short-lived, as the flight was disbanded in 1942 to form the core of No. 161 Squadron at RAF Newmarket, to which responsibility for the transportation of royalty was transferred. The Battles and Ansons of No. 12 OTU were replaced in December 1940 with Vickers Wellington medium bombers.

Benson was selected in 1941 as the home station of No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (No. 1 PRU), an experimental unit tasked with evaluating and developing new methods of obtaining photographic intelligence over enemy territory, led by pioneer in the field Squadron Leader Sidney Cotton. Utilising Supermarine Spitfires, the unit found that their camouflage and operating altitude allowed them to remain virtually invisible to enemy defences and avoid interception. Additional fuel tanks on the Spitfires allowed missions to take place deep into enemy territory. Analysis of imagery was undertaken by the intelligence unit at nearby Ewelme Manor, a short distance from the station. The unit was the first to discover the Germany Navy battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, near Bergen in May 1941. Later that month the vessel was destroyed by the Allies in the North Atlantic. As a result of such work, the station gained considerable fame as the home of photographic reconnaissance for the remainder of the war.

New paved runways were built in 1942, one of which required the permanent closure of the Old London Road in Benson. As a result, the Royal Engineers built the present road (part of the A4074) between Benson and Crowmarsh.

In June 1943, No. 1 PRU was formed into No. 106 Wing, with five units (No. 540, No. 541, No. 542, No. 543 and No. 544 Squadrons). The wing was elevated to the status of No. 106 (Photo Reconnaissance) Group in April 1944, with two de Havilland Mosquito and two Spitfire squadrons (No. 543 Squadron having been disbanded when the aircraft strength per squadron was increased). The group was assigned to Coastal Command&#x27;s photo reconnaissance assets, with the whole of Northern Europe as its operational area. Spitfire and Mosquito aircraft flew missions over occupied Europe, including the provision of battle damage assessment images after Operation Chastise, the attack on German dams by No. 617 Squadron in May 1943.

By December 1944, Benson had two runways extending to which had been constructed using concrete and wood-chips. There was a selection of hangar types, including four C-type hangars, four over-size (O) blister hangars and fourteen extra-over-size (EO) blister hangars. Ten concrete hard-standings were available, and a total of 3,198 personnel were based at the station.

During the war Vera Lynn, known as &#x27;the forces Sweetheart&#x27;, visited Benson to entertain the troops, reportedly singing &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; at the station.

=== Post-war ===
Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of No. 542 Squadron and No. 544 Squadron in August and October 1945 respectively, with No. 540 and No. 541 Squadrons following in September 1946. The King&#x27;s Flight reformed at Benson in 1946 and received four Vickers Vikings during the following year. The unit was renamed the Queen&#x27;s Flight on the coronation of Elizabeth II in June 1953.

Benson retained a photographic reconnaissance role into the early 1950s. No. 58 Squadron reformed in October 1946 to fly the Mosquito and Anson, No.541 Squadron reformed in November 1947 with the Spitfire PR.19 and No. 540 Squadron reformed in December 1947 to fly the Mosquito. No. 541 Squadron received the Gloster Meteor in December 1950, before relocating to Germany in June 1951. No. 540 Squadron re-equipped with the English Electric Canberra PR.3 in late 1952 and relocated to RAF Wyton in 1953 along with No. 58 Squadron.

==== Transport Command ====

In 1953, Benson came under the control of Transport Command. No. 147 Squadron and No. 167 Squadron formed what was known as The Ferry Wing, which was responsible for the ferrying of aircraft across the globe. It was disbanded in 1960 when RAF squadrons became responsible for the collection and ferrying of their own aircraft.

Thereafter, Benson became the focus of the RAF&#x27;s medium-range tactical transport fleet, operating the Armstrong Whitworth Argosy C.1. The first of six aircraft arrived on 20 November 1961 to form the Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) which trained Argosy crews. The OCU later moved to RAF Thorney Island. In February 1962, No. 105 Squadron formed to establish the first front-line unit for the type. It was soon followed by No. 215 Squadron. By the end of 1963 both units had departed for the Middle East and Far East respectively. Two further Argosy units were established, No. 114 Squadron and No. 267 Squadron, both operating from Benson until the early 1970s.

==== Support role ====
With the departure of the Argosys, the only flying unit which remained at Benson was the Queen&#x27;s Flight. This remained the case throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Notwithstanding, the station remained busy with several administrative and support units taking up residence. These included the headquarters of No. 38 Group (part of RAF Support Command which relocated from RAF Odiham) and the Tactical Communications Wing (TCW), both of which arrived in 1972. They remained until 1976 when No. 38 Group was subsumed into RAF Strike Command and relocated to RAF Upavon, whereas the TCW moved to nearby RAF Brize Norton. They were replaced by the RAF Support Command Signals Headquarters (SCSHQ) and the Radio Introduction Unit, which arrived from RAF Medmenham during 1977. SCSHQ remained at Benson until 1981.

Flying activity increased in January 1983 when the Hawker Siddeley Andover arrived from RAF Brize Norton. Operated by No. 115 Squadron and supported by the Andover Training Flight, the Andover Serving Flight and the Support Command Flight Checking Unit, the Andovers were used in the radio and navigation-aid calibration role. The Support Command Flight Checking Unit disbanded in early 1987, with its role transferred to No. 115 Squadron.

The Queen&#x27;s Flight received its first BAe 146 in May 1986, with a second in July 1986 and a final aircraft in late 1990.

==== Support helicopters ====
Benson&#x27;s current support helicopter role began in 1992, when No. 60 Squadron reformed at the station, flying the Westland Wessex HC2.

In July of that year, the closure of nearby RAF Abingdon, resulted in several new units moving to Benson, namely the University of London Air Squadron and Oxford University Air Squadron both flying the Scottish Aviation Bulldog T.1 and No. 6 Air Experience Flight with the De Havilland Chipmunk T.1. The Mobile Catering Support Unit (MCSU), featuring a training facility and three Air Combat Support Units, returned in November 1992, having previously been stationed at Benson during the 1970s.

The headquarters of the Support Helicopter Force (SHFHQ) relocated to Benson from RAF Gütersloh in 1993, after the German station&#x27;s closure that year. The headquarters of No. 1 Group was located at Benson between 1993 and 1996.

On 1 April 1995, the Queen&#x27;s Flight, then equipped with the BAe 146 CC2 and Wessex HCC.4, merged with No. 32 Squadron and moved to RAF Northolt in London to become No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron, bringing Benson&#x27;s long association with VIP transport to an end.

June 1997 saw the Westland Puma HC1 introduced at Benson, when No. 33 Squadron arrived from RAF Odiham. The Puma Operational Conversion Flight, previously part of No. 27 Squadron at Odiham moved in during February 1998. Due to the increased level of helicopter activity at Benson, it was necessary to relocate the University of London Air Squadron to RAF Wyton during 1999.

In October 1999, as a result of the Strategic Defence Review, the RAF&#x27;s Support Helicopter Force was amalgamated into the newly formed tri-service Joint Helicopter Command, now called the Joint Aviation Command. The new command, reporting to the British Army&#x27;s Land Command, combined the battlefield support helicopters operated by the RAF, Fleet Air Arm and Army Air Corps.

=== 21st century ===
No. 28 Squadron reformed at Benson in July 2001 to equip with the new AgustaWestland Merlin HC3 support helicopter. To accommodate the new aircraft and personnel, a £25 million investment at Benson saw the refurbishment of the four C-type hangars, upgrading of station services &amp; infrastructure and construction of engineering facilities and 100 homes. By July 2003, approximately 1,400 military personnel, 166 Ministry of Defence civilians and 150 contractors were employed at Benson. A further Merlin unit, No. 78 Squadron, reformed in late 2007 to operate six Merlin HC3As which had been purchased from the Royal Danish Air Force.

Doubt was cast over the future of RAF Benson during a review of Joint Helicopter Command&#x27;s (JHC) airfields, known as Programme Belvedere. Consideration was given to closing at least one JHC airfield, with Benson&#x27;s support helicopters potentially relocating to RAF Lyneham. The programme was abandoned in May 2009, when it was decided to largely retain the existing JHC basing arrangements. However, in November of that year, the Puma force was brought together when No. 230 Squadron relocated from JHC Flying Station Aldergrove to Benson.

The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review recommended that to replace the Navy&#x27;s ageing Westland Sea King HC4, the RAF&#x27;s Merlin HC3/3A fleet should be transferred to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commando Helicopter Force. To gain experience of operating and maintaining the Merlin, Royal Navy aircrew and engineers were integrated into the Merlin force at Benson during 2012. The Merlin fleet was officially handed over to the navy during a ceremony at Benson on 30 September 2014. It was attended by Prince Andrew, Duke of York (Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm), and Prince Michael of Kent (Honorary Air Marshal of RAF Benson). Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford and Admiral Sir George Zambellas were also present. The ceremony marked the disbandment of No. 78 Squadron and its replacement by 846 Naval Air Squadron (NAS).

During July 2015, 845 Naval Air Squadron reformed and replaced No. 28 Squadron which disbanded. The last phases of the transition began when 846 NAS moved to RNAS Yeovilton on 26 March 2015. The final Merlin along with 845 NAS departed on 16 June 2016, bringing nearly 15 years of Merlin operations at Benson to a close.

In May 2015, it was announced that the Chinook Operational Conversion Flight, comprising six Boeing Chinooks and 150 personnel would transfer from RAF Odiham to Benson, to form a joint Puma and Chinook OCU, training crews on both aircraft types. The move began in December 2015 as the unit joined their Puma counterparts under a reformed No. 28 Squadron.

During 2016, the Joint Helicopter Support Squadron moved from RAF Odiham to Benson.

BAe 146 aircraft of No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron temporarily relocated to Benson between 15 April 2019 and late October 2019 due to the resurfacing of the runway at RAF Northolt. In May 2020, the Rotary Wing Operational Evaluation and Training Unit, which had been at Benson since 1997, adopted the No. 22 Squadron nameplate and took on the operational testing and evaluation role for the whole of Joint Helicopter Command.

== Infrastructure and facilities ==

The RAF Benson site extends to . It has one runway (01/19) which is long and is constructed from asphalt and concrete. A second runway (06/24) along with the western taxiways are no longer in use, The airfield features two areas known as load parks (north and south), which are used by helicopters for practising under-slung load operations.

Aircraft hangars at Benson date from the Second World War and comprise four C-type (known as hangars A to D) and a T2 hangar.

=== Medium Support Helicopter Aircrew Training Facility ===
The Medium Support Helicopter Aircrew Training Facility (MSHATF) is home to six helicopter flight simulators (three Chinook, two Merlin and a Puma version). The facility was established in October 1997 and is operated by CAE Aircrew Training Services through a Private Finance Initiative contract. It employs around 70 personnel and trains RAF, Royal Navy, British Army, NATO and foreign crews. As well as the simulators, there are also four computer-based ground school training classrooms and a tactical control centre, allowing for operational mission training. In October 2017, the MOD announced it would invest £90 million in the facility over eight years.

==Role and operations==
=== Command ===
Group Captain Chris Royston-Airey was appointed as Benson station commander in November 2022. Prince Michael of Kent was appointed Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Benson in 2002 and was promoted to Honorary Air Marshal of the RAF in 2012. The Support Helicopter Force is under the direction of Joint Helicopter Command, whereas other elements on the station are under the RAF&#x27;s No. 2 Group (Air Combat Support).

=== Support Helicopter Force (SHF) ===
The station is home to No. 33 Squadron and No. 230 Squadron, both operating the Westland Puma HC2, and forming part of the RAF&#x27;s Support Helicopter Force. The Puma is a medium-lift helicopter used for tactical troop and load movements across the battlefield. The aircraft can carry up to sixteen passengers or twelve fully equipped troops, or up to two tonnes of freight carried either internally or as an under-slung load.

No. 28 Squadron is the combined Puma and Boeing Chinook HC6A OCU. It receives crews from No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Shawbury and builds on their existing skills learnt from basic and advanced helicopter training to qualify them on the Puma and Chinook. Flying operations are supported by units such as No. 22 Squadron (the Operational Evaluation Unit for Joint Aviation Command) and Medium Support Helicopter Aircrew Training Facility which operates a variety of simulators.

No. 606 (Chiltern) Squadron (RAuxAF) is a reserve unit that provides personnel in ground-support roles to assist the Support Helicopter Force.

=== Station badge and motto ===
RAF Benson&#x27;s badge, awarded in August 1955, features a red rampant lion against the backdrop of an escallop. The lion relates to the Manor of Benson, having been granted in the 13th century to the Earl of Cornwall in whose Armorial Bearings a lion appears. The escallop, which is symbolic of early pilgrims, refers to the mobility function of this station.

The station&#x27;s motto () is in Latin and translates as &quot;Let us be known by our actions&quot;.

=== Gate guardian ===
Since 2012, Benson&#x27;s gate guardian has been a full-scale replica of a wartime Supermarine Spitfire PR.Mk XI. It carries the markings of Flight Lieutenant Duncan McCuaig who died while conducting a photographic reconnaissance mission over Bremen in Germany as part of Operation Crossbow&quot;.&quot; This aircraft replaced a genuine Spitfire PR.Mk XIX that was being restored to flying status.

=== Built heritage ===
The station is home to two K8 telephone kiosks which are grade II listed. They are described by Historic England as &quot;intact examples of the K8 model kiosk, an inventive modernist adaptation of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott&#x27;s classic K6 design&quot;.

<doc id="475025" wikidata="Q928354" url="?curid=475025" title="Liar! (short story)">
<text>&quot;Liar!&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It first appeared in the May 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and was reprinted in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982). It was Asimov&#x27;s third published positronic robot story. Although the word &quot;robot&quot; was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his 1920 play &quot;R.U.R.&quot; (Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots), Asimov&#x27;s story &quot;Liar!&quot; contains the first recorded use of the word &quot;robotics&quot; according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. The events of this short story are also mentioned in the novel &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; written by the same author.

==Plot summary==
Through a fault in manufacturing, a robot, RB-34 (also known as Herbie), is created that possesses telepathic abilities. While the roboticists at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men investigate how this occurred, the robot tells them what other people are thinking. But the First Law still applies to this robot, and so it deliberately lies when necessary to avoid hurting their feelings and to make people happy, especially in terms of romance.

However, by lying, it is hurting them anyway. When it is confronted with this fact by Susan Calvin (to whom it falsely claimed her coworker was infatuated with her – a particularly painful lie), the robot experiences an insoluble logical conflict and becomes catatonic.

==Adaptations==

* In 1958, &quot;Liar&quot; was adapted into an episode of the radio show &quot;Exploring Tomorrow&quot;. 
* &quot;El robot embustero&quot; (1966), short film directed by Antonio Lara de Gavilán
* In 1969, &quot;Liar&quot; was adapted into an episode of the British television series &quot;Out of the Unknown,&quot; although only a few short clips of this episode are known to exist. 
* The story was adapted in 1987 as part of episode 12 of the Soviet anthology series &quot;This Fantastic World&quot; (&quot;Этот фантастический мир&quot;). It featured Boris Plotnikov as RB-34 and Natalya Nazarova as Susan Calvin.
* The story was broadcast as episode four of a five-part &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; radio adaptation of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in February 2017.

==Accolades==
&quot;Liar&quot; was voted 41st in the 2012 Locus Poll of Best 20th Century Short Stories.

<doc id="475027" wikidata="Q16148831" url="?curid=475027" title="Estate agent">
<text>An estate agent is a person or business in the United Kingdom that arranges the selling, renting, or managing of properties and other buildings. An agent that specialises in renting is often called a letting or management agent. Estate agents are mainly engaged in the marketing of property available for sale and contract reassignments, and a solicitor or licensed conveyancer is used to prepare the legal documents. In Scotland, however, many solicitors also act as estate agents, a practice that is rare in England and Wales. In the other countries such as the United States, estate agents are more commonly called real estate agents.

&quot;Estate agent&quot; also remains the current title for the person responsible for the management of one group of privately owned, all or mostly tenanted properties under one ownership. Alternative titles are factor, steward, or bailiff, depending on the era, region, and extent of the property concerned.

==Origin==
The term originally referred to a person responsible for managing a landed estate, while those engaged in the buying and selling of homes were &quot;House Agents&quot;, and those selling land were &quot;Land Agents&quot;. However, in the 20th century, &quot;Estate Agent&quot; started to be used as a generic term. An estate agent is roughly synonymous with the United States term real estate broker.

Estate agents need to be familiar with their local area, including factors that could increase or decrease property prices. e.g. if a new road or airport is to be built this can blight houses nearby. Equally, the closing of a quarry or improvement of an area can enhance prices. In advising clients on an asking price, the agent must be aware of recent sale prices (or rental values) for comparable properties.

==Regulation==

In the United Kingdom, residential estate agents are regulated by the Estate Agents Act 1979 as well as the Consumers, Estate Agents, and Redress Act 2007.

In September 2012 CPRs (consumer protection regulation) was introduced which now regulates the residential sales process.

For residential property, there are also a few trade associations for estate agents, INEA The Independent Network of Estate Agents and NAEA Propertymark (formerly known as the National Association of Estate Agents). NAEA Propertymark members can be disciplined for breaches of their code of conduct. Their disciplinary process includes everything from cautions and warnings right through to more severe penalties of up to £5,000 for each rule breached, and a maximum penalty of €5 million for breaches of the specific anti money-laundering rules.

Some estate agents are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the principal body for UK property professionals, dealing with both residential, commercial, and agricultural property. Members, known as &quot;Chartered Surveyors&quot;, are elected based on examination and are required to adhere to a code of conduct, which includes regulations about looking after their clients&#x27; money and professional indemnity insurance in case of error or negligence.

The &quot;Ombudsman for Estate Agents Scheme&quot;, which obtained OFT approval for the &quot;Code of Practice for Residential Sales&quot; in 2006 and as of December 2018, claims to have over 15,897 sales offices and 14,746 letting offices registered with TPO.

There is a legal requirement to belong to either organisation to trade as an estate agent. Agents can be fined if they are not a member of a redress scheme. The redress scheme was brought in alongside and to govern agents in reference to the HIP (Home Information Pack).

==Industry structure in the UK==
A handful of national residential estate agents chains exist, with the majority being locally or regionally specialised companies.

Several multi-national commercial agencies exist, typically Anglo-American, pan-European, or global. These firms all seek to provide the full range of property advisory services, not just agency.

Only a handful of large firms trade in both commercial and residential property.

==Fees==
Estate agents&#x27; fees are charged to the seller of the property. Estate agents normally charge the seller, on a &#x27;no sale, no fee&#x27; basis, so that if the property doesn&#x27;t sell, then the customer will not pay anything to the estate agent and the agent will have worked for the customer, free of charge. If the seller does sell the property and complete the sale of their property to a buyer that was introduced by the estate agent, then the estate agent will charge anything from 1% to 3.5%, with the average in 2018 being reported as 1.42% including VAT and this is calculated based on the sale price of the property.

Alternative estate agency models, most notably online estate agents, generally offer a choice of fees, most of which are either paid on an up front basis, or paid later on completion. Fees range from around £300 to £800. 

===Lettings===
Estate agents who handle lettings of commercial property normally charge a fee of 7 to 15% of the first year&#x27;s rent, plus the whole of the first month&#x27;s rent. If two agents are charging 10%, they will split the fee between them. Estate agents selling commercial property (known as investment agents) typically charge 1% of the sale price.

The fees charged by residential letting agents vary, depending on whether the agent manages the property or simply procures new tenants. Charges to prospective tenants can vary from zero to £300 in non-refundable fees usually described as &quot;application&quot;, &quot;administration&quot; or &quot;processing&quot; fees (or all three). There are no guidelines for letting agents on charges, except that they are forbidden by law to charge a fee for a list of properties. All charges to tenants are illegal in Scotland. Otherwise, they are free to charge as they please in England and Wales.

The first month&#x27;s rent in advance plus a refundable bond (usually equal to one month&#x27;s rent) is also generally required. Most residential lettings in the UK are governed by assured shorthold tenancy contracts. Assured shorthold tenancies (generally referred to simply as &quot;shorthold&quot;) give less statutory protection than earlier, mostly obsolete, types of residential lettings. Shorthold tenancy agreements are standard contracts; the wording is generally available from legal stationers and on the internet for around £1.00, although most lettings agents will charge £30 to provide one.

It is important that tenant referencing checks are in place prior to a tenant moving into a property. The credit check can be run using credit history data from Equifax, Experian or Call Credit (the three main UK providers) using an in-house website system or a managed referencing service. A reputable agent will also ask for an employment reference and a previous landlord reference to attempt to verify that the tenant can afford the rental on the property and that there were no serious problems with the previous agent. It is also essential that proof of identity and proof of residency are also collected and filed.

===Selling===
Estate agents selling residential property generally charge between 0.5% (sole agency) and 3% (multiple agency) of the achieved sale price plus VAT (Value Added Tax). Some agents may charge for additional marketing such as newspapers and websites; however, generally, the advertising is included in the fee. All fees must be clearly agreed upon and noted in the agency agreement before market so there is no confusion of additional charges.

In July 2016, &quot;Which?&quot; found the national average estate agents fees to be 1.3%, although fees vary widely.

Other than for the cheapest properties, estate agent fees are generally the second most expensive component of the cost of moving house in the United Kingdom after stamp duty.

High Street agents rarely charge upfront costs for selling, nor costs for aborting a sale and withdrawing a home from the market. So whilst other options are available to sell property with online agents they do often charge upfront fees with no guarantee of selling or perhaps the motivation a no-sale no-fee High Street agency will offer.

===Other approaches===
Since around 2005, &quot;online estate agents&quot; have provided an alternative to the traditional fee structure, claiming cheaper, fixed fee selling packages. These online estate agents claim to give private property sellers the ability to market their property via the major property portals (the preferred medium used by traditional high street estate agents) for a fraction of the cost of the traditional estate agency. Online estate agents claim that they can advertise a property as effectively as traditional estate agents by using digital marketing techniques and centralising their back office operation to one location, rather than having physical offices in the town in which they are based. Online estate agents normally cover the whole of the UK, therefore claiming to be able to reduce fees due to removing geographical boundaries that traditional estate agents generally have. Lastly, online estate agents often charge up front, instead of a traditional agent, who would normally charge nothing if the property is not sold

In February 2010 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) announced that a change in the legislation for estate agents has led to a shake up in the way homes are sold, allowing cheaper online agents to become more established than they could before.

Intermediary estate agents and or property portals that are based in the United Kingdom have started to encourage UK and worldwide estate agents to collaborate by showing all their properties, thus allowing site visitors to see a vast array of UK and overseas properties all on one website.

Research undertaken in 2007 said that the most effective way of selling property is via &#x27;For Sale&#x27; signs, 28% of customers had seen the estate agent&#x27;s &quot;For Sale&quot; signs before researching more in depth into the properties. Searching for houses via the internet came in a close second (21%), with newspapers third at (17%). The fourth most effective way, and the most traditional, was customers visiting an estate agent&#x27;s office (15%). In 2010 80% to 90% of properties were found via the internet and agents see fewer people walking into their offices. Boards are still very effective, but many agents are now cutting out paper advertising and moving just to digital such as eMags and just the web.

Other methods included auctions (11%), word of mouth (3%) and leaflets (2%).

==Technology==
Estate agents use estate agency software to manage their buying applicants, property viewings, marketing and property sales. Estate agents can use the software to prepare property particulars which are used to advertise the property either online or in print. They can also record the requirements of a buying applicant and automatically match them against their database of properties. Once a sale is agreed upon, they can manage the chain of linked property sales using the software.

Estate agency software will also help with property marketing by automatically distributing the property details to property portals.

The latest technology has influenced the growth of Online Agents, and the property sector becoming more reliant on the use of technology to appeal to the consumer market. An example of a company conducting this currently is Matterport, who have created a camera that creates digital 3D models and VR floorpans and ultra HD photography. This has led to digital marketers being able to influence online behaviour in the property market through the use of a Web Portal. By using secure websites, marketers then have the ability to monitor the level of user activity and gain invaluable information to help sellers and estate agents to utilise their marketing and better appeal to the needs of their customers.

In recent years agents have started working together again through systems similar to the USA called MLS (multi listing service). This is where a main agent will take on a property and send details via the most to other local (sub) agents. The sub agents will market and introduce applicants to the main agent. MLS can achieve more offers, sell a property quicker, and is offered by agents as a premium service.

In the US property data is passed from the agents software by the RETS data feed schema. In the UK the INEA idx (information data exchange) data feed is being adopted by many software to receive sub (mls) property listings back.

In both cases technology via MLS and idx means that sub agents collaborating can populate many more properties into their websites by working together.

==Working as an estate agent==
In Britain, no formal qualifications are required to become an estate agent; however, local property knowledge and customer-service skills are considered worthwhile.

==Estate agent speak==
A humorous guide to estate agent language was published by the BBC in 2002.

<text>George Blake ( Behar; 11 November 1922 – 26 December 2020) was a spy with Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and worked as a double agent for the Soviet Union. He became a communist and decided to work for the MGB while a prisoner during the Korean War. Discovered in 1961 and sentenced to 42 years in prison, he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London in 1966 and fled to the Soviet Union where he resided until dissolution in 1991. He continued to reside in the Russian Federation until his death in 2020. He was not one of the Cambridge Five spies, although he associated with Donald Maclean and Kim Philby after reaching the Soviet Union.

==Early life==

George Blake was born George Behar in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in 1922. He was the son of a Protestant Dutch mother, Catherine (née Beijderwellen), and an Egyptian father of Sephardi Jewish origin who was a naturalised British subject. He was named George after George V of the United Kingdom. His father, Albert Behar, served in the British Army during the First World War. While Albert received the Meritorious Service Medal, he embellished his war service when recounting it to his wife and children, and concealed his Jewish background until his death. The Behars lived a comfortable existence in the Netherlands until Albert&#x27;s death in 1936. The thirteen-year-old Behar was sent to live with a wealthy aunt in Egypt, where he continued his education at the English School in Cairo. He later attended Downing College, Cambridge, to study Russian.

While in Cairo, he was close to his cousin Henri Curiel, who was later to become a leader of the Communist Democratic Movement for National Liberation in Egypt. In 1991, Blake said that his encounter with Curiel, who was a decade older and already a Marxist, shaped his views in later life.

When the Second World War broke out, Behar was back in the Netherlands. In 1940, Germany invaded and quickly defeated the Dutch military. Behar was interned but released because he was only 17, and joined the Dutch resistance as a courier. In 1942, he escaped from the Netherlands and travelled to Britain via Spain and Gibraltar, reaching London in January 1943. There, he was reunited with his mother and his sisters, who had fled at the start of the war. In 1943, his mother decided to change the family name from Behar to Blake.

==Espionage activities==
After he reached Britain, Blake joined the Royal Navy as a sub-lieutenant before being recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) in 1944. For the rest of the war, Blake was employed in the Dutch Section. He intended to marry an MI6 secretary, Iris Peake, but her family prevented the marriage because of Blake&#x27;s Jewish background and the relationship ended. 

In 1946, he was posted to Hamburg and put in charge of the interrogation of German U-boat captains. In 1947, the Navy sent Blake to study languages, including Russian, at Downing College, Cambridge, where his fellow students included the future foreign policy analyst Michael MccGwire. 

He was posted thereafter to the British legation in Seoul, South Korea, under Vyvyan Holt, arriving on 6 November 1948. Under cover as a vice-consul, Blake&#x27;s mission was to gather intelligence on Communist North Korea, Communist China, and the Soviet Far East.

The Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, and Seoul was quickly captured by the advancing Korean People&#x27;s Army of the North. After British forces joined the United Nations Command defending the South, Blake and the other British diplomats were taken prisoner. As the tide of the war turned, Blake and the others were taken north, first to Pyongyang and then to the Yalu River. After seeing the bombing of North Korea, and after reading the works of Karl Marx and others during his three-year detention, he became a communist.

At a secret meeting arranged with his guards, he volunteered to work for the Soviet Union&#x27;s spy service, the MGB. In an interview, Blake was once asked: &quot;Is there one incident that triggered your decision to effectively change sides?&quot; Blake responded:
It was the relentless bombing of small Korean villages by enormous American Flying Fortresses. Women and children and old people, because the young men were in the army. We might have been victims ourselves. It made me feel ashamed of belonging to these overpowering, technically superior countries fighting against what seemed to me defenceless people. I felt I was on the wrong side ... that it would be better for humanity if the Communist system prevailed, that it would put an end to war.

However, in his first interview, in 1990, with Tom Bower for &#x27;The Confession&#x27;, a BBC TV documentary, Blake said that he had been tempted towards communism during his Russian course in Cambridge while serving with MI6, and had been finally convinced while reading Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; during his imprisonment in North Korea.
Following his release in 1953, Blake returned to Britain as a hero, landing at RAF Abingdon. In October 1954, he married MI6 secretary Gillian Allan in St Mark&#x27;s Church (North Audley Street) in London. In 1955, he was sent by MI6 to work as a case officer in Berlin, where his task was to recruit Soviet officers as double agents. But he also informed his KGB contacts of the details of British and American operations, including Operation Gold in which a tunnel into East Berlin was used to tap telephone lines used by the Soviet military, and the similar Operation Silver (1949) by the British in Vienna. He was called &quot;Agent Diomid&quot;. In order to protect Blake from exposure, the Soviet decided not to &quot;discover&quot; the tunnel until it had been in operation for nearly a year. According to the author of a 2019 book about the operation, the Soviets &quot;value[d] Blake so much, they fear[ed] his exposure more than they fear[ed] a breach of their secrets&quot;.

In the course of nine years, Blake is said to have betrayed details of some forty MI6 agents to the KGB, destroying most of MI6&#x27;s operations in Eastern Europe, although this remains unsubstantiated. Blake later said of this: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I handed over because it was so much.&quot; In the same TV interview, Blake claimed to have betrayed 500 British agents. In 1959 Blake became aware of a Central Intelligence Agency mole inside GRU, and was possibly instrumental in exposing P. S. Popov, who was executed in 1960.

Although Blake&#x27;s espionage during the Cold War is famous and has regularly been pored over, it has been in a less detailed way than the Cambridge Five spy ring, because &quot;Blake was never part of this [elite] class-ridden inner circle&quot;, according to an article by &quot;The Guardian&quot;
after Blake&#x27;s death. &quot;Born in Rotterdam to a Dutch mother and an Egyptian Jewish father [he] was never considered one of them.&quot;

==Discovery and conviction==
In 1961, Blake fell under suspicion after revelations by Polish defector Michael Goleniewski and others. He was arrested when he arrived in London after being summoned from Lebanon, where he had been enrolled at the Middle East Centre for Arabic Studies (MECAS). Three days into his interrogation, Blake denied he was tortured or blackmailed by the North Koreans. Without thinking about what he was saying, he stated that he had switched sides voluntarily. He then gave his MI6 interrogators a full confession.

The maximum sentence for any one offence under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 is 14 years, but his activities were divided into five time periods charged as five offences and, in May 1961 after an &quot;in camera&quot; trial at the Old Bailey, he was sentenced to the maximum term of 14 years consecutively on each of three counts of spying for a potential enemy and 14 years concurrently on both the two remaining counts—a total of 42 years imprisonment—by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Parker of Waddington. This sentence was reported by newspapers to represent one year for each of the agents who were killed when he betrayed them, although this is dubious. It was the longest non-life sentence ever handed down by a British court.

==Escape from prison==

Five years into his imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, Blake escaped with the help of three men he had met in prison, Sean Bourke and two anti-nuclear campaigners, Michael Randle and Pat Pottle. The escape was masterminded by Bourke, who first approached Randle only for financial help with the escape. Randle became more involved and suggested they bring Pottle in on the plan as well, as he had suggested springing Blake to Randle in 1962 when they were both still in prison. Their motives for helping Blake to escape were their belief that the 42-year sentence was &quot;inhuman&quot; and because of a personal liking of Blake. Several sources also state that the plan was financed by film director Tony Richardson.

Bourke had smuggled a walkie-talkie to Blake to communicate with him while in prison. On 22 October 1966, Blake broke a window at the end of the corridor where his cell was located. Then between 6 and 7 p.m., while most of the other inmates and guards were at the weekly film showing, Blake climbed through the window, slid down a porch and made his way to the perimeter wall. There, Bourke, who had been released from the prison earlier, threw a rope ladder over the wall. Blake then used it to climb over the wall and they drove off to a safe house. During the escape, Blake fractured his wrist jumping from the perimeter wall, but apart from that it all went according to plan.

After the escape, it became apparent that the safe house was not suitable, as it was a bedsit that was cleaned by the landlady once a week. Blake then spent several days moving between Randle and Pottle&#x27;s friends&#x27; houses, including that of Rev. John Papworth in Earls Court. Subsequently, Blake and Bourke moved in with Pottle, staying with him while preparing to get out of the country. They smuggled Blake across the English Channel in a camper van, then drove across northern Europe and through West Germany to the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing. Having safely crossed the border without incident, Blake met his handlers in East Germany and completed his escape to the Soviet Union.

Pottle and Randle were not prosecuted until 1991. Their defence was a claim of moral justification for aiding Blake, whose 42-year sentence they considered to be excessively long and &quot;inhuman&quot;. Despite being directed that they must find the men guilty, the jury acquitted them both, an act known as jury nullification in which a jury uses its absolute discretion to find as it sees fit. Bourke was not prosecuted for his role since Ireland refused to extradite him to the United Kingdom to face charges that were political in nature.

==Moscow==
In November 1966, his wife Gillian, with whom he had three children, began divorce proceedings against him, and in March 1967 Mr Justice Orr granted a &quot;decree nisi&quot; in Blake&#x27;s absence, on the grounds that the conviction of a spouse for treason can amount to cruelty or constructive desertion. Custody of their three sons was awarded to Gillian. This caused Blake a good deal of grief, though he knew that Gillian would have struggled to settle into life in the Soviet Union.

In 1990, Blake published the autobiography &quot;No Other Choice&quot;. The book&#x27;s British publisher had paid him approximately £60,000 before the government intervened to stop him profiting from sales. Eventually, the amount seized by the government totalled £90,000. He later filed a complaint charging the British government with a human rights violation for taking nine years to decide on his case and was awarded £5,000 in compensation by the European Court of Human Rights. In 1991, Blake testified by video recording when Randle and Pottle were put on trial for aiding his escape. They were acquitted. In an interview with NBC News in 1991, Blake said he regretted the deaths of the agents he had betrayed.

In a 1992 interview for the programme &quot;As It Happens&quot;, aired by Canada&#x27;s CBC Radio, Blake praised the general concept of communism. He said that he had offered his services to the Soviet Union because he viewed communism as &quot;a great experiment of mankind, to create a more just society, to create, in fact, the kingdom of God in this world&quot;. During this discussion, he denied responsibility for the deaths of any British agents, having been assured by the Soviets that none were executed based on the intelligence that he had provided, assurances he accepted. However, according to NPR, &quot;Blake gave up the identities of hundreds of British spies, some of whom were executed.&quot;

In the 1992 CNN series Cold War, former KGB general Oleg Kalugin remarked, &quot;George Blake had that innocent mind, in a sense. He&#x27;s still a very naïve man. He didn&#x27;t want to know that many people he betrayed were executed. And I think we discussed this subject at one point, and he wouldn&#x27;t believe it. He would say, &#x27;Well, I was told that this would not happen!&#x27; It did happen. He was not told.&quot;

Blake married again, in 1968, to Ida Mikhailovna Kareyeva with whom he had one child. He also reconciled with his other children. In late 2007, Blake was awarded the Order of Friendship on his 85th birthday by Vladimir Putin. Blake&#x27;s later book, &quot;Transparent Walls&quot; (2006), was reported by the daily &quot;Vzglyad&quot; (&quot;The View&quot;). Sergei Lebedev, the then director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation, wrote in the book&#x27;s foreword that despite the book&#x27;s being devoted to the past, it is about the present as well. He also wrote that Blake, the 85-year-old colonel of foreign intelligence, &quot;still takes an active role in the affairs of the secret service&quot;.

In 2012, Blake celebrated his 90th birthday, still living in Moscow on a KGB pension. His eyesight was failing and he described himself as &quot;virtually blind&quot;. He remained a committed Marxist–Leninist. Blake denied being a traitor, insisting that he had never felt British: &quot;To betray, you first have to belong. I never belonged.&quot;

Five years later, Blake remained committed to Russia and to communism. In a November 2017 statement, he claimed that its spies now have &quot;the difficult and critical mission&quot; of saving the world &quot;in a situation when the danger of nuclear war and the resulting self-destruction of humankind again have been put on the agenda by irresponsible politicians. It&#x27;s a true battle between good and evil.&quot;

== Death ==
Blake died on 26 December 2020, aged 98, in Moscow. The RIA Novosti news agency first reported Blake&#x27;s death, citing Russia&#x27;s SVR foreign intelligence agency. &quot;We received some bitter news—the legendary George Blake passed away,&quot; it said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself an ex-KGB agent, expressed his &quot;deep condolences&quot; to Blake&#x27;s family and friends. In a message published on the Kremlin website, the Russian leader noted Blake&#x27;s &quot;invaluable contribution to ensuring strategic parity and maintaining peace on the planet.&quot; Putin also said of Blake, &quot;Colonel Blake was a brilliant professional of special vitality and courage.&quot;

Blake was buried with military honours at Moscow&#x27;s Troyekurovskoye Cemetery, in its Alley of Heroes, under the name Georgy Ivanovich Bekhter, the name with which he lived from 1965. 

He is commemorated on a sculpture honouring intelligence officers outside the SVR&#x27;s headquarters in Moscow.

==In culture==
Desmond Bagley&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;The Freedom Trap&quot; and its screen version, John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Mackintosh Man&quot; from 1973, were loosely based on Blake&#x27;s prison escape.

For his novel &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; John le Carré used Blake&#x27;s foreign background (&quot;half a Dutchman and half a Jew&quot;) as partial inspiration for the characters of Toby Esterhase and Roy Bland. Le Carré later recalled &quot;when I started putting together my little bestiary of suspects, I made sure there were at least two of them...who were alienated by birth from the class structure that they served.&quot;

The play &quot;Cell Mates&quot; (1995) by Simon Gray is about Blake and Sean Bourke. The original production starred Stephen Fry as Blake and Rik Mayall as Bourke. The production was thrown into turmoil when Fry left the production following a bad review. Alfred Hitchcock planned to make a film, &quot;The Short Night&quot;, based on Blake, but died before doing so. 

In 2015, BBC &quot;Storyville&quot; made a documentary about Blake at the age of 92, which included interviews with Blake. The film was titled &quot;Storyville: Masterspy of Moscow – George Blake&quot;. In 2021 the BBC radio play &quot;Breaking Blake&quot; by Barnaby Kay was broadcast. It covers his escape from prison and his flight to a Czechoslovakian border post with East Germany in a camper van&#x27;s hidden compartment.

George Blake appears as a character in Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Innocent.&quot;

<doc id="475035" wikidata="Q1748985" url="?curid=475035" title="Pseudoscalar">
<text>In linear algebra, a pseudoscalar is a quantity that behaves like a scalar, except that it changes sign under a parity inversion while a true scalar does not.

A pseudoscalar, when multiplied by an ordinary vector, becomes a &quot;pseudovector&quot; (or &quot;axial vector&quot;); a similar construction creates the pseudotensor.
A pseudoscalar also results from any scalar product between a pseudovector and an ordinary vector. The prototypical example of a pseudoscalar is the scalar triple product, which can be written as the scalar product between one of the vectors in the triple product and the cross product between the two other vectors, where the latter is a pseudovector.

==In physics==
In physics, a pseudoscalar denotes a physical quantity analogous to a scalar. Both are physical quantities which assume a single value which is invariant under proper rotations. However, under the parity transformation, pseudoscalars flip their signs while scalars do not. As reflections through a plane are the combination of a rotation with the parity transformation, pseudoscalars also change signs under reflections.

===Motivation===
One of the most powerful ideas in physics is that physical laws do not change when one changes the coordinate system used to describe these laws. That a pseudoscalar reverses its sign when the coordinate axes are inverted suggests that it is not the best object to describe a physical quantity. In 3D-space, quantities described by a pseudovector are antisymmetric tensors of order 2, which are invariant under inversion. The pseudovector may be a simpler representation of that quantity, but suffers from the change of sign under inversion. Similarly, in 3D-space, the Hodge dual of a scalar is equal to a constant times the 3-dimensional Levi-Civita pseudotensor (or &quot;permutation&quot; pseudotensor); whereas the Hodge dual of a pseudoscalar is an antisymmetric (pure) tensor of order three. The Levi-Civita pseudotensor is a completely antisymmetric pseudotensor of order 3. Since the dual of the pseudoscalar is the product of two &quot;pseudo-quantities&quot;, the resulting tensor is a true tensor, and does not change sign upon an inversion of axes. The situation is similar to the situation for pseudovectors and antisymmetric tensors of order 2. The dual of a pseudovector is an antisymmetric tensor of order 2 (and vice versa). The tensor is an invariant physical quantity under a coordinate inversion, while the pseudovector is not invariant.

The situation can be extended to any dimension. Generally in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space the Hodge dual of an order &quot;r&quot; tensor will be an antisymmetric pseudotensor of order and vice versa. In particular, in the four-dimensional spacetime of special relativity, a pseudoscalar is the dual of a fourth-order tensor and is proportional to the four-dimensional Levi-Civita pseudotensor.

===Examples===
* The stream function formula_1 for a two-dimensional, incompressible fluid flow formula_2.
* Magnetic charge is a pseudoscalar as it is mathematically defined, regardless of whether it exists physically.
* Magnetic flux is the result of a dot product between a vector (the surface normal) and pseudovector (the magnetic field).
* Helicity is the projection (dot product) of a spin pseudovector onto the direction of momentum (a true vector).
* Pseudoscalar particles, i.e. particles with spin 0 and odd parity, that is, a particle with no intrinsic spin with wave function that changes sign under parity inversion. Examples are pseudoscalar mesons.

==In geometric algebra==
A pseudoscalar in a geometric algebra is a highest-grade element of the algebra. For example, in two dimensions there are two orthogonal basis vectors, formula_3, formula_4 and the associated highest-grade basis element is

:formula_5

So a pseudoscalar is a multiple of formula_6. The element formula_6 squares to −1 and commutes with all even elements – behaving therefore like the imaginary scalar formula_8 in the complex numbers. It is these scalar-like properties which give rise to its name.

In this setting, a pseudoscalar changes sign under a parity inversion, since if

:formula_9

is a change of basis representing an orthogonal transformation, then

:formula_10

where the sign depends on the determinant of the transformation. Pseudoscalars in geometric algebra thus correspond to the pseudoscalars in physics.

<text>Forensic psychology is the application of scientific knowledge and methods (in relation to psychology) to assist in answering legal questions that may arise in criminal, civil, contractual, or other judicial proceedings. Forensic psychology includes research on various psychology-law topics, such as: jury selection, reducing systemic racism in criminal law, eyewitness testimony, evaluating competency to stand trial, or assessing military veterans for service-connected disability compensation. The American Psychological Association&#x27;s &quot;Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists&quot; reference several psychology sub-disciplines, such as: social, clinical, experimental, counseling, and neuropsychology.

== History ==


As early as the 19th century, criminal profiling began to emerge, with the Jack the Ripper case being the first instance of criminal profiling, by forensic doctor and surgeon Thomas Bond. In the first decade of the 20th century, Hugo Münsterberg, the first director of Harvard&#x27;s psychological laboratory and a student of Wilhelm Wundt, one of the first experimental psychologists, authored &quot;On the Witness Stand&quot;. In the publication, Münsterberg attempted to demonstrate how psychological research could be applied in legal proceedings. Sigmund Freud also discussed how psychopathological processes play a role in criminal behavior. Other significant early figures in forensic psychology include Lightner Witmer, and William Healy.

In 1917, the lie detector was invented by the psychologist William Marston. Six years after its invention, Marston brought his lie detector to court in the case of Frye v. United States at the request of James A. Frye&#x27;s attorneys, who hoped Marston&#x27;s device would prove their client&#x27;s innocence. The results were not deemed admissible, due to lie detection not being widely accepted in the scientific community. This led to the creation of the Frye standard, which states scientific evidence is only admissible when it has prominent standing within the scientific community.

The 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, was the first where the Supreme Court of the United States referenced expert opinions by psychologists. After this, the preponderance of psychological mechanisms within courtrooms began to be considered beneficial. Several years after the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling, Justice David Bazelon of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that psychologists had the legal authority to testify as medical experts about mental illness.

In 1969, the American Psychology–Law Society was founded, later being converted into Division 41 of the APA in 1980. As the field continued to grow, more organizations supported the application of psychology to the law. In 1976, the American Board of Forensic Psychology was chartered, eventually becoming part of the American Board of Professional Psychology in 1985. Organizations and conferences later aided in solidifying the development of forensic psychology, such as the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the National Invitational Conference on Education and Training in Forensic Psychology. By 2001, forensic psychology was recognized as a professional specialty by the American Psychological Association.

In 1993, the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical introduced the standard of admissibility when an expert witness is on the stand. The case started after the parents of Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller, sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals after their children were born with serious birth defects due to a drug called Bendectin. After moving the case to federal court, then Merrell Dow moved for summary judgement when they submitted documents show that there was no published scientific study demonstrating any links between the drug Bendectin and birth defects. Then Daubert and Schuller submitted expert evidence as well, showing that Bendectin did cause birth defects, based on &quot;in vitro&quot; and i&quot;n vivo&quot; animal studies, pharmacological studies and reanalysis of other published studies. At the time of the case these methodologies of evidence were not considered to be acceptable. The summary judgement was granted to Merrell Dow, the parents appealed to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit had only granted summary judgment because the plaintiffs&#x27; proffered evidence that were accepted as a reliable technique by scientist. The reason it was granted to Merrell Dow was because at the time of the case the Frye standard was considered the correct standard of evidence. This Daubert standard eventually became the standard used by the U.S. Supreme Court. The standard is considered to be a part of the Federal Rules of Evidence, this also includes the admissibility of evidence as well. The Supreme Court reversed, and remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Through the remand, the court was able to analyze the evidence presented under the new standard and decided to uphold the district court&#x27;s original grant of summary judgement for the defendant. Because of this case ruling the Daubert standard was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, the old Frye standard while being used more by most states, has been slowly overturned and no longer referencing to it.

Modern forensic psychological research applies psychological methodology to legal contexts. In the 1980s, Saul Kassin, a psychology professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, published a series of papers on false confessions. One of Kassin&#x27;s articles was instrumental in overturning the convictions of five boys who had been falsely convicted of the rape of a jogger. At the University of Liverpool, David V. Canter is credited with the creation of the term investigative psychology, a sub-specialization of forensic psychology that pertains to of criminal behavior and the investigative process. Through the psychological profiling of the Railway Rapists, Canter assisted in the capture of the killers. The 20th-century psychologist William Stern, conducted numerous experiments on eyewitness testimony, credibility, consistency, and the influence of leading questions in court.

Recently, forensic psychology has grown in popularity in the media. For example, many recent docuseries on Netflix feature forensic psychological content, including Making a Murderer and Sins of our Mother. Other TV shows and movies such as Criminal Minds, Manhunter, Mindhunter, and Silence of The Lambs have widely popularized the practice of criminal profiling, particularly within the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s (FBI) Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). One example of a highly publicised case that used forensic psychology was Ted Bundy&#x27;s sentencing. In 1980, he went to trial and was evaluated by multiple psychology professionals to determine his ability to stand before the court. The results from the multiple psychologist evaluations determined that Ted Bundy was fit to stand before the court.

== Training and education ==
Forensic psychology involves both elements of basic as well as applied work. Forensic psychologists may hold a PhD or Psy.D. in clinical psychology, counseling psychology, social psychology, organizational psychology, school psychology, or experimental psychology under accredited institutions. Additionally, two years of supervised experience in their field is necessary. There are no specific license requirements in the United States to be a forensic psychologist, although U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia require licensure for psychologists in the state they intend to practice. Certification specifically in forensic psychology is also available.

There are 67 forensic psychology degree programs offered in the US. Average tuition cost for an undergraduate is $7,687 in-state and $26,401 out-of-state. For a graduate, the average tuition cost is $11,167 in-state and $20,272 out-of-state.

There is a wide range of pay for individuals in the forensic psychology field. In the United States, the median annual income of clinical-forensic psychologists is $125,000 - $149,999, and the pay can range from $50,000 (entry-level) a year to more than $350,000 a year.

As of 2023, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, has seen a 7% rise in psychologist employment, which is faster than average, and there has been 207,500 new jobs for psychologists.

== Practice and research in forensic psychology ==
Forensic psychology may be utilized in five major areas (police and public safety, law, crime and delinquency, victimology and victim services, and corrections) and two sub-areas (family and schools).

=== Practice/direct service ===
Forensic psychologists complete evaluations and assessments to assess a person&#x27;s psychological state for legal purposes&quot;.&quot; Reasons for completing these evaluations can involve acquiring information for criminal court (such as insanity or incompetence), for criminal sentencing or parole hearings (often regarding a potential intellectual disability that prevents sentencing or one&#x27;s risk of recidivism), for family court (including child custody or parental termination cases), or civil court (involving, for example, personal injury, competence to manage one&#x27;s financial affairs, and psychological autopsies especially as related to testamentary capacity). Additional assessments that these professionals can perform include school threats. Forensic psychologists also usually have to participate in court as a witness and assist judges, attorneys, or other court personnel in legal matters. This gives them the opportunity to help out as much as they can. There is great debate about whether these Forensic Psychological evaluations constitute as health care treatment, with most arguments claiming they do not. A forensic psychologist is responsible for assessing and reporting results of an evaluation, but does not make decisions on &quot;ultimate issues&quot;, such as competence to stand trial or service-connected disability for U.S. military veterans. Instead, the information provided by the expert evaluator is analyzed and is ruled on by the court which ordered the evaluation to take place.

==== Treatment ====
Forensic psychologists may be asked to administer psychological interventions to those requiring or requesting services in both criminal and civil cases. Regarding criminal cases, forensic psychologists can work with individuals who have already been sentenced to reduce the likelihood of repeating their offense. Other treatments are frequently put together in these case, especially for substance use disorder, sex offenders, mental illness, or anger management. As for civil proceedings, forensic psychology treats families going through divorce cases, custody cases, and psychological injuries due to trauma. Treatment often occurs in forensic and state psychiatric hospitals, mental health centers, and private practices.

==== Consultations ====
Providing consultations allows forensic psychologists to apply psychological expertise and research to help law enforcement, attorneys, and other legal professionals or proceedings better understand human behavior (e.g. criminal, witness, victim, jury), civil processes, effects of trauma or other life events, and so on. If working as a consultant, a forensic psychologist can be involved in legal proceedings through responsibilities such as reviewing court records (such as a defendant&#x27;s psychosocial history or assessing mitigating or aggravating factors in a case), serving as a jury consultant (organizing focus groups, shadow juries, mock juries, or helping with the voir dire proceedings), and assessment without testimony (in which results of a defendant&#x27;s evaluation are not disclosed to the prosecution team, allowing the defense team to develop a defense strategy), among others. Essentially, consultations can take many forms, including the common ones below:

# Law enforcement consultations may take the form of assisting with criminal profiling, developing hiring procedures and methods, determining the psychological fitness of returning officers, or simply lending expertise on certain criminal behaviors. There are several methods and approaches related to criminal profiling, but there is a lot of skepticism and criticism about the efficiency and accuracy of criminal profiling in general. A couple common approaches are the scientific approach, which includes the FBI&#x27;s Crime Scene Analysis and Canter&#x27;s Investigative Psychology, and the intuitive approach, which includes Tukey&#x27;s Behavioral Evidence Analysis.
# Trial consultants are psychologists who work with legal professionals, such as attorneys, to aid in case preparation. This includes jury selection, development of case strategy, and witness preparation. Forensic psychologists working as trial consultants rely on research to best advise the individuals they are working with. Because trial consultants are often hired by one specific side in a trial, these psychologists face many ethical issues. It is the psychologist&#x27;s responsibility to remain neutral when consulting. In other words, the consultant must not choose a side to support and consequentially omit or create information that would be beneficial to one side or another. Before accepting a case to work on, the forensic psychologist weighs the responsibilities of consulting on that case with the ethical guidelines put in place for the field of forensic psychology.

Expert testimony about matters relating to psychology is also an area in which forensic psychologists play an active role. Unlike fact witnesses, who are limited to testifying about what they know or have observed, expert witnesses can express further knowledge of a situation or topic because, as their name suggests, they are presumed to be &quot;experts&quot; in a certain topic and possess specialized knowledge about it. The requirements that must be met for forensic psychologists to be considered expert witnesses include clinical psychology expertise and knowledge of the laws that have jurisdiction over the court they are to testify. Procedural and legal rules guide expert testimony, including that the evidence must be relevant to the case, the method the expert used must be valid and reliable, and that the evidence will help the trier of fact. An expert can be deposed by opposing counsel to discover what they plan to say in court. Attorneys have the opportunity to raise a challenge to the admissibility of the expert&#x27;s testimony if there are questions about its relevance, or its validity and reliability (in the United States - the rules vary by country and jurisdiction). Regardless of who calls in the expert, it is the judge who determines whether or not the expert witness will be accepted through a voir dire process of qualification.

=== Research ===
Forensic psychology researchers make scientific discoveries relevant to psychology and the law and sometimes provide expert witness testimony. These professionals usually have an advanced degree in psychology generally a PhD or similar. These professionals may be employed in various settings, such as: colleges and universities, research institutes, and government, private, or mental health agencies. Researchers test hypotheses empirically regarding issues related to psychology and the law, such as jury research and research on mental health law and policy evaluation. Their research may be published in forensic psychology journals such as &quot;Law and Human Behavior&quot; or &quot;Psychology, Public Policy, and Law&quot;, and more broadly, in basic psychology journals. Some famous psychologists in the field include Scott Lilienfeld, who was widely known for his scholarship on psychopathology and psychopathy; Saul Kassin, who is known for studying false confessions; Jennifer Skeem, who is known for studying justice-involved people with mental illness; Michael Saks, who is known for his contributions to jury research and improvements to forensic science; Barbara Spellman, who is known for her cognitive psychology-law work as well as for her open science leadership; and Elizabeth Loftus and Gary Wells, who are both known for their research on eyewitness memory.

=== Education ===
Academic forensic psychologists teach, research, train, and supervise students, among other education-related activities. These professionals also have an advanced degree in psychology (most likely a PhD) and are most often employed at colleges and universities. In addition to holding professorships, forensic psychologists may engage in education by presenting research, hosting talks about a particular subject, or engaging with and educating the community about a relevant forensic psychology topic.

=== Advocacy ===
Through advocacy, forensic psychologists can use psychological research to influence laws and policies. These may be related to certain movements, such as Black Lives Matter or the Me Too movement, or may even be related to certain civil rights that are being overlooked.

== Forensic psychological evaluations ==

=== Common types of evaluations ===

==== Forensic assessments of competencies ====
Competence, in a legal setting, refers to the defendant&#x27;s ability to appreciate and understand the charges against them and what is happening in the legal proceedings, as well as their ability to help the lawyer understand and defend their case. Though it is the psychologist&#x27;s responsibility to assess for competence, it is ultimately up to the judge to decide whether the defendant is competent or not. If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the psychologist must then give a recommendation on whether or not the defendant can be restored to competence through treatment or if the charges should be dropped completely due to incompetence. Potential causes of incompetence include brain damage, the occurrence of a psychotic episode, a mental disorder, or a developmental disability.

Multiple cases have helped define competence. In Dusky v. United States (1960), the case upheld the Youtsey v. United States ruling and set specific criteria for competence. These include having a rational and factual understanding of court proceedings and being able to consult with an attorney in a rational manner.

==== Forensic assessment of insanity ====
Insanity, as opposed to competence, refers to an individual&#x27;s mental state at the time of the crime rather than at the time of the trial. According to legal principles of insanity, it is only acceptable to judge, find someone criminally responsible, and punish a defendant if that individual was sane at the time of the crime. In order to be considered sane, the defendant must have exhibited both &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus&quot;. &quot;Mens rea&quot;, translated to &quot;guilty mind&quot;, indicates that the individual exhibited free will and some intent to do harm at the time of the crime. &quot;Actus reus&quot; refers to the voluntary committing of an unlawful act.

The insanity defense acknowledges that, while an unlawful act did occur, the individual displayed a lack of &quot;mens rea&quot;. The burden of proof in determining if a defendant is insane lies with the defense team. A notable case relating to this type of assessment is that of &quot;Ford v. Wainwright&quot;, in which it was decided that forensic psychologists must be appointed to assess the competency of an inmate to be executed in death penalty cases.

There are various definitions of insanity acknowledged within the legal system. The M&#x27;Naghten/McNaugton rule (1843) defines insanity as the individual not understanding the nature and quality of his or her acts or that these acts were wrong due to a mental disease or defect. This is also referred to as the cognitive capacity test. Meanwhile, the Durham Test (established in Durham v. United States, 1954) states that one can be declared insane if the actions were caused by a mental disorder. The vague nature of this description causes this definition to only be used in one state (New Hampshire). The final definition acknowledged within the courts is the Brawner Rule (U.S. v. Brawner, 1972), also referred to as the American Law Institute Standard. This definition posits that, due to a mental disease or defect, an individual is considered insane if unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of an act and are unable to conform their behavior to the dictates of the law.

Evaluating insanity involves using crime scene analysis to determine the mental state at the time of the crime, establishing a diagnosis, interviewing the defendant and any other relevant witnesses, and verifying impressions of the defendant.

Criteria for insanity can vary by state.

==== Violence risk assessment ====
Violence risk assessment evaluates how dangerous an individual is and the risk of them re-offending, also referred to as recidivism. Risk assessments are used in sentencing and affect the possibility of an inmate receiving parole or being released from prison. Imposition of the death penalty often requires a consideration of &quot;future dangerousness,&quot; for which risk assessment can play a vital role.

Although there are many advocates for the use of risk assessment in sentencing, there are others who question whether risk assessments are accurate enough to be relied upon when making these consequential legal decisions. Risk assessment, as with any attempt to understand future behavior, is very difficult, especially because &quot;risk&quot; isn&#x27;t always defined the same way in different legal settings. There is a wide research literature on risk assessment, but the information is varied and sometimes contradictory, and bias can play a role in risk assessment.

* Types of violence risk assessments. There are several different methods of risk assessment, the main five of which are unstructured clinical assessment, anamnestic assessment, structured professional judgment, actuarial assessment, and adjusted actuarial assessment.
** &quot;Unstructured clinical assessment&quot; is a form of risk assessment in which the forensic examiner or clinician decides both what information to use and how to use it to determine risk based on their clinical judgment. The information used in these types of assessments tends to come from in-depth interviews with the examinee, as well as collateral interviews with known personal contacts, the results of psychological testing, and historical records. Because these assessments rely heavily on the individual clinician&#x27;s judgment, the interrater reliability for this method of assessing risk tends to be low. According to most research on predictive validity, unstructured clinical assessment is less accurate at predicting risk than other, more structured methods (though there have been some issues raised with the evidence supporting this claim).
** &quot;Anamnestic assessment&quot; is another type, which is a form of clinical risk assessment that is focused on risk factors specific to the individual being examined. This type of risk assessment tends to be used for assessing violence risk, and relies heavily on an examinee&#x27;s past history of violent behavior to identify risk factors for that individual behaving aggressively again, rather than risk factors for violence in general. Because these risk assessments are based on clinical interviews and tailored to the individual in question, they can be useful for determining ways to reduce an individual&#x27;s violence risk, but they suffer from the same limitations as general unstructured clinical assessment in terms of interrater reliability.
** &quot;Structured professional judgement&quot; (SPJ) is similar to unstructured clinical assessment in that the examiner still makes the final decision about risk, but it is more structured because these tools give the examiner specific, empirically based factors to focus on when assessing risk. Because of the more structured nature of these assessments, the interrater reliability of risk assessments done using these tools tends to be higher than that of those done using completely unstructured clinical assessment, and some argue the accuracy is higher than other types of assessment including actuarial methods, but there are questions about the legitimacy of these claims. Additionally, because most actuarial risk assessment tools are based on static (or unchanging) risk factors, SPJ tools tend to be better at identifying dynamic risk factors (which can be changed), and thus can be more useful in treatment settings than actuarial assessments. 
** &quot;Actuarial risk assessment&quot; is a more objective method of risk assessment that involves structured tools and algorithms that combine certain risk factors to produce a risk score or rating. The algorithm tells evaluators both which factors to pay attention to and how to weigh and combine them to produce the risk score. The risk factors included in actuarial tools are empirically linked to violence or recidivism risk and tend to be more static (permanent, unchanging) than dynamic (changeable). Because actuarial risk assessment tools provide the most guidance and involve the least amount of clinician judgment, they tend to have higher interrater reliability and to be more accurate than unstructured clinical assessment. Two example actuarial tools for assessing violence risk are the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) and the Classification of Violence Risk (COVR). An example actuarial tool for assessing sexual recidivism risk is the Static-99 Revised (Static-99R).
** &quot;Adjusted actuarial risk assessment&quot; is a combination of unstructured clinical assessment and actuarial risk assessment. In adjusted actuarial assessment, evaluators use an actuarial method to determine risk, and then adjust the score produced by the algorithm based on their own clinical judgment. This type of risk assessment is meant to make actuarial instruments more flexible and adaptable to the facts of a specific case; however, supporters of the actuarial technique tend to criticize this method as forgoing the main benefit of actuarial risk assessment—the lack of subjectivity—by reintroducing clinician judgment after a risk assessment score has been calculated.

==== Other types of evaluations ====
While insanity and competency assessments are among the most common criminal assessments administered within the legal system, there are several other types implemented. Some of these include death penalty case assessments, assessments of child sexual abuse, assessments for child custody or divorce cases, civil court assessments, and immigration/asylum cases.

* Immigration/asylum evaluations. In removal proceedings, the judge or parties may request the assistance of a forensic psychologist for those individuals eligible to apply for various forms of immigration benefits. There are eight grounds for an individual to apply for which are hardship, risk for torture, asylum, domestic violence, ANAC (abused, neglected, or abandoned children), discretionary determinations, risk assessment, and competence to proceed. Each removal proceeding is as unique as the individual on trial which is where mental health professionals play a crucial role in helping document their experiences as many individuals may or may not have proof to support their stories. In the case that an individual does apply for relief/protection from removal, a psychological evaluation is conducted by a forensic psychologist to help the court determine if the individual meets the requirements for the type of relief for which they are applying. Immigration evaluations are often done through a series of interviews with the individual and their family members that delve into their life of what led up to the migration, medical information such as history and physical examinations, social background information, and their current level of cognitive and psychological functioning.

===Distinction between forensic and therapeutic evaluation===
A forensic psychologist&#x27;s interactions with and ethical responsibilities to the client differ widely from those of a psychologist dealing with a client in a clinical setting.
* Scope. Rather than the broad set of issues a psychologist addresses in a clinical setting, a forensic psychologist addresses a narrowly defined set of events or interactions of a nonclinical nature.
* Importance of client&#x27;s perspective. A clinician places primary importance on understanding the client&#x27;s unique point of view, while a forensic psychologist is interested in accuracy, and the client&#x27;s viewpoint is secondary.
* Voluntariness. Usually, in a clinical setting, a psychologist is dealing with a voluntary client. A forensic psychologist evaluates clients by order of a judge or at the behest of an attorney.
* Autonomy. Voluntary clients have more latitude and autonomy regarding the assessment&#x27;s objectives. Any assessment usually takes their concerns into account. The objectives of a forensic examination are confined by the applicable statutes or common law elements that pertain to the legal issue in question.
* Threats to validity. While the client and therapist are working toward a common goal, although unconscious distortion may occur, in the forensic context there is a substantially greater likelihood of intentional and conscious distortion.
* Relationship and dynamics. While therapeutic interactions work toward developing a trusting, empathic therapeutic alliance, a forensic psychologist may not ethically nurture the client or act in a &quot;helping&quot; role, as the forensic evaluator has divided loyalties and there are substantial limits on confidentiality they can guarantee the client. A forensic evaluator must always be aware of manipulation in the adversary context of a legal setting. These concerns mandate an emotional distance that is unlike a therapeutic interaction.
* Pace and setting. Unlike therapeutic interactions which may be guided by many factors, the forensic setting with its court schedules, limited resources, and other external factors places great time constraints on the evaluation without opportunities for revaluation. The forensic examiner focuses on the importance of accuracy and the finality of legal dispositions.

== Ethics in forensic psychology ==

The ethical recommendations and expectations outlined for forensic psychology specifically are listed in the APA&#x27;s &quot;Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology&quot;. These guidelines involve reminders that forensic psychologists should value integrity, impartiality, and fairness, as well as avoid conflicts of interest when possible. These conflicts of interest may arise in situations in which the psychologist is working as a consultant to one side or another in a court case, when the psychologist is required to testify or evaluate something that collides with their own beliefs or values, or when a psychologist is faced with the decision of choosing between playing the role of an individual&#x27;s evaluator or treatment provider in a case. This final conflict of interest also relates to the ethical guidelines relating to having multiple relationships with clients. As a standard of ethics, forensic psychologists are expected to offer a certain amount of reduced fee or pro bono services for individuals who may not be able to afford hiring a psychologist for a court case otherwise. Other ethical guidelines involve receiving informed consent from clients before communicating information regarding their treatment or evaluations, respecting and acknowledging privacy, confidentiality, and privilege among clients, remaining impartial and objective when involved in a trial, and weighing the moral and ethical costs of complying with any court orders that may conflict with professional standards. Forensic Psychologists are required to work within the limitations of their competence, as determined by their education, training, supervised experiences, consultation, research, or professional experience.

=== Examples of skewed ethics ===
An example of skewed ethics in forensic psychology would be the different tests used to measure the command of authority. Two very infamous cases of this would be the Stanford Prison Experiments and the Milgram experiment. The Stanford Prison Experiment put college aged students into a prison simulation where they were randomly assigned to fulfill the role of either “guards” or “prisoners” This case was found to be unethical because it was found to be harmful to the participant past what should have been allowed. Stanley Milgram conducted research on how far people would go to obey authority figure if another person was harmed in the process. How the situation influenced the individual proves as a way to draw conclusions about the individual and their upbringing. Forensic psychology finds this information useful to know when and how authority can affect a situation, but mostly to know the boundaries that research can be pushed and when something is deemed unethical.

== Consent ==
Consent plays a large role in Forensic Psychology. Informed consent is required for psychologists, and when services are required by law or another authority, psychologists must inform the individual of the nature of the anticipated services, including whether the services are court ordered or mandated and any limits of confidentiality, before proceeding, according to the APA ethics code 3.10(c). Additionally, standard 3.10(d) stipulates that consent needs to be well documented. Both the individual in question and the council that is representing them must provide their approval. If the person is legally unable to give their own consent then legal counsel for that individual must be sought. The person must be informed by the Forensic Psychologist of all the various guidelines pertaining to the expected services, including the extent of confidentiality.

== Confidentiality in Forensic psychology ==
A forensic psychologist&#x27;s primary responsibility is to safeguard their clients anonymity by taking appropriate measures and communicating any limitations, the client is trusting them to keep all topics discussed with them confidential. Only the clients or legally authorized person&#x27;s consent may be disclosed; without the clients consent, disclosure may only occur when required by law, when the psychologist utilizes the information for the clients protection or consultation, or both.

== Notable research in forensic psychology ==
* Maryanne Garry conducted research on imagination inflation, and whether imagining a childhood event inflates confidence that it occurred. The study investigated whether imagining a childhood event that did not happen increased individuals confidence that it did. The results suggested that participants who originally reported an event did not happen changed their mind after imagining the scenario. Moreover, Garry also conducted research that used the premise of misremembered events in relation to eye witnesses and their chance of accepting (and confirming) a suggested occurrence, even if it was not accurate to what they saw. The study found that 30% of participants met criteria for false memory and 43% met criteria for false memories.
* Research by Tess Neal found that while there are a number of psychometric measuring tools that are used by psychologists in legal cases, there are few challenges to the result they present. Neal&#x27;s publications also assist lawmakers&#x27; understanding as to when psychological assessments can be challenged; similarly, they help psychologists to see when their assessments can be strengthened.

<text>The al-Khisas raid, also known as the al-Khisas massacre, was an attack on the Palestinian village of al-Khisas carried out by the Palmach on December 18, 1947, during the 1948 Palestine war. 10-15 Palestinian villagers were killed in the attack, including 5 children.

==Background==

The attack took place during the civil war phase of the 1948 Palestine war and was conducted as a reprisal for the killing of a Jewish man near Al-Khisas. Local Palmach commanders decided to launch a retaliatory attack on the village, arguing that &quot;if there was no reaction to the murder, the Arabs would interpret this as a sign of weakness and an invitation to further attacks&quot;. The Haganah High Command approved the action on condition that the attack be directed against &quot;men only and they should burn [only] a few houses&quot;.

==The attack==
The massacre was carried out by the Palmach&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, which later became part of the Yiftach Brigade.

According to Haim Levenberg:
One unit attacked with hand-grenades a four-roomed house killing two men and five children, and wounding five other men. At the same time, another unit attacked a house in the village owned by Amir Al-Fa’ur of Syria, in which one Syrian and two Lebanese peasants were killed and another Lebanese and two local men were wounded. According to HQ British Troops in Palestine, the villagers did not use any firearms to defend themselves.

10-15 Palestinian villagers were killed in the attack, 5 of them children.

==Aftermath and reactions==

Following the attack a large number of al-Khisas&#x27; residents fled their homes, becoming a part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight.

The events led to an escalation in violence that rapidly spread through the Upper Galilee region; the region had generally been quiet before the massacre, which was blamed for unnecessarily widening the hostilities.

The Jewish leadership at the time sharply criticized the attack. Three weeks later, Arab forces crossed the Syrian border and carried out a reprisal attack on the kibbutz Kfar Szold, but suffered heavy losses and were repulsed.

On 1 January 1948, David Ben-Gurion wrote in his diary about the attack, stating:

&quot;The question is not if there is a necessity to retaliate ... We need strong and harsh retaliation ... When the family is known, we must be merciless in hitting them; including women and children, or our retaliation will not be efficient. No need to differentiate ... between the guilty and the innocent.&quot;
During the operation a female member of the battalion had refused to throw a grenade into a room in which she could hear a child crying; following the event the battalion&#x27;s commander Moshe Kelman argued that women should not be used on front line duties but should be used as &quot;cooks and service people.&quot;

On the night of 5 June 1949, the remaining inhabitants of Khisas were forcibly expelled as part of the 1949–1956 Palestinian expulsions. Some time after the village was destroyed.

<doc id="475044" wikidata="Q1343514" url="?curid=475044" title="Martin Delrio">
<text>Martin Anton Delrio SJ (; ; ; 17 May 1551 – 19 October 1608) was a Dutch Jesuit theologian. He studied at numerous institutions, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in law from Salamanca in 1574. After a period of political service in the Spanish Netherlands, he became a Jesuit in 1580.

He studied or taught at Jesuit colleges across Catholic Europe, including Bordeaux, Douai, Graz, Mainz, Leuven, and Salamanca. He was the friend of the Flemish humanist Justus Lipsius, a relative of Michel de Montaigne, and an enemy of the Protestant scholar Joseph Scaliger. He was the author of a large number of books, including classical commentaries and works of biblical exegesis. He remains, however, best known for his six-volume &quot;Magical Investigations&quot; (1599–1600), a work on magic, superstition, and witchcraft.
==Life==
===Early life===
Martin Delrio was born in Antwerp on 17 May 1551, Whit Sunday, to the Spanish merchant Antonio del Río (d. 17 February 1586) and his wife Eleonora López de Villanova (d. 21 April 1602). The Del Río family were part of a sizeable Spanish community in Antwerp, more than 200 merchants were active in Antwerp in 1540. Young Martin studied at a Latin school in nearby Lier and soon revealed himself as a childhood prodigy. He matriculated at the Old University of Leuven on 1 December 1563, at the age of 12.

There he studied under the humanist Cornelius Valerius and met a number of other young promising scholars, including Andreas Schott, Willem Canter, and Justus Lipsius. In middle age their friendship would significantly change the course of both their lives. Delrio&#x27;s first publication, an edition of the late Roman grammarian Gaius Iulius Solinus, was based on a manuscript borrowed from Lipsius and included suggested emendations by his tutor Valerius. Delrio also published an edition of Claudian. He was particularly proud of the edition of Senecan tragedy, published in 1576 but which he (falsely) claimed to have completed before his twentieth birthday.

His travels during his &quot;peregrinatio academica&quot; are difficult to follow. He can be placed at the University of Paris in 1567 and 1568. He also spent some time in Douai where he refused to share a bed with an unnamed famous man (cited by his 1609 Jesuit hagiography as proof of his chastity). In 1572 he matriculated at the University of Salamanca on 1 December 1572 and graduated two years later. At Salamanca he would see ‘the remnant of an evil gymnasium’ where Muslims had allegedly taught magic.

===Political career===
Martin Delrio was never destined for one of the religious orders. His family had originally destined him for a political career. His law degree from Salamanca was part of this requirement. The Spanish crown since the days of Catholic Monarchs had particularly valued such degrees. Equally valued were titles of nobility. A legacy left by Martin&#x27;s grandfather was used to buy him the title of Lord of Aartselaar. On 7 September 1561, at the age of 10, Martin Delrio made his official entry, swearing an oath in which he promised to protect widows and orphans. The Delrio family also paid host to a number of prominent figures on visits to Antwerp, including Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle and Anne of Austria, Queen of Spain, Philip II&#x27;s fourth wife.

With the onset of the Dutch Revolt members of the family found employment with the Council of Troubles, the repressive institution set up by the new governor-general Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. A cousin, Luís del Río, was one of the councillors. Martin&#x27;s father Antonio later became treasurer general of confiscations, in charge of seizing assets. Martin himself would after his return from Spain (sometime in 1576 or early 1577) follow suit. The new governor-general Don John of Austria first made peace and then broke it. Soon after, on 29 October 1577, Don John appointed Martin to the Council of Brabant. Credentials or qualifications were irrelevant; with the exception of one loyalist member who fled to Paris, none of the existing councillors had decided to follow Don John.

Despite Martin&#x27;s appointment and rapid promotion (he would be made vice-chancellor of Brabant in July 1578), these were tragic years for the Delrio family. Luís was arrested by the rebels, later released but soon died. Martin&#x27;s father Antonio evaded capture and died a penniless exile in Lisbon. Martin&#x27;s career also faltered. After the death of Don John, the new governor-general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma changed course, embarking on a campaign reconciliation. Little attention was paid to those whose loyalty could be taken for granted. Martin seems to have lost his position as vice-chancellor. Another victim seems to have been the memoirs which Delrio composed in honour of his patron Don John of Austria and in ostensible imitation of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;. These remained unpublished until the late nineteenth century.

===Jesuit career===
On 27 December 1579 Martin Delrio wrote from Maastricht to the Jesuit General Everard Mercurian seeking to join the Society of Jesus. Delrio professed a sincere conversion to the religious life, but with his career side-lined and his family connections either dead or in exile he might also have had little choice. At the same time his close personal involvement as well as his family&#x27;s role in the Dutch Revolt also meant that Martin could only ever see the conflict in religious terms. Not waiting for a reply he headed for Spain entering the Society of Jesus on 9 May 1580.

This by no means put an end to his itinerant existence. When, in 1584, it was decided that he should return to the Low Countries for mission work, he stopped in Bordeaux and stayed there for two years. Whether he met Bordeaux&#x27;s mayor, the famous essayist Michel de Montaigne, while there, is unclear, but the two men were second cousins on their maternal side. It is at this time that Delrio began work on his first publication since his entry in the Society, a substantially revised and expanded version of his edition of Senecan Tragedy. The &quot;Syntagma tragoediae latinae&quot; (finally published in 1593–94) was at once a renunciation of secular (classical) interests and an acknowledgement of the seminal role the classics played in Jesuit education.

His travels after 1586 are relatively unclear. In 1587, he was in Mainz, in 1589 in Leuven and Douai, and in 1591–1593 in Liège. At last in 1594 he obtained the position of professor of biblical exegesis at the Jesuit college of Leuven. He would teach (and later publish on) the Old Testament Song of Songs and the Book of Lamentations. (His successor in that chair would be Cornelius a Lapide, possibly the most famous exegete of the Counter-Reformation.) During these years he also gave a number of sermons in honour of the Virgin Mary, which he collected and published under the title &quot;Florida Mariana&quot; (Marian Blossoms, 1598).

In Leuven he also reunited with his university friend Justus Lipsius, who credited Delrio as the &quot;author of his conversion&quot;. Although this vastly overstates the Jesuit&#x27;s actual role, it did lead to their names and reputations coming forever intertwined. Lipsius, one of the leading humanists of his day, had spent thirteen years teaching in Protestant Leiden and was a bone both Catholics and Protestants fought over. Delrio, whose orthodoxy was never in doubt, posthumously became Lipsius&#x27;s guarantor.

The founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola had wanted obedience to be the Society&#x27;s hallmark. Its &quot;Constitutions&quot; likened the individual Jesuit to &quot;a lifeless body&quot;. Delrio&#x27;s time in Leuven, however, was almost as turbulent as his time in Bordeaux, when he refused to return to the Low Countries. In letters to the Jesuit General in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, he denounced first the rector of the college and later the provincial hierarchy.

This led the Jesuit to be shipped to Graz in Austria, close to the frontier with the Ottoman Empire. Here he impressed the ultra-orthodox Archduke Ferdinand (who as Ferdinand II would plunge the Holy Roman Empire into the Thirty Years&#x27; War). After Delrio&#x27;s departure for Spain Ferdinand would insistently call for his return.

Delrio had never wanted to leave Spain. When in Leuven he actively lobbied to be returned there, he was sent to Graz instead. In 1604, the Long Turkish War at last provided an excuse for travel to Spain. Delrio spent some time teaching at Valladolid and Salamanca, where he despaired of the quality of the students, describing them as &quot;students for our saliva&quot;. In the autumn of 1607 Delrio petitioned Rome to be allowed to return to the Low Countries, which was granted. He left Valladolid on 18 August. On 19 October 1608, three days after his return to Leuven, Delrio breathed his last, the final stop for a person who could apparently not find peace anywhere.
==Work==
Martin Delrio&#x27;s &quot;Magical Investigations&quot; ( or &quot;&quot;) first appeared in three volumes in Leuven in 1599 and 1600, printed by Gerard Rivius. It quickly became extraordinarily popular. It was still reprinted in Cologne in 1720 and 1755 and in Venice in 1746, long after the printing of rival works had ceased. Historians have traditionally regarded the work as only a receptacle of the ideas of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (&quot;Hammer of the Witches&quot;, 1486).

Delrio was credited with importing the beliefs of the &quot;Malleus&quot; into the Low Countries. Hugh Trevor Roper, for instance, described the book as the &quot;new Catholic &quot;Malleus&quot;&quot; and claimed that &quot;[i]t was the Catholic reconquest which introduced witch-burning into Flanders, and the Jesuit del Rio who would keep it up&quot;, holding the Jesuit directly responsible for the burnings.

Historians have also believed that the work was based on practical experience. Wolfgang Behringer argued that Delrio drew on his experience as a young magistrate, which made him in effect &quot;a colleague of Nicolas Remy&quot;. However, it is now recognized that Delrio&#x27;s personal experience with witchcraft was really rather limited and that he may never have met an alleged witch.

The &quot;Investigations&quot; was—in keeping with Delrio&#x27;s other publications—a work of textual scholarship. It was based on Delrio&#x27;s knowledge of the classics and familiarity with Church history. Hagiography forms a particular source of inspiration. (Delrio&#x27;s student Heribert Rosweyde would play an important role in the emergence of the Acta Sanctorum, a Catholic encyclopedia of saints lives.) Delrio also drew on histories of other countries and continents, as well as Jesuit reports from the New World. The textual foundation of the work made it difficult to critique and to replace.

In contrast to works by Henry Boguet and Pierre de Lancre, Delrio&#x27;s was not based on personal experience. His credibility could less easily be called into question. It has, however, been suggested that, divorced from the real world, as a result its relevance for witchcraft persecutions was rather limited. Sceptics seized on the work&#x27;s more moderate comments, to Delrio&#x27;s annoyance. A translation into English began appearing in 2000, making the work accessible to a wider audience.

<text>Old Chinese, also called Archaic Chinese in older works, is the oldest attested stage of Chinese, and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese. The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BC, in the Late Shang period. Bronze inscriptions became plentiful during the following Zhou dynasty. The latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature, including classical works such as the &quot;Analects&quot;, the &quot;Mencius&quot;, and the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. These works served as models for Literary Chinese (or Classical Chinese), which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century, thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese.

Old Chinese was written with several early forms of Chinese characters, including oracle bone, bronze, and seal scripts. Throughout the Old Chinese period, there was a close correspondence between a character and a monosyllabic and monomorphemic word. Although the script is not alphabetic, the majority of characters were created based on phonetic considerations. At first, words that were difficult to represent visually were written using a &quot;borrowed&quot; character for a similar-sounding word (rebus principle). Later on, to reduce ambiguity, new characters were created for these phonetic borrowings by appending a radical that conveys a broad semantic category, resulting in compound &quot;xingsheng&quot; (phono-semantic) characters (). For the earliest attested stage of Old Chinese of the late Shang dynasty, the phonetic information implicit in these &quot;xingsheng&quot; characters which are grouped into phonetic series, known as the &quot;xiesheng&quot; series&quot;,&quot; represents the only direct source of phonological data for reconstructing the language. The corpus of &quot;xingsheng&quot; characters was greatly expanded in the following Zhou dynasty. In addition, the rhymes of the earliest recorded poems, primarily those of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, provide an extensive source of phonological information with respect to syllable finals for the Central Plains dialects during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn periods. Similarly, the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; provides rhyme data for the dialect spoken in the Chu region during the Warring States period. These rhymes, together with clues from the phonetic components of &quot;xingsheng&quot; characters, allow most characters attested in Old Chinese to be assigned to one of 30 or 31 rhyme groups. For late Old Chinese of the Han period, the modern Southern Min languages, the oldest layer of Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, and a few early transliterations of foreign proper names, as well as names for non-native flora and fauna, also provide insights into language reconstruction.

Although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differed from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids. Most recent reconstructions also describe Old Chinese as a language without tones, but having consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, which developed into tone distinctions in Middle Chinese.

Most researchers trace the core vocabulary of Old Chinese to Sino-Tibetan, with much early borrowing from neighbouring languages.
During the Zhou period, the originally monosyllabic vocabulary was augmented with polysyllabic words formed by compounding and reduplication, although monosyllabic vocabulary was still predominant. Unlike Middle Chinese and the modern Chinese languages, Old Chinese had a significant amount of derivational morphology. Several affixes have been identified, including ones for the verbification of nouns, conversion between transitive and intransitive verbs, and formation of causative verbs. Like modern Chinese, it appears to be uninflected, though a pronoun case and number system seems to have existed during the Shang and early Zhou but was already in the process of disappearing by the Classical period. Likewise, by the Classical period, most morphological derivations had become unproductive or vestigial, and grammatical relationships were primarily indicated using word order and grammatical particles.

== Classification ==
Middle Chinese and its southern neighbours Kra–Dai, Hmong–Mien and the Vietic branch of Austroasiatic have similar tone systems, syllable structure, grammatical features and lack of inflection, but these are believed to be areal features spread by diffusion rather than indicating common descent.
The most widely accepted hypothesis is that Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, together with Burmese, Tibetan and many other languages spoken in the Himalayas and the Southeast Asian Massif.
The evidence consists of some hundreds of proposed cognate words, including such basic vocabulary as the following:

Although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as Indo-European or Austronesian.
Although Old Chinese is by far the earliest attested member of the family, its logographic script does not clearly indicate the pronunciation of words.
Other difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.
In addition, many of the smaller languages are poorly described because they are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, including several sensitive border zones.

Initial consonants generally correspond regarding place and manner of articulation, but voicing and aspiration are much less regular, and prefixal elements vary widely between languages. Some researchers believe that both these phenomena reflect lost minor syllables. Proto-Tibeto-Burman as reconstructed by Benedict and Matisoff lacks an aspiration distinction on initial stops and affricates. Aspiration in Old Chinese often corresponds to pre-initial consonants in Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese, and is believed to be a Chinese innovation arising from earlier prefixes. Proto-Sino-Tibetan is reconstructed with a six-vowel system as in recent reconstructions of Old Chinese, with the Tibeto-Burman languages distinguished by the merger of the mid-central vowel with . The other vowels are preserved by both, with some alternation between and , and between and .

== Texts ==

The earliest known written records of the Chinese language were found at the Yinxu site near modern Anyang identified as the last capital of the Shang dynasty, and date from about 1250 BC. These are the oracle bones, short inscriptions carved on turtle plastrons and ox scapulae for divinatory purposes, as well as a few brief bronze inscriptions. The language written is undoubtedly an early form of Chinese, but is difficult to interpret due to the limited subject matter and high proportion of proper names. Only half of the 4,000 characters used have been identified with certainty. Little is known about the grammar of this language, but it seems much less reliant on grammatical particles than Classical Chinese.

From early in the Western Zhou period, around 1000 BC, the most important recovered texts are bronze inscriptions, many of considerable length. These texts are found throughout the Zhou area. Although their language changed over time, it was highly uniform across this range at each point in time, suggesting that it reflected the prestige form used by the Zhou elite. Even longer pre-Classical texts on a wide range of subjects have also been transmitted through the literary tradition. The oldest sections of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; and the &quot;I Ching&quot;, also date from the early Zhou period, and closely resemble the bronze inscriptions in vocabulary, syntax, and style. A greater proportion of this more varied vocabulary has been identified than for the oracular period.

The four centuries preceding the unification of China in 221 BC (the later Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period) constitute the Chinese classical period in the strict sense. There are many bronze inscriptions from this period, but they are vastly outweighed by a rich literature written in ink on bamboo and wooden slips and (toward the end of the period) silk. Although these are perishable materials, a significant number of texts were transmitted as copies, and a few of these survived to the present day as the received classics. Works from this period, including the &quot;Analects&quot;, the &quot;Mencius&quot; and the &quot;Commentary of Zuo&quot;, have been admired as models of prose style by later generations. As a result, the syntax and vocabulary of Old Chinese was preserved in Literary Chinese (&quot;wenyan&quot;), the standard for formal writing in China and neighboring Sinosphere countries until the early 20th century.

==Script==
Each character of the script represented a single Old Chinese morpheme, originally identical to a word. Most scholars believe that these words were monosyllabic. William Baxter and Laurent Sagart propose that some words consisted of a minor syllable followed by a full syllable, as in modern Khmer, but still written with a single character. The development of characters to signify the words of the language follows the same three stages that characterized Egyptian hieroglyphs, Mesopotamian cuneiform script and the Maya script.

Some words could be represented by pictures (later stylized) such as &#x27;sun&#x27;, &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;tree, wood&#x27;, by abstract symbols such as &#x27;three&#x27; and &#x27;up&#x27;, or by composite symbols such as &#x27;forest&#x27; (two trees).
About 1,000 of the oracle bone characters, nearly a quarter of the total, are of this type, though 300 of them have not yet been deciphered.
Though the pictographic origins of these characters are apparent, they have already undergone extensive simplification and conventionalization.
Evolved forms of most of these characters are still in common use today.

Next, words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were signified by borrowing characters of pictorial origin representing similar-sounding words (the &quot;rebus strategy&quot;):
* The word &#x27;tremble&#x27; was originally written with the character for &#x27;chestnut&#x27;.
* The pronoun and modal particle was written with the character originally representing &#x27;winnowing basket&#x27;.
Sometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27;, a borrowing of &#x27;mother&#x27;.
Later, phonetic loans were systematically disambiguated by the addition of semantic indicators, usually to the less common word:
* The word &#x27;tremble&#x27; was later written with the character , formed by adding the symbol , a variant of &#x27;heart&#x27;.
* The less common original word &#x27;winnowing basket&#x27; came to be written with the compound , obtained by adding the symbol &#x27;bamboo&#x27; to the character.
Such phono-semantic compound characters were already used extensively on the oracle bones, and the vast majority of characters created since then have been of this type.
In the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, a dictionary compiled in the 2nd century, 82% of the 9,353 characters are classified as phono-semantic compounds.
In the light of the modern understanding of Old Chinese phonology, researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds also have a phonetic nature.
These developments were already present in the oracle bone script, possibly implying a significant period of development prior to the extant inscriptions.
This may have involved writing on perishable materials, as suggested by the appearance on oracle bones of the character &#x27;records&#x27;.
The character is thought to depict bamboo or wooden strips tied together with leather thongs, a writing material known from later archaeological finds.

Development and simplification of the script continued during the pre-Classical and Classical periods, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.
The language developed compound words, though almost all constituent morphemes could also be used as independent words.
Hundreds of morphemes of two or more syllables also entered the language, and were written with one phono-semantic compound character per syllable.
During the Warring States period, writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.
The most conservative script prevailed in the western state of Qin, which would later impose its standard on the whole of China.

==Phonology==

Old Chinese phonology has been reconstructed using a unique method relying on textual sources.
The starting point is the &quot;Qieyun&quot; dictionary (601 AD), which classifies the reading pronunciation of each character found in texts to that time within a precise, but abstract, phonological system.
Scholars have sought to assign phonetic values to these Middle Chinese categories by comparing them with modern varieties of Chinese, Sino-Xenic pronunciations and transcriptions.
Next, the phonology of Old Chinese is reconstructed by comparing the &quot;Qieyun&quot; categories to the rhyming practice of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (early 1st millennium BC) and the shared phonetic components of Chinese characters, some of which are slightly older.
More recent efforts have supplemented this method with evidence from Old Chinese derivational morphology, from Chinese varieties preserving distinctions not found in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, such as Min and Waxiang, and from early transcriptions and loans.

Although many details are still disputed, recent formulations are in substantial agreement on the core issues.
For example, the Old Chinese initial consonants recognized by Li Fang-Kuei and William Baxter are given below, with Baxter&#x27;s (mostly tentative) additions given in parentheses:

Various initial clusters have been proposed, especially clusters of with other consonants, but this area remains unsettled.

Bernhard Karlgren and many later scholars posited the medials , and the combination to explain the retroflex and palatal obstruents of Middle Chinese, as well as many of its vowel contrasts.
 is generally accepted. However, although the distinction denoted by is universally accepted, its realization as a palatal glide has been challenged on a number of grounds, and a variety of different realizations have been used in recent constructions.

Reconstructions since the 1980s usually propose six vowels:
Vowels could optionally be followed by the same codas as in Middle Chinese: a glide or , a nasal , or , or a stop , or . Some scholars also allow for a labiovelar coda .
Most scholars now believe that Old Chinese lacked the tones found in later stages of the language, but had optional post-codas and , which developed into the Middle Chinese rising and departing tones respectively.

==Grammar==

Little is known of the grammar of the language of the Oracular and pre-Classical periods, as the texts are often of a ritual or formulaic nature, and much of their vocabulary has not been deciphered. In contrast, the rich literature of the Warring States period has been extensively analysed. Having no inflection, Old Chinese was heavily reliant on word order, grammatical particles, and inherent word classes.

=== Word classes ===
Classifying Old Chinese words is not always straightforward, as words were not marked for function, word classes overlapped, and words of one class could sometimes be used in roles normally reserved for a different class. The task is more difficult with written texts than it would have been for speakers of Old Chinese, because the derivational morphology is often hidden by the writing system. For example, the verb &#x27;to block&#x27; and the derived noun &#x27;frontier&#x27; were both written with the same character .

Personal pronouns exhibit a wide variety of forms in Old Chinese texts, possibly due to dialectal variation.
There were two groups of first-person pronouns:
* , , and 
* , and 

In the oracle bone inscriptions, the pronouns were used by the king to refer to himself, and the forms for the Shang people as a whole.
This distinction is largely absent in later texts, and the forms disappeared during the classical period.
In the post-Han period, (modern Mandarin ) came to be used as the general first-person pronoun.

Second-person pronouns included , , and .
The forms and continued to be used interchangeably until their replacement by the northwestern variant (modern Mandarin ) in the Tang period.
However, in some Min dialects the second-person pronoun is derived from .

Case distinctions were particularly marked among third-person pronouns.
There was no third-person subject pronoun, but , originally a distal demonstrative, came to be used as a third-person object pronoun in the classical period.
The possessive pronoun was originally , replaced in the classical period by .
In the post-Han period, came to be used as the general third-person pronoun.
It survives in some Wu dialects, but has been replaced by a variety of forms elsewhere.

There were demonstrative and interrogative pronouns, but no indefinite pronouns with the meanings &#x27;something&#x27; or &#x27;nothing&#x27;.
The distributive pronouns were formed with a suffix:
* &#x27;which one&#x27; from &#x27;who&#x27;
* &#x27;each one&#x27; from &#x27;all&#x27;
* &#x27;someone&#x27; from &#x27;there is&#x27;
* &#x27;no-one&#x27; from &#x27;there is no&#x27;

As in the modern language, localizers (compass directions, &#x27;above&#x27;, &#x27;inside&#x27; and the like) could be placed after nouns to indicate relative positions.
They could also precede verbs to indicate the direction of the action. Nouns denoting times were another special class (time words); they usually preceded the subject to specify the time of an action. However the classifiers so characteristic of Modern Chinese only became common in the Han period and the subsequent Northern and Southern dynasties.

Old Chinese verbs, like their modern counterparts, did not show tense or aspect; these could be indicated with adverbs or particles if required. Verbs could be transitive or intransitive. As in the modern language, adjectives were a special kind of intransitive verb, and a few transitive verbs could also function as modal auxiliaries or as prepositions.

Adverbs described the scope of a statement or various temporal relationships. They included two families of negatives starting with and , such as and . Modern northern varieties derive the usual negative from the first family, while southern varieties preserve the second. The language had no adverbs of degree until late in the Classical period.

Particles were function words serving a range of purposes. As in the modern language, there were sentence-final particles marking imperatives and yes/no questions. Other sentence-final particles expressed a range of connotations, the most important being , expressing static factuality, and , implying a change. Other particles included the subordination marker and the nominalizing particles (agent) and (object).
Conjunctions could join nouns or clauses.

=== Sentence structure ===
As with English and modern Chinese, Old Chinese sentences can be analysed as a subject (a noun phrase, sometimes understood) followed by a predicate, which could be of either nominal or verbal type.

Before the Classical period, nominal predicates consisted of a copular particle followed by a noun phrase:

The negated copula is attested in oracle bone inscriptions, and later fused as .
In the Classical period, nominal predicates were constructed with the sentence-final particle instead of the copula , but was retained as the negative form, with which was optional:

The copular verb () of Literary and Modern Chinese dates from the Han period.
In Old Chinese the word was a near demonstrative (&#x27;this&#x27;).

As in Modern Chinese, but unlike most Tibeto-Burman languages, the basic word order in a verbal sentence was subject–verb–object:

Besides inversions for emphasis, there were two exceptions to this rule: a pronoun object of a negated sentence or an interrogative pronoun object would be placed before the verb:

An additional noun phrase could be placed before the subject to serve as the topic. Like the modern language, Old Chinese used &quot;in situ&quot; questions, forming yes–no questions by adding a sentence-final particle, and open questions by substituting an interrogative pronoun for the requested element.

=== Modification ===
In general, Old Chinese modifiers preceded the words they modified. Thus relative clauses were placed before the noun, usually marked by the particle (in a role similar to Modern Chinese &quot;de&quot; ):

A common instance of this construction was adjectival modification, since the Old Chinese adjective was a type of verb (as in the modern language), but was usually omitted after monosyllabic adjectives.

Similarly, adverbial modifiers, including various forms of negation, usually occurred before the verb. As in the modern language, time adjuncts occurred either at the start of the sentence or before the verb, depending on their scope, while duration adjuncts were placed after the verb. Instrumental and place adjuncts were usually placed after the verb phrase. These later moved to a position before the verb, as in the modern language.

== Vocabulary ==
The improved understanding of Old Chinese phonology has enabled the study of the origins of Chinese words (rather than the characters with which they are written).
Most researchers trace the core vocabulary to a Sino-Tibetan ancestor language, with much early borrowing from other neighbouring languages.
The traditional view was that Old Chinese was an isolating language.
Linguists still believe that the language lacked inflection, but it has become clear that words could be formed by derivational affixation, reduplication and compounding.

=== Loanwords ===
During the Old Chinese period, Chinese civilization expanded from a compact area around the lower Wei River and middle Yellow River eastwards across the North China Plain to Shandong and then south into the valley of the Yangtze. There are no records of the non-Chinese languages formerly spoken in those areas and subsequently displaced by the Chinese expansion.
However they are believed to have contributed to the vocabulary of Old Chinese, and may be the source of some of the many Chinese words whose origins are still unknown.

Jerry Norman and Mei Tsu-lin have identified early Austroasiatic loanwords in Old Chinese, possibly from the peoples of the lower Yangtze basin known to ancient Chinese as the Yue. For example, the early Chinese name ( ) for the Yangtze was later extended to a general word for &#x27;river&#x27; in south China.
Norman and Mei suggest that the word is cognate with Vietnamese (from *&quot;krong&quot;) and Mon &quot;kruŋ&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;.

Haudricourt and Strecker have proposed a number of borrowings from the Hmong–Mien languages. These include terms related to rice cultivation, which began in the middle Yangtze valley:
* ( ) &#x27;rice seedling&#x27; from proto-Hmong–Mien A,
* ( ) &#x27;unhulled rice&#x27; from proto-Hmong–Mien A.
Other words are believed to have been borrowed from languages to the south of the Chinese area, but it is not clear which was the original source, e.g.
* ( ) &#x27;elephant&#x27; can be compared with Mon &quot;coiŋ&quot;, proto-Tai and Burmese &quot;chaŋ&quot;.
* ( ) &#x27;chicken&#x27; versus proto-Tai , proto-Hmong–Mien and proto-Viet–Muong *&quot;r-ka&quot;.

In ancient times, the Tarim Basin was occupied by speakers of Indo-European Tocharian languages, the source of ( ) &#x27;honey&#x27;, from proto-Tocharian *&quot;ḿət(ə)&quot; (where *&quot;ḿ&quot; is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B &quot;mit&quot;), cognate with English &quot;&quot;.
The northern neighbours of Chinese contributed such words as ( ) &#x27;calf&#x27; – compare Mongolian &quot;tuɣul&quot; and Manchu &quot;tuqšan&quot;.

=== Affixation ===
Chinese philologists have long noted words with related meanings and similar pronunciations, sometimes written using the same character.
Henri Maspero attributed some of these alternations to consonant clusters resulting from derivational affixes.
Subsequent work has identified several such affixes, some of which appear to have cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.
A few of these were still productive or transparent in Old Chinese.

A common case is &quot;derivation by tone change&quot;, in which words in the departing tone appear to be derived from words in other tones.
If Haudricourt&#x27;s theory of the origin of the departing tone is accepted, these tonal derivations can be interpreted as the result of a derivational suffix with a range of functions.
As Tibetan has a similar suffix, it may be inherited from Sino-Tibetan.
The most common function was nominalization of verbs, as in the following examples:
* ( ) &#x27;to transmit&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;a record&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;to bring in&#x27; and &lt; ( ) &#x27;inside&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;to weave&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;silk cloth&#x27; (compare Written Tibetan &#x27;to weave&#x27; and &#x27;woven, cloth&#x27;)
The suffix also formed denominal verbs, as in these examples:
* ( ) &#x27;cap&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;to cap&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;clothes&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;to wear, to clothe&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;king&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;be king&#x27;
Another alternation involves transitive verbs with an unvoiced initial and passive or stative verbs with a voiced initial:
* ( ) &#x27;to see&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;to appear&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;to mix&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;mixed, confused&#x27;
* ( ) &#x27;to stretch&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;long&#x27;
Some scholars hold that the transitive verbs with voiceless initials are basic and the voiced initials reflect a de-transitivizing nasal prefix.
Others suggest that the transitive verbs were derived by the addition of a causative prefix to a stative verb, causing devoicing of the following voiced initial.
Both postulated prefixes have parallels in other Sino-Tibetan languages, in some of which they are still productive.
Several other affixes have been proposed.

The derivational affixes lost their productivity towards the end of the Zhou period, and their functions were taken over by forms such as auxiliary verbs.

=== Reduplication and compounding ===
Old Chinese morphemes were originally monosyllabic, but during the Western Zhou period many new disyllabic words entered the language.
By the classical period, 25–30% of the lexicon was polysyllabic, though monosyllabic words occurred more frequently and made up 80–90% of the text.
Disyllabic morphemes include the famous ( ) &#x27;butterfly&#x27; from the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;.

Many disyllabic, monomorphemic words, particularly names of insects, birds and plants, and expressive adjectives and adverbs, were formed by varieties of reduplication:
* full reduplication ( &#x27;repeated words&#x27;), in which the syllable is repeated, as in ( ) &#x27;tall and grand&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;happy and at ease&#x27;.
* rhyming semi-reduplication ( &#x27;repeated rhymes&#x27;), in which only the final is repeated, as in ( ) &#x27;elegant, beautiful&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;bollworm&#x27;. The initial of the second syllable is often or .
* alliterative semi-reduplication ( &#x27;paired initials&#x27;), in which the initial is repeated, as in ( ) &#x27;irregular, uneven&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;to crawl&#x27;.
* vowel alternation, especially of and , as in ( ) &#x27;busy&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;carefree and happy&#x27;. Alternation between and also occurred, as in ( ) &#x27;rushing (of wind or water)&#x27; and ( ) &#x27;cricket&#x27;.

More words, especially nouns, were formed by compounding, including:
* qualification of one noun by another (placed in front), as in ( ) &#x27;quince&#x27; (literally &#x27;tree-melon&#x27;), and ( ) &#x27;noon&#x27; (literally &#x27;middle-day&#x27;).
* verb–object compounds, as in ( ) &#x27;master of the household&#x27; (literally &#x27;manage-horse&#x27;), and ( ) &#x27;scribe&#x27; (literally &#x27;make-writing&#x27;).
However the components of compounds were not bound morphemes: they could still be used separately.
Compounding became more productive during the following Han period and has continued to the present day.

A number of bimorphemic syllables appeared in the Classical period, resulting from the fusion of words with following unstressed particles or pronouns.
Thus the negatives and are viewed as fusions of the negators and respectively with a third-person pronoun .

<doc id="475054" wikidata="Q547315" url="?curid=475054" title="Tattoo You">
<text>Tattoo You is the sixteenth U.K. and eighteenth U.S. studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 24 August 1981 by Rolling Stones Records. The album is mostly composed of studio outtakes recorded during the 1970s, and contains one of the band&#x27;s most well-known songs, &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, which hit number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; singles charts.

A combination of touring obligations and personal feuding between band members made it difficult to arrange dedicated recording sessions for the band&#x27;s follow-up to 1980&#x27;s &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;. As a result, the band&#x27;s production team combed through unused recordings from prior sessions, some dating back almost a decade. While a few of the songs were used essentially as-is in their original form, most of these earlier recordings were not complete, consisting of song fragments requiring much work. Studio time was booked throughout 1980 and 1981 and band members came in when available to finish off the tracks.

The credited members of the Rolling Stones for the album were vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts while older tracks feature former Stones guitarist Mick Taylor (&quot;Tops&quot;), keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and Billy Preston, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; session guitarist Wayne Perkins (&quot;Worried About You&quot;) and founding member Ian Stewart.

The album proved to be both a critical and commercial success upon release, reaching the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. To date, it is the final Rolling Stones album to reach the top position of the US charts, concluding the band&#x27;s string of eight consecutive number-one albums there, dating back to 1971&#x27;s &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.

In 1989, it was ranked No. 34 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 211 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then re-ranked number 213 in the 2012 revised list. Peter Corriston, who was responsible for the album cover&#x27;s concept origination, art direction and design, won a Grammy Award in the category of Best Album Package.

A remastered 40th-anniversary edition of the album was released on 22 October 2021. It features nine previously unreleased tracks and a 1982 concert at Wembley Stadium.

==Background==
&quot;Tattoo You&quot; is an album primarily composed of outtakes from previous recording sessions, some dating back a decade, with new vocals and overdubs. Along with two new songs, the Rolling Stones put together this collection to have a new album to promote for their worldwide American Tour 1981/European Tour 1982 beginning that September. Keith Richards commented in 1993:

&quot;The thing with &quot;Tattoo You&quot; wasn&#x27;t that we&#x27;d stopped writing new stuff, it was a question of time. We&#x27;d agreed we were going to go out on the road and we wanted to tour behind a record. There was no time to make a whole new album and make the start of the tour.&quot;

==Recording==
The album&#x27;s associate producer, Chris Kimsey, who had been associated with The Stones dating back to &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971) said, &quot;&quot;Tattoo You&quot; really came about because Mick and Keith were going through a period of not getting on. There was a need to have an album out, and I told everyone I could make an album from what I knew was still there.&quot; He began sifting through the band&#x27;s vaults: &quot;I spent three months going through (the recording tapes from) like the last four, five albums finding stuff that had been either forgotten about or at the time rejected. And then I presented it to the band and I said, &#x27;Hey, look guys, you&#x27;ve got all this great stuff sitting in the can and it&#x27;s great material, do something with it.&quot;

Many of the songs consisted at this point of instrumental backing tracks for which vocals had not been recorded. Jagger said in a 1995 interview, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t all outtakes; some of it was old songs... I had to write lyrics and melodies. A lot of them didn&#x27;t have anything, which is why they weren&#x27;t used at the time – because they weren&#x27;t complete. They were just bits, or they were from early takes&quot;. Despite the eclectic nature of the album, the Rolling Stones were able to divide &quot;Tattoo You&quot; into two distinct halves: a rock and roll side backed with one focusing on ballads.

The earliest songs used for &quot;Tattoo You&quot; are &quot;Tops&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;. The backing tracks for both songs were cut in late 1972 during the &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; (1973) sessions with Mick Taylor and not Ronnie Wood. Taylor, who was not credited, later demanded and received a share of the album&#x27;s royalties.

Dating from the &quot;Black and Blue&quot; sessions are the backing tracks for &quot;Slave&quot; and &quot;Worried About You&quot;. They feature Billy Preston on keyboards and Ollie E. Brown on percussion. Wayne Perkins plays the lead guitar on &quot;Worried About You&quot;.

The album opens with &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, originally rehearsed under the working title &quot;Never Stop&quot; and as a reggae-influenced number in 1978 during the &quot;Some Girls&quot; sessions, and the balance of it was recorded during these particular sessions in Paris (at Pathé Marconi studios) sessions where the more rock-infused track was recorded. &quot;Black Limousine&quot; was also worked on during these sessions.

The basic tracks for &quot;No Use in Crying&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Little T &amp; A&quot; came from the &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; sessions.

&quot;Hang Fire&quot; was worked on in both the &quot;Some Girls&quot; and &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; sessions.

The vocal parts for the songs on &quot;Tattoo You&quot; were overdubbed during sessions in October–November 1980 and April–June 1981. Jagger was the only member of the band present at some of these sessions. Other overdubs, such as Sonny Rollins&#x27; saxophone parts on &quot;Slave&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, were also added at these sessions. The album was mixed at Atlantic Studios, Electric Lady Studios, Hit Factory and Power Station in New York City.

==Release and aftermath==
&quot;Start Me Up&quot; was released in August 1981, just a week before &quot;Tattoo You&quot;, to a very strong response, reaching the top 10 in both the United States and UK, and number 1 in Australia. Widely considered one of the Stones&#x27; most infectious songs, it was enough to carry &quot;Tattoo You&quot; to No. 1 for nine weeks in the United States, while reaching No. 2 in the UK with solid sales. It has been certified 4× platinum in the United States alone. The critical reaction was positive, many feeling that &quot;Tattoo You&quot; was an improvement over &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; and a high-quality release. &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; and &quot;Hang Fire&quot; became Top 20 US hits as well.

&quot;Start Me Up&quot; would prove to be The Rolling Stones&#x27; last single to reach as high as No. 2 in the US, while &quot;Tattoo You&quot; is their last American No. 1 album to date.

The album title was originally planned to be simply &quot;Tattoo&quot;. Jagger claims to this day that even he has no clue how the &quot;You&quot; became attached to the title. The title caused friction between Jagger and Richards, with Richards suspecting that Jagger had changed the title without seeking his input. The album cover for &quot;Tattoo You&quot; had concept origination, art direction and design by Peter Corriston and illustration by Christian Piper. The album cover won the Grammy Award in 1982 in the Best Album Package category. It was the first Grammy Award for the Rolling Stones.

There were several videos directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg for this album including:

*&quot;Start Me Up&quot;, &quot;Hang Fire&quot; and &quot;Worried About You&quot;: Consisting of a standard band performance setting, miming to a backing tape.
*&quot;Neighbours&quot;: An homage to Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot;, it features the band playing in one apartment of an apartment building with various happenings seen in the windows of the other apartments: A working-class couple relaxing and making love, a tai chi practitioner exercising, and most notoriously, a man putting bloody body parts in a suitcase. This video was heavily censored when presented on television.
*&quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;: Filmed on location in New York City&#x27;s East Village, it consists of Richards walking down the street, meeting Jagger, who is sitting on the front steps of 96-98 St. Mark&#x27;s Place (the same building used by the designer Peter Corriston for cover art of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;) with several other men, who shake Richards&#x27; hand. They then proceed down the street and enter a bar where the rest of the band is waiting. The video also features current-guitarist Wood, rather than Mick Taylor on guitar (similar to the videos for &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; and &quot;Worried About You&quot; in which Harvey Mandel and Wayne Perkins respectively actually played).

==Critical reception and legacy==

Reviews for &quot;Tattoo You&quot; were largely positive, proclaiming the album a return to form and ranking among the Rolling Stones&#x27; finest works. Debra Rae Cohen commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;Just when we might finally have lost patience, the new record dances (not prances), rocks (not jives) onto the scene, and the Rolling Stones are back again, with a matter-of-fact acceptance of their continued existence – and eventual mortality …&quot;

Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;remarkably, &quot;Tattoo You&quot; is something special...None of [the tracks] are Chuck Berry retreads, none of them are disco, and none of them are reggae – they are all rock-and-roll, with more than a hint of the soul and blues influences that were so important in the band&#x27;s early work...The new album&#x27;s lyrics are also a surprise. The Stones seem to have dropped the studied decadence that was their most characteristic pose throughout the 70&#x27;s. The songs on &quot;Tattoo You&quot; seem to be by and about real people rather than larger-than-life caricatures.&quot;

Mark Moses, in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, said that the album &quot;has its moments of gratuitous star-mongering, but more often you hear the Stones shirking that stardom. ... Moody, surprisingly impassioned, the Rolling Stones, archetypal bad boys (men?), are on &quot;Tattoo You&quot; less concerned with sounding merely tough than they have been in a long while; even their stock moves seem fresh, passionate.&quot;
Robert Christgau gave the album a good review but criticised &quot;Start Me Up&quot; in his Pazz and Jop essay in 1981, saying, &quot;Its central conceit – Mick as sex machine, complete with pushbutton – explains why the album it starts up never transcends hand-tooled excellence except when Sonny Rollins, uncredited, invades the Stones&#x27; space. Though it&#x27;s as good in its way as &#x27;Street Fighting Man&#x27;, how much you care about it depends entirely on how much you care about the Stones&#x27; technical difficulties.&quot;

Patty Rose, in &quot;Musician&quot;, said, &quot;The feel of the album … is more one of rediscovered youth, of axes to play, not grind, of the latest cope, not dope. … The Stones have shed yet another layer of self-consciousness and their shiny vinyl new skin tingles with an open, early-decade kind of excitement.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Creem&quot;, Nick Tosches expressed contempt for what he felt was the Stones&#x27; gratuitous sexism and general negativity in their lyrics. After pointing out examples of what he considered misogyny in &quot;Slave&quot;, &quot;Little T+A&quot;, &quot;Hang Fire&quot; and even &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, he added: &quot;Let it never be said that the Stones have a one-track mean streak. They are capable of singing for minutes on end without spewing venom at the target sex. &#x27;Neighbours&#x27;, for example, is quite catholic in its grimacing, directed as it is towards the whole family of man, with nary a mention of race, color or creed. &#x27;No Use in Crying&#x27; contains the imperative phrase &quot;Stay away from me,&quot; addressed to no one in particular, more times than I could count...&quot;

In a 2018 retrospective for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, music critic Alexis Petridis ranked &quot;Tattoo You&quot; as the band&#x27;s thirteenth best album out of 23, stating that it &quot;has no right to be as good as it is.&quot;

===Album Cover Art===

The album cover was designed by Peter Corriston and Hubert Kretzschmar. It featured close up black and white photos of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards with tattoo illustrations on their faces. It was controversial as many people failed to recognize the cover photo to be Jagger and believed it to be an unknown female. When asked why he didn&#x27;t photograph the rest of the band, Kretzschmar explained,&quot;It was a decision that Mick and Keith must have made. I remember Charlie was at the photo shoot with both of them, no effort was made to get him to pose or be part of it.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1989, it was ranked No. 34 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 211 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then re-ranked number 213 in the 2012 revised list.

In 2000 it was voted number 759 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

Peter Corriston, who was responsible for the album cover&#x27;s concept origination, art direction and design, won a Grammy Award for &quot;Tattoo You&quot; in the category of best album package.

===Band appraisal===
In the 1995 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview during which editor Jann Wenner called &quot;Tattoo You&quot; the Stones&#x27; &quot;most underrated album&quot;, Jagger said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s excellent. But all the things I usually like, it doesn’t have. It doesn’t have any unity of purpose or place or time.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;Tattoo You&quot; was remastered and reissued in 1994 by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. It was released on SHM-SACD in 2011 by Universal Music Japan. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature elements of the original vinyl album packaging.

The 40th anniversary reissue of &quot;Tattoo You&quot; was released on 22 October 2021, with 9 unreleased tracks and a live album recorded at Wembley Stadium, London in 1982. The track &quot;Living in the Heart of Love&quot; was released on 19 August 2021.

<text>Martin Patterson Hingle (July 19, 1924 – January 3, 2009) was an American character actor who appeared in stage productions and in hundreds of television shows and feature films. His first film was &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; in 1954. He often played tough authority figures. Hingle was a close friend of Clint Eastwood and appeared in the Eastwood films &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;, &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, and &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;. He also portrayed Jim Gordon in the &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise from 1989 to 1997.

==Early life==
Born in Miami, Florida (some sources say Denver, Colorado ), Hingle was the son of a building contractor father and a mother who &quot;worked at menial jobs&quot;. He attended high school in Weslaco, Texas, and played tuba in the WHS band. During World War II, Hingle enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December 1941, dropping out of the University of Texas, and served on the destroyer USS &quot;Marshall&quot;. He returned to UT after the war and earned a degree in radio broadcasting in 1949. As a Navy reservist, he was recalled to the service during the Korean War and served on the escort destroyer USS &quot;Damato&quot;.

==Career==
Hingle began acting in college, and after graduating, he moved to New York and studied at HB Studio and the American Theatre Wing. In 1952, he became a member of the Actors Studio. This led to his first Broadway show, &quot;End as a Man&quot;.

On Broadway, Hingle performed the role of Gooper in the original Broadway production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955). He played the title role in Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s award-winning Broadway play &quot;J.B.&quot; (1958), receiving rave reviews. 

In February 1959, while playing &quot;J.B.&quot; on Broadway, Hingle was seriously injured in an accident. He was trapped in the elevator of his West End Avenue apartment building when it stalled between the second and third floors. The elevator stopped four feet above the landing, within reach, and Hingle tried to jump to the second floor. He missed and fell back down the elevator shaft, plunging 30 feet to the bottom. He fractured his skull, wrist, hip and most of the ribs on his left side. He broke his left leg in three places and lost the little finger on his left hand. 

On the strength of his performance in &quot;J.B.&quot;, Hingle had been offered the title role of the 1960 film &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, but he lost it to Burt Lancaster because of his injuries. His recovery took months, and at first he could not walk without a cane.

Hingle appeared in the 1963 Actors Studio production of &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;, directed by Jose Quintero, and &quot;That Championship Season&quot; (1972). He earned a Tony Award nomination for his performance in &quot;Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1957). In 1997, he played Benjamin Franklin in the Roundabout Theatre revival of the musical &quot;1776&quot;, with Brent Spiner and Gregg Edelman.

Hingle&#x27;s first film role was an uncredited part as bartender Jock in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954). Later in his career, he was known for playing judges, police officers and other authority figures. He was a guest star on the early NBC legal drama &quot;Justice&quot;, based on case histories of the Legal Aid Society of New York, which aired in the 1950s.

Another notable role was as the father of Warren Beatty&#x27;s character in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961). Hingle was widely known for portraying the father of Sally Field&#x27;s title character &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979). He also played manager Colonel Tom Parker in John Carpenter&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Elvis&quot; (1979).

Hingle had a long list of television and film credits to his name dating to 1948. Among them were two episodes of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1964), &quot;Carol for Another Christmas&quot; (1964), &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), &quot;&quot; (1967), &quot;The Invaders&quot; (1967), &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968), &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977), &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983), &quot;Road To Redemption&quot; (2001), &quot;When You Comin&#x27; Back, Red Ryder?&quot; (1979), &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985), Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986), &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987), &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot; (1992), &quot;Cheers&quot; (1993), &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988), &quot;Wings&quot; (1996), and &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000). He played Dr. Chapman in seven episodes of the TV series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1971), and Col. Tucker in the movie &quot;Gunsmoke: To the Last Man&quot; (1992). In 1963, Hingle guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; &quot;The Incredible World of Horace Ford&quot;, as the title character. He guest-starred in the TV series &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. In 1980, he appeared in the short-lived police series &quot;Stone&quot; with Dennis Weaver.

Hingle played Commissioner Gordon in the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot; and its three sequels. He is one of only two actors to appear in the four &quot;Batman&quot; films from 1989 to 1997; the other is Michael Gough.

In November 2007, he created the Pat Hingle Guest Artist Endowment to enable students to work with visiting professional actors at the University of North Carolina Wilmington .

==Personal life==
Hingle married Alyce Faye Dorsey on June 3, 1947. They had three children. The couple later divorced. In 1979 Hingle married Julia Wright. He and his second wife had two children. 

==Death==
Hingle died from myelodysplastic cancer (which he had been diagnosed with in November 2008) at the age of 84 at his house in Carolina Beach in North Carolina on 3 January 2009. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="475061" wikidata="Q2603219" url="?curid=475061" title="Greater Netherlands">
<text>Greater Netherlands (, ) is an irredentist concept which unites the Netherlands, Flanders, and sometimes Brussels. Additionally, a Greater Netherlands state may include the annexation of the French Westhoek, Suriname, formerly Dutch-speaking areas of Germany and France, or even the ethnically Dutch and/or Afrikaans-speaking parts of South Africa. A related proposal is the Pan-Netherlands concept, which includes Wallonia and potentially also Luxembourg.

The Greater Netherlands concept was originally developed by Pieter Geyl, who argued that the &quot;Dutch tribe&quot;, encompassing the Flemish and Dutch people, are only separated due to the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain in the 16th century. While Geyl—an outspoken anti-fascist—argued from a historical and cultural perspective, the fascist Verdinaso and Nazi movements built upon the idea of a Greater Netherlands during the 1930s and 1940s with a focus on ethnic nationalism, a concept still prominent among some on the far-right. Other 21st-century proponents of the Greater Netherlands concept include moderates in Belgium and the Netherlands who seek to elevate the Benelux ideal to a more centralized political union.

Public support for a union of Flanders and the Netherlands is relatively small, especially in Flanders, where Flemish independence is seen as the main alternative to the Belgian state.

== Economy ==

Greater Netherlands without Brussels:

Or with Brussels:

==Terminology==
The potential country is also known as Dutchland (&quot;Dietsland&quot;), which incorporates the word &quot;Diets&quot; – an archaic term for (Middle) Dutch. This label was popular until the Second World War, but its associations with collaboration (especially in Flanders) meant that modern supporters generally avoid using it. The ideology is often labeled as Greater Netherlandism (&quot;Groot-Nederlandisme&quot;). Dutch Movement (&quot;Dietse Beweging&quot;) is another term often used for the movement, while in literature it is often called the Greater Netherlands Thought (&quot;Grootnederlandse Gedachte&quot;).

Greater Netherlandism is often confused with the Orangist movement in Belgium which fought for the reunification of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after Belgian Independence. While many Orangists are Greater Netherlandists, the Orangists mainly focus on restoring Orange-Nassau&#x27;s control over the South often for legitimist reasons.

The Prince&#x27;s Flag is sometimes used by both Orangist and Greater Netherlandic groups due to its use by supporters of William I of Orange during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, who led the revolt of the Low Countries against the Spanish. During this rebellion the Dutch-speaking regions of the Low Countries, encompassing modern day Flanders and the Netherlands, banded together under the Union of Utrecht, the precursor to the modern Dutch state. The flag was also used by the Dutch Republic and United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Today the flag is generally associated with the far-right in the Netherlands.

=== Pan-Netherlands ===

&quot;Pan-Netherlands&quot; () is another term that was used for the theoretical Greater Netherlands state, but this term is now used mainly for the movement that aims to unite all of the Low Countries (Benelux) as a single multilingual entity, also including Wallonia and Luxembourg.

==History==

The first proposals to unite the Southern Netherlands with the Dutch Republic to form a greater Dutch-speaking state were made following the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. The concept was realized following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 when the Congress of Vienna established the Kingdom of the Netherlands from the territories of the former Dutch Republic and Austrian Netherlands. Following the independence of Belgium in 1830, the 1860s saw renewed Flemish interest in a united Dutch-speaking state as some Dutch-speaking Belgian citizens opposed the privileged positions held by the French-speaking bourgeoisie. By the end of the 19th century the Greater Netherlandic movement had emerged alongside the Flemish Movement in response to the subordination of the Dutch-speaking population in Belgian government and public life. &#x27;Waar Maas en Schelde vloeien&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Het Lied der Vlamingen&#x27;) is a popular Greater Netherlandic song written around this time by Peter Benoit and Emmaniel Hiel. In 1895 nationalists from both Belgian Flanders and the Netherlands created the Greater Netherlandic General Dutch Union ( (ANV)) for the purpose of stimulating cooperation between Belgian Flanders and the Netherlands, a role it continues to hold.

The German occupation of Belgium during World War I further intensified the conflict between the nation&#x27;s Walloon and Flemish communities. Seeing the linguistic division of Belgium as a means of facilitating its occupation, the Germans employed &quot;Flamenpolitik&quot; to divide the administration of Belgium between French and Dutch-speaking authorities. This resulted in a surge in the popularity of the ANV in both Flanders and the Netherlands, with a group of more radical students founding the Dutch Student Association (). Even the BWP—the first Belgian socialist party—had a considerable number of Greater Netherlandists among their ranks in Antwerp, including Maurits Naessens.

The Greater Netherlands idea gained more structure in the early 20th century. In the Netherlands, some nationalists began to see Flanders as part of a broader Dutch identity, and this perspective found sympathy in Flemish nationalist circles, where people advocated for the preservation and promotion of the Dutch language.

During World War I (1914–1918), some Flemish nationalists saw an opportunity to push their cause by collaborating with the German occupation, which had a policy of encouraging Flemish autonomy as a way to weaken Belgium. The collaboration led to the rise of radical Flemish nationalism, some of which began to promote the idea of a union with the Netherlands.

After the war, the Flemish Movement grew in Belgium, with demands for linguistic equality and greater autonomy for Flanders. While this movement was primarily focused on gaining rights within Belgium, a fringe element started advocating for full separation from Belgium and unification with the Netherlands under a &quot;Greater Netherlands.&quot;

Occupations of Belgium and the Netherlands by Nazi Germany during World War II resulted in the belief within nationalist circles that a Greater Netherlands state could be achieved through collaboration with the German occupiers. While their administration of Belgium was divided along linguistic lines in a policy similar to &quot;Flamenpolitik&quot;, the German Nazis did not seek to combine Flanders with the Netherlands. They instead sought either the establishment of a Pan-Germanist union of the ethnically Germanic Dutch speakers with Germany or a New Order in which both Belgium and the Netherlands would continue to exist as &quot;de jure&quot; independent German satellite states. The movement saw a drastic decline in popularity following the war due to its association with wartime collaborators in both countries, particularly due to the Flemish National Union (VNV) in Flanders and the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, though remains popular among some on the right of Flemish and Dutch politics.

== Political parties ==
===Belgium===
The Belgian far-right party Vlaams Belang voiced support for the idea, since they see the formation of a &quot;Federation of the Netherlands&quot; as a logical and desirable consequence of a Flemish secession from Belgium. In 2021, the leader of the Flemish Nationalist N-VA, Bart De Wever argued in Trends Talk on Kanaal Z that the next step after Belgian Confederalism should be a union of Flanders and the Netherlands, which led to a resurgence in discussions on the topic.
===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands it is on the agenda of two major political parties, the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and Forum for Democracy (FvD). On 12 May 2008, Dutch politician Geert Wilders (PVV) said in &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; that he was interested in the possibility of unifying the Netherlands and Flanders. Wilders proposed that, in accordance with previous polls, referendums should be held in the Netherlands and Flanders on the merger. He argued that he was not planning to impose unification on the Flemish, but stated that then-Dutch Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende needed to discuss the subject with his Flemish colleagues, which Balkenende refused. Thierry Baudet of the far-right Forum for Democracy also voiced support saying he &quot;welcomes&quot; Flanders in their kingdom even arguing that Flanders &quot;actually belongs to us&quot; when asked about it at a conference.

Smaller Greater-Netherlandic groups are the Dutch political party Nederlandse Volks-Unie (NVU) and the Belgo-Dutch Voorpost. Since 2018, the Greater Netherlands youth organization, the Geuzenbond, has been active in the Netherlands and Flanders. Members of this organization founded the Greater Netherlands Student Association in Leiden in 2021. A Nijmegen chapter followed in 2023.

==Opinion polling==
===Netherlands===
Although it hasn&#x27;t been a major political issue in the Netherlands for quite some time, in 2007, a poll indicated that two-thirds of the Dutch population would welcome a union with Flanders. Another poll published by RTL4 found that 77% of respondents living in the Netherlands would support a Greater Netherlands.
===Flanders/Netherlands===
In Flanders, support for the idea is less clear. A 1999 study by Jaak Billiet of the Catholic University of Leuven showed that 1 to 2% of Flemish people were in favor of the idea. Non-representative opinion polls on the internet have since proven less clear, with between 2% and 51% of respondents supporting unification with the Netherlands. While the prevailing Dutch view on unification is it being a means of territorial expansion, the Flemish have expressed fears of being culturally assimilated into the larger and more populous Netherlands.

Although, due to the difficulties experienced in the 2007 Belgian government formation and to a lesser extent during the 2019–2020 Belgian government formation and the victory of both Flemish separatist parties; New Flemish Alliance and Vlaams Belang, in those elections, the discussion on Flanders seceding from Belgium became relevant again. Neither of the separatist parties openly supports a &quot;Greater Netherlands&quot; however, presidents of both parties (Tom Van Grieken and Bart De Wever) spoke out in favour of a Greater Netherlands after Flemish independence.

<text>St John&#x27;s College is one of the recognised colleges of Durham University. The college was established in 1909 as a Church of England theological college and became a full constituent college of the university in 1919. The college consists of John&#x27;s Hall for students studying on any university course and Cranmer Hall (with its own master or warden), an Anglican theological college in the open evangelical tradition. All part time and distance learning postgraduate students reading for theology are automatically assigned to St John&#x27;s. Started as a men&#x27;s college, it was the first Church of England theological college to train men and women together, where it subsequently became mixed.

St John&#x27;s is Durham&#x27;s second smallest college only to St Chad&#x27;s. Being an independent college, St John&#x27;s is financially and constitutionally independent of the university and has a greater degree of administrative independence than the other, &quot;maintained&quot;, colleges. However, to maintain its status as a recognised college, the university council must approve the appointment of its principal and be notified of changes to its constitution.

The college has a reputation for being religious due to it being the only college in Durham authorised to train people to priesthood. The college is also strictly traditional and Johnians hold their own matriculation ceremony in their 12th-century chapel, in addition to the university wide matriculation at the Cathedral; members of St John&#x27;s are also required to wear gowns for weekly formal dinners, and still say grace in Latin. St John&#x27;s is the only college in Durham to not charge its students with laundry cleaning and made the attendance of formals free of charge. The college chapel (Church of St Mary the Less) is also the final resting place of Dame Elizabeth Bowes. She had ten children and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was descended from her third son, George Bowes.

== History ==
Founded as a Church of England theological college in 1909, the members of the initial College Council were:

The college became a full constituent college of the university in 1919. In 1958 it was divided into Cranmer Hall theological college and the non-theological John&#x27;s Hall. The halls have always held to a broadly evangelical tradition.

In 1973 St John&#x27;s became the first Durham undergraduate male college to admit female students, though Cranmer Hall had been admitting women for theological education since 1966. St John&#x27;s was the first Church of England theological college to have both a lay person and a woman as principal (Ruth Etchells).

The college has an advowson (a right to appoint clergy to a parish) over four benefices: Chester-le-Street and Stranton in the Diocese of Durham and jointly with other avowees the benefices of Doddington with Benwick and Wimblington, and St Mark with St Paul, Darlington. Previously, the patron had complete power to appoint the new priest, however that power is now exercised jointly with the local bishop and parish.

== Buildings ==
The college is formed from a number of Georgian houses on the Bailey between Durham Cathedral and the River Wear. The main house is Haughton House, named after Haughton Castle in Northumberland, the seat of the family of William Donaldson Cruddas who were early benefactors of the college and other Christian churches and charities in the north east of England. The houses which make up Cranmer Hall were once owned by the Bowes-Lyon family (the late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&#x27;s family).
The majority of the college buildings are grade II listed, with parts of 3 and 4 South Bailey grade II* listed. Before coming into the possession of St John&#x27;s, Linton House, no 1 South Bailey, was the main property of St. Chad&#x27;s College. It is said to have much earlier origins, with the frontage seen today added to an existing timber-framed building after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660.

No 2 South Bailey has distinctive circular &quot;blind&quot; windows which were revealed during a re-rendering in the 1980s. This enabled Martin Roberts, then Durham City&#x27;s conservation officer, to date the building precisely to the late 17th century.

The illogically interconnected nature of many of the college buildings regularly results in visitors becoming lost. The similarly unusual nature of college stairways, one of which disappears into a solid wall, adds an element of Escher to the architecture.

The college chapel, dedicated to St Mary and known as St Mary the Less, is of Norman origin and was rebuilt in the 1840s and re-ordered at the turn of the 21st century. It became the college chapel in 1919, before which it had been the parish church of the South Bailey. It is still a chapel of ease in the Parish of St Oswald. The chapel is also used by the local Greek Orthodox congregation.

== Student life ==
Owing to its small population, Johnians tend to know one another regardless of year, course or accommodation (all of the first years and the majority of finalists live in college; the second years are required to find their own accommodation). Elected Freshers Reps are generally well known throughout college thereby giving new Johnians more opportunities for one-on-one interaction, providing a more solid foundation in their first few weeks than in the larger colleges.

St John&#x27;s participates in a number of sports such as cross country running, mixed lacrosse, rowing, men&#x27;s football, badminton, hockey and rugby among others. St John&#x27;s College Boat Club was founded in 1910 and operates out of two boathouses on the River Wear. The college&#x27;s theatre company, Bailey Theatre Company, is ratified by Durham Student Theatre and is open to any member of the university. Their 2019 performance of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Family Circles&quot;, produced in collaboration with St. Chad&#x27;s, featured a cast and production team formed entirely from first-year students. 

Other performances include Sarah Kane&#x27;s &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; in the Epiphany term of 2009 and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; in the Michaelmas term of 2008. The company also puts on an annual Shakespeare performance after university examinations in the summer. This traditionally involves an outdoor performance on Library Lawn, though the college&#x27;s newly refurbished amphitheatre was used in 2019. In 2008, the society&#x27;s performance of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; won the Durham Student Theatre Award for Best Play.

John&#x27;s Music Society, founded in 2012, is the governing body for music within college. It regularly puts on large-scale concerts and helps students set up new musical ensembles as well as organising socials and concert trips for its members. The society is also responsible for organising popular open mic nights and the annual JMS barbecue.

<text>The Kangxi Dictionary () is a Chinese dictionary published in 1716 during the High Qing, considered from the time of its publishing until the early 20th century to be the most authoritative reference for written Chinese characters. Wanting an improvement upon earlier dictionaries, as well as to show his concern for Confucian culture and to foster standardization of the Chinese writing system, its compilation was ordered by the Kangxi Emperor in 1710, from whom the compendium gets its name. The dictionary was the largest of its kind, containing 47,043 character entries. Around 40% of them were graphical variants, while others were dead, archaic, or found only once in the Classical Chinese corpus. In today&#x27;s vernacular written Chinese, fewer than a quarter of the dictionary&#x27;s characters are commonly used.

The text is available in many forms, from Qing dynasty block print editions, to reprints using traditional Chinese bookbinding, to Western-style hardcovers including revisions and ancillary essays, to a digitized version accessible via the internet.

==Compilation==
In his preface to the 1716 printing, the emperor wrote:
::Every time I read widely in the commentaries on the classics, the pronunciations and meanings are complex and obscure, and each person protects his own explanations according to his individual view, so that it is not likely that any will communicate everything without gaps. Thus I have ordered the scholar officials to acquire all the old documents, then to arrange them and revise them.

The emperor chose the term himself—at the time not having a meaning of &#x27;dictionary&#x27;, but rather something like a &#x27;compendium&#x27; or &#x27;standard&#x27; or &#x27;model&#x27; characters, as to show their correct forms and authoritative pronunciations. The compendium was generally referred to simply as , which later became a standard Chinese word for &#x27;dictionary&#x27; in the 19th century, and used to title practically every Chinese dictionary published since then. Classical Chinese is largely morphosyllabic with very few bound morphemes, meaning that most individual characters represented independent words. As such, the compilers did not make a distinction between senses of as &#x27;characters&#x27; versus as &#x27;words&#x27;; this distinction would only begin to be clearly made during the late 19th century.

The original editors included Zhang Yushu (1642–1711), Chen Tingjing (1639–1712), and a further staff of thirty men. However, both Zhang and Chen died within a year of their appointment to the task, and the work was taken up by scholars of the Hanlin Academy. The compilation was based partly on two Ming dynasty dictionaries: the 1615 &quot;Zihui&quot; by Mei Yingzuo, and the 1627 &quot;Zhengzitong&quot; by Zhang Zilie.

The imperial edict required that the project be completed within a five-year span. As such, errors were inevitable. Although the emperor&#x27;s preface said &quot;each and every definition is given in detail and every single pronunciation is provided&quot;. The scholar-official Wang Xihou (1713–1777) criticized the &quot;Kangxi Zidian&quot; in the preface of his own dictionary. When the Qianlong Emperor—Kangxi&#x27;s grandson—was informed of this insult in 1777, he sentenced Wang&#x27;s entire family to death by the nine familial exterminations, the most extreme form of capital punishment. However, as was fairly typical in such cases with literary inquisition, the emperor commuted the sentence by pardoning all of Wang&#x27;s relatives, and his grandsons given only a procedural sentence of execution at the autumn assizes (), during which the case would be reviewed and usually spared actual execution. Wang&#x27;s own sentence would be commuted from death by a thousand cuts, to merely death by beheading. The later Daoguang Emperor appointed Wang Yinzhi (1766–1834) and a review board to compile an officially sanctioned supplement to the &quot;Kangxi Zidian&quot;, which was published in 1831 as the (), correcting 2,588 mistakes mostly found in quotations and citations.
The supplemented dictionary contains 47,035 distinct character entries, in addition to 1,995 graphical variants, giving a total of 49,030 different characters. They are grouped according to a list of 214 radicals, and further sorted by the number of additional strokes in the character. Although this particular set of 214 radicals was first used in the &quot;Zihui&quot;, they are now largely known as the Kangxi radicals, and remain popular as a method of categorizing Chinese characters.

The character entries provide definitions and pronunciations in both traditional fanqie spelling and with a modern homophone, as well as example quotations from the Chinese corpus, and lists of any variants and differing meanings. The compendium also contains rime tables with characters ordered by syllable rime classes, tones, as well as initial syllable onsets.

The missionary Walter Henry Medhurst, an early translator of the Bible into Chinese, compiled &quot;Medhurst&#x27;s Chinese and English Dictionary&quot; (1842–1843) in two volumes, with Chinese sourced from the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot;.

The dictionary is one of several used by the Ideographic Research Group for the Unicode standard.

<text>Melissa Warburg Rosenberg (formerly Endicott; born January 20, 1968), known professionally as Melissa Rivers, is an American television host and actress. She is the only child of comedian Joan Rivers and producer Edgar Rosenberg.

==Early life==
Melissa Warburg Rosenberg was born on January 20, 1968, in New York City. She is the only child of Joan Rivers and Edgar Rosenberg. She spent the majority of her childhood in Los Angeles, California. She attended the John Thomas Dye School, Marlborough School, and The Buckley School. Rivers first started dancing at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the activity at the age of 12, taking regular private lessons.

Rivers attended the University of Pennsylvania, where in 1989 she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history. During her second year of college, her father Edgar committed suicide. In 1990, she took on her mother&#x27;s stage surname, after which she became known as Melissa Rivers.

==Career==
As an actress, Rivers has had roles in television shows including &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; and &quot;The Comeback&quot;. In 1998, she also appeared in the sci-fi/comedy made-for-television movie &quot;Men in White&quot; and in the 1999 film &quot;The Big Tease&quot;, a comedy directed by Kevin Allen starring Craig Ferguson. She and her mother, Joan Rivers, portrayed themselves in the 1994 celebrity docudrama &quot;Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story&quot;.

In the early 1990s, she branched out on the pre-show red carpet, interviewing celebrities on nationally televised awards shows. Rivers, who has hosted various events and served as a producer for the E! Network, has hosted two of the channel&#x27;s highest-rated specials: &quot;Oh Baby! Melissa’s Guide to Pregnancy&quot; and &quot;Oh Toddler! Surviving the Early Years&quot; (aired in January 2002).

With her mother, she hosted fashion on the red carpet interviews for the E! cable network. In 2003, they left the red carpet pre-show on E! to accept a more lucrative deal with the TV Guide Channel valued at between $6 and $8 million. Also in 2003, she appeared on the ABC Network competitive reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She has been a regular guest on the webcast show &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot;.

In 2013, she was a co-creator and co-producer of Joan&#x27;s YouTube web series &quot;In Bed with Joan&quot;, a 15- to 30-minute show with a new video uploaded weekly in which Joan interviewed a celebrity about a wide variety of personal topics in Joan&#x27;s bed, with Melissa conducting interview questions for the last several minutes. Featured videos that have garnered the most views featured comedians Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman, and Margaret Cho, television personalities Kelly Osbourne and RuPaul, as well as YouTubers Jenna Mourey (Jenna &quot;Marbles&quot;), Grace Helbig (&quot;itsgrace&quot;) and Justine Ezarik (&quot;iJustine&quot;). Other guests included Russell Peters, Gary Busey, Rob Delaney, Gabriel Iglesias, Carmen Electra, Lance Bass, Howie Mandel, Chris Hardwick, Bill Engvall, Tom Green, Penn Jillette, Aisha Tyler, Anthony Jeselnik, Eric André, Theo Von, Nick Kroll and T.J. Miller. In 2013, Melissa and Joan were honored by the Ride of Fame and a double decker tour bus was dedicated to them.

On August 31, 2015, &quot;Fashion Police&quot; began featuring Rivers as a co-host.

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, Rivers appeared in a PETA anti-fur ad campaign, encouraging consumers to &quot;Fake It...for the Animals&#x27; Sake.&quot;

She raised $100,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, resulting from ABC&#x27;s 2006 television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! Live&quot;. On June 24, 2008, Rivers appeared on the NBC game show &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; as part of the Rivers Family Team. She and her mother first battled against the Ice-T Family Team, then went on to compete against the Raven-Symoné Family Team. They won $50,000 for their charity, Guide Dogs for the Blind.

She appeared on the NBC reality television program &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; playing for the Lili Claire Foundation. She was fired in the episode that aired April 26, 2009, after which she stormed out of the boardroom, verbally assaulted teammates Annie Duke and Brande Roderick, yelled at the production crew, and refused the obligatory exit interview. Her mother was also a contestant on that season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, and threatened to quit the show after Melissa&#x27;s firing, but remained and ultimately won the competition.

She raised $22,250 on a special celebrity edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, where all the celebrities played to raise money for the research of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Personal life==
Rivers married horse trainer John Endicott in December 1998, at New York City&#x27;s Plaza Hotel in a $3 million wedding. They divorced in 2003. She has one son from that marriage, Edgar Cooper Endicott (b. 2000) who was featured with Rivers and her mother in the reality show &quot;Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?&quot; She was in a relationship with sports coach Jason Zimmerman from 2008 to 2011.

In January 2015, Rivers filed a malpractice lawsuit against the clinic and doctors who performed surgery on her mother that caused her death.

From 2015 to 2021, Rivers was in a relationship with talent agent Mark Rousso.

In 2022 Rivers met attorney Steve Mitchel at a Didi Hirsch Mental Health and Suicide Prevention event. Rivers served as a Co-Chairman of the organization&#x27;s board of directors and Mitchel was accompanying a friend. The couple got engaged in October 2023.

In January 2025, her home was destroyed in the Palisades Fire.

<text>Tung Chung, meaning &quot;eastern stream&quot;, is an area on the northwestern coast of Lantau Island, Hong Kong. One of the most recent new towns, it was formerly a rural fishing village beside Tung Chung Bay, and along the delta and lower courses of Tung Chung River and Ma Wan Chung in the north-western coast of Lantau Island. The area was once an important defence stronghold against pirates and foreign military during the Ming and the Qing dynasties.

Developed as part of the Airport Core Programme, the North Lantau New Town is the first new town on an outlying island of Hong Kong, with the first phases built on reclaimed land to the north, east and northeast of the original Tung Chung Town. Administratively, Tung Chung is part of Islands District.
==History==
===Early times===
Since the Song dynasty between 960 and 1279 AD, there have been people living in Tung Chung. At that time, they lived on fishing and agriculture. Crabs, fishes and crops were their main productions.

This place was originally called &quot;Tung Sai Chung&quot;, when Hong Kong was still a group of fishing villages. &quot;Tung&quot; means &quot;east&quot; in Cantonese, while &quot;Sai&quot; means &quot;west&quot;. At that time, merchandising ships sailed east to the village and west to Macau.

Tung Sai Chung is one of five villages of Lantau that were resettled when the coastal restriction of the Great Clearance was lifted in 1669. The other villages are Tai O, Lo Pui O, Shek Pik and Mui Wo.
Tung Chung was already seen on Western maps beginning in 1815, sometimes with the romanization Toong-chung (see image). 

Tung Chung may be a new town, but its heritage can be seen in the form of old fishing villages. They show another façade of Tung Chung, of a village before the development of the airport and the town.

=== New town development ===
In the 1990s, Tung Chung was developed as a new town. This was undertaken as part of the Airport Core Programme, a package of development and infrastructure projects surrounding the relocation of Hong Kong&#x27;s international airport from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok, adjacent to Tung Chung. Tung Chung New Town was intended to serve as a supporting community for the new airport.

According to the information from the Hong Kong Territory Development Department, Tung Chung is being developed in four phases into a new town with a target population of 250,000 people. The first phase was completed in 1994; infrastructure works was completed in January 1997 in order to tie with the subsequent completion of the first housing developments. This phase of development provided about 20,000 people in the district to support the airport at Chek Lap Kok.

Phase 2 of Tung Chung development was also completed. About 350,000 square metres of land was reclaimed east of the Phase 1 development area. Roads and drainage works to serve this reclaimed land were completed in May 2000. Land formation of 270,000 m2 for the remaining Phase 2 areas south of Tung Chung Bay together with the associated infrastructure were completed in February 2001. Upon completion, Phase 2 development will accommodate a population of 67,000.

Reclamation works under Phase 3A development commenced in March 1999 and were completed in April 2003. About 260,000 m2 of land was reclaimed north-east of Phase I development area. The reclamation will provide land for housing developments to accommodate a population of about 22,000.

The remaining development in Tung Chung is planned to be implemented as Phases 3 and 4 and to be completed in a foreseeable future.

Currently, Tung Chung is primarily residential, but an office block and hotel have already been completed. It is envisaged that in the future, other commercial projects will be developed in Tung Chung to support the growing population.

== Housing ==
Tung Chung New Town (Phase 1) is the newly developed core living area around Tung Chung. The development is one of the ten parts of the Hong Kong Airport Core Programme. The first phase of public housing development was completed in late 1997 and can accommodate up to 15,000 people. Another 5,000 people are housed in the private housing development completed in 1998.

===Private housing estates===
Tung Chung Crescent is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package One together with Seaview Crescent and Citygate. It is the first private residential estate completed in Tung Chung. It is jointly developed by five local developers including Hang Lung Development Co. Ltd., Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd., New World Development Co. Ltd., Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., Swire Properties and with the MTR Corporation.

Seaview Crescent, developed by the same developers as Tung Chung Crescent, consists of four tower blocks in the same style of Tung Chung Crescent, though these face the sea and the airport at Chek Lap Kok.

Coastal Skyline is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Two. It was jointly developed by HKR International Limited, Hong Leong Holdings Limited and Reco Tung Chung Pte Ltd. and MTR Corporation and consisting of seven residential towers of around 50 stories each, and a number of low-rise flats.

Caribbean Coast is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Three. It was jointly developed by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, Hutchison Whampoa Limited and the MTR Corporation. It is about 67,900 m2 with both residential and commercial buildings.

The Visionary was built by Nan Fung Group, consisting of 9 buildings with 34/35 floors each, 3 duplexes, and 6 houses. It is the first estate to be built on the reclamation land of Tung Chung North-east.

Century Link developed by the Sun Hung Kai Group, consisting of 2 phases and 6 towers (27 to 29 storeys) with 3 residential blocks (2 storeys). It is the second estate to be built on the reclamation land of Tung Chung North-east after the Visionary.

=== Public housing estates ===

Public (government) housing and Home Ownership Scheme flats also make up a sizeable part of Tung Chung. The first phase of public housing development including five homeownership blocks at Yu Tung Court and three public rental housing blocks at Fu Tung Estate comprising 2,640 homeownership and 1,664 rental units. Yat Tung Estate is a newer integrated development consisting of twenty 40-story tower blocks towards the south of the town center, near the fishing village in Tung Chung Bay, complete with kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, shopping mall, car park, and transport interchange. Ying Tung Estate was built in 2018 near Ying Tung Road, which consists of four blocks: Ying Chui House, Ying Yuet House, Ying Hei House and Ying Fuk House.

==Cultural heritage and attractions==

===Tung Chung Fort===

Tung Chung Fort was built in 1817, when the Qing Government was alarmed by the rampant piracy of Cheung Po Tsai (though Cheung himself had been captured seven years earlier) and decided to intervene and thwart the opium trade and defend the coast from pirates. The Fort was declared a monument in 1979. There are 6 old muzzle-loading cannons (still intact), each resting on a cement base and the enclosures are made of granite blocks, measuring 70 by 80 meters. Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Tung Chung Fort itself went through several transformations. It was first used as a police station and then as a secondary school. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School.

===Hau Wong Temple===

Hau Wong Temple, a tiered-roof structure built in 1765, is dedicated to Yeung Hau, a loyal court official of the Song dynasty who died with its last emperor. And this temple was a place for training soldiers in the Qing dynasty. There is a stele founded in 1777, which is an important product of culture for researches about the Qing dynasty. Recently renovated, the temple features lavish interior decorations. The temple is over 200 years old. The row of miniature human figures on the eaves looks still very real to life. On the 18th of the eighth month in the lunar calendar every year, there are activities such as Chinese operas and gatherings in the open area of the temple, to celebrate the birthday of Hau Wong.

The temple is twenty minutes walking distance from the train station.

===Tin Hau Temple===
A Tin Hau Temple is located in Chek Lap Kok New Village, Wong Lung Hang Road, Tung Chung. The temple was initially built in 1823 at the north east of Chek Lap Kok. It was dismantled in 1991 because of the construction of the new airport, and was rebuilt in 1994 at its present location. It is a Grade I historic building.

===Tung Chung Battery===

Tung Chung Battery was one of the two military forts built in 1817 at the foot of the Rocky Lion Hill at Tung Chung according to the Guangdong Annals. Its remains were discovered on a hill slope facing the sea near Tung Chung pier in 1980. An L-shaped wall with a platform at the corner, probably for gun emplacements, was revealed after clearing the dense undergrowth.

===Lo Hon Temple===
, at Shek Mun Kap. Built by lay Buddhists in 1974, it occupies the site of a grotto named Lo Hon Cavern where a hermit from Guangdong practiced Buddhism in 1926.

===Ngong Ping: Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Ngong Ping 360===
Tung Chung serves as the gateway for those wishing to explore Ngong Ping&#x27;s Big Buddha, one of the world&#x27;s largest seated Buddha statues, as well as Po Lin Monastery.

Ngong Ping can be reached by:
* The Ngong Ping 360 cable car
* Buses from Tung Chung Town Centre; plying between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via Tung Chung Road and South Lantau Highway
* Hiking trail

==Nature and ecology==

Tung Chung is surrounded by two large country parks, cover an area of Lantau Island as large as Hong Kong Island: The Lantau North and Lantau South Country Parks.

The presence of mangroves and freshwater streams in Tung Chung provides excellent ecologically valuable habitats for freshwater fish species, dragonflies and rare amphibians.

However, the reclamation and other civil engineering works in Tung Chung has heavily damaged these habitats and produced irreversible damage to native wildlife and the surrounding environment.

===Tung Chung Valley===

Tung Chung Valley is the home of some of the steepest and most primeval mountain streams in Hong Kong. The formation of spectacular waterfalls is facilitated in the presence of the sheer cliffs and deep gorges in the valley.

Almost all the streams in the area have their name related to &quot;Lung&quot; (the Chinese word for &quot;dragon&quot;) which is the Chinese mythological creature of the waters and the favorite metaphor for the towering waterfalls.

As the main branch of the Tung Chung Valley, the deep-set Wong Lung Valley is the home of the Wong Lung Stream (The Yellow Dragon). The mainstream has its source on the saddle at the east of Sunset Peak, but the stream collects water through a large network of feeder streams on both sides of the valley, including the famous Tung-Lung, Pak-Lung, Chong-Lung, and Ngo-Lung Streams, which are known collectively as &quot;The Five Dragons of Tung Chung&quot;.

===Wong Lung Waterfall===
Wong Lung Waterfall is located in the Lantau North Country Park. It is named &quot;Wong-Lung&quot; since, during a heavy rainstorm, when we view from the high ground, the stream resembles a yellow dragon ready to take off for heaven when it and its feeders are flooded with torrential muddy water, with Wong-Lung as the trunk and the feeders its limbs.

===Tung Lung Stream===
The spectacular Tung Lung Stream includes what appear as continuous waterfalls of more than 700 feet (213 m). Tung Lung Stream is rich in varieties of rare local wild plants and animals, especially in the primeval forest at an upper stream, among them the unique Hong Kong newts (&quot;Paramesotriton hongkongensis&quot;) as well as several species of wild orchids.

===Tung Chung River===
Tung Chung River is the only known Hong Kong site for the rare fish, Acrossocheilus (Lissolichthys) wenchowensis beijiangensis (北江光唇魚) and one of only two sites on Lantau where the locally rare crested kingfisher, &quot;Megaceryle lugubris&quot;, has been recorded.

===Upper Tung Chung Valley===
The upper Tung Chung Valley is an important habitat for birds, including thrushes and warblers (Hopkin, pers. comm.). Eagle owls, a species highly sensitive to any disturbance around their nesting sites, breed here (Wilson, pers. comm.). The locally rare Hainan blue flycatcher probably breeds here (Chalmers, pers. comm.). The largest population of the reptile tokay gecko, &quot;Gekko gecko&quot;, occurs in the cliffs and boulder crevices in upper Tung Chung Valley (Lau, pers. comm.).

The woods in the upper Tung Chung Valley are reportedly some of the best on Lantau for rare plant species and for butterflies, including the birdwing butterfly which breeds here (Reels, pers. comm.).

===Hiking trails===
The Tung O Ancient Trail is a hiking trail that links Tung Chung to the fishing village of Tai O. This trail follows the north-western coast of Lantau Island; providing a view of the runway approach to Chek Lap Kok as well as a number of villages and local scenery. This, however is a strenuous four-hour trek.

An easier and well-wooded walk with picnic and barbecue sites also link Shui Hau to Tung Chung Road. Turning south from Tung Chung Road, visitors can get to the Cheung Sha beaches.

===Hong Kong Buddhist Youth Camp===
Located on a 4,877 m2 site near Tung Chung, the Buddhist Youth Camp was built in 1979 at a cost of HK$3 million, the camp is run by the Hong Kong Buddhist Association. Facilities available at the camp include table tennis, chess, books and television, playground for basketball, badminton, archery, barbecue and a swimming pool.

==Recreation==

In a move to encourage green transport, on the model of most of the new towns, cycle tracks run throughout the town, and are widely used. Most of the private estates provides full clubhouse facilities for their residents. In October 2010, a public library opened, behind Citygate Outlets shopping center. In April 2011, a swimming pool opened near the Ngong Ping cable car.

In the future, an indoor games hall and community centre are planned for Tung Chung. Additionally, the Hong Kong Disneyland development at Penny&#x27;s Bay will provide further recreational opportunities.

==Economy==

===Shopping and dining===

Tung Chung Town Centre features a number of shops, restaurants, a cinema and entertainment facilities centered on the Citygate development; as well as transportation to Kowloon or Hong Kong Island. The Tung Chung Citygate Outlets have many factory outlets of high-end brands and other brands as well as offering huge discounts.
Fu Tung Shopping Centre, Yat Tung Shopping Centre, and Citygate are the three shopping centres in Tung Chung thus far. Further shopping malls are expected at the new developments in Caribbean Coast. Tung Chung is 12 minutes from Tsing Yi and Kwai Tsing, where a much wider variety of shopping options are available.

Citygate Outlets is at the heart of this new town, developed in conjunction with the Tung Chung MTR station and bus terminus, thus providing a focal point to the town. Citygate, developed in the glass and steel style of the Hong Kong International Airport, contains 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) of shopping, entertainment, and food outlets spread across five floors. A square outside the mall contains a special fountain which performs a musical show regularly.

Yat Tung is a newer development; the first and second phase was completed in March 2001 and May 2002 respectively. It provides supermarkets, services, and a number of eating outlets.

Both Asian and Western cuisines are available at the many restaurants in Tung Chung, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean. It is also possible to have a meal at a temple behind the Tung Chung Battery and at a restaurant in Po Lin Monastery which serves vegetarian food.
Near the Ngong Ping cable car terminal, there are restaurants and bars offering Asian and European dishes.

In Tung Chung, the prices of everyday items are generally higher than the urban areas because of the low competition of shops in Tung Chung. Some families need their seniors to use the $2 concessions for transportation to go to more urban areas like Tsing Yi and Tsuen Wan to buy cheaper items.
