<text>The Shins is an American indie rock band formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1996. The band is the project of singer-songwriter James Mercer, who has served as the band&#x27;s sole constant member throughout numerous line-up changes. The band&#x27;s current line-up consists of Mercer, alongside Yuuki Matthews (bass, keyboards), Mark Watrous (guitar, keyboards, lap steel), Patti King (keyboards), and Jon Sortland (drums). They are based in Portland, Oregon.

The band was formed by Mercer as a side project to Flake Music, who were active from 1992 to 1999. Flake Music released two 7-inch singles and a full-length album, &quot;When You Land Here It&#x27;s Time to Return&quot;, on Omnibus Records and were touring with Modest Mouse when the Shins became signed to Sub Pop Records. The Shins&#x27; first two records, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; (2001) and &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; (2003), performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single &quot;New Slang&quot; brought the band to mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film &quot;Garden State&quot;. Consequently, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Wincing the Night Away&quot; (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and earning a Grammy Award nomination. 

Following this, the Shins signed to Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it &quot;an aesthetic decision&quot;. Following a near five-year hiatus, &quot;Port of Morrow&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released in 2012. Their fifth album, &quot;Heartworms&quot;, was released in March 2017.

==History==

===Early years (1996–2000)===

The Shins was formed in 1996 by James Mercer, a member of the band Flake Music in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Flake Music (formerly known simply as Flake) consisted of members guitarist/vocalist James Mercer, drummer Jesse Sandoval, keyboardist Martin Crandall, and bassist Neal Langford. The group began in 1992 and released a string of singles and an album, &quot;When You Land Here, It&#x27;s Time to Return&quot;, which was well received. The band toured with Modest Mouse and Califone. Mercer formed the Shins for a change of pace and enlisted Sandoval on drums. When asked what it was that began his interest in music, Mercer said &quot;... it got me out of my shell and gave me a social life.&quot; They began performing as a duo alongside Cibo Matto and the American Analog Set. Mercer became the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, and consequently, &quot;the group developed a more focused, crafted sound than Flake Music&#x27;s charming, if somewhat rambling, collaborative style.&quot; His focus on percussive guitar playing still led friends to compare his demos as too similar to Flake, and he focused on taking the music in a different direction. Unlike Flake, Mercer was the band&#x27;s sole lyricist, and songs were built from his initial structure. The group added Scared of Chaka&#x27;s Dave Hernandez and Ron Skrasek to complete their lineup, but the two musicians left before the end of the decade to pursue their work with Scared of Chaka. By 1999, Flake Music disbanded and Neal Langford joined the Shins.

The Shins issued their first release — the 7&quot; single &quot;Nature Bears a Vacuum&quot; — in 1998 via Omnibus Records. Following the completion of their debut single release, &quot;When I Goose-Step&quot;, the Shins embarked on a tour with Modest Mouse. Mercer became a &quot;hermit&quot; crafting what would become the group&#x27;s debut album, and became depressed with his life in Albuquerque. Friends of the band, including Zeke Howard from Love As Laughter and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse sent record labels cassette demos of the band&#x27;s songs. Mercer sent a demo to Sub Pop Records in Seattle, Washington, and label co-founder Jonathan Poneman caught a concert in San Francisco while the band was on tour with Modest Mouse. He offered the band a one-off single deal, and the Shins&#x27; second single, &quot;New Slang&quot;, was included as part of their Single-of-the-Month series, issuing a 7&quot; single to fan club members in February 2001. Positive press for &quot;New Slang&quot; made the group&#x27;s debut album one of the most anticipated indie rock albums of 2001, and Sub Pop signed the band in full. &quot;Before you knew it, my whole life was upside down: I got signed, I quit my job, I moved out of town, the big relationship I&#x27;d had for five years ended. All of a sudden my whole life was up in smoke&quot;, recalled Mercer.

===Debut and growing popularity (2001–03)===
The band&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; (2001), was released in June 2001, with a compact disc version following the next month. Much of the album was recorded prior to the Sub Pop deal in Mercer&#x27;s basement. The album received critical acclaim and solidified the band as one of indie rock&#x27;s definitive artists, while also placing Albuquerque on the musical map with &quot;Oh, Inverted World&#x27;s&quot; &quot;gloriously skewed pop and [how it is] dripping with yearning, whimsy and brittle innocence.&quot; The album helped re-establish Sub Pop Records as a dominant force in the independent community; the label had been without a marquee artist for many of the prior years. The group spent the rest of the year touring with acts such as Preston School of Industry and Red House Painters. &quot;New Slang&quot; proved to be a &quot;stealth hit&quot;, helping &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; move over 100,000 copies within two years, considered remarkable for an independent label; Sub Pop had hoped the record would sell 10,000 copies. Mercer was positive in licensing the song to a variety of media, confirming to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he received more money from touring and licensing than record sales. The song was featured in a McDonald&#x27;s advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics, which led to criticism from several corners, among those independent music fans and the band&#x27;s own hometown alt weekly.

The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where the group built a basement studio and recorded their second album, &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; (2003). During this period, the group replaced Langford on bass with Dave Hernandez (from Scared of Chaka). Having cut ties with a bad relationship and a bad job, Mercer felt his songwriting reflected a broader perspective as a result. Although recording in the basement was less than pleasant, the band found it &quot;cheaper than a real studio&quot;. The home was broken into at one point, and thieves stole the master tapes for &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;. The album was released in October 2003 to critical acclaim, appearing on numerous music critics&#x27; and publications&#x27; end-of-year albums lists. It also became their first album to chart, peaking at number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Mainstream success (2004–07)===

&quot;New Slang&quot; was repurposed when it was prominently featured in the film &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004). In a scene from the film, Sam (portrayed by Natalie Portman) tells Andrew Largeman (played by director Zach Braff) that the song &quot;will change your life.&quot; The song &quot;changed everything&quot; for the group, causing their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had sold prior to the film&#x27;s debut. &quot;Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons,&quot; wrote Robert Levine of &quot;Spin&quot;. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. &quot;We saw a change in our audience. By the time we were done touring for &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot;, there was this new interest&quot;, said Mercer. &quot;We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses. We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them. I mean, it just kept growing!&quot; This additional exposure helped &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; move 500,000 units in the United States. Fans of the group had mixed reactions at their newfound success; some regarded their unknown nature as an integral part of their appeal. The band also appeared in season four, episode 17 of Gilmore Girls while Rory and Paris are on spring break in Florida.

Mercer began writing the band&#x27;s third record in late 2005, employing ideas and riff fragments collected over the band&#x27;s various tours. Suffering from insomnia, he would often wake up in the middle of the night and piece together songs in his home studio until dawn. For their third album, the group for the first time turned to an outside producer: Joe Chiccarelli, who produced Frank Zappa. Inspired primarily by a painful breakup and the group&#x27;s newfound success, the album was initially set to be released in the summer of 2006. It was later pushed back to fall, and finally released in January 2007. &quot;Wincing the Night Away&quot; represented a major jump for the Shins in terms of commercial success: the album peaked at number two (in comparison to its predecessors&#x27; peak of number 86), setting a record for Sub Pop. It moved over 100,000 copies in its opening week, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album. Following the success of the album, The Shins left their longtime label, Sub Pop, for Mercer&#x27;s own label, Aural Apothecary.

===Hiatus and one-man band (2008–13)===

Having worked on The Shins for nearly a decade, Mercer felt exhausted and ready to quit the band. &quot;Mainly I was tired of being right in the middle and everything sort of revolving around me, including the friendship dynamics-slash-bandmate dynamics and the creative aspect&quot;, Mercer explained in 2012. Noting that the band had never been bigger, some aspects of the limelight made him uncomfortable. Mercer was approached by Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) around this same period regarding a possible collaboration on a new project, which became Broken Bells. Enjoying the fresh approach with Broken Bells in regard to meeting new musicians, Mercer desired to continue that feeling. Mercer parted ways with longtime bandmates Dave Hernandez, Martin Crandall and Jesse Sandoval, terming it &quot;an aesthetic decision&quot;. Sandoval instead told &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot; he was &quot;unequivocally fired&quot; from the group by Mercer. Mercer would later relate that his decision was &quot;tremendously difficult&quot;, but instead wished to view it as a new phase.

Working with Burton on Broken Bells helped Mercer overcome fears of collaboration, which in turn influenced the rotating &quot;cast of characters&quot; that grouped together around him to record &quot;Port of Morrow&quot;, which became the Shins&#x27; fourth album upon its March 2012 release. Mercer returned to The Shins as the only original member. &quot;I always loved these auteurs who presented themselves as bands&quot;, Mercer later explained, referencing Neutral Milk Hotel and Lilys as examples, which led to him feeling as though he could pursue something similar, allowing the concept of The Shins to carry on. Producer Greg Kurstin had a particular influence on &quot;Port of Morrow&quot;, encouraging Mercer to experiment in the studio. Mercer began touring with an all new backing band, including fellow songwriters Jessica Dobson and Richard Swift, Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer, and Yuuki Matthews from the Crystal Skulls. &quot;Port of Morrow&quot; debuted at number three on US charts, and lead single &quot;Simple Song&quot; represented the band&#x27;s best chart performance, peaking within the top 10 on the Alternative Songs chart.

===Recent events (2014–present)===

In 2014, The Shins recorded and released a new song, &quot;So Now What&quot;, for the soundtrack of &quot;Wish I Was Here&quot; (directed by Zach Braff of &quot;Garden State&quot;). Mercer noted to &quot;Billboard&quot; that he was immensely proud of how the track came out: &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; That November, a reissue of Flake Music&#x27;s first album, &quot;When You Land Here It&#x27;s Time to Return&quot;, was released.

In 2016, the group recorded a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The Word&quot; for the Netflix show &quot;Beat Bugs&quot;. During this time, Mercer was at work on the band&#x27;s fifth album, which he felt was closer in sound to the Shins&#x27; earlier work than &quot;Port of Morrow&quot;: &quot;I made a concerted effort on certain songs to fit the palette, to use the palette that I&#x27;ve used historically for the band.&quot; The group announced their new album, &quot;Heartworms&quot;, in January; it was released on March 10, 2017. In January 2018, they released &quot;The Worm&#x27;s Heart,&quot; an album which reimagined their previous album &quot;Heartworms&quot;.

Former band member Swift died on July 3, 2018. He was admitted to the hospital in June for hepatitis.

On September 24, 2020, the band released a new single titled &quot;The Great Divide&quot;.

In April 2021, a 20th anniversary reissue of &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; was announced for release on June 11, 2021. The reissue was remastered by Bob Ludwig, with Mercer serving as an assistant. A &quot;21st birthday&quot; tour of North America was announced in May 2022, where The Shins played &quot;Oh Inverted World&quot; in its entirety.

Former bassist Neal Langford, who played on &quot;Oh Inverted World&quot; and in Flake Music with Mercer, died on July 21, 2023, at the age of 50. Mercer announced his death on July 27, describing him in a post to social media as &quot;one of the best friends I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Mercer described the Shins as a &quot;pop project&quot; from the beginning. The group were inspired by any and all music that they discovered. &quot;Everything we listen to [...] makes its way in somehow, but we&#x27;ve been inspired by a bunch of bands who basically just keep reinventing the same thing&quot;, said Mercer. The group received comparisons to the &quot;pop revivalists&quot; at the Elephant 6 Recording Collective early in their career, such as The Apples in Stereo, whilst Mercer&#x27;s vivid, often surrealist lyrics and infectious melodies drew comparisons to the songwriting style of Robert Pollard from Guided by Voices. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited the band with bringing &quot;the pop traditions of 1960s pop bands—groups like the Zombies, and the Beach Boys—to a new generation of music fans.&quot;

<text>The 2004 North Carolina gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004. The general election was between the Democratic incumbent Mike Easley and the Republican nominee Patrick J. Ballantine. Easley won by 56% to 43%, winning his second term as governor.

==Primaries==
===Democratic===
Mike Easley was first elected as governor in 2000 and opted to run for a second term. He faced opposition in the Democratic primary from Rickey Kipfer, a former corporate manager from Lee County. Kipfer campaigned on a platform of abolishing North Carolina&#x27;s personal income tax and exploring potential natural gas resources in the state. He envisioned the state replacing income tax revenue with revenue from natural gas exploration. Kipfer also proposed a system similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund as a means of distributing potential natural gas revenues to citizens in North Carolina.

Easley&#x27;s campaign manager stated that they did not consider Kipfer as serious competition. Easley did not campaign against Kipfer.

Mike Easley won the primary comfortably with over 85% of the vote.

<doc id="479770" wikidata="Q1863081" url="?curid=479770" title="Correction tape">
<text>Correction tape is an alternative to correction fluid used to correct mistakes during typing, or, in some forms, handwriting. One side of the tape, which is placed against the area to cover, is coated in a white, opaque masking material. Pressure applied to the other side of the tape transfers this material to the paper. Unlike correction fluid, the covered area can be written on it immediately after applying. As it is solid, correction tape is not subject to misuse as an inhalant, unlike most correction fluids.

== Types ==
Correction tape is sold in short spools for hand use, or as long rolls to be used in typewriters, which apply sudden pressure when a key is struck, and can therefore apply the masking material in exactly the same shape and position as the erroneous character. Some versions of correction tape are sold in separate dispensers that are used to roll the tape onto paper directly, sometimes known as a correction mouse.

The correction tapes can come in different variety of colours and designs in the current market. The materials of the tapes also varies, from having a paper-based tape that breaks easily to polyester film-based tapes that is more durable. The mechanism of the tapes differs too; the gear or the belt mechanism.

<doc id="479771" wikidata="Q1779530" url="?curid=479771" title="Correction fluid">
<text>A correction fluid (or correction liquid) is an opaque, usually white fluid applied to paper to mask errors in text. Once dried, it can be handwritten or handdrawn upon. It is typically packaged in small bottles, with lids attached to brushes (or triangular pieces of foam) that dip into the fluid. The brush applies the fluid to the paper.

Before the invention of word processors, correction fluid greatly facilitated the production of typewritten documents. One of the first forms of correction fluid was invented in 1956 by American secretary Bette Nesmith Graham, founder of Liquid Paper. With the advent of colored paper stocks for office use, manufacturers began producing their fluids in various matching colors, particularly reds, blues and yellows.

== Composition ==
The exact composition of correction fluid varies between manufacturers, but most fluids are composed of an &quot;opacifying agent&quot;, a &quot;solvent&quot; (or thinner) and an adulterant &#x27;fragrance&#x27; to discourage abuse. The opacifying agent can be composed of a mixture of titanium dioxide, latex, and other polymer resins.

Thinner originally contained toluene, which was banned due to its toxicity. Later, it contained 1,1,1-trichloroethane, a skin irritant now widely banned under the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, and then the slightly safer trichloroethylene. Thinners currently used with correction fluid include bromopropane. Because it contains organic solvents (volatile organic compounds), unused correction fluid thickens over time as volatile solvents escape into the air. It can become too thick to use, and sometimes completely solidifies. Therefore, some manufacturers also sell bottles of solvent as &quot;thinner&quot;, a few drops of which will return the correction fluid to its original liquid state. To avoid the inconveniences of organic solvents (safety and availability), some brands of fluid are water-based. However, those have the disadvantages of a longer drying time, and incompatibility with some inks (which will soak through ).

== Manufacture ==

Stainless steel tanks are used to hold or more. Specialists must consider the mixer and temperature control system carefully, and also the formula instructions, the correct types, and the amounts of raw materials at specified times by using computer controls. This process consists of 3 methods: firstly, compounding the batch; secondly, quality control check; and thirdly, filling and packing.

In the first phase, water will be filled into the main batch tank. The suspending agents and some of the ingredients will be added in this phase. Mixing is implemented at low rate for adequate dispersion. During the mixing, there is no air added into the mixture. In the second phase, pigment is in the process. It will be added in suitable amount into the water. Mixing is implemented at very high rate in this process which is different from the first phase. In the mixing process, when the particle is small enough, it will be added into the main batch. In the final phase, the resin and other necessary ingredients will be added such as colorants and preservatives.

In the process of checking the quality, specialists will check in the lab for physical and chemical characteristics such as pH determination, viscosity checks, appearance and odor evaluations. In case of mistake such as the ingredients are not enough for making correction fluid, this problem will be solved by adding more ingredients. When this process is finished, the correction fluid will be pumped to a holding tank waiting for filling the correction fluid in the next method.

Firstly, the filling process depends on the different package of each product. The filling line and the filling heads holding play a vital role in this process. The empty bottles will be in the conveyor belt and move continuously waiting for injecting correction fluid in each bottle. Secondly, when the filling process is finished, it comes to the packing process. All the filled bottles will be moved to the capping machine to sort the caps and tighten them. Finally, these bottles will be put into the box for shipping to the sellers and customers.

== Marketing ==

Correction fluid is commonly referred to by the leading brand names as genericized. These brands include:

* Cello (Correct-X)
* Kores
* Liquid Paper
* Presto! by Pentel
* Snopake
* Tipp-Ex
* Wite-Out

== Health issues ==

Organic solvents are psychoactive when sufficient amounts are inhaled. Such solvents are common inhalants for adolescents due, in part, to the fact that they are inexpensive in comparison to other recreational drugs. Use of correction fluid as an inhalant can cause the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly, which can cause death. An unpleasant smell is added to some brands in order to deter abusers.

Companies have worked closely with authorities in order to ensure that all the warnings are duly mentioned on packaging (card and product labels) to inform parents and younger users of the risks associated with inhaling or drinking the fluid.

India has imposed a ban on the retail sale of bottled nail polish remover and bottled correction fluid, but permits its sale in devices that provide a small amount of the chemical in a container that dispenses it in a controlled way. The Ministry of Education also banned its use in schools in 2017. The manufacturer is required to affix a warning regarding the possible adverse effects on health if the material is inhaled.

<doc id="479772" wikidata="Q1035935" url="?curid=479772" title="Careware">
<text>Careware (also called charityware, helpware, or goodware) is software licensed in a way that benefits a charity. Some careware is distributed free, and the author suggests that some payment be made to either a nominated charity, or a charity of the user&#x27;s choice. Commercial careware, on the other hand, includes a levy for charity on top of the distribution charge. Careware can also involve a barter of some kind, or even a pledge to be kind to strangers.

==Overview==
The term &quot;charityware&quot; was credited to Canadian developer Roedy Green in a 1988 issue of 2600 Magazine. One of the first known uses of the term &quot;careware&quot; appeared in Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal in Al Stevens&#x27; C Programming Column in about 1991. Stevens was developing a user interface library and publishing the source code in monthly installments. To distribute code to readers, Stevens suggested they send him an addressed stamped mailer with a blank diskette. He copied the code onto the diskette and returned it. He also suggested that to express their appreciation they include a dollar, which he would donate to the local food bank in Brevard County, Florida. Stevens named this distribution method &quot;careware.&quot;

Paul Lutus&#x27;s careware idea involves no monetary exchange - instead it involves a request for the user to &quot;stop complaining for a while and make the world a better place.&quot;

For example, the vim text editor is free software but includes a request from its author, Bram Moolenaar, that users donate to ICCF Holland for work to help AIDS victims in Uganda. Vim&#x27;s Charityware license has been declared by Richard Stallman to be GPL-compatible. Another current example is MJ&#x27;s CD Archiver, a file archiver for Microsoft Windows/Linux/Mac OS X. The suggested charity is NACEF, a US-registered charity for China&#x27;s Project Hope.

A close variation of careware is donationware, which has a narrower definition than careware.

<text>The Corean Chronicles is a fantasy series of books by the author L. E. Modesitt, Jr. As of 2011, it consists of:

*&quot; Legacies&quot; (2002)
*&quot;Darknesses&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Scepters&quot; (2004)
*&quot;Alector&#x27;s Choice&quot; (2005)
*&quot;Cadmian&#x27;s Choice&quot; (2006)
*&quot;Soarer&#x27;s Choice&quot; (2006)
*&quot;The Lord-Protector&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2008)
*&quot;Lady-Protector&quot; (2011)

==Plot and background==

The current books in the series comprise two trilogies in different time frames of the same world, with significant ties to each other. The first three books are set in a time frame roughly a thousand years after the events in the later three books.

The first trilogy introduces the world of Corus as a world that used to be ruled by a great civilization, that spanned the entire continent. However, a magical disaster caused its fall, ending a golden age. In the books, Corus is full of countries fighting for superiority, humans struggling to survive, and strange animals that are a product of and dependent on the life force-derived magic of the world. Additionally, there are rarely seen creatures – Soarers and Sanders – that are entities of pure life force. The fall of the civilization caused much to have been forgotten, but some few of the people of Corus still command magical powers, referred to as Talent. With that power comes the cost of having the lords of the world trying to gain influence over and control of Talent wielders. Among the denizens of Corus, these special features of the world are commonly referred to with phrases such as Talent magic, Talent wielders, and Talent creatures, among others.

The second trilogy, returning to the era of the lost civilization, introduces the civilization&#x27;s caretaker minority, the Alectors, who are human-like entities that exist on Corus, &quot;linked&quot; to their former worlds with pure life-force. While the first trilogy portrays these beings as evil – for indeed they are not natives of Corus – the later books portray the Alectors through their own point of view. Paradoxically, humans are not native to Corus either. (They are ancient genetic creations of the Alectors.) The Alectors consider regular humans (commonly referred to as steers, Landers, Indigens) inferior. Alectors are by nature, Talent wielders. Fusing their powers with technical knowledge, they are the ones that have created the infrastructure and glory of civilization that is later lost.

Place names are used frequently and complexly, however, a full map of Corus is included in each book – readers are advised to check it often.

===&quot;Legacies&quot;===
&quot;Legacies&quot; begins during the childhood of the main character, Alucius. His father is killed in action while serving in the Militia, leaving his grandparents and mother to raise him on the family Nightsheep farm in the small country of The Iron Valleys. When older, he himself is conscripted into the Militia to fight off the impending invasion by the western super-power, Madrien. During a pitched battle, he is captured and enslaved into the armies of the monarch of Madrien, the Material. After many months of combat against other nations, he discovers how to free himself from the magical collars that control the slave armies, and frees a company of others who then flee back to the Iron Valleys, and freedom.

==Parallels to &quot;The Saga of Recluce&quot;==

The &quot;Corean Chronicles&quot; deal with many of the same issues as &quot;The Saga of Recluce&quot;, in a similarly detailed world. There are small differences in how the magic works with a less clearly defined good and evil magic. Also, wild nature magic has become a strong component.

==The Alectors==
On Acorus, the Duarchs, a pair of joint rulers, oversee the remaining Alectors from their seats of power in the cities of Elcien and Ludar. The Duarchs report only to the Archon, the ruler of all Alectors, who resides on whichever planet houses the Master Scepter, a mechanism on which most Alector technology depends. At the time of these stories, both the Archon and the Master Scepter reside on Ifryn. Because they have equal power and because their superior is so far away, the Duarchs intrigue against each other, co-opting various lesser Alectors into these schemes. Strict rules govern what Alectors may do, and the punishment for violating these rules is generally death (with the offender&#x27;s life force painfully stripped from him by a scourge-like device). For this reason, the schemes are complex, designed to maximize advantage while minimizing actions likely to require overt response. Within this framework, accidents, usually fatal, occur regularly. Generally speaking, such struggles violate the tenets of &quot;The Views of the Highest&quot; a set of teachings that forms the basis of the Alectors&#x27; ethical framework. As a framework, it contains many ideas derived from sound ethics, but places the Alectors firmly in a stewardship role over their subjects, in some sense like the attitudes of Victorian England.

When a world has a sufficiency of life-force, Alectors transfer to it in larger numbers. Their activities generally overwhelm the world&#x27;s ability to sustain them, and they eventually drain the world entirely. For this reason, among the projects Alectors normally launch from a new world is the location and establishment of their presence on yet another world (or worlds) to which they can move when they must. As of this story, the world of Ifryn has established two such colonies – Acorus, and a rival Efra.

Individuals of the subject races (steers) occasionally manifest Talent. The Alectors are jealous of their supposed monopoly on this array of powers, and usually destroy any steer who demonstrates signs of Talent. Steers that survive do so either because no Alector notices them, because they are powerful enough to destroy Alectors that attempt to destroy them (very rare), or because they are employed in some Alector plot or other. Involvement in Alector machinations, either willingly or otherwise, generally only delays destruction. Even if the steer&#x27;s faction wins, when he is no longer useful the Alectors of his faction will destroy him. The most powerful steers can rival an Alector in Talent, but usually lack formal training and are therefore generally overmatched. Among steers, Talent is at least partially heritable.

==The Ancients==
Acorus was once inhabited by a race variously called the Ancients or the Soarers. They are wispy, fairy-like creatures usually surrounded by an amber-green glow (generally visible only to the Talented), the Soarers are few in number and appear only infrequently. They also live off the life force of Acorus, so the Alectors&#x27; activities threaten their survival. They oppose the Alectors within the limits of their numbers and their powers, but the use of their powers, and corresponding use of the Alectors&#x27; powers in opposition, simply makes the situation worse. Their species is actually made up of two very dissimilar &quot;genders&quot; the intelligent, talented but weak Soarers, and the strong but unintelligent Sanders that have the ability to drain life force.

Certain Alectors can link themselves directly to the world where they reside. This process disconnects them from the Master Scepter and the network of Tables, changes the nature of their Talent, and even appearance. Most other Alectors regard such individuals as little better than talented steers, but they can survive massive disruptions of the Table network that kill Alectors still connected to the Master Scepter through it.

==Powers of the Talented==
All Alectors and a few of their subjects (landers, or steers) possess a psionic potential called Talent. The degree of Talent varies among individuals. Alectors receive formal training in the use of their Talent, to the limits of their ability. Talent occasionally strengthens in later life. Specific noted powers include:

===Detection of Talent===
Everyone with Talent can generally see Talent in other objects. The ability manifests as a perceived glow or aura surrounding the object. The color represents the nature of the talent. Talent mechanisms generally produce a black or silver glow, while individuals glow according to the nature of their talent and the power of it. The natives of Acorus, called Ancients, have a yellowish-green aura, while many Alectors have a purplish-pink aura, and talented steers have a deeper green aura shading to black. The Talented can often sense whether someone is truthful, and can sometimes read an individual&#x27;s emotional state. Individuals whose auras bear reddish streaks usually cause trouble sooner or later; they lack control of their baser impulses.

Talent probes, essentially &quot;feelers&quot; or tendrils of invisible Talent can be used to examine areas beyond normal Talent detection, to manipulate the life force energy embedded or contained in objects, or to draw upon Talent energy from an open source, such as a Table or a ley line.

===Empathic Projection===
Alectors and talented steers can use their talent to project feelings to help in the persuasion or domination of others. This ability sees much use by both Alectors and talented steers to help them reassure, persuade or command usually less-Talented others. Rarely, it has been used to try to force another to perform an action against their will.

===Shields===
Alectors, and occasionally powerful landers, can form defensive shields that can block detection of their Talent (except at close range) and feelings, turn aside hostile physical and Talent attacks, create barriers to prevent the movement of others or even crush them. Usually a more powerful individual can eventually pierce such shields, but as this is time-consuming and exhausting, it may leave the attacker vulnerable to counter-attack from other sources.

===Piercing===
Somewhat related to shields, some Alectors can form what they see as points or wedges of Talent, and can direct these against the shields of another Alector in advance of or as part of an attack. This amounts to a Talent vs. Talent competition; the individual whose Talent shields are weaker loses.

===Invisibility===
Highly Talented Alectors can bend light around themselves, producing a form of invisibility. Others with Talent and training can detect them if they have reason to suspect their presence, but do not do so automatically.

===Talent locks===
A Talent lock employs life force to create a secure condition on a door or container. Safe passage requires removal of such a lock by a similarly Talented individual (who normally replaces it).

===Infuse life-force===
Alectors with the aptitude and training become Engineers, and they can infuse life force into crystals of various sorts. These crystals form the basis of Alector technology, and extend what may be done with Talent. Objects infused with life-force are exceptionally durable (lasting for thousands of years), but they draw on the life-force base of the world in small measure, limiting the quantity that may be safely produced. For this reasons, only the structures and property of the Alectors are generally so treated.

===Aiming===
Extremely Talented landers seem able to use their Talent to &quot;will&quot; projectiles such as bullets or Talent energy to strike their target. Such projectiles are normally far more accurate. In addition, they can be imbued with a &quot;charge&quot; of life force that can disrupt the life force of the target and pierce Talent shields. Alectors hit by such bullets may be severely injured or (more often) killed immediately. Wild translations, the unfortunate result of using certain Alector technology incorrectly, also die when hit by such bullets; they contain more life-force and usually explode or immolate when they die.

===Wild translations===
Interplanetary travel, as from Ifryn to Acorus, carries additional hazards. If too few attempt it, the translation corridors become balky, so that only those of great Talent can pass. If too many attempt it, the corridors become porous, occasionally decanting travelers midway to their destination, a fatal mishap. Even with the corridor operating properly, individuals may fail to translate correctly, due to weakness of Talent, accident, or sabotage. These unfortunates become Wild Translations, creatures tied directly to life-force and usually of some monstrous form of another. Alectors commonly seek out and destroy such creatures when they appear, for they are very dangerous. Wild translations often appear in the vicinity of a table, but can appear miles away. A Talented individual can sometimes sense a change before a Wild Translation materializes. Occasionally, the life-force of an individual splits into several creatures, when this happens, all appear at once. Wild translations are not intelligent.

===Shadow-matching===
Alectors with very important responsibilities are shadow-matched to hierarchically superior Alectors. For example, the Duarchs of a colony are shadow-matched to the Archon who rules all Alectors. Shadow-matching prevents the matched individual from disobeying orders and compels him to act in the best interests of another individual, even to the point of being unable to consider ideas that conflict with these interests. The shadow-matched individual retains free will in other areas, and is aware of the constraints on his behavior. A shadow-matched individual may possess additional reserves of talent tied to the shadow-match conditions; anything that breaks these conditions generally dissipates this reserve. The example contained in the stories is that of the Duarches, dual rulers of Acorus. These men possessed enormous reserves of Talent, but when they learned that the Master Scepter would go to Efra and not to Acorus, their shadow-match conditioning broke, and their reserves of Talent dissipated. This event weakened the rulers considerably, and strengthened lesser but ambitions Alectors seeking power for themselves.

===Soaring===
The Ancients were also called &quot;Soarers&quot; for their common appearance in the air.
When connected to the world life force web, especially the ley lines, talented humans such as Alucius (&quot;Scepters&quot;) and Mykella (&quot;Lady-Protector&quot;) could also soar (levitate).

==Alector technology==
Most Alector technology revolves around the artificial manipulation of life force, sometimes referred to as Talent energy. At least one Alector Engineer makes comments strongly suggesting that Alector technology has been in slow decline for thousands of years.

===The Master Scepter===
The Master Scepter ties all Alectors to their world. Even Alectors born on other worlds are tied through the Master Scepter. This link grants Alectors greatly increased lifespans, the ability to manipulate Talent to various degrees, and changes their appearance – Alectors on other worlds are very pale skinned and have very dark hair. (Hair and skin color are recurring distinguishing characteristics in Modesitt novels). These Alectors are also quite tall, and their physical height is often proportionate to their Talent energy. The Duarchs and Archon, the most Talented Alectors, are around three meters (ten feet) tall. Alectors linked to the Master Scepter, but existing on other worlds disintegrate when they die, leaving behind little beyond a fine ash.
When a world which hosts the Master Scepter is exhausted of most life force (to the point that it cannot support Alectors), the Archon, leader of the Alectors, moves the Master Scepter to a new world. Modesitt does not discuss the specifics of this process, but it creates instability in the Table networks, causing tables to release energies that kill those nearby.

===The Dual Scepters===
The Dual Scepters form part of the power network on Acorus. Modesitt implies that these powerful devices are closely connected to the Master Scepter, and are the first devices Alectors bring to a new world. They form the basis of the Table network. Individuals, such as Engineers, with sufficient training and skill may exploit the scepters to create other effects. The matriarchy of Madrien, in the later books, employed one of the scepters to project a kind of gem through which every male soldier could be killed or tortured. Male soldiers wore a collar controlled by their superiors that could interfere with their life force; all of these collars were connected to the gem and the scepter.

===Tables===
Early in their rule, Talented Alector engineers establish a network of tables. These black slabs, composed of many small energy storage crystals, establish a grid. The relative geometry of table placement affects the stability of such a grid, which somewhat limits table placement. Once established, Tables may not be removed or moved. Attempts to tamper with them generally cause Talent explosions, which are normally fatal for those in the vicinity. The planet of Acorus possesses a web, or mesh, of life force lines (compare to ley lines) that intersect in various places. Places where three or more such intersections occur are suitable locations for Tables, since they draw on this life force parasitically.

Talented individuals may employ a Table to travel to any other Table within a few seconds. During the travel interval the traveler perceives a series of tubes or conduits with colored markers. Each color designates a destination. Talent and skill partially control this; it is possible for a more Talented Alector to leave later and arrive earlier than a less talented Alector.

A subclass of Alectors known as Recorders of Deeds maintain and operate the Tables. They know the secrets of their operation, and generally do not share these with anyone outside their profession (but there have been exceptions {Dainyl} ). Talented individuals trained by Recorders can learn to perceive the psionic mechanisms that operate the Tables; using these controls, the Table may be employed to scan other parts of Acorus (even into the recent past) and may be temporarily or permanently deactivated. Recorders may also create &quot;limbs&quot; of Talent that they may use to attack others, but care is important, for any error may cause a Talent explosion. Recorders can also monitor the network, the operating status of other tables and of the grid, and can usually discern who is traveling and when they will arrive. It is very difficult to damage a Table (they have survived the complete collapse of the building housing them), but the effects of doing so are usually catastrophic. If sufficient Tables fail, the entire grid can collapse, so Alectors usually investigate and correct Table problems quickly.

===Eternastone/Life Force imbued materials===
Alectors could bind life force into various materials. Such materials possessed great durability (lasting in some cases thousands of years after the end of the Alector occupation). Eternastone, a building material used for roads and official buildings, is one example of this. Alector garments so treated could turn aside bullets (doubtless such garments were created so that Alectors might permit their Cadmians – armed forces recruited from locals – to have firearms).

===Light sources===
Alector residences and official buildings were commonly lit by steady burning torches that exploited small amounts of life force to create light. Although not particularly greedy of life force, such devices were reserved to Alectors only, at least during the earliest portions of their reign.

===Talent creatures===
Alectors have, or had, the ability to create life from life force. At the time of their occupation of Acorus, they seem limited in the forms available: there are Sandoxen, large beasts of burden, and Pteridons, reptilian fliers used by the Alector airforce, the Myrmidons. If other forms exist, these are not widely used. Talent creatures tend to explode into flames if sufficiently damaged; this usually incinerates anyone in the vicinity. Pteridons are tied to specific living Alectors (their Myrimdon pilots); they may be easily reassigned if their pilot dies, but are reassigned only with great effort if their pilot still lives.

===Skylances===
The main weapons of mounted Myrmidons, skylances draw on either their stored life-force (enough for one or two firings) or the lifeforce of the pteridon being ridden to emit a stream of blue fire. For security reasons, the design of the skylance, which is a sealed unit, precludes its use without a pteridon. Since a pteridon is tied to a living Alector, this limits the ability of ambitious Alectors to employ these dangerous weapons in rebellion. This is a design decision, and not a limitation on Alector technology generally. Pteridons will retrieve and protect their designated skylance when not in use, or if their pilot has been killed.

===Lightcutters===
Essentially a laser, the lightcutter draws life energy stored in an attached crystal and focuses it into a beam that may be used as a tool, or offensively. A sufficiently Talented Alector can turn aside such beams with his Talent shields, or sometimes even turn them back on the attacker. Because they draw life force, and because ambitious Alectors could use them in rebellion, lightcutters are normally found only in hand held, pistol sized models. Towards the end of the reign of Alectors on Acorus, much more powerful versions existed; these or their plans were brought from Ifryn. Loyal Alectors made their destruction a priority, as their monstrous life force requirements threatened the long-term future of all life on Acorus. While such weapons are deadly, they are also vulnerable. A Talented Alector can sense their presence, and the energy flow present when they operate. At close range, he can isolate and attack the control crystals; the failure of such crystals usually causes an explosion that frees all the stored life force, and sometimes creates a vacuum that drains anyone nearby of their life force.

===Crystal spear thrower===
The crystal spear thrower played a role in the first three novels; it was mentioned obliquely in the prequel trilogy. The engineer who constructed it stated that only one such device might operate in the world at a time. Considering that Alector heavy weapons draw greedily on the planetary life force, one presumes that operating more than one such device would send Acorus hurtling towards a possibly fatal life force deficit, but this is never explicitly stated. A complex mechanism of crystals and wiring, the spear thrower fuses sand (shoveled into a hopper) into glassy flechettes that it hurls from a barrel-like &quot;formulator.&quot; The engineer simply points this at the target. The device can reduce even stony hills to gravel in short order; it was derived from equipment used to cut passes through high land formations in the process of road building.

== Internal chronology ==
The first Alectors reached Corus almost five thousand years prior to &quot;Alector&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Modesitt has said there is no definitive chronology for the books; he has stated that &quot;The Lord Protector&#x27;s Daughter&quot; takes place roughly 200 to 300 years after &quot;Soarer&#x27;s Choice,&quot; and 1,000 to 1,500 years before &quot;Legacies&quot;.

<doc id="479784" wikidata="Q1064288" url="?curid=479784" title="Charles Erwin Wilson">
<text>Charles Erwin Wilson (July 18, 1890 – September 26, 1961) was an American engineer and businessman who served as United States Secretary of Defense from 1953 to 1957 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Known as &quot;Engine Charlie&quot;, he was previously the president and chief executive officer of General Motors. In the wake of the Korean War, he cut the defense budget significantly.

==Early life and career==
Wilson was born in Minerva, Ohio, the son of Thomas E. and Rosalind (née Unkefer) Wilson. After earning a degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1909, he joined the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, where eventually he supervised the engineering of automobile electrical equipment, and during World War I, the development of dynamotors and radio generators for the Army and Navy. Wilson married Jessie Ann Curtis on September 11, 1912. They had six children: Thomas, Edward, Erwin, Lucille,Rosemary and Jeanne.

==General Motors career==
In 1919, Wilson became chief engineer and sales manager of Remy Electric, a General Motors subsidiary. By January 1941 he was the president of General Motors. During World War II, Wilson directed the company&#x27;s huge defense production effort, which earned him a Medal for Merit in 1946. He was still the CEO of General Motors when Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.

==Secretary of Defense==

===Confirmation===
Wilson&#x27;s nomination sparked a controversy that erupted during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, based on his large share ownership in General Motors. Reluctant to sell the stock, valued at the time at more than $2.5 million (or about $24 million in 2018), Wilson agreed to do so under committee pressure. During the hearings, when asked if he could make a decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. But he added that he could not conceive of such a situation &quot;because for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.&quot; That statement has frequently been misquoted as &quot;What&#x27;s good for General Motors is good for the country.&quot; Although Wilson tried for years to correct the misquote, he was reported at the time of his retirement in 1957 to have accepted the popular impression.

Wilson was finally confirmed as Secretary of Defense by a Senate vote of 77 to 6 and began his duties in the Pentagon.

===Tenure===
Both Wilson and Eisenhower entered office committed to reorganizing the US Department of Defense. They succeeded in securing from Congress approval in June 1953 of Reorganization Plan No. 6, which made changes in OSD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chain of command. Wilson welcomed the reorganization plan, which became effective on June 30, 1953, as facilitating more efficient management of the Department of Defense. He considered the assistant secretaries as his &quot;vice presidents&quot; and tried to manage the Pentagon like an industrial corporation. Wilson took advantage of the reorganization to decentralize administration, giving the service secretaries more responsibility and importance. In his first annual report, he noted that the service secretaries were his principal assistants; decentralizing operational responsibility to them would make for effective exercise of civilian authority throughout the Department of Defense. In July 1954, to complement the 1953 reorganization, Wilson issued a directive to the JCS, the most important provision of which stated that &quot;the Joint Staff work of each of the Chiefs of Staff shall take priority over all other duties,&quot; their tasks as chiefs of individual services. The directive also clarified the role of the JCS chairman and his authority over the Joint Staff while making clear that assignment of major tasks to the Joint Staff was the prerogative of the full JCS.

Internal reorganization was only one of several major changes during Wilson&#x27;s tenure, the most important being the &quot;New Look&quot; defense concept. Eisenhower had criticized Truman&#x27;s policies during the 1952 campaign, arguing that they were reactive rather than positive and that they forced the United States to compete with the Soviet Union on the latter&#x27;s terms. Eisenhower entered office with strong convictions about the need to reorient the nation&#x27;s security policy by maintaining a staunch defense while decreasing government expenditures and balancing the budget.

The president inaugurated planning for the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New Look in his State of the Union message in January 1954, and Wilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, he said (or as he sometimes phrased it, &quot;More bang for the buck&quot;). With new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and material, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.

The major features of the New Look included greater reliance on nuclear weapons, using the advantage the United States had over the Soviet Union in such weapons; elevation of strategic air power, the major means to deliver nuclear weapons, to a more important position (not an expansion in the number of Air Force aircraft but rather development and production of better equipment); reductions of conventional ground forces, based both on reliance on strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the expectation that US allies would provide ground troops for their own defense; an expanded program of continental defense, which, along with strategic air power, would serve as a principal ingredient of the New Look&#x27;s deterrence program; and modernization and enlargement of reserve forces, enhancing the military manpower base while reducing active duty forces.

Although the Eisenhower administration generally adhered to the New Look throughout Wilson&#x27;s term, the policy remained controversial. Some critics maintained that it made impossible the fighting of a limited non-nuclear war. The Army and the Navy felt that the increased emphasis on air power and nuclear weapons represented a repudiation the concept of &quot;balanced forces&quot; in which individual service programs were balanced against overall requirements. Implicit in the policy was rejection of the idea that a general war or a crisis with the USSR was imminent (to occur when the Soviets achieved offensive nuclear capability against the United States). Wilson pointed out frequently that defense policy should be long-term and not based on short-term projections of Soviet-American relations. &quot;Military expenditures,&quot; he observed, &quot;must be adequate, but not so great that they will become an intolerable burden which will harm the social and economic fabric of our country. True security cannot be founded on arms and arms alone.&quot;

Wilson worked hard to reduce the defense budget, which meant some immediate cutbacks in fiscal year 1953 funds and a concerted effort to economize in subsequent years. Total obligational authority approved by Congress during Wilson&#x27;s tenure decreased significantly at first and then began to creep back up, but it remained lower than the Truman administration&#x27;s last budgets, inflated because of the Korean War. The TOA for FY 1953, Truman&#x27;s final Defense budget, was $44.2 billion. TOA in subsequent fiscal years was: 1954, $30.4 billion; 1955, $33.7 billion; 1956, $33.06 billion; 1957, $39.7 billion; and 1958, $41.1 billion. Especially after 1954, when the Democratic Party regained control of Congress, the Wilson-Eisenhower effort to curb defense expenditures provoked growing criticism. The Air Force, even though the New Look enhanced its role, opposed the decision to cut back from the Truman goal of 143 wings, and its congressional supporters tried repeatedly, sometimes successfully, to appropriate more money for air power than the administration wanted. The other services, especially the Army, objected to force reductions ordained by the New Look. Both General Ridgway, who retired as Army chief of staff in June 1955, and his successor, General Maxwell D. Taylor, believed that the Army was receiving too small a share of the military budget.

Its standing threatened by the New Look, the Army questioned the wisdom of reliance on &quot;massive retaliation&quot; and strategic air power to the neglect of other force elements. Wilson reportedly observed that the United States &quot;can&#x27;t afford to fight limited wars. We can only afford to fight a big war, and if there is one, that is the kind it will be.&quot; However, by 1955 the Army and, later that decade, the Navy, departed from their emphasis on preparation for total war by urging the need to prepare for limited war, non-global conflicts restricted in geographical area, force size, and weapons although tactical nuclear weapons were not ruled out. Generals Ridgway and Taylor stressed the need to have a variety of forces available and equipped to fight different kinds of war from a local non-nuclear war to a global strategic nuclear conflict. They rejected the notion that limited wars would occur only in less-developed areas and argued that such conflicts might occur in NATO as well.

The Army received indirect support from such critics of massive retaliation as Bernard Brodie, William W. Kaufmann, and Henry A. Kissinger, who noted that the United States and the Soviet Union had or were acquiring the power to destroy each other with strategic nuclear weapons, thus precluding their rational use in response to a limited attack. Taylor, concluding that the Soviet Union and the United States had achieved mutual nuclear deterrence, believed that limited-war forces would play an active role in future conflicts and that atomic retaliatory forces would play a passive role. The Army moved into missile and space programs in an effort to preserve for itself a part in planning for and fighting a nuclear war, but in the late 1950s, it continued to push for adoption of a new national security policy acknowledging the primacy of limited war. While the Eisenhower administration did not adopt the Army&#x27;s position, by the time that Wilson left office, it had accepted both the need to prepare for limited war and the idea that deterrence of a direct attack on US interests required &quot;sufficient,&quot; rather than &quot;superior,&quot; retaliatory capability.

Increased competition among the services resulting from the New Look compelled Wilson to deal with the perennially troublesome question of service roles and missions, complicated by the introduction of new weapons, especially missiles. He noted in his semi-annual report at the end of FY 1956 that the services, which had eight categories of guided missiles available for various tasks, could not agree on their respective roles and missions in relation to these and other planned missile systems. Also at issue were aircraft types for the individual services and Air Force tactical support for the Army. To address those and other nagging questions, Wilson issued two important documents. The former, a memorandum to members of the Armed Forces Policy Council on November 26, 1956, dealt with five points of contention. First, Wilson limited the Army to small aircraft with specifically defined functions within combat zones. On the matter of airlift adequacy, which the Army questioned, the secretary declared current Air Force practices acceptable. As to air defense, the Army received responsibility for point defense of specified geographical areas, vital installations, and cities; the Air Force became responsible for area defense and the interception of enemy attacks away from individual vital installations; and the Navy could maintain ship-based air defense weapon systems. Wilson assigned to the Air Force primary responsibility for tactical support for the Army, although the Army could use surface-to-surface missiles for close support of its field operations. Finally, the secretary gave the Air Force sole authority to operate land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems and the Navy the same responsibility for ship-based IRBMs. He enjoined the Army from planning operational employment of missiles with ranges beyond .

On March 18, 1957, Wilson issued a directive to clarify his earlier decisions on the Army-Air Force use of aircraft for tactical purposes. He made no major changes from the previous division of responsibility but provided a more detailed and specific listing of those functional areas for which the Army could procure its own aircraft and those for which it would rely on the Air Force.

Although Wilson found it necessary to clarify service roles and missions, he did not press for extensive further unification of the armed forces. He established in February 1956 an office of special assistant to the Secretary of Defense for guided missiles but made few other changes after implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 6 in 1953. When asked in 1957 about persistent demands for further unification, Wilson responded, &quot;It&#x27;s an oversimplification in the false hope that you could thus wash out the problems if you put the people all in the same uniform and that then they wouldn&#x27;t disagree over what should be done. Of course, they would.&quot;

Wilson, a folksy, honest, and outspoken man, sometimes got into trouble because of casual remarks. In January 1957, for example, he referred to enlistees in the National Guard during the Korean War as &quot;draft dodgers.&quot; That caused a storm of protest and even brought a rebuke from Eisenhower, who said he thought Wilson had made &quot;a very... unwise statement, without stopping to think what it meant.&quot; On another occasion, Wilson jokingly referred to the White House as a &quot;dung hill,&quot; generating further controversy.

Wilson indicated his intention to retire from office shortly after the start of the second Eisenhower term and left on October 8, 1957. Eisenhower noted when Wilson stepped down that under him, &quot;the strength of our security forces has not only been maintained but has been significantly increased&quot; and that he had managed the Defense Department &quot;in a manner consistent with the requirements of a strong, healthy national economy.&quot;

On October 9, 1957, Eisenhower presented Wilson with the Medal of Freedom.

==Human experimentation==
While serving as Secretary of Defense, Wilson enacted stronger rules against human medical experimentation. The 1953 Wilson Memo led the armed services to adopt the Nuremberg Code. Patients would have to provide written, informed consent.

Wilson wrote, &quot;By reason of the basic medical responsibility in connection with the development of defense of all types against atomic, biological and/or chemical warfare agents, Armed Services personnel and/or civilians on duty at installations engaged in such research shall be permitted to actively participate in all phases of the program.&quot;

Jonathan Moreno and Susan Lederer wrote in a 1996 issue of the &quot;Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal&quot; that the Wilson Memo remained classified until 1975, limiting its availability to researchers. They found the Air Force and Army tried to implement the rules but found spotty compliance in actual Pentagon research.

==&#x27;Dynamic Programming&#x27;==

Mathematician Richard Bellman states in his biography that Wilson disliked the word &quot;research&quot; and recounts in his biography his origin of the term &quot;dynamic programming&quot;--

“I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let’s kill two birds with one stone. Let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that it’s impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.”

==Later life and death==
After he left the Pentagon, Wilson returned to Michigan, where he devoted his time to business and family affairs. He died in Norwood, Louisiana, and was interred at the Acacia Park Cemetery, a Masonic cemetery in Beverly Hills, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.

==Nickname==
Charles Erwin Wilson should not be confused with Charles Edward Wilson, who was the CEO of General Electric and served President Truman as the director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. The two were respectively nicknamed &quot;Engine Charlie&quot; and &quot;Electric Charlie&quot; so that they could be more easily distinguished.

<text>Max, also known as Max/MSP/Jitter, is a visual programming language for music and multimedia developed and maintained by San Francisco-based software company Cycling &#x27;74. Over its more than thirty-year history, it has been used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.

The Max program is modular, with most routines existing as shared libraries. An application programming interface (API) allows third-party development of new routines (named &quot;external objects&quot;). Thus, Max has a large user base of programmers unaffiliated with Cycling &#x27;74 who enhance the software with commercial and non-commercial extensions to the program. Because of this extensible design, which simultaneously represents both the program&#x27;s structure and its graphical user interface (GUI), Max has been described as the lingua franca for developing interactive music performance software.

==History==
=== 1980s ===
Miller Puckette began work on Max in 1985, at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) in Paris. Originally called &quot;The Patcher&quot;, this first version provided composers with a graphical interface for creating interactive computer music scores on the Macintosh. At this point in its development Max couldn&#x27;t perform its own real-time sound synthesis in software, but instead sent control messages to external hardware synthesizers and samplers using MIDI or a similar protocol. Its earliest widely recognized use in composition was for &quot;Pluton&quot;, a 1988 piano and computer piece by Philippe Manoury; the software synchronized a computer to a piano and controlled a Sogitec 4X for audio processing.

In 1989, IRCAM developed &quot;Max/FTS&quot; (&quot;Faster Than Sound&quot;), a version of Max ported to the IRCAM Signal Processing Workstation (ISPW) for the NeXT. Also known as &quot;Audio Max&quot;, it would prove a forerunner to Max&#x27;s MSP audio extensions, adding the ability to do real-time synthesis using an internal hardware digital signal processor (DSP) board. In 1989, IRCAM worked with Joel Chadabe and Ben Austin of Intelligent Computer Music Systems to license the software for commercial sales in the United States. With the 1990 bankruptcy of Intelligent Computer Music Systems, both the &quot;Max&quot; Software and Ben Austin moved to Opcode Systems, which became the publisher of record for &quot;Max&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
Although Opcode launched its commercial version named &quot;Max&quot; in 1990, developed and extended by David Zicarelli, the product was becoming a poor fit for Opcode, which was squarely towards commercial music production. Thus Zicarelli in 1997 acquired the publishing rights and founded a new company, Cycling &#x27;74, to continue commercial development. The timing was fortunate, as Opcode was acquired by Gibson Guitar in 1998 and ended operations in 1999.

IRCAM&#x27;s in-house Max development was also winding down; the last version produced there was &quot;jMax&quot;, a direct descendant of Max/FTS developed in 1998 for Silicon Graphics (SGI) and later for Linux systems. It used Java for its graphical interface and C for its real-time backend, and was eventually released as open-source software.
Meanwhile, Puckette had independently released a fully redesigned open-source composition tool named &quot;Pure Data&quot; (Pd) in 1996, which, despite some underlying engineering differences from the IRCAM versions, continued in the same tradition. Cycling &#x27;74&#x27;s first Max release, in 1997, was derived partly from Puckette&#x27;s work on Pure Data. Called &quot;Max/MSP&quot; (&quot;Max Signal Processing&quot;, or the initials Miller Smith Puckette), it remains the most notable of Max&#x27;s many extensions and incarnations: it made Max capable of manipulating real-time digital audio signals without dedicated DSP hardware. This meant that composers could now create their own complex synthesizers and effects processors using only a general-purpose computer like the Macintosh PowerBook G3.

In 1999, the Netochka Nezvanova collective released &quot;NATO.0+55+3d&quot;, a suite of externals that added extensive real-time video control to Max.

=== 2000s ===
Though NATO.0+55+3d became increasingly popular among multimedia artists, its development stopped abruptly in 2001. &quot;SoftVNS&quot;, another set of extensions for visual processing in Max, was released in 2002 by Canadian media artist David Rokeby. Cycling &#x27;74 released their own set of video extensions, &quot;Jitter&quot;, alongside Max 4 in 2003, adding real-time video, OpenGL graphics, and matrix processing capabilities. Max 4 was also the first version to run on Windows. Max 5, released in 2008, redesigned the patching GUI for the first time in Max&#x27;s commercial history.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Max 6 added a new audio engine compatible with 64-bit operating systems, integration with Ableton Live sequencer software, and an extension called Gen, which can compile optimized Max patches for higher performance. Max 7 was released in 2014 and focused on 3D rendering improvements.

On June 6, 2017, Ableton announced its purchase of Cycling &#x27;74, with Max continuing to be published by Cycling &#x27;74 and David Zicarelli remaining with the company.

On September 25, 2018 Max 8 was released. Some of the new features include MC, a new way to work with multiple channels, JavaScript support with Node for Max, and Vizzie 2.

=== 2020s ===
On October 29, 2024 Max 9, the most recent major version of the software, was released.

==Language==
Max is named after composer Max Mathews, and can be considered a descendant of his MUSIC language, though its graphical nature disguises that fact. Like most MUSIC-N languages, Max distinguishes between two levels of time: that of an &quot;event&quot; scheduler, and that of the DSP (this corresponds to the distinction between k-rate and a-rate processes in Csound, and control rate vs. audio rate in SuperCollider).

The basic language of Max and its sibling programs is that of a data-flow system: Max programs (named &quot;patches&quot;) are made by arranging and connecting building-blocks of &quot;objects&quot; within a &quot;patcher&quot;, or visual canvas. These objects act as self-contained programs (in reality, they are dynamically linked libraries), each of which may receive input (through one or more visual &quot;inlets&quot;), generate output (through visual &quot;outlets&quot;), or both. Objects pass messages from their outlets to the inlets of connected objects.

Max supports six basic atomic data types that can be transmitted as messages from object to object: int, float, list, symbol, bang, and signal (for MSP audio connections). Several more complex data structures exist within the program for handling numeric arrays (&quot;table&quot; data), hash tables (&quot;coll&quot; data), XML information (&quot;pattr&quot; data), and JSON-based dictionaries (&quot;dict&quot; data). An MSP data structure (&quot;buffer~&quot;) can hold digital audio information within program memory. In addition, the Jitter package adds a scalable, multi-dimensional data structure for handling large sets of numbers for storing video and other datasets (&quot;matrix&quot; data).

Max is typically learned through acquiring a vocabulary of objects and how they function within a patcher; for example, the &quot;metro&quot; object functions as a simple metronome, and the &quot;random&quot; object generates random integers. Most objects are non-graphical, consisting only of an object&#x27;s name and several arguments-attributes (in essence class properties) typed into an &quot;object box&quot;. Other objects are graphical, including sliders, number boxes, dials, table editors, pull-down menus, buttons, and other objects for running the program interactively. Max/MSP/Jitter comes with about 600 of these objects as the standard package; extensions to the program can be written by third-party developers as Max patchers (e.g. by encapsulating some of the functionality of a patcher into a sub-program that is itself a Max patch), or as objects written in C, C++, Java, or JavaScript.

The order of execution for messages traversing through the graph of objects is defined by the visual organization of the objects in the patcher itself. As a result of this organizing principle, Max is unusual in that the program logic and the interface as presented to the user are typically related, though newer versions of Max provide several technologies for more standard GUI design.

Max documents (named patchers) can be bundled into stand-alone applications and distributed free or sold commercially. In addition, Max can be used to author audio and MIDI plugin software for Ableton Live through the Max for Live extension.

With the increased integration of laptop computers into live music performance (in electronic music and elsewhere), Max/MSP and Max/Jitter have received attention as a development environment available to those serious about laptop music/video performance. Programs sharing Max&#x27;s visual programming concepts are now commonly used for real-time audio and video synthesis and processing.

<doc id="479798" wikidata="Q2900109" url="?curid=479798" title="Rumpole of the Bailey">
<text>Rumpole of the Bailey is a British television series created and written by the British writer and barrister John Mortimer. It starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, a middle-aged London barrister who defended a broad variety of clients, often underdogs. The popularity of the TV series led to the stories being presented in other media, including books and radio.

The &quot;Bailey&quot; of the title is a reference to the Central Criminal Court, the &quot;Old Bailey&quot;.

==Characters==
===Horace Rumpole===
While certain biographical details differ slightly between the original television series and the subsequent book series, Horace Rumpole has a number of definite character traits that are constant. First and foremost, he loves the courtroom. Despite attempts by his friends and family to get him to move on to a more respectable position for his age, such as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) or a Circuit Judge (positions Rumpole sarcastically calls &quot;Queer Customers&quot; and &quot;Circus Judges&quot;), he only enjoys defending his clients (who are often legal aid cases) at the Old Bailey, London&#x27;s Central Criminal Court: &quot;the honour of being an Old Bailey Hack&quot;, as he describes his work. A devotee of Arthur Quiller-Couch&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot;, he often quotes Wordsworth (and other poets less frequently, e.g. Shakespeare). He privately refers to his wife, Hilda, as &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot;, a reference to the fearsome queen in H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;She&quot;.

His skill at defending his clients is legendary among the criminal classes. The Timson clan of &quot;minor villains&quot; (primarily thieves) regularly rely on Rumpole to get them out of their latest bit of trouble with the law. Rumpole is proud of his successful handling of the Penge Bungalow Murders &quot;alone and without a leader&quot; (that is, as a &quot;junior&quot; barrister without a QC) early in his career and of his extensive knowledge of bloodstains and typewriters. Cross-examination is one of his favourite activities, and he disdains barristers who lack either the skill or courage to ask the right questions. His courtroom zeal gets him into trouble from time to time. Often, his investigations reveal more than his client wants him to know. Rumpole&#x27;s chanciest encounters stem from arguing with judges, particularly those who seem to believe that being on trial implies guilt or that the police are infallible.

Rumpole enjoys smoking inexpensive cigars (cheroots), drinking cheap red wine and a diet of fried breakfasts, overboiled vegetables and steak and kidney pudding. Every day he visits &quot;Pomeroy&#x27;s&quot;, a wine bar on Fleet Street within walking distance of the Old Bailey and his chambers at Equity Court, at which he contributes regularly to an ever-increasing bar tab by purchasing glasses of red wine of questionable quality, which he calls variously &quot;Cooking Claret&quot;, &quot;Pomeroy&#x27;s Plonk&quot;, &quot;Pomeroy&#x27;s Very Ordinary&quot;, &quot;Chateau Thames Embankment&quot;, or &quot;Chateau Fleet Street&quot;.

His cigar smoking is often the subject of debate within his chambers. His peers sometimes criticise his attire, noting his old, battered Homburg hat, imperfectly aligned clothes, cigar ash trailing down his waistcoat and faded barrister&#x27;s wig, &quot;bought second hand from a former Chief Justice of Tonga&quot; (or the Windward Islands: Rumpole is occasionally an unreliable narrator).

Despite his affection for the criminal classes, Rumpole has firm ethics. He is a staunch believer in the presumption of innocence, the &quot;Golden Thread of British Justice&quot;. He often reinforces this by proclaiming that it is better for ten guilty men to go free than for one innocent to be convicted (essentially Blackstone&#x27;s formulation).

Accordingly, Rumpole&#x27;s credo is &quot;I never plead guilty&quot;, although he has qualified that credo by stating on several occasions that he is morally bound to enter a guilty plea if he knows for a fact that the defendant is guilty of the crime of which they are accused (in fact, he enters a guilty plea on behalf of his clients in &quot;Rumpole&#x27;s Last Case&quot;). But if he has any doubt whatsoever about the facts surrounding the commission of the crime, even if the defendant has confessed to the deed (having stated, and proved, on one occasion that &quot;there is no piece of evidence more unreliable than a confession!&quot;), Rumpole feels equally honour bound to enter a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and offer the best defence possible. His &quot;never plead guilty&quot; credo also prevents him from making deals that involve pleading guilty to lesser charges (again, with some exceptions; in &quot;Rumpole and the Tap End&quot; he persuades his client to plead guilty to assault in exchange for the dismissal of a charge of attempted murder).

Rumpole also refuses to prosecute, feeling it more important to defend the accused than to work to imprison them. There was one exception, when Rumpole took on a private prosecution, working for a private citizen rather than for the crown, but he proved that the defendant was innocent and then reaffirmed, &quot;from now on, Rumpole only defends&quot;.

Some of Rumpole&#x27;s clients feel that things would have been better for them if they had been found guilty and resent him for getting them off.

Mortimer&#x27;s 2009 obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; confirmed that Rumpole was, in part, based on a chance meeting in court with James Burge QC:

====Biographical information (television)====
In the television series, where Rumpole first appeared, there is some consistency with regard to Rumpole&#x27;s backstory. The original play is set in 1974, and Rumpole says he is 64 years old, suggesting a birthdate of 1910 (Leo McKern, the actor who played Rumpole, was born in 1920). Rumpole&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot; is inscribed &quot;Horace Rumpole, Little Wicks School 1923. Cursed be he who steals this book,&quot; (Series 4 – 1987); in &quot;Rumpole and the Fascist Beast&quot; it is mentioned that he studied at Birkenshaw School, which he calls &quot;a wind-blasted penal colony on the Norfolk coast&quot;; he bought his barrister&#x27;s wig in 1932; first appeared in court in 1937; first met Hilda on 14 August 1938; served in the RAF Ground Staff in World War II; married Hilda in approximately 1944; won the Penge Bungalow Murder case in 1947; and had his son Nick in 1951. The series itself takes place between 1967 and 1992, when Rumpole is getting on in years.

====Biographical information (books)====
Within many short stories and occasional novels, which were written over a 29-year period (1978–2007), Rumpole&#x27;s biographical details fluctuated. For example, in the first book, published in 1978, Rumpole mentions buying his wig in 1932, and another time to proposing to Hilda in 1938, and his &quot;sixty-eight next birthday&quot;. In &quot;Rumpole and the Fascist Beast&quot; it is mentioned that Rumpole was born sometime before the outbreak of World War I. These last two pieces of information would indicate a birth year of 1911, but later books contradict this. &quot;Rumpole and the Primrose Path&quot;, for instance, appeared in 2003 and was set in the present day, but Rumpole was in his seventies, not 92. Nonetheless, when in &quot;Rumpole and the Primrose Path&quot; Erskine-Brown asks Rumpole what he sings to himself when he is alone, Rumpole replies, &quot;A ballad of the war years.&quot;

In general, in the book series, it would seem that Rumpole has been frozen at an age of around 70 years, and past events in his life have been retconned to fit each story&#x27;s time frame. Thus, in the books published in 1996 and before, he proposed to Hilda in 1938, and in books published in 2003 and after, it appears that he neither became a barrister nor met Hilda until after World War II ended in 1945. &quot;Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders&quot;, containing his first unled case and his engagement to Hilda, takes place in the early 1950s, entirely inconsistent with the early stories. Since 1988, when Phyllida Erskine-Brown became a QC and &quot;Soapy&quot; Sam Ballard became Head of Chambers, the other characters seem to be similarly frozen in time. In &quot;Rumpole and the Reign of Terror&quot;, Rumpole was still practising in 2006, and Judge Bullingham was still in post – unless this is a different Bullingham, but that is never stated explicitly. In the 1990 story &quot;Rumpole at Sea&quot;, Rumpole says of Bullingham: &quot;But now we have lost him.&quot; The prior &quot;Mad Bull&quot; was Roger Bullingham, and this Bullingham&#x27;s name is Leonard.

The son of Reverend Wilfred Rumpole and his wife Alice, and born at Dulwich, Rumpole attended &quot;Linklater&#x27;s&quot; (a fictional minor public school) and studied law at either Keble College or the fictional &quot;St Joseph&#x27;s College&quot;, Oxford, coming away with &quot;a dubious third&quot; (Oxford then awarded fourths, so a third is equivalent to a 2:2). Rumpole was called to the bar at the &quot;Outer Temple&quot; (a fictional Inn of Court, named on the analogy of the Inner Temple, where John Mortimer was called, and the Middle Temple).

===Rumpole&#x27;s family===
Apart from the legal drama in each story, Rumpole also has to deal with his relationships with family and friends. His wife Hilda (whom he refers to as &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot;) was proud of her &quot;daddy&quot; (as she calls him), C. H. Wystan, who was Rumpole&#x27;s Head of Chambers, and she frequently advocates that Rumpole seek a higher position in the legal world such as Head of Chambers, Queen&#x27;s Counsel or a judgeship. The Rumpoles reside in a cavernous, underheated mansion flat at 25B Froxbury Mansions (sometimes called Froxbury Court), Gloucester Road, London.

Rumpole raises tensions with his American daughter-in-law Erica (Deborah Fallender) because of their differing views (such as her disapproval of his cross-examining a rape victim he believed to be lying). His associates&#x27; dynamic social positions contrast with his relatively static views, which causes feelings between him and the others to shift over time.

Rumpole retired for a short period of time, moving to Florida to be near his son Nick, a sociology professor and now department head at the University of Miami.
Nick is described by Rumpole as &quot;the brains of the family&quot;. Nick was educated at public school as a teenager, then studied at Oxford University and Princeton. His academic visit to Baltimore University was determinant for staying in the US. Rumpole often says that Nick is proud of his father&#x27;s work in criminal law, and enjoyed his accounts of his cases and &quot;harmless legal anecdotes&quot;.

==Cast==
In total, seven series of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; were made from 1978 to 1992, each consisting of six episodes. A special two-hour film, &quot;Rumpole&#x27;s Return&quot;, was made and aired in 1980, between the second and third series. The author, John Mortimer, occasionally appeared as an extra.
Rumpole and his family:
* Horace W. Rumpole: Self-described &quot;Old Bailey hack&quot; who defends any and all clients, and never pleads guilty. His strong preference is for criminal cases, but Rumpole has occasionally taken on family law and libel cases. He usually defends clients dependent on legal aid, but sometimes represents paying clients, which he calls &quot;money briefs&quot;. He loves quoting poetry, especially works by William Wordsworth and other poems from &quot;The Oxford Book of English Verse.
* Hilda Rumpole (Joyce Heron) (Original &quot;Play for Today&quot; &quot;Pilot&quot;); (Peggy Thorpe-Bates) (Series 1–3 and Special); (Marion Mathie) (Series 4–7): Privately referred to by Rumpole as &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot; – a reference to the Rider Haggard novel &quot;&quot;. She would dearly love to see Rumpole become a QC, Head of Chambers or a judge – none of which is a role to which Rumpole aspires. She is the daughter of Rumpole&#x27;s late head of chambers, C. H. Wystan.
* Nicholas Rumpole (David Yelland) (&quot;Play for Today&quot;, plus Series 1–2); (Ian Gelder) (Special only): &quot;The brains of the family&quot;, as Rumpole calls him. Nick and his father are especially close. Nick studied PPE at Oxford and then sociology at Princeton. Married to an American, he eventually moves to the United States (first Baltimore, then Miami) to work as a professor of sociology.

Members of Rumpole&#x27;s Chambers at 3 Equity Court, London:
* Sir Guthrie Featherstone QC (Peter Bowles) (Series 1–2, Special, and as an occasional guest star in series 3–7). The well-connected if occasionally feckless Head of Chambers, he &quot;took silk&quot; (becoming a Queen&#x27;s Counsel) and was elected to Parliament as a Social Democratic Party member early in the series. Rumpole often mock-reverently calls him &quot;our learned Head of Chambers, Guthrie Featherstone QC, MP&quot;. He is an alumnus of Marlborough College. He becomes a High Court judge after the third series and is embroiled in a number of controversies after being promoted to the bench. Although often in some way in opposition to Rumpole, the two get on far better than do Rumpole and Ballard; Featherstone lacks Ballard&#x27;s piousness, to which Rumpole takes great exception.
* Samuel Ballard QC (Peter Blythe) (Series 3–7): Head of Chambers in later series; a very pious and priggish person, and like his predecessor, a Marlborough alumnus. Rumpole refers to him as &quot;Soapy Sam&quot; which is an allusion to a much-parodied 19th century Bishop of Oxford, and generally addresses him as &quot;Bollard&quot;. Later became a judge in the ecclesiastical courts, while maintaining his role as Head of Chambers.
* Phyllida (née Trant) Erskine-Brown QC (Patricia Hodge) (Series 1–2, Special, and as an occasional guest star in series 3–7). First appeared in episode four in the first series as Erskine-Brown&#x27;s (and later Rumpole&#x27;s) pupil, Phyllida Trant. The &quot;Portia of our Chambers&quot;, Phyllida is a strong advocate with definite opinions of her own. Usually, but not always, sides with Rumpole in Chambers matters. She eventually becomes a Q.C., then a Recorder, and then a High Court judge. She is shown to occasionally flirt with extramarital relationships, but considers Claude&#x27;s positive points and remains in her marriage.
* Claude Leonard Erskine-Brown QC (Julian Curry): Phyllida&#x27;s husband, &quot;opera buff and hopeless cross-examiner&quot;, and sometime would-be philanderer. Although not lacking in personal ambition, he acknowledges his wife&#x27;s drive and is more than willing to do the lion&#x27;s share of looking after their children, stating that he&#x27;d be happy to move to a more paperwork-based role; he is eventually promoted to Assistant Recorder, and later Q.C., through Phyllida&#x27;s manoeuvrings. Upon hearing of his promotion, Judge Graves remarked, &quot;They must be handing out silk gowns with pounds of tea nowadays!&quot; He particularly loves the operas of Wagner, and his and Phyllida&#x27;s children are named Tristan and Isolde. He frowns upon Rumpole&#x27;s clientele, having a largely civil practice, with only an occasional criminal prosecution. Despite this attitude, Rumpole helps Erskine-Brown out in important personal matters without Erskine-Brown&#x27;s knowledge, and is displeased when he makes the acquaintance of one of Erskine-Brown&#x27;s schoolmates, who mentions that since Erskine-Brown was a &quot;pill&quot; at school he warranted bullying. He attended Bogstead School, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.
* T.C. Rowley, widely known as &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; (Richard Murdoch) (Series 1–6 and Special). &quot;The oldest member of Chambers, who has not had a brief as long as any of us can remember.&quot; Rumpole first joined C. H. Wystan&#x27;s chambers as Uncle Tom&#x27;s pupil. He is usually seen happily practising his golf putting in the clerk&#x27;s room, or offering cheerfully inappropriate comments in Chambers&#x27; meetings.
* George Frobisher (Moray Watson) (Series 1–2, Special, and as an occasional guest star in Series 3–5). A sensible if somewhat stiff barrister and Rumpole&#x27;s closest friend in Chambers. At around the time he becomes a Circuit Judge, his love interest meets Rumpole, and fears he recognises her from an arson case years ago; she leaves Frobisher, with no way to get in contact. Although Frobisher admits he will find it hard to forgive Rumpole for this loss of happiness, in his next appearance, as a circuit judge presiding over a statutory rape case in which Rumpole is defending, he remains friendly, but refuses to bow to Rumpole&#x27;s persuasion and jails the defendant; from this point on, Rumpole clearly has a jaundiced view of Frobisher in spite of the latter&#x27;s friendly overtures, making barbed comments about what he considers Frobisher&#x27;s draconian legal views in much the same way as he disdains other judges. A former Army officer, Frobisher becomes a Judge Advocate for the British Army in series 4; to Rumpole&#x27;s dismay, he is pompously absorbed in the military legal way of doing things, and upbraids Rumpole on numerous occasions for not acting appropriately.
* Percy Hoskins (Norman Ettlinger) (Series 1, Episode 1 only); (Denys Graham) (Series 3–6): A rather minor character, Hoskins seems chiefly concerned with keeping other lawyers from being admitted to Chambers, lest they take away his work. Often prefaces his arguments with the phrase &quot;Speaking as a man with daughters...&quot; Later promoted to a judgeship.
* Fiona Allways (Rosalyn Landor) (Series 3 only): Originally Phyllida Erskine-Brown&#x27;s pupil, Rumpole took a liking to her, mentored her, and got her admitted to Chambers. A daughter of the landed gentry, the character left Chambers to get married and was replaced by Liz Probert.
* Liz Probert (Samantha Bond) (Series 4); (Abigail McKern, Leo McKern&#x27;s daughter) (Series 5–7): An outspoken young feminist barrister in Rumpole&#x27;s chambers, who describes herself as a &quot;young radical&quot; and is referred to by Rumpole as &quot;Miz Liz&quot;. Her father &quot;Red Ron&quot; is a prominent trade union official. Rumpole&#x27;s wife Hilda once suspected him of having an affair with Liz. Introduced in episode 2 in series 4 and becomes Rumpole&#x27;s pupil.
* Dave Inchcape: (Michael Grandage) (Series 5, Episode 6 only); (Christopher Milburn) (Series 6–7): A young lawyer who has a sometimes stormy relationship with &quot;Miz Liz&quot;. He is later revealed to be the Honourable David Luxton.
* Charles Hearthstoke: (Nicholas Gecks) (Series 4, Episodes 4, 6);(Martin Turner) (Series 5, Episode 4): Called &quot;Hearthrug&quot; by Rumpole. Another young lawyer, brought in by Ballard at least in part to streamline the operations of Chambers, a move Rumpole and Henry both opposed for differing reasons. Hearthstoke woos Liz Probert during his stint in Chambers, but is ultimately forced out by Rumpole. After departing, he is later tempted to return by the possibility of a romantic &quot;adventure&quot; with Phyllida. Rumpole&#x27;s intervention prevents this.

Other Staff at 3 Equity Court, London:
* Albert Handyside (Derek Benfield) (Series 1–2 and Special): The original clerk of Chambers. Fired in the third episode, he remains friendly with Rumpole and gets him the occasional case from the firm of solicitors that he joins as a clerk.
* Henry Trench (Jonathan Coy): Albert&#x27;s successor as the efficient but harried clerk of Chambers. Unhappily married, Henry is also an amateur dramatics enthusiast, frequently appearing in works by Noël Coward. Henry&#x27;s wife is active in local politics and serves as a member and later mayor of their local borough council.
* Dianne (Maureen Darbyshire) (Series 1–6 and Special): The oft-seen but rarely heard Chambers secretary, and Henry&#x27;s flame. She eventually leaves Chambers and marries.
* Dot Clapton (Camille Coduri) (Series 7): The new Chambers secretary after Diane leaves. A friendly chatterbox, especially in contrast to the quiet Diane.

Frequent courtroom allies and adversaries:
* Mr Bernard (Edward de Souza) (Series 1); (Denis Lill) (Series 3–7): An instructing solicitor who frequently presents Rumpole with clients – often a hapless member of the Timson clan. Known to Rumpole as &quot;Bonny Bernard&quot;.
* His Honour Judge Roger Bullingham (Bill Fraser) (Series 1–4 and Special): &quot;The Mad Bull&quot;, Rumpole&#x27;s most notorious courtroom enemy. Noted for his intense dislike of defending barristers in general, and of Rumpole in particular.
* Mr Justice Vosper (Donald Eccles) (Series 2): A humourless, elderly judge who does not like Rumpole.
* Detective Inspector Brush (Struan Rodger) (Series 2–5): A police officer intent on seeing accused criminals put away. Rumpole is generally contemptuous of Inspector Brush and his &quot;unreliable notebook&quot;.
* Mr Justice Gerald Graves (Robin Bailey) (Series 4–7): Another in a long line of judges who dislikes Rumpole&#x27;s courtroom theatrics. Privately referred to by Rumpole as &quot;Mr. Justice Gravestone&quot;, and once referred to as &quot;Mr. Injustice Death&#x27;s Head&quot;. Originally merely Judge Graves, elevated to high court status in the series 6 episode &quot;Rumpole at Sea&quot;.
* Mr Justice Oliver Oliphant (James Grout) (Series 6–7): A judge whose affectations of Northern bluntness and &quot;common sense&quot; drive Rumpole to distraction and disdain.

Others in Rumpole&#x27;s life:
* Lady Marigold Featherstone (Joanna Van Gyseghem): Guthrie&#x27;s social-climbing wife.
* Fred Timson (Peter Childs) (Series 1–2); (John Bardon) (Series 4–7): Head of the Timson clan, a family of &quot;minor South London villains&quot;. The Timsons, who specialise in non-violent petty theft, often turn to Rumpole to defend them against charges arising from their latest brush with the law. Although many Timsons are seen through the course of the series, only Fred and Dennis (below) are series regulars.
* Dennis Timson (Ron Pember) (Series 4–7): Another member of the Timson clan who frequently requires Rumpole&#x27;s services, either for himself or for a family member.
* Tony Timson (Phil Davis) (Series 5, Episode 4): Yet another member of the Timson clan, this one features prominently in &quot;Rumpole and the Tap End&quot;.
* Peter &quot;Peanuts&quot; Molloy (David Squire) (Series 1, Episode1; Series 4, Episode 6; Series 5, Episode 4): Member of the Molloy family, archrivals of the Timsons. This legume-lover has frequent run-ins with the law. Also known to date April Timson, wife of Tony Timson.
* Jack Pomeroy (Peter Whitaker) (Series 1); (Eric Dodson) (Series 3–5): Owner of Pomeroy&#x27;s Wine Bar, to which Rumpole often repairs for a glass of &quot;Pomeroy&#x27;s Plonk&quot;.
* Keith (Peter Cartwright) (Series 2 and 5): Almost invariably referred to as &quot;Old Keith from the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s office&quot;. Has the ear of the Lord Chancellor, and is largely responsible (it seems) for determining who will be promoted to Queen&#x27;s Counsel, or to judgeships.
* Dodo Mackintosh (Ann Way) (Series 3–5): A school friend of Hilda&#x27;s who is often mentioned. Barely tolerated by Rumpole, she stops by to visit the Rumpoles on several occasions. Her maiden name is Dodo Perkins.
* F. I. G. &quot;Fig&quot; Newton (Full name: Ferdinand Isaac Gerald Newton) (Jim Norton) (Series 3); (Frank Mills) (Series 5–6): Rumpole&#x27;s favourite private investigator, who is usually battling a cold as he&#x27;s often called on to tail suspects through the pouring rain. In his first appearance, when played by Norton, he introduces himself as &quot;F&quot;erdinand &quot;I&quot;an &quot;G&quot;ilmour Newton. All later appearances were by Mills, and in these appearances Rumpole refers to him as &quot;F&quot;erdinand &quot;I&quot;saac &quot;G&quot;erald Newton.
* Marguerite &quot;Matey&quot; Ballard (Rowena Cooper) (Series 5–7): The matron of the Old Bailey and widow of Mr Plumstead, who later becomes &quot;Soapy Sam&quot; Ballard&#x27;s incongruously blunt wife.

==Production==

===Origins===
The origins of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; lie in &quot;Infidelity Took Place&quot;, a one-off television play for the BBC&#x27;s 1960s television anthology drama series, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; that was written by John Mortimer and broadcast by BBC TV on 18 May 1968. This satirical play, a comment on newly enacted English divorce laws, told the story of a happily married couple who decide to get divorced to take advantage of the more beneficial tax situation they would enjoy if legally separated. The play features a character, Leonard Hoskins (played by John Nettleton), a divorce lawyer with a domineering mother, who can be seen as an early prototype of Rumpole. Mortimer also drew parallels with his 1957 radio play &quot;The Dock Brief&quot;, in which elderly and unsuccessful barrister Morganhall (Michael Hordern) is called upon to defend a man, Fowle (David Kossoff), accused of murder. Morganhall hopes that a not guilty verdict will bring him the fame that has so far eluded him, but when Fowle is convicted and sentenced to death, he is granted a reprieve on the grounds of Morganhall&#x27;s desultory performance in court.

In the mid-1970s, Mortimer approached BBC producer Irene Shubik, who had overseen &quot;Infidelity Took Place&quot; and who was now one of the two producers overseeing &quot;Play For Today&quot; – the successor series to &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; as the BBC&#x27;s strand for contemporary drama. Mortimer presented an idea for a new play, titled &quot;My Darling Prince Peter Kropotkin&quot;, that centred on a barrister called Horace Rumbold. Rumbold would have a particular interest in nineteenth-century anarchists, especially the Russian Peter Kropotkin from whom the title of the play was drawn. The character&#x27;s name was later changed to Horace Rumpole when it was discovered that there was a real barrister called Horace Rumbold. The title of the play was briefly changed to &quot;Jolly Old Jean Jacques Rousseau&quot; before settling on the less esoteric &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;.

Mortimer was keen on Michael Hordern for the role of Rumpole. When Hordern proved unavailable, the part went to Australian-born actor Leo McKern. Mortimer was initially unenthusiastic about McKern&#x27;s casting but changed his opinion upon seeing him at rehearsal. Cast as Hilda was Joyce Heron, who played the character as a much tougher individual than that later seen in the eventual series. Aside from Rumpole and his family, no other characters who would eventually be series regulars were seen in the &quot;Play For Today&quot; production of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;—with the possible exception of a fellow lawyer named George, who could be an early version of eventual series character George Frobisher. (Note that in the series, George Frobisher was played in a very different style by a different actor).

&quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; made its television debut on 17 December 1975 to good reviews by the critics.

===The series===
Aware of the potential for further stories centred on Rumpole, Irene Shubik approached the BBC&#x27;s Head of Plays, Christopher Morahan, and obtained permission from him to commission a further six &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; scripts from John Mortimer. However, Morahan left his post at the BBC a short time later and his successor was not interested in turning &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; into a series. At around this time, Shubik was contacted by Verity Lambert, Head of Drama at Thames Television, who was looking for ideas for an up-market drama series. Impressed with &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, Lambert offered Shubik the opportunity to bring the series to Thames. John Mortimer readily agreed, since it would mean more money, and Shubik (and &quot;Rumpole&quot;) duly left the BBC in late 1976.

&quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; made its Thames Television debut on 3 April 1978 in a series of six episodes. These introduced and established the supporting characters including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles), Claude Erskine-Browne (Julian Curry) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). The role of Hilda was recast, with Peggy Thorpe-Bates taking on the part. Other than McKern, David Yelland (who played Rumpole&#x27;s son Nick) was the only cast member from the BBC &quot;Play For Today&quot; who also became a regular in the series.

Rob Page&#x27;s title sequence, featuring amusing caricatures of Rumpole, was inspired by the nineteenth-century cartoonist George Cruikshank, who had illustrated the works of Charles Dickens. The music was composed by Joseph Horovitz, whose extensive use of the bassoon for Rumpole&#x27;s theme complemented Leo McKern&#x27;s portly stature and sonorous voice. Mortimer continued to work as a barrister while writing the series, rising at 5:30am to write scripts before going to work at the Old Bailey. The series was critically acclaimed (&quot;Not to be missed. Leo McKern is superb as the wild and witty barrister Rumpole&quot; – &quot;The Times&quot;; &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say the BBC threw away a pearl richer than all its tribe but it has mislaid a tasty box of kippers&quot; – Nancy Banks-Smith, &quot;The Guardian&quot;) and Thames quickly commissioned a second series. However, upset to see that her pay had reduced while McKern and Mortimer had received increases for the second series, Shubik&#x27;s relationship with Verity Lambert deteriorated and, in the end, she quit Thames after commissioning three of the six scripts for the second series. Shubik moved to Granada Television, where she produced an adaptation of Paul Scott&#x27;s &quot;Staying On&quot; and set up, but did not produce, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, the follow-up adaptation of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Raj Quartet&quot;. &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; continued under a new production team.

When &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; returned for its fourth series in 1987, Marion Mathie took over as Hilda when Peggy Thorpe-Bates retired because of poor health.

=== Locations ===
&quot;Number 3 Equity Court&quot;, Rumpole&#x27;s chambers, are in King&#x27;s Bench Walk in the Inner Temple Inns of Court. Mortimer, however, has also given the address as &quot;Number Two Equity Court&quot;, as in Chapter Two of the 1980 novel &quot;Rumpole&#x27;s Return&quot;; or &quot;4 Equity Court&quot;, as in the 2005 story &quot;Rumpole and Father Christmas&quot;, later compiled in the UK collection &quot;Rumpole At Christmas&quot; (entitled &quot;A Rumpole Christmas&quot; in the United States). According to the story &quot;Rumpole and the Younger Generation&quot;, Horace and Hilda Rumpole live in a &quot;mansion flat&quot; at 25B Froxbury Court, Gloucester Road, a building sometimes referred to as Froxbury Mansions.

==Episodes==

==In other media==
===Radio===
Since 1980 there were a number of different BBC radio productions derived from the Rumpole stories. Essentially there were two different series and three Christmas specials – yielding a grand total of 40 episodes. Five different actors portrayed Horace Rumpole in these episodes: Leo McKern, Maurice Denham, Timothy West, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Julian Rhind-Tutt.

In 1997, abridged readings of two &quot;Rumpole&quot; stories from &quot;Rumpole for the Defence&quot; (&quot;Rumpole and the Dearly Departed&quot; and &quot;Rumpole and the Boat People&quot;), abridged by Bob Sinfield and performed by Leo McKern, were broadcast on BBC Radio 2, subsequently rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

===Books===
John Mortimer adapted his television scripts into a series of short stories and novels starting in 1978. A series of anthologies and omnibus editions were also released.

<text>Max Vernon Mathews (November 13, 1926 – April 21, 2011) was an American pioneer of computer music.

==Biography==
 Max Vernon Mathews was born in Columbus, Nebraska, to two science schoolteachers. His father in particular taught physics, chemistry and biology in the Peru High School of Nebraska, where he was also the principal. His father allowed him to learn and play in the physics, biology and chemistry laboratories, where he enjoyed making lots of things from motors to mercury barometers. At the age of 9, when students are usually introduced to algebra, he started to study by himself the subject with few other students. That was because the vast majority of population there were farmers and their sons weren&#x27;t interested about learning algebra, since it isn&#x27;t useful for the everyday work. In the same way he studied calculus, but he never graduated from high school.

After a period as a radar repairman in the navy, where he fell in love with electronics, Mathews decided to study electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving a Sc.D. in 1954. Working at Bell Labs, Mathews wrote MUSIC, the first widely used program for sound generation, in 1957. For the rest of the century, he continued as a leader in digital audio research, synthesis, and human-computer interaction as it pertains to music performance. In 1968, Mathews and L. Rosler developed Graphic 1, an interactive graphical sound system on which one could draw figures using a light-pen that would be converted into sound, simplifying the process of composing computer generated music. Also in 1970, Mathews and F. R. Moore developed the GROOVE (Generated Real-time Output Operations on Voltage-controlled Equipment) system, a first fully developed music synthesis system for interactive composition and realtime performance, using 3C/Honeywell DDP-24 (or DDP-224) minicomputers. It used a CRT display to simplify the management of music synthesis in realtime, 12bit D/A for realtime sound playback, an interface for analog devices, and even several controllers including a musical keyboard, knobs, and rotating joysticks to capture realtime performance.

Although MUSIC was not the first attempt to generate sound with a computer (an Australian CSIRAC computer played tunes as early as 1951), Mathews fathered generations of digital music tools. He described his work in parental terms, in the following excerpt from &quot;Horizons in Computer Music&quot;, March 8–9, 1997, Indiana University:


In 1961, Mathews arranged the accompaniment of the song &quot;Daisy Bell&quot; for an uncanny performance by computer-synthesized human voice, using technology developed by John Kelly, Carol Lochbaum, Joan Miller and Lou Gerstman of Bell Laboratories. Author Arthur C. Clarke was coincidentally visiting friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility at the time of this remarkable speech synthesis demonstration and was so impressed that he later told Stanley Kubrick to use it in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, in the climactic scene where the HAL 9000 computer sings while his cognitive functions are disabled.

Mathews directed the Acoustical and Behavioral Research Center at Bell Laboratories from 1962 to 1985, which carried out research in speech communication, visual communication, human memory and learning, programmed instruction, analysis of subjective opinions, physical acoustics, and industrial robotics. From 1974 to 1980 he was the Scientific Advisor to the Institute de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Paris, France, and from 1987 was Professor of Music (Research) at Stanford University. He served as the Master of Ceremonies for the concert program of NIME-01, the inaugural conference on New interfaces for musical expression.

Mathews was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Acoustical Society of America, the IEEE, and the Audio Engineering Society. He received a Silver Medal in Musical Acoustics from the Acoustical Society of America, and the Chevalier de l&#x27;ordre des Arts et Lettres, République Française.

The Max portion of the software package Max/MSP is named after him (the MSP portion is named for Miller Puckette, who teaches at UC San Diego).

Mathews died on the morning of 21 April 2011 in San Francisco, California of complications from pneumonia. He was 84. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie, his three sons and six grandchildren.

<text>A gold nugget is a naturally occurring piece of native gold. Watercourses often concentrate nuggets and finer gold in placers. Nuggets are recovered by placer mining, but they are also found in residual deposits where the gold-bearing veins or lodes are weathered. Nuggets are also found in the tailings piles of previous mining operations, especially those left by gold mining dredges.

==Formation==

Nuggets are gold fragments weathered out of an original lode. They often show signs of abrasive polishing by stream action, and sometimes still contain inclusions of quartz or other lode matrix material. A 2007 study on Australian nuggets ruled out speculative theories of supergene formation via &quot;in-situ&quot; precipitation, cold welding of smaller particles, or bacterial concentration, since crystal structures of all of the nuggets examined proved they were originally formed at high temperature deep underground (i.e., they were of hypogene origin).

Other precious metals such as platinum form nuggets in the same way. A later study of native gold from Arizona, US, based on lead isotopes indicates that a significant part of the mass in alluvial gold nuggets in this area formed within the placer environment.

==Composition==
Nuggets are usually 20K to 22K purity (83% to 92% by mass). Gold nuggets in Australia often are 23K or slightly higher, while Alaskan nuggets are usually at the lower end of the spectrum. Purity can be roughly assessed by the nugget color, the richer and deeper the orange-yellow the higher the gold content. Nuggets are also referred to by their fineness, for example &quot;865 fine&quot; means the nugget is 865 parts per thousand in gold by mass. The common impurities are silver and copper. Nuggets high in silver content constitute the alloy electrum. The chemical composition of supergene gold nuggets can reveal the characteristics of the primary ore.

==Largest nuggets==
Two gold nuggets are claimed as the largest in the world: the Welcome Stranger and the Canaã nugget, the latter being the largest surviving natural nugget. Considered by most authorities to be the biggest gold nugget ever found, the Welcome Stranger was found at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates. It weighed gross, over and returned over net. The Welcome Stranger is sometimes confused with the similarly named Welcome Nugget, which was found in June 1858 at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, Australia by the Red Hill Mining Company. The Welcome weighed . It was melted down in London in November 1859.

The Canaã nugget, also known as the &quot;Pepita Canaa&quot;, was found on September 13, 1983, by miners at the Serra Pelada Mine in the State of Para, Brazil. Weighing gross, and containing of gold, it is among the largest gold nuggets ever found, and is, today, the largest in existence. The main controversy regarding this nugget is that the excavation reports suggest that the existing nugget was originally part of a nugget weighing that broke during excavations. The Canaã nugget is displayed at the Banco Central Museum in Brazil along with the second and third largest nuggets remaining in existence, weighing respectively and , which were also found at the Serra Pelada region.

The largest gold nugget found using a metal detector is the Hand of Faith, weighing , found in Kingower, Victoria, Australia in 1980.

Historic large specimens include the crystalline &quot;Fricot Nugget&quot;, weighing – the largest one found during the California Gold Rush. It is on display at the California State Mining and Mineral Museum.

The largest gold nugget ever found in California weighed . It was found in August 1869 in Sierra Buttes by five partners – W.A. Farish, A. Wood, J. Winstead, F.N.L. Clevering and Harry Warner.

The Victoria, Australia gold rush of the early 1850s produced a number of large nuggets. They include the Welcome Nugget which weighed which is considered to be the second largest gold nugget ever found. Another find, the Lady Hotham, which weighed , was found by a group of nine miners on September 8, 1854, in Canadian Gully, Ballarat at a depth of 135 feet (41.2 m). The Lady Hotham was named after the wife of the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham who happened to be visiting the area when the nugget was found. Eighteen months earlier, in January and early February 1853, three other large nuggets weighing , , and were also found in Canadian Gully at a depth of . Another nugget, the Heron, was found in 1855 in Golden Gully in the Mount Alexander goldfield. It weighed and was found by a group of inexperienced miners who had received a supposedly empty claim. The miners found the nugget on their second day of digging; the nugget was named after one of the gold commissioners, a Mr. Heron.

On 16 January 2013, a large gold nugget was found near the city of Ballarat in Victoria, Australia by an amateur gold prospector. The Y-shaped nugget weighed slightly more than , measured around 22 cm high by 15 cm wide, and has a market value slightly below 300,000 Australian dollars, though opinions have been expressed that it could be sold for much more due to its rarity. The discovery has cast doubt on the common rumour that Victoria&#x27;s goldfields were exhausted in the 19th century.

<doc id="479805" wikidata="Q1072190" url="?curid=479805" title="Chicken nugget">
<text>A chicken nugget is a food product consisting of a small piece of deboned chicken meat that is breaded or battered, then deep-fried or baked. Developed in the 1950s by finding a way to make a coating adhere, chicken nuggets have become a very popular fast food restaurant item, and are widely sold frozen for home use.

== History ==
The chicken nugget was developed in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented academic work. Bite-sized pieces of chicken, coated in batter and then deep fried, were called &quot;Chicken Crispies&quot; by Baker and his associates. Two problems the meat industry was facing at the time were being able to clump ground meat without a skin and producing a batter coating that could be both deep fried and frozen without becoming detached. Baker&#x27;s innovations solved these problems and made it possible to form chicken nuggets in any shape by first coating the meat in vinegar, salt, grains, and milk powder to make it hold together and then using an egg- and grain-based batter that could be fried as well as frozen.

Dinosaur-shaped (or simply dino) chicken nuggets were first trademarked by Perdue Farms in 1991, and its rise in popularity was possibly assisted by the success of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise.

== Nutritional information ==
Chicken nuggets are generally regarded as a fatty, unhealthy food. A study published in the &quot;American Journal of Medicine&quot; analyzed the composition of chicken nuggets from two American fast food chains. It found that less than half of the material was skeletal muscle, with fat occurring in an equal or greater proportion. Other components included epithelial tissue, bone, nervous tissue and connective tissue. The authors concluded that &quot;Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer.&quot;

== Manufacturing ==

The processing required for making chicken nuggets begins with deboning. The chicken is cut and shaped to the correct size. This is done either manually, or by a series of automatic blades, or by a process called &quot;grinding&quot; (a method of deboning in which the softer parts of the chicken carcass are forced through a mesh, leaving behind the more solid pieces, resulting in a meat paste. If used, this paste is then shaped before battering). The pieces are battered and breaded in a large cylindrical drum that rotates, evenly coating all of the pieces in the desired spices and breading. The pieces are then fried in oil until the batter has set and the outside reaches the desired color. Finally, the nuggets are packaged, frozen and stored for shipping. While specific ingredients and production methods may vary between manufacturers, the above practices hold true for most of the industry.

==In popular culture==
Chicken nuggets have been the subject of food challenges, social media phenomena, and many more forms of public notoriety. The dish has inspired gourmet restaurants, exercise routines, and even feature-length productions, including &quot;Cooties&quot;, a movie about a grade school child who eats a chicken nugget infected with a virus that turns prepubescent children into zombies. Thomas Welborn holds the world record for eating the most chicken nuggets in three minutes (746 grams, or approximately 42 chicken nuggets).

On Twitter, the most retweeted tweet of 2017 was made by Carter Wilkerson who asked Wendy&#x27;s what it would take for them to offer him a year of free nuggets. The tweet generated over 3.5 million retweets.

The largest recorded chicken nugget weighed and was long and wide and was created by Empire Kosher. It was unveiled at Kosherfest in Secaucus, New Jersey on October 29, 2013.

== Vegan nuggets ==

Vegan &quot;chicken&quot; nuggets are made with plant-based ingredients entered the market in recent years. They are sold by major retailers as vegan chicken nuggets and made from ingredients that include pea protein, soy protein, textured vegetable protein, and wheat gluten. Companies such as Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Morningstar Farms, and Simulate sell vegan chicken nuggets. In 2019, McDonald&#x27;s trialed vegan McNuggets made of chickpeas and potatoes in Norway. Swedish fast food restaurant Max Hamburgare offers a dish containing nuggets made of falafel. Quorn also supplies vegetarian chicken-like nuggets derived from fungus. In 2022, KFC began serving vegan chicken nuggets at its 4,000 U.S. locations.

In 2022, Michele Simon wrote in &quot;Forbes&quot; that there were more than 20 brands selling vegan chicken nuggets. In 2022, Avery Yale Kamila said in the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; that because young people are the most interested in vegan food, it was not surprising that &quot;vegan foods associated with childhood, such as hot dogs and chicken nuggets, would be the first to partner with youth-oriented TV shows and movies.&quot; Vegan &quot;chicken&quot; nuggets have been taste-tested, for example in 2021 by &quot;Culture Map Dallas&quot; and in 2022 by &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;.

<doc id="479814" wikidata="Q2060306" url="?curid=479814" title="Red Cloud's War">
<text>Red Cloud&#x27;s War (also referred to as the Bozeman War or the Powder River War) was an armed conflict between an alliance of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Northern Arapaho peoples against the United States and the Crow Nation that took place in the Wyoming and Montana territories from 1866 to 1868. The war was fought over control of the western Powder River Country in present day north-central Wyoming and Montana.

In 1863, European Americans had blazed the Bozeman Trail through the heart of the traditional territory of the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota. It was the shortest and easiest route from Fort Laramie and the Oregon Trail to the Montana gold fields. From 1864 to 1866, the trail was traversed by about 3,500 miners, emigrant settlers and others, who competed with the Indians for the diminishing resources near the trail.

The United States named the war after Red Cloud, a prominent Oglala Lakota chief allied with the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The United States army had built forts in response to attacks on civilian travelers, using a treaty right to &quot;establish roads, military and other post&quot;. All three forts were located in 1851 Crow Indian territory and accepted by these Indians. The Crow believed they guarded their interests best by cooperating with the US army.

Red Cloud&#x27;s War consisted mostly of constant small-scale Indian raids and attacks on the soldiers and civilians at the three forts in the Powder River country, wearing down those garrisons. The largest action of the war, the Fetterman Fight (with 81 men killed on the U.S. side), was the worst military defeat suffered by the U.S. on the Great Plains until the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian reservation ten years later. &quot; ... the most dramatic battles between the army and the Dakota [in the 1860s and 1870s] were on lands those Indians had taken from other tribes since 1851.&quot;

With peace achieved under the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868, the Lakota and their allies were victorious. They gained legal control of the western Powder River country, took down the forts and permanently closed the Bozeman trail. The Crow lost their hunting grounds in the Powder River region to their enemies. With the treaty, &quot;... the [United States] government had in effect betrayed the Crows, who had willingly helped the army to hold the posts for two years&quot;. The victory of the Lakota and their allies endured for eight years until the Great Sioux War of 1876, when the US resumed taking their territories, including the sacred Black Hills. In a 1980 Supreme Court case, &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot;, the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018 this amounted to more than $1 billion.

==Background==

As early as 1805, a Crow camp allowed French-Canadian fur trader François Antoine Larocque to follow it across parts of the Powder River area. According to him, the Crow &quot;... inhabit the Eastern part of the Rocky Mountains at the head of the Rivière aux Roches Jaunes (Yellowstone River) and its Branches, Bighorn River, Tongue River, Powder River and others and Close to the head of the Missouri&quot;.

From the late 17th century, the Lakota had been moving west into the Plains, enlarging their territory so that by the early 19th century, they controlled the mid-Missouri River region.
Cheyenne and Lakota warriors committed a carnage on a big Crow camp at Tongue River in 1820, known today as the Tongue River Massacre, making their enmity permanent. In 1843, United States explorer John Frémont said that Lakota had told him that they would soon fight the Crow and take their land, as the Crow country had about the best bison range in the west.

In 1851, the area in question was included in a treaty with the United States for the first time, namely in the Fort Laramie treaty. This peace agreement defined territories for the tribes, in an effort by the US to establish peace among Native tribes and protect its own settlers. The treaty was signed by representatives of some factions of the numerous tribes of the Plains and mountainous West, including Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho; Gros Ventre, Mandan, and Arikara; Assiniboine and other nations. Intertribal warfare had been common among the tribes to gain social and economic advantages in furs, slaves, horses, hunting grounds, and other interests. They continued to wage war against each other into the late 19th century, conducting affairs separate from interaction with US forces and representatives.

As the big game dwindled in the mid-1850s, the Lakota began to enlarge their hunting grounds and encroached and &quot;ignored the boundaries&quot; of the 1851 treaty. They crossed Powder River (the dividing line between the Lakota territory and that of the Crow) and launched their &quot;own program for expansions&quot; westward at the expense of other Natives. For the Crow, the plains near present-day Wyola, Montana became a field for &quot;large-scale battles with invading Sioux&quot;. By 1860, the Lakota and their allies had driven the Crows away from their treaty-guaranteed hunting grounds on the west side of the Powder River.

The Lakota winter count by Ben Kindle (Oglala) reflects the fighting between the Crow and the Oglala during these decisive years. In five out of eight &quot;winters&quot; (years) from 1857 to 1864, he refers to Oglala triumphs over the Crow or the reverse. The year 1857 is remembered for a battle in which &quot;The Sioux killed ten Crow Indians.&quot; In an 1863 fight, &quot;The Crow killed eight Oglala Sioux.&quot;

The discovery of gold in 1863 around Bannack, Montana was a catalyst for white settlers to find an economical route to the gold fields. While some emigrants went to Salt Lake City and then north to Montana, pioneer John Bozeman and John M Jacobs developed the Bozeman Trail from Fort Laramie north through the Powder River country east of the Bighorn Mountains to the Yellowstone, then westward over what is now Bozeman Pass. &quot;It is apparent that the great northern routes of travel to and from Montana, both by land and water, lie through the country of the Crow Indians...&quot; established the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1867. However, the Lakotas &quot;had gradually driven the Crows back upon the headwaters of the Yellowstone&quot;, and now they claimed &quot;as a conquest almost the entire country traversed by what is called the Powder River route [Bozeman Trail] ...&quot;. The trail passed through the Powder River hunting grounds of the Lakota or Western (Teton) Sioux. A second trail, the Bridger Trail, passed west of the Bighorns but was longer and therefore less favored.

The Powder River country encompasses the numerous rivers (the Bighorn, Rosebud, Tongue and Powder) that flow northeastward from the Bighorn Mountains to the Yellowstone. The Cheyenne had been the first tribe in this area, followed by bands of Lakota. As more of the northern plains became occupied by white settlement, this region became the last unspoiled hunting ground of the Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho and several of the seven bands of the Lakota.The treaty breaking annexation of the Crow&#x27;s Powder River area in the 1850s by the Lakotas was the basis for Red Cloud&#x27;s War against the United States on exactly the same soil a decade later. The United States vs. the Lakota was a conflict between &quot;... two expanding empires, with the most dramatic battles occurring on lands only recently taken by the Sioux from other tribes&quot;.
In 1865, Maj. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge ordered the Powder River Expedition against the Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho. Three columns of soldiers numbering 2,675 men, commanded by Patrick E. Connor, moved into the Powder River country. The expedition failed to defeat the Indians in any decisive battles, although it destroyed an Arapaho village at the Battle of the Tongue River. The expedition was a failure in most respects as Lakota Indian resistance to white emigrants traveling the Bozeman Trail became more determined than ever.

After the Powder River Expedition, the U.S. attempted to negotiate safe passage for settlers through Indian territory. In autumn 1865, it negotiated several treaties with Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho leaders. The treaties provided monetary compensation to the Indians in exchange for their agreement to withdraw from the overland routes, established and to be established, in the Powder River country. However, the signatories to these treaties were &quot;Laramie loafers&quot;—Indians who lived near Fort Laramie and lived off handouts. For a treaty to be effective, the Indians who had fought Connor, especially Red Cloud, had to be engaged. No white man could be found to undertake a dangerous mission to find Red Cloud and bring him to Fort Laramie for negotiations, so several of the &quot;loafers&quot; took the task. On March 12, 1866, Red Cloud and his Oglala rode into Fort Laramie. Red Cloud committed to remain peacefully at the Fort until such time as the U.S.&#x27;s chief negotiator, E. B. Taylor, arrived with presents for the assembled Indians.

Crows such as Wolf Bow tried to push the whites to take action against the Indian intruders: &quot;Put the Sioux Indians in their own country, and keep them from troubling us. Don&#x27;t stop fighting them&quot;. When possible, the Crow warned the troops of imminent attacks from hostile Indians and they joined soldiers in fending off attempts to capture horses. The strikes and attacks on the soldiers by the Lakota &quot;... appeared to be a great Sioux war to protect their land. And it was but the Sioux had only recently conquered this land from other tribes and now defending the territory both from other tribes and from the advance of white settlers&quot;.

==Council at Fort Laramie==

Negotiations between Red Cloud and other Native American leaders and the United States&#x27; representatives began in June 1866. On June 13, however, with the worst possible timing, Colonel Henry B. Carrington commanding the 18th Infantry, arrived at Laramie with the two battalions of the regiment (approximately 1,300 men in 16 companies) and construction supplies. He had orders to establish forts in the Powder River country using the 2nd Battalion of the 18th Infantry. The 3rd Battalion was to garrison posts along the old Oregon Trail, now the Platte Road. Carrington chose the 2nd Battalion because it contained 220 veteran soldiers consolidated after the American Civil War. When Carrington appeared at the negotiations the following day, Red Cloud refused to acknowledge him and accused the U.S. of bad faith in the negotiations. Red Cloud, They Fear Even His Horses, and others withdrew from the negotiations and departed Fort Laramie.Negotiations continued with a reduced number of Indian leaders. The US offered a substantial inducement for their cooperation: 70,000 dollars per year for the Lakota and 15,000 dollars per year for the Cheyenne. The Indians may have learned that the US often failed to deliver on its promises in treaties for annuities. On June 29, Taylor reported to Washington that a treaty had been concluded and that a &quot;most cordial feeling prevails&quot; between white and Indian. He said that only about 300 warriors, led by Red Cloud, objected to the treaty. The US government expressed optimism that the treaty would be successful in keeping the peace. In December, President Andrew Johnson in his State of the Union address said that the Indians had &quot;unconditionally submitted to our authority and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations.&quot; Unbeknownst to Johnson, Carrington at that time was under virtual siege by the Indians at Fort Phil Kearny.

The agreement was not ratified. The United States, as signer of the 1851 Fort Laramie treaty, could only undertake meaningful negotiations about the western Powder River plains with the legitimate holder of the area, the Crow tribe.

==Opposing forces==
Carrington left Fort Laramie for the Powder River Country on June 17, 1866. He led 700 soldiers, 300 civilians, including wives and children of soldiers, and civilian contractors; 226 wagons full of supplies, a 35-man regimental band, and 1,000 head of cattle for a supply of fresh meat. The number of soldiers reflected the reductions that had been made in the army since the Civil War. Previous military expeditions against the Sioux by Alfred Sully, Henry Hastings Sibley, and Patrick Edward Connor from 1863 to 1865 had numbered more than 2,000 soldiers.

Five hundred of Carrington&#x27;s men were new recruits and most were infantry, rather than cavalry. He had much less ammunition than the 100,000 rounds promised him. Carrington&#x27;s men were armed with muzzle-loading Springfield rifles from the Civil War rather than new, faster-firing Spencer carbines and breech loading rifles. He had been &quot;equipped with the men, arms, and supplies to build and garrison forts, not to wage war with an active army.&quot;

Carrington did not use Indian scouts, but they could have provided him essential intelligence on his opponents and informed him of a mobile search-and-destroy attack force. Nearly all of the meager successes of the Powder River Expedition a year earlier were attributable to the Pawnee and Omaha scouts who had accompanied the expedition. A scout in another Indian war would say of US soldiers, &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s boys are too slow for this kind of work.&quot; Carrington&#x27;s guide was the seasoned Mountain man Jim Bridger.

Carrington&#x27;s opponents, the migratory hunting and warrior societies of the Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho, had advantages in mobility, horsemanship, knowledge of the country, guerrilla hit-and-run tactics, and the capability to concentrate their forces to achieve numerical superiority. They also had many weaknesses as a fighting force, especially in organization and weapons. During winter and spring, the scarcity of natural resources resulted in their living in small, scattered autonomous groups. In late summer and fall they congregated into large encampments for ceremonies and to make political decisions and plan collective action. Bands were highly decentralized and individual Indians felt little obligation to obey group decisions. The Lakota consisted of seven independent bands, each made up of numerous sub-bands, all of whom operated independently. The Cheyenne had a more structured and centralized political organization.

Some historians have estimated that Red Cloud&#x27;s warriors numbered up to 4,000 men. The total number of Lakota in 1865 was about 13,860. The Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho numbered about 3,000, adding up to a total of about 17,000 Indian men, women, and children. Thousands of people in all three of those tribes were not in the Powder River country with Red Cloud; others stayed aloof from warfare. As had been typical of United States militias, Indian men were part-time warriors. They had to spend much of summer and fall each year hunting buffalo and other game to feed their families. In the late winter and spring, they were limited in mobility until the grass turned green and their horses could recover their strength after the severe winters of the northern Great Plains. The effectiveness of Indian forces were diminished by their lack of cohesion and organization.

The Indians had few guns and little ammunition; only six of the 81 soldiers who were later killed in the Fetterman Fight had gunshot wounds, and two of those may have shot themselves accidentally. Their basic weapon was the bow and arrow. The short (usually less than four feet long) and stout Indian bow was designed for short-distance hunting from horseback. Although deadly at short range, it probably had less than one-half the range of the English longbow, which was effective to 200 yards (180 m). Indian warriors lacked the capability to do significant damage to their opponents at ranges of more than 100 yards (90 m). By contrast, the soldier&#x27;s Springfield Model 1861 muskets had an effective range of 300 yards or more. The Springfield musket, however, had a much lower rate of fire than the bow, offsetting to an extent its range advantage.
==War==
Carrington and his caravan reached Fort Reno on June 28, and left two companies (about 100 men) there to relieve the two companies of the 5th U.S. Volunteers (nicknamed the &quot;Galvanized Yankees&quot;), who had garrisoned the fort over the winter. Proceeding north, on July 14, Carrington founded Fort Phil Kearny on Piney Creek, near present-day Buffalo, Wyoming.

From there two companies of the 18th advanced 91 miles to the northwest, where on August 13, they established a third post, Fort C. F. Smith on the Bighorn River. Given the typically early and severe winters of the high plains, the middle of August was very late in the year to begin constructing forts, but Carrington&#x27;s march had been slowed by having to transport a large mechanical &quot;grass-cutting machine.&quot; With replacements and reinforcements, Carrington&#x27;s total force did not much exceed 700, of whom 400 were located at Fort Kearny.

Carrington was an engineer and political appointee, inexperienced in combat. He spent manpower resources building superior fortifications. Arriving in the region in mid-July, he tried to prepare for winter. Given the severity of the Wyoming winters, this was reasonable, but many of his junior officers, anxious for battle, were infuriated. Most were Civil War veterans, but they were unfamiliar with Indian fighting and believed the warriors could be easily defeated.

On July 16, a group of Cheyenne, including Dull Knife and Two Moons, visited Carrington at Fort Reno and proclaimed their desire for peace. They said that Red Cloud was nearby with 500 warriors. Two white civilians were killed that day, and the Lakota campaign against the forts along the Trail began the next day. Red Cloud&#x27;s warriors infiltrated the picket lines near the fort and stampeded 175 horses and mules. About 200 soldiers pursued the Indians in a running 15 mile fight, attempting unsuccessfully to recover the animals and suffering two men killed and three wounded. Returning to the fort, they found the bodies of six civilian traders killed by the Indians.

On July 20, Red Cloud&#x27;s warriors attacked a wagon train of 37 soldiers and civilians, killing two, at Crazy Woman Fork of the Powder River. After they attacked other civilian wagon trains, nearly all civilian traffic on the Bozeman Trail ceased. Carrington could only be re-supplied with food and ammunition by heavily guarded wagon trains. In the weeks and months that followed, the Indians repeatedly attacked the wagon trains that sallied out of Fort Kearny to cut construction timber in a forest six miles away. For defense, the wood trains were large, consisting of two parallel lines of 24 to 40 wagons guarded by mounted soldiers on either flank. In the event of an attack, the wagons were quickly drawn into a corral for defense. Fifteen Indian attacks near Fort Kearny between July 16 and September 27 resulted in the deaths of 6 soldiers and 28 civilians and the loss of several hundred horses, mules, and cattle. Carrington&#x27;s hay-cutting machine was also destroyed.

===Battle of the Hundred Slain/Fetterman Fight===

In November 1866, Captains William J. Fetterman and James Powell arrived at Fort Phil Kearny from the 18th Infantry&#x27;s headquarters garrison at Fort Laramie to replace several officers recently relieved of duty. Unlike Carrington, Fetterman had extensive combat experience during the Civil War, but he lacked experience fighting Native Americans. Fetterman disagreed with Carrington&#x27;s strategy, reportedly saying it was &quot;passive&quot; and boasting that given &quot;80 men,&quot; he &quot;would ride through the Sioux nation.&quot; Later, Carrington reported these boasts while trying to defend his own reputation.

On December 6, a force of Company C, 2nd Cavalry tasked to protect a wood train, was attacked by Red Cloud. Commanding officer Second Lieutenant Horace S. Bingham was among those killed as he had followed them as they retreated over Lodge Trail Ridge and been overwhelmed. Carrington worried about his officers&#x27; tendency to follow blindly such Indian decoy parties. Fetterman was outraged by what he considered the ineffectiveness of Carrington&#x27;s leadership. He understood the commander of the Department of the Platte, Gen. Philip St. George Cooke, to have ordered the garrison to mount an aggressive winter campaign.
On the morning of December 21, 1866, the wood train was attacked again. Carrington ordered a relief party composed of 49 infantrymen of the 18th Infantry, 27 mounted troopers of the 2nd Cavalry, with Captain James Powell to command. Powell had led a similar effort two days earlier and declined to pursue the Indians over the ridge. However, by claiming seniority as a brevet lieutenant colonel, Fetterman asked for and was given command of the relief party. Powell remained behind. Another officer of the 18th, Lt. George W. Grummond, also a vocal critic of Carrington, led the cavalry, which had been leaderless since Lt. Bingham&#x27;s death in early December. Captain Frederick Brown, until recently the post quartermaster and another of Carrington&#x27;s critics, and two civilians, James Wheatley and Isaac Fisher, joined Fetterman, bringing the relief force up to 81 officers and men. The infantry marched out first; the cavalry had to retrieve its mounts before it could follow and catch up.
Colonel Carrington said he ordered Fetterman not to cross Lodge Trail Ridge, where relief from the fort would be difficult, and that he told Grummond to remind Fetterman of his order. Upon leaving the fort, Fetterman, instead of marching down the wood road to the relief of the wood train, turned north and crossed the Sullivant Hills toward Lodge Trail Ridge. Within a few minutes of their departure, a Lakota decoy party including Oglala warrior Crazy Horse appeared on Lodge Trail Ridge. Fetterman took the bait; several of the warriors stood on their ponies and insultingly waggled their bare buttocks at the troopers. Fetterman and his company were joined by Grummond at the crossing of the creek; they deployed in skirmish line and marched over the Ridge in pursuit. They raced into the Peno Valley, where an estimated 1,000–3,000 Indians were concealed. They had fought the soldiers there on December 6.

The ambush was not observed from the fort, but around noon, men at the fort heard gunfire, beginning with a few shots followed immediately by sustained firing. When the Oglala and Cheyenne sprang their trap, the soldiers had no escape; none survived. Evidence indicated the cavalry probably had charged the Indians; the bodies of the cavalry&#x27;s most advanced group were found nearly a mile down the ridge beyond the infantry.

Reports from the burial party sent to collect the remains said the soldiers had died in three groups. The most advanced, and probably most effective, were the two civilians, armed with 16-shot Henry repeating rifles, and a small number of cavalrymen who had dismounted and taken cover in the rocks. Up the slope behind them were the bodies of most of the retreating cavalrymen, armed with new 7-shot Spencer carbines, but encumbered by their horses and lacking cover. Further up the slope were Fetterman, Brown, and the infantrymen. They had nearly obsolete Civil War muzzle-loading muskets; the Indians were armed with equally obsolete weaponry. These foot soldiers fought from cover for a short while, until their ammunition ran out and they were overrun.

Carrington heard the gunfire and immediately sent out a 40-man support force on foot under Captain Tenedor Ten Eyck. Shortly after, the 30 remaining cavalrymen of Company C were sent dismounted to reinforce Ten Eyck, followed by two wagons, the first loaded with hastily loaded ammunition and escorted by another 40 men. Carrington called for an immediate muster of troops to defend the post. Including the wood train detail, the detachments had left only 119 troops remaining inside the fort.

Ten Eyck took a roundabout route and reached the ridgetop just as the firing ceased about 12:45 p.m. He sent back a message reporting that he could not see Fetterman&#x27;s force, but the valley was filled with groups of Indians taunting him to come down. Ten Eyck suffered severe criticism for not marching straight to battle, though doing so would have resulted only in the destruction of his force, too. Ten Eyck reached and recovered the bodies of Fetterman&#x27;s men. Because of continuing Indian threat, they could not recover those of the cavalry for two days.

By that time, Fetterman and his entire 81-man detachment were dead. Carrington&#x27;s official report said that Fetterman and Brown shot each other to avoid capture. Army autopsies recorded Fetterman&#x27;s death wound as a knife slash. It remains a subject of debate. The warriors mutilated most of the bodies of the soldiers. Most of the dead soldiers were scalped, beheaded, dismembered, disemboweled, and often castrated, facts widely publicized by the newspapers. The only body left untouched was that of a young teenage bugler, Adolph Metzler. He was believed to have fought several Indians with just his bugle as a bludgeon. Aside from his fatal head and chest injuries, his body was left untouched and covered with a buffalo robe by the Indians. The reason for this remains unknown.
This battle was called the &quot;Battle of the Hundred Slain&quot; or the &quot;Battle of the Hundred in the Hand&quot; by the Indians and the &quot;Fetterman Massacre&quot; by the soldiers. It was the Army&#x27;s worst defeat on the Great Plains until the Little Big Horn battle nearly ten years later.

===After the Fetterman Fight===

The evening after the Fetterman disaster, a civilian, John &quot;Portugee&quot; Philips, volunteered to carry a distress message to Fort Laramie. Carrington&#x27;s message to General Cooke reported Fetterman&#x27;s defeat and requested immediate reinforcements and supplies of repeating Spencer carbines. Philips accomplished the ride to Fort Laramie in four days. A blizzard began on December 22, and Philips rode through a foot (30 cm) of snow and temperatures below . He did not see any Indians during his ride. He arrived at Fort Laramie late in the evening on December 25, during a full-dress Christmas ball. He staggered, exhausted, into the party to deliver his message.

General Cooke immediately relieved Carrington of command, replacing him with Brigadier General Henry W. Wessells. Wessells arrived safely at Fort Kearny on January 16 with two companies of cavalry and four of infantry. One man in his command froze to death during the journey. Carrington left Fort Kearny on January 23 with his wife and the other women and children, including the pregnant wife of the deceased Lt. Grummond, and braved temperatures as low as during the journey to Fort Laramie. One half of his 60-soldier escort suffered frostbite. General Ulysses S. Grant, commanding the U.S. Army, was not inclined to blame only Carrington. He relieved Cooke on January 9, 1867. Both an Army court of inquiry and the Secretary of the Interior investigated the Fetterman Fight. The Army reached no official conclusion, and Interior exonerated Carrington. After a severe hip injury, Carrington resigned his commission in 1870. He spent the rest of his life defending his actions and condemning Fetterman&#x27;s alleged disobedience.

After the Fetterman Fight, the Indians dispersed into smaller groups for the 1866–1867 winter. Conflict subsided for the season. Wessells and his men at Fort Phil Kearny had a difficult time through the winter. Food was short, most of the horses and mules died from lack of forage, and scurvy was common among the soldiers. He cancelled plans for a punitive winter campaign against the Indians. In April, Indians began raids along the Oregon Trail in the North Platte River valley. Journalist Henry M. Stanley, (later achieving fame in Africa), said, &quot;Murders are getting to be so tame from their plurality, that no one pays any attention to them.&quot;

Most serious was the Indian threat to the construction of the first transcontinental railroad routed through southern Wyoming. Although army forces had been augmented along the Bozeman Trail and at Fort Laramie in the wake of the Fetterman disaster, resources were still insufficient to take the offensive against the Indians. Peace negotiations conducted by the friendly Lakota chieftain Spotted Tail with Red Cloud initially seemed promising, but proved to be only a delaying tactic by the Indians. The Lakota held their annual Sun Dance in July, delaying the renewal of major hostilities.

===Hayfield and Wagon Box fights===

In late July 1867, the Lakota and Cheyenne took two different paths in attacks. A force composed primarily of Cheyenne and Arapaho gathered for an attack at Fort C. F. Smith on the Bighorn River in Montana. Another, mostly Lakota, decided to attack Fort Phil Kearny, southeast. Crow people lived near Fort Smith and provided intelligence to the soldiers at the fort, warning of upcoming attacks. On July 23, the fort was reinforced by two companies of infantry under Lt. Col. Luther P. Bradley, bringing the complement of the fort up to 350 soldiers.

Most importantly, the reinforcements were armed with breech-loading Springfield Model 1866 rifles, replacing the muskets the soldiers had previously been issued. The new rifles had a rate of fire of 8 to 10 shots per minute compared to 3 to 4 for the muzzle-loading muskets; also, they could be easily reloaded by men lying in a prone position.

The supply of the new Springfields was perhaps the biggest change in the conflict since the Fetterman Fight. They allowed the soldiers to reload quickly, ending the Indian tactic of charging defenses before the soldiers could reload. With the new rifles, the soldiers could also remain behind cover while reloading.

The soldiers at Fort Smith were tasked with protecting civilians cutting hay for winter food for the fort&#x27;s horses. On the morning of August 1, 21 soldiers and 9 civilians were working in the hayfield from Fort Smith, when several hundred mounted Indians charged them; the soldiers and civilians took cover behind logs in a makeshift fort and in rifle pits. During the course of the day, the Americans repulsed several attacks with their fast-firing rifles. The Indians broke off the attack in the afternoon. American casualties were two soldiers and one civilian killed and three wounded. The Indians claimed they had lost eight dead; the soldiers estimated they had killed 18 to 23.

The Wagon Box Fight near Fort Kearny the next day was similar. Twenty-six soldiers and 6 civilians were escorting a wood-cutting detail outside the fort. The heavy wooden boxes of 14 wagons had been placed on the ground in an oval corral near the main cutting site, and most of the soldiers and civilians took refuge there when hundreds of mounted Indian warriors suddenly appeared. Armed with the new breech-loading rifles, the Americans held off the Indians for six hours before being rescued by a relief force from Fort Kearny. Three Americans were killed and two wounded in the corral, and four woodcutters were killed about away. The Wagon Box Fight was hailed at the time as the &quot;greatest Indian battle in the world,&quot; with Indian casualties fancifully estimated at up to 1,500. Historian George E. Hyde has said the Indians had 6 killed and 6 wounded and did not regard the fight as a defeat, as they captured a large number of mules and horses. Many years later Red Cloud claimed not to remember the Wagon Box Fight, although given the large number of Indians engaged that seems unlikely.

The outcomes of the Hayfield and Wagon Box fights discouraged the Indians from mounting additional large-scale attacks, but they continued harassment of the forts along the Bozeman Trail, killing soldiers and civilians. On August 7 the Indians attacked a Union Pacific Railroad train at Plum Creek near present-day Lexington, Nebraska, far from the Powder River Country and in a region considered by the US to be peaceful until then. This alarmed the government.

==Treaty of Fort Laramie==

Despite the military successes in the Hayfield and Wagon Box Fights, the U.S. government increasingly sought a peaceful rather than a military solution to Red Cloud&#x27;s War. The successful completion of the transcontinental railroad took priority, and the Army did not have the resources to defend both the railroad and the Bozeman Trail from Indian attacks. The military presence in the Powder River Country was both expensive and unproductive, with estimates that 20,000 soldiers might be needed to subdue the Indians.

Peace commissioners were sent to Fort Laramie in the spring of 1868. Red Cloud refused to meet with them until the Army abandoned the Powder River forts, Phil Kearny, C. F. Smith, and Reno. In August 1868, Federal soldiers abandoned the forts and withdrew to Fort Laramie. The day after the soldiers left the forts, the Indians burned them. The Bozeman Trail was closed for all time.

Red Cloud did not arrive at Fort Laramie until November. He signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868, which created the Great Sioux Reservation, including the Black Hills. The reservation included all of South Dakota west of the Missouri River. Northern Arapaho representatives also signed the treaty. The treaty declared the Powder River country as &quot;unceded Indian territory&quot;, as a reserve for the Indians who chose not to live on the new reservation, and as a hunting reserve for the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. The treaty also accorded the Lakota Indians continued hunting rights in western Kansas and eastern Colorado, along with other peoples such as the Pawnees. These far, southern hunting grounds along the forks of Republican River remained holdings of the United States, as they had been since 1833, when the Pawnee Indians sold this area and other parts of their country to the whites. Most importantly, the treaty specified what Red Cloud sought: &quot;no white person or persons shall be permitted to settle upon or occupy any portion&quot; of the Powder River country &quot;or without the consent of the Indians first had and obtained, to pass through&quot; the Powder River country.

The Lakotas on their part allowed the construction of &quot;any railroad&quot; outside the reservation. They would give up &quot;all right to occupy permanently the territory outside&quot; it and &quot;regard said reservation their permanent home&quot;. They accepted &quot;not to attack any persons at home, or travelling ...&quot;.

Although a treaty between the United States and the Lakotas, it had profound consequences for the Crows. In order to realize the Lakota demand to the western Powder River area, the United States first had to buy it from the 1851 treaty right holder, the Crow, and then recognize the Lakota tribe as the next proprietor. Consequently, parallel with the negotiations with the Lakota, the United States had treaty talks with the Crow Indians. On May 7, 1868, the Crows accepted to sell large parts of their 1851 treaty territory to the United States. The ceded area included the western Powder River hunting grounds of the Crow, already for years taken in possession by the Lakotas and their allies without consent. The Crows also agreed to settle on a smaller reservation right on the south side of the Yellowstone, in the center of their 1851 territory. The Crow reservation included &quot;The Valley of Chieftains&quot;, to the whites known as the valley of Little Bighorn River.

The small Ponca tribe was another Indian nation affected by the new Fort Laramie treaty. By mistake, the United States had given the Lakotas treaty right to the reservation of the Poncas.

==Aftermath==
Lakota Indian sovereignty over the Powder River country endured for eight years until renewed US interest in Great Sioux Reservation land due to the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, leading to the Great Sioux War of 1876 and violations of the treaty. In a 1980 Supreme Court case, &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot;, the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018 this amounted to more than $1 billion.

The peace of 1868 forced upon the whites allowed the Oglalas and other Lakotas to turn their focus on the intertribal wars again. In November, chief Red Cloud asked the United States for firearms to fight the Crows after the loss of two band members. The Lakotas also &quot;continued their destructive raids&quot; against the Poncas, &quot;resentful of the Poncas living on what was now Sioux land&quot;. While using their new treaty right to hunt along the Republican River in United States&#x27; territory in the summer of 1873, two big Lakota camps made a large-scale attack on a travelling group of Pawnees in what has ever since been called the Massacre Canyon.

After 1868, Red Cloud lived on the reservation. Seeing that the numbers of new emigrants and technology of the United States would overwhelm the Sioux, Red Cloud adapted to fighting the US Indian Bureau for fair treatment for his people. He was an important leader of the Lakota through the years of transition from their plains culture to the relative confinement of the reservation system. He outlived all the major Lakota leaders of the Indian wars. He lived until 1909, when he died on the Pine Ridge Reservation and was buried there.

Fetterman, Brown and the U.S. soldiers killed in the 1866 Fetterman Fight were reinterred at the U.S. National Cemetery at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, near Crow Agency, Montana.

<text>The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II (&quot;Ramesses the Great&quot;, also spelled &quot;Ramses&quot; and &quot;Rameses&quot;). It is located in the Theban Necropolis in Upper Egypt, on the west of the River Nile, across from the modern city of Luxor. The name – or at least its French form Rhamesséion – was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses&#x27;s names and titles on the walls. It was originally called the &quot;House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon.&quot; Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II.

== History ==
Ramesses II modified, usurped, or constructed many buildings from the ground up, and the most splendid of these, in accordance with New Kingdom royal burial practices, would have been his memorial temple: a place of worship dedicated to pharaoh, god on earth, where his memory would have been kept alive after his death. Surviving records indicate that work on the project began shortly after the start of his reign and continued for 20 years.

The design of Ramesses&#x27;s mortuary temple adheres to the standard canons of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple itself comprised two stone pylons (gateways, some wide), one after the other, each leading into a courtyard. Beyond the second courtyard, at the centre of the complex, was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary. An enormous pylon stood before the first court, with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back. As was customary, the pylons and outer walls were decorated with scenes commemorating the pharaoh&#x27;s military victories and leaving due record of his dedication to, and kinship with, the gods. In Ramesses&#x27;s case, much importance is placed on the Battle of Kadesh (ca. 1274 BC); more intriguingly, however, one block atop the first pylon records his pillaging, in the eighth year of his reign, a city called &quot;Shalem&quot;, which may or may not have been Jerusalem. The scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before Kadesh, as portrayed in the canons of the &quot;epic poem of Pentaur&quot;, can still be seen on the pylon.

Only fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh, high and weighing more than 1000 tons. This was alleged to have been transported over land. This is the largest remaining colossal statue (except statues done &quot;in situ&quot;) in the world. However, fragments of four granite colossi of Ramesses were found in Tanis (northern Egypt) with an estimated height of . Like four of the six colossi of Amenhotep III (Colossi of Memnon), there are no longer complete remains, so the heights are based on unconfirmed estimates.
Remains of the second court include part of the internal façade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right. Scenes of war and the rout of the Hittites at Kadesh are repeated on the walls. In the upper registers, are shown a feast in honour of the phallic god Min, god of fertility. On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still left furnish an idea of the original grandeur. Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king which once flanked the entrance to the temple can also be seen, one in pink granite and the other in black granite. The head of one of these has been removed to the British Museum. Thirty-nine out of the forty-eight columns in the great hypostyle hall, which is , still stand in the central rows. They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various gods. Part of the ceiling, decorated with gold stars on a blue, ground has also been preserved. The sons and daughters of Ramesses appear in the procession on the few walls left. The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms, with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell. Part of the first room, with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes, and a few remains of the second room are all that is left.

Adjacent to the north of the hypostyle hall was a smaller temple; this was dedicated to Ramesses&#x27;s mother, Tuya, and to his beloved chief wife, Nefertari. To the south of the first courtyard stood the temple palace. The complex was surrounded by various storerooms, granaries, workshops, and other ancillary buildings, some built as late as Roman times.

A temple of Seti I, of which nothing is now left but the foundations, once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall. It consisted of a peristyle court with two chapel shrines. The entire complex was surrounded by mudbrick walls which started at the gigantic southeast pylon.

A cache of papyri and ostraca dating back to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 8th centuries BC) indicates that the temple was also the site of an important scribal school.

The site was in use before Ramesses had the first stone put in place: beneath the hypostyle hall, modern archaeologists have found a shaft tomb from the Middle Kingdom, yielding a rich hoard of religious and funerary artefacts.

==Remains==

Unlike the massive stone temples that Ramesses ordered carved from the face of the Nubian mountains at Abu Simbel, the inexorable passage of three millennia was not kind to his &quot;temple of a million years&quot; at Thebes. This was mostly due to its location on the very edge of the Nile floodplain, with the annual inundation gradually undermining the foundations of this temple and its neighbours. Neglect and the arrival of new faiths also took their toll: for example, in the early years of the Christian Era, the temple was put into service as a Christian church.

This is all standard fare for a temple of its kind built at that time. Leaving aside the escalation of scale – whereby each successive New Kingdom pharaoh strove to outdo his predecessors in volume and scope – the Ramesseum is largely cast in the same mould as the ruined temple of Amenhotep III that stood behind the &quot;Colossi of Memnon&quot; a kilometre or so away, and Ramesses III&#x27;s Medinet Habu which closely followed the plan of the Ramesseum. Instead, the significance that the Ramesseum enjoys today owes more to the time and manner of its rediscovery by Europeans.

The Ramesseum king list is a minor list of kings which still remain in situ on the few remains of the second pylon.

== Storage ==

The storerooms surround the temple on three sides, forming three groups, with the oldest behind the temple. The site is notable for its true arches made of mud bricks that were not wedge-shaped as proper voussoirs, but simply held in place by mortar and thus prone to collapse, leaving very few examples still standing. Ramesseum has the oldest such arch still standing in Egypt ().

Each granary in the oldest group was approximately in length, wide and high, with a bottom wall thickness of . The springing level of a barrel vault at the height of approximately , with arcs build as four courses of mud bricks in size.

==Excavation and studies==

The origins of modern Egyptology can be traced to the arrival in Egypt of Napoleon Bonaparte in the summer of 1798.
While undeniably an invasion by an alien imperialist power, this was nonetheless an invasion of its times, informed by Enlightenment ideas: alongside Napoleon&#x27;s troops went men of science, the same whose toil under the desert sun would later yield the seminal 23-volume &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;. Two French engineers, Jean-Baptiste Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage, were assigned to study the Ramesseum site, and it was with much fanfare that they identified it with the &quot;Tomb of Ozymandias&quot; or &quot;Palace of Memnon&quot; of which Diodorus of Sicily had written in the 1st century BC.

The next visitor of note was Giovanni Belzoni, a showman and engineer of Italian origin and, latterly, an archaeologist and antiques dealer. Belzoni&#x27;s travels took him in 1815 to Cairo, where he sold Mehemet Ali a hydraulic engine of his own invention. There he met British Consul General Henry Salt, who hired his services to collect from the temple in Thebes the so-called &#x27;Younger Memnon&#x27;, one of two colossal granite heads depicting Ramesses II, and transport it to England. Thanks to Belzoni&#x27;s hydraulics and his skill as an engineer (Napoleon&#x27;s men had failed in the same endeavour a decade or so earlier), the 7-ton stone head arrived in London in 1818, where it was dubbed &quot;The Younger Memnon&quot; and, some years later, given pride of place in the British Museum.
It was against the backdrop of intense excitement surrounding the statue&#x27;s arrival, and having heard wondrous tales of other, less transportable treasures still in the desert, that the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned his sonnet &quot;Ozymandias&quot;. In particular, one massive fallen statue at the Ramesseum is now inextricably linked with Shelley, because of the cartouche on its shoulder bearing Ramesses&#x27;s throne name, &quot;User-maat-re Setep-en-re,&quot; the first part of which Diodorus transliterated into Greek as &quot;Ozymandias&quot;.
While Shelley&#x27;s &quot;vast and trunkless legs of stone&quot; owe more to poetic license than to archaeology, the &quot;half sunk... shattered visage&quot; lying on the sand is an accurate description of part of the wrecked statue. The hands, and the feet, lie nearby. Were it still standing, the Ozymandias colossus would tower 19 m (62 ft) above the ground, rivalling the Colossi of Memnon and the statues of Ramesses carved into the mountain at Abu Simbel.

A joint French-Egyptian team has been exploring and restoring the Ramesseum and its environs since 1991.
Among their discoveries during excavations include kitchens, bakeries and supply rooms for the temple to the south, and a school where boys were taught to be scribes to the southeast. Some of the challenges in preserving the area have been the control of modern Egyptian farmers using the area for farming and encroaching on the ruins.

<text>Peter John Bowles (16 October 1936 – 17 March 2022) was an English screen and stage actor. He gained prominence for television dramas such as &quot;Callan: A Magnum for Schneider&quot; and &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. He is best remembered for his roles in sitcoms and television comedy dramas, including: &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, &quot;The Bounder&quot;, &quot;The Irish R.M.&quot;, &quot;Lytton&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;Executive Stress&quot; and &quot;Perfect Scoundrels&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bowles was born in London, England. His father was Herbert Reginald Bowles, valet-companion and chauffeur to Drogo Montagu, son of the Earl of Sandwich, then a butler to the daughter of Lord Beaverbrook. His mother was Sarah Jane (née Harrison), from Scotland, who served as a nanny to the family of the Duke of Argyll before coming to England and working for Beaverbrook&#x27;s family, which is where they met. 

Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Bowles&#x27;s father was sent to Rolls-Royce Aero-engine factory in Hucknall, Nottingham, where the family lived in a small &quot;two-up, two-down&quot; house. Bowles attended the Nottingham High Pavement Grammar School, where he was taught English by the novelist Stanley Middleton, and won a scholarship to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), where he won the Kendall Prize and later he became an associate.

He later lived at 32 Kersall Drive, off the B682 in Highbury Vale, directly opposite the Henry Mellish Grammar School He attended Co-op Arts Centre.

== Theatre ==
After RADA, Bowles began his career with the Old Vic Company in 1956 playing small parts in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; and &quot;Richard II&quot; , with Claire Bloom, Paul Rogers (actor) and John Neville (actor). After a season the company toured North America, concluding with a sell-out season at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway.

In March 1956, he was given a contract by the theatre company to take part on a 25-week tour of the US and Canada, from September 1956. He first appeared at the Nottingham Playhouse on Monday 2 December 1957, in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, with Rosalie Westwater, Richard Mathews, Brian Spink, Gillian Martell, John Cater and producer John Rule.

Later in December 1957 he played the Wolf in a pantomime of Little Red Riding Hood, written by David Waller. In January 1958, the company put on Henry V, with him playing the Constable of France. In February 1958, the company put on &quot;The Perfect Woman&quot; and Three Sisters (play) by Chekhov. In March the company put on &quot;Our Town&quot;. From mid-April the company put on &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, where he played Sir Charles Marlow, and the production featured John Woodvine.

Bowles then joined the Bristol Old Vic Company for a season playing character parts and taking two Shakespeare productions to the Baalbeck Festival. This led to him being offered two plays by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, London in September 1960: Dr Copperthwaite in The Happy Haven written by John McGragh and directed by Bill Gaskell, and Kirill in Platanov by Checkov, directed by George Devine, which starred Rex Harrison. 

In 1961, after appearing in J.B. at the Phoenix Theatre directed by Laurier Lister in September (which closed after four weeks on the day of his wedding), Bowles was cast in October of that year as Roger in Bonne Soupe, starring Coral Browne and directed by Eleanor Fazan at the Comedy Theatre and then Wyndhams Theatre.

Later, Bowles was in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Absent Friends&quot;, also starring Richard Briers, at the Garrick Theatre in 1975. Then came Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land&quot; at the Arts Theatre in 1976. (Bowles had last played there in 1963 in Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Men&quot; in a cast that also included James Fox, Alan Howard and the actress and pop artist Pauline Boty). In 1980 in starred in Born in the Gardens by Peter Nichols directed by Clifford Williams first at the Bristol Old Vic and then at the Globe.

Bowles&#x27;s first starring role in the theatre after many years of TV successes was as Archie Rice in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 1986; he was the first actor to play the part in London since Laurence Olivier in 1957. In 1990 Bowles starred opposite Michael Gambon in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; at the Globe Theatre

The role of Vic Parkes was Bowles&#x27;s first, but not last, performance as an East End gangster. After &quot;Running Late&quot; Sir Peter Hall began to offer Bowles a succession of leading roles in West End theatre, including Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Separate Tables&quot; opposite Patricia Hodge. and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; with Jemma Redgrave. George S. Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Family&quot; and Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, both opposite Judi Dench at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, followed. In 1996 Bowles played Arnolphe in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The School for Wives&quot; at the Piccadilly Theatre.

Another play for Hall, this time at the Theatre Royal, Bath, was Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Browning Version&quot;. Bowles&#x27; last play for Hall was Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; in 2011, opposite Dame Penelope Keith, again at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. His other West End theatre plays include Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Sleuth&quot;, Peter Nichols&#x27; &quot;Born in the Gardens&quot;, Frederick Knott&#x27;s &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; and in 2004, Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Old Masters&quot;. directed by Harold Pinter at the Comedy Theatre. 

Then again at the Haymarket Theatre in Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;The Beau&quot;, opposite Richard McCabe, and Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Love&quot; at the Apollo Theatre. In a &quot;South Bank Show&quot; special Melvyn Bragg interviewed George MacDonald Fraser, and Bowles played the part of Fraser&#x27;s hero &#x27;Harry Flashman&#x27;. Other parts include Higgins in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and the General in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;, both at the Chichester Festival Theatre; and Judge Brack in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (translation: Frank McGuinness) opposite Francesca Annis. 

Bowles played the ultimate gangster in Mellis and Scinto&#x27;s &quot;Gangster No 1&quot; at the Almeida Theatre in 1995 for which he held the film rights; he raised money from Channel 4 Films and was executive producer for the film &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; (2000), starring Paul Bettany.

Bowles&#x27;s final starring role was Father Merrin in The Exorcist at the Phoenix Theatre directed by Sean Mathias.

==Filmography==
Bowles was warned by casting directors on leaving the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) that because of his swarthy looks he would never play an Englishman. Indeed, his early career in television consisted mostly of playing villains (usually foreign) in such shows as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (Bowles featured in four series), &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (as &#x27;A&#x27; in &quot;A. B. and C.&quot;, 1967). 

Bowles played Balor (&quot;the most evil man in the universe&quot;) in an episode of &quot;&quot;. He also appeared as Caractacus in the TV adaptation of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976). His first major English role was Guthrie Featherstone QC MP, whom he played in many series of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; (1978–1992), while in 1975 he played David Grant, husband of Abby Grant in the BBC series &quot;Survivors&quot;; his character died in the first episode. 

After playing his first comedy role on TV (Hilary) in an episode of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;, Bowles was often seen as a comedy actor and parts in comedy series such as &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, &quot;The Bounder&quot;, and &quot;Executive Stress&quot; followed; however, he turned down the role of Jerry in &quot;The Good Life&quot;. 

The success of &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, playing the part of Richard DeVere (a nouveau riche millionaire supermarket owner originally from Czechoslovakia) which had audiences of over 20 million for all twenty-one episodes, changed Bowles&#x27; life. After being told by the BBC his success in comedy meant he would never work in drama again, Bowles devised a drama series called &quot;Lytton&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which he sold to ITV. 

It was while starring in &quot;Lytton&#x27;s Diary&quot; that he was offered the title role of Major Yeates in the television series &quot;The Irish R.M.&quot; for Channel 4. A headline in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; after that series&#x27; success read &quot;Bowles Saves Channel 4&quot;. 

Much of Bowles&#x27; work was now being shown on American television, including PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, and he was very flattered to discover that admirers in America of his work included Stephen Sondheim, Quentin Tarantino and Marlon Brando. Following &quot;The Irish R.M.&quot;, Bowles co-devised the comedy/drama series &quot;Perfect Scoundrels&quot;, which ran for three series on ITV. 

In 1991, Bowles took an idea for a dramatic film to the BBC; it was accepted, and after being written and adapted by Simon Gray, became &quot;Running Late&quot;, a film in the &quot;Screen One&quot; series. This was to be Bowles&#x27; first performance on BBC Television since &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; a decade earlier. Bowles, besides starring, also co-produced with Verity Lambert. The film went on to win The Golden Gate Award in 1993 at the San Francisco International Film Festival. 

From 2016 to 2019, Bowles played the recurring role of the Duke of Wellington in the award-winning ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot;. 
==Personal life and death==
Bowles married Susan Bennett on 8 April 1961. The couple lived in Barnes, south-west London and had three children together. 

Bowles died aged 85, on 17 March 2022, from cancer.

<doc id="479825" wikidata="Q859355" url="?curid=479825" title="Big Thompson River">
<text>The Big Thompson River is a tributary of the South Platte River, approximately long, in the U.S. state of Colorado. Originating in Forest Canyon in Rocky Mountain National Park, the river flows into Lake Estes in the town of Estes Park and then through Big Thompson Canyon. It includes four crossings/bridges which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

== Course of the river ==

The headwaters of the Big Thompson River begin in Forest Canyon within Rocky Mountain National Park in Larimer County, Colorado. The river flows east through Moraine Park to the town of Estes Park. There it is held in Lake Estes by Olympus Dam before being released into the Big Thompson Canyon. The North Fork Big Thompson River also begins in Rocky Mountain National Park, on the northern slopes of the Mummy Range. This tributary flows east, through the town of Glen Haven, where it merges with the Big Thompson River in the town of Drake, in the Big Thompson Canyon.

From Lake Estes, the river descends in elevation through the mountains in the spectacular Big Thompson Canyon, emerging from the foothills west of Loveland. It flows eastward, south of Loveland across the plains into Weld County and joins the South Platte approximately south of Greeley. It receives the Little Thompson River approximately upstream from its mouth.

Water resources in the Big Thompson River are managed by the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project.

==1976 flood==
On July 31, 1976, during the celebration of Colorado&#x27;s centennial, the Big Thompson Canyon was the site of a devastating flash flood that swept down the steep and narrow canyon, claiming the lives of 143 people, 5 of whom were never found, making it the deadliest disaster in Colorado&#x27;s history. This flood was triggered by a nearly stationary thunderstorm near the upper section of the canyon that dumped of rain in less than 4 hours (more than 3/4 of the average annual rainfall for the area). Little rain fell over the lower section of the canyon, where many of the victims were.

Around 9 p.m., a wall of water more than high raced down the canyon at about , destroying 400 cars, 418 houses and 52 businesses and washing out most of U.S. Route 34. This flood was more than 4 times as strong as any in the 112-year record available in 1976, with a discharge of 1,000 cubic meters per second (35,000 ft³/s).

In 2008, a man who was thought to have died in the flood was found to be alive and living in Oklahoma. Daryle Johnson and his family had rented a cabin east of Estes Park, but left without telling anyone on the morning of July 31. A woman who was researching the flood&#x27;s victims discovered he was still alive.

==2013 flood==

The canyon was just one of the many areas along the Front Range that were devastated in the September 2013 flood. While not as intense as the 1976 flood, the storms that caused the flooding in 2013 still sent enough water down the canyon to wash out the highway in many places. The flood also damaged the US Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Dille Diversion Dam. The biggest infrastructure casualty, however, was the City of Loveland&#x27;s hydroelectric plant (rebuilt after the 1976 flood); the Idylwilde Reservoir was completely filled with silt and rocks, the Idylwilde Dam broke free of the bedrock, and the hydroelectric plant in the Viestenz-Smith Mountain Park was filled with water and silt. The dam was in the process of being relicensed with the FERC, but it was instead demolished, the dam material and contents of the reservoir being used as fill for highway repairs. The park has since been redone to accommodate the post-flood river channel and to harden it against potential future floods. The city also rebuilt its municipal electric distribution line into the canyon to replace the original 1925 transmission line and remove obsolete distribution equipment.

<text>The National Liberal and Conservative Party was the name adopted by the Conservative Party of Canada in 1920 after the end of the Unionist government of Robert Borden.

The Conservatives, led by Arthur Meighen, adopted the name in the hope of making permanent the war-time Unionist coalition of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals (known as Liberal-Unionists). Very few Liberals stayed with the party, and some Conservatives balked at the move. MP John Hampden Burnham quit the government caucus to sit as an Independent Conservative and then resigned from the House of Commons in an attempt to win a by-election on the issue.

After its defeat in the 1921 election the party caucus adopted the name Liberal-Conservative Party used under Sir John A. Macdonald though it was commonly known as the Conservative Party. The name was officially changed to the National Conservative Party at the party&#x27;s 1938 convention.

<doc id="479862" wikidata="Q1538184" url="?curid=479862" title="Liberal-Conservative Party">
<text>The Liberal-Conservative Party () was the formal name of the Conservative Party of Canada until 1873, and again from 1922 to 1938, although some Conservative candidates continued to run under the label as late as the 1911 election and others ran as simple Conservatives before 1873. In many of Canada&#x27;s early elections, there were both &quot;Liberal-Conservative&quot; and &quot;Conservative&quot; candidates; however, these were simply different labels used by candidates of the same party. Both were part of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government and official Conservative and Liberal-Conservative candidates would not, generally, run against each other. It was also common for a candidate to run on one label in one election and the other in a subsequent election.

==History==
The roots of the name are in the coalition of 1853 in which moderate Reformers and Conservatives from Canada West joined with &quot;bleus&quot; from Canada East under the dual premiership of Sir Allan MacNab and A.-N. Morin. The new ministry committed to secularizing Clergy reserves in Canada West and abolishing seigneurial tenure in Canada East. Over time, the Liberal-Conservatives evolved into the Conservative party and their opponents, the Clear Grits and the Parti rouge evolved into the Liberal Party of Canada. On October 12, 1916, the last Liberal-Conservative cabinet minister, Sam Hughes, was dismissed, making the executive all officially Conservative Party members.

Prominent Liberal-Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators in Canadian history include:
*Sir John A. Macdonald
*Sir George-Étienne Cartier
*Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt
*John Carling
*Sir John Rose
*Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee
*Joseph Howe
*Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley
*Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott
*John Henry Pope
*Joseph-Aldric Ouimet (Liberal-Conservative MP 1873–1896, ran as Conservative and defeated in 1908)
*Sir John Sparrow David Thompson
*Sir Sam Hughes
*Sir Hugh John Macdonald
*Archibald McLelan (Liberal-Conservative Senator, resigned and elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative after 1881)
*Joseph Godéric Blanchet (Liberal-Conservative from 1867 to 1875, Conservative 1875–1878, Liberal-Conservative 1878–1883)
*John Costigan (Liberal-Conservative 1867–1900, crossed the floor to join the Liberals in 1901)

The party resumed formally referring to itself as Liberal-Conservative from 1922 until 1938 when it officially became the National Conservative Party; however, it was commonly referred to as the Conservative Party throughout this period.

==Liberal Conservative Coalition==
In the 1957 election, George Rolland, a watchmaker, sought election as a Liberal Conservative Coalition candidate in the Toronto riding of Eglinton. He placed last, winning only 252 votes, or 0.7% of the total. Both the Liberal and Conservative parties nominated candidates in the riding, so Rolland did not have the endorsement of either party.

<text>In agriculture, disease management is the practice of minimizing disease in crops to increase quantity or quality of harvest yield.

Organisms that cause infectious disease in crops include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Crops can also suffer from ectoparasites including insects, mites, snails, slugs, and vertebrate animals, but these are not considered diseases.

Controlling diseases can be achieved by resistance genes, fungicides, nematicides, quarantine, etc. Disease management can be a large part of farm operating costs.

<text>New Party was the interim name used by the new political party being established in Canada from 1958 to 1961 by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), which eventually defined itself as a social democratic party. In 1958 a joint CCF-CLC committee, the National Committee for the New Party (NCNP), was formed and spent the next three years laying down the foundations of the &quot;New Party&quot;. During the process of founding the party, the New Party name was used in the October 1960 Peterborough, Canadian federal by-election; which was won by its candidate, Walter Pitman. In August 1961, at the end of a five-day-long convention, the New Democratic Party (NDP) was born and Tommy Douglas was elected its first leader. Once the NDP was formed, the New Party clubs and affiliates automatically ceased, and became part of the newly formed party.

<text>The FF-1080 is an aircraft design by Utilicraft Aerospace Industries of Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, for a twin turboprop aircraft fitted to carry LD3 aircraft cargo containers between large airports and smaller airports.

Twin Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW150C turboprop engines driving 6-bladed propellers provide the STOL performance with takeoff runs of less than . The aircraft is designed to carry as much as for a range carrying beneath its of high-mounted wings.

American Utilicraft, the predecessor of Utilicraft Aerospace Industries, patented the design for the FF-1080 in 1991. Prototype engineering began in 2000 at Aircraft Design Services Incorporated in San Antonio, Texas. A company called Micro Craft was chosen to build the prototype, with plans to build subassemblies at a factory in Huntsville, Alabama, and to assemble the prototype at Gwinnett Airport in Atlanta.

American Utilicraft entered a memorandum of understanding with the San Juan Pueblo (now known as the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo) to build a production aircraft assembly plant in northern New Mexico. The Ohkay Owingeh Indian pueblo is the owner of Ohkay Owingeh Airport. State officials encouraged the companies and the pueblo to seek state loans to begin production of the aircraft.

<text>Unity, United Progressive Movement and United Reform were the names used in Canada by a popular front party initiated by the Communist Party of Canada in the late 1930s.

==United Progressive/Unity in Saskatchewan==
Two of the movement&#x27;s members, Dorise Nielsen and Walter George Brown, were elected to the federal House of Commons in the 1940 Canadian election and two United Progressives, Alan Carl Stewart and Herman Kersler Warren, were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 1938 provincial election. The unity movement included Communists, members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (despite objections from the CCF leadership), supporters of the Canadian social credit movement, and other populists and reformers opposed to the Liberal and Conservative parties.

Dorise Nielsen was elected in North Battleford under the Unity label, and Walter George Brown was elected as a United Reform Member of Parliament in Saskatoon City.

Nielsen was a supporter of the Communist Party and ran for re-election in 1945 federal election as a Labor-Progressive Party candidate (the name adopted by the Communist Party after it was banned) and was defeated.

===United Reform in Saskatoon===
The United Reform Movement or United Reform was an attempt in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, to create a left wing farmer-labour coalition. It was part of an effort in Saskatchewan and Alberta by the Communist Party of Canada to create a united front bringing together the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, Communists, other leftists and even the populist Social Credit movement against the Liberals and Conservatives. While the movement was opposed and denounced by the leadership of the CCF it succeeded in some areas to bring local CCF activists on board.

Clergyman Walter George Brown won election to the House of Commons as a United Reform Movement candidate in a 1939 by-election in the riding of Saskatoon City, and was re-elected in the 1940 general election with the endorsement of the National Government party (as the Tories were called in 1940). He died on April 1, 1940, five days after being re-elected.

The URM recruited Agnes Macphail, a longtime Member of Parliament (MP) who had been defeated in the 1940 election to run in the by-election to fill Brown&#x27;s vacancy. MacPhail had been an MP since 1921, first as a representative for the Progressive Party of Canada and since 1930 as a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour MP, although she was active with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. In deference to her nominators, she ran as a &quot;United Reform&quot; candidate in the August 1940 by-election, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate.

There was also a &quot;United Reform&quot; candidate in the Saskatchewan riding of Weyburn who ran in the 1940 general election against Tommy Douglas of the CCF.

==United Progressive in Alberta==
In the 1940 federal election, William Halina sought election to the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Vegreville, Alberta under the United Progressive banner. Halina won 2,727 votes, or 19.4% of the total cast, placing third behind the Social Credit and Liberal candidates, but ahead of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate. Halina ran for the communist Labor-Progressive Party in the 1945 election.

<text>Cyrillization or Cyrillisation is the process of rendering words of a language that normally uses a writing system other than Cyrillic script into (a version of) the Cyrillic alphabet. Although such a process has often been carried out in an ad hoc fashion, the term &quot;cyrillization&quot; usually refers to a consistent system applied, for example, to transcribe names of German, Chinese, or English people and places for use in Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian or Bulgarian newspapers and books. Cyrillization is analogous to romanization, when words from a non-Latin script-using language are rendered in the Latin alphabet for use (e.g., in English, German, or Francophone literature.)

Just as with various Romanization schemes, each Cyrillization system has its own set of rules, depending on:
* The source language or writing system (English, French, Arabic, Hindi, Kazakh in Latin alphabet, Chinese, Japanese, etc.),
* The destination language or writing system (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Kazakh in Cyrillic, etc.),
* the goals of the systems:
** to render occasional foreign words (mostly personal and place names) for use in newspapers or on maps;
** to provide a practical approximate phonetic transcription in a phrasebook or a bilingual dictionary;
** or to convert a language to a Cyrillic writing system altogether (e.g., Dungan, Kazakh)
* Linguistic and/or political inclinations of the designers of the system (see, for example, the use—or disuse—of the letter Ґ for rendering the &quot;G&quot; of foreign words in Ukrainian).

When the source language uses a fairly phonetic spelling system (e.g., Spanish, Turkish), a Cyrillization scheme may often be adopted that almost amounts to a transliteration, i.e., using a mapping scheme that simply maps each letter of the source alphabet to some letter of the destination alphabet, sometimes augmented by position-based rules. Among such schemes are several schemes universally accepted in Eastern Slavic languages:

* Cyrillization of Arabic
* Cyrillization of Chinese
* Cyrillization of English - e.g. Cyrillisch
* Cyrillization of Esperanto
* Cyrillization of French
* Cyrillization of German
* Cyrillization of Greek
* Cyrillization of Hebrew
* Cyrillization of Hindi
* Cyrillization of Italian
* Cyrillization of Japanese - e.g. Polivanov system
* Cyrillization of Katë - used in Grjunberg&#x27;s Jazyk kati (1980)
* Cyrillization of Korean
* Cyrillization of Kurdish
* Cyrillization of Manchu
* Cyrillization of Polish
* Cyrillization of Portuguese
* Cyrillization of Spanish

Similarly, simple schemes are widely used to render words from Latin-script languages into Cyrillic-script languages.

When the source language does not use a particularly phonetic writing system—most notably English and French—its words are typically rendered in Russian, Ukrainian, or other Cyrillic-based languages using an approximate phonetic transcription system, which aims to allow the Cyrillic readers to approximate the sound of the source language as much as it is possible within the constraints of the destination language and its orthography. Among the examples are the &quot;Practical transcription of English into Russian&quot; (), which aims to render English words into Russian based on their sounds, and &quot;Transliteration of foreign words by a Cyrillic alphabet&quot; (:uk:Транслітерація іншомовних слів кирилицею) and &quot;Cyrillization of the English language&quot; (:uk:Кирилізація англійської мови) in the case of Ukrainian. While this scheme is mostly accepted by a majority of Russian and Ukrainian authors and publishers, transcription variants are not uncommon.

A transliteration system for the Bulgarian Cyrillization of English has been designed by the Bulgarian linguist Andrey Danchev.

Similarly, phonetic schemes are widely adopted for Cyrillization of French, especially considering the fairly large number of French loanwords that have been borrowed into Russian.

<text>The Bighorn Mountains ( or ) are a mountain range in northern Wyoming and southern Montana in the United States, forming a northwest-trending spur from the Rocky Mountains extending approximately northward on the Great Plains. They are separated from the Absaroka Range, which lie on the main branch of the Rockies to the west, by the Bighorn Basin. Much of the land is contained within the Bighorn National Forest.

==Geology==
The Bighorns were uplifted during the Laramide orogeny beginning approximately 70 million years ago. They consist of over of sedimentary rock strata laid down before mountain-building began: the predominantly marine and near-shore sedimentary layers range from the Cambrian through the Lower Cretaceous, and are often rich in fossils. There is an unconformity where Silurian strata were exposed to erosion and are missing. The granite bedrock below these sedimentary layers is now exposed along the crest of the Bighorns. The precambrian formations contain some of the oldest rocks in the world, at 3.25 billion years old. Following the uplift, large volumes of sediments, rich in early Tertiary fossils, were deposited in the adjoining basins. The ice ages of the Pleistocene led to extensive glaciation. Though many cirques, U-shaped valleys and glacial lakes can be found in the mountain range, the only remaining active glacier is the Cloud Peak Glacier, which is on the east slope of Cloud Peak.

Geologist N.H. Darton with the U.S. Geological Survey produced one of the earliest studies of geology in the area, drawn from field research from 1901 to 1905.

Despite extensive prospecting in the Bighorns, no major deposits of precious metals have been found to date. Brief gold rushes of placer deposits occurred at Bald Mountain City and Porcupine Creek, and in Big Goose Canyon. The lack of precious metals helped stave off development and settlement in the mountains, in contrast to the Colorado Rockies.

The Madison limestone aquifer provides a significant source of groundwater for the town of Dayton. Limestone karst formations throughout the range contain many fissures and cracks that have developed into extensive cave systems, including Tongue River Cave, and the caves adjacent to Medicine Mountain. The Natural Trap Cave on the west slope of the Bighorns contains numerous remains of prehistoric mammals.

==Geography==
The highest peaks within the Bighorns are located in Wyoming in the Bighorn National Forest. Two peaks rise to over 13,000 ft: Cloud Peak () and Black Tooth Mountain (). There are a dozen more that rise to over . From the east the mountains present a vertical relief of over , rising abruptly from the plains. Overall, the Bighorns are more rounded than their sister mountain ranges to the west.

The Cloud Peak Wilderness is the centerpiece of a roadless block of land around 189,000 acres in size. The Wilderness is surrounded by acreage of U.S National Forest as well as Bureau of Land Management, state, and some private land. Most of the Cloud Peak Wilderness is above the tree line; the National Forest lands surrounding it are lower in elevation and covered in coniferous forests. Mule deer, elk, moose, black bear, and mountain lion are found throughout the area.

Two more large roadless areas remained in the Bighorns as of 1992. It is unknown whether these areas have since been reduced in size by road-building and other development. Both areas straddle the Montana-Wyoming state line, in the northern part of the range. One area, north of U.S. Route 14A and containing the headwaters of the Little Bighorn River, is 155,000 acres of National Forest land. This little-known region features subalpine terrain cut by steep canyons. Pronghorn inhabit the area, as it includes a portion of the Great Plains. What little human use it receives is from hunters and fishermen. The second roadless area is located mainly on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana; its 144,000 acres also includes 34,000 acres of Devil&#x27;s Canyon on the Bighorn N.F. in Wyoming. In this part of the range, semidesert prairie is cut by steep canyons leading to Yellowtail Reservoir, and high, Douglas-fir cloaked ridges top out at over 9,000&#x27;. Colorful rock formations are common. Rocky Mountain juniper and limber pine are scattered on lower elevations, and wildlife includes pronghorn, rattlesnake, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, and mule deer. The Crow Indians manage a wild bison herd on this portion of the Bighorns. The Crow lands are a sacred area, and thus are off-limits to non-tribal members.

The three highways traversing the Bighorns are designated Scenic Byways by the US Forest Service and the State of Wyoming. These include U.S. Routes 14, 14A, and 16.

The high elevation of the Bighorns results in condensation of air and significant yearly snowfall, creating a highland oasis of moisture towering over the otherwise arid plains that surround the range in all directions. The melting snow feeds many rivers through the summer months. The range is the location of the headwaters of the Little Bighorn, Tongue, and Powder rivers.

Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area consists of approximately within the Bighorn Mountains. It includes Bighorn Lake, a reservoir damming the Bighorn River.

In 2015, a sudden, huge &#x27;gash&#x27; was found in Wyoming&#x27;s Big Horn Mountains. The Wyoming Geological Survey studied the area and determined that &quot;The Crack&quot; may be the result of an &quot;apparent active landslide&quot; in the southern end of the Big Horn Mountains.

==Archaeology and American Indian history==
The Bighorns provided important resources for ancestral indigenous people, including plants, migratory big game, rock shelters, tepee poles, and stone for tools. American Indian trails crisscrossed the range, while the canyons provided important winter shelters. Stone game blinds in the high country were used by pedestrian hunters to kill migratory big game animals with atlatl-propelled spears or bows. The northern Bighorns and the Tongue River drainage were formerly a significant summer range for migratory bison that wintered in either the Bighorn Basin and the Powder River/Tongue River/Little Bighorn River drainages. The southern Bighorns, particularly in the Middle Fork of the Powder River, contained an important American Indian trail adjacent to a bison migration corridor. The Wilson Price Hunt expedition of Astorians noted in 1811 that the bison dung was so dense in this area that it resembled a &quot;continuous barnyard&quot; for several miles. Hunt noticed Shoshone and Crow Indians in the area. The Medicine Wheel on the northern end of the Bighorns is an important sacred site built by ancestral tribes that is still used in present-day American Indian ceremonies.

Ancestors of the Shoshone Tribe likely had the longest continuous association with the Bighorns, potentially dating back 1,000 years or more. Stone artifacts found in the Absaroka Range farther west are known to have originated in the Bighorns, suggesting ancestral movement between the two ranges.

The Apsalooke or Crow tribe located in this region about 300–400 years ago after discovering the sacred tobacco plant growing in the Bighorn Mountains below Cloud Peak. This ended a multi-generational sojourn that began near Devils Lake, North Dakota, where a leader named No Vitals received a vision to seek the tobacco. The Crow chief Arapooish gave a speech in the 1830s showing that his people were fully aware of the migratory behaviors of bighorn sheep and deer, which spent summer on high-elevation summer range in the Bighorns and other mountain ranges.

Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota use of the Bighorns region mostly dates to the period after 1800, when they made incursions into traditional Shoshone and Crow territory. Of the Cheyenne, Arapaho and Lakota, the Arapaho had longest history on the east slope of the Rocky Mountains in a region spanning from the Yellowstone River to the Arkansas River, which included the Bighorns. The Cheyenne and Lakota were originally agricultural tribes based on rivers of the Great Plains and the Midwest. By the 1860s and 1870s, the Lakota showed a knowledge of the ancestral trail systems in the Bighorn Mountains, particularly in incidents like the Sibley Fight.

==Origins of name==

The Bighorn Mountains are named for the Bighorn River, which originated with the Crow. According to Crow oral tradition, shortly after the Crow located in this region after discovering the sacred tobacco, a stepfather pushed his son off the rim of a canyon, intending to do him harm. The boy was caught in juniper trees and survived for four days, until he was rescued by the seven sacred bighorn rams. The largest of these rams was chief of all the bighorns. This ram had horns of metal, and was called &quot;Big Metal&quot;. This ram implored the boy that the name of the river was the Bighorn River, and told the boy that if the name of the Bighorn River was ever changed, the Crow tribe would cease to exist. The name of the river became the basis for naming the Bighorn Mountains.

Many peaks of the region were named by the Crow, including Sheep Mountain &quot;Chíilapalawaache&quot; (where the bighorn ram sits), Medicine Mountain &quot;Awaxaammaaxpée&quot; (Holy Mountain), the crest divide of the Bighorns &quot;Awaxahátchke&quot; (Long Mountain), Bald Mountain &quot;Awaxaawammáakoo(2)&quot; (High Mountain). The highest peak of the range, Cloud Peak, is &quot;Awaxaawakússawishe&quot;, meaning extended mountain.

The word &quot;Bighorn Mountains&quot; were also used by the Arapaho or Cheyenne: both tribes called today&#x27;s Bighorn River &quot;Mountain Sheep River,&quot; and it was common to name mountain ranges after nearby rivers. The Cheyenne term for the Bighorn Mountains is Ma&#x27;xekȯsáeho&#x27;honáéva with the element kȯsáeho meaning bighorn sheep. The Arapaho also called the Bighorn Mountains &quot;Houuneniinoho&#x27;oooyoo&quot;&#x27; meaning &quot;Crow Tribe Mountain Range,&quot; an indication of the Crow&#x27;s use of the area in the 1800s. The Lakota word for the Bighorns is &quot;Ȟeyúškiška&quot; meaning &quot;Rugged mountain ridge&quot; or &quot;rough animal horns.&quot; The traditional Gros Ventre name is , and is a modern translation.

Overhunting of bighorn sheep, and livestock diseases and parasites introduced from domestic sheep grazing largely wiped out the native population of bighorn sheep by the early 1900s. Today the only herd of bighorn sheep in the namesake range is a reintroduced herd near Devils Canyon in the northern part of the range.

==Resource extraction==
The arrival of the Burlington and Missouri Railroad to Sheridan in 1892 created a demand for railroad ties. This led several companies to launch commercial timber harvesting in the Bighorn Mountains, such as the McShane Tie Company. Workers built several timber camps in the mountains, including Woodrock and Rockwood, and the impressive Tongue River tie flume, featuring a wooden trestle that sent ties shooting down a waterslide at more than 50 miles per hour. Small sawmills operated at locations throughout the Bighorn Range, including the Babione sawmill on Babione Creek. Commercial timber harvesting continued into the 21st century, supplying lumber mills in Buffalo and Sheridan.

Reservoir companies in the early 1900s built extensive ditch and reservoir systems in the Bighorn Mountains to support agriculture and grain farming near Sheridan, Buffalo, and Greybull. Significant reservoirs include Willow Park, Bighorn, Park, Dome, and Shell. These reservoir companies continue to operate today, with shares of water dictating the operation of ditches and priority of water appropriation, which in the 21st century primarily supports alfalfa farming and municipal water systems.

Permitted livestock grazing on the Bighorn National Forest is known to degrade water quality with microbes like &quot;e coli&quot; and giardiasis. Sheridan&#x27;s water treatment plant is built to handle this contamination.

==Recreation and human culture==
The Bighorns are a popular destination for hiking, backpacking, fly fishing, hunting, horse back riding and increasingly ATV riding and snowmobiling. Fishing opportunities abound in the Bighorns, with a high prevalence of brook trout. Camping is available at many established campgrounds with facilities, or across most of the national forest. Wilderness users must register at trailheads, but no permit is required, though there are regulations about group size, prohibiting fires at high elevation, and camping away from water sources.

Motorized trails wind through most of the national forest. The noise impacts from ATV use outside of the Cloud Peak Wilderness contrast from the former marketing motto that invited people to &quot;Visit the Bighorns if you can stand the quiet.&quot; The Cloud Peak Wilderness has a network of hiking trails to remote areas and alpine lakes. Higher trails are often covered with snow except from July through August. After Labor Day, there is a good chance of high country snow storms at any time.

The Bighorns are home to one of the elite ultramarathons in the nation. The 100-mile Bighorn Trail Run is held every June.

The Bighorns are home to two small ski areas: Meadowlark Resort off Highway 16 near Buffalo, and Antelope Butte Ski Area on U.S. 14 between Dayton and Greybull, which reopened in 2019 after a long hiatus. Antelope Butte hosts a summer festival with music, and foot and bike trail races.

The Bighorn National Forest permits land leases for hundreds of summer home cabins throughout the Bighorn Range. Regulations require the cabins to visually fit into the natural surroundings, and that cabin owners reduce fuels around the premises to reduce wildfire risk. The National Forest also permits summer grazing for cattle and sheep, and professional outfitting and hunting services.

Private inholdings and businesses within the Bighorn National Forest include Tepee Cabins, Folly Ranch, Dome Lake Club, Bighorn Reservoir Company, Kearny Reservoir, Paradise Ranch, Bear Lodge, Arrowhead Lodge, Elk View Inn, South Fork Lodge, Deer Haven Lodge, and Meadowlark Lodge, and Wyoming High Country Lodge. The former Spear O Wigwam guest ranch hosted Ernest Hemingway in 1928, where he wrote part of &quot;A Farewell to Arms.&quot;

The Sioux, Crow, and Cheyenne peoples have long considered the Bighorns sacred mountains.

<doc id="479884" wikidata="Q1758902" url="?curid=479884" title="Algorithmic composition">
<text>Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music.

Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to compose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in Western counterpoint, for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy. The term can be used to describe music-generating techniques that run without ongoing human intervention, for example through the introduction of chance procedures. However through live coding and other interactive interfaces, a fully human-centric approach to algorithmic composition is possible.

Some algorithms or data that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers as creative inspiration for their music. Algorithms such as fractals, L-systems, statistical models, and even arbitrary data (e.g. census figures, GIS coordinates, or magnetic field measurements) have been used as source materials.

==Models==
Compositional algorithms are usually classified by the specific programming techniques they use. The results of the process can then be divided into 1) music composed by computer and 2) music composed with the aid of computer. Music may be considered composed by computer when the algorithm is able to make choices of its own during the creation process.

Another way to sort compositional algorithms is to examine the results of their compositional processes. Algorithms can either 1) provide notational information (sheet music or MIDI) for other instruments or 2) provide an independent way of sound synthesis (playing the composition by itself). There are also algorithms creating both notational data and sound synthesis.

One way to categorize compositional algorithms is by their structure and the way of processing data, as seen in this model of six partly overlapping types:

* mathematical models
* knowledge-based systems
* grammars
* evolutionary methods
* systems which learn
* hybrid systems

===Translational models===
This is an approach to music synthesis that involves &quot;translating&quot; information from an existing non-musical medium into a new sound. The translation can be either rule-based or stochastic. For example, when translating a picture into sound, a JPEG image of a horizontal line may be interpreted in sound as a constant pitch, while an upwards-slanted line may be an ascending scale. Oftentimes, the software seeks to extract concepts or metaphors from the medium, (such as height or sentiment) and apply the extracted information to generate songs using the ways music theory typically represents those concepts. Another example is the translation of text into music, which can approach composition by extracting sentiment (positive or negative) from the text using machine learning methods like sentiment analysis and represents that sentiment in terms of chord quality such as minor (sad) or major (happy) chords in the musical output generated.

===Mathematical models===
Mathematical models are based on mathematical equations and random events. The most common way to create compositions through mathematics is stochastic processes. In stochastic models a piece of music is composed as a result of non-deterministic methods. The compositional process is only partially controlled by the composer by weighting the possibilities of random events. Prominent examples of stochastic algorithms are Markov chains and various uses of Gaussian distributions. Stochastic algorithms are often used together with other algorithms in various decision-making processes.

Music has also been composed through natural phenomena. These chaotic models create compositions from the harmonic and inharmonic phenomena of nature. For example, since the 1970s fractals have been studied also as models for algorithmic composition.

As an example of deterministic compositions through mathematical models, the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences provides an option to play an integer sequence as 12-tone equal temperament music. (It is initially set to convert each integer to a note on an 88-key musical keyboard by computing the integer modulo 88, at a steady rhythm. Thus 123456, the natural numbers, equals half of a chromatic scale.) As another example, the all-interval series has been used for computer-aided composition.

===Knowledge-based systems===
One way to create compositions is to isolate the aesthetic code of a certain musical genre and use this code to create new similar compositions. Knowledge-based systems are based on a pre-made set of arguments that can be used to compose new works of the same style or genre. Usually this is accomplished by a set of tests or rules requiring fulfillment for the composition to be complete.

===Grammars===
Music can also be examined as a language with a distinctive grammar set. Compositions are created by first constructing a musical grammar, which is then used to create comprehensible musical pieces. Grammars often include rules for macro-level composing, for instance harmonies and rhythm, rather than single notes.

===Optimization approaches===
When generating well defined styles, music can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem, whereby the aim is to find the right combination of notes such that the objective function is minimized. This objective function typically contains rules of a particular style, but could be learned using machine learning methods such as Markov models. Researchers have generated music using a myriad of different optimization methods, including integer programming, variable neighbourhood search, and evolutionary methods as mentioned in the next subsection.

===Evolutionary methods===
Evolutionary methods of composing music are based on genetic algorithms. The composition is being built by the means of evolutionary process. Through mutation and natural selection, different solutions evolve towards a suitable musical piece. Iterative action of the algorithm cuts out bad solutions and creates new ones from those surviving the process. The results of the process are supervised by the critic, a vital part of the algorithm controlling the quality of created compositions.

===Evo-Devo approach===
Evolutionary methods, combined with developmental processes, constitute the &quot;evo-devo&quot; approach for generation and optimization of complex structures. These methods have also been applied to music composition, where the musical structure is obtained by an iterative process that transform a very simple composition (made of a few notes) into a complex fully-fledged piece (be it a score, or a MIDI file).

===Systems that learn===

Learning systems are programs that have no given knowledge of the genre of music they are working with. Instead, they collect the learning material by themselves from the example material supplied by the user or programmer. The material is then processed into a piece of music similar to the example material. This method of algorithmic composition is strongly linked to algorithmic modeling of style, machine improvisation, and such studies as cognitive science and the study of neural networks. Assayag and Dubnov proposed a variable length Markov model to learn motif and phrase continuations of different length. Marchini and Purwins presented a system that learns the structure of an audio recording of a rhythmical percussion fragment using unsupervised clustering and variable length Markov chains and that synthesizes musical variations from it.

===Hybrid systems===
Programs based on a single algorithmic model rarely succeed in creating aesthetically satisfying results. For that reason algorithms of different type are often used together to combine the strengths and diminish the weaknesses of these algorithms. Creating hybrid systems for music composition has opened up the field of algorithmic composition and created also many brand new ways to construct compositions algorithmically. The only major problem with hybrid systems is their growing complexity and the need of resources to combine and test these algorithms.

Another approach, which can be called &quot;computer-assisted composition&quot;, is to algorithmically create certain structures for finally &quot;hand-made&quot; compositions. As early as in the 1960s, Gottfried Michael Koenig developed computer programs &quot;Project 1&quot; and &quot;Project 2&quot; for aleatoric music, the output of which was sensibly structured &quot;manually&quot; by means of performance instructions. In the 2000s, Andranik Tangian developed a computer algorithm to determine the time event structures for rhythmic canons and rhythmic fugues,
which were then worked out into harmonic compositions &quot;Eine kleine Mathmusik I&quot; and &quot;Eine kleine Mathmusik II&quot;; for scores and recordings see.

<text>Frederica of Baden (Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina; 12 March 1781 – 25 September 1826) was Queen of Sweden from 1797 to 1809 as the consort of King Gustav IV Adolf.

==Life==
===Early life===
Frederica of Baden was born at Karlsruhe Palace in the Grand Duchy of Baden on 12 March 1781 as the daughter of Karl Ludwig of Baden and Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.

Frederica, in her family known as &quot;Frick&quot; (Frique), was given a conventional and shallow education by a French-Swiss governess in Karlsruhe, and has been described as intellectually shallow. Already as a child, she was described as a beauty, but she was also reported to have a weak constitution, having had rheumatism from the age of 2.

Because her maternal aunt Natalia Alexeievna (Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt) had been the first wife of Grand Duke Paul of Russia, empress Catherine the Great considered early on to choose one of them as a bride for her eldest grandson, Grand Duke Alexander of Russia. 
In 1792, her mother visited Russia in the company of Frederica and her sister Louise of Baden. The purpose was, unofficially, for the empress to choose one of them as a bride for her grandson. Her sister was chosen to marry Alexander, and Frederica returned to Baden in the autumn of 1793.

In October 1797, Frederica of Baden married King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. The marriage had been arranged by Gustav IV Adolf himself, after he had refused to marry first Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, since his desired marriage to Ebba Modée had been refused him, and second the Russian Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, because her proposed marriage contract would have allowed Alexandra to keep her Orthodox faith. Frederica was seen as a suitable choice: Russia could not officially disapprove a new bride after the Russian Grand Duchess had been refused if the bride was the sister-in-law of Grand Duke Alexander, which indirectly preserved an alliance between Sweden and Russia, and additionally, Gustaf IV Adolf wanted a beautiful spouse and expected her to be so after having had a good impression of her sister during his visit to Russia the year prior. The king visited Erfurt to see her and her family himself in August 1797, the engagement was declared immediately after, and the first marriage ceremony conducted in October.

===Queen===
On 6 October 1797, Frederica of Baden was married &quot;per procura&quot; to king Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden in Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania, with the Swedish negotiator baron Evert Taube as proxy for the monarch. She left her mother and sister Maria, who had accompanied her to Swedish Pomerania, and was escorted by baron Taube by sea to Karlskrona in Sweden, where she was welcomed by the king. The entourage continued to Drottningholm Palace, where she was introduced to the members of the royal house and court. Finally, she made her official entrance in the capital, and the second wedding ceremony was conducted in the royal chapel on 31 October 1797. She was 16 years old.

Queen Frederica was admired for her beauty but made a bad impression because of her shyness, which caused her to isolate herself and refrain from fulfilling her ceremonial duties, and she disliked society life and representation. Her chief lady in waiting, countess Hedda Piper, reportedly contributed to her isolation by claiming that etiquette banned the queen from engaging in conversation unless introduced by her chief lady in waiting: this was in fact incorrect, but it made the queen dependent on Piper. Frederica found it difficult to adapt to court etiquette and protocol and isolated herself with her courtiers. With the exception of her chief lady in waiting, countess Piper, the king had appointed girls of about the same age as herself to be her courtiers, such as Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull, Fredrika von Kaulbars and Emilie De Geer, with whom she reportedly played children&#x27;s games.

She was treated with kindness by her mother-in-law, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, who remembered how ill she herself had been treated by her own mother-in-law.
The relationship between Frederica and Gustav IV Adolf was initially not good. Both being inexperienced, they reportedly had difficulty in connecting sexually, which frustrated the king and caused him to behave with impatient displeasure and suspicion toward her, which worsened the problems because of the shyness of the introverted Frederica. This attracted attention when the king had the queen&#x27;s favorite maid of honor, Anna Charlotta von Friesendorff, exiled from court for impertinence. The problems were eventually solved through the mediation of duchess Charlotte, and for the rest of her marriage, Frederica was almost constantly pregnant. This did not benefit the marriage from her point of view, as they were not sexually compatible: the king, who had a strong sexual drive but disliked extramarital sex, was sometimes delayed for hours after &quot;having entered the queen&#x27;s bed chamber&quot; in the morning, so much that the members of the royal council saw themselves obliged to interrupt and ask the king to &quot;spare the queen&#x27;s health&quot;, while Frederica complained in letters to her mother how it tired and exhausted her without giving fulfillment. Frederica was shocked and intrigued by the sexually liberal Swedish court, and wrote to her mother that she was likely the only woman there who did not have at least three or four lovers, and that the royal duchess Charlotte was said to have both male and female lovers.

The relationship between the king and the queen improved after the birth of their first child in 1799, after which they lived an intimate and harmonious family life in which they grew close through their mutual interest in their children. The king was reportedly protective toward her and guarded her sexual innocence. In 1800, he had all her young maids of honor relieved from their positions because of their frivolous behavior and replaced with older married ladies-in-waiting, such as Hedvig Amalia Charlotta Klinckowström and Charlotta Aurora De Geer, and six years later, when a frivolous play was performed by a French theater company at the Royal Swedish Opera in the presence of the queen, the king had the French theater company exiled and the Opera closed down.

Queen Frederica was crowned with her spouse in Norrköping 3 April 1800. The royal couple did not participate much in representation and preferred an intimate family life in the small Haga Palace, where they isolated themselves from court life with a small entourage. Frederica amused the king by her skillful clavichord playing, was reportedly joyful in the company of her small circle of friends, especially in the absence of the monarch, and devoted herself to the upbringing of her children. She kept in close correspondence with her family, and in 1801 welcomed her parents, who visited Sweden after having been in Russia to see her sister. During this visit she was reportedly reproached by her mother for her stiff and distant behavior in public and not being able to make herself popular. The visit ended in tragedy when her father died due to an accident. 
In 1802, Frederica accompanied her spouse to the province of Finland, during which a meeting was arranged between her and her sisters, the Russian empress Elizabeth and Amalie, in Abborrfors on the border. Gustav IV Adolf promised to visit her family in Baden, and in the summer of 1803, they traveled to Karlsruhe. They did not return until February 1805, which created some friction in Sweden, and Frederica was somewhat blamed for the long absence of the monarch.

She was not allowed to accompany the king when he left for Germany to participate in the War of the Fourth Coalition in November 1805, nor was she appointed to serve in the regency during his absence. During his absence, however, she came to be regarded as a symbol of moral support, and duchess Charlotte describes the dramatic scene when the queen returned to the royal palace in Stockholm after having said goodbye to the king: &quot;The members of government and the court of their majesties met her in the palace hall. Crying of bitterness she walked upstairs directly to the apartments of the children, were the members of the royal house was gathered. Close to faint, she could hardly breath and fell down upon a couch. There she lay with the handkerchief to her eyes, exposed to the deepest pain, surrounded by the children, who rushed to her, and the rest of us who, very concerned, tried to show her sympathy. She truly gave the impression of already being a widow, especially since she was dressed in black. I can not describe the touching scene! Add her youth and beauty, a beauty highlighted by the sorrow, and nothing was lacking to arouse the most fervent compassion for the poor queen.&quot; During the rest of the king&#x27;s absence, she attracted public sympathy for isolating herself completely as a display of sorrow and longing after the king.

In the winter of 1806–1807, she joined the king in Malmö, where she hosted her sister Princess Marie of Baden, who was a refugee after having fled Napoleon&#x27;s conquest of the Duchy of Brunswick.

Frederica had no direct influence on the affairs of state, and does not seem to have been interested in them except when they affected her small circle of family and friends. She was, however, indirectly involved in politics through her family and especially through her mother, who reportedly influenced her spouse against emperor Napoleon.

In 1807, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, Frederica intervened politically. Her sister, the Russian Empress, sent her a letter through their mother, writing that she should use her influence to advise the king to make peace with France, and that anything else would be a mistake. Frederica did make an attempt to accomplish this, but the king viewed it as an attempt to influence him in favor of Napoleon, and her interference in the matter caused a conflict between the two. In one political issue, Frederica took an interest during her marriage and successfully enforced her will, though her reason was not political. Even during the first years of their marriage, the king often spoke of his wish to abdicate in favor of a simple life as a private person abroad. To this, Frederica always objected and did not hesitate to press her opinion, even when it led to arguments. Her main reason for this was reportedly that if her spouse abdicated, it would result in them having to leave their son, who would succeed his father, behind.

===Coup===
On 12 March 1809, King Gustav IV Adolf left her and the children at Haga Palace to deal with the rebellion of Georg Adlersparre. The day after, he was captured at the royal palace in Stockholm in the Coup of 1809, imprisoned at Gripsholm Castle and deposed on 10 May in favor of his uncle, who succeeded him as Charles XIII of Sweden on 6 June. According to the terms deposition made on 10 May 1809, she was allowed to keep the title of queen even after the deposition of her spouse.

Frederica and her children were kept under guard at Haga Palace. The royal couple was initially kept separated because the coup leaders suspected her of planning a coup. During her house arrest, her dignified behavior reportedly earned her more sympathy than she had been given her entire tenure as queen. Her successor, Queen Charlotte, who felt sympathy for her and often visited her, belonged to the Gustavians and wished to preserve the right to the throne for Frederica&#x27;s son, Gustav. Frederica told her that she was willing to separate from her son for the sake of succession, and requested to be reunited with her spouse. Her second request was granted her after intervention from queen Charlotte, and Frederica and her children joined Gustav Adolf at Gripsholm Castle after the coronation of the new monarch on 6 June. The relationship between the former king and queen was reportedly well during their house arrest at Gripsholm.

During her house arrest at Gripsholm Castle, the question of her son crown prince Gustav&#x27;s right to the throne was not yet settled and a matter of debate.

There was a plan by a Gustavian military fraction led by General Eberhard von Vegesack to free Frederica and her children from the arrest, have her son declared monarch and Frederica as regent of Sweden during his minority. These plans were in fact presented to her, but she declined: &quot;The Queen displayed a nobility in her feelings, which makes her worthy of a crown of honor and placed her above the pitiful earthly royalty. She did not listen to the secret proposals, made to her by a party, who wished to preserve the succession of the crown prince and wished, that she would remain in Sweden to become the regent during the minority of her son... she explained with firmness, that her duty as a wife and mother told her to share the exile with her husband and children.&quot; The removal of her son from the succession order, however, she nevertheless regarded as a legally wrongful.

The family left Sweden on 6 December 1809, via three separate carriages. Gustav Adolf and Frederica traveled in one carriage, escorted by general Skjöldebrand; their son Gustav traveled in the second with colonel baron Posse; and their daughters and their governess von Panhuys traveled in the last carriage escorted by colonel von Otter. Frederica was offered to be escorted with all honors due to a member of the house of Baden if she traveled alone, but declined and brought no courtier with her, only her German chamber maid Elisabeth Freidlein. The family left for Germany by ship from Karlskrona on 6 December.

=== Exile ===
After having been denied to travel to Great Britain, the former king and queen settled in the duchy of Baden, where they arrived 10 February 1810. After having become private persons, the incompatibility between Frederica and Gustav Adolf immediately became known in their different view in how to live their life. Gustav Adolf wished to live a simple family life in a congregation of the Moravian church in Christiansfeld in Slesvig or Switzerland, while Frederica wished to settle in the palace Meersburg at Bodensee, which was granted her by her family. Their sexual differences was also brought to the surface, as Frederica refused sexual intercourse because she did not wish to give birth to exiled royalty. These differences caused Gustav Adolf to leave alone for Basel in Switzerland in April 1810, from which he expressed complaints about their sexual incompatibility and demanded a divorce.

The couple made two attempts to reconcile in person: once in Switzerland in July, and a second time in Altenburg in Thüringen in September. The attempts of reconciliation was unsuccessful and in 1811, Gustav Adolf issued divorce negotiations with her mother, stating that he wished to be able to marry again. Frederica was not willing to divorce, and her mother suggested that Gustav Adolf entered some kind of secret morganatic marriage on the side to avoid the scandal of divorce. Gustav Adolf did agree to this suggestion, but as they could not figure out how such a thing should be arranged, a proper divorce was finally issued in February 1812. In the divorce settlement, Gustav Adolf renounced all his assets in both Sweden and abroad, as well as his future assets in the form of his inheritance rights after his mother, to his children; he also renounced the custody and guardianship of his children. Two years later, Fredrica placed her children under the guardianship of her brother-in-law, the Russian Tsar Alexander. Frederica kept in contact through correspondence with queen Charlotte of Sweden, whom she entrusted her economic interests in Sweden, as well as with her former mother-in-law, and while she did not contact Gustav Adolf directly, she kept informed about his life and often contributed financially to his economy without his knowledge.

Frederica settled in the castle Bruchsal in Baden, but also acquired several other residences in Baden as well as a country villa, &quot;Villamont&quot;, outside Lausanne in Switzerland. In practice, she spent most of her time in the court of Karlsruhe from 1814 onward, and also traveled a lot around Germany, Switzerland and Italy, using the name Countess Itterburg after a ruin in Hesse, which she had acquired.

In accordance with the abdication terms, she kept her title of queen and had her own court, headed by the Swedish baron O. M. Munck af Fulkila, and kept in close contact with her many relatives and family in Germany. According to her ladies-in-waiting, she turned down proposals from her former brother-in-law Frederick William of Braunschweig-Oels, and Frederick William III of Prussia. She was rumoured to have secretly married her son&#x27;s tutor, the French-Swiss J.N.G. de Polier-Vernland, possibly in 1823.

In 1819, her daughter Sophia married the heir to the throne of Baden, Frederica&#x27;s paternal half-granduncle, the future Grand Duke Leopold I of Baden.

Her last years were plagued by weakened health. She died in Lausanne of a heart disease on 25 September 1826 and was buried in Schloss and Stiftskirche in Pforzheim, Germany.

<text>The Land Institute is an American nonprofit research, education, and policy organization dedicated to sustainable agriculture, based in Salina, Kansas. Their goal is to develop an agricultural system based on perennial crops that &quot;has the ecological stability of the prairie and a grain yield comparable to that from annual crops&quot;.

==History==
The institute was founded on in 1976 by plant geneticist and MacArthur &quot;genius grant&quot; recipient Wes Jackson along with Dana Jackson, who has worked with the Land Stewardship Project in Minnesota.

The Land Institute promotes &quot;natural systems agriculture&quot; through plant breeding. Using selective breeding and other techniques, they are working to domesticate wild perennials. The organization&#x27;s concept of developing perennial crops is modeled after the ecological design of prairies, which are known for their soil quality, deep root systems, and self-sufficiency. In an interview, Wes Jackson called the concept &quot;an inversion of industrial agriculture.&quot; Perennial polyculture systems may have a variety of benefits over conventional annual monocultures such as increased biodiversity, reduced soil erosion, and reduced inputs of irrigation, fossil fuels, fertilizers, and pesticides. Perennial crops also show promise in root-based carbon sequestration. The organization&#x27;s achievement of productive and genetically stable perennial crop plants for use by farmers is expected to take several decades. Critics note the future economic challenge in profitably harvesting perennial polyculture.

Since 1979, The Land Institute has annually hosted its Prairie Festival, which includes lectures, art displays, tours, and music performances.

==Kernza==
Kernza, an intermediate wheatgrass developed by The Land Institute, is the first commercial perennial grain crop grown across the northern United States. A perennial grain is a grain crop that lives and remains productive for three or more years. Rather than growing for only one season before harvest, like most grains and annual crops, perennial grains grow year after year. After two decades of plant breeding over 11 cycles, The Land Institute has domesticated a form of wheatgrass whose seeds are two to three times bigger than those of its wild ancestor. Under ideal conditions, it can provide as much as 30 percent of the yield of traditional wheat. They call their trademarked creation Kernza—an amalgamation of &quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;Kansas&quot;.

The University of Minnesota has one of the largest Kernza breeding programs in the country. Scientists at the University are selectively breeding the plant to improve some of the current issues, particularly those concerning yields. Their &quot;Forever Green Initiative&quot; has attracted interest from large agricultural producers like General Mills and also smaller local food shops like the Birchwood Cafe.

The General Mills brand Cascadian Farm has incorporated Kernza into some of its foods, with the first Kernza cereal produced in 2019. Cascadian Farm agreed to purchase an initial amount of the perennial grain, which is driving farmers to plant on commercial-scale fields versus the test sized plots currently being grown.

===Products===

Kernza breeding has dramatically increased seed size and production, hastening the timeline of commercialization, and resulting in the release of the first widely-available Kernza product, Long Root Ale from Patagonia Provisions, in 2016. The initiative and investment on the part of Patagonia Provisions to bring Long Root Ale to market led to other partnerships and potential Kernza products becoming more widely available to consumers. Currently, there are a number of restaurants serving products made with Kernza, including Birchwood Cafe in Minneapolis, Cafe Gratitude in the Los Angeles metro, and Avalanche Pizza in Athens, Ohio.

After the Birchwood Cafe received a 50-pound bag of grain from the University of Minnesota researchers they began baking crackers, pancakes, tortillas, and puffed grain desserts.

Hopworks Urban Brewery in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, brewed Long Root Ale for Patagonia Provisions and has it on tap, in addition to the ale in four-pack cans being sold in Whole Foods in California. Bang! Brewing in St. Paul, Minnesota, has a Kernza beer available, as does Blue Skye Brewery nearby in Salina, Kansas. Innovative Dumpling &amp; Strand produces Kernza pasta that they retail through Twin Cities-area farmers&#x27; markets. The Minneapolis based Fair State Brewing Cooperative partnered with Northern outfitter Askov Finlayson in 2018 to produce Keep the North Cold, a golden ale brewed with Kernza.

In 2024 Patagonia Provisions released a line of durum wheat and Kernza pasta.

===Ecological benefits===
With perennial soil cover such as that provided by Kernza, farmers stand to greatly reduce soil erosion, potentially turning agriculture into a soil-forming ecosystem, much like the natural ecosystems it replaced. Initial research suggests that due to extensive perennial roots, Kernza and other perennial crops may nurture beneficial soil microbiomes. The frequent soil disturbance required in annual crop production is disruptive to these microbiomes.

Deeper and more abundant root systems drive healthy soil. Scientific evidence documenting the ecosystem benefits of Kernza is accumulating. Research from other perennial systems such as pastures and perennial biofuel crops provide robust evidence of the potential benefits of a perennial grain like Kernza.

For example, Paustian and colleagues published in 2016 a paper in &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;Climate-Smart Soils&quot; that compares different landscape management approaches for increasing soil carbon sequestration. It is clear from their analysis that perennial grains would be a game-changer, as they could sequester carbon and maintain more cropland in production better than any alternative.

===Perennial Grains Story Project===

The Perennial Grains Story Project is a strategic communications collaborative whose goal is to sustain enthusiasm and support for perennial grain polyculture development, and Kernza use in particular, as part of a holistic vision for more truly sustainable food production. The partnership is enhancing internal communications among Kernza users and breeders, while working to create communications products that serve the diversity of partner goals and interest.

==Appearances in published works==
The Land Institute&#x27;s work was featured in Michael Pollan&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&quot;. The general modus operandi of developing a sustainable, high yield, low labor, agricultural model based on the culturation of crop polycultures, developed by The Land Institute forms the substance of the chapter &quot;How Will We Feed Ourselves?&quot; in Janine Benyus&#x27;s book, &quot;Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature&quot;.

<text>Wes Jackson (born 1936) co-founded the Land Institute with Dana Jackson. He is also a member of the World Future Council.

==Early life and education==
Jackson was born and raised on a farm near Topeka, Kansas. After earning a BA in biology from Kansas Wesleyan University, an MA in botany from the University of Kansas, and a PhD in genetics from North Carolina State University. Wes Jackson established and served as chair of one of the United States&#x27; first environmental studies programs at California State University, Sacramento.

Jackson then chose to leave academia, returning to his native Kansas, where he founded a non-profit organization, The Land Institute, in 1976. The Land Institute is working to develop perennial grains, pulses, and oilseed-bearing plants to be grown in ecologically intensified, diverse crop mixtures under its Natural Systems Agriculture program. In tandem with these sustainable agriculture efforts, the Ecosphere Studies program seeks to change the way people think about the world and their place in it, through educational and cultural projects with a perennial perspective. Jackson stepped down from the presidency of The Land Institute in 2016, but still works in the Ecosphere Studies program.

==Work with The Land Institute==
The Land Institute has explored alternatives in appropriate technology, environmental ethics, and education, but a research program in sustainable agriculture eventually became central to its work. In 1978, Jackson proposed the development of a perennial polyculture. He sought to have fields planted in polycultures, more than one variety of plant in a field, like diverse plants grow together in nature.

Jackson also wanted to use perennials, which would not need to be replanted every year - reducing the need for frequent tillage, preventing erosion, and promoting plant-soil microbe relationships to establish and persist. The Land Institute attempts to breed plants not presently used in agriculture into effective producers of perennial grains in intercropping conditions. Jackson argues that this version of agriculture used &quot;nature as model,&quot; and to pursue that end, &quot;The Land Institute&quot; has studied prairie ecology.

===Current and future work===
Now in its fourth decade, The Land Institute is beginning to demonstrate progress in developing the perennial crops called for in the Natural Systems Agriculture model. Programs in wheat, sorghum, and sunflower are generating crop lines displaying both perenniality and agriculturally-significant seed yield.

Research on integrating these new plants into polycultures also continues. The Land Institute is not itself developing machinery suitable for one-pass harvesting of grain polycultures. It instead takes the position that integration of existing materials separation technology into harvesters is a straightforward task, and will be accomplished by public and private agricultural engineers when the demand arrives.

==Author==
Wes Jackson is the author of several books and is recognized as a leader in the international sustainable agriculture movement. In 1971, Wes Jackson&#x27;s first efforts to address growing environmental concerns, react to social concerns growing from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, and answer student requests for more relevant materials, resulted in the environmental reader, &quot;Man and the Environment&quot;. After leaving academia and establishing the Land Institute, Jackson published &quot;New Roots for Agriculture,&quot; partially in reaction to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office on soil erosion.

This book expanded on ideas presented in a 1978 article, &quot;Towards a Sustainable Agriculture,&quot; about looking to natural ecosystems, such as the prairie, to help solve the problem of soil erosion. He collaborated with author Wendell Berry on &quot;Meeting the Expectations of the Land,&quot; in response to a Council on Agricultural Science and Technology report on agrochemicals.

Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Becoming Native to This Place,&quot; published in 1994, challenges readers to develop a relationship with their ecosystems and further develops the idea of Natural Systems Agriculture. He was a 1990 Pew Conservation Scholar and in 1992 became a MacArthur Fellow. In 2000, he received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for his single-minded commitment to developing an agriculture that is both highly productive and truly ecologically sustainable.&quot; His work is often referred to by author Wendell Berry, with whom Jackson has shared a longtime friendship and correspondence.

==Quotes==
*&quot;If we don&#x27;t get sustainability in agriculture first, sustainability will not happen.&quot;
*&quot;By beginning to make agriculture sustainable we will have taken the first step forward for humanity to begin to measure progress by its independence from the extractive economy.&quot;
*&quot;Ecosystem agriculturalists will take advantage of huge chunks of what works. They will be taking advantage of the natural integrities of ecosystems worked out over the millennia.&quot;
*&quot;If you are working on something you can finish in your lifetime, you’re not thinking big enough.&quot;

<doc id="479897" wikidata="Q6716140" url="?curid=479897" title="MINC">
<text>MINC (&quot;MINC is not C&quot;) is a data specification language written in the mid-1980s by a Princeton University graduate student named Lars Graf. This kind of naming is known as a &quot;recursive acronym&quot;. 

It contains many (though not all) of the syntactical capabilities of the C programming language, and can be used to implement simple procedural programs that can be executed by a runtime parser (that is to say, MINC does not need to be compiled in any way). 

MINC continues to be used only in a handful of programs written in the 1980s (e.g. Real-Time Cmix). It has been for all intents and purposes superseded by modern scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Tcl.

A controversial aspect of the language is whether it is pronounced &quot;mink&quot; or &quot;min-see&quot;.

<text>Pyotr Ivanovich Kafarov (, pre-reform ), also known by his monastic name Palladius (Pre-reform Russian: Палла́дій; Modern Russian: Палла́дий; 29 September 1817, Chistopol – 18 December 1878, Marseille), was an early Russian sinologist.

==Biography==
Kafarov was born in the family of an Orthodox priest. He studied in Kazan seminary and Saint-Petersbourg Academy, from which was sent to the Russian Orthodox Mission in China.

Like his teacher Hyacinth (Bichurin), Palladius was a Russian Orthodox monk. During his stay in China, he discovered and published many invaluable manuscripts, including &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;.

During his scholarly career, Kafarov&#x27;s works focused on Chinese linguistics, history, geography, and religion. Kafarov notably translated many Buddhist scriptures from Chinese, Mongolian, and Tibetan. Kafarov also studied the history of Christianity in imperial China and helped pioneer the study of Chinese Islam.

For more than three decades, Archimandrite Palladius headed the Russian Orthodox mission in China and held ethnographic and linguistic research there.

Kafarov designed a Cyrillization system for the Chinese language, known as the Palladius system. This system has remained the basis for official transcription of Chinese personal and geographical names in Russia ever since.

The &quot;Chinese-Russian Dictionary&quot; composed by Archimandrite Palladius remains a well-known work even today.

<text>Caffè corretto () is an Italian caffeinated alcoholic drink, consisting of a shot of espresso with a small amount of liquor, usually grappa, and sometimes sambuca or brandy. It is also known (outside Italy) as an &quot;espresso corretto&quot;. It is ordered as &quot;un caffè corretto alla grappa&quot;, ... &quot;alla sambuca&quot;, ... &quot;al cognac&quot;, or &quot;corretto di Spadino&quot;, depending on the desired liquor.

A &quot;caffè corretto&quot; is often prepared by simply adding a few drops of the desired spirit into an espresso shot; however in some cases the alcohol is served in a shot alongside the coffee, allowing the customer to pour the quantity they desire.

The Italian word corresponds to the English word &#x27;corrected&#x27;. The term is now an Italian phraseme.

&quot;Caffè corretto&quot; can also be found widely in Eritrea, a legacy of the Italian colonization of Eritrea. In Asmarino, locally produced &quot;areki&quot; and &quot;cognac&quot; are used.

In Spain, a similar drink is known as &quot;carajillo&quot;; in Portugal &quot;café com cheirinho&quot; (coffee with scent); in France &quot;café-calva&quot; (coffee and Calvados); in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark &quot;kaffekask&quot;, &quot;karsk&quot;, or &quot;kaffegök&quot;; and in Mexico &quot;cafe con piquete&quot;.

==Variants==

===&quot;Rexentìn&quot;===
The &quot;rexentin&quot; (or &quot;raxentin&quot;, as it is known in some places) is a tradition of the Veneto region of Italy. &quot;Rexentin&quot; means &#x27;to rinse&#x27;: after drinking the &quot;caffè corretto&quot; a small quantity of coffee remains in the cup, which is cleaned using the spirit used for the beverage, that will then be drunk.

<text>The DEC Text Processing Utility (or DECTPU) is a dedicated programming language developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to easily create multi-functional text editors.

TPU is part of OpenVMS. It can be used on a terminal, a console, or on a graphical system like DECwindows.

== Functionality ==
TPU provides text buffer management APIs in concert with window management APIs which are targeted for the VT100 line of terminals. This allowed split-screen windows with scrolling and hence multiple views of the same buffer content. There are also key mapping APIs provided, allowing a wide range of functionality for editing text. The keyboard mapping could be easily adapted by the admin or the user.

Users could write their own specific editor, to e.g. translate text or short (error) messages to multiple natural languages in a synchronised small text window. The text editor is callable, so you could have small text editors built into specific applications, e.g. a simple mail client. You might redirect output from applications into a text window, using inter-process communication. Therefore one could call web services to return their results into a text buffer.

== Implementations ==

* EVE (Extensible Versatile Editor), the first TPU-based editor, delivered with VAX/VMS by mid-1985.
* In 1986, DEC developed a new version of EDT written in TPU
* Language-Sensitive Editor, part of VAXset (software development platform)
* A version of the vi editor was created by Gregg Wonderly at Oklahoma State University called TPUVI or VITPU. VITPU is still available via the DECUS archives online.

<doc id="479912" wikidata="Q470875" url="?curid=479912" title="M. Karunanidhi">
<text>Muthuvel Karunanidhi (3 June 1924 – 7 August 2018) was an Indian writer and politician who served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for almost two decades over five terms between 1969 and 2011. He is popularly referred to as Kalaignar (Artist) and Mutthamizh Arignar (Tamil Scholar) for his contributions to Tamil literature. He had the longest intermittent tenure as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu with 6,863 days in office. He was also a long-standing leader of the Dravidian movement and ten-time president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam political party. Karunanidhi has the record of never losing an election to the Tamil Nadu Assembly, having won 13 times since his first victory in 1957. Before entering politics, he worked in the Tamil film industry as a screenwriter. He also made contributions to Tamil literature, having written stories, plays, novels, and a multiple-volume memoir. Dravida Kazhagam prominent leader Pattukottai Azhagiri conferred the title &quot;Kalaignar&quot; on him. Karunanidhi died on 7 August 2018 at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai after a series of prolonged, age-related illnesses.

Karunanidhi was born in the Tamil Nadu village of Thirukkuvalai on 3 June 1924. His parents were from the Isai Vellalar community, a caste of musicians that perform at temples and other social gatherings. Growing up in a caste-ridden culture, Karunanidhi was learned about the crippling circumstances that arose from being born into a low caste. When he was 14, he formed a student movement against the imposition of Hindi as India&#x27;s National Language during the Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40. This served as a forerunner to Karunanidhi&#x27;s wider anti-Hindi demonstrations in 1965. As a high school student, Karunanidhi created the Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, the Dravidian movement&#x27;s first student wing. He also started a news paper during his school days, which grew into the &quot;Murasoli&quot;, the DMK&#x27;s official publication. Karunanidhi began participating in theatrical productions at a young age, including composing plays. Later on, he started writing for movies. As a writer, he wrote screenplays, historical novels, screenplays, biographies, poems and novels. He utilised his writing to propagate reformist ideals effectively. He wrote the script and dialogue for M. G. Ramachandran&#x27;s maiden film as a hero, &quot;Rajakumari&quot;. He also composed the dialogue for Sivaji Ganesan&#x27;s debut film, &quot;Parasakthi&quot;. He was critical of organised religion and superstition. He was an atheist and a self-described rationalist.

Karunanidhi started his political career in 1957, when he was voted to the Madras state legislature. When the DMK first entered the state legislature the following year, he was named treasurer and deputy leader of the opposition. Karunanidhi ascended quickly through the ranks. After the death of C.N. Annadurai in 1969, he became the DMK&#x27;s leader and Chief minister of Tamil Nadu and led the party to a landslide win in the 1971 Assembly elections. He was influenced by the rationalist and egalitarian ideology of Periyar and DMK founder C N Annadurai. Karunanidhi was among those who fought Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Emergency in 1975 which led to governments getting dismissed in 1976. In the 1976 Assembly elections, he gave the Congress 50 per cent of the seats, but the partnership fell apart, and MGR prevailed. After MGR&#x27;s death in 1989, he led the party to power. His administration was dismissed in 1991 for its alleged links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He came to power in the state in 1996 after forming a partnership with the Tamil Maanila Congress and joined the United Front led by Deve Gowda in the centre. His party allied with the BJP in 1999. He was arrested from his house in 2001 by the police on the orders of Jayalalitha as an act of vendetta over alleged losses in construction of fly-overs. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, he teamed up with the Congress and won by a landslide. He became a chief minister again in 2006. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he contested alone and lost. In 2016, he made the DMK become the Tamil Nadu Assembly&#x27;s biggest opposition party.

During his political career, Karunanidhi advocated for increased state autonomy and affirmative action to favour lower castes. He implemented a caste-based quota system for government employment and government school students, as well as subsidies to the poor. His initiatives were quickly adopted in other Indian states. His initiatives earned him popularity among the lower castes. He was frequently confronted with accusations of nepotism. He has also stirred controversies by publicly supporting the LTTE and other separatist groups in Sri Lanka. During his different tenures, he implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the expansion of industry in the state. He was also instrumental in erecting a 133-foot monument of Thiruvalluvar in Kanyakumari and ensuring classical language status to Tamil language.

== Early life and family ==

Karunanidhi was born on 3 June 1924, in the village of Thirukkuvalai in Tanjore district (currently Nagapattinam district), Madras Presidency, to Ayyadurai Muthuvel and Anjugam. He had two elder sisters, Periyanayaki and Shanmugasundari. There was some misconception that his birth name was Dakshinamurthy, later changed to Karunanidhi as influenced by Dravidian and rationalist movements, Karunanidhi himself stated that C.N. Annadurai asked him to keep his birthname &quot;Karunanidhi&quot;, since it is already popular among the people. In his own writings Karunanidhi said that his family were of the Isai Vellalar, a community who had traditionally played musical instruments at ceremonial occasions; however his political rival M. G. Ramachandran and some observers contested that and said that he was of Telugu ancestry. Karunanidhi started his education at a local school. Karunanidhi&#x27;s father was eager to teach him music. His music teachers were from the Isai Vellalar group, and the lessons were conducted in temples where he was not allowed to cover his upper body, wear slippers, or wear a cotton cloth around his hips as a sign of respect for the upper caste people. He couldn&#x27;t tolerate learning in an environment where he wasn&#x27;t treated with respect, which made his father agree to stop his music classes. His father also asked the local headmaster to set up special tutoring courses for Karunanidhi and paid a tuition fee of milk every morning and evening.My music lessons were actually my first political studies. I learnt about the oppression of humans based on their caste. I saw the delight with which certain individuals could humiliate others, and the self-righteousness of others in carrying out their customs without realising that they were mistreating a large majority of the people.
At the age of 12, he left to Thiruvarur to start his high school. Karunanidhi started to organise school students for the anti-Hindi agitations. The deaths of two anti-Hindi agitators by the police made a profound impact on him. At the age of 13, he wrote his first Tamil historical novel titled &quot;Selvachandira&quot;.

== Entry into politics and early writing career ==
Karunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the Justice Party, and participated in Anti-Hindi agitations. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including Panagal Arasar, Periyar and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the anti-Hindi protests sparked by the provincial government&#x27;s legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a cycle rickshaw. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with Communism, Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of Justice Party, Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam. According to Karunanidhi, he joined the Periyar&#x27;s movement when he saw his father hurriedly rising and tied his towel to his waist from his head as a gesture of servitude when an upper caste landlord walked past him.

At the age of fifteen, Karunanidhi started his own magazine &quot;Maanavanesan&quot; (). He along with his friends would make fifty copies of the magazine and circulate it and also sometimes mailed them to the leaders of Self-respect movement. A political activist after reading his magazine asked him to lead the forum for peace, liberty equality and justice, he accepted and became its elected secretary. Later, he dissolved the forum after there was a blatant attempt to convert the forum into as a front of the Congress party. He refunded the subscription money many refused to take the refund. Using the rest of ₹75, he started the Tamil Nadu Tamil students association in 1941. In 1942, the association held an annual function attended by Bharathidasan K.A Anbazhagan and K. A. Mathiazhagan and student leaders from Annamalai University. He couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for the invitees&#x27; and guest speakers&#x27; travels and expenditures, so he was forced to steal a gold necklace that his mother had made for him but which he rarely wore, pawned it for ₹50, and paid his invitees.

As his writings were gaining popularity in Thiruvarur, he started &quot;Murasoli&quot; to widen his publishing platform. Its writer and chief editor was Karunanidhi, and its secretary was his friend Thennavan. It had a large print run, was mailed to many Tamil political organisations, and was in the forefront of the fight against caste, social isolation, sophistry, and supremacy. He wrote a critical piece in Murasoli titled &quot;Varnama, Maanama?&quot; in 1944 when a conference was organised by conservatives in support of varna system. He penned an article named &#x27;Ilamaibali&#x27; (Youth Sacrifice) and sent it to C.N Annadurai&#x27;s &quot;Dravida Nadu&quot; magazine. It appeared in the next issue. For a week, he wandered the streets of Thiruvarur with a print in hand, persuading many others to read it. He also penned an article that was never published. Within a week, Annadurai arrived in Thiruvarur for a public gathering and asked for Karunanidhi, he was stunned to find Karunanidhi as an 18-year-old school student. He instructed him to cease writing until he completed his education and asked him not to send any more articles. Karunanidhi refused to go back as a school student.

He failed three times in his final exams. During the result day, unable to face his family over his third consecutive failure, he left to Thopputhurai in search of his classmate Asan Abdul Kaathar who consoled him. He then started his passion of writing as a career. In Thiruvarur, he started writing and staging plays. These plays served as a channel for the Dravidian movement&#x27;s ideology to spread. In Thiruvarur, he presented a play named &quot;Palaniappan&quot; to raise cash for his student association. The total amount collected was only ₹80, despite the fact that the performance had cost him ₹200 to stage. He had no idea how he was going to repay the debt he owed to the individuals who were now harassing him for it. He travelled with his friend Thennavan for Nagapattinam, keen to take his chances somewhere else and met with R. V Gopal, a local leader of the Dravidar Kazhagam. Gopal sympathised with his situation but was hesitant to lend him the money but Instead bought the play for ₹100. The sale of his first play made his to write more ideological plays.

His parents didn&#x27;t approve of his writing career. They advised him to look for a job that would pay him at least ₹50 per month. He was determined on not taking a regular job. Karunanidhi then fell in love with a girl. He was certain that the girl was infatuated with him as well. When he and his family met the girl&#x27;s parents, they demanded that if a wedding was to take place, it must be performed in the presence of Brahmin priests and vedic chanting. Karunanidhi rejected, citing his belief in the Self-Respect Movement as justification.

After marriage, he worked as a playwright through the help of R.V Gopal who help his earlier with his play. Their first camp for the troupe was at Villupuram where he was joined by his friends Thennavan and C.T Murthy. Their plays failed to bring people even after the attendance of Periyar and Annadurai. The failure was due to their comments against the caste prejudices, the troupe was named &quot;Dravida Theatre group&quot;, the term &quot;Dravida&quot; was perceived to be a term for Dalits and hence non-Dalits boycotted it. The troupe started to play in Pondicherry which was at the time a hub for social cultural and political change. His plays were an instant success and people started to call him as &quot;Sivaguru&quot;, the name of his character. During his stay in Pondicherry, Karunanidhi penned &quot;&quot;That Pen!&quot; a criticism of Gandhi and the Congress centred on a pen which was lost from the Sabarmati Ashram, which infuriated the congress workers. He followed up with a piece titled &quot;What If Gandhi Became Viceroy?&quot;&quot; Later, members of the congress attacked a public gathering in Pondicherry attended by Periyar, Annadurai, and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy. Karunanidhi was chased down and beaten until he fell unconscious. They dropped his unconscious body into the sewers and departed, thinking he was dead. He was nursed back by an old women and taken to Periyar who applied medicines to him and took him to Erode along with him where he worked as an assistant editor with Periyar&#x27;s &quot;Kudi Arasu&quot; magazine in Erode for a year.

== Early political career ==
Karunanidhi along with a group of young band of Tamil enthusiasts led by Annadurai dissented from Dravidar Kazhagam and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 17 September 1949.

=== Kallakudi demonstration ===

The first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi demonstration in Kallakudi in 1953 when he was 29. The original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi. Kallakudi was renamed as &quot;Dalmiapuram&quot; by the state administration led by Rajagopalachari to commemorate the North Indian business magnate Ram Krishan Dalmia, who owned a cement factory there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi because Ram Krishna Dalmia depicted north Indian hegemonic power and predatory businesses. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Six people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested and was sent to jail for six months.

=== MLA and deputy leader of opposition ===
At the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the Kulithalai seat in Tiruchirapalli during the 1957 election among the 15 DMK legislators elected and were elected as the Chief Whip. During the 1959 elections of the Madras Municipal Corporation, he was managing the party campaigns, the party won 45 out of the 90 contested. He was elected as DMK treasurer on 25 September 1960. Karunanidhi was elected to the state assembly for the second time on 21 February 1962, from the Thanjavur constituency. He defeated Congress candidate A.Y.S. Parisutha Nadar. In the same year, he became the deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly.

During this time, Karunanidhi recognised the necessity for a regular engagement with party cadres. He began sending daily letters to his party members, whom he referred to as &quot;udan pirappukal&quot; (blood brothers), a practice he followed for fifty years.

=== 1965 Anti-Hindi Agitations and imprisonment ===

Anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu started when the Union government announced that Hindi would become the single official language. The DMK, led by CN Annadurai, planned to organise a series of rallies against the action and declared 26 January to be a day of mourning. Chants of &#x27;Hindi Ozhiga, Tamil Vaazhga&#x27; (Down with Hindi, long live Tamil) were heard everywhere. Violence continued across the state and several set themselves on fire. Karunanidhi, the leader of the DMK&#x27;s anti-Hindi agitation, was arrested on 16 February 1965, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Central Prison in Palayamkottai. He was later released at 15 April 1985.

=== Cabinet Minister of state ===

Annadurai declared Karunnanidhi as a DMK candidate for the February 1967 Madras Legislative Assembly election, at the DMK&#x27;s State-level meeting at Virugambakkam, Chennai. Karunanidhi, as DMK treasurer, raised ₹11 lakh for the party&#x27;s election campaign. For the first time, the DMK was elected with an absolute majority in February 1967 and Annadurai became the Chief minister. After being elected to the Saidapet Assembly constituency in Chennai in March 1967, Karunanidhi was appointed as the Minister of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department.

On 14 January 1969, under CN Annadurai&#x27;s administration, Madras State was rechristened as Tamil Nadu. Karunanidhi was in control of five ministries at the time: Transportation, Public Works, Highways, Ports, and Minor Irrigation.

== First term as Chief minister (1969–1971) ==

On 3 February 1969, the existing chief minister Annadurai died of cancer. On 9 February 1969, the DMK&#x27;s MLAs chose Karunanidhi to lead the party. He was also chosen as the DMK&#x27;s legislative assembly leader. Karunanidhi was appointed chief minister on 10 February 1969, the next day and was sworn in by Governor Sardar Ujjal Singh. Members of the DMK selected him as the leader of the DMK on 27 July 1969, a position that had been kept vacant during Annadurai&#x27;s tenure in honour of Periyar.

The six Ministers of Annadurai&#x27;s Cabinet were kept by Karunanidhi. In addition to his own ministries, Karunanidhi took on the ministries of late Annadurai and Nedunchezhiyan, who had refused to join his cabinet.

He once found himself in a difficult situation in the state Assembly when members of the Congress party and Rajagopalachari&#x27;s Swatantra Party hammered him and his amateur ministers with hard questions. Swatantra Party MP HV Hande described his new government as &#x27;third rate.&#x27; Karunanidhi sprang up and exclaimed, &#x27;Sorry, this is not third-rate government&#x27;, This is a fourth-rate government.&quot; The house was startled for a few minutes. Some people believed Karunanidhi had admitted to the government&#x27;s incompetence. Then Karunanidhi indicated that his government of Shudras, the lowest caste in the caste hierarchy which enraged the opposition.

Karunanidhi started sending letters to his party members in Murasoli, opening with the words &quot;Udan pirappe&quot; (My blood brothers). These letters covered a wide range of themes, including the DMK&#x27;s philosophy, his justifications for various party actions, and encouragements to party members to work very hard throughout electoral campaigns, among other things. Karunanidhi sent around 7,000 of these letters to party leaders between 1969 and his death in December 2016. They were later published in seven volumes.

Karunanidhi sponsored and presided over a State Autonomy Conference in Madras on 12 September 1970, which included Periyar, West Bengal Chief Minister Ajoy Mukherjee, numerous Parliamentarians, and other dignitaries.

During his tenure, he granted legal status to Self-Respect marriages and implemented a number of other programs aimed at protecting women and children. Karunanidhi&#x27;s administration established the Sattanathan commission for backward classes in 1969 to recognise underprivileged groups and give them with representation in government employment and educational institutions. He implemented the &quot;Manu Needhi Thittam&quot;, which mandated district officials to set aside a day every week to hear public grievances, and set up grievance redress procedures. Karunanidhi founded the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in September 1970 to build permanent houses for those living in slums. His government gave free eye surgeries for the blind from the &#x27;Kannoli Thittam&quot; In 1970, he proposed the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Reduction of Ceiling on Land) Act, which cut the maximum amount of land a family could possess up to 15 standard acres, down from 30 acres under the previous Congress rule.

== Second term as Chief Minister (1971–1976) ==

In March 1971, Karunanidhi formed an alliance with the Congress headed by Indira Gandhi, on the precondition that her party will not contest in any Assembly seats. In March 1971, the DMK contests for both the Assembly and the Lok Sabha. The DMK-Congress combination beat the Swatantra Party-Congress (Organisation) alliance led by Kamaraj and Rajagopalachari. The DMK won a landslide victory, with its candidates capturing 184 of the 234 seats on the ballot. Karunanidhi is re-elected as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the second time. He was elected from Saidapet.

Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi dismissed DMK&#x27;s Treasurer M.G. Ramachandran from the party. He made this decision in response to a request from 26 of the executive council&#x27;s 31 members. Karunanidhi later described the decision as &quot;painful&quot; at a public platform. The DMK send him a requisition accusing him of breaking party rules. MGR said he was banned because he &quot;demanded the party&#x27;s finances, especially those connected to elections&quot;. But the finances were submitted to the party executive committee. There had been conflict in the past, with MGR wanting to be Health Minister but Karunanidhi unwilling to satisfy him. On 18 October 1972, MGR founded the ADMK.

M Karunanidhi in 1970 issued an order that he said would &quot;eliminate the thorn in the heart&quot; of social reformer Periyar. The decree made it possible for people of all castes to become priests in public temples. However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision in 1972.

Until 1973, Governors raised the national flag in state capitals on both Republic Day and Independence Day. Karunanidhi protested in February of that year that the Chief Ministers were &quot;ignored&quot; on Independence Day and Republic Day. In view of the Rajamannar Committee&#x27;s report on Centre-State relations(1969–1971) being submitted at the time, he was reinforcing his call for State autonomy. In July, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave in to his demands, announcing that Chief Ministers would now hoist the flag on Independence Day, while Governors would do so on Republic Day. Karunanidhi became the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to raise the national flag at Fort St. George on 15 August 1974.

Karunanidhi launched the &quot;Beggar rehabitation scheme&quot; on his 48th birthday on 3 June 1971, and begged for funds for the scheme from shopkeepers near his residence, collecting ₹3,000 and said &quot;Begging is not an insult to the person doing the begging. But it is an insult to the country and society that made him a beggar.&quot; Karunanidhi established the Government Servants&#x27; Family Benefit Fund Scheme to give financial compensation to an employee&#x27;s relatives in the event that he loses his job owing to permanent complete disability, medical incapacity, or death. In 1971, his government increased reservation for BC from 25% to 31% and the reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) from 16% to 18%. Karunanidhi established a separate Ministry for the Welfare of the backward class, the first such in the country. During 1973, women were first inducted into the police force.

=== The Emergency and government dismissal ===

He resisted to let the Emergency&#x27;s on Tamil Nadu for approximately seven months, until his administration was ousted on 31 January 1976. Karunanidhi was a supporter of Jayaparakash Narayan&#x27;s anti-Emergency campaign and was the first one to ally with his Janata Party. During an event at Don Bosco School, Karunanidhi stated, &quot;Most likely, this would be my final public function as Chief Minister.&quot; He was dismissed before he even got home form the function. This occurred just 50 days before his tenure ended. The DMK suffered a great deal of damage once it was dismissed. 25,000 members of the party including Karunanidhi&#x27;s close relatives and friends were imprisoned. His maternal uncle Murasoli Maran and his son M.K Stalin suffered health issues from torture and C. Chittibabu died trying to save M.K Stalin in prison. He sent ₹200 a month to their families of jailed DMK members through the party office.

A one-man Sarkaria Commission was established in February 1976 under Supreme Court judge Ranjit Singh Sarkaria, shortly after the Indira Gandhi government ousted the DMK administration after allegations of corruption were made by opposition leader MGR. DMK tried to make out that the investigation was an act of political vendetta. The Sarkaria commission described the evidence on the claims as &quot;cogent, convincing, and reliable.&quot; Although none of the corruption charges against him were proved.

== Leader of the opposition (1977–1983) ==
AIADMK led alliance won 34 seats out of 39 seats in the 1977 Indian general election. Top party figures such as general secretary V.R. Nedunchezhiyan, K. Rajaram and S. Madhavan quit accusing Karunanidhi for the DMK&#x27;s failure in the general elections and demanded Karunanidhi to resign as the party&#x27;s leader. Later, DMK lost the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, Karunanidhi won from Anna Nagar consistency and became the leader of the opposition.

On 29 October 1977, DMK supporters brandished black flags and yelled &quot;Go back, Indira!&quot; as she exited the Madras Airport for dissolving the DMK government in 1975. Indira Gandhi&#x27;s vehicle was unable to pass through the black flag barrier in Madurai. Karunanidhi violated the police prohibition in Madras and led protests in Guindy. Karunanidhi and 28 other DMK leaders were detained the next day and were held in judicial custody.

MGR offered a kind hand to the Morarji Desai government, while Karunanidhi renewed his alliance with Indira Gandhi. When Indira returned to power following the untimely end of Desai&#x27;s government, she lost no time in dissolving MGR&#x27;s cabinet. In the 1980 Indian general election and 1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the state voted in favour of the AIADMK. MGR was re-elected as Chief Minister. Karunanidhi was elected from Anna Nagar consistency again. In February 1982, Karunanidhi embarked on a week-long padayatra from Madurai to Tiruchendur, spanning about 200 kilometres, in order to seek &#x27;justice&#x27; for Subramania Pillai, a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department (HR &amp; CE) officer who was found dead in November 1980. There were allegations that he was assassinated to cover financial misappropriation in the Tiruchendur temple. While Chief Minister MGR said the victim died by suicide, the DMK claimed it was an assassination. Karunanidhi walked over 30 kilometres during the day with a large crowd of cadres and leaders, stopping for lunch in small towns along the way. He gave public speeches in the evenings. The number of persons joining the padayatra grew by the day, and it became a topic of conversation in every family. The ruling government alarmed by the DMK&#x27;s support, appointed a one-man committee chaired by retired judge C.J.R. Paul. The conclusions of the panel were never presented to the Assembly. Karunanidhi was able to obtain a copy of the study and disclosed it to the public in 1982 which revealed the panel&#x27;s conclusion that Pillai had not committed suicide.

== Leader of the DMK (1983–1989) ==
Karunanidhi and DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly soon after the 1983 anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka in protest of the union government and state&#x27;s failure to defend the Eelam tamils in Sri Lanka. In May 1986, Karunanidhi established the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation (TESO) and held a major national conclave in Madurai to promote the Tamil aspiration for self-determination in Sri Lanka.

Soon after AIADMK&#x27;s election win in 1980, Congress abandoned its ally DMK and allied with AIADMK. The 1984 elections took place against the backdrop of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination. In December 1984, contested as allies in both Lok Sabha and the State Assembly which conducted together and were carried to victory by the sympathy generated for Indira Gandhi and MGR who was undergoing a Kidney transplant in New york. After being voted to the legislative council in April 1984, Karunanidhi decided to skip the elections. In 1986, the MLC was however abolished by the Chief Minister, MG Ramachandran.

Karunanidhi was instrumental in bringing the seven-party National Front together in Chennai in October 1988. With a plea for social justice, he backed Vishwanath Pratap Singh and his announcement of the Mandal Commission Report. Earlier on 17 September 1988, he organised a large rally in Chennai with largely DMK members and a public meeting to commemorate the National Front&#x27;s formation. It was the largest rally Chennai has ever seen. Its inauguration was attended by 20 top national opposition leaders, including three non-Congress(I) chief ministers.

== Third term as Chief minister (1989–1991) ==

After a 13-year break, the DMK returned to power in 1989. Following MGR&#x27;s death from a heart attack, the AIADMK split into two. The late Chief Minister MG Ramachandran&#x27;s wife Janaki Ramachandran led one faction, while J Jayalalithaa led another that helped the DMK. With about 33% of the vote, the DMK was able to secure a solid majority of 151 seats. Karunandihi was elected Chief Minister for the third time from Chennai&#x27;s Harbour constituency.

Karunanidhi allowed the LTTE to use Tamil Nadu as a rear base for its battle for Eelam Between 1989 and 1991, even after Prabhakaran took up arms against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Karunanidhi accused the Indian soldiers of rape and massacre of Tamils in Sri Lanka and refused to receive the returning soldiers. The Karunanidhi administration is then dismissed and placed under presidents rule by the Chandra Shekhar led union government after only two years of its five-year tenure due to its inability to act against Sri Lankan Tamil militants. Despite Governor S.S. Barnala&#x27;s unwillingness to report to the Union Cabinet that Tamil Nadu&#x27;s constitutional apparatus had broken down, the government has been dismissed.

He enacted legislations which provided financial assistance to widows and inter-caste weddings. In 1989, Karunanidhi passed a law giving equal rights to women in family properties. In 1989, Tamil Nadu became the first state to reserve 30% of government jobs for women. After announcing on 17 November 1990, that his government would give free power connection, he followed it up with a Government Order giving power connection to 12.40 lakh farmers. Women&#x27;s self-help groups were first established in 1989 in Dharmapuri to integrate women and increase self-employment opportunities. In 1990, Karunanidhi separated reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) which gave 1% separate quota for STs.

== Leader of the DMK (1991–1996) ==

Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE took place during the electoral campaign for the 1991 Indian general elections. The DMK was accused in the incident and mobs vandalised the properties of DMK members and functionaries. The allies AIADMK and the Congress campaigned together and spread propaganda claiming that the DMK was to responsible for Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination and it worked. The AIADMK-Congress coalition won a decisive win in the Assembly elections on 24 June 1991, and Jayalalithaa is elected Chief Minister for the first time. Except for Karunanidhi, Parithi Ilamvazhuthi is the only DMK candidates who elected in the elections, so karunanidhi resign from his seat immediately.

Following the Demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the DMK began holding rallies and public gatherings criticising the inrentions of Kar sevaks. On 5 December 1992, Karunanidhi stated in Murasoli: &quot;What does Kar Seva mean? God&#x27;s service? Or The service of planting the seeds of unrest?&quot;.

== Fourth term as Chief minister (1996–2001) ==

In 1996, he formed an alliance with the Tamil Maanila Congress, led by G.K. Moopanar, and was elected Chief Minister for the fourth time in the state. At the centre, he joined the Deve Gowda-led United Front government. Karunanidhi&#x27;s party, which had only two seats in the 1991 elections got 173 MPs, nine more than the AIADMK had the year before.

In 1999, Karunanidhi made his most significant ideological concession. The DMK joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance to fight the elections, portraying Vajpayee as a softer ideological character than LK Advani. The National Democratic Alliance won the elections. Following the DMK&#x27;s support of the BJP, the TMC, CPI(M), and CPI withdrew. The alliance with the BJP put him under increased pressure from both within and outside of the party. Following the 2002 Gujarat riots, Karunanidhi stated that both DMK and BJP were simply partners in the NDA and that the DMK had no intention of forming an alliance with the BJP. &quot;We are not affiliated with the BJP.&quot; We are members of the NDA, and so is the BJP. That&#x27;s it. So, where does the matter of forming an alliance with the BJP stand?&quot;. Later, A Raja said that Karunanidhi told him that he regretted the alliance.

He had to deal with caste animosity in numerous districts of Tamil Nadu throughout his tenure.

In 1996–97, Karunanidhi introduced the free bus pass system, which exempted government school and college students from paying for a ticket while giving private school and college students a 50% discount. Karunanidhi devised the Uzhavar Sandhai plan in 1999, which aims to promote farmer-to-consumer communication and remove the middleman and helped farmers gain more remuneration. He opened the Samathuvapuram (Equality Village) schemes in 145 places in Tamil Nadu in 1998 in order to forget and to eliminate caste-based segregation. His administration was credited for accelerating the IT revolution, introducing mini-buses for connectivity. Karunanidhi renamed Madras to Chennai to reflect Tamil identity. He introduced initiative which gives free education for the first graduate in a family up to their graduation. His decision to phase out hand-pulled rickshaws was enthusiastically applauded, and the rickshaw-pullers were given alternative work. He introduced the marriage assistance scheme for impoverished women. His government introduced legislation establishing 33% reservation for women in local government.

He was responsible for almost all of the state&#x27;s major infrastructure projects which were implemented during this tenure including the TIDEL Park, the Coimbatore flyover, the Koyambedu bus terminal, Gemini flyover in Chennai, the rehabilitation of Poompuhar, the Anna Centenary Library, and the grade separators in Chennai and the new Secretariat complex.

=== Thiruvalluvar statue ===

On 31 December 1975, during a state cabinet meeting led by Karunanidhi, a plan was authorised to erect a statue for Thiruvalluvar at Kanyakumari. The DMK administration was dismissed a month later, and the state was placed under President&#x27;s Rule. During his next term from 1989 to 1991, he resurrected the project. In March 1990, when presenting the Budget, he stated that a 133-foot-tall monument of Thiruvalluvar will be erected in Kanyakumari. He launched the project six months later. The project was restarted once he reclaimed power in May 1996. He unveiled the monument on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2000.

=== 2001 state elections ===
Jayalalithaa, who was aligned with the Tamil Maanila Congress, the Congress, the Pattali Makkal Katchi, the Communist Party of India, and other parties in 2001 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections received 49.89% of the vote, defeating the ruling DMK-led alliance by a large majority. Karunanidhi assumption that the DMK will be re-elected on the grounds of its government&#x27;s good performance proved incorrect. His government&#x27;s performance was praised by voters but it was not transferred into votes. Karunanidhi was elected from Chepauk constituency.

== Leader of the DMK (2001–2006 ) ==
He served as the president of the DMK. K. Anbazhagan was made the leader of opposition.

=== Controversy of arrests in Tamil Nadu about construction of flyovers ===

In the midnight 30 June 2001, he was arrested on the orders of J. Jayalalithaa as an act of Vendetta based on a First Information report over of alleged losses of ₹12 crore on construction of flyovers filed by Commissioner J. C. T. Acharyalu who Karunanidhi had earlier kept under suspension. He was arrested after a few hours after the complaint with no time for investigation. Sun TV broadcast these images live across the state, the cops stormed in, busted open his bedroom door, and hauled him out. The images of Karunanidhi falling, being dragged, being lifted up and pushed by the police created a sympathy wave for him. T R Baalu and Murasoli Maran, two Union ministers, were also detained. Karunanidhi told reporters &quot;They didn&#x27;t have a summons. They didn&#x27;t have an arrest warrant. They claimed that these were unnecessary. They dragged me. They pushed me. They ripped my shirt. We treated her with respect when we arrested her.&quot; Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley claimed it was a case of &#x27;personal agenda&#x27;. The Union ministers were freed and the allegations against them were dismissed. Karunanidhi was later released on bail on humanitarian grounds. The police later dropped the case in 2006 citing it was a &quot;mistake of facts&quot;.

=== 2004 general elections ===
Karunanidhi, on the other hand, left the BJP coalition in 2004 as the Union government refused to revoke the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He stood for the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress party in the general elections, which won all 39 seats of the Parliament from Tamil Nadu.

== Fifth term as Chief minister (2006–2011) ==

On 8 May 2006, Karunanidhi&#x27;s administration became the first minority administration in Tamil Nadu&#x27;s history, and soon after declared a price cut for rice and the waiver of cooperative farmer loans, two of the DMK&#x27;s main electoral promises. The DMK won 96 of the 234 seats and emerged as the single-largest party in the Assembly with the alliance of CPI-M, Congress and CPI. Karunanidhi won from Chepauk constituency.

Karunanidhi in January 2009 threatened to resign from the ruling alliance if India does not assist in securing a cease-fire in the Sri Lankan civil war.

In 2006, the DMK administration formed 30 special welfare boards entrusted with lobbying for the rights of disadvantaged and marginalised people ranging from transgenders to construction workers who may not have political influence or form voting groups and endure many forms of oppression. In 2006, Karunanidhi introduced the &#x27;Anaithu Grama Anna Marumalarchi Thittam,&#x27; which aimed for the establishment of a library in each village panchayat. In September 2006, he implemented the free land distribution scheme for the benefit of the landless poor. Karunanidhi saw the value of the ramp as a wheelchair user. He mandated that all new government buildings, as well as existing ones, include a ramp and an elevator. He reserved 3% of government jobs for the physically challenged. He launched the free gas connection distribution scheme in mid-January 2007. In September 2008, he declared that 1 kg of rice will be offered at ₹1 at PDS stores, surpassing the campaign promise of ₹2. In 2009, he introduced a special quota of 3 per cent reservations for the Arunthathiyar community. In 2019, the Arunthathiyars started building a temple &quot;as a mark of thanksgiving to Kalaignar&quot;. Karunanidhi launched the &quot;Kalaignar Kapitu Thitam&quot; in 2009 to give people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds receive quality medical treatments without discrimination. At least 3 out of 5 people in the state have medical insurance due to this scheme. In 2010, he introduced the &quot;Kalaignar Veetu Vasathi Thittam&quot; to convert thatched huts to concrete houses in the state. During this tenure he implemented the construction of new Collectorates in nine districts, many universities were established, and highways and flyovers were built. The bus terminal in Koyambedu in Chennai, which is the largest in Asia, was built. His health-care initiatives in the tenure, which included financial help for pregnant mothers, were well received by Jayalalithaa. Multiple medical camps were held around the state as part of the Varumun Kappom Thittam initiative, benefiting a huge portion of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s population. Schemes were implemented to provide free color TVs to every family with ration cards and to provide gas stoves with free gas connection to the poor women who use wood stove-kerosene stove.

== Leader of the DMK (2011–2016) ==

During the 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the AIADMK alliance won 203 seats and the DMK alliance won 31. Karunanidi won by a huge margin of 50,249 votes Tiruvarur Assembly constituency. Following the defeat, M. Karunanidhi said, &quot;People have given me proper rest,&quot; before congratulating the people of the state.

On his 86th birthday, Karunanidhi donated his Gopalapuram home to the Annai Anjugam Trust, which would manage a free hospital for the underprivileged after his and his wife&#x27;s demise.

During the 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections, which the DMK lost only by 1.5 per cent votes. Karunanidhi won from Tiruvarur constituency with margin of 68,366 votes thereby recording his 13th straight victory since 1957.

In January 2017, Karunanidhi&#x27;s son M. K. Stalin was made as the working president of the DMK at the general council meet due to his deteriorating health.

== Political positions ==

=== Sri Lankan Tamil issue ===

Karunanidhi was known among his supporters as the &quot;Tamil Inaththalaivar&quot; (leader of the Tamil race) He was close to numerous Sri Lankan Tamil politicians. In 1956, Karunanidhi issued a resolution at the DMK council in Chidambaram denouncing Sri Lanka&#x27;s &#x27;Sinhala Only policy&#x27;. He was acquainted with S.J.V. Chelvanayakam and was close with A. Amirthalingam, the head of the Tamil United Liberation Front. After 1977 anti-Tamil pogrom and 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, his administration was at the forefront of organising protest demonstrations in Tamil Nadu. In protest at the 1983 riots, Karunanidhi and DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly.

The DMK was thought to support the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO). After the LTTE started a war against its fellow Tamil militant group TELO in May 1986, Karunanidhi was sceptical of the LTTE&#x27;s strategy. Karunanidhi founded the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation (TESO) and held a large national conference in Madurai in May 1986 to emphasise the Tamil aspiration for sovereignty in Sri Lanka, during which he urged the LTTE to cease murdering TELO cadre. The LTTE then proceeded to kill the majority of the TELO cadres. The infighting was criticised by Karunanidhi as Sagodhara Yudham&#x27; (A Battle Between Brothers). Since the AIADMK and MGR were prepared to support the LTTE as the only representation of Sri Lankan Tamils, his constant attempts to convey the necessity for an unified front to the LTTE were ignored. Karunanidhi was a vocal opponent of the decision to send Indian peace keeping forces (IPKF) to Sri Lanka as part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, and he was accused of being anti-national for his outspoken criticism of the atrocities perpetrated by the IPKF. He viewed the expulsion of Muslims from the North by the LTTE in 1990 as &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot; His inaction against the LTTE in the state finally led to the Chandrasekhar government dismissing his cabinet in January 1991. After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by LTTE he was not friendly with the overt LTTE sympathizers in the state.

He ordered a special investigation of the conditions in the Tamil refugee camps in 2006, and subsequently provided funds to repair deteriorating dwellings. In 2009, during the final stages of the war, Karunanidhi was unable to convince the UPA alliance to intervene.

=== Tamil language ===
Karunanidhi on multiple occasions, expressed his admiration for Thiruvalluvar. The DMK administration built Valluvar Kottam, a memorial in Chennai dedicated to Valluvar in the mid-1970s. However, the government was removed from power in 1976, just weeks before the memorial was to be opened. Karunanidhi awaited 13 years to visit the memorial, and when the DMK regained power in January 1989, he held the swearing-in ceremony there. Karunanidhi built the Silappadikaram Art Gallery in Poompuhar and a special department for Tamil development as Chief Minister. His administration passed an order making Tamil obligatory in all schools until Class X a few weeks after he became Chief Minister in May 2006. Karunanidhi, a supporter of the two-language formula, had stressed the need of retaining English as the sole additional language in educational institutions. After consulting with scholars, his government determined in 1972 that Thiruvalluvar was born in 31 BCE. Karunanidhi and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi were vital in ensuring classical language status to Tamil in 2004.

==== World Tamil Conference ====

He delivered the special address on the inaugural day of 3rd World Tamil Conference held in Paris in 1970, and also on the inaugural day of 6th World Tamil Conference held in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in 1987. He penned the song &quot;Semmozhiyaana Tamizh Mozhiyaam&quot;, the official theme song for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010, that was set to tune by A. R. Rahman.

In June 2010, his administration organised the World Classical Tamil Conference in Coimbatore. &#x27;Ulaga Tamizh Manadu&#x27; (World Tamil Conference), was the first coined word for the conference in 2010, however the IATR organisation that had right to conduct the conference was not happy hence change in name. In the conference, Karunanidhi described Tamil as supreme among all classical languages. He reinforced the demand for Tamil to be recognised as a language of the Madras High Court. Karunanidhi announced the foundation of the World Tholkappiyar Classical Tamil Sangam, that would include worldwide academics and will be based in Madurai, to hold World Classical Tamil Conferences at periodic intervals in the future. and to bring dispersed Tamil research centres and develop connections with Tamil organisations throughout the world.

== Screenwriting ==

Karunanidhi began his career as a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry. His first movie as screenwriter was Rajakumari produced by Coimbatore-based Jupiter Pictures directed by A. S. A. Sami starring M. G. Ramachandran. During this period he and M. G. Ramachandran, then an upcoming actor and later day founder of AIADMK party started a long friendship eventually turning into rivals in later years politics. His stint with Jupiters Pictures then housed at Central Studios continued for another MGR starrer Abhimanyu, Marudhanaattu Ilavarasi (1950) starring M. G. Ramachandran and V. N. Janaki.

Around late 1949, T. R. Sundaram of Modern Theatres Studio in Salem engaged Karunanidhi as scriptwriter for the film Manthiri Kumari starring M. G. Ramachandran which would become be a blockbuster hit. Later T. R. Sundaram had Karunanidhi on permanent rolls at Modern Studio.

Karunanidhi chose to pen a script for a TV series based on the Vaishnavite philosopher-sage Ramanuja. He claimed that his party opposed Hindu fundamentalism, not Hindus.

=== &quot;Parasakthi&quot; ===
His most notable movie was &quot;Parasakthi&quot;, a turning point in Tamil cinema, as it espoused the ideologies of the Dravidian movement and also introduced two prominent actors of Tamil filmdom, Sivaji Ganesan and S. S. Rajendran. The movie was initially marred with controversies and faced censorship troubles, but was eventually released in 1952. becoming a huge box office hit. The movie was opposed by orthodox Hindus since it contained elements that criticised Hinduism. The story contained condemnation of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s severe social disparities, India&#x27;s power difference between South and the North, and the moral corruption of the Hindu priestly caste. Upper caste Hindus sought to ban the movie.

Two other movies that contained such messages were &quot;Panam&quot; (1952) directed by famous comedian and political activist N. S. Krishnan and &quot;Thangarathinam&quot; (1960) produced and acted by S. S. Rajendran another popular actor and DMK activist. These movies contained themes such as widow remarriage, abolition of untouchability, self-respect marriages, abolition of zamindari and abolition of religious hypocrisy. Another memorable hit movie was &quot;Manohara&quot; (1954) starring Sivaji Ganesan, S. S. Rajendran and P. Kannamba known for its crisp dialogues.

=== Writing and narration style ===
Through his wit and oratorical skills he rapidly rose as a popular politician. As his movies and plays with strong social messages became popular, they suffered from increased censorship; two of his plays in the 1950s were banned. He was famous for writing historical and social (reformist) stories which propagated the socialist and rationalist ideals of the Dravidian movement to which he belonged. Alongside C. N. Annadurai he began using Tamil cinema to propagate his political ideals through his movies. His compositions, which often chastised upper castes while it making heroes out of the poor and advocating secularism, were seen as revolutionary.

=== Filmography ===
At the age of 20, Karunanidhi went to work for Jupiter Pictures as a scriptwriter. His first film, &quot;Rajakumaari&quot;, gained him much popularity. It was here that his skills as a scriptwriter were honed, which extended to several films. He was active in screenwriting even during his later political career until 2011 when he last wrote for historic movie Ponnar Shankar.

Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the Tamil language through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of Valluvar Kottam he gave an architectural presence to Thiruvalluvar, in Chennai. At Kanyakumari, Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.

=== Books ===
The books written by Karunanidhi include &quot;Sanga Thamizh&quot;, &quot;Thirukkural Urai&quot;, &quot;Ponnar Sankar&quot;, &quot;Romapuri Pandian&quot;, &quot;Thenpandi Singam&quot;, &quot;Vellikizhamai&quot;, &quot;Nenjukku Needhi&quot;, &quot;Iniyavai Irubathu&quot; and &quot;Kuraloviam&quot;. His books of prose and poetry number more than 100.

=== Stage plays ===
Karunanidhi&#x27;s stage plays include: &quot;Manimagudam&quot;, &quot;Ore Ratham&quot;, &quot;Palaniappan&quot;, &quot;Thooku Medai&quot;, &quot;Kagithapoo&quot;, &quot;Naane Arivali&quot;, &quot;Vellikizhamai&quot;, &quot;Udhayasooriyan&quot; and &quot;Silappathikaram&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Karunanidhi married three times. Karunanidhi&#x27;s parents were eager to marry him off to Padma, the sister of C. S. Jayaraman. He made one condition that the bride side must accept a reformist wedding. He hoped they would call off the marriage as he was not earning and the bride&#x27;s father was religious but their family agreed to their marriage also held the marriage of their son C.S Jayaraman the same day. He married Padmavathi Ammal on 13 September 1944, under the Dravidian movement&#x27;s Self-Respect form of marriage where the bride and groom exchanged garlands, without a thaali (mangalsutra), and specifically without Brahmin priests presiding. They had a son M. K. Muthu, who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi&#x27;s marriage was arranged with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, M. K. Alagiri, M. K. Stalin and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father&#x27;s political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third marriage with Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, Kanimozhi.

Karunanidhi&#x27;s left eye got critically injured in 1953 when the vehicle in which he was travelling got involved in an accident near Tirupattur. An eye surgery was performed and doctors recommended him to wear sunglasses to protect his eyes from the sun. Karunanidhi used regular spectacles. However, after following American ophthalmologists recommendation for his ongoing discomfort in his left eye, which he had been suffering from since the mid-1950s, he switched to his trade-mark dark glasses in 1971. Doctors determined that the dark glass frames were too hefty for him in November 2017 and advised a lighter frame.

Since 2004, he has had to deal with his deteriorating health and struggled to stand when a spinal operation went wrong and became wheelchair-dependent. After a few years, he upgraded to a motorised wheelchair and a customised van with a hydraulic system to raise the chair into or out of the vehicle easily.

== Illness, death and reactions ==

Due to a drug-induced allergy, Karunanidhi became unwell in October 2016. He was hospitalised in the first week of December 2016 for &quot;optimization of nutrition and hydration&quot; and subsequently for a throat and lung infections. He went through a tracheostomy surgery to improve his breathing. He has stayed out of politics since then, making just a few public appearances. His last public appearance was on 3 June 2018, when he turned 94.

On 28 July 2018, Karunanidhi&#x27;s health deteriorated and became &quot;extremely critical and unstable&quot;, and he was admitted at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai for treatment. He died there at 18:10 on 7 August 2018 due to age-related illness, which led to multiple organ failure.

The government of Tamil Nadu declared a public holiday on 8 August 2018 and a seven-day mourning after Karunanidhi&#x27;s death. He was accorded a state funeral. A national mourning on 8 August 2018 was announced by the government of India. The national flag flew half-mast in Delhi, all state capitals and across Tamil Nadu on 8 August 2018. The governments of Karnataka and Bihar announced one-day and two-days state mourning respectively.

On 18 August 2018, the DMK said that as many as 248 party workers died, &#x27;shocked&#x27; by Karunanidhi&#x27;s demise, and announced a solatium of ₹2 lakh to their families.

== Awards and titles ==
* Annamalai University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1971.
* He was awarded &quot;Raja Rajan Award&quot; by Tamil University, Thanjavur for his book &quot;Thenpandi Singam&quot;.
* On 15 December 2006, the Governor of Tamil Nadu and the Chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University, Surjit Singh Barnala conferred an honorary doctorate on the Chief Minister on the occasion of the 40th annual convocation.
* In June 2007, the Tamil Nadu Muslim Makkal Katchi announced that it would confer the title &quot;Friend of the Muslim Community&quot; (&quot;Yaaran-E-Millath&quot;) upon M. Karunanidhi.

== Elections contested and positions held ==
Karunanidhi contested and won in all Tamil Nadu Assembly general elections (then Madras) since 1957 except 1984 when he didn&#x27;t contest the election. He resigned immediately after being elected in 1991, due to the routing of his party (only 2 seats out of 234).

== Controversies ==
=== Ram Setu remarks ===
In September 2007, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed Sethusamudram Canal project stating that it will demolish limestone shoals the party claimed to be remains of a bridge built by Rama to get to Lanka to save his wife Sita. He replied, &quot;It is said that there was a God thousands of years ago called Ram. Do not touch the bridge built by him. I ask who is this Ram? Which engineering college did he graduate from?&quot; BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Karunanidhi of religious discrimination when noting &quot;We would like to know from Karunanidhi if he would make a similar statement against the head of any other religion.&quot; CPM general secretary Prakash Karat came to his support and said &quot;in this country, there are individuals with religious views and people like us. It is not wrong to voice an opinion&quot;. Later, Karunanidhi clarified his remarks by saying that &quot;I&#x27;m not against Ram, my conscience is my God&quot;.

Suspected Sangh Parivar activists attacked the house of Karunanidhi&#x27;s daughter Selvi in Bangalore with petrol bombs and stones over his comments. A bus bound to Chennai was set on fire in Bangalore by a mob which burnt alive two people. The police blamed the attack on Hindu activists who were enraged over his comments. Karunanidhi said the attacks showed the &quot;true culture of Ram Sevaks.&quot;

=== Connections with LTTE ===
In an April 2009 interview to NDTV, Karunanidhi made a controversial remark stating that &quot;Prabhakaran is my good friend&quot; and also said, &quot;India could not forgive the LTTE for assassinating Rajiv Gandhi&quot;. An interim report of Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the investigation into Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, had indicted Karunanidhi for abetting Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s murderers, who belonged to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). but the final report contained no such allegations.

=== Allegations of nepotism ===
Karunanidhi has been accused by opponents, by some members of his party, and by other political observers of trying to promote nepotism. Many political opponents and DMK party senior leaders have been critical of the rise of M. K. Stalin in the party. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own. Stalin was jailed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during the Emergency that a fellow DMK party prisoner died trying to save him.

<text>GeoCities, later Yahoo! GeoCities, was a web hosting service that allowed users to create and publish websites for free and to browse user-created websites by their theme or interest, active from 1994 to 2009. GeoCities was started in November 1994 by David Bohnett and John Rezner, and was named Beverly Hills Internet briefly before being renamed GeoCities. On January 28, 1999, it was acquired by Yahoo!, at which time it was reportedly the third-most visited website on the World Wide Web.

In its original form, site users selected a &quot;city&quot; in which to list the hyperlinks to their Web pages. The &quot;cities&quot; were named after real cities or regions according to their content: For example, computer-related sites were placed in &quot;SiliconValley&quot; and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to &quot;Hollywood&quot;, hence the name of the site. Soon after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favor of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs.

In April 2009, the company announced that it would end the United States GeoCities service on October 26, 2009.

There were at least 38 million pages displayed by GeoCities before it was terminated, most user-written. The GeoCities Japan version of the service endured until March 31, 2019.

== History ==

GeoCities began during mid-1995 as BHI, which stood for Beverly Hills Internet, a small web hosting and development company in southern California.

The company created its own Web directory, organized thematically as six so-called &quot;neighborhoods&quot;. The neighborhoods included &quot;Colosseum&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;RodeoDrive&quot;, &quot;SunsetStrip&quot;, &quot;WallStreet&quot;, and &quot;WestHollywood&quot;. In mid-1995, the company decided to offer users (thereafter known as &quot;Homesteaders&quot;) the ability to develop free home pages within those neighborhoods, with 2 MB of space provided at the time. During the registration process, new members chose to which neighborhood they wanted to belong. This neighborhood became part of the member&#x27;s Web address along with a sequentially assigned &quot;street address&quot; number to make the URL unique (for example, &quot;www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/number&quot;). Chat, bulletin boards, and other elements of &quot;community&quot; were added soon afterward, helping foster rapid growth. On July 5, 1995, GeoCities added additional cities, including &quot;CapitolHill&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;SiliconValley&quot;, and &quot;Tokyo&quot;. By December 1995, the company, which now had a total of 14 neighborhoods, was registering thousands of Homesteaders a day and getting more than six million monthly page views. GeoCities never enforced neighborhood-specific content; for example, a &quot;Hollywood&quot; homesteader could be nothing but a college student&#x27;s home page. The company decided to emphasize increasing membership and community, and on December 15, 1995, BHI became known as GeoCities after having also been named Geopages. At that time GeoCities was headquartered at 9401 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California. By December 1996, it was headquartered on the third floor of 1918 Main Street in nearby Santa Monica, with an office on the 8th floor of the Pershing Square Building at 125 Park Avenue in New York City.
Over time, many companies, including Yahoo!, invested extensively in GeoCities and, with the introduction of paid premium services, the site continued to grow. During May 1997, GeoCities introduced advertisements on its pages. Despite negative reaction from users, GeoCities continued to grow compared to rivals. Competition in web hosting came from the likes of Tripod and Angelfire. By June 1997, GeoCities was the fifth most popular website on the Web, and by October of that year the company had registered its millionth Homesteader.

During June 1998, in an effort to increase brand awareness, GeoCities introduced a watermark to user Web pages. The watermark, much like an onscreen graphic on some television channels, was a transparent floating GIF image that used JavaScript to stay displayed on the bottom right corner of the browser screen. Many users felt the watermark interfered with the design of their Web site and threatened to relocate their Web pages elsewhere. The implementation of the watermark preceded the widespread adoption of CSS and the standardized Document Object Model and had cross-browser problems. However, GeoCities said in a press release that feedback regarding the watermark had been overwhelmingly positive.

The company became corporate during August 1998, being listed with the NASDAQ exchange with the code GCTY. The initial public offering price was $17, increasing rapidly after the initial offering to a maximum of more than $100. By 1999 GeoCities was the third-most visited site of the World Wide Web, behind AOL and Yahoo!. The headquarters had been relocated to 4499 Glencoe Avenue in Los Angeles, near the Marina del Rey area of Los Angeles County.

=== Acquisition by Yahoo! ===

During January 1999, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, GeoCities was purchased by Yahoo! for $3.57 billion in stock, with Yahoo! taking control on May 28. The acquisition proved unpopular; users began to quit &quot;en masse&quot; in protest at the new terms of service specified by Yahoo! for GeoCities. The terms stated that the company owned all rights and content, including media such as pictures. Yahoo! quickly reversed its decision. During July 1999, Yahoo! switched from neighborhood and street addresses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for homesteaders to &quot;vanity&quot; URLs through members&#x27; registration names to Yahoo! (&quot;www.geocities.com/membername&quot;). This service was offered previously only as a premium.

During 2001, amid speculation by analysts that GeoCities was not yet profitable (it having declared an $8 million loss for the final quarter of 1998), Yahoo! introduced a for-fee premium hosting service at GeoCities and reduced the accessibility of free and low-price hosting accounts by limiting their data transfer rate for Web page visitors; since that time the data transfer limit for free accounts was said to be limited to 3 GB per month, but was enforced as a limit of about 4.2 MB per hour. The paid accounts were later unified in the Yahoo! Web Hosting service, with higher data transfer limits. During 2001, a rumor began that GeoCities was to be terminated; the chain e-mail making that claim cited an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that stated the opposite.

=== Closure ===

On April 23, 2009, Yahoo! announced that it would be terminating its United States version of GeoCities, and stopped accepting new registrations, though the existing GeoCities accounts remained active. During late June 2009, Yahoo! updated the GeoCities home page to indicate: &quot;GeoCities is closing on October 26, 2009.&quot; GeoCities joined a long list of other services discontinued by Yahoo, such as Farechase, LAUNCHcast, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Photos, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, Webmessenger, and Yahoo! Teachers.

With the termination of GeoCities in the U.S., Yahoo! no longer offered free web page hosting, except in Japan, where the service continued for ten more years. Yahoo! encouraged users to upgrade their accounts to the fee-based Yahoo! Web Hosting service.

Rupert Goodwins, the editor of &quot;ZDNet&quot;, perceived the termination of GeoCities as an end of an era; he described GeoCities as &quot;the first proof that you could have something really popular and still not make any money on the internet.&quot; Vijay Mukhi, an internet and cybersecurity expert quoted in the &quot;Business Standard&quot;, criticized Yahoo&#x27;s management of GeoCities; Mukhi described GeoCities as &quot;a lost opportunity for Yahoo!&quot;, adding that &quot;they could have made it a Facebook if they wanted.&quot; Rich Skrenta, the CEO of Blekko, posted on Twitter an offer to take over GeoCities from Yahoo! in exchange for 50% future revenue share.

In response to the termination, rival Web hosting services began to compete for the sites formerly displayed by GeoCities. For instance, German Web host Jimdo started the &quot;Lifeboat for GeoCities&quot; service to encourage GeoCities users to display their sites on Jimdo. &quot;Geocities-closing.com&quot;, started by GeoCities competitor uCoz, is a similar project begun to save GeoCities websites.

Many of the webpages formerly hosted by GeoCities remained accessible, but could not be updated, until 2014. Attempts to access any page using the original GeoCities URL formerly redirected to Yahoo! Small Business, but now redirect to the Yahoo! main page.

===Archiving efforts===
Soon after the GeoCities termination announcement, the Internet Archive announced a project to archive GeoCities pages, stating &quot;GeoCities has been an important outlet for personal expression on the Web for almost 15 years.&quot; Internet Archive made it their task to ensure the thoroughness and completeness of their archive of GeoCities sites. The former Web site InternetArchaeology.org also archived and showcased artifacts from GeoCities. The operators of the site Reocities downloaded as much of the content hosted on GeoCities as they could before it ended, in an attempt to create a mirror of GeoCities, albeit an incomplete one.

Another site attempting to build an archive of defunct GeoCities sites is GeoCities.ws. There is no formal relationship between GeoCities and geocities.ws, as it is a completely different company. Many sites were duplicated automatically from GeoCities to geocities.ws many months after the termination of GeoCities. Geocities.ws also promised free hosting, and for eight years this has been the case, . Other sites with this purpose were WebCite, as well as now-defunct Geociti.es (closed 2011), Oocities.org and Ge.ocities.org.

On the first anniversary of GeoCities&#x27; termination, Archive Team announced that they would release a torrent file archive of 641 GB (prior to 7z compression, it was approximately 900 GB of data), and did so on October 29, 2010. On April 9, 2011, Archive Team released a patch for the first GeoCities torrent.

== Neighborhoods ==
In its original form, site users selected a so-called &quot;city&quot; in which to list the hyperlinks to their Web pages. The &quot;cities&quot; were named after real cities or regions according to their content: For example, computer-related sites were displayed in &quot;SiliconValley&quot; and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to &quot;Hollywood&quot;, hence the name of the site. Soon after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favor of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs. During 1996, GeoCities had 29 &quot;neighborhoods&quot;, which had groupings of content created by the &quot;homesteaders&quot; (GeoCities users). By 1999, GeoCities had additional neighborhoods and refocused existing neighborhoods.

== GeoCities Marketplace ==
During 1999, GeoCities included GeoCities Marketplace, a commercial website. It included the GeoStore, which sold GeoCities-branded merchandise. Users cashed in GeoPoints in the store.

==Reception==
The domain &quot;geocities.com&quot; attracted at least 177 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.

ComScore stated that the GeoCities had 18.9 million unique visitors from the U.S. during March 2006. During March 2008, GeoCities had 15.1 million unique U.S. visitors; however, during March 2009, GeoCities had 11.5 million unique visitors, a 24% decrease from March 2008.

In 2019, indie developer Jay Tholen released the game &quot;Hypnospace Outlaw&quot;, which was heavily influenced by GeoCities.

Neocities is a modern web hosting service with the expressed goal of reviving &quot;the support of free web hosting of the now-defunct GeoCities&quot;. In 2022, NeoCities Neighborhoods, a remake of GeoCities, was created on Neocities, featuring the same interface that the original 1996 version had.

== Litigation ==
During 1999, a complaint was instituted against GeoCities stating that the corporation violated the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, specifically , which states in relevant part, &quot;Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.&quot; The FTC found that GeoCities was engaged in deceptive acts and practices in contravention to their stated privacy act. Subsequently, a consent order was entered into, prohibiting GeoCities from misrepresenting the purpose for which it collects and/or uses personal identifying information from consumers. A copy of the complaint and order can be found at 127 F.T.C. 94 (page 94).

GeoCities provided free home pages and e-mail address to children and adults who provided personally identifying and demographic information when they registered for the website. At the time of the complaint, GeoCities had more than 1.8 million members who were &quot;homesteaders&quot;. GeoCities illegally permitted third-party advertisers to promote products targeted to GeoCities&#x27; 1.8 million users, by using personally identifiable information obtained in the registration process. These acts and practices affected &quot;commerce&quot; as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission.

The problem of GeoCities was that it placed a privacy statement on its New Member Application Form and on its website promising that it would never give personally identifying information to anyone without the user&#x27;s permission. GeoCities sold personal information to third parties who used the information for purposes other than those for which members gave permission.

It was ordered that GeoCities would not make any misrepresentation, in any manner about its collection or use of personal identifying information, including what information will be disclosed to third parties. GeoCities was not allowed to collect personal identifying information from any child if GeoCities had actual knowledge that the child did not have their parents&#x27; permission to provide the information.

<doc id="479915" wikidata="Q463038" url="?curid=479915" title="Frank Miller (Canadian politician)">
<text>Frank Stuart Miller (May 14, 1927 – July 21, 2000) was a Canadian politician who served as the 19th premier of Ontario for four months in 1985. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1971 as a Progressive Conservative member of the central Ontario riding of Muskoka. He served in the cabinet of Premier Bill Davis in several portfolios including Minister of Health and Minister of Natural Resources. He also served five years as the Treasurer of Ontario.

When Davis announced his pending resignation in 1985, Miller vied for the leadership of the party and won over a slate of three other candidates. In February, 1985, he formed a cabinet of 33 ministers which was the largest cabinet in Ontario&#x27;s history. Miller quickly called an election which was held on May 2. His party lost 18 seats but still held the most seats with 52. He formed a minority government, which lasted less than two months, when the Liberals under David Peterson and the New Democrats led by Bob Rae formed an unofficial coalition and defeated the government on a confidence motion on June 26. Initially Miller stayed on as leader of the opposition, but resigned shortly after.

Upon retirement from provincial politics, Miller moved back to Muskoka where he became chairman of the District of Muskoka. He died in 2000 in Bracebridge, Ontario.

==Background==
Miller was born in Toronto, the son of Margaret Stuart McKean and Percy Frank Miller. He attended Oakwood Collegiate Institute in Toronto, and then McGill University in Montreal where he received a degree in engineering. He had a successful career as a professional engineer, car dealer and resort operator.

==Politics==

In 1967, Miller was elected as a member of the Bracebridge town council, serving until 1970. In the 1971 Ontario provincial election, he ran for election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in Muskoka as a Progressive Conservative, and was elected. He was re-elected in the 1975, 1977, 1981, and 1985 elections.

He joined the cabinet of Premier William Davis on February 26, 1974 as Minister of Health. He planned to close a number of small hospitals and consolidate urban services after the 1975 election, but withdrew in the face of cabinet opposition. He suffered a heart attack during this period.

Miller became Minister of Natural Resources following a cabinet shuffle on February 3, 1977. On August 16, 1978, he was promoted to Treasurer and Minister of Economics. As Treasurer, he opposed the Davis government&#x27;s Suncor purchase in 1981 and considered resigning over the issue. After another shuffle on July 6, 1983, he was named Minister of Industry and Trade. In 1983, he gained notoriety for wearing a loud tartan jacket to the 1983 budget ceremony. He was caricatured by some reporters as a symbol of Ontario&#x27;s rural past, and seemed out of step with generational and demographic changes in the province. Senior party organizer Hugh Segal later acknowledged that the jacket probably alienated many new voters.

===Party leadership and Premier===

When Davis retired, Miller defeated Larry Grossman, Roy McMurtry and Dennis Timbrell for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party in its January 1985 leadership convention.

Davis and his predecessor John Robarts were considered Red Tories and ran relatively progressive administrations that increased public investment and expanded the public sector.

Under their watch, the Ontario Tories were often seen to be running left of the Liberals. Miller, on the other hand, was more typical of the party&#x27;s base of social conservatives from Ontario&#x27;s rural areas. When Davis officially stepped down on February 8, 1985, Miller became Premier. Miller&#x27;s victory created some divisions in the Progressive Conservative Party, and he had difficulty keeping order among senior party staff.

In February, 1985, Miller announced his first cabinet with a record 33 members including 7 Ministers without portfolio. The size of the cabinet belied Miller&#x27;s rhetoric of a lean, efficient government. David Peterson called it the &quot;fattest, most bloated Cabinet in the history of this province&quot;.

===1985 election===

Miller&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives had a significant lead in the polls of around 55% (compared to the two opposition parties, in the low to mid 20s) when he called an election for May 1985, but his campaign was considered disastrous. He elicited controversy when he refused to agree to a television debate with Liberal leader David Peterson and New Democratic Party leader Bob Rae. This decision is thought to have hurt Miller&#x27;s standing with the public. His situation was also made more difficult by Davis&#x27;s decision to extend public funding for Catholic Separate Schools to grade 13, a decision that had been left to Miller to implement. Although the policy was supported by all parties in the legislature, it was unpopular with some in the Tories&#x27; traditional rural Protestant base. Many PC voters were so upset that they simply stayed home on election day because of this issue.

In the election, the Liberals won a narrow plurality of the popular vote. However, at the time rural areas were still overrepresented in the Legislative Assembly, enabling Miller to win reelection. However, the Tories were cut down to a minority government, in which the Tories had only four more seats than the Liberals and were 11 seats short of a majority. The NDP, with 25 seats, held the balance of power.

===Minority government and defeat===
After several weeks of negotiations with both parties, the NDP signed an agreement with Peterson to support a Liberal minority government. As per this agreement, Rae introduced a Motion of No Confidence in the Miller government, which carried. As a result of the Liberal-NDP accord, Lieutenant-Governor John Black Aird asked Peterson to form a government. Miller formally resigned as Premier on June 26, 1985; ending 42 years of Progressive Conservative rule over Ontario.

Miller resigned as Progressive Conservative leader soon afterward. He was replaced by Larry Grossman in a November 1985 leadership convention. Miller formally resigned as party leader and Leader of the Opposition in early 1986. He played only a minor role in the legislature after this time, and did not seek re-election in 1987.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
After leaving the legislature, Miller later became chairman of the District of Muskoka.

The Tories did not return to power in Ontario until the 1995 election, when Mike Harris, who Miller had brought to his cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources, became premier.

Miller returned to private life, dying in 2000. His son, Norm Miller, entered provincial politics in 2001, winning a by-election in the riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka after Ernie Eves resigned the seat.

<doc id="479917" wikidata="Q316210" url="?curid=479917" title="Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada">
<text>Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada y Corral (; 24 April 1823 – 21 April 1889) was a Mexican liberal politician and jurist who served as the 31st president of Mexico from 1872 to 1876.

A successor to Benito Juárez, who died in office in July 1872, Lerdo de Tejada was elected to his own presidential term in November 1872. Previously, he served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Juárez&#x27;s political rival, liberal General Porfirio Díaz, had attempted a coup against Juárez, but his Plan de la Noria failed and Díaz was eliminated as a political rival during Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s 1872–1876 term, giving him considerable leeway to pursue his program without political interference. During his term, he succeeded in pacifying the country after decades of political unrest and strengthening the Mexican state. He was elected for another term in 1876, but was overthrown by Porfirio Díaz and his supporters under the Plan of Tuxtepec, which asserted the principle of no-reelection to the presidency. Lerdo de Tejada died in exile in New York in 1889, but Díaz invited the return of his body to Mexico for burial with full honors. With the exception of Miguel Miramón, a contested president during the Reform War, he was the first Mexican head of state to be born after the country&#x27;s independence.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Xalapa, Veracruz, into a middle class Criollo family, the younger brother of Miguel Lerdo de Tejada. After studying theology as a scholarship student in the Palafoxiano Seminary in Puebla he received minor orders, but decided not to enter priesthood. In 1851 he earned a law degree from Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, a famed institution he began directing at the age of 29 (1852–1863).

==Political career==

===Early positions===
In 1855, he served as a prosecutor before the Supreme Court. He became known as a Liberal leader and a supporter of President Benito Juárez. In 1857, he was minister of foreign affairs for three months under Ignacio Comonfort. He became the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1861, 1862 and 1863. He opposed the Wyke-Zamacona Convention to resume debt payments to Britain. This convention was defeated in Congress.

During the French intervention and the reign of Maximilian I, he continued to be loyal to the Republicans, and had an active share in conducting the national resistance. In the face of the French invaders, the Republican government was forced to abandon the capital of Mexico City on 31 May 1863. The Republican government continued at one place or another within the country, but never left the country during Maximilian&#x27;s reign.

On 12 September 1863 in San Luis Potosí, Lerdo de Tejada was named minister of foreign affairs, of the interior and of justice in Juárez&#x27;s cabinet. He held these posts until 17 January 1871, 14 January 1868 and 11 September 1863, respectively. Throughout the French occupation and Maximilian&#x27;s Second Empire, Lerdo de Tejada was President Juárez&#x27;s closest ally and confident. On 8 November 1865, he signed the decree extending Juárez&#x27;s term until the end of the war. In doing so, he opposed the claims of General Jesús González Ortega, who wished to succeed Juárez.

===Restored Republic under Juárez===

Upon the triumph of the Republic in 1867, Lerdo de Tejada, &quot;according to some sources ... convinced Juárez not to pardon Maximilian,&quot; who was executed in Querétaro along with two Mexicans loyal to the emperor. Once the Republicans were returned to power, Lerdo de Tejada simultaneously became minister of foreign affairs, minister of the interior, a deputy in Congress and president of the Supreme Court. Lerdo de Tejada aided Juárez&#x27;s push to centralize the power of the federal government and opposing the use of violence against local forces of opposition. Lerdo de Tejada was key for construction of what became a liberal political machine in this era. He became involved with state politics to gain political allies for the federal centralizing state.

In 1871, he was a candidate for president of the Republic, running against Juárez and Porfirio Díaz. He came in third in the race against the president who kept the republic intact during the French intervention and one of the Mexican military heroes of republican resistance. Following Juárez&#x27;s victory he returned to the Supreme Court. Díaz revolted against Juárez opposing the president&#x27;s continuation in power in the Plan de la Noria. The revolt was defeated and Díaz sent into political exile, allowing the last of Juárez&#x27;s term relatively free of political conflict. With Juárez&#x27;s death caused by a heart attack in July 1872, Lerdo de Tejada was the constitutional successor to the presidency.

===As president===
This made him interim president, but he held elections and held the office in his own right. To the surprise of most, Lerdo de Tejada kept Juárez&#x27;s cabinet basically unchanged and promulgated a limited amnesty law. To his supporters, he offered immediate spoils. He declared that he exercised his power as president, not as head of a party.

Although he sought peace, order, and respect for the law, he used the armed force of the state to achieve those goals. During his term, he achieved success in pacifying the country, particularly in eliminating regional caudillo Manuel Lozada of Tepic. Lozada had a regional fiefdom and maintained power by alliances with the French and following their expulsion, Juárez could not dislodge Lozada from power. Lerdo de Tejada was able to use federal troops to crush Lozada; Liberal General Ramón Corona defeated and executed Lozada at La Mojonera.

Lerdo de Tejada continued projects initiated by Juarez, most visibly the construction of railways. He opened the first railway line in Mexico from the port of Veracruz to the capital Mexico City, which was begun by Juárez and Lerdo de Tejada inaugurated in January 1873. However, Lerdo de Tejada had seemingly contradictory policies about railway construction. He was concerned about U.S. encroachment in northern Mexico and resisted construction of railways to the border. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Between strength and weakness, the desert,&quot; meaning the weakness of Mexico vis-à-vis the U.S. and the desert as a useful barrier. After a delay, he attempted to have a Mexican company construct the north–south line to the U.S. border, but the effort failed. Ultimately, he did approve a proposal of U.S. railway entrepreneur Edward Lee Plumb to build the line. Mexican supporters of construction thought Lerdo had delayed too long and botched the chance of Mexicans building the line, while Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s opponents viewed him as caving to the U.S.

The Laws of the Reform were incorporated into a new Constitution (25 September 1873). The Sisters of Charity were expelled from the country. In 1874, four small steamships of war were acquired for the customs service. Lerdo de Tejada also reestablished the Senate.

===The end of the Restored Republic===
Lerdo de Tejada ran for a second term in 1876, which gave opponents the grounds to oppose him on the principle of &quot;no reelection.&quot; At this point, Porfirio Díaz, who had been neutralized politically with his unsuccessful revolt against Juárez in 1872, now believed he had the grounds to challenge Lerdo de Tejada, which were articulated in the Plan of Tuxtepec. The plan was issued prior to the July 24, 1876 election, which Lerdo de Tejada won. Some charged that the victory was fraudulent, but perhaps no more so than its predecessors. Lerdo de Tejada did not muzzle the free press, which printed the accusations and began to call for open rebellion. The President of the Supreme Court, José María Iglesias did declare the election fraudulent, a ruling which put him as successor to the presidency.

Lerdo de Tejada had made himself unpopular by the means he took to secure his re-election, by his disposition to limit state rights in favor of a strongly-centralized government, and because of measures such as the expulsion of the Sisters of Charity. His forces were defeated by Díaz in the decisive Battle of Tecoac on 16 November 1876. Díaz assumed the presidency on 28 November 1876. José María Iglesias also claimed the presidency, by virtue of his position as president of the Supreme Court (31 October 1876). Díaz went on to defeat Iglesias as well.

Lerdo de Tejada went into exile in New York City, where he died in 1889. On the orders of his former rival, President Díaz, his body was returned to Mexico and buried in Mexico with full honors, in the Rotonda of Illustrious Men. At the funeral, there was barely a mention of the reasons for Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s ouster and exile. With Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s overthrow, historians have marked this as the end of the Restored Republic and the beginning of the Porfiriato, which lasted from 1876–1911 until the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.

==Legacy==

Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s principal biographer in English, Frank Averill Knapp, titled his work, &quot;The Life of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, 1823–1889: a study of influence and obscurity&quot;, an indication of Lerdo&#x27;s ambiguous legacy. He says &quot;No Mexican President has been more maligned, misunderstood, and misrepresented&quot; than Lerdo de Tejada. He did not have the implacable tenacity of Juárez nor the military achievements and political longevity of Porfirio Díaz, both of indigenous heritage from Oaxaca. But Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s presidency was a continuation of the policies of the Liberal Reform, whose laws could be implemented in times of relative peace. As such, he can be seen as one in a line of liberals aiming to modernize Mexico. A statue of Lerdo de Tejada stands outside the Mexican Congress. The city of Toluca de Lerdo was named after Lerdo de Tejada; however, the city is more commonly referred to as &quot;Toluca&quot;.

<doc id="479922" wikidata="Q5020833" url="?curid=479922" title="2004 California Proposition 57">
<text>Proposition 57 (officially, the Economic Recovery Bond Act) was a California ballot proposition on the March 2, 2004 primary election ballot. It was passed with 4,056,313 (63.4%) votes in favor and 2,348,910 (36.6%) against. The proposition authorized the state to sell $15 billion in long-term bonds to pay off accumulated deficits. Proposition 57 went into effect only because Proposition 58 (the California Balanced Budget Act) also passed.

Propositions 57 and 58 were the centerpiece of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s plan to resolve California&#x27;s budget problems. Schwarzenegger campaigned heavily for the passage of Propositions 57 and 58. California State Senator Tom McClintock, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s fellow Republican and rival in the 2003 gubernatorial recall, was one of the chief opponents of Proposition 57.

The last payment of these deficit bonds was made Wednesday, August 5, 2015. Included in the payments made over the life of the bonds were payments into a state escrow account, where interest payments totaling $4.1 billion were put aside to be paid out through July 1, 2019. When the bonds were paid off, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I’m glad this chapter of California’s fiscal history is finally closed.&quot;

== Official summary ==
* A one time Economic Recovery Bond of up to fifteen billion dollars ($15,000,000,000) to pay off the state&#x27;s accumulated General Fund deficit as of June 30, 2004.
* The Economic Recovery Bond will be issued only if the California Balanced Budget Act is also approved by the voters.
* The bonds will be secured by existing tax revenues and by other revenues that can be deposited in a special fund.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:
* One-time increase, compared to a previously authorized bond, of up to $4 billion to reduce the state&#x27;s budget shortfall.
* Annual debt-service savings over the next few years.
* Above effects offset in subsequent years by higher annual debt-service costs due to this bond&#x27;s larger size and the longer time period for its repayment.

<doc id="479936" wikidata="Q2191807" url="?curid=479936" title="Rhyme dictionary">
<text>A rime dictionary, rhyme dictionary, or rime book () is a genre of dictionary that records pronunciations for Chinese characters by tone and rhyme, instead of by graphical means like their radicals. The most important rime dictionary tradition began with the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601), which codified correct pronunciations for reading the classics and writing poetry by combining the reading traditions of north and south China. This work became very popular during the Tang dynasty, and went through a series of revisions and expansions, of which the most famous is the &quot;Guangyun&quot; (1007–1008).

These dictionaries specify the pronunciations of characters using the &quot;fanqie&quot; method, giving a pair of characters indicating the onset and remainder of the syllable respectively.
The later rime tables gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of these dictionaries by tabulating syllables by their onsets, rhyme groups, tones and other properties. The phonological system inferred from these books, often interpreted using the rime tables, is known as Middle Chinese, and has been the key datum for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese. It incorporates most of the distinctions found in modern varieties of Chinese, as well as some that are no longer distinguished. It has also been used together with other evidence in the reconstructions of Old Chinese.

Some scholars use the French spelling , as used by the Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren, for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.

==Pronunciation guides==
Chinese scholars produced dictionaries to codify reading pronunciations for the correct recitation of the classics and the associated rhyme conventions of regulated verse. The earliest rime dictionary was the &quot;Shenglei&quot; (lit. &#x27;sound types&#x27;) by Li Deng () of the Three Kingdoms period, containing more than 11,000 characters grouped under the five notes of the ancient Chinese musical scale. The book did not survive, and is known only from descriptions in later works.

Various schools of the Jin dynasty and Northern and Southern dynasties produced their own dictionaries, which differed on many points. The most prestigious standards were those of the northern capital Luoyang and the southern capital Jinling (modern Nanjing). In 601, Lù Fǎyán () published his &quot;Qieyun&quot;, an attempt to merge the distinctions in five earlier dictionaries. According to Lu Fayan&#x27;s preface, the initial plan of the work was drawn up 20 years earlier in consultation with a group of scholars, three from southern China and five from the north. However the final compilation was by Lu alone, after he had retired from government service.

The &quot;Qieyun&quot; quickly became popular as the standard of cultivated pronunciation during the Tang dynasty. The dictionaries on which it was based fell out of use, and are no longer extant. Several revisions appeared, of which the most important were:

In 1008, during the Song dynasty, a group of scholars commissioned by the emperor produced an expanded revision called the &quot;Guangyun&quot;. The &quot;Jiyun&quot; (1037) was a greatly expanded revision of the &quot;Guangyun&quot;. Lu&#x27;s initial work was primarily a guide to pronunciation, with very brief glosses, but later editions included expanded definitions, making them useful as dictionaries.

Until the mid-20th century, the oldest complete rime dictionaries known were the &quot;Guangyun&quot; and &quot;Jiyun&quot;, though extant copies of the latter were marred by numerous transcription errors. Thus all studies of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; tradition were actually based on the &quot;Guangyun&quot;. Fragments of earlier revisions of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; were found early in the century among the Dunhuang manuscripts, in Turfan and in Beijing.

When the &quot;Qieyun&quot; became the national standard in the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work. Particularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū&#x27;s edition, made in the early 9th century, by Wú Cǎiluán (), a woman famed for her calligraphy. One of these copies was acquired by Emperor Huizong (1100–1126), himself a keen calligrapher. It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor Puyi to Tianjin and then to Changchun, capital of the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in Liulichang, Beijing. Studies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and Li Rong (1956).

==Structure==
The &quot;Qieyun&quot; and its successors all had the same structure. The characters were first divided between the four tones. Because there were more characters of the &#x27;level tone&#x27; (), they occupied two ( &#x27;fascicle&#x27;, &#x27;scroll&#x27; or &#x27;volume&#x27;), while the other three tones filled one volume each. The last category or &#x27;entering tone&#x27; () consisted of words ending in stops &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-k&quot;, corresponding to words ending in nasals &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-ng&quot; in the other three tones. Today, these final stops are generally preserved in southern varieties of Chinese, but have disappeared in most northern ones, including the standard language.

Each tone was divided into rhyme groups ( ), traditionally named after the first character of the group, called the ( &#x27;rhyme eye&#x27;). Lu Fayan&#x27;s edition had 193 rhyme groups, which were expanded to 195 by Zhangsun Nayan and then to 206 by Li Zhou. The following shows the beginning of the first rhyme group of the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, with first character (&#x27;east&#x27;):

Each rhyme group was subdivided into homophone groups preceded by a small circle called a ( &#x27;button&#x27;).
The entry for each character gave a brief explanation of its meaning.
At the end of the entry for the first character of a homophone group was a description of its pronunciation, given by a  formula, a pair of characters indicating the initial ( ) and final ( ) respectively. For example, the pronunciation of was described using the characters and indicating &quot;t&quot; + &quot;uwng&quot; = .
The formula was followed by the character (in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;) or the character (in the &quot;Guangyun&quot;), followed by the number of homophonous characters. In the above sample, this formula is followed by the number , indicating that there are 17 entries, including , with the same pronunciation.

The order of the rhyme groups within each volume does not seem to follow any rule, except that similar groups were placed together, and corresponding groups in different tones were usually placed in the same order. Where two rhyme groups were similar, there was a tendency to choose exemplary words with the same initial. The table of contents of the &quot;Guangyun&quot; marks adjacent rhyme groups as (), meaning they could rhyme in regulated verse. In the above sample, under the entry for the rhyme group in the last part the table of contents (on the right page) is the notation &quot;&quot;, indicating that this group could rhyme with the following group .

The following are the rhyme groups of the &quot;Guangyun&quot; with their modern names, the finals they include (see next section), and the broad rhyme groups ( ) they were assigned to in the rime tables. A few entries are re-ordered to place corresponding rhyme groups of different tones in the same row, and darker lines separate the groups:

==Phonological system==
The rime dictionaries have been intensively studied as important sources on the phonology of medieval Chinese, and the system they reveal has been dubbed Middle Chinese. Since the &quot;Qieyun&quot; itself was believed lost until the mid-20th century, most of this work was based on the &quot;Guangyun&quot;.

The books exhaustively list the syllables and give pronunciations, but do not describe the phonology of the language.
This was first attempted in the rime tables, the oldest of which date from the Song dynasty, but which may represent a tradition going back to the late Tang dynasty.
Though not quite a phonemic analysis, these tables analysed the syllables of the rime books using lists of initials, finals and other features of the syllable.
The initials are further analysed in terms of place and manner of articulation, suggesting inspiration from Indian linguistics, at that time the most advanced in the world.
However the rime tables were compiled some centuries after the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, and many of its distinctions would have been obscure.
Edwin Pulleyblank treats the rime tables as describing a Late Middle Chinese stage, in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the rime dictionaries.

=== Structural analysis ===
In his &quot;Qièyùn kǎo&quot; (1842), the Cantonese scholar Chen Li set out to identify the initial and final categories underlying the fanqie spellings in the &quot;Guangyun&quot;.
The system was clearly not minimal, employing 452 characters as initial spellers and around 1200 as final spellers.
However no character could be used as a speller for itself.
Thus, for example,
* 東 was spelled 德 + 紅.
* 德 was spelled 多 + 特.
* 多 was spelled 德 + 河.
From this we may conclude that 東, 德 and 多 must all have had the same initial. By following such chains of equivalences Chen was able to identify categories of equivalent initial spellers, and similarly for the finals.
More common segments tended to have the most variants.
Words with the same final would rhyme, but a rhyme group might include between one and four finals with different medial glides, as seen in the above table of rhyme groups.
The inventory of initials Chen obtained resembled the 36 initials of the rime tables, but with significant differences.
In particular the &quot;light lip sounds&quot; and &quot;heavy lip sounds&quot; of the rime tables were not distinguished in the fanqie, while each of the &quot;proper tooth sounds&quot; corresponded to two distinct fanqie initial categories.

Unaware of Chen&#x27;s work, the Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren repeated the analysis identifying the initials and finals in the 1910s.
The initials could be divided into two broad types: grave initials (labials, velars and laryngeals), which combine with all finals, and acute initials (the others), with more restricted distribution.
Like Chen, Karlgren noted that in syllables with grave initials, the finals fell into two broad types, now usually referred to (following Edwin Pulleyblank) as types A and B.
He also noted that these types could be further subdivided into four classes of finals distinguished by the initials with which they could combine.
These classes partially correspond to the four rows or &quot;divisions&quot;, traditionally numbered I–IV, of the later rime tables.
The observed combinations of initials and finals are as follows:
Some of the &quot;mixed&quot; finals are actually pairs of type B finals after grave initials, with two distinct homophone groups for each initial, but a single final after acute initials. These pairs, known as &quot;chongniu&quot;, are also marked in the rime tables by splitting them between rows 3 and 4, but their interpretation remains uncertain. There is also no consensus regarding which final of the pair should be identified with the single final occurring after acute initials.

=== Reconstructed sound values ===
Karlgren also sought to determine the phonetic values of the abstract categories yielded by the formal analysis, by comparing the categories of the &quot;Guangyun&quot; with other types of evidence, each of which presented their own problems. The Song dynasty rime tables applied a sophisticated featural analysis to the rime books, but were separated from them by centuries of sound change, and some of their categories are difficult to interpret. The so-called Sino-Xenic pronunciations, readings of Chinese loanwords in Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese, were ancient, but affected by the different phonological structures of those languages. Finally modern varieties of Chinese provided a wealth of evidence, but often influenced each other as a result of a millennium of migration and political upheavals.
After applying a variant of the comparative method in a subsidiary role to flesh out the rime dictionary evidence, Karlgren believed that he had reconstructed the speech of the Sui-Tang capital Chang&#x27;an.

Later workers have refined Karlgren&#x27;s reconstruction.
The initials of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; system are given below with their traditional names and approximate values:
In most cases, the simpler inventories of initials of modern varieties of Chinese can be treated as varying developments of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; initials. The voicing distinction is retained in Wu Chinese dialects, but has disappeared from other varieties. Except in the Min Chinese dialects, a labiodental series has split from the labial series, a development already reflected in the Song dynasty rime tables. The retroflex and palatal sibilants had also merged by that time. In Min dialects the retroflex stops have merged with the dental stops, while elsewhere they have merged with the retroflex sibilants. In the south these have also merged with the dental sibilants, but the distinction is maintained in most Mandarin Chinese dialects. The palatal series of modern Mandarin dialects, resulting from a merger of palatal allophones of dental sibilants and velars, is a much more recent development.

Assigning phonetic values to the finals has proved more difficult, as many of the distinctions reflected in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; have been lost over time.
Karlgren proposed that type B finals contained a palatal medial , a position that is still accepted by most scholars. However Pulleyblank, noting the use of these syllables in the transcription of foreign words without such a medial, claims the medial developed later.
A labiovelar medial is also widely accepted, with some syllables having both medials.
The codas are believed to reflect those of many modern varieties, namely the glides and , nasals , and and corresponding stops , and .
Some authors argue that the placement of the first four rhyme groups in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; suggests that they had distinct codas, reconstructed as labiovelars and .
Most reconstructions posit a large number of vowels to distinguish the many &quot;Qieyun&quot; rhyme classes that occur with some codas, but the number and the values assigned vary widely.

The Chinese linguist Li Rong published a study of the early edition of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; found in 1947, showing that the expanded dictionaries had preserved the phonological structure of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; intact, except for a merger of initials /dʐ/ and /ʐ/.
For example, although the number of rhyme groups increased from 193 in the earlier dictionary to 206 in the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, the differences are limited to splitting rhyme groups based on the presence or absence of a medial glide .

However the preface of the recovered &quot;Qieyun&quot; suggests that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations.
Most linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere.
For example, the &quot;Qieyun&quot; distinguished three rhyme groups 支, 脂 and 之 (all pronounced &quot;zhī&quot; in modern Chinese), although 支 and 脂 were not distinguished in parts of the north, while 脂 and 之 rhymed in the south.
The three groups are treated as &quot;tongyong&quot; in the &quot;Guangyun&quot; and have merged in all modern varieties. 
Although Karlgren&#x27;s identification of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; system with a Sui-Tang standard is no longer accepted, the fact that it contains more distinctions than any single contemporary form of speech means that it retains more information about earlier stages of the language, and is a major component in the reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology.

==&quot;Pingshui&quot; rhyme categories==

From early in the Tang dynasty, candidates in the imperial examination were required to compose poetry and rhymed prose in conformance with the rhyme categories of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;.
However, the fine distinctions made by the &quot;Qieyun&quot; were found overly restrictive by poets, and Xu Jingzong and others suggested more relaxed rhyming rules.
The () system of 106 rhyme groups, first codified during the Jin dynasty, eventually became the prescribed system for the imperial examination.
It became the standard for official rhyme books, and was also used as the classification system for such reference works as the &quot;Peiwen Yunfu&quot;.

The rhyme groups are the same as the groups of the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, with a few exceptions:
* The group is merged with .
* The rising and departing tone groups corresponding to were merged into the and groups.
* The groups and , which were in the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, and in complementary distribution, were split between the two preceding groups.

Yan Zhengqing&#x27;s &quot;Yunhai jingyuan&quot; () was the first rime dictionary of multisyllabic words rather than single characters.
Though no longer extant, it served as the model for a series of encyclopedic dictionaries of literary words and phrases organized by rhyme groups, culminating in the &quot;Peiwen Yunfu&quot; (1711).

==Vernacular dictionaries==

A side-effect of foreign rule of northern China between the 10th and 14th centuries was a weakening of many of the old traditions. New genres of vernacular literature such as the &quot;qu&quot; and &quot;sanqu&quot; poetry appeared, as well as the &quot;Zhongyuan Yinyun&quot;, created by Zhōu Déqīng () in 1324 as a guide to the rhyming conventions of &quot;qu&quot;. The &quot;Zhongyuan Yinyun&quot; was a radical departure from the rhyme table tradition, with the entries grouped into 19 rhyme classes each identified by a pair of exemplary characters. These rhyme classes combined rhymes from different tones, whose parallelism was implicit in the ordered of the &quot;Guangyun&quot; rhymes. The rhyme classes are subdivided by tone and then into groups of homophones, with no other indication of pronunciation. The dictionary reflects contemporaneous northern speech, with the even tone divided in upper and lower tones, and the loss of the Middle Chinese final stops. Such syllables, formerly grouped in the entering tone, are distributed between the other tones, but placed after the other syllables with labels such as ( &#x27;entering tone makes departing tone&#x27;).

The early Ming dictionary &quot;Yùnluè yìtōng&quot; () by Lan Mao was based on the &quot;Zhongyuan Yinyun&quot;, but arranged the homophone groups according to a fixed order of initials, which were listed in a mnemonic poem in the &quot;ci&quot; form.
However, there could still be multiple homophone groups under a given rhyme group, tone and initial, as medial glides were not considered part of the rhyme.
Further innovations are found in a rime dictionary from the late 16th century describing the Fuzhou dialect, which is preserved, together with a later redaction, in the &quot;Qi Lin Bayin&quot;.
This work enumerates the finals of the dialect, differentiated by both medial and rhyme, and classifies each homophone group uniquely by final, initial and tone.
Both finals and initials are listed in poems.

==Tangut==

Tangut was the language of the Western Xia state (1038–1227), centred on the area of modern Gansu.
The language had been extinct for four centuries when an extensive corpus of documents in the logographic Tangut script were discovered in the early 20th century.
One of the sources used to reconstruct the Tangut language is the &quot;Sea of Characters&quot; (), a rhyme dictionary written entirely in Tangut, but with the same structure as the Chinese dictionaries.
The dictionary consists of one volume each for the Tangut level and rising tones, with a third volume of &quot;mixed category&quot; characters, whose significance is unclear.
As with the Chinese dictionaries, each volume is divided into rhymes, and then into homophone groups separated by a small circle.
The pronunciation of the first Tangut character in each homophone group is given by a &quot;fanqie&quot; formula using a pair of Tangut characters.
Mikhail Sofronov applied Chen Li&#x27;s method to these &quot;fanqie&quot; to construct the system of Tangut initials and finals.

<text>The United States National Cemetery System is a system of 164 military cemeteries in the United States and its territories. The authority to create military burial places came during the American Civil War, in an act passed by the U.S. Congress on July 17, 1862. By the end of 1862, 12 national cemeteries had been established. Two of the nation&#x27;s most iconic military cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, and Gettysburg National Cemetery, under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, were established in 1864 and 1863, respectively.

==National Cemetery Administration==
The National Cemetery Administration of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) maintains 148 national cemeteries as well as the Nationwide Grave-site Locator, which can be used to find burial locations of American military Veterans through their searchable website. The Department of the Army maintains two national cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery and United States Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Home National Cemetery. The National Park Service (NPS) maintains 14 national cemeteries associated with historic sites and battlefields.

The American Battle Monuments Commission, an independent agency of the executive branch, established by Congress in 1923, maintains 26 American military cemeteries and other memorials outside the United States.

==History==
Twelve national cemeteries were established in 1862. A total of 34 were established during the Civil War from 1861 to 1865. Additional cemeteries were set up after the United States Civil War by Edmund Burke Whitman. Congress passed additional laws to establish and protect national cemeteries in 1867. The National Cemetery Administration lists a total of 73 Civil War-Era National Cemeteries from 1861 to 1868.

Final military honors are provided for qualified Veterans by volunteer veteran or National Guard details known as Memorial Honor Details (MHD), upon application by family members through their choice of mortuary handling the deceased.

*Please note that the year listed is the official date of establishment listed by the VA. This may differ from the year of the first burial, the oldest remains, the year the land was acquired, etc. Many post cemeteries have been given national cemetery status as late as 2020, which is considerably later than the original cemetery. For example, Vancouver Barracks post cemetery was established in 1849 and became a national cemetery in 2020—one of 11 cemeteries transferred from the Army to NCA in 2019–2020 per Exec. Order No. 13781, 2017.

<doc id="479942" wikidata="Q162153" url="?curid=479942" title="Asclepias">
<text>Asclepias is a genus of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants known as milkweeds, named for their latex, a milky substance containing cardiac glycosides termed cardenolides, exuded where cells are damaged. Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides. However, as with many such plants, some species feed upon milkweed leaves or the nectar from their flowers. A noteworthy feeder on milkweeds is the monarch butterfly, which uses and requires certain milkweeds as host plants for their larvae.

The &quot;Asclepias&quot; genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.

The genus was formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, who named it after Asclepius, the Greek god of healing.

==Flowers==


Members of the genus produce some of the most complex flowers in the plant kingdom, comparable to orchids in complexity. Five petals reflex backwards revealing a gynostegium surrounded by a five-membrane corona. The corona is composed of a five-paired hood-and-horn structure with the hood acting as a sheath for the inner horn. Glands holding pollinia are found between the hoods. The size, shape and color of the horns and hoods are often important identifying characteristics for species in the genus &quot;Asclepias&quot;.

Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner. Pollen is grouped into complex structures called pollinia (or &quot;pollen sacs&quot;), rather than being individual grains or tetrads, as is typical for most plants. The feet or mouthparts of flower-visiting insects, such as bees, wasps, and butterflies, slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers. The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect, so that a pair of pollen sacs can be pulled free when the pollinator flies off, assuming the insect is large enough to produce the necessary pulling force (if not, the insect may become trapped and die). Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure, in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit. Large-bodied hymenopterans (bees, wasps) are the most common and best pollinators, accounting for over 50% of all &quot;Asclepias&quot; pollination, whereas monarch butterflies are poor pollinators of milkweed.


&quot;Asclepias&quot; species produce their seeds in pods termed follicles. The seeds, which are arranged in overlapping rows, bear a cluster of white, silky, filament-like hairs known as the coma (often referred to by other names such as pappus, &quot;floss&quot;, &quot;plume&quot;, or &quot;silk&quot;). The follicles ripen and split open, and the seeds, each carried by its coma, are blown by the wind. Some, but not all, milkweeds also reproduce by clonal (or vegetative) reproduction.

== Selected species ==

There are also 12 species of &quot;Asclepias&quot; in South America, among them: &quot;A. barjoniifolia&quot;, &quot;A. boliviensis&quot;, &quot;A. curassavica&quot;, &quot;A. mellodora&quot;, &quot;A. candida&quot;, &quot;A. flava&quot;, and &quot;A. pilgeriana&quot;.

==Ecology==
Milkweeds are an important nectar source for native bees, wasps, and other nectar-seeking insects, though non-native honey bees commonly get trapped in the stigmatic slits and die. Milkweeds are also the larval food source for monarch butterflies and their relatives, as well as a variety of other herbivorous insects (including numerous beetles, moths, and true bugs) specialized to feed on the plants despite their chemical defenses.

Milkweeds use three primary defenses to limit damage caused by caterpillars: hairs on the leaves (trichomes), cardenolide toxins, and latex fluids. Data from a DNA study indicate that, generally, more recently evolved milkweed species (&quot;derived&quot; in botany parlance) use these preventive strategies less but grow faster than older species, potentially regrowing faster than caterpillars can consume them.

Research indicates that the very high cardenolide content of &quot;Asclepias linaria&quot; reduces the impact of the &quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot; (OE) parasite on the monarch butterfly, &quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;. The OE parasite causes holes to form in the wings of fully developed monarch butterflies. This causes weakened endurance and an inability to migrate. The parasite only infects monarchs when they are larvae and caterpillars, but the detriment is when they are in their butterfly form. By contrast, some species of &quot;Asclepias&quot; are extremely poor sources of cardenolides, such as &quot;Asclepias fascicularis&quot;, &quot;Asclepias tuberosa&quot;, and &quot;Asclepias angustifolia&quot;.

=== Monarch butterfly conservation and milkweeds ===
The leaves of &quot;Asclepias&quot; species are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae and some other milkweed butterflies. These plants are often used in butterfly gardening and monarch waystations in an effort to help increase the dwindling monarch population.

However, some milkweed species are not suitable for butterfly gardens and monarch waystations. For example, &quot;A. curassavica&quot;, or tropical milkweed, is often planted as an ornamental in butterfly gardens outside of its native range of Mexico and Central America. Year-round plantings of this species in the United States are controversial and criticised, as they may lead to new overwintering sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the consequent year-round breeding of monarchs. This is thought to adversely affect migration patterns, and to cause a dramatic build-up of the dangerous parasite, &quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot;. New research also has shown that monarch larvae reared on tropical milkweed show reduced migratory development (reproductive diapause), and when migratory adults are exposed to tropical milkweed, it stimulates reproductive tissue growth.

Because of this, it is most often suggested to grow milkweeds that are native to the geographical area they are planted in to prevent negative impacts on monarch butterflies.

Monarch caterpillars do not favor butterfly weed (&quot;A. tuberosa&quot;), perhaps because the leaves of that milkweed species contain very little cardenolide. Some other milkweeds may have similar characteristics.

==Uses==
Milkweeds are not grown commercially in large scale, but the plants have had many uses throughout human history. Milkweeds have a long history of medicinal, every day, and military use. The Omaha people from Nebraska, the Menomin from Wisconsin and upper Michigan, the Dakota from Minnesota, and the Ponca people from Nebraska, traditionally used common milkweed (&quot;A. syriaca&quot;) for medicinal purposes.
The bast fibers of some species can be used for rope. The Miwok people of northern California used heart-leaf milkweed (&quot;A. cordifolia&quot;) for its stems, which they dried and used for cords, strings and ropes.

The fine, silky fluff attached to milkweed seeds, which allows them to be distributed long distances on the wind, is known as floss. Milkweed floss is incredibly difficult to spin due to how short and smooth the filaments are, but blending it with as little as 25% wool or other fiber can produce workable yarn. 

A study of the insulative properties of various materials found that milkweed floss was outperformed by other materials in terms of insulation, loft, and lumpiness, but it scored well when mixed with down feathers. The milkweed filaments from the coma (the &quot;floss&quot;) are hollow and coated with wax, and have good insulation qualities. During World War II, more than of milkweed floss was collected in the US as a substitute for kapok in life jackets. Milkweed is grown commercially as a hypoallergenic filling for pillows and as insulation for winter coats. Using milkweed floss for these purposes could provide a plant-based alternative to down and promote the growth of milkweed in areas where it has declined, though there is some concern that the environmental impacts could be negative if monoculture is used.
&quot;Asclepias&quot; is also known as &quot;Silk of America&quot; which is a strand of common milkweed (&quot;A. syriaca&quot;) gathered mainly in the valley of the Saint Lawrence River in Canada. Milkweed floss can be used in thermal insulation and acoustic insulation. The floss is also highly buoyant and water-repellent, but absorbs oil readily. Due to its oil-absorbing properties, it can be used for oil spill cleanup.
 and during World War II both Nazi Germany and the US attempted to use it as a source of natural rubber, although no record of large-scale success has been found.

Many milkweed species also contain cardiac glycoside poisons that inhibit animal cells from maintaining a proper K+, Ca2+ concentration gradient. As a result, many peoples of South America and Africa used arrows poisoned with these glycosides to fight and hunt more effectively. Some milkweeds are toxic enough to cause death when animals consume large quantities of the plant. Some milkweeds also cause mild dermatitis in some who come in contact with them. Nonetheless, some species can be made edible if properly processed.

<doc id="479944" wikidata="Q135325" url="?curid=479944" title="Alcoa">
<text>Alcoa Corporation (an acronym for &quot;Aluminum Company of America&quot;) is an American industrial corporation. It is the world&#x27;s eighth-largest producer of aluminum. Alcoa conducts operations in 10 countries. Alcoa is a major producer of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling.

Alcoa emerged in 1888 as the brainchild of Charles Martin Hall, with the funding of Alfred E. Hunt and Arthur Vining Davis. Alcoa was the first mass producer of aluminum. Before Alcoa&#x27;s formation, aluminum was difficult to refine and, as a result, was more expensive than silver or gold. In 1886, Hall discovered the Hall–Héroult process, the first inexpensive technique for refining aluminum, drastically reducing the price of aluminum while increasing its availability. Hall approached Hunt and Davis to form a company to bring his process to market; the three founded Alcoa as the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which expanded quickly. Hunt died in 1898 after fighting in the Spanish–American War. The company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907. Alcoa increased production by 40% during World War I and was an essential supplier of aluminum in World War II.

In the 2000s, Alcoa purchased numerous competitors, including Reynolds Group Holdings (makers of Reynolds Wrap). On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. split into two entities: a new one called Alcoa Corporation, which is engaged in the mining and manufacture of raw aluminum, and the renaming of Alcoa Inc. to Arconic Inc., which processes aluminum and other metals. Alcoa has been criticized for its lax environmental record, but it no longer ranks highly as one of the worst polluters in the United States.

== History ==
===Hall&#x27;s patent===
In 1886, Charles Martin Hall, a graduate of Oberlin College, discovered the process of smelting aluminum, almost simultaneously with Paul Héroult in France. He realized that by passing an electric current through a bath of cryolite and aluminum oxide, the then semi-rare metal aluminum remained as a byproduct. This discovery, now called the Hall–Héroult process, along with the Bayer process, are the dominant processes for production of aluminum from bauxite ore.
Fewer than ten sites in the United States and Europe produced aluminum at the time. In 1887, Hall agreed to try his process at the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company plant in Lockport, New York. Still, it was not used, and Hall left after one year, teaming up with Alfred E. Hunt to form a new company.

After graduating from Amherst College in 1888, Arthur Vining Davis joined the new venture because Arthur&#x27;s father knew Alfred Hunt. At the time, aluminum sold at almost $5 per pound, making it too expensive to be used commercially. They were determined to lower the cost of production using Charles Hall&#x27;s ideas; Hall, Davis, and others worked 12-hour days together for months on the experiments. Their first commercial aluminum pour was on Thanksgiving Day in 1888.

===Pittsburgh Reduction Company===
The &quot;Pittsburgh Reduction Company&quot; began with an experimental smelting plant on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with Hunt as president and Hall as vice president. In 1891, the company began production in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Davis was named general manager and appointed to the board of directors in 1892. In 1895, a third site opened at Niagara Falls.

===Hunt&#x27;s departure===
Hunt left the company in 1898 to fight in the Spanish–American War. While in Puerto Rico, he contracted Malaria. Less than a year after his return to the states, he died from complications of the disease at age 44.

By about 1903, after a settlement with Hall&#x27;s former employer, and while its patents were in force, the company was the only legal supplier of aluminum in the United States.

By 1902, New Kensington consisted of 173,000 sq. feet on 15 acres with 276 employees. The company operated hydropower and reduction plants in Niagara Falls, NY (1895), Shawinigan Falls, Quebec (Northern Aluminum Company), mining operations in Bauxite, AR (1901), and reduction facilities in East St. Louis, IL (1902). &quot;The Aluminum Company of America&quot; became the firm&#x27;s new name on January 1, 1907. Davis was named company president in 1910 when the acronym &quot;Alcoa&quot; was coined. Hall remained a vice president until he died in 1914. It was given as a name to two of the locales where major corporate facilities were located (although one of these has since been changed), and in 1999, was adopted as the official corporate name.

From 1902 until 1915, additional plants in Massena, New York (1903), Alcoa, Tennessee (1911), Edgewater, New Jersey (1915), Badin, North Carolina (1915) came online while New Kensington had 31 buildings in the complex housing six departments (tubes, sheets, rods, bar and wire, extrusion, jobbing, foil) and two subsidiaries (Aluminum Cooking Utensil Company and Aluminum Seal Company). In 1907, it created the &quot;company town&quot; of Pine Grove, New York, for workers outside Massena. In Badin, Alcoa, Maryville and other locations, the company funded the construction of schools, parks, playgrounds, and medical facilities.

=== The World Wars ===
Historian George David Smith notes that &quot;war was good to Alcoa.&quot; By the end of World War I Alcoa&#x27;s New Kensington facility accounted for 3,292 workers—a fifth of the local population—and covered over 1 million square feet of manufacturing space on 75 acres. The war enabled Alcoa to increase production by 40% and to export some ninety million pounds to the Western Allies.

After WWI, Alcoa obtained the rights to Alfred Wilm&#x27;s duralumin patent, which led to additional research into other aluminum alloys. By 1923, Alcoa&#x27;s New Kensington, Pennsylvania plant was using horizontal extrusion presses, with preheated billets, for aerospace and construction applications. One of the first industrial uses was for the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, followed ten years later with airplane applications. The &quot;Northern Aluminum Company&quot; in Quebec was renamed the Aluminum Company of Canada (ALCAN) in 1925. They were responsible for the rapid development of Arvida, Quebec, a remote area 250 km north of Quebec City. Infrastructure was necessary to support the workforce required by the aluminum plant, so the company funded the construction of schools, parks, playgrounds, and medical facilities.

Davis was named chairman of Alcoa&#x27;s board of directors in 1928 and remained in that role for thirty years until his retirement.

In 1938, the Justice Department charged Alcoa with illegal monopolization and demanded that the company be dissolved. The case of &quot;United States v. Alcoa&quot; was settled six years later.

Aluminum products were of crucial use during World War II. A German U-Boat sank the &quot;SS Alcoa Puritan&quot; in 1942, as it carried a load of bauxite ore.

===Alumax===
In 1998, Alcoa acquired Alumax in a cash and share deal for $2.8 billion. Alcoa paid $50 a share in cash for half of the shares and 0.6975 Alcoa share for each of the remaining Alumax shares. Alcoa also assumed $1 billion in debt. Alumax&#x27;s assets included the Eastalco aluminum smelter in Adamstown, Maryland, the Intalco aluminum smelter in Ferndale, Washington, and the Kawneer brand of building construction products.

===Reynolds===
In 2000, Alcoa acquired Reynolds Metals Co. in an all-share deal for $4.5 billion. To clear anti-competition regulatory hurdles, Alcoa was required to sell Reynolds&#x27;s 25% interest in a Washington smelter and all of Reynolds&#x27;s alumina refineries. Reynolds owned a 56% interest in the Worsley alumina refinery in Australia, a 50% interest in a refinery in Germany, and a 100% interest in a Texas refinery. Alcoa also planned to sell Reynolds&#x27;s construction and distribution business and the company&#x27;s $400 million transportation business. Alcoa sold its packaging and consumer business, formerly called Reynolds Metals, to the Rank Group for $2.7 billion in 2008.

===Cordant===
In 2000, Alcoa also purchased Cordant Technologies Inc. for $57 a share in cash, or $2.3 billion, and assumed $685 million of Cordant&#x27;s debt for a total transaction value of $2.9 billion. Cordant&#x27;s divisions included Huck Fasteners, Jacobson Mfg. Co., Continental/Midland Group, its 85% interest in Howmet International Inc., and Thiokol Corporation. In 2001, Alcoa sold Thiokol for $2.9 billion to Alliant Techsystems (ATK).

===Chalco===
Alcoa purchased an 8% stake of Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco) in 2001. It tried to form a strategic alliance with China&#x27;s largest aluminum producer, at its Pingguo facility; however, it was unsuccessful. Alcoa sold their stake in Chalco on September 12, 2007, for around $2 billion.

===Chemicals===
In 2004, Alcoa&#x27;s specialty chemicals business was sold to two private equity firms led by Rhône Group for an enterprise value of $342 million, which included the assumption of debt and other unfunded obligations. Rhône Group then changed the name to Almatis, Inc.

===Corporate relocation===
In 2006, Alcoa relocated its top executives from Pittsburgh to New York City while its operational headquarters was still at its Corporate Center in Pittsburgh. Alcoa employed approximately 2,000 people at its Corporate Center in Pittsburgh and 60 at its New York office. Alcoa moved its headquarters back to Pittsburgh effective September 1, 2017, as part of a general consolidation of administrative facilities around the world. In October 2018, Alcoa announced plans to move from Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Shore to a downtown Pittsburgh location.

===Alcan bid===
In May 2007, Alcoa Inc. made a US$27 billion hostile takeover bid for Alcan in an attempt to form the world&#x27;s largest aluminum producer. The bid was withdrawn when Alcan announced a friendly takeover by Rio Tinto in July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcoa-Jul-2007-SC-TO-T/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2008, Klaus Kleinfeld was appointed CEO of Alcoa, succeeding Alain Belda. On April 23, 2010, Alcoa&#x27;s board of directors selected Kleinfeld to the office of chairman, following Belda&#x27;s planned retirement.

===Recycling===
On July 16, 2012, Alcoa announced that it would take over full ownership and operation of Evermore Recycling and make it part of Alcoa&#x27;s Global Packaging group. Evermore Recycling is a leader in used beverage can recycling, purchasing more recycled cans than any other group worldwide.

In June 2013, Alcoa announced it would permanently close its Fusina primary aluminum smelter in Venice, Italy, where production had been curtailed since June 2010.

On January 9, 2014, Alcoa settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice over charges of bribing Bahraini officials. Under the settlement terms, they will pay the SEC $175 million to settle the charges. To resolve the criminal claims with the DoJ, Alcoa World Alumina (AWA, a company within Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals) is pleading guilty to one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). AWA will pay the DoJ $223 million in five equal installments over the next four years, bringing the company&#x27;s total bill for the scandal to $384 million.

===Company split===
In June 2016, Alcoa Inc. announced plans to split itself into two companies: Alcoa Inc would be renamed as Arconic and would take over the business of designing and building processed metal parts, primarily for the automotive and aerospace industries; a new company, Alcoa Corporation, would be set up and spun out of the remainder of Alcoa Inc. and retain the Alcoa name. Alcoa Corp. would continue the mining, smelting, and refining of raw aluminum. The split was completed on November 1, 2016.

== Environmental record ==

In February 1999, Alcoa cleaned soils and sediment contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and lead at the York Oil federal Superfund site in Moira, New York, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency. The site, a former waste oil recycling storage facility, accepted waste oil from several companies, including Alcoa. The facility was improperly managed and operated, and as a result, soils on the York Oil Property and nearby wetlands sediments and groundwater were contaminated. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Superfund Unilateral Order on December 31, 1998, requiring Alcoa to excavate, treat and dispose of the contaminated wetlands sediments.

In April 2003, Alcoa Inc. agreed to spend an estimated $330 million to install a new coal-fired power plant with state-of-the-art pollution controls to eliminate the vast majority of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions from the power plant at Alcoa&#x27;s aluminum production facility in Rockdale, Texas. The settlement was the ninth case the Bush administration pursued to bring the coal-fired power plant industry into full compliance with the Clean Air Act. Alcoa was unlawfully operating at the Rockdale facility since it overhauled the Rockdale power plant without installing necessary pollution controls and without first obtaining proper permits required by &quot;New Source Review&quot; program of the Clean Air Act.

In 2005, Alcoa was again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and was named as one of the top three most sustainable corporations in the world by Corporate Knights and Innovest Strategic Value Advisors at the World Economic Forum meeting.

In 2008, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Alcoa 15th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (13 million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. More recently Alcoa ranked first in the United States even though they had reduced their emissions to less than 5 million pounds in 2014. Alcoa&#x27;s most recently published ranking has dropped to 72nd based on 2020 data.

== Operations by country ==
=== Jamaica ===
Alcoa formed the Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica subsidiary on the island in 1959, shipping their first load of bauxite in 1963 from Rocky Point. Later in 1972, Alcoa established a 500,000 tonne per year refinery that processes bauxite into alumina. They have continued to upgrade the plant through the years, and it is now capable of 1,425,000 tonnes per year. In 1988, the Jamaican government gained a 50% share in the subsidiary and renamed the operation to Jamalco, Alcoa being the managing partner. Expansion of the operation in 2007 resulted in Alcoa owning 55% of the operation. Alcoa continues to mine bauxite in the Jamaican parishes of Clarendon and Manchester, while competitors&#x27; operations occur in nearby parishes.

=== Dominican Republic ===
In the 1970s, Alcoa negotiated with the Dominican Republic government concerning its bauxite mining operations. The U.S. Department of State expressed concerns that the Dominican Republic might follow Jamaica&#x27;s lead in imposing higher taxes on Alcoa&#x27;s operations. This period was marked by intense discussions and negotiations regarding the taxation and revenue from bauxite mining, highlighting the complexities of international business operations and the impact of global commodity markets on local economies.

Alcoa Road, also known as El Aceitillar, is a significant part of Alcoa&#x27;s legacy in the Dominican Republic. Originally constructed for a bauxite mine, it now leads to Sierra de Bahoruco National Park. This area offers an opportunity to observe endemic species and serves as a reminder of the environmental dimensions of industrial operations. Alcoa Road&#x27;s transition from an access route for mining to a gateway for environmental observation underscores the evolving relationship between industry and conservation.

=== Ghana ===
Alcoa&#x27;s affiliate in Ghana, the Volta Aluminum Company, was completely closed between May 2003 and early 2006 due to problems with its electricity supply.

=== Guinea ===
Alcoa is a major owner of the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée through Halco Mining, together with Rio Tinto Alcan and the Guinean government. Guinea is the second global producer of bauxite and it is said to have half of the world&#x27;s reserves.

=== Iceland ===

In 2005, Alcoa began construction in Iceland on Alcoa Fjarðaál, a state-of-the-art aluminum smelter and the company&#x27;s first greenfield smelter in more than 20 years, albeit under heavy criticism by local and international NGOs related to a controversial dam project exclusively dedicated to supplying electricity to this smelter.
The Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland was completed in June 2007 and brought into full operation the following April. The plant processes 940 tons of aluminum a day, with a capacity of 346,000 metric tons a year, making it Alcoa&#x27;s second largest capacity smelter. For power, the plant relies on the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant, constructed and operated by the state-owned Landsvirkjun specifically for the smelting operation. That project was subject to controversy due to its impact on the environment.

In 2006, Alcoa and the government of Iceland signed an agreement on instigating a thorough feasibility study for a new 250,000 tpy (Tons Per Year) smelter in Bakki by Húsavík in Northern Iceland. In October 2011, the proposed project was dropped because &quot;the power availability and proposed pricing would not support an aluminum smelter&quot;.

Alcoa announced plans to close the office in Reykjavik.

===Russia===
In 2005 Alcoa acquired two major production facilities in Russia, at Samara and Belaya Kalitva.

=== Wales ===
On November 21, 2006, Alcoa announced that it planned to close the Waunarlwydd works in Swansea, with the loss of 298 jobs. Production ceased at the Swansea plant on January 27, 2007. A small site closure team worked until December 31, 2008. Alcoa still owns the site, but it is now managed locally and renamed Westfield Industrial Park. Several of the large buildings are leased out to local businesses.

=== Australia ===
Alcoa operates bauxite mines, alumina refineries, and aluminum smelters through Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), a joint venture between Alumina Limited and Alcoa. Alcoa operates two bauxite mines in Western Australia—the Huntly and Willowdale mines. Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals owns and operates three alumina refineries in Western Australia: Kwinana, Pinjarra, and Wagerup. The Wagerup expansion plans were put on hold due to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. In January 2024, Alcoa announced it would cease alumina production at its Kwinana refinery that year. Two aluminum smelters are also operated in the state of Victoria at Portland and Point Henry; the Point Henry smelter was scheduled to be closed in August 2014. Alcoa Australia Rolled Products, a 100% Alcoa Inc. venture, operates two rolling mills. The Point Henry Rolling Mill in Victoria and the Yennora Rolling Mill in N.S.W. have a combined rolling capacity of approx. 200,000 tonnes. Alcoa uses 12,600 GWh, or 15% of Victoria&#x27;s electricity annually.

Alcoa&#x27;s Western Australian Wagerup plant has a troubled history in the context of claims that pollution from the plant has harmed the health of members of the adjacent local community.

Alcoa announced it would acquire Alumina for $2.2 billion in an all-stock deal in February 2024. As part of the deal Alcoa would gain full ownership of AWAC. The acquisition was completed in August.

=== United States ===
On January 3, 2003, Alcoa opened its new operations headquarters on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. This move came about after it donated its 50-year-old skyscraper headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh to the Regional Development Authority.

Alcoa created a plant just outside Maryville in Blount County, Tennessee. To support the factory, Alcoa built a small city and named it as such. The Alcoa Tenn Federal Credit Union was the first employee-created credit union in the state. The plant is no longer an Alcoa business.

Alcoa&#x27;s Massena West plant is the longest-operating smelter in the United States, continuously operating since 1902. The Reynolds Aluminum Plant became Massena East when the companies merged in 2000.

Alcoa had a smelting plant in Badin, North Carolina from 1917 to 2007 and continued a hydroelectric power operation there until February 1, 2017, when the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project was sold to Cube Hydro.

Alcoa also operates an aluminum smelting plant of similar size to the one in Tennessee in Warrick County, Indiana, just east of Newburgh. Vectren Energy operates a coal power plant on the site to provide electricity. In 2021, Alcoa retained the aluminum smelter and generating station while selling the rest of the facility to Kaiser Aluminum. This sale included the cast house, ingot facilities, hot mill, cold mills, and finishing mills.

Alcoa maintains several Research and Development Centers in the United States. The largest one, Alcoa Technical Center, is located East of its Pittsburgh Headquarters at Alcoa Center, Pennsylvania. The &quot;Tech Center&quot; is as large as some college campuses, has its own zip code, and maintains an extensive intellectual and physical resource for innovation. Alcoa&#x27;s extensive safety program continuously improves safety at the Tech Center. After Paul O&#x27;Neill became Alcoa&#x27;s CEO in 1987, Alcoa became one of the safest companies in the world, despite the aluminum industry&#x27;s inherent risks.

Alcoa plans to close offices in Richmond, Virginia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Chicago.

===Alcoa Steamship Company===


The &quot;Alcoa Steamship Company&quot; was a subsidiary of ALCOA since the company was formed in 1917.

==Lobbying==
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Alcoa spent over $1 million to lobby the U.S. government for sanctions against Russian aluminum companies.

== In popular culture ==
From 1955 to 1957, Alcoa sponsored &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, an anthology television series on NBC. The series ran for 48 episodes across two seasons and would feature an advertisement for Alcoa products before the credits of each program. The series featured some of the early work of director Sidney Lumet, the five-time Oscar nominee known for the 1957 version of 12 Angry Men. 

Between 1957 and 1960, the Alcoa-sponsored Alcoa Theatre, an NBC anthology television series that went on to win three Emmys. From 1961 to 1963, Alcoa sponsored a third anthology television series on ABC. Alcoa Premiere was hosted by Fred Astaire and received 14 Emmy nominations during its two-year run.

Alcoa is portrayed as the main sponsor of the 1953 CBS program &quot;See It Now&quot; in George Clooney&#x27;s Academy Award–nominated 2005 film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;.

<doc id="479945" wikidata="Q5020832" url="?curid=479945" title="2004 California Proposition 58">
<text>Proposition 58 was a California ballot proposition on the March 2, 2004 ballot. It passed with 4,535,084 (71.2%) votes in favor and 1,841,138 (28.8%) against. It was officially called the California Balanced Budget Act. It requires the state legislature to pass a balanced budget every year, which means that budgeted recurrent expenditure, including repayment of past debt, does not exceed estimated revenue. The act does not require that capital works programs be funded out of current revenues. The California Constitution has always allowed bond issues (state debt) for specified capital works, above a certain value. Bond measures must be approved by a statewide ballot.

The Act created a reserve fund called the Budget Stabilization Account in case of future financial trouble. It also prevented the creation of any future bonds to pay off deficits like that in Proposition 57 (the California Economic Recovery Bond Act). Proposition 58 took effect only because Proposition 57 also passed.

Propositions 57 and 58 were the centerpiece of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s plan to resolve California&#x27;s budget problems. Schwarzenegger campaigned heavily for both propositions&#x27; passage.

While Prop 58 was to provide balanced California budgets, the deficits continued in subsequent years, growing larger over time.

== Official summary ==
* Requires enactment of a balanced budget where General Fund expenditures do not exceed estimated General Fund revenues.
* Allows the Governor to proclaim a fiscal emergency in specified circumstances, and submit proposed legislation to address the fiscal emergency.
* Requires the Legislature to stop other action and act on legislation proposed to address the emergency.
* Establishes a budget reserve.
* Provides that the California Economic Recovery Bond Act is for a single object or work.
* Prohibits any future deficit bonds.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:
* Unknown net state fiscal effects, which will vary year by year and depend in part on actions of future Legislatures.
* Reserve provisions may smooth state spending, with reductions during economic expansions and increases during downturns.
* Balanced budget and debt limitation provisions can result in more immediate actions to correct budgetary shortfalls.

<doc id="479948" wikidata="Q2466625" url="?curid=479948" title="Agree to disagree">
<text>To &quot;agree to disagree&quot; is to resolve a conflict (usually a debate or ) by having all parties tolerating but not accepting the opposing positions. It generally occurs when all sides recognize that further conflict would be unnecessary, ineffective or otherwise undesirable.

== Origin ==

In 1770, the phrase &quot;agree to disagree&quot; appeared in print in its modern meaning when, at the death of George Whitefield, John Wesley wrote a memorial sermon which acknowledged but downplayed the two men&#x27;s doctrinal differences:

In a subsequent letter to his brother Charles, Wesley attributed it to Whitefield (presumably George Whitefield): &quot;If you agree with me, well: if not, we can, as Mr. Whitefield used to say, agree to disagree.&quot; Whitefield had used it in a letter as early as June 29, 1750.

Though Whitefield and Wesley appear to have popularized the expression in its usual meaning, it had appeared in print much earlier (1608) in a work by James Anderton, writing under the name of John Brereley, Priest, although his usage lacks the implication of tolerance of differing beliefs.

And as our learned adversaries do thus agree to disagree in their owne translations, mutually condemning (as before) each other... (&quot;The Protestants Apologie for the Roman Church Deuided into three seuerall Tractes&quot;)

The phrase &quot;agree to differ&quot; appeared in the early part of the 18th century in a sermon by John Piggott: &quot;And now why should we not agree to differ, without either enmity or scorn?&quot; (&quot;Sermon on Union and Peace, preach&#x27;d to several Congregations, April 17, 1704&quot;).

<doc id="479949" wikidata="Q191288" url="?curid=479949" title="The Satanic Verses">
<text>The Satanic Verses is the fourth novel from the Indian-British writer Salman Rushdie. First published in September 1988, the book was inspired by the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. As with his previous books, Rushdie used magical realism and relied on contemporary events and people to create his characters. The title refers to the Satanic Verses, a group of Quranic verses about three pagan Meccan goddesses: Allāt, Al-Uzza, and Manāt. The part of the story that deals with the satanic verses was based on accounts from the historians al-Waqidi and al-Tabari.

The book was a 1988 Booker Prize finalist (losing to Peter Carey&#x27;s &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;), and won the 1988 Whitbread Award for novel of the year. Timothy Brennan called the work &quot;the most ambitious novel yet published to deal with the immigrant experience in Britain&quot;.

The book and its perceived blasphemy motivated Islamic extremist bombings, killings, and riots and sparked a debate about censorship and religiously motivated violence. Fearing unrest, the Rajiv Gandhi government banned the importation of the book into India. In 1989, Supreme Leader of Iran Ruhollah Khomeini declared a fatwa against Rushdie, resulting in several failed assassination attempts on the author, who was granted police protection by the UK government, and attacks on connected individuals, including the Japanese translator Hitoshi Igarashi who was stabbed to death in 1991. Assassination attempts against Rushdie continued, including an attempt on his life 34 years later, in August 2022.

==Plot==

&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; consists of a frame narrative, using elements of magical realism, interlaced with a series of sub-plots that are narrated as dream visions experienced by one of the protagonists. The frame narrative involves Indian expatriates in contemporary England. The two protagonists, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, are both actors of Indian Muslim background. Farishta is a Bollywood superstar who specialises in playing Hindu deities (the character is partly based on Indian film stars Amitabh Bachchan and N. T. Rama Rao). Chamcha, an Anglophile emigrant who has cut himself off from his Indian heritage, works as a voiceover artist in England.

At the beginning of the novel, both are trapped in a plane hijacked by Sikh separatists, flying from India to Britain. The separatists land the plane and take many of the passengers hostage for months, but after negotiations fail, the separatists force the plane to take off and detonate it over the English Channel. While everyone else aboard the plane perishes, Farishta and Chamcha are magically saved. In a miraculous transformation, Farishta takes on the personality of the archangel Gabriel (referred to as Gibreel) and Chamcha that of a devil. Farishta develops a halo that occasionally manifests, while Chamcha grows horns and goatlike legs. After both men take refuge with an elderly English Argentine woman, Chamcha is arrested and is subjected to police abuse as a suspected illegal immigrant.

Both characters struggle to piece their lives back together. Farishta seeks and finds his lost love, the English mountaineer Alleluia &quot;Allie&quot; Cone. However, their relationship is overshadowed by his growing sense that he is the Angel Gibreel and other symptoms of schizophrenia. After attempting unsuccessfully to evangelize in London, Farishta steps into the street and is hit by the car of movie producer S.S. Sisodia. Sisodia takes Farishta to get treated for schizophrenia with Allie and proposes a plan to revitalize Farishta&#x27;s movie career. Meanwhile, Chamcha is fired from voice acting and becomes distressed by his increasingly goatlike appearance and behavior, as well as by the revelation that his estranged wife Pamela and friend Jamshed &quot;Jumpy&quot; Joshi have begun a relationship under the impression that Chamcha perished in the explosion. Jumpy convinces the Shaandaars, a family operating a hostel, to let Chamcha stay with them. Chamcha&#x27;s devil-like appearance intensifies until he recognizes his anger at Farishta for not defending him from arrest and abandoning him after the plane crash, after which he is transformed back into his human shape.

Chamcha wants to take revenge on Farishta for having forsaken him after their joint fall from the hijacked plane and resents him for his successful return to movie stardom. Aware of Farishta&#x27;s pathological jealousy and paranoid schizophrenia, Chamcha harasses Farishta and Allie over the phone, using different vocal impressions and intimate details of Allie&#x27;s life to insinuate that Allie is unfaithful to Farishta. Provoked by Chamcha&#x27;s calls, Farishta destroys his relationship with Allie. 

Jumpy, Pamela, and Chamcha attend a rally in defense of Dr. Uhuru Simba, a controversial Black activist seemingly framed for a series of gruesome serial killings. Simba dies suspiciously in police custody, and Sikh youth on community patrol catch the real murderer, a white man. The police plan a cover-up and raid a popular South Asian nightclub, inflaming tensions and leading to riots. Pamela and Jumpy intend to photocopy and distribute compromising information about the police, but during the riots, masked men set fire to the building they are in, destroying the evidence and killing Pamela and Jumpy. During the riots, Farishta believes that the rioters&#x27; flames are the result of his angelic powers. He realises that Chamcha was to blame for the calls, tracking him down to the now-burning Shaandaar hostel with the intent of killing him, but relenting when he sees that Chamcha tried in vain to save Mr. and Mrs. Shandaar from the fire.

Both return to India, Farishta to star in a series of movies that turn out to be unsuccessful and Chamcha to see his estranged father, who is terminally ill. Farishta is discovered to have murdered both Sisodia and Allie and visits Chamcha at his father&#x27;s estate, seemingly about to shoot him, but he turns the gun on himself. Chamcha, who has found not only forgiveness from Farishta but also reconciliation with his estranged father and his own Indian identity, decides to remain in India.

===Dream sequences===
Embedded in this story is a series of half-magic dream vision narratives, ascribed to the mind of Farishta.

One of the sequences is a fictionalised narration of the life of Muhammad (called &quot;Mahound&quot; or &quot;the Messenger&quot; in the novel) in Mecca (called Jahilia in the novel). At its centre is the episode of the so-called satanic verses, in which the prophet first proclaims a revelation requiring the adoption of three of the old polytheistic deities, but later renounces this as an error induced by the Devil. There are also two opponents of the &quot;Messenger&quot;: a priestess, Hind, and a skeptic and satirical poet, Baal. When the prophet returns to Mecca in triumph, Baal goes into hiding in an underground brothel, where the prostitutes assume the identities of the prophet&#x27;s wives. One of the prophet&#x27;s companions escapes to Jahilia and claims that he, doubting the authenticity of the &quot;Messenger&quot;, has subtly altered portions of the Quran as they were dictated to him, seemingly disproving Mahound&#x27;s divine revelation. When Mahound takes over Jahilia, he has Baal and the prostitutes executed, though Hind&#x27;s supernatural machinations are implied to have caused Mahound&#x27;s illness and eventual death.

The second sequence tells the story of Ayesha, an Indian peasant girl who claims to be receiving revelations from the Archangel Gibreel. She entices all her village community to embark on a foot pilgrimage to Mecca, claiming that they will be able to walk across the Arabian Sea. The pilgrimage ends in a catastrophic climax as the believers all walk into the water and disappear, amid disturbingly conflicting testimonies from observers about whether they simply drowned or were in fact miraculously able to cross the sea.

A third dream sequence presents the figure of a fanatic expatriate religious leader, the &quot;Imam&quot;, in a late-20th-century setting, an allusion to Ruhollah Khomeini in his exile in Paris. The Imam forces Farishta, who has assumed the form of the angel Gibreel, to do supernatural battle with the Imam&#x27;s bitter enemy, his exiled homeland&#x27;s empress Ayesha.

==Literary criticism and analysis==
Overall, the book received favourable reviews from literary critics. In a 2003 volume of criticism of Rushdie&#x27;s career, the influential critic Harold Bloom named &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; &quot;Rushdie&#x27;s largest aesthetic achievement&quot;.

Timothy Brennan called the work &quot;the most ambitious novel yet published to deal with the immigrant experience in Britain&quot; that captures the immigrants&#x27; dream-like disorientation and their process of &quot;union-by-hybridization&quot;. The book is seen as &quot;fundamentally a study in alienation&quot;.

Muhammad Mashuq ibn Ally wrote that &quot;&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; is about identity, alienation, rootlessness, brutality, compromise, and conformity. These concepts confront all migrants, disillusioned with both cultures: the one they are in and the one they join. Yet knowing they cannot live a life of anonymity, they mediate between them both. &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; is a reflection of the author&#x27;s dilemmas.&quot; The work is an &quot;albeit surreal, record of its own author&#x27;s continuing identity crisis&quot;. Ally said that the book reveals the author ultimately as &quot;the victim of nineteenth-century British colonialism&quot;. Rushdie himself spoke confirming this interpretation of his book, saying that it was not about Islam, &quot;but about migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, London and Bombay&quot;. He has also said &quot;It&#x27;s a novel which happened to contain a castigation of Western materialism. The tone is comic.&quot;

After the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; controversy developed, some scholars familiar with the book and the whole of Rushdie&#x27;s work, like M. D. Fletcher, saw the reaction as ironic. Fletcher wrote &quot;It is perhaps a relevant irony that some of the major expressions of hostility toward Rushdie came from those about whom and (in some sense) for whom he wrote.&quot; He said the manifestations of the controversy in Britain: 

Rushdie&#x27;s influences have long been a point of interest to scholars examining his work. According to W. J. Weatherby, influences on &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; were listed as James Joyce, Italo Calvino, Franz Kafka, Frank Herbert, Thomas Pynchon, Mervyn Peake, Gabriel García Márquez, Jean-Luc Godard, J. G. Ballard, and William S. Burroughs. According to the author himself, he was inspired to write the novel by the work of Mikhail Bulgakov, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. Angela Carter writes that the novel contains &quot;inventions such as the city of Jahilia, &#x27;built entirely of sand,&#x27; that gives a nod to Calvino and a wink to Frank Herbert&quot;.

Srinivas Aravamudan&#x27;s analysis of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; stressed the satiric nature of the work and held that while it and &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; may appear to be more &quot;comic epic&quot;, &quot;clearly those works are highly satirical&quot; in a similar vein of postmodern satire pioneered by Joseph Heller in &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; continued to exhibit Rushdie&#x27;s penchant for organising his work in terms of parallel stories. Within the book &quot;there are major parallel stories, alternating dream and reality sequences, tied together by the recurring names of the characters in each; this provides intertexts within each novel which comment on the other stories.&quot; &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; also exhibits Rushdie&#x27;s common practice of using allusions to invoke connotative links. Within the book he referenced everything from mythology to &quot;one-liners invoking recent popular culture&quot;.

==Controversy==

The novel has been accused of blasphemy for its reference to the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;. Pakistan banned the book in November 1988. On 12 February 1989, 10,000 protesters gathered against Rushdie and the book in Islamabad, Pakistan. Six protesters were killed in an attack on the American Cultural Center, and an American Express office was ransacked. As the violence spread, the importing of the book was banned in India and it was burned in demonstrations in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, the Commission for Racial Equality and a liberal think tank, the Policy Studies Institute, held seminars on the Rushdie affair. They did not invite the author Fay Weldon, who spoke out against burning books, but did invite Shabbir Akhtar, a Cambridge philosophy graduate who called for &quot;a negotiated compromise&quot; that &quot;would protect Muslim sensibilities against gratuitous provocation&quot;. The journalist and author Andy McSmith wrote at the time &quot;We are witnessing, I fear, the birth of a new and dangerously illiberal &#x27;liberal&#x27; orthodoxy designed to accommodate Dr. Akhtar and his fundamentalist friends.&quot;

In September 2012, Rushdie expressed doubt that &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; would be published today because of a climate of &quot;fear and nervousness&quot;.

===&quot;Fatwa&quot;===
In mid-February 1989, following the violent riot against the book in Pakistan, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Supreme Leader of Iran and a Shiite scholar, issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers, and called for Muslims to point him out to those who can kill him if they cannot themselves. Although the British Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher gave Rushdie round-the-clock police protection, many politicians on both sides were hostile to the author. British Labour MP Keith Vaz led a march through Leicester shortly after he was elected in 1989 calling for the book to be banned, while the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, the party&#x27;s former chairman, called Rushdie an &quot;outstanding villain&quot; whose &quot;public life has been a record of despicable acts of betrayal of his upbringing, religion, adopted home and nationality&quot;.

Journalist Christopher Hitchens defended Rushdie and urged critics to condemn the violence of the &quot;fatwa&quot; instead of blaming the novel or the author. Hitchens considered the &quot;fatwa&quot; to be the opening shot in a cultural war on freedom.

In 2021, the BBC broadcast a two-hour documentary by Mobeen Azhar and Chloe Hadjimatheou, interviewing many of the principal denouncers and defenders of the book from 1988–1989, concluding that campaigns against the book were amplified by minority (racial and religious) politics in England and other countries.

Despite a conciliatory statement by Iran in 1998, and Rushdie&#x27;s declaration that he would stop living in hiding, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported in 2006 that the &quot;fatwa&quot; would remain in place permanently since &quot;fatawa&quot; can only be rescinded by the person who first issued them, and Khomeini had since died.

===Violence, assassinations, and attempted murders===
Hitoshi Igarashi, Rushdie&#x27;s Japanese translator, was found by a cleaning lady, stabbed to death in his office at the University of Tsukuba on 13 July 1991. Ten days prior to Igarashi&#x27;s killing, Rushdie&#x27;s Italian translator Ettore Capriolo was seriously injured by an attacker at his home in Milan by being stabbed multiple times on 3 July 1991. William Nygaard, the Norwegian publisher of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, was critically injured by being shot three times in the back by an assailant on 11 October 1993 in Oslo. Nygaard survived, but spent months in the hospital recovering. The book&#x27;s Turkish translator Aziz Nesin was the intended target of a mob of arsonists who set fire to the Madimak Hotel after Friday prayers on 2 July 1993 in Sivas, Turkey, killing 37 people, mostly Alevi scholars, poets and musicians. Nesin escaped death when the fundamentalist mob failed to recognize him early in the attack. Known as the Sivas massacre, it is remembered by Alevi Turks who gather in Sivas annually and hold silent marches, commemorations and vigils for the slain.

In March 2016, the bounty for the Rushdie fatwa was raised by $600,000 (£430,000). Top Iranian media contributed this sum, adding to the existing $2.8 million already offered. In response, the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature, denounced the death sentence and called it &quot;a serious violation of free speech&quot;. This was the first time it had commented on the issue since the book&#x27;s publication.

On 12 August 2022, Rushdie was attacked onstage while speaking at an event of the Chautauqua Institution. Rushdie suffered four stab wounds to the stomach area of his abdomen, three wounds to the right side of the front part of his neck, one wound to his right eye, one wound to his chest and one wound to his right thigh. He was flown by helicopter to UPMC Hamot, a tertiary-level hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania. The attacker, Hadi Matar, was immediately taken into custody. He was charged with attempted murder and assault, pleading not guilty, and was remanded in custody. By 14 August, Rushdie was off the ventilator and able to talk. Rushdie&#x27;s agent Andrew Wylie reported on 23 October that Rushdie had lost sight in one eye and the use of one hand, but survived the murder attempt.

<text>Prince Antoni Henryk Radziwiłł (; 13 June 1775 – 7 April 1833) was a Polish and Prussian noble, aristocrat, musician, and politician. Initially a hereditary Duke of Nieśwież and Ołyka, as a scion of the Radziwiłł family he also held the honorific title of a &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; of the Holy Roman Empire. Between 1815 and 1831 he acted as &quot;Duke-Governor&quot; (, ) of the Grand Duchy of Posen, an autonomous province of the Kingdom of Prussia created out of Greater Polish lands annexed in the Partitions of Poland.

==Biography==

Antoni Radziwiłł was born on 13 June 1775 in Vilnius to Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and Helena née Przeździecka. From 1792 he attended Göttingen University and was invited to the court of King Frederick William II of Prussia. In 1796 he married Princess Louise of Prussia, the second daughter of Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and hence a niece of the late Prussian king Frederick the Great. His new family convinced him that he should be a mediator between the Poles living under the Third Partition after the failed Kościuszko Uprising and the Prussian authorities in Berlin. Fluctuating between Berlin, Warsaw and Saint Petersburg, Radziwiłł developed the idea of making the province of South Prussia the nucleus of a renewed Polish kingdom, ruled by the Prussian king in personal union.

During Napoleon&#x27;s 1806 campaign in Poland during the War of the Fourth Coalition he tried to incite a Polish uprising against the French army and to convince Prince Józef Poniatowski to abandon his French allies and join the cause of the Russian Empire and Prussia. He failed on both occasions, when Prussia suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Instead Napoleon&#x27;s expedition sparked the Greater Poland Uprising, which led to the establishment of the Duchy of Warsaw under the rule of King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony with Prince Poniatowski as war minister. In the following years Radziwiłł retired to his city palace in Berlin and concentrated on regaining his family&#x27;s vast estates in the Russian partition from the hands of Emperor Alexander I of Russia.

===Duke-Governor===

Upon the Final Act of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, he was sent to the Greater-Poland capital Poznań as Duke-Governor and representative of Prussian King Frederick William III in the Grand Duchy of Posen. Struggling between his Polish subjects and the Prussian authorities, Radziwiłł found himself with little power, as effective power was executed by &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; Joseph Zerboni di Sposetti and the district governors heading the &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; of Posen and Bromberg. His daughter Elisa&#x27;s engagement to Prussian Prince (later German Emperor) William I was broken in 1824.

Shortly after the outbreak of the 1830 November Uprising in Russian Congress Poland led by his brother Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł, he was deprived of all powers, and the rule passed to &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; Eduard Heinrich von Flottwell. Next year the office of Duke-Governor was abolished, and the autonomy of the Grand Duchy was cancelled. It was incorporated into the Provinces of Prussia, renamed the &quot;Province of Posen&quot; in 1848.

Antoni Henryk Radziwiłł returned to his palace in Berlin, where he died on 7 April 1833. He was buried in the Poznań Cathedral. His children with Louise were Germanized and never returned to Poznań; however, as owners of the Nieborów manor near Warsaw and huge family estates in today&#x27;s Belarus, they paid frequent visits to other parts of Poland.

===Patron of the arts===

Antoni Radziwiłł is better known for his art patronage than for his ill-fated political career. His palaces in Berlin (the later Reich Chancellery of Otto von Bismarck), Poznań and Antonin near Ostrów Wielkopolski were known for great concerts performed by one of the most notable musicians of his times. Apart from the guitar, cello and opera concerts performed by Radziwiłł himself, among his guests were Niccolò Paganini (concert in Poznań on 19 May 1829), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Frédéric Chopin and Ludwig van Beethoven. Chopin wrote his &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Polonaise Op. 3&quot; for cello and piano especially for Radziwiłł. He also performed a concert in his palace in Poznań on 2 October 1828. Additionally, Chopin dedicated his Piano Trio Op. 8 to Radziwiłł. Ludwig van Beethoven dedicated his &quot;Ouverture Op. 115&quot; (Zur Namensfeier) to him, while Goethe participated in his efforts to write the music for his &quot;&quot;. Maria Agata Szymanowska dedicated to him the &quot;Serenade pour le Pianoforte avec le accompagnement de violoncelle&quot;. He was also a notable sponsor of Polish theatres and his wife opened the first public school for girls in Poznań in 1830.

<doc id="479961" wikidata="Q1417756" url="?curid=479961" title="Haabʼ">
<text>The Haabʼ () is part of the Maya calendric system. It was a 365-day calendar used by many of the pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica.

==Description==
The Haabʼ comprises eighteen months of twenty days each, plus an additional period of five days (&quot;nameless days&quot;) at the end of the year known as &quot;Wayeb&quot;&#x27; (or &quot;Uayeb&quot; in 16th-century orthography).

Bricker (1982) estimates that the Haabʼ was first used around 500 BCE with a starting point of the winter solstice.

The Haabʼ month names are most commonly referred to by their names in colonial-era Yucatec (Yukatek). In sequence, these (in the revised orthography) are as seen on the right:
Each day in the Haabʼ calendar was identified by a day number within the month followed by the name of the month. Day numbers began with a glyph translated as the &quot;seating of&quot; a named month, which is usually regarded as day 0 of that month, although a minority treat it as day 20 of the month preceding the named month. In the latter case, the seating of Pop is day 5 of Wayebʼ. For the majority, the first day of the year was Seating Pop. This was followed by 1 Pop, 2 Pop ... 19 Pop, Seating Wo, 1 Wo and so on.

Inscriptions on The Temple of the Cross at Palenque shows clearly that the Maya were aware of the true length of the year, even though they did not employ the use of leap days in their system of calculations generally. J. Eric Thompson wrote that the Maya knew of the drift between the Haabʼ and the solar year and that they made &quot;calculations as to the rate at which the error accumulated, but these were merely noted as corrections they were not used to change the calendar.&quot;

===5 unlucky days===
The five nameless days at the end of the calendar, called Wayebʼ, was thought to be a dangerous time. Foster (2002) writes &quot;During Wayeb, portals between the mortal realm and the Underworld dissolved. No boundaries prevented the ill-intending deities from causing disasters.&quot; To ward off these evil spirits, the Mayans had customs and rituals they practised during Wayebʼ. For example, the Mayans would not leave their homes and wash their hair.

<text>Sandvik AB is a Swedish multinational engineering company specializing in products and services for mining, rock excavation, rock drilling, rock processing (crushing and screening), metal cutting and machining. The company was founded in Gävleborg County, Sweden, in 1862. In 2024, it had approximately 41,000 employees and a revenue of 123 billion SEK, with sales in around 150 countries.



==History==

=== 1800s ===
The company was founded by Göran Fredrik Göransson, who was an early user of the Bessemer process. In 1857, he acquired rights to use the patented process and initially applied it in a blast furnace at Edsken, Hofors Municipality. There, he became the first user of the process to achieve technically and commercially acceptable results. However, production at sufficient scale was not possible in the initial location. This prompted the foundation, in 1862, of a new company, &quot;Högbo Stål &amp; Jernverks AB&quot;, in a place that developed into the town of Sandviken.

Already in the 1860s, the company was exporting its products. The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Russia were important markets. In 1868, the company was reorganized as &quot;Sandvikens Jernverks AB&quot; (the Sandviken Ironworks). The &quot;Sandvik&quot; brand name was first used by the company at the Centennial International Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. The following year, sales to the United States began.

In 1889, the company became the first Swedish manufacturer of seamless rolled tubes, and over the following decade, it made substantial investments in methodology development and production facilities for seamless tubes.

=== 1900–1980 ===
Sandvikens Jernverk was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1901.

In 1907, production of hollow rock drill steels began, and by the 1920s, the company was considered internationally leading in that product area.

In 1914, the company established its first sales subsidiary outside of Sweden, in Birmingham, UK. Further foreign subsidiaries were opened 1919 in the United States, 1923 in France, and 1926 in Canada.

In the 1920s, the company began melting stainless steel, and in 1924, it started producing its first stainless seamless tubes. In 1932, it acquired a license to use a new method for cold-rolling tubes, called , and in 1934, it became the first European company to use the method at industrial scale.

In 1937, there were subsidiaries in 37 countries.

World War II forced the company to reorganize production. Exports were halved, but demand from the Swedish military for grenades prevented a corporate crisis.

Already before the war, the company had wanted to enter the cemented carbide tool market, but the patent situation was complicated, and it was unable to find a suitable business partner. However, in 1942, it entered into an agreement with the &quot;Lumalampan&quot; subsidiary of Kooperativa Förbundet. Lumalampan mainly produced tungsten light bulbs but also made tungsten carbide tips for grenades, as well as its own carbide tools for filament wire drawing, and thus possessed the required technology. In the same year, the &quot;Sandvik Coromant&quot; brand was registered for cemented carbide products, and the company started working on tools for metal cutting and rock drilling. Metal cutting tools were successfully produced beginning in 1943, but it took several more years to develop sufficiently durable rock drilling tools.

Bessemer steel production was discontinued in Sandviken in 1947. In the same year, the company became the exclusive supplier of cemented carbide rock drill steels to &quot;Atlas Diesel&quot; (later known as Atlas Copco).

In the 1950s, the company expanded its cemented carbide production capacity by building factories in new locations. A workshop that was opened in the small town of Gimo in 1951 gradually expanded into a major production facility, and in 1953, a factory was opened in the Västberga district of Stockholm. By then, rock drills had emerged as the most important cemented carbide product area for the company.

In 1967, Sandvikens Jernverk had 40 subsidiaries and sales in 100 countries. The company changed its name to &quot;Sandvik AB&quot; in 1972.

In 1979, Sandvik acquired the British company &quot;Osprey&quot;.

Steel conveyor belts of various types had been part of the product range since 1902, and in 1980, a conveyor-belt-based system called &quot;Rotoform&quot; for granulation of liquid chemicals was developed.

=== 1980–2000 ===
In 1980, profits began to fall, and over the following years, there were personnel reductions, restructuring efforts and divestments. Still, in 1983, the company recorded its first loss in 62 years. In 1984, the organization was made more decentralized.

In 1989, Sandvik began investing in Eastern Europe.

In 1994, production at industrial scale of diamond-coated carbide cutting inserts began. In 1996, a new stainless steel called &quot;Safurex&quot; was developed.

In 1997, Sandvik acquired a majority of the Swedish company &quot;Kanthal AB&quot;, which specialized in metallic electrical resistance products and high-temperature ceramic materials. Also, in the same year, Sandvik bought all remaining shares in the Finnish company &quot;Tamrock&quot;, a manufacturer of mining equipment in which it previously had a minority holding.

In 1999, Sandvik divested its production of saws and other craft tools.

=== 2000 to present ===
In 2001, Sandvik started testing a new system named &quot;Automine&quot; for automation and remote control of mining equipment in mines in Canada and Sweden.

In 2002, Sandvik acquired a majority position in the German cutting tool manufacturer &quot;Walter AG&quot;.

In 2004, the Kanthal division developed new alloy production methods with high-temperature powder metallurgy.

In 2009, Sandvik bought the Austrian company &quot;Wolfram Bergbau&quot;, which was focused on tungsten production, from mining to cemented-carbide powder.

In 2017, Sandvik divested its &quot;Process Systems&quot; and &quot;Mining Systems&quot; operations, both of which were related to conveyor technology.

In 2022, Sandvik bought the Australian mine planning software provider &quot;Deswik&quot;.

In August 2022, the business area &quot;Sandvik materials technology&quot;, which included tubes, strip steel, medical wires and Kanthal-brand heating technology products, was spun off as a separate company, publicly listed at Nasdaq Stockholm. The new company was named &quot;Alleima&quot;, and its shares were distributed to the shareholders of Sandvik.

In August 2023, Sandvik announced it had acquired the Cambridge, Ontario-headquartered software development company, Postability.

In September 2023, Sandvik adopted a revised visual identity, with a new logotype that contains different graphical elements than the previous one.

== Operations ==

Sandvik divides its operations into three business areas, &quot;Mining and rock solutions&quot;, accounting for 51 percent of revenues in 2024, &quot;Rock processing solutions&quot;, accounting for 9 percent, and &quot;Manufacturing and machining solutions&quot;, accounting for 40 percent.

=== Mining and rock solutions ===

The mining and rock solutions business area provides vehicles for loading and hauling minerals, equipment for drilling, cutting and other rock excavation tasks, as well as supporting services and infrastructure like digital monitoring and automation systems.

Sandvik is notable for developing battery-powered, remotely monitored and automated equipment. The vehicle TH665B, with a capacity of 65 metric tons, was the highest-capacity battery-electric underground mining truck in the world when it was launched in 2022. Besides the advantage of not producing any diesel exhaust gases, battery-powered trucks emit less heat than diesel-powered trucks, which is beneficial in underground mines, and tend to achieve higher uphill top speeds. Sandvik has developed systems for swapping battery packs of mining trucks and loaders to freshly charged ones, instead of charging the batteries while attached to the vehicle. The minimum time required for battery swapping is a few minutes. Rio Tinto, LKAB, Boliden, Torex Gold, Foran Mining, Rana Gruber and Byrnecut are examples of mining companies that have been reported to use battery-electric Sandvik trucks and loaders.

As of 2024, Sandvik operates a working prototype of a fully automatic battery-powered autonomous drill rig in its test mine in Finland. The machine is capable of planning the drill procedure, optimizing its electric power usage, changing drill bits and automatically returning to a charging station when necessary. In addition to the potential for higher productivity, workplace safety is an area where this kind of technology may bring significant improvements.

=== Rock processing solutions ===

The rock processing solutions business area produces mobile and stationary crushing and screening equipment for rock and mineral processing as well as related tools and services.

=== Manufacturing and machining solutions ===

The manufacturing and machining solutions business area produces tools, software and other equipment for metal cutting, additive manufacturing and metrology. Machining tools are sold under several brand names, for example Sandvik Coromant and Dormer Pramet.

In 2023, Sandvik used equipment and software for precision machining and metrology to produce an AI-designed statue simultaneously inspired by the styles of the artists Michelangelo, Auguste Rodin, Käthe Kollwitz, Kōtarō Takamura and Augusta Savage. The statue is made of stainless steel, weighs 500 kg, is 1.5 meters tall and is manufactured to a precision of 0.03 mm. It was exhibited at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology.

<doc id="479968" wikidata="Q374081" url="?curid=479968" title="Subtractive color">
<text>Subtractive color or subtractive color mixing predicts the spectral power distribution of light after it passes through successive layers of partially absorbing media. This idealized model is the essential principle of how dyes and pigments are used in color printing and photography, where the perception of color is elicited after white light passes through microscopic &quot;stacks&quot; of partially absorbing media allowing some wavelengths of light to reach the eye and not others, and also in painting, whether the colors are mixed or applied in successive layers.

== Process ==
The subtractive color mixing model predicts the resultant spectral power distribution of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials on a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through, resulting in a colored appearance. The resultant spectral power distribution is predicted by sequentially taking the product of the spectral power distributions of the incoming light and transmissivity at each filter.

== Painting ==
The subtractive model also predicts the color resulting from a mixture of paints, or similar medium such as fabric dye, whether applied in layers or mixed together prior to application. In the case of paint mixed before application, incident light interacts with many different pigment particles at various depths inside the paint layer before emerging. Art supply manufacturers offer colors that successfully fill the roles of the subtractive primary colors magenta and cyan. For example, the phthalocyanine blues, which became available during the 1930s, and quinacridone magenta, first offered during the 1950s, together with yellow produce more highly-saturated violets and greens than do the traditional red and blue.

== RYB ==

RYB (red, yellow, blue) is the traditional set of primary colors used for mixing pigments. It is used in art and art education, particularly in painting. It predated modern scientific color theory.

Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors of the RYB color &quot;wheel&quot;. The secondary colors, violet (or purple), orange, and green (VOG) make up another triad, conceptually formed by mixing equal amounts of red and blue, red and yellow, and blue and yellow, respectively.

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th-century theories of color vision as the fundamental sensory qualities blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular, the contrast between &quot;complementary&quot; or opposing hues produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the &quot;Theory of Colours&quot; (1810) by the German poet and government minister Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and &quot;The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast&quot; (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul.

In late 19th and early to mid-20th-century commercial printing, use of the traditional RYB terminology persisted even though the more versatile CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) triad had been adopted, with the cyan sometimes referred to as &quot;process blue&quot; and the magenta as &quot;process red&quot;.

== CMY and CMYK color models and printing processes ==

In color printing, the usual primary colors are cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY). Cyan is the complement of red, meaning that the cyan serves as a filter that absorbs red. The amount of cyan ink applied to a white sheet of paper controls how much of the red light in white light will be reflected back from the paper. Ideally, the cyan ink is completely transparent to green and blue light and has no effect on those parts of the spectrum. Magenta is the complement of green, and yellow the complement of blue. Combinations of different amounts of the three inks can produce a wide range of colors with good saturation.

In inkjet color printing and typical mass production photomechanical printing processes, a black ink K (Key) component is included, resulting in the CMYK color model. The black ink serves to cover unwanted tints in dark areas of the printed image, which result from the imperfect transparency of commercially practical CMY inks; to improve image sharpness, which tends to be degraded by imperfect registration of the three color elements; and to reduce or eliminate consumption of the more expensive color inks where only black or gray is required.

Purely photographic color processes almost never include a K component, because in all common processes the CMY dyes used are much more perfectly transparent, there are no registration errors to camouflage, and substituting a black dye for a saturated CMY combination, a trivial prospective cost-benefit at best, is technologically impractical in non-electronic analog photography.

<doc id="479970" wikidata="Q490939" url="?curid=479970" title="Tzolkʼin">
<text>The tzolkʼin (, formerly and commonly tzolkin) is the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar used by the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

The tzolkʼin, the basic cycle of the Maya calendar, is a preeminent component in the society and rituals of the ancient and the modern Maya. The tzolkʼin is still used by several Maya communities in the Guatemalan highlands. While its use has been spreading in this region, this practice is opposed by Evangelical Christian converts in some Maya communities.

The word &quot;tzolkʼin&quot;, meaning &quot;division of days&quot;, is a western coinage in Yucatec Maya. Contemporary Maya groups who have maintained an unbroken count for over 500 years in the tzolk&#x27;in use other terms in their languages. For instance, the Kʼicheʼ use the term &quot;Aj Ilabal Qʼij&quot; [aχ ilaɓal qʼiχ] or &quot;Raj Ilabal Qʼij&quot; [ɾaχ ilaɓal qʼiχ], &#x27;the sense of the day&#x27; or &#x27;the round of the days&#x27; and the Kaqchikel use the term &quot;Chol Qʼij&quot; [t͡ʃol qʼiχ], &#x27;the organization of time&#x27;. The names of this calendar among the pre-Columbian Maya are not widely known. The corresponding Postclassic Aztec calendar was called &quot;tonalpohualli&quot; in the Nahuatl language.

==The twenty day names==
The tzolkʼin calendar combines a cycle of twenty named days with another cycle of thirteen numbers (the &quot;trecena&quot;), to produce 260 unique days (20 × 13 = 260). Each successive named day is numbered from 1 to 13, and then starting again at 1.

The 20 individual named days are the following:

The tzolkʼin does not have a generally recognized start and end, although there are specific references in the books of &quot;Chilam Balam&quot; to 1 Imix as the beginning day.

Each of the twenty days has its specific primary association connected to the day name&#x27;s meaning.

*Imix : &#x27;Crocodile&#x27; – the reptilian body of the planet earth, or world
*Ik : &#x27;Wind&#x27; – breath, life. Also violence.
*Akbal : &#x27;Night-house&#x27; – darkness, the underworld, realm of the nocturnal jaguar-sun.
*Kan : &#x27;Maize&#x27; – sign of the young maize lord who brings abundance, ripeness. Also lizard, net.
*Chicchan : &#x27;Snake&#x27; – the celestial serpent
*Cimi : &#x27;Death&#x27;
*Manik : &#x27;Deer&#x27; – sign of the Lord of the Hunt
*Lamat : &#x27;Rabbit&#x27; – sign of what is also known as the planet Venus, sunset. The glyph may depict four grains of maize. Invoked by the feminine name &quot;Ixqʼanil&quot; by Xquic.
*Muluc : &#x27;Water&#x27; – symbolised by jade, an aspect of the water deities; fish. Invoked by the feminine name &quot;Ixtoj&quot; by Xquic.
*Oc : &#x27;Dog&#x27; – who guides the night sun through the underworld.
*Chuen : &#x27;Monkey&#x27; – the great craftsman, patron of arts and knowledge. Also thread.
*Eb : &#x27;Grass&#x27; or &#x27;Point&#x27; – associated with rain and storms.
*Ben : &#x27;Reed&#x27; – who fosters the growth of corn, cane, and man.
*Ix : &#x27;Jaguar&#x27; – the night sun. Also maize. Associated with the goddess Ixchel.
*Men : &#x27;Eagle&#x27; – the wise one, bird, moon
*Cib : &#x27;Owl/Vulture&#x27; – death-birds of night and day. Also wax, soul, insect.
*Caban : &#x27;Earthquake&#x27; – formidable power. Also season, thought.
*Etzʼnab : &#x27;Knife&#x27; – the obsidian sacrificial blade.
*Cauac : &#x27;Rain&#x27; or &#x27;Storm&#x27; – the celestial dragon serpents and the &quot;chacs,&quot; gods of thunder and lightning.
*Ahau : &#x27;Lord&#x27; – the radiant sun god. Also associated with the Mayan hero twins.

The variant names and associations below are common to three post-conquest Guatemalan highland calendars. Their interpretations are based primarily on an 1854 manuscript by Hernandez Spina.

*Imox is a bad day, associated with the insane, on which the priests of the sun pray that harm may come to their enemies through evil spirits.
*Iq is a bad day, symbolic in the same way of the destructive forces of nature; that power is localized in stone idols, who are honored with incense, roses, candles, pine needles, and aguardiente. Tumours and painful swellings are attributed to the influence of this day.
*Aqabal is a bad day, on which the priests of the sun go to shrines to pray against their enemies. The day is symbolic of evil in general and of slanderers, in particular. 
*Kat is a bad day in the same sense as Aqabal, symbolic of evil in general.
*Kan is a bad day. It brings sickness and is symbolic of the arbitrary cruelty of nature.
*Kame is recorded as a bad day by one 19th-century source and as a good day by one 20th-century source, Ruth Leah Bunzel. It is symbolic of the ultimate dissolution by death of everything good and everything evil. It is a good day to confess one&#x27;s evil deeds, and ask for pardon.
*Keej is a good day on which wishes are made. It is a good day to ask favors and to commemorate ancestors.
*Qanil is a good day, sacred to fertility gods, associated with human nourishment, the growth of crops, the cycle of death and rebirth, and of the milpa. After the harvest is completed, thanksgiving is made on Qanil.
*Toj is a bad day, symbolized by sickness, and anyone born on it will be perverse. It is a good day to wish sickness upon an enemy.
*Tzi is a bad day, symbolized by sexual depravity. No ceremonies must ever be held on this day.
*Batz is a bad day, symbolized by paralysis. According to some, it is a good day, symbolic of the ancestors.
*E is a good day, symbolized by destiny, fortune, and the essential characteristics of one&#x27;s personality. It is a day on which marriages may be held, and sacrifices to benign deities may be made.
*Aj is a good day, consecrated to fertility gods, herdsmen, and domesticated animals. The day is symbolic of one&#x27;s destiny as embodied in one&#x27;s nagual.
*Ix is a good day, sacred to the mountain and forest spirits. On this day, protection may be sought from wolves and wild predators, in favor of flocks and animals. The day is symbolic of the creative force in general, and of the earth itself. 
*Tzikin is the most excellent day of all. Double offerings are made at shrines, in forests, and in caves. It is a day on which wishes may be made, forgiveness may be sought, and important matters may be finalized.
*Ajmaq is also a very good day, one sacred to the spirits that preside over good health. 
*Noj is an auspicious day, on which good judgement may be prayed for. The day is symbolic both of humanity&#x27;s amoral and moral qualities.

*Kawoq is recognized as an indifferent day or a bad day. It is symbolic of the malice of the dead.
*Junapu or Ajpu is an indifferent day, neither a bad or good portent, on which the power of the ancestors is embodied by the house itself.

==Uses==

The tzolkʼin was extensively used in Mayan inscriptions and codices. Symbolism related to the tzolkʼin is also observed in the Popol Vuh (which, though written in the early post-conquest period, is probably based on older texts). For instance, when Xmucane has set an impossible task for Xquic of collecting a netful of corn from one stalk and Xquic successfully completes it, she leaves the imprint of her net in the ground, and the day &quot;net&quot; is the opening of the Venus cycle which follows &quot;ahau&quot; (&quot;ajpu&quot; in Kʼicheʼ), just as her child is the heir of Hun Hunajpu.

The uses to which the ancient Maya applied the calendar are unknown, nonetheless modern Maya communities employ the calendar as follows:
* For Maize cultivation.(The zenith transit days may have been significant for agriculture along the south coast of Guatemala because April 30 occurs just before the rainy season. Modern Maya plant their corn at the end of April or early in May. In the August 13 zenith transit the Maya initiate its current era in this day&#x27;, approximating the harvest of the dried corn.
* For modern Guatemalan highlanders, the 260 days are employed in training the Aj Kʼij, or &#x27;calendar diviner&#x27;. Nine months after commencing training in divination, the novice is &quot;reborn&quot; and initiated into office. The tzolkʼin is explainable, in principle, as a calendar of midwives, since it counts 260 days from the 20 day period of the conception, from when the heart of the fetus starts to beat, until birth.
* For rituals performed every 260 days. Most famous of these is the &quot;Initiation&quot; celebration of 8 Chuwen, &quot;Waxakibʼ Bʼatz&quot;, in the Kʼiche town of Santa Cruz del Quiche.
* For days which are suitable for certain actions. For instance, a low-numbered Akʼabʼal or Bʼen would be a good day for a wedding, whereas Kʼan would be a good day for building or maintaining a house.
* For divination based on casting lots and counting forward through the calendar from the current &#x27;year bearer&#x27; to arrive at a day which is then interpreted. This is not pure cleromancy because somatic twitches of &quot;blood lightning&quot; can either be specifically consulted or arise spontaneously during the process.
* For traditional Mayan names, which are based on calendar days, often birthdays.
* Somewhat analogous to astrology, personal characteristics are believed to be influenced by the name of the day on which a person was born, and the success of some particular types of endeavor depend on carrying them out on a day whose name is auspicious for those actions.

==Origins==
The 260-day calendar spread throughout the Mesoamerican cultural region and is regarded as the oldest and most important of the calendar systems, with an origin predating its first appearances in Maya inscriptions. The earliest evidence of this calendar comes from a possible day sign with a dot numeral coefficient in an Olmec-like inscription in Oxtotitlán cave dated to 800-500 BCE. Some of the next oldest calendric inscriptions are from early strata of Zapotec in the Oaxacan highlands at sites such as Monte Albán, dating from mid-1st millennium BCE. A few earlier-dated inscriptions and artifacts have what appear to be calendric glyphs, such as at San José Mogote and in the Olmec Gulf Coast region. However, either the dating method or the calendric nature of the glyphs are disputed by scholars. The earliest unequivocal written record is a 7 Deer day sign found in mural paintings at the central lowland Maya site of San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated to the 3rd century BCE, but it is now obvious that the origin of the 260-day is much earlier. An archaeoastronomical study has shown that a number of architectural complexes built in the late second and early first millennia BCE in the area along the southern Gulf coast in Mexico are oriented to the Sun&#x27;s positions on the horizon on certain dates, separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days. Since these were elementary periods of the 260-day cycle, the orientations marking these intervals can only be explained in association with this calendar. The dating of the earliest constructions indicates that it was in use by 1100 BCE.

The original purpose of such a calendar, with no obvious relation to any astronomical or geophysical cycle, is not securely known, but there are several theories. One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya, (Thompson 1950: Maya Hieroglyphic Writing:Introduction). The number twenty was the basis of the Maya counting system, taken from the total number of human digits. (See Maya numerals). Thirteen symbolized the number of levels in the Upperworld where the gods lived, and is also cited by modern daykeepers as the number of &quot;joints&quot; in the human body (ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and neck). The numbers multiplied together equal 260.

Barbara Tedlock studied this system in the contemporary Kʼiche Maya community of the municipality of Momostenango in highland Guatemala. She underwent a formal apprenticeship in calendar divination with a local adept, and was initiated as a diviner in 1976. She says: &quot;The Momostecan calendar embraces both the 260-day cycle and the 365-day solar year, with the four Classic Maya Year-bearers, or Mam, systematically linking the two. The 260-day cycle is conceived as linked firmly to worldly or earthly affairs, mirroring no astronomical period but rather the period of human gestation. Past ethnographic accounts of this cycle contain various conflicting opinions as to what its first day is, but a comparison of the present results and those of previous studies indicates that there is no fixed first day.&quot;

Anthony Aveni asserts, &quot;Once a Maya genius may have recognized that somewhere deep within the calendar system lay the miraculous union, the magical crossing point of a host of time cycles: 9 moons, 13 times 20, a birth cycle, a planting cycle, a Venus cycle, a sun cycle, an eclipse cycle. The number 260 was tailor made for the Maya&quot;. Others have observed that the &quot;Venus Table&quot; in the Dresden Codex, is an accurate ephemeris for predicting Venus positions. Others have also observed a basis for the 260-day cycle in the agricultural cycle of highland Guatemala, which is also about 260 days. Aveni notes that &quot;the average duration between successive halves of the eclipse season, at 173 ½ days, fits into the tzolkin in the ratio of 3 to 2.&quot; This may seem contrived, but the Maya did employ the tzolkin to predict positions of Venus and eclipses.

Another theory is that the 260-day period is the length of human pregnancy. This is close to the average number of days between the &quot;first missed&quot; menstrual period and birth, unlike Naegele&#x27;s rule which is 40 weeks (280 days) between the &quot;last&quot; menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that midwives originally developed the calendar to predict babies&#x27; expected birth dates.

Vincent Malmström identifies a correlation between the 260-day cycle and the 260-day gap between zenithal passages of the sun. According to this hypothesis, the 260-day cycle originated in the narrow latitudinal band (14°42′N to 15°N) in which the sun is vertically overhead about 12–13 August and again 260 days later about 30 April – 1 May (Malmström identifies the proto-Classic Izapan culture as one suitable candidate at this latitude). This period may have been used for the planting schedule of maize. However, others object to this conception, noting that while the 260-day calendar runs continuously the interval between autumn-spring and spring-autumn positions alternates between 260 and 105 days, and that the earliest-known calendric inscriptions are from considerably farther north of this zone. Consequently, this theory is not widely supported.

It is also possible that the number 260 has multiple sources.

==The tzolkʼin and the New Age movement==
The tzolkʼin is the basis for the modern, New Age invention of the &quot;Dreamspell&quot; calendar, developed by the esoteric author José Argüelles. The Dreamspell calendar is sometimes mistakenly identified as an authentic interpretation or extension of the original Maya calendar, although Argüelles himself acknowledges the Dreamspell calendar is a new and syncretic creation, inspired by elements from Mesoamerican and non-Mesoamerican sources.

In 1987, before the Harmonic Convergence, inspired by a single paragraph of Argüelles&#x27;s book &quot;The Mayan Factor&quot; (wherein he refers to each day as a &quot;tone&quot;), singer/songwriter and sound healer, Alyras (aka Mirai), translated the tzolkʼin&#x27;s harmonic values into sound, with the tutelage of Barbara Hero. Eschewing extensions of the tzolkʼin, Alyras opted for strict mathematical adherence to the tzolkʼin&#x27;s fundamental structure and sequences, in order to present a truly authentic sonic expression of its inner workings.

In 1995, Maria von Boisse translated the mathematical matrix of the tzolkʼin to musical notes and set them into music. The final version of the work was developed in collaboration with Hubert Bognermayr in the &quot;Electronic Försterhaus&quot; in Linz, Austria.

In 1998, composer Michael John Wiley discovered mathematical and aesthetic correlations between the tzolk&#x27;in vigesimal count and the naturally occurring overtone series found in music, yielding the composition Tzolkin in C Major&quot;, which was premiered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra in Japan, 2002, taking 3rd Prize at the prestigious Toru Takemitsu Composition Award, and subsequently developed into a Tzolkin Cultural Meditation, an audio/visual presentation of the 260 day calendar and timing matrix.

<text>The Janata Party (JP, ) is an unrecognised political party in India. Navneet Chaturvedi is the current president of the party since November 2021, replacing Jaiprakash Bandhu.

The JP was established as an amalgam of Indian political parties opposed to the Emergency that was imposed between 1975 and 1977 by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of the Indian National Congress (R). They included the conservative Indian National Congress (Organisation), the hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the liberal to social-democratic Bharatiya Lok Dal (formed in 1974 by the merger of the conservative-liberal Swatantra Party, the conservative Bharatiya Kranti Dal, the Samyukta Socialist Party and the Utkal Congress) and the Socialist Party, as well as later defectors from the Indian National Congress.

Raj Narain, a Socialist, had filed a legal writ alleging electoral malpractice against Indira Gandhi in 1971. On 12 June 1975, Allahabad High Court found her guilty of using corrupt electoral practices in her 1971 election victory over Narain in the Rae Bareli constituency. She was barred from contesting any election for the next six years. Economic problems, corruption and the conviction of Gandhi led to widespread protests against the government, which responded by imposing a State of Emergency. The rationale was that of preserving national security. However, the government introduced press censorship, postponed elections and banned strikes and rallies. Opposition leaders such as Narain, J. B. Kripalani, Jayaprakash Narayan, Anantram Jaiswal, Chandra Shekhar, Biju Patnaik, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L. K. Advani, Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Ramnandan Mishra and Morarji Desai were imprisoned, along with thousands of other political activists. When the Emergency was lifted and a new election called in 1977, opposition leaders joined to form the JP. In the 1977 general election, the party defeated the Congress (R) and JP leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister in independent modern India&#x27;s history. Narain defeated Gandhi at Rae Bareli in that election. The new JP-led government reversed many Emergency-era decrees and opened official investigations into Emergency-era abuses. Although several major foreign policy and economic reforms were attempted, continuous in-fighting and ideological differences made the Janata government unable to effectively address national problems. In July 1979 Desai was forced to resign and was replaced by Charan Singh. Popular disenchantment with the political infighting and ineffective government led to the resurgence of Gandhi and her new Indian National Congress (I) party.

JP&#x27;s success was short-lived and, in the 1980 general election, the Congress (I) was returned to power. JP&#x27;s heterogeneous nature led to its fragmentation. The first major split occurred in July 1979 when Narain formed his own social-democratic Janata Party (Secular). Shortly after the 1980 election, Hindu nationalists regrouped in the Bharatiya Janata Party, meant as a successor to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. In 1980 the Janata Party (Secular) was merged into the Lokdal, which would finally merge into the larger Janata Dal, which led the government in 1989–1991 and later experienced a fragmentation similar to JP&#x27;s. Direct or indirect spliter parties of the Janata Dal, some of which regional, have included the socialist Samata Party, the Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) or Janata Dal (Socialist), the Janata Dal (United), the Janata Dal (Secular), the socialist Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Biju Janata Dal and the Rashtriya Lok Dal.

== History ==
Having led the Indian independence movement, the Indian National Congress became the most popular political party in independent India and won every election following national independence in 1947. However, the Indian National Congress bifurcated in 1969 over the issue of the leadership of Indira Gandhi, the daughter of India&#x27;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Supporters of Indira Gandhi claimed to be the real Congress party, adopting the name Indian National Congress (R) – where &quot;R&quot; stood for &quot;Requisition.&quot; Congress politicians who opposed Indira identified themselves as the Indian National Congress (O) – where &quot;O&quot; stood for &quot;Organisation&quot; or &quot;Old.&quot; For the 1971 election, the Congress (O), Samyukta Socialist Party and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh had formed a coalition called the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; to oppose Indira Gandhi and the Congress (R), but failed to have an impact; Indira&#x27;s Congress (R) won a large majority in the 1971 elections and her popularity increased significantly after India&#x27;s victory in the war of 1971 against Pakistan.

However Indira&#x27;s subsequent inability to address serious issues such as unemployment, poverty, inflation and shortages eroded her popularity. The frequent invoking of &quot;President&#x27;s rule&quot; to dismiss state governments led by opposition political parties was seen as authoritarian and opportunist. Political leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya Kripalani and Congress (O) chief Morarji Desai condemned Indira&#x27;s government as dictatorial and corrupt. Narayan and Desai founded the Janata Morcha (&quot;People&#x27;s Front&quot;), the predecessor of what would become the Janata party. The Janata Morcha won the elections for the Vidhan Sabha (State Legislature) of the state of Gujarat on 11 June 1975.

Raj Narain, a leader of the Socialist Party (India), who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of Rae Bareilly in 1971, lodged a case at the Allahabad High Court, alleging electoral malpractices and the use of government resources for her election campaign. On 12 June 1975 in &quot;State of Uttar Pradesh v. Raj Narain&quot;, the Allahabad High Court found Indira guilty and barred her from holding public office for six years. Opposition politicians immediately demanded her resignation and stepped up mass protests against the government. On 25 June, Narayan and Desai held a massive rally in Delhi, calling for a &quot;Satyagraha&quot; – a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience to force the government to resign.

== Emergency ==

On 25 June 1975, the president of India, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, accepted prime minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s recommendation to declare a state of national emergency. Indira argued that the political and civil disorder constituted a threat to national security. A state of emergency enabled the central government to issue executive decrees without requiring the consent of Parliament. Elections were postponed and public gatherings, rallies and strikes were banned. Curfews were imposed and police forces were empowered to make warrantless searches, seizures and arrests. Indira&#x27;s government imposed &quot;President&#x27;s rule&quot; in the states of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, dismissing the governments controlled by opposition political parties. The central government also imposed censorship on radio, television and newspapers. Across the country, police forces arrested thousands of opposition political activists, as well as leaders such as Raj Narain, Jayaprakash Narayan, Jivatram Kripalani,Anantram Jaiswal, Kamaraj, Morarji Desai, Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Vijaya Raje Scindia, Charan Singh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and others. Opposition political organisations such as the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were banned and their leaders arrested. Only the Communist Party of India supported the state of emergency. Due to the advancing age and failing health, Narayan was released from prison, but remained prohibited from political activity.

During the Emergency, Indira Gandhi implemented a 20-point program of economic reforms that resulted in greater economic growth, aided by the absence of strikes and trade union conflicts. Encouraged by these positive signs and distorted and biased information from her party supporters, Indira called elections for May 1977. However, the emergency era had been widely unpopular. The most controversial issue was the 42nd amendment to the Constitution of India, which deprived citizens of direct access to the Supreme Court, except when violation of the fundamental rights resulted from Union law. The Parliament was given unrestrained power to amend any parts of the Constitution. The Supreme Court was given exclusive jurisdiction as regards determination of the constitutional validity of laws passed by the Union government. It restricted the power of the courts to issue stay orders or injunctions. Almost all parts of the Constitution saw changes through this amendment. The clampdown on civil liberties and allegations of widespread abuse of human rights by police had angered the public. Indira Gandhi was believed, by the public at large to be under the influence of a clique of politicians led by her youngest son, Sanjay Gandhi, who had become notorious for using his influence in the government and the Congress party for alleged corrupt activities. Sanjay Gandhi had masterminded the Union government&#x27;s unpopular campaign of family planning, which had allegedly involved forcible sterilisation of young men by government officials. Sanjay Gandhi had also instigated the demolition of slums in the Jama Masjid area of New Delhi, the national capital, which left thousands of people, mostly Muslims, homeless. Indian laborers, urban workers, teachers and government employees were also disenchanted by wage freezes and the curtailing of trade union activities and rights.

== Creation ==
Calling elections on 18 January 1977 the government released political prisoners and weakened restrictions and censorship on the press, although the state of emergency was not officially ended. When opposition leaders sought the support of Jayaprakash Narayan for the forthcoming election, Narayan insisted that all opposition parties form a united front. The Janata Party was officially launched on 23 January 1977 when the Janata Morcha, Charan Singh&#x27;s Bharatiya Lok Dal, Swatantra Party, the Socialist Party of India of Raj Narain and George Fernandes, and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) joined, dissolving their separate identities (the merger of all party organisations was to be completed after the election). Although the political ideologies of Janata constituents were diverse and conflicting, the party was able to unite under the over-reaching appeal of Jayaprakash Narayan, who had been seen as the ideological leader of the anti-Emergency movement and now the Janata party. Chandra Shekhar became first president of Janata Party. Ramakrishna Hegde became the party general secretary, and Bharatiya Jana Sangh politician Lal Krishna Advani became the party spokesperson.

The Janata manifesto was released on 10 February, which declared that the coming election presented voters with:

As it became clear that Indira&#x27;s Emergency rule had been widely unpopular, defections from the Congress (R) government increased. The most significant was that of Jagjivan Ram, who commanded great support amongst India&#x27;s Dalit communities. A former Minister of Defence, Ram left the Congress (R) and along with his supporters formed the Congress for Democracy on 2 February 1977. Other co-founders included the former Chief Minister of Orissa Nandini Satpathy, former Union Minister of State for Finance K. R. Ganesh, former MP D. N. Tiwari and Bihar politician Raj Mangal Pandey.

Although committing to contest the election with the Janata party, Ram resisted merging his party organisation with Janata. It was ultimately decided that the Congress for Democracy would contest the election with the same manifesto as the Janata party and would join the Janata party in Parliament, but would otherwise retain a separate identity (the CFD would merge with the Janata party after the elections on 5 May). On 30 January 1977 the Communist Party of India (Marxist) announced that it would seek to avoid a splintering in the opposition vote by not running candidates against the Janata party.

== 1977 elections ==

During the election campaign, the leaders of the Congress (R) and the Janata party traveled across the country to rally supporters. Indira and her Congress (R) promoted the record of achieving economic development and orderly government. Although she offered apologies for abuses committed during the Emergency, Indira and the Congress (R) defended the rationale of imposing the state of emergency as being essential for national security. On the other hand, Janata leaders assailed Indira for ruling as a dictator and endangering human rights and democracy in India. Janata&#x27;s campaign evoked memories of India&#x27;s freedom struggle against British rule, during which Jayaprakash Narayan, Jivatram Kripalani and Morarji Desai had first emerged as political leaders. Although Narayan and Kripalani did not seek office themselves, they became the leading campaigners for the Janata party, drawing great masses of people in rallies across the country.

Actions taken during Emergency significantly diminished support for the Congress (R) amongst its most loyal constituencies. The bulldozing of slums near the Jama Masjid was widely unpopular amongst India&#x27;s Muslims, and the defection of Jagjivan Ram significantly diminished support for the Congress (R) amongst India&#x27;s Dalits. BLD leader Charan Singh&#x27;s peasant roots helped him raise considerable support in the rural parts of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India. The Shiromani Akali Dal, the party of the Sikhs of Punjab and regional political parties such as the Tamil Nadu-based Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam became important allies. The leaders of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh rallied India&#x27;s middle-class merchants, traders and conservative Hindus. The Hindu nationalist RSS and trade unions aligned with Janata helped rally considerable voting blocs.

The 1977 election drew a turnout of 60% from an electorate of more than 320 million. On 23 March, it was announced that the Janata party had won a sweeping victory, securing 43.2% of the popular vote and 271 seats. With the support of the Akali Dal and the Congress for Democracy, it had amassed a two-thirds, or absolute majority of 345 seats. Although the Congress for Democracy won 28 seats, Ram&#x27;s standing as a national Dalit leader and moving a significant share of the Dalit vote to the Janata party and its allies won him considerable influence.

In contrast to the rest of the country, the Janata party won only six seats from India&#x27;s southern states – none from the state of Kerala – where the Emergency had not caused political unrest. The Congress (R) won a total of 153 seats, mainly from India&#x27;s south. However, Janata candidates resoundingly defeated Congress (R) candidates in the northern &quot;Hindi belt&quot;, especially in Uttar Pradesh. One of the most shocking outcomes of the election was the defeat of Indira Gandhi in her bid to seek re-election from her constituency of Rae Bareilly, which she lost to her 1971 opponent Raj Narain by a margin of 55,200 votes. The Congress (R) did not win any seats in Uttar Pradesh and was wiped out in 10 states and territories by Janata candidates.

== Government formation ==

On the morning of 24 March, Jayaprakash Narayan and Jivatram Kripalani led the newly elected Janata MPs to Raj Ghat, where the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were laid, and administered a pledge to continue Gandhi&#x27;s work and preserve honesty in serving the nation. Immediately afterwards, the Janata party faced a serious challenge in choosing a leader to become India&#x27;s new prime minister, where the rival bids of party leaders could divide the party and weaken its majority before it took power. Janata party chairman Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram enjoyed the support of a significant number of Janata MPs and the activists brought from their own political parties into the Janata organisation. To avoid a potentially divisive contest, Janata leaders asked Jayaprakash Narayan and Jivatram Kripalani to select the party&#x27;s leader, pledging to abide by their choice. After a period of deliberation, Narayan and Kripalani selected Morarji Desai to become the chairman of the Janata Parliamentary Party on 24 May. Although some leaders such as George Fernandes and Jagjivan Ram hesitated to support Desai and criticised the undemocratic method of selection, Desai&#x27;s position was soon confirmed and consolidated.

Taking office as prime minister, Desai also took charge of the Ministry of Finance. He sought to carefully distribute important posts to satisfy Janata&#x27;s different constituents and the most powerful party leaders who were rivals for his own position of leadership. Both Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram were accorded the title of deputy prime minister. Charan Singh became the Minister of Home Affairs, the second-most important position in the Council of Ministers, while Jagjivan Ram took charge of the Ministry of Defence. BJS leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani were respectively given charge of the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Raj Narain was appointed Minister of Health, Madhu Dandavate was to head the Ministry of Railways and trade unionist George Fernandes was made the Ministry of Communications. Jurist Shanti Bhushan was appointed Minister of Law and Justice. Congress (O) veteran and Janata candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy won the presidential election to become the 6th President of India on 25 July 1977.

The results of its election defeat considerably weakened and diminished the Congress (R). Significant numbers of Congress (R) MPs and activists condemned Indira&#x27;s leadership and left the party. As a result, MPs still loyal to Indira Gandhi renamed their party to Congress (I) – &quot;I&quot; standing for Indira. Although no longer an MP, Indira Gandhi continued as the president of Congress (I), which remained the largest opposition party.

== Janata rule ==

The first actions taken by the Desai government were to formally end the state of emergency and media censorship and repeal the controversial executive decrees issued during the Emergency. The Constitution was amended to make it more difficult for any future government to declare a state of emergency; fundamental freedoms and the independence of India&#x27;s judiciary was reaffirmed.

The new government also proceeded to withdraw all charges against the 25 accused in the Baroda dynamite case, which included the new Minister of Industry, George Fernandes. The Minister of Railways reinstated the railway employees disciplined after the May 1974 strike. The Desai government proceeded to establish inquiry commissions and tribunals to investigate allegations of corruption and Indira Gandhi&#x27;s government, political party and the police forces. Specific inquiries were instituted on Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s management of the state-owned Maruti Udyog Ltd., the activities of the former Minister of Defence Bansi Lal and the 1971 Nagarwala scandal. Both Indira and her son Sanjay were charged with allegations of corruption and briefly arrested.

=== Elections in the states ===
Immediately upon taking office, the Janata government pressured the ten state governments where the Congress was in power to dissolve the state assemblies and hold fresh elections in June. Tamil Nadu witnessed the massive victory of the AIADMK, led by M. G. Ramachandran. Home Minister Charan Singh argued that the ruling party had been resoundingly rejected by voters and would need to win a new mandate from the people of the states. The Congress (R) was defeated in all the states, and the Janata party took power in seven – Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. In Punjab, the Janata party formed a coalition government with the Akali Dal. In Bihar, Karpuri Thakur won the closely contested Janata legislature party leadership from the then Bihar Janata Party chief Satyendra Narayan Sinha to become the Bihar Chief Minister. The number of Janata members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs) of all the states increased from 386 to 1,246 seats. The government also called fresh elections in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where the Janata party won 13 seats to the Congress&#x27;s 11, and the veteran Kashmiri politician Sheikh Abdullah returned to power after having been dismissed in 1953.

=== Foreign policy ===
Prime Minister Morarji Desai and the Minister of External Affairs Atal Bihari Vajpayee began significant changes in India&#x27;s foreign policy, moving away from the course adopted by Indira&#x27;s government. Both Pakistan and China had celebrated the ouster of Indira Gandhi, who had preserved a hardline stance against India&#x27;s rival neighbors. In 1979, Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the highest-ranking Indian official to visit Beijing, meeting China&#x27;s leaders. The Desai government re-established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which had been severed due to the Sino-Indian War of 1962. Both nations established regular dialogue to resolve long-standing territorial disputes, expand trade and enhance border security. The Desai government ended India&#x27;s support for the guerrillas loyal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh, who had been assassinated in 1975 by military officers and replaced by a military regime that sought to distance itself from India.

India also sought to improve relations with the United States, which had been strained due to the latter&#x27;s support for Pakistan during the 1971 war and India&#x27;s subsequent proximity with the Soviet Union. The Janata government announced its desire to achieve &quot;genuine&quot; non-alignment in the Cold War, which had been the long-standing national policy. In 1978, Jimmy Carter became the third U.S. president to make an official visit to India. Both nations sought to improve trade and expand cooperation in science and technology. Vajpayee represented India at the U.N. conference on nuclear disarmament, defending India&#x27;s nuclear programme and its refusal to sign non-proliferation treaties.

=== Economic policy ===
The Janata government had lesser success in achieving economic reforms. It launched the Sixth Five-Year Plan, aiming to boost agricultural production and rural industries. Seeking to promote economic self-reliance and indigenous industries, the government required multi-national corporations to go into partnership with Indian corporations. The policy proved controversial, diminishing foreign investment and led to the high-profile exit of corporations such as Coca-Cola and IBM from India.

== List of Chief Ministers ==

== Fall of the government ==
Despite a strong start, the Janata government began to wither as significant ideological and political divisions emerged. The party consisted of veteran socialists, trade unionists and pro-business leaders, making major economic reforms difficult to achieve without triggering a public divide. Socialists and secular Janata politicians shared an aversion to the Hindu nationalist agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, whose members included Vajpayee, Advani and other leaders from the former Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Violence between Hindus and Muslims led to further confrontations within the Janata party, with most Janata leaders demanding that Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani choose between staying in government and being members of the RSS. Both Vajpayee and Advani as well as other members of the former BJS opted to remain members of the RSS and consequently resigned from their posts and from the party.

The decline in the popularity of the Janata government was aided by the stalled prosecution of Emergency-era abuses. The government had failed to prove most of the allegations and obtained few convictions. Cases against Indira Gandhi had also stalled for lack of evidence, and her continued prosecution began to evoke sympathy for her from the Indian public and anger of her supporters, who saw it as a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;

In June 1978, Raj Narain attacked party president Chandra Shekhar and Bharatiya Jana Sangh. On 16 June 1978, Charan Singh announced his resignation from Janata Party parliamentary board. Janata Party parliamentary board which met on 22 June 1978 issued show-cause notices to Raj Narain, Devi Lal, Ram Dhan, Jabbar Singh and Sibhan Lal Saxena. On 1 July 1978, Charan Singh resigned from the cabinet of Morarji Desai because of growing differences between them over trial of Indira Gandhi. On 24 January 1979, Charan Singh returned into cabinet and held portfolios of Minister of Finance and becoming Deputy Prime Minister. Hirubhai M. Patel was shifted from Finance ministry to Home Ministry.

Through 1979, support for Morarji Desai had declined considerably due to worsening economic conditions as well as the emergence of allegations of nepotism and corruption involving members of his family. Desai&#x27;s confrontational attitude eroded his support. His main rival Charan Singh had developed an acrimonious relationship with Desai. Protesting Desai&#x27;s leadership, Singh resigned and withdrew the support of his Bharatiya Lok Dal. Desai also lost the support of the secular and socialist politicians in the party, who saw him as favoring the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh. On 19 July 1979 Desai resigned from the government and eventually retired to his home in Mumbai (then Bombay). The failing health of Jayaprakash Narayan made it hard for him to remain politically active and act as a unifying influence, and his death in 1979 deprived the party of its most popular leader. Dissidents projected Charan Singh as the new prime minister in place of Desai.

President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy appointed Charan Singh as the Prime Minister of a minority government on the strength of 64 MPs, calling upon him to form a new government and prove his majority. The departure of Desai and the BJS had considerably diminished Janata&#x27;s majority, and numerous Janata MPs refused to support Charan Singh. MPs loyal to Jagjivan Ram withdrew themselves from the Janata party. Former allies such as the DMK, Shiromani Akali Dal and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had distanced themselves from the Janata party. Desperately seeking enough support for a majority, Charan Singh even sought to negotiate with Congress (I), which refused. After only three weeks in office, Charan Singh resigned. With no other political party in position to establish a majority government, President Reddy dissolved the Parliament and called fresh elections for January 1980.

In 1980 general elections, Janata Party declared Jagjivan Ram as its Prime Ministerial candidate, but the party won only 31 seats out of 542.

== Status ==
In the run-up to the 1980 elections, the remaining Janata party leaders tried unsuccessfully to rebuild the party and make fresh alliances. Desai campaigned for the party but did not himself stand for election, preferring retirement from politics. The Congress (I) capitalised on the aversion of the Indian public to another fragile and dysfunctional government by campaigning on the slogan &quot;Elect A Government That Works!&quot; Indira Gandhi apologised for mistakes made during the Emergency and won the endorsement of respected national leaders such as Vinoba Bhave. At the polls, the candidates running under the Janata ticket were resoundingly defeated – the party lost 172 seats, winning only 31. Indira Gandhi and the Congress (I) returned to power with a strong majority. Sanjay Gandhi was also elected to the Parliament. President Reddy was succeeded at the end of his term in 1982 by Congress (I) leader Zail Singh.(RUPPS).

Between 1980 and 1989, the Janata party maintained a small presence in the Indian Parliament under the leadership of socialist politician Chandra Sekhar. In 1988, Lok Dal (A) was merged into Janata Party and Ajit Singh was made its president. After some months, it merged into the Janata Dal, which had emerged as the chief opposition party under the leadership of Vishwanath Pratap Singh and the main constituent of the National Front coalition. Singh had become widely popular for exposing the role of the government of prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, the eldest son and successor of Indira, in the Bofors scandal, though on 5 February 2004, the Delhi High Court quashed the charges of bribery against Rajiv Gandhi and others.

But some leaders of Janata Party refused to accept its merger into Janata Dal and continued in Janata Party. These included Indubhai Patel, Subramanian Swamy, Syed Shahabuddin, H. D. Deve Gowda, Sarojini Mahishi. On 4 January 1989, Indubhai Patel was declared as acting president of Janata Party. Janata Dal filed an application to Election Commission of India to seek the transfer of Janata Party symbol to its own. But the Election Commission froze the symbol &quot;chakra–haldhar&quot; for 1989 general election and as a result, Janata Dal had to use &quot;wheel&quot; as their election symbol. Janata Party continue to retain its status as unrecognised registered party with Election Commission of India and retains its symbol of &quot;chakra-haldhar.&quot;
Since the original Janata Party disappeared when it merged into the Janata Dal, these two(the 1977 one and present one) are considered as distinct from one another by many.
&lt;br&gt;
Under V. P. Singh, the Janata Dal and the National Front sought to replicate the Janata-style alliance of anti-Congress political parties. Although it failed to win a majority, it managed to form a fragile coalition government with V.P. Singh as the prime minister with the outside support of the BJP and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). However, Singh&#x27;s government soon fell victim to intra-party rivalries and power struggles, and his successor Chandra Sekhar&#x27;s Janata Dal (Socialist) government lasted barely into 1991.

== Legacy ==
Although its tenure in office was tumultuous and unsuccessful, the Janata party played a definitive role in Indian politics and history and its legacy remains strong in contemporary India. The Janata party led a popular movement to restore civil liberties, evoking the memories and principles of the Indian independence movement. Its success in ending 30 years of uninterrupted Congress rule helped strengthen India&#x27;s multi-party democracy. The term &quot;Janata&quot; has been used by several major political parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal and others.

Participants in the struggle against the Indian Emergency (1975–77) and of the Janata party went on to comprise a new generation of Indian political leaders. Chandra Shekhar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deve Gowda went on to serve as Prime Ministers; Vajpayee led the first non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term from 1999 to 2004. Lal Krishna Advani served as deputy prime minister. Younger politicians such as Subramanian Swamy, Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj and others were grass-roots activists in the Janata party.

The Janata Party continued to exist led by Subramanian Swamy, which maintained a small presence in the politics of the state of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Delhi and at the national stage. Janata party continued its lead as opposition in AP until the formation of TDP party.

<text>An attribute grammar is a formal way to supplement a formal grammar with semantic information processing. Semantic information is stored in attributes associated with terminal and nonterminal symbols of the grammar. The values of attributes are the result of attribute evaluation rules associated with productions of the grammar. Attributes allow the transfer of information from anywhere in the abstract syntax tree to anywhere else, in a controlled and formal way.

Each semantic function deals with attributes of symbols occurring only in one production rule: both semantic function parameters and its result are attributes of symbols from one particular rule. When a semantic function defines the value of an attribute of the symbol on the left hand side of the rule, the attribute is called &quot;synthesized&quot;; otherwise it is called &quot;inherited&quot;. Thus, synthesized attributes serve to pass semantic information up the parse tree, while inherited attributes allow values to be passed from the parent nodes down and across the syntax tree.

In simple applications, such as evaluation of arithmetic expressions, attribute grammar may be used to describe the entire task to be performed besides parsing in straightforward way; in complicated systems, for instance, when constructing a language translation tool, such as a compiler, it may be used to validate semantic checks associated with a grammar, representing the rules of a language not explicitly imparted by the syntax definition. It may be also used by parsers or compilers to translate the syntax tree directly into code for some specific machine, or into some intermediate language.

==History==
Attribute grammars were invented by Donald Knuth and Peter Wegner. While Donald Knuth is credited for the overall concept, Peter Wegner invented inherited attributes during a conversation with Knuth. Some embryonic ideas trace back to the work of Edgar T. &quot;Ned&quot; Irons, the author of IMP.

==Example==
The following is a simple context-free grammar which can describe a language made up of multiplication and addition of integers.

 Expr → Expr + Term
 Expr → Term
 Term → Term * Factor
 Term → Factor
 Factor → &quot;(&quot; Expr &quot;)&quot;
 Factor → &quot;integer&quot;

The following attribute grammar can be used to calculate the result of an expression written in the grammar. Note that this grammar only uses synthesized values, and is therefore an S-attributed grammar.
 Expr1 → Expr2 + Term [ Expr1.value = Expr2.value + Term.value ]
 Expr → Term [ Expr.value = Term.value ]
 Term1 → Term2 * Factor [ Term1.value = Term2.value * Factor.value ]
 Term → Factor [ Term.value = Factor.value ]
 Factor → &quot;(&quot; Expr &quot;)&quot; [ Factor.value = Expr.value ]
 Factor → &quot;integer&quot; [ Factor.value = strToInt(&quot;integer&quot;.str) ]

==Synthesized attributes==
A synthesized attribute is computed from the values of attributes of the children. Since the values of the children must be computed first, this is an example of bottom-up propagation. To formally define a synthesized attribute, let formula_1 be a formal grammar, where

* formula_2 is the set of non terminal symbols
* formula_3 is the set of terminal symbols
* formula_4 is the set of productions
* formula_5 is the distinguished, or start, symbol

Then, given a string of nonterminal symbols formula_6 and an attribute name formula_7, formula_8 is a synthesized attribute if all three of these conditions are met:

* formula_9 (i.e. formula_10 is one of the rules in the grammar)
*formula_11 (i.e. every symbol in the body of the rule is either nonterminal or terminal)
*formula_12, where formula_13 (i.e. the value of the attribute is a function formula_14 applied to some values from the symbols in the body of the rule)

==Inherited attributes==
An &quot;inherited attribute&quot; at a node in parse tree is defined using the attribute values at the parent or siblings. Inherited attributes are convenient for expressing the dependence of a programming language construct on the context in which it appears. For example, we can use an inherited attribute to keep track of whether an identifier appears on the left or the right side of an assignment in order to decide whether the address or the value of the identifier is needed. In contrast to synthesized attributes, inherited attributes can take values from parent and/or siblings. As in the following production,

: S → ABC

where A can get values from S, B, and C. B can take values from S, A, and C. Likewise, C can take values from S, A, and B.

==Special types of attribute grammars==
* L-attributed grammar: &quot;inherited attributes&quot; can be evaluated in one left-to-right traversal of the abstract syntax tree
* LR-attributed grammar: an L-attributed grammar whose &quot;inherited attributes&quot; can also be evaluated in bottom-up parsing.
* ECLR-attributed grammar: a subset of LR-attributed grammars where equivalence classes can be used to optimize the evaluation of inherited attributes.
* S-attributed grammar: a simple type of attribute grammar, using only &quot;synthesized attributes&quot;, but no &quot;inherited attributes&quot;

* Van Wijngaarden grammar

<text>The Arizona Biltmore is a historic resort located in Phoenix, Arizona, near 24th Street and Camelback Road. Designed by Albert Chase McArthur, it opened on February 23, 1929, as part of the Biltmore Hotel chain. Actors Clark Gable and Carole Lombard often stayed there and the Tequila sunrise cocktail was invented there. It is part of LXR Hotels &amp; Resorts.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Warren McArthur, Jr., and brother Charles McArthur along with John McEntee Bowman, the entrepreneur behind the Biltmore Hotel chain, constructed the Arizona Biltmore.

The Arizona Biltmore&#x27;s architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur (brother of the hotel owners), yet the design is often mistakenly attributed to Frank Lloyd Wright. This is due to Wright&#x27;s on-site consulting for four months in 1928 relating to the &quot;Textile Block&quot; construction used in the hotel. Albert McArthur had been a draftsman for Wright, and specifically asked Wright to assist with implementing the textile block system, which became a signature element of the hotel&#x27;s appearance. The hotel has similarities to several Wright buildings, especially in the main lobby, owing to a strong imprint of the unit block design that Wright had utilized on four residential buildings in the Los Angeles area six years earlier. McArthur is indisputably the architect as original linen drawings of the hotel in the Arizona State University Library archives attest, as does a 1929 feature article in &quot;Architectural Record&quot; magazine. The two architects are a study in contrast with the famous and outspoken Wright being self-taught and never licensed as an architect in Arizona. The more soft-spoken McArthur was Harvard-trained in architecture, mathematics, engineering, and music. McArthur obtained an architect&#x27;s license in Arizona, number 338, in 1925, the year he arrived in Phoenix to begin his practice.

Adding to the confusion, Frank Lloyd Wright influences have been added to the property over the years. This includes a stained glass window design entitled &quot;Saguaro Forms and Cactus Flowers&quot; that Wright designed as a magazine cover for &quot;Liberty Magazine&quot; in 1926. It was fabricated by Taliesin students and installed during the 1973 hotel renovations and restoration. Reproductions of the geometric &#x27;sprite&#x27; statues originally designed by Wright and sculpted by Alfonso Iannelli for the 1915 Midway Gardens project in Chicago are placed around the property. Also, the original hotel solarium was converted to a restaurant in 1973 and since the mid-1990s has been named &#x27;Wright&#x27;s&#x27;. Three onsite restaurants bear Wright&#x27;s name: Wright&#x27;s at the Biltmore, The Wright Bar, and Frank &amp; Albert&#x27;s.

Three construction crews worked 24 hours a day to complete the hotel. S. M. Benet &amp; Company of Beverly Hills, California was contractor with L. D. Richardson serving as project superintendent.

The hotel opened on February 23, 1929.

=== William Wrigley Jr. becomes full owner ===

In 1930, the McArthurs (the owners) lost control of the property to one of their primary investors, William Wrigley Jr., who became full owner. The nearby Wrigley Mansion was built in 1931 and now operates as a private club.

In March 1952, Ronald and Nancy Reagan spent their honeymoon at the resort. Their favorite cottage in the resort was Cottage I.

=== Fire ===
In 1970, the Wrigley family sold the hotel to the Talley family. 1973 almost spelled doom for the hotel: a large fire erupted on June 21, destroying interiors of large parts of the 3rd and 4th floors and tremendous water damage on the 2nd and ground floors. Investigators discovered that an arc from a welder installing a sprinkler system had started the blaze. Thirty-five (35) firetrucks and a hundred and fifty (150) fire fighters responded to the 6-alarm fire which resulted in $2.5 million of damage.

It was announced immediately by the new owners that this famed hotel would be rebuilt in 90 days and opened on schedule for its regular winter season the last week of September 1973. The prompt re-building included new custom designed carpets throughout the hotel, new furniture for guest rooms and public areas, new restaurant kitchen equipment, and renovated public interiors throughout the hotel. &quot;Saguaros&quot;, a design by Wright for the cover of Liberty Magazine, was fabricated by Taliesin students during the remodeling of the hotel and was installed in the lobby. Three separate crews were employed around the clock. In the wee hours before opening day, the final carpets were laid and the deadline had been met by a partnership of the owner, Talley Industries, the general contractor, J.R. Porter Construction Co., and the architect, Taliesin Associated Architects.

=== Expansions ===
After the 1973 fire the hotel began planning for an expansion. The 89-room Paradise Wing completed in 1975 was the first major expansion of the hotel since it had opened. The new wing was designed by John Rattenbury of Taliesin Associated Architects. M. M. Sundt Construction Company was general contractor for the new Paradise Wing and used precast concrete planes which are 18 square feet. The forms for the concrete panels were crafted using the &quot;Biltmore blocks&quot; forms to achieve a uniform look with the original building. In 1979 the Taliesin-designed 120-room Valley Wing and a 39,000 square foot conference center opened. In 1982 the 109-room Terrace Court Wing was added, a Taliesin design similar to the existing architecture. General contractor for the Terrace Court was D. L. Construction.

=== Change of ownership ===

In 1979, the hotel was taken over by the Rostland Corporation. In 1983, it became a Leper DBL Biltmore Association property, and in 1992 it was re-sold, to the Grossman Properties. A spa was opened in 1998.

In July 1999, Florida Panther Holdings, Inc. acquired the property from Grossman Company Properties for $228.5M ($126M cash, $100M Florida Panther stock, and $62.5 debt assumption). Also, in 1999 Florida Panther Holdings, Inc. changed its name to Boca Resorts, Inc. At the time, Florida Panthers Holdings, Inc. also owned the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club, the Registry Resort, the Edgewater Beach Hotel, the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Resort and Marina, the Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center and Grande Oaks Golf Club. The company also owned the Florida Panthers Hockey Club and had interests in the operations of the National Car Rental Center located in Sunrise, Florida and the Miami Arena.

In December 2000, Boca Resorts, Inc. sold the hotel for $335 million to KSL Recreation, Inc. KSL retained the hotel until April 2004, when it was sold to the Orlando, Florida-based REIT, CNL Hotels &amp; Resorts as part of the corporate acquisition of six of KSL&#x27;s seven resort assets. CNL was sold to Morgan Stanley in 2007. In 2011, lenders including Paulson &amp; Co., Winthrop Realty Trust and Capital Trust foreclosed on 8 of the former CNL hotels. in 2013, the owners reached a deal to sell the Biltmore and three other properties to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. Hilton operated it as a member of their luxury Waldorf-Astoria Collection until May 2024, when it was transferred to their LXR Hotels &amp; Resorts line.

=== Other notable events ===
In 2004, while doing a campaign stop in Arizona, United States president George W. Bush slept there, under strict security measures. Over 200 policemen, Secret Service agents and bomb-sniffing dogs were at hand.

On November 4, 2008, the McCain/Palin campaign hosted its final party at the hotel. Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate for president, conceded defeat when he spoke to reporters and disappointed supporters on the hotel&#x27;s lawn. Some supporters watched McCain&#x27;s speech via closed circuit TV from the ballroom. Former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer acted as master of ceremonies for the evening&#x27;s entertainment earlier in the evening, in the ballroom.

In 2009, the Arizona Biltmore marked its 80th anniversary with two additions that reinforced the history and architectural legacy of the resort. Ocatilla at Arizona Biltmore – a 120-room addition offering the resort&#x27;s most enhanced guest services, many complimentary amenities, club accommodations and Wright-inspired décor – was named for a compound Wright built in Phoenix&#x27;s South Mountains to serve as his secluded, inspirational workplace. A new restaurant, Frank &amp; Albert&#x27;s, was inspired by and named for Wright and McArthur. A menu was created – of comfort foods and American classics with an Arizona twist – reflecting the dual influences of the two architects.

The Arizona Biltmore was designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride and was listed in the Phoenix Historic Property Register in July 2009.

== Hotel features ==

=== Biltmore blocks ===

Authorship of the hotel&#x27;s design is not a new dispute. Wright wanted square blocks as opposed to McArthur&#x27;s mathematically proportioned rectangle block that was used. The pre-cast blocks which McArthur used became known as the “Biltmore Blocks&quot;. The blocks had a diverse geometric design and were made on site from desert sand.

Wright had condemned McArthur&#x27;s use of the block system and publicly claimed credit for the building&#x27;s design. Nonetheless, Wright issued a carefully worded letter in 1930 that was published in &quot;The Architectural Record&quot; (quoted in Brendan Gill&#x27;s &quot;Many Masks&quot;):

=== History Room ===

The Biltmore History Room is located on the third floor. In the room there are displays of not only historical artifacts related to the hotel&#x27;s history, but also the early furnishes which were once used. Among the historical artifacts on display is a wooden key which Scenic Airways dropped on the roof of the ballroom on February 23, 1929, the opening day of the hotel. The key is on display above the room&#x27;s fireplace.

=== Mystery Room ===

On the second floor of the hotel there was a room known as the Mystery Room. It was called the &quot;Men&#x27;s Smoking Room&quot; where supposedly the men who were guests went to smoke cigars. This was during the days of Prohibition (1920 to 1933) and the name of the room was a disguise because its true function in the night was that of a speakeasy. Only the guests that knew the secret password were allowed in. In the room there was a bar behind a revolving bookcase where the illegal alcoholic drinks were served. The hotel placed a beacon light (spotlight) atop the hotel whose official purpose was to alert the speakeasy guests in the event that the police arrived to raid the place. A hotel employee would be stationed on the roof and if he saw any police cars he would flash the spotlight on the skylight of the Mystery Room. When the guests in the room saw the light, they would return to their rooms through secret passageways. What is now an entry door to the room used to be an exit door behind a wall sealed off from the rest of the hallway so that police wouldn&#x27;t see guests leaving. Actors Clark Gable and Carole Lombard would often stay in room 1201 (now known as the Clark Gable room) which was right next door to the Mystery Room. Their room had a secret passageway to the Mystery Room. The room is now used for meetings and conferences.

=== Gold Room ===

Clark Gable and friends used to dine in the Gold Room. The 7,000 square foot ballroom could accommodate 480 guests. The Gold Room, with the gold leaf ceiling, was the original dining room of the Biltmore. It featured dancing and a live orchestra every night. The gold leaf ceiling and windows are from the original structure. There are two murals on the walls: &quot;Legend of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Warrior Twins&quot; by Maynard Dixon (a 20th-century American artist whose body of work focused on the American West) which were done on Belgian Linen.

=== Aztec Room ===

The Aztec Room was the original ballroom of the Biltmore. The 2,800 square feet room has a gold leaf ceiling and copper beams. Frank Lloyd Wright was instrumental in the room&#x27;s design which had few or no adjustments.

=== Catalina Pool ===
In 1940, the &quot;Catalina Pool&quot; aka &quot;Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s Pool&quot; and the &quot;Cowboy Bunkhouse&quot; areas opened. These became favorite areas of Hollywood celebrities. The Catalina Pool was Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s favorite and she was often seen around the pool area sunbathing. Catalina pool supposedly is where Irving Berlin penned the iconic song “White Christmas”. Martha Raye was photographed playing chess on a large chessboard around the &quot;Cowboy&quot; house.

== Original Tequila Sunrise ==

The Tequila sunrise is an alcoholic cocktail whose ingredients include tequila, Crème de Cassis, fresh squeezed lime juice and Club Soda. It was invented in the late 1930s by bartender Gene Sulit. Sulit was attending customers in the hotel&#x27;s &quot;Wright&quot; bar when one particular customer asked Sulit if he could come up with a new drink to be enjoyed at poolside. Sulit mixed the ingredients mentioned above and the drink became known as the Biltmore Tequila Sunrise.

<doc id="479981" wikidata="Q685318" url="?curid=479981" title="Mactan">
<text>Mactan is a densely populated island located a few kilometers (~1 mile) east of Cebu Island in the Philippines. The island is part of Cebu province and it is divided into the city of Lapu-Lapu and the municipality of Cordova. 

The island is separated from Cebu by the Mactan Channel which is presently crossed by three bridges: the Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX), the Mactan–Mandaue Bridge, and the Marcelo Fernan Bridge. The island covers some and has a population of 527,071 as of 2020, making it the nation&#x27;s most densely populated island. Along with Olango Island Group, the isles are administered by a city and a municipality covering .

Mactan–Cebu International Airport is located on the island.

==Etymology==

The modern name Mactan descended from an earlier form, &quot;Manctan&quot;. However, evidence of this earlier form is scant as, even as early as the 17th century, the island was already named Mactan. This form is attested in the original copy of the Philippine Declaration of Independence, where Lapu-Lapu was mentioned as the king of &quot;Manktan&quot;. This is supported by oral histories, which claim that the name Mactan evolved from the name &quot;Mangatang&quot;. 

The name means &quot;pirate&quot; (lit. &quot;those who lie in wait&quot;), and was acquired during a period where the island&#x27;s population would prey on passing trade ships on the way to the harbors of Sugbu. The ancient name of the island in precolonial times is Opong, which became the name of the Spanish settlement of Opon (renamed to Lapu-Lapu in 1961).

==History==
The island was already a thriving settlement before it was colonized by Spain in the 16th century. It was a strong ally of the Lakanate of Lawan, a prosperous kingdom in Samar. Datu Hadi Iberein ruled the Lakanate of Lawan. He was described by historian William Henry Scott as a &quot;Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains.&quot; 

Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived on the island in 1521 and became involved in warfare among the kingdoms only to be killed in battle by the warriors of Datu Lapu-Lapu, the sovereign in the island. However, oral tradition also dictates that the island where the Battle of Mactan might have taken place is Poro Island in the northeast instead. The oral tradition is backed by recent archaeological evidence of such a battle taking place in Poro island during the 16th century.

By 1730, the Catholic Augustinian friars established the town of Opon. It was later renamed as the city of Lapu-Lapu by means of the Republic Act 3134, signed by Pres. Carlos P. Garcia on June 17, 1961. Congressman Manuel A. Zosa, the representative of the Sixth District of Cebu, sponsored the Bill converting the former municipality of Opon into the present day City of Lapu-Lapu.

==Economy==

Apart from the airport, today the island is known for its industrial factories, which are some of the most successful industrial ventures in the Philippines. Many of them are located at the Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ), an industrial tax-free zone opened in 1979 that includes over 35 business ventures, about 50 percent of which are Japanese-owned.

Also important to the island is its high-class tourism industry and the production of furniture, as well as guitars, ukuleles and other musical instruments.

On April 27, 2024, Marcos with Junard Chan, led the capsule-laying for Megaworld Corporation&#x27;s PHP1.5-billion Mactan Expo Center project.

==Tourist attractions==

Being one of the major tourist islands of Cebu, Mactan Island boasts of a diverse collection of tourist spots and attractions. Being a coral island.
