<text>Fanqie () is a method in traditional Chinese lexicography to indicate the pronunciation of a monosyllabic character by using two other characters, one with the same initial consonant as the desired syllable and one with the same rest of the syllable (the final).
The method was introduced in the 3rd century AD and is to some extent still used in commentaries on the classics and dictionaries.

== History ==
Early dictionaries such as the &quot;Erya&quot; (3rd century BC) indicated the pronunciation of a character by the &quot;dúruò&quot; (讀若, &quot;read as&quot;) method, giving another character with the same pronunciation. The introduction of Buddhism to China around the 1st century brought Indian phonetic knowledge, which may have inspired the idea of &quot;fanqie&quot;. According to the 6th-century scholar Yan Zhitui, &quot;fanqie&quot; were first used by Sun Yan (孫炎), of the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), in his &quot;Erya Yinyi&quot; (爾雅音義, &quot;Sounds and Meanings of &quot;Erya&quot;&quot;). However, earlier examples have been found in the late-2nd-century works of Fu Qian and Ying Shao.

The oldest extant sources of significant bodies of &quot;fanqie&quot; are fragments of the original &quot;Yupian&quot; (544 AD) found in Japan and the &quot;Jingdian Shiwen&quot;, a commentary on the classics that was written in 583 AD. The method was used throughout the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, a Chinese rhyme dictionary published in 601 AD during the Sui dynasty. When Classical Chinese poetry flowered during the Tang dynasty, the &quot;Qieyun&quot; became the authoritative source for literary pronunciations. Several revisions and enlargements were produced, the most important of which was the &quot;Guangyun&quot; (1007–1008). Even after the more sophisticated rime table analysis was developed, &quot;fanqie&quot; continued to be used in dictionaries, including the voluminous &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot;, published in 1716, and the &quot;Ciyuan&quot; and &quot;Cihai&quot; of the 1930s.

During the Qing dynasty, some bilingual Chinese-Manchu dictionaries had the Manchu words phonetically transcribed with Chinese characters. The book 御製增訂清文鑑 (&quot;Imperially Published Revised and Enlarged Mirror of Qing&quot;), in both Manchu and Chinese, used Manchu script to transcribe Chinese words and Chinese characters to transcribe Manchu words by using &quot;fanqie&quot;.

== Function ==

In the &quot;fanqie&quot; method, a character&#x27;s pronunciation is represented by two other characters. The onset (initial consonant) is represented by that of the first of the two characters (上字 &quot;upper word&quot;, as Chinese was written vertically); the final (including the medial glide, the nuclear vowel and the coda) and the tone are represented by those of the second of the two characters (下字, &quot;lower word&quot;). For example, in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, the character is described by the formula 德紅反. The first two characters indicate the onset and the final, respectively, and so the pronunciation of 東 is given as the onset of with the final of , with the same tone as 紅.

In the rhyme dictionaries, there was a tendency to choose pairs of characters that agree on the presence or absence of a palatal medial &quot;-j-&quot;, but there was no such tendency for the rounded medial &quot;-w-&quot;, which was represented solely in the final character.
There was also a strong tendency to spell words with labial initials using final characters with labial initials.

The third character &quot;fǎn&quot; &quot;turn back&quot; is the usual marker of a &quot;fanqie&quot; spelling in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;. In later dictionaries such as the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, the marker character is &quot;qiè&quot; &quot;run together&quot;. (The commonly-cited reading &quot;cut&quot; seems to be modern.) The Qing scholar Gu Yanwu suggested that &quot;fǎn&quot;, which also meant &quot;overthrow&quot;, was avoided after the devastating rebellions during the middle of the Tang dynasty. The origin of both terms is obscure.
The compound word &quot;fǎnqiè&quot; first appeared during the Song dynasty.

== Analysis ==
&quot;Fanqie&quot; provide information about the sounds of earlier forms of Chinese, but its recovery is not straightforward. Several characters could be used for each initial or final, and in particular, no character was ever used to spell itself.

However, it is possible to identify the initials and the finals underlying a large and consistent collection of &quot;fanqie&quot; by using a method that was first used by the Cantonese scholar Chen Li, in his 1842 study of the &quot;Guangyun&quot;.
For example, in that dictionary,
* 東 was spelled 德 + 紅,
* 德 was spelled 多 + 特, and
* 多 was spelled 德 + 河.
That implies that 東, 德 and 多 must all have had the same initial. By following such chains of equivalence, Chen was able to identify categories of equivalent initial spellers, and a similar process was possible for the finals.
Unaware of Chen&#x27;s work, the Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren repeated the analysis to identify the initials and finals in the 1910s.

Chen&#x27;s method can be used to identify the categories of initials and finals, but not their sound values, for which other evidence is required.
Thus, Middle Chinese has been reconstructed by Karlgren and later scholars by comparing those categories with Sino-Xenic pronunciations and the pronunciations in modern varieties of Chinese.

== Effects of sound change ==
The method described the pronunciations of characters in Middle Chinese, but the relationships have been obscured as the language evolved into the modern varieties over the last millennium and a half. Middle Chinese had four tones, and initial plosives and affricates could be voiced, aspirated or voiceless unaspirated. Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers (traditionally known as 陰 and 陽) conditioned by the initials. Voicing then disappeared in all dialects except the Wu group, with voiced initials becoming aspirated or unaspirated depending on the tone. The tones then underwent further mergers in various varieties of Chinese. Thus, the changes in both the initial and the tone were conditioned on each other, as represented by different characters in the pair.

For example, the characters of formula 東 = 德 + 紅 are pronounced , and in modern Standard Chinese; thus, the tones no longer match. That is because the voiceless initial and the voiced initial condition different registers of the Middle Chinese level tone, yielding the first and the second tones of the modern language. (The pinyin letter represents the voiceless and unaspirated stop .)

That effect sometimes led to a form of spelling pronunciation. Chao Yuen Ren cited the example of the character , which had two readings in Middle Chinese. It could be read as in the level tone, meaning &#x27;strong, powerful&#x27;, which developed regularly into the modern reading . However, it could be read also as in the rising tone, meaning &#x27;stubborn&#x27; or &#x27;forced&#x27;. The regular development would be for the voiced initial to condition the register of the rising tone, becoming the fourth tone of modern Chinese and for the rising tone to condition an unaspirated initial.
Thus, would be expected, and this does occur in the sense &#x27;stubborn&#x27;, but the character also has the unexpected pronunciation for the sense &#x27;forced&#x27;. Chao attributed that to the formula 强 = (level tone) + (rising tone) given in dictionaries. Here, the first character is now pronounced because in the level tone, the voiced initial becomes aspirated. However, the second character is now pronounced because in the rising tone, sonorants like conditioned the register, which led to the modern third tone.

==Use in Cantonese==
In Cantonese, fanqie can be found in some dictionaries to this day, often alongside other romanization system or phonetic guides, to indicate the pronunciation of characters lacking a homophone.

For example, in the Sun Ya dictionary the character 攀 is transcribed as pinyin &quot;pān&quot; and for Cantonese &quot;pan¹&quot; and the Cantonese tonal homophone 扳 , whereas 戀, lacking a tonal homophone, is transcribed as &quot;lyn²&quot; and 〔拉婉切〕 (l-āai + yún) to give lyún. If there is no tonal homophone, the tone is indicated. For example 實用廣州話分類詞典 transcribes 仆 as and fanqie 〔披屋切〕 (p-ēi + ūk) but 𠵿, lacking a tonal homophone is transcribed as and 〔音披爺切第1聲〕, i.e. p-ēi + y-èh with tone 1 to give pē.

<text>A rime table or rhyme table () is a Chinese phonological model, tabulating the syllables of the series of rime dictionaries beginning with the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601) by their onsets, rhyme groups, tones and other properties. The method gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of those dictionaries than the previously used  analysis, but many of its details remain obscure. The phonological system that is implicit in the rime dictionaries and analysed in the rime tables is known as Middle Chinese, and is the traditional starting point for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese. Some authors distinguish the two layers as Early and Late Middle Chinese respectively.

The earliest rime tables are associated with Chinese Buddhist monks, who are believed to have been inspired by the Sanskrit syllable charts in the Siddham script they used to study the language. The oldest extant rime tables are the 12th-century &quot;Yunjing&quot; (&#x27;mirror of rhymes&#x27;) and &quot;Qiyin lüe&quot; (&#x27;summary of the seven sounds&#x27;), which are very similar, and believed to derive from a common prototype. Earlier fragmentary documents describing the analysis have been found at Dunhuang, suggesting that the tradition may date back to the late Tang dynasty.

Some scholars, such as the Swedish linguist Bernhard Karlgren, use the French spelling &quot;rime&quot; for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.

==History==
The &quot;Qieyun&quot;, produced by Lu Fayan () in 601, was a rime dictionary, serving as a guide to the recitation of literary texts and an aid in the composition of verse. It quickly became popular during the Tang dynasty, leading to a series of revised and expanded editions, the most important of which was the &quot;Guangyun&quot; (1008). In these dictionaries, characters were grouped first by the four tones, and then into rhyme groups. Each rhyme group was subdivided into groups of homophonous characters, with the pronunciation of each given by a &quot;fanqie&quot; formula, a pair of familiar characters indicating the sounds of the initial and final parts of a syllable respectively. The dictionaries typically used several characters for each initial or final.

The fanqie method of indicating pronunciation made the dictionaries awkward to use. The ( &#x27;study of classified rhymes&#x27;) was a more sophisticated analysis of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; pronunciations, initially developed by Chinese Buddhist monks who were studying Indian linguistics. A tantalizing glimpse of this tradition is offered by fragments from Dunhuang. A fragment held by the British Library (Or.8210/S.512) simply lists 30 initial consonants. Another document includes three fragments attributed to a monk called Shǒuwēn (), who may have lived as early as the 9th century. These fragments do not contain tables, but describe the phonological analysis that underlies them.

The oldest known rhyme tables are a version of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; published with prefaces dated 1161 and 1203, and the &quot;Qiyin lüe&quot;, which was included in the 1161 encyclopedia &quot;Tongzhi&quot;. The two are very similar, and are believed to be derived from a single version pre-dating the Song dynasty. The tables were accompanied by a body of teachings known as ( &#x27;school precepts&#x27;), including rules for placing fanqie spellings that did not conform to the system within the tables.

Later rhyme tables were more elaborate. The () was probably created during the Northern Song, and explicitly introduced broad rhyme classes ( ), which were previously implicit in the ordering of the tables. The preface of the () is dated 1203, in the Southern Song. In this work the tables are restructured with separate columns for each of the 36 initials. The (), produced by Liú Jiàn () in 1336, was the basis for one of the two sets of rime tables at the front of the Kangxi dictionary.

The &quot;Yunjing&quot; was lost in China for several centuries. The &quot;Qieyun zhizhangtu&quot;, incorrectly attributed to the 11th century scholar Sima Guang, was believed to be the oldest of the rime tables, and was used in the earliest reconstruction efforts. However, in the 1880s several versions of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; were discovered in Japan. Comparison with the &quot;Qiyin lüe&quot; showed that they were based on a common model, of which the other rime tables were later refinements. All recent reconstruction work has been based on the &quot;Yunjing&quot;. The () edition of 1564 is considered the most reliable, and is the basis of all reproductions in circulation.

==Structure==
In the medieval rime dictionaries, characters were organized into rhyme groups ( ), with 193 groups in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, growing to 206 in the &quot;Guangyun&quot;. The order of the rhyme groups within each tone implies a correspondence between rhyme groups across the four tones. Thus for each rhyme group with an -m, -n or -ng coda in the level tone there are typically corresponding rhyme groups with the same coda in the rising and departing tones, and a corresponding rhyme group in the entering tone with a -p, -t or -k coda respectively. In contrast, syllables with vocalic codas typically had corresponding rhyme groups only in the level, rising and departing tones. There were also four departing tone rhyme groups with -j codas that had no counterparts in the other tones.

The rime tables were solely concerned with the pronunciation of syllables of these rime dictionaries, and do not contain dictionary-like material such as definitions. Similarly, where a group of characters are recorded as homophones in the rime dictionaries, typically only one will occur in a rime table. A rime table book presents these distinct syllables in a number of tabular charts, each devoted to one or more sets of parallel rhyme groups across the tones.

The preface to &quot;Qieyun&quot; indicates that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations from the late Northern and Southern dynasties period. Most linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions it recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere. The rime tables were compiled centuries later in the time of a new standard, and many of the distinctions in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; would have been meaningless to the compilers. Edwin Pulleyblank has argued that the tables contain enough evidence to reconstruct the speech of that later period. He calls this language Late Middle Chinese (LMC) in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, and argues that it was the standard speech of the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an in the late Tang dynasty. His reconstruction accounts for most of the distinctions in modern varieties of Chinese (except Min), as well as layers of Chinese loanwords, such as the Kan-on layer of Sino-Japanese vocabulary.

=== Tables ===
Each chart of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; is labelled as either &quot;open&quot; ( ) or &quot;closed&quot; (). The corresponding terms in the &quot;Qiyin lüe&quot; are &quot;heavy&quot; () and &quot;light&quot; (). The open/closed distinction is interpreted to indicate the absence or presence of lip rounding (often transcribed as -w- or -u-). Some &quot;Guangyun&quot; rhyme groups include syllables of both kinds, and thus span two charts, while others are purely &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;, and thus fit within one chart. Charts are grouped together in broad rhyme classes (), each characterized as either &quot;inner&quot; () or &quot;outer&quot; (), thought to be related to vowel heights, contrasting close vowels and open vowels respectively.

For example, the first of the 43 charts of the &quot;Yùnjìng&quot; is shown below (the Arabic numerals are modern annotations):

The five big characters on the right-hand side read (內轉第一開). In the &quot;Yùnjìng&quot;, each chart is called (lit. &#x27;turn&#x27;). The characters indicate that the chart is the first (第一) one in the book, and that the syllables of this chart are &quot;inner&quot; (內) and &quot;open&quot; (開).

The columns of each table classify syllables according to their initial consonant ( 聲母 lit. &#x27;sound mother&#x27;), with syllables beginning with a vowel considered to have a &quot;zero initial&quot;. Initials are classified according to
* place of articulation: labials ( 脣 &#x27;lip&#x27;), alveolars ( 舌 &#x27;tongue&#x27;), velars ( 牙 &#x27;back tooth&#x27;), affricates and sibilants ( 齒 &quot;front tooth&quot;), and laryngeals ( 喉 &#x27;throat&#x27;). The values of the last category remain controversial.
* manner of articulation: voiceless ( 清 &#x27;clear&#x27;), voiceless aspirated ( 次清 &#x27;secondary clear&#x27;), voiced ( 濁 &#x27;muddy&#x27;) or nasal or liquid ( 清濁 &#x27;clear muddy&#x27;).
The order of the places and manners roughly match that of Sanskrit, providing further evidence of inspiration from Indian phonology.

Each table had 16 rows, with a group of four rows for each of the four tones of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;.
The above chart covers four parallel &quot;Guangyun&quot; rhyme groups, the level-toned , the rising-toned , the departing-toned , and the entering-toned (which in Middle Chinese ended in -k, the entering tone counterpart of -ng).

Within each tone group are four rows known as (等 &#x27;class&#x27;, &#x27;grade&#x27; or &#x27;group&#x27;), which Bernhard Karlgren translated as &quot;divisions&quot; while other linguists prefer &quot;grades&quot;. They are usually denoted by Roman numerals I to IV. Their meaning remains the most controversial aspect of rime table phonology, but is believed to indicate palatalization (transcribed as the presence or absence of -j- or -i-), retroflex features, phonation, vowel quality (high vs. low or front vs. back) or some combination of these. Other scholars view them not as phonetic categories but formal devices exploiting distributional patterns in the &quot;Qieyun&quot; to achieve a compact presentation.

The symbol ○ indicates that that particular syllable does not occur.

Bernard Karlgren noticed that classes of finals from the rime dictionaries were placed in different rows of the rime tables. As three classes of final occurred in the first, second and fourth rows respectively, he named them finals of divisions I, II and IV. The remaining finals he called &quot;division-III finals&quot; because they occurred in the third row of the tables. Some of these (the &quot;pure&quot; division-III finals) occurred only in that row, while others (the &quot;mixed&quot; finals) could also occur in the second or fourth rows with some initials.

Later workers noted that in the so-called  rhyme groups, , , , , , , and , a consistent distinction within each rhyme group in the rime books is reflected in the rime tables by dividing the rhyme group between rows 2 and 4, often in adjacent tables. Li Rong, in a systematic comparison of the rhyme tables with a recently discovered early edition of the , identified seven classes of finals. The table below lists the combinations of initial and final classes that occur in the , with the row of the rime tables in which each combination was placed:
The mixed and finals, though designated as division-III finals, are spread across rows 2 and 4 as well as row 3 of the tables.
To handle these cases, a distinction is made between the row that the homophone class is placed in and the &quot;division&quot; of its final. This article distinguishes rows by Arabic numerals 1 2 3 4 and divisions by Roman numerals I II III IV.

In addition, division-II and division-IV finals occur only in &quot;outer&quot; .

This distribution is the foundation of the compact tabular presentation of rime dictionary syllables.
For example, the dental and retroflex stop initials are combined in a single group in a rime table, with the rows distinguishing the different initials, and the three groups of sibilant initials are similarly combined. In a similar fashion different finals may occupy different rows of the same chart.

The rhyme groups (here illustrated in the level tone, except where a group occurs only in the departing tone) are distributed across the 43 charts of the and as follows:

In some cases, the already reflected the open/closed distinction with separate rhyme groups, while in others they were included in the same group.

==Thirty-six initials==
The earliest documentary records of the rime table tradition, the Dunhuang fragments, contain lists of 30 initials, each named after an exemplary character. This was later expanded to a standard set of 36 in the preface of the &quot;Yunjing&quot;, the major addition being a series of labiodental fricatives split from the labial series:

Tables of the &quot;Yunjing&quot; have only 23 columns, with one group of columns each for labials, coronals and sibilants, with the different types placed in different rows of the tables.
Some later tables such as the &quot;Qieyun zhizhangtu&quot; have 36 columns, one for each of the 36 initials.

The 36 initials were so influential that it was not until 1842 that it was discovered (by Chen Li) that the initials of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; were slightly different.

There is some variation in the transcription of the initials and . The table above uses and . Other conventions are vs nothing, vs , and mid dot vs . These conventions carry over to other scripts of the Sinological tradition, such as ʼPhags-pa and Jurchen.

<text>Otto Fritz Meyerhof (; 12 April 1884 – 6 October 1951) was a German physician and biochemist who won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.

==Biography==
Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born in Hannover, at Theaterplatz 16A (now:Rathenaustrasse 16A), the son of wealthy Jewish parents. In 1888, his family moved to Berlin, where Otto spent most of his childhood, and where he started his study of medicine. He continued these studies in Strasbourg and Heidelberg, from which he graduated in 1909, with a work titled &quot;Contributions to the Psychological Theory of Mental Illness&quot;.

In Heidelberg, he met Hedwig Schallenberg. They married in 1914 and had three children together: a daughter, Bettina, and two sons, Gottfried (who after emigration used the anglicized name Geoffrey) and Walter.

In 1912, Otto Meyerhof moved to the University of Kiel, where he received a professorship in 1918. In 1922, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine, with Archibald Vivian Hill, for his work on muscle metabolism, including glycolysis. In 1929, he became one of the directors of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, a position he held until 1938, when Jews were expelled from university teaching positions.

To escape the increasing oppression of Jews by the Nazi regime, in 1938 Meyerhof emigrated with his family to Paris. After the fall of France in 1940, they fled to Marseille. Aided by the Emergency Rescue Committee, they left the country by ship to the United States that year. Meyerhof was appointed to a guest professorship at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Meyerhof died in Philadelphia at the age of 67. In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize, he was recognized for his contributions to the study of glycolysis, by the naming of the common series of reactions for the pathway in Eukaryotes as the &quot;Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas Pathway&quot;.

<doc id="475094" wikidata="Q798748" url="?curid=475094" title="Bad News (band)">
<text>Bad News are a fictional English heavy metal band created for the Channel 4 television series &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot;. Its members were Vim Fuego (played by Ade Edmondson) on vocals and lead guitar; Den Dennis (Nigel Planer) on rhythm guitar; Colin Grigson (Rik Mayall) on bass; and Spider &quot;Eight-Legs&quot; Webb (Peter Richardson) on drums. The band continued outside the context of the TV series, with the actors (in character) eventually playing a number of live gigs as Bad News, and recording an album (1987&#x27;s &quot;Bad News&quot;) and a single (a cover of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) that made the UK charts.

==Biography==
===Early incarnation: &quot;Bad News Tour&quot; (1983)===
Bad News made their television debut during 1983, in the first series of &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; (written by Edmondson, and produced by Michael White/Comic Strip Productions). The episode, &quot;Bad News Tour&quot;, took the form of a satirical fly-on-the-wall rockumentary, in which the incompetent band is followed travelling to a gig in Grantham, by an almost equally inept documentary film crew: It seemed to take much inspiration from Mark Kidel&#x27;s 1976 BBC documentary &quot;So You Wanna Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star?&quot; that followed the Kursaal Flyers around Scotland and northeast England. In the episode, Bad News is a band just starting out; they have no recording contract, no management, no crew, and have apparently only been together for a short while. The 30-minute documentary follows them on their &quot;tour&quot; (apparently only one gig), which is an unqualified disaster ... only four people show up. Along the way, there is much inter-group squabbling as Bad News are profiled by &quot;rock journalist extraordinaire&quot; Sally Freidman (Jennifer Saunders), and pick up a schoolgirl groupie named Tracy (Dawn French). The episode was filmed in autumn 1982 and was coincidentally in production at the same time as the similar mock-documentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, which was released in 1984 to a much wider audience.

The &quot;Bad News Tour&quot; episode is notable for featuring songs (written by Edmondson and Simon Brint) that do not appear on either of the Bad News albums or in the later TV episode. These rare tunes are &quot;Bad News&quot; (Version 1), &quot;The Motorbike Song&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Doing A Ton Down The Highway&quot;), a brief snippet of a song whose title is unknown, and an almost complete live version of &quot;Mr Rock N Roll&quot;. These tunes represent the only released Bad News material not co-produced by the Queen guitarist, Brian May.

The opening sequence of &quot;Bad News Tour&quot; shows Vim living in the notorious Chantry Point tower block on the Elgin Estate in west London. The block was demolished in 1992.

===Revival: Monsters of Rock (1986), &quot;Bad News&quot; (1987), &quot;More Bad News&quot; (1988) and &quot;Bootleg&quot; (1988)===
After a pause of a few years, the previously fictional-only band became an entity in real life when Bad News were invited to play at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in 1986. A feature of the band&#x27;s on-stage antics that day was a method of coping with the crowd&#x27;s plastic (and often urine-filled) bottle barrage, which was then a traditional (if somewhat awkward) welcome for bands playing at the festival in those days. Before the performance began properly, the band spent time just running around on stage dodging missiles, with Mayall using his guitar as a bat in an attempt to return some. They also played a low-key London show at the Marquee Club, with guest appearances by Jeff Beck and Brian May, and several other gigs, including opening for Iron Maiden and a show with a guest appearance from Jimmy Page.

All this was in aid of promoting an eponymously titled Bad News album, consisting of thrashy rock songs punctuated by frequent squabbling amongst the band&#x27;s members. Brian May produced the record, which included a cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. That track peaked at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1987. A 1987 UK tour was put on, with May appearing during the encores.

The band&#x27;s performance at the Monsters of Rock festival was the centre piece of a follow-up &quot;Comic Strip&quot; episode, &quot;More Bad News&quot;, broadcast by Channel 4 in 1988. In this one-hour mock-documentary, the band is once again profiled by &quot;rock journalist extraordinaire&quot; Sally Freidman (Jennifer Saunders); Dawn French plays a different character this time, the band&#x27;s manager Rachel. It is explained that Bad News &quot;broke up&quot; in 1983, six months after the original documentary was filmed, due to extreme personality conflicts. (A snippet of a supposed 1983 appearance on &quot;The Tube&quot; is shown, with Bad News being interviewed by Jools Holland before it devolves into a screaming match). Five years later, the band is put back together again at Freidman&#x27;s instigation, and now has an opportunity to record a song (&quot;Warriors of Ghengis Khan&quot;) and make a video for it. Behind-the-scenes footage of the recording and video shoot are shown, but the single flops, and the band is in debt to their record company (&quot;Frilly Pink Records&quot;) when the opportunity to play the Monsters Of Rock festival comes along. In the film, highlights from the concert are shown, but it ends with Bad News&#x27; terrible performance causing a riot, and the members of Bad News being beaten mercilessly by the crowd and by the police. The documentary ends with all four members of Bad News in hospital, severely injured. Dennis (the only band member still actually capable of speech) muses that if Vim dies from his injuries and they market it properly, the band might be successful yet.

Bad News appeared at the 1987 Reading Festival and were joined onstage by Brian May for a performance of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

Later in 1988, the band issued the largely spoken word album &quot;Bootleg&quot;, which ostensibly consisted of dialogue (mostly interband arguments) recorded during the sessions for &quot;Bad News&quot;. In 1989, a CD reissue of the &quot;Bad News&quot; album combined tracks from both albums; the later &quot;Cash In Compilation&quot; (1992) compiled many of the same tracks.

===Later activity===
In 2012, for the &quot;30 Years of Comic Strip&quot; documentary, Planer and Richardson returned as Den Dennis and Spider Webb respectively to recall stories from their time as Bad News. In the documentary, the post-1988 fates of the Bad News members were revealed: Alan (Vim) returned to his business as a painter and decorator, with Den assisting him; Colin&#x27;s father got him a job as a bank clerk; and Spider retired to the West Country with his partner and three children. It&#x27;s also revealed that Vim and Sally eventually married—just as their portrayers Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders were married in real life.

In 2019, a vinyl record of Bad News rarities (&quot;Almost Rare&quot;) appeared. The following year, the band issued a 2-CD live compilation of material recorded in 1986, including a complete gig at the Hammersmith Odeon and their Monsters Of Rock show live at Donington.

<text>The Qieyun () is a Chinese rime dictionary that was published in 601 during the Sui dynasty. The book was a guide to proper reading of classical texts, using the &quot;fanqie&quot; method to indicate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. The &quot;Qieyun&quot; and later redactions, notably the &quot;Guangyun&quot;, are important documentary sources used in the reconstruction of historical Chinese phonology.

==History==
The book was created by Lu Fayan (Lu Fa-yen; ) in 601. The preface of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; describes how the plan of the book originated from a discussion with eight of his friends 20 years earlier at his home in Chang&#x27;an, the capital of Sui China.

None of these scholars was originally from Chang&#x27;an; they were native speakers of differing dialects – five northern and three southern. According to Lu, Yan Zhitui (顏之推) and Xiao Gai (), both men originally from the south, were the most influential in setting up the norms on which the &quot;Qieyun&quot; was based. However, the dictionary was compiled by Lu alone, consulting several earlier dictionaries, none of which have survived.

When classical Chinese poetry flowered during the Tang dynasty, the &quot;Qieyun&quot; became the authoritative source for literary pronunciations and it repeatedly underwent revisions and enlargements. It was annotated in 677 by Zhǎngsūn Nèyán (), revised and published in 706 by Wáng Renxu () as the &quot;Kanmiu Buque Qieyun&quot; (; &quot;Corrected and supplemented &quot;Qieyun&quot;&quot;), collated and republished in 751 by Sun Mian () as the &quot;Tángyùn&quot; (; &quot;Tang rimes&quot;), and eventually incorporated into the still-extant &quot;Guangyun&quot; and &quot;Jiyun&quot; rime dictionaries from the Song dynasty. Although most of these Tang dictionary redactions were believed lost, some fragments were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts and manuscripts discovered at Turpan.

The &quot;Qieyun&quot; reflected the enhanced phonological awareness that developed in China after the advent of Buddhism, which introduced the sophisticated Indian linguistics. The Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho used a version of the &quot;Qieyun&quot;.

During the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work. Particularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū&#x27;s edition made in the early 9th century by Wú Cǎiluán (), a woman famed for her calligraphy. One of these copies was acquired by Emperor Huizong (1100–1126), himself a keen calligrapher. It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor Puyi to Tianjin and then to Changchun, capital of the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in Liulichang, Beijing.

Studies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and Li Rong (1956).

==Structure==
The &quot;Qieyun&quot; contains 12,158 character entries. These were divided into five volumes, two for the many words of the &quot;level&quot; tone, and one volume for each of the other three tones. The entries were divided into 193 final rhyme groups (each named by its first character, called the &quot;yùnmù&quot; 韻目, or &quot;rhyme eye&quot;). Each rhyme group was subdivided into homophone groups (&quot;xiǎoyùn&quot; 小韻 &quot;small rhyme&quot;). The first entry in each homophone group gives the pronunciation as a &quot;fanqie&quot; formula.

For example, the first entry in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;, shown at right, describes the character 東 &quot;dōng&quot; &quot;east&quot;. The three characters on the right are a &quot;fanqie&quot; pronunciation key, marked by the character 反 &quot;fǎn&quot; &quot;turn back&quot;. This indicates that the word is pronounced with the initial of 德 [tək] and the final of 紅 [ɣuŋ], i.e. [tuŋ]. The word is glossed as 木方 &quot;mù fāng&quot;, i.e. the direction of wood (one of the Five Elements), while the numeral 二 &quot;two&quot; indicates that this is the first of two entries in a homophone group.

Later rime dictionaries had many more entries, with full definitions and a few additional rhyme groups, but kept the same structure.

The &quot;Qieyun&quot; did not directly record Middle Chinese as a spoken language, but rather how characters &quot;should&quot; be pronounced when reading the classics. Since this rime dictionary&#x27;s spellings are the primary source for reconstructing Middle Chinese, linguists have disagreed over what variety of Chinese it recorded. &quot;Much ink has been spilled concerning the nature of the language underlying the &quot;Qieyun&quot;,&quot; says Norman (1988: 24), who lists three points of view. Some scholars, like Bernhard Karlgren, &quot;held to the view that the &quot;Qieyun&quot; represented the language of Chang&#x27;an&quot;; some &quot;others have supposed that it represented an amalgam of regional pronunciations,&quot; technically known as a diasystem. &quot;At the present time, most people in the field accept the views of the Chinese scholar Zhou Zumo&quot; (周祖謨; 1914–1995) that &quot;Qieyun&quot; spellings were a north–south regional compromise between literary pronunciations from the Northern and Southern dynasties.

<text>Atahualpa Yupanqui (; born Héctor Roberto Chavero Aramburu; 31 January 1908 – 23 May 1992) was an Argentine-Spanish singer, songwriter, guitarist, and writer. He is considered one of the most important Argentine folk musicians of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Yupanqui was born Héctor Roberto Chavero Aramburu in Pergamino (Buenos Aires Province), in the Argentine pampas, about 200 kilometers from Buenos Aires. His father was a mestizo of Quechua and Basque origins, while his mother was born in the Basque country. His family moved to the city of Tucumán in northwestern Argentina when he was nine. In a bow to two legendary Incan kings, he adopted the stage name Atahualpa Yupanqui.

In his early years, Yupanqui traveled extensively through the northwest of Argentina and the Altiplano studying the indigenous cultures. He became politically active and joined the Communist Party of Argentina. In 1931, he took part in the failed Kennedy brothers uprising against the de facto government of José Félix Uriburu and in support of deposed president Hipólito Yrigoyen. After the uprising was defeated, he was forced to seek refuge in Uruguay. He returned to Argentina in 1934.

In 1935, Yupanqui paid his first visit to Buenos Aires; his compositions were growing in popularity, and he was invited to perform on the radio. Shortly thereafter, he made the acquaintance of pianist Antonieta Paula Pepin Fitzpatrick, nicknamed &quot;Nenette&quot;, who became his lifelong companion and musical collaborator under the pseudonym &quot;Pablo Del Cerro&quot;.

Because of his Communist Party affiliation (which lasted until 1952), his work suffered from censorship during Juan Perón&#x27;s presidency. He was detained and incarcerated several times. Between 1944 and 1949, he was exiled in Uruguay. In 1944 he was hired by Samuel V. de León to perform in the city of Durazno for the benefit of students of the city, who had been collecting money to fundraise for the Misiones Socio Pedagógicas. To mark his first visit to the city he composed &quot;A orillas del Yí&quot;, and dedicated it to Julio Martínez Oyanguren. In 1949, he travelled to Europe. Édith Piaf invited him to perform in Paris on 7 July 1950, and he soon signed a contract with Le Chant du Monde, the recording company that published his first LP in Europe, &quot;Minero Soy&quot; (I am a miner). This record won first prize for best foreign disc at an international folklore contest at the Académie Charles Cros, which had three hundred fifty participants from around the world. He subsequently toured extensively throughout Europe.
In 1952, Yupanqui returned to Buenos Aires. He broke with the Communist Party, which made it easier for him to book radio performances. With Nenette, they constructed their house on Cerro Colorado (Córdoba).

Recognition of Yupanqui&#x27;s ethnographic work became widespread during the 1960s, and nueva canción artists such as Facundo Cabral, Mercedes Sosa and Jorge Cafrune recorded his compositions and made him popular among younger musicians, who referred to him as &quot;Don Ata&quot;.

From 1963 to 1964, he toured Colombia, Japan, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, and Italy. In 1967, he toured Spain, and settled in Paris. He returned regularly to Argentina and appeared in Argentinísima II in 1973, but these visits became less frequent after Jorge Videla and his military dictatorship came to power in 1976.

==Awards and recognition==
In February 1968, Yupanqui was named a knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture, in honor of his 18 years of work enriching the literature of the French nation. Some of his songs are included in the programs of institutes and schools where Castilian literature is taught.

In 1985, the Argentinian Konex Foundation granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important popular musician in the last decade in his country.

In 1989, the University of Nanterre, France, commissioned Yupanqui to write the lyrics of a cantata to commemorate the of the French Revolution. The piece, entitled &quot;The Sacred Word&quot; (), was a tribute to oppressed peoples.

==Death==
Yupanqui died in Nîmes, France in 1992 at the age of 84; his remains were cremated and dispersed on his beloved Colorado Hill on 8 June 1992.

<text>Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (; 28 January 1608 – 31 December 1679) was a Renaissance Italian physiologist, physicist, and mathematician who is often described as the father of biomechanics. He contributed to the modern principle of scientific investigation by continuing Galileo&#x27;s practice of testing hypotheses against observation. Trained in mathematics, Borelli also made extensive studies of Jupiter&#x27;s moons, the mechanics of animal locomotion and, in microscopy, of the constituents of blood. He also used microscopy to investigate the stomatal movement of plants, and undertook studies in medicine and geology. During his career, he enjoyed the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden. He was the first scientist to explain that animal and human bodily movements are caused by muscular contractions.

==Biography==
Giovanni Borelli was born on 28 January 1608 in the district of Castel Nuovo, in Naples. He was the first-born son of Spanish infantryman Miguel Alfonso and a local woman named Laura Porello (alternately &quot;Porelli&quot; or &quot;Borelli&quot;.) Borelli had five siblings. 

Borelli eventually traveled to Rome where he studied physics under Benedetto Castelli, matriculating in mathematics at Sapienza University of Rome. From 1635 to 1656 he served as a Professor of Mathematics in Messina, Sicily. In 1635, the Senate of Messina offered him a membership in the prestigious Accademia della Fucina, which was an intellectual society of scientists devoted to studying and publishing largely on physical and natural sciences under the supervision and protection of the Senate. Borelli was designated to investigate &quot;the causes of the malignant fever that lashed a large part of Italy in 1647. He attributed the cause to an airborne infection and contested the prevailing opinion that the illness was due to excessive heat, humidity, or astrological influences.&quot; He even devised a treatment for the disease. While Borelli worked on studying the disease he also continued to study mathematics. In 1658 he published a revised version of Euclid&#x27;s Elements called, &quot;Euclides Restitutus&quot; (Euclid Restored). Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician whose book had been one of the most important mathematical texts for centuries. Borelli also revised Apollonius of Perga: Conics, a treatise on mathematics that examined parabolas and ellipses. Apollonius of Perga was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician. 

Around 1655, Borelli was invited to the University of Pisa by Ferdinando De&#x27; Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany. During this time he was acquainted with astronomer Galileo Galilei. While it is likely that they remained acquaintances, Galileo rejected considerations to nominate Borelli as head of Mathematics at the University of Pisa when he left the post himself. Borelli would attain this post in 1656. It was there that he first met the Italian anatomist Marcello Malpighi.

Borelli and Malpighi were both founder-members of the short-lived Accademia del Cimento, an Italian scientific academy founded in 1657. It was here that Borelli, piqued by Malpighi&#x27;s own studies, began his first investigations into the science of animal movement, or biomechanics. This began an interest that would continue for the rest of his life, eventually earning him the title of the Father of Biomechanics. Borelli&#x27;s involvement in the Accademia was temporary and the organization itself disbanded shortly after he left.

From 1664 to 1665, Borelli tracked the path of a comet. He took measurements of the comet and concluded that it was moving in an elliptical curved orbit around the sun. These conclusions went against the accepted scientific theory of the day (that was supported and imposed by the Catholic church), which asserted that Earth was the center of the universe. It was dangerous to oppose the theories of the church, so Borelli published his findings under the pseudonym Pier Maria Mutoli. In a treatise titled, &quot;Del Movimento della Cometa Apparasa il mese di Dicembre&quot; (Of the Movement of the Comet that Appears in the Month of December), Borelli suggested that planets &quot;and&quot; comets orbit the sun.     

Borelli returned to Messina in 1668 in the midst of a political uprising that was growing against the Spanish in Italy. Borelli joined the anti-Spanish forces despite his familial ties to Spain through his father. He changed his surname from his father&#x27;s name to a variation of his mother&#x27;s name, likely to hide his ties to the Spanish.

In 1674 Borelli was exiled from Messina to Rome for suspected involvement in the political conspiracy to free Sicily from Spanish rule. Here he first became acquainted with ex-Queen Christina of Sweden who had been forced to give up her crown and exiled to Rome two decades prior as a punishment for converting to Catholicism. In 1672 he served as her personal physician and scientific consultant.

Borelli lived the rest of his years in poverty, teaching mathematics to the religious pupils of the Piarist House of San Pantaleo, not far from Piazza Navona, where he lived since September 1677. During the last years of his life, he worked on his most well-known publication &quot;De Motu Animalium&quot; (On the Movement of Animals), described as &quot;a rigidly mechanical, mathematical and physical analysis of various animal functions...[which] became the bible of the iatromathematical or iatromechanical school...&quot;. The book attempted to clarify the cause of muscle fatigue, explain the cause of organ secretion, and explain the concept of pain. Volume I was published in 1680, a few months after Borelli&#x27;s death. Volume II of the book was published in 1681. Both volumes were dedicated to Christina of Sweden who financed the publication of the book with the help of his Piarist benefactors.

Borelli died in Rome on December 31, 1679 of unknown causes. He was buried in the Church of San Pantaleo, adjacent to the convent of the Piarists Fathers, in the Parione neighborhood, where he had lived during the last two years of his life.

==Scientific achievements==

Borelli&#x27;s major scientific achievements are focused on his investigation into biomechanics. This work originated with his studies of animals. His publications, &quot;De Motu Animalium I&quot; and &quot;De Motu Animalium II&quot;, borrowing their title from the Aristotelian treatise, relate animals to machines and utilize mathematics to prove his theories. The first volume covers biomechanical and muscular action in humans and animals (how muscles move while living beings walk, run, swim, jump, and fly). The second volume discusses the physiology of human organs, namely the lungs and heart. In this volume he concluded that the heart contracted like other muscles, but unlike other muscles it was not attached to any limb. He noted that the purpose of cardiac contraction was to send blood throughout the body.   

The anatomists of the 17th century were the first to suggest the contractile movement of muscles. Borelli, however, first suggested that &#x27;muscles do not exercise vital movement otherwise than by contracting.&#x27; He was also the first to deny corpuscular influence on the movements of muscles. This was proven through his scientific experiments demonstrating that living muscles did not release corpuscles into the water when cut. Borelli also recognized that forward motion entailed the movement of a body&#x27;s center of gravity forward, which was then followed by the swinging of its limbs in order to maintain balance. His studies also extended beyond muscle and locomotion. In particular, he likened the action of the heart to that of a piston. For this to work properly he derived the idea that the arteries have to be elastic. For these discoveries, Borelli is labeled as the father of modern biomechanics, and the American Society of Biomechanics uses the Borelli Award as its highest honor for research in the area.

Along with his work on biomechanics, Borelli also had interests in physics, specifically the orbits of the planets. Borelli believed that the planets were revolving as a result of three forces. The first force involved the planets&#x27; desire to approach the sun. The second force dictated that the planets were propelled to the side by impulses from sunlight, which is corporeal. Finally, the third force impelled the planets outward due to the sun&#x27;s revolution. The result of these forces is similar to a stone&#x27;s orbit when tied on a string. Borelli&#x27;s measurements of the orbits of satellites of Jupiter are mentioned in Volume 3 of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;.
Borelli is also considered to be the first person to consider a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus along with his early submarine design. The exhaled gas was cooled by sea water after passing through copper tubing. The helmet was brass with a glass window and 0.6 m (2 ft) in diameter. The apparatus was never likely to be used or tested. He discovered the principle of the heliostat more than sixty years before Willem &#x27;s Gravesande.

<doc id="475101" wikidata="Q243201" url="?curid=475101" title="Grigory Potemkin">
<text>Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tauricheski () was a Russian military leader, statesman, nobleman, and favourite of Catherine the Great. He died during negotiations over the Treaty of Jassy, which ended a war with the Ottoman Empire that he had overseen.

Potemkin was born into a family of middle-income landowners of Russian nobility. He first attracted Catherine&#x27;s favor for helping in her 1762 coup, then distinguished himself as a military commander in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). He became Catherine&#x27;s lover, favorite and possibly her consort. After their passion cooled, he remained her lifelong friend and favored statesman. Catherine obtained for him the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and gave him the title of Prince of the Russian Empire among many others: he was both a Grand Admiral and the head of all of Russia&#x27;s land and irregular forces. Potemkin&#x27;s achievements include the peaceful annexation of the Crimea (1783) and the successful second Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), during which the armed forces under his command besieged Ochakov.

In 1775, Potemkin became the governor-general of Russia&#x27;s new southern provinces. An absolute ruler, he worked to colonize the wild steppes, controversially dealing firmly with the Cossacks who lived there. He founded the towns of Kherson, Nikolayev, Sevastopol, and Yekaterinoslav. Ports in the region became bases for his new Black Sea Fleet.

His rule in the south is associated with the (probably mythical) &quot;Potemkin village&quot;, a ruse involving the construction of painted façades to mimic real villages, full of happy, well-fed people, for visiting officials to see. Potemkin was known for his love of women, gambling and material wealth. He oversaw the construction of many historically significant buildings, including the Tauride Palace in Saint Petersburg.

==Biography==

===Early life===
A distant relative of the Muscovite diplomat Pyotr Potemkin (1617–1700), Grigory was born in the village of Chizhovo near Smolensk into a family of middle-income noble landowners.
His father, Alexander Potemkin (1673–1746), was a decorated war veteran. His mother Daria Vasilievna Kondyreva (1704–1780) was &quot;good-looking, capable and intelligent&quot;, though their marriage proved ultimately unhappy. Potemkin received his first name in honour of his father&#x27;s cousin Grigory Matveevich Kizlovsky, a civil servant who became his godfather. Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore has suggested that Kizlovsky fathered Potemkin, who became the centre of attention, heir to the village and the only son among six children. As the son of an (albeit petty) noble family, he grew up with the expectation that he would serve the Russian Empire.

After Alexander died in 1746, Daria took charge of the family. In order to achieve a career for her son, and aided by Kizlovsky, the family moved to Moscow, where Potemkin enrolled at a gymnasium school attached to the University of Moscow. The young Potemkin became adept at languages and interested in the Russian Orthodox Church. He enlisted in the army in 1750 at age eleven, in accordance with the custom of noble children. In 1755 a second inspection placed him in the élite Horse Guards regiment.

Having graduated from the university school, Potemkin became one of the first students to enroll at the university itself. Talented in both Greek and theology, he won the university&#x27;s gold medal in 1757 and became part of a twelve-student delegation sent to Saint Petersburg later that year. The trip seems to have affected Potemkin: afterwards he studied little and was soon expelled. Faced with isolation from his family, he rejoined the Guards, where he excelled. At this time his net worth amounted to 430 souls (serfs), equivalent to that of the poorer gentry. His time was taken up with &quot;drinking, gambling, and promiscuous lovemaking&quot;, and he fell deep in debt.

Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine&#x27;s lovers, led a palace coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin represented his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops in front of the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin&#x27;s horse then appeared to refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and the horse returned to the ranks.

After the coup, Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter&#x27;s murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to &quot;Kammerjunker&quot; (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of her was well received.

===Courtier and general===
Although Catherine had not yet taken Potemkin as a lover, it seems likely that she passively—if not actively—encouraged his flirtatious behaviour, including his regular practice of kissing her hand and declaring his love for her: without encouragement, Potemkin could have expected trouble from the Orlovs (Catherine&#x27;s lover Grigory and his four brothers) who dominated court. Potemkin entered Catherine&#x27;s circle of advisers, and in 1762 took his only foreign assignment, to Sweden, bearing news of the coup. On his return, he was appointed Procurator, and won a reputation as a lover. Under unclear circumstances, Potemkin then lost his left eye and fell into a depression. According to legend, Grigory and Alexei Orlov invited Potemkin to a friendly game of billiards, then attacked him with their cues &quot;for flirting with Catherine&quot;, resulting in Potemkin&#x27;s eye being damaged during the brawl; the wound then turned septic &quot;after being mistreated by a quack physician&quot;. Other sources claim that Potemkin&#x27;s eye was struck by a ball &quot;during a tennis match&quot;. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, the cause of the damage was most likely just &quot;an infection.&quot; His confidence shattered, Potemkin withdrew from court, becoming something of a hermit.

Eighteen months later, Potemkin reappeared, probably summoned by Catherine. Upon his return, &quot;the man once known as Alcibiades for his wit and beauty was re-nicknamed &#x27;Cyclops&#x27;.&quot; He became an army paymaster and oversaw uniform production. Shortly thereafter, he became a Guardian of Exotic Peoples at the new All-Russian Legislative Commission, a significant political post. In September 1768, Potemkin became &quot;Kammerherr&quot; (chamberlain). Two months later Catherine had his military commission revoked, fully attaching him to court. In the interval, the Ottoman Empire had started the Russo-Turkish War of 1768 to 1774 and Potemkin was eager to prove himself, writing to Catherine:
Potemkin served as Major-General of the cavalry. He distinguished himself in his first engagement, helping to repulse a band of unruly Tatar and Turkish horsemen. He fought in Russia&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Kamenets and the taking of the town. Potemkin saw action virtually every day, particularly excelling at the Battle of Prashkovsky, after which his commander Aleksandr Mikhailovich Golitsyn recommended him to Catherine. Potemkin&#x27;s army, under Pyotr Rumyantsev, continued its advance. Potemkin fought at the capture of Jurja, a display of courage and skill for which he received the Order of St. Anna. At the Battle of Larga, he won the Order of St. George, third class, and fought well during the rout of the main Turkish force that followed. On leave to St. Petersburg, the Empress invited him to dine with her more than ten times.

Back at the front, Potemkin won more military acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After a lull in hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, but it seems that he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine&#x27;s closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen&#x27;s lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria, participating in the siege of the city. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.

===Favorite of Catherine II===

Potemkin returned to court in January 1774 expecting to walk into Catherine&#x27;s arms. The political situation, however, had become complex. Yemelyan Pugachev had just arisen as a pretender to the throne, and commanded a rebel army thirty thousand strong. In addition, Catherine&#x27;s son Paul turned eighteen and began to gain his own support. By late January Potemkin had tired of the impasse and effected (perhaps with encouragement from Catherine) a &quot;melodramatic retreat&quot; into the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. Catherine relented and had Potemkin brought back in early February 1774, when their relationship became intimate.

Several weeks later he had usurped Vasilchikov as Catherine&#x27;s favorite, and was given the title of Adjutant General. When Catherine&#x27;s friend Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm objected to Vasilchikov&#x27;s dismissal, she wrote back to him, &quot;Why do you reproach me because I dismiss a well-meaning but extremely boring bourgeois in favour of one of the greatest, the most comical and amusing, characters of this iron century?&quot; His uncouth behavior shocked the court, but Potemkin showed himself capable of suitable formality when necessary.

The frequent letters the pair sent to each other survive, revealing their affair to be one of &quot;laughter, sex, mutually admired intelligence, and power&quot;. Many of their trysts seem to have centered around the &quot;banya&quot; sauna in the basement of the Winter Palace; Potemkin soon grew so jealous that Catherine had to detail her prior love-life for him. Potemkin also rose in political stature, particularly on the strength of his military advice. In March 1774 he became Lieutenant-Colonel in the Preobrazhensky Guards, a post previously held by Alexei Orlov. He also became captain of the Chevaliers-Gardes from 1784.

In quick succession he won appointment as Governor-General of Novorossiya, as a member of the State Council, as General-in-Chief, as vice-president of the College of War and as Commander-in-Chief of the Cossacks. These posts made him rich, and he lived lavishly. To improve his social standing he was awarded the prestigious Order of St. Alexander Nevsky and Order of St. Andrew, along with the Polish Order of the White Eagle, the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle, the Danish Order of the Elephant and the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim.

That Catherine and Potemkin married is &quot;almost certain&quot;, according to Simon Sebag Montefiore, although biographer Virginia Rounding has expressed some doubts. In December 1784 Catherine first explicitly referred to Potemkin as her husband in correspondence, though 1775, 1784 and 1791 have all been suggested as possible nuptial dates. In all, Catherine&#x27;s phrasing in 22 letters suggested he had become her consort, at least secretly. Potemkin&#x27;s actions and her treatment of him later in life fit with this: the two at least acted as husband and wife.

By late 1775, their relationship was changing, though it is uncertain exactly when Catherine took a secretary, Pyotr Zavadovsky, as a lover. On 2 January 1776, Zavadovsky became Adjutant-General to the Empress (he became her official favorite in May) and Potemkin moved to command the St. Petersburg troop division. Signs of a potential &quot;golden adieu&quot; for Potemkin include his 1776 appointment, at Catherine&#x27;s request, to the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

Though he was &quot;bored&quot; with Catherine, the separation was relatively peaceful. The Prince was sent on a tour to Novgorod, but, contrary to the expectations of some onlookers (though not Catherine&#x27;s), he returned a few weeks later. He then snubbed her gift of the Anichkov Palace, and took new apartments in the Winter Palace, retaining his posts. Though no longer Catherine&#x27;s favorite, he remained her favored minister.

Though the love affair appeared to end, Catherine and Potemkin maintained a particularly close friendship, which continued to dominate their lives. Most of the time this meant a love triangle in the court between the pair and Catherine&#x27;s latest swain. The favorite had a high-pressure position: after Zavadovsky came Semyon Zorich (May 1777 to May 1778), Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov (May 1778 to late 1778), Alexander Lanskoy (1780–1784), Alexander Yermolov (1785–1786), Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov (1786–1789) and Platon Zubov (1789–1796). Potemkin checked candidates for their suitability; it also appears that he tended to the relationships and &quot;filled in&quot; between favorites. Potemkin also arranged for Catherine to walk in on Rimsky-Korsakov in a compromising position with another woman. During Catherine&#x27;s (comparatively) long relationship with Lanskoy, Potemkin was particularly able to turn his attentions to other matters. He embarked upon a long series of other romances, including with his own nieces, one of whom may have borne him a child.

===Diplomat===
Potemkin&#x27;s first task during this period was foreign policy. An Anglophile, he helped negotiate with the English ambassador, Sir James Harris, during Catherine&#x27;s initiative of Armed Neutrality, though the south remained his passion. His plan, known as the &quot;Greek Project&quot;, aspired to build a new Byzantine Empire around the Turkish capital in Constantinople. Dismembering the Ottoman Empire would require détente with Austria (technically still the Habsburg monarchy), and its ruler Joseph II. They met in May 1780 in the Russian town of Mogilev. The ensuing alliance represented the triumph of Potemkin&#x27;s approach over courtiers such as Catherine&#x27;s son Paul, who favored alliance with Prussia. The May 1781 defensive treaty remained secret for almost two years; the Ottomans were said to still have been unaware of it even when they declared war on Russia in 1787.
Elsewhere, Potemkin&#x27;s scheme to develop a Russian presence in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a small unit sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia&#x27;s southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy.

By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing on the fact that Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia&#x27;s aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially looked as though it might also, but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.

===Governor-General and city builder===
Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg in November 1783 and was promoted to Field Marshal when Crimea was formally annexed the following February. He also became President of the College of War. The province of Taurida (Crimea) was added to the state of Novorossiya (lit. &quot;New Russia&quot;). Potemkin moved south in mid-March, as the &quot;Prince of Taurida&quot; or &quot;Potemkin-Tauricheski&quot;. He had been the &quot;namestnik&quot; of Russia&#x27;s southern provinces (including Novorossiya, Azov, Saratov, Astrakhan and the Caucasus) since 1774, repeatedly expanding the domain via military action. He kept his own court, which rivalled Catherine&#x27;s: by the 1780s he operated a chancellery with fifty or more clerks and had his own minister, Vasili Popov, to oversee day-to-day affairs. Another favored associate was Mikhail Faleev.

The &quot;criminal&quot; breaking of the Cossack hosts, particularly the Zaporozhian Cossacks in 1775, helped define his rule. However, Montefiore argues that given their location, and in the wake of the Pugachev rebellion, the Cossacks were likely doomed in any case. By the time of Potemkin&#x27;s death, the Cossacks and their threat of anarchic revolt were well controlled. Among the Zaporizhian Cossacks he was known as &quot;Hrytsko Nechesa&quot;.

====Builder====

Potemkin then embarked on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, as a base for a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was his effort to build the city of Yekaterinoslav (), now the city of Dnipro. The second most successful city of Potemkin&#x27;s rule was Nikolayev (now Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was to turn out to be his greatest city planning triumph.

Potemkin&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet was a massive undertaking for its time. By 1787, the British ambassador reported twenty-seven ships of the line. It put Russia on a naval footing with Spain, though far behind the Royal Navy. The period represented the peak of Russia&#x27;s naval power relative to other European states. Potemkin also rewarded hundreds of thousands of settlers who moved into his territories. It is estimated that by 1782 the populations of Novorossiya and Azov had doubled during a period of &quot;exceptionally rapid&quot; development. Immigrants included Russians, foreigners, British convicts diverted from Australia, Cossacks and controversially Jews. Though the immigrants were not always happy in their new surroundings, on at least one occasion Potemkin intervened directly to ensure families received the cattle to which they were entitled. Outside of Novorossiya he drew up the Azov-Mozdok defense line, constructing forts at Georgievsk, Stavropol and elsewhere and ensured that the whole of the line was settled.

In 1784 Alexander Lanskoy died and Potemkin was needed at court to console the grieving Catherine. After Alexander Yermolov was installed as the new favorite in 1785, Catherine, Yermolov and Potemkin cruised the upper Volga. When Yermolov attempted to unseat Potemkin (and attracted support from Potemkin&#x27;s critics), he found himself replaced by Count Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov in the summer of 1786. Potemkin returned to the south, having arranged that Catherine would visit in the summer of 1787. She reached Kiev in late January, to travel down the Dnieper after the ice had melted (see Crimean journey of Catherine the Great). Potemkin had other lovers at this time, including a &#x27;Countess&#x27; and a Naryshkina. Leaving in April, the royal party arrived in Kherson a month later. On visiting Sevastopol, Austria&#x27;s Joseph II, who was traveling with them, was moved to note that &quot;The Empress is totally ecstatic... Prince Potemkin is at the moment all-powerful&quot;.

====&quot;Potemkin village&quot;====
The notion of the Potemkin village, coined in German by critical biographer Georg von Helbig as &quot;&quot;, arose from Catherine&#x27;s visit to the south. Critics accused Potemkin of using painted façades to fool Catherine into thinking that the area was far richer than it was. Thousands of peasants were alleged to have been stage-managed for this purpose. Certainly, Potemkin had arranged for Catherine to see the best he had to offer, organizing numerous exotic excursions, and at least two cities&#x27; officials concealed poverty by building false houses. It seems unlikely that the fraud approached the scale alleged. The Prince of Ligne, a member of the Austrian delegation, who had explored on his own during the trip, later proclaimed the allegations to be false.

===Commander-in-Chief===
Potemkin remained in the south, gradually sinking into depression. His inactivity was problematic, given that he was now Russia&#x27;s commander-in-chief and, in August 1787, another Russo-Turkish war broke out, the second of Potemkin&#x27;s lifetime. His opponents were anxious to reclaim the lands they had lost in the last war, and they were under pressure from Prussia, Britain and Sweden to take a hostile attitude towards Russia. Potemkin&#x27;s bluster had probably contributed to the hostility, either deliberately or accidentally. Either way, his creation of the new fleet and Catherine&#x27;s trip to the south had certainly not helped matters. In the center, Potemkin had his own Yekaterinoslav Army, while to the west lay the smaller Ukraine Army under the command of Field-Marshal Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky. On water he had the Black Sea Fleet, and Potemkin was also responsible for coordinating military actions with Russia&#x27;s Austrian allies.

Potemkin and Catherine agreed on a primarily defensive strategy until the spring. Though the Turks were repelled in early skirmishes against the Russian fortress at Kinburn, news of the loss of Potemkin&#x27;s beloved fleet during a storm sent him into a deep depression. A week later, and after kind words from Catherine, he was rallied by the news that the fleet was not destroyed, but only damaged. General Alexander Suvorov won an important victory at Kinburn in early October. With winter now approaching, Potemkin was confident the port would be safe until the spring.

Turning his attention elsewhere, Potemkin established his headquarters in Elisabethgrad and planned future operations. He assembled an army of forty or fifty thousand, including the newly formed Kuban Cossacks. He divided his time between military preparation (creating a fleet of a hundred gunboats to fight within the shallow liman) and chasing the wives of soldiers under his command. Meanwhile, the Austrians remained on the defensive across central Europe, though they did manage to hold their lines. Despite advice to the contrary, Potemkin pursued an equally defensive strategy, though in the Caucasus Generals Tekeeli and Pavel Potemkin were making some inroads.

In early summer 1788, fighting intensified as Potemkin&#x27;s forces won their naval confrontation with the Turks with few losses, and began the siege of Ochakov, a Turkish stronghold and the main Russian war aim. Less promising was that St. Petersburg, exposed after Russia&#x27;s best forces departed for Crimea, was now under threat from Sweden in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. Potemkin refused to write regularly with news of the war in the south, compounding Catherine&#x27;s anxiety.
Potemkin argued with Suvorov and Catherine herself, who were both anxious to assault Ochakov, which the Turks twice managed to supply by sea. Finally, on 6 December, the assault began and four hours later the city was taken, a coup for Potemkin. Nearly ten thousand Turks had been killed at a cost of (only) two-and-a-half thousand Russians. Catherine wrote that &quot;you [Potemkin] have shut the mouths of everyone... [and can now] show magnanimity to your blind and empty-headed critics&quot;.

Potemkin then visited the naval yard at Vitovka, founded Nikolayev, and traveled on to St. Petersburg, arriving in February 1789. In May he left once more for the front, having agreed on contingency plans with Catherine should Russia be forced into war with either Prussia or the upstart Poland, which had recently successfully demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory. (Catherine herself was just about to change favorites for the final time, replacing Dmitriev-Mamonov with Platon Zubov.) Back on the Turkish front, Potemkin advanced towards the fortress of Bender on the Dniester river.

The summer and autumn of 1789 saw numerous victories against the Turks, including the Battle of Focşani in July; in early September, the Battle of Rymnik and the capture of both Kaushany and Hadjibey (modern-day Odesa); and finally the surrender of the Turkish fortress at Akkerman in late September. The massive fortress at Bender surrendered in November without a fight. Potemkin opened up a lavish court at Iași, the capital of Moldavia, to &quot;winter like a sultan, revel in his mistresses, build his towns, create his regiments—and negotiate peace with [the Turks]... he was emperor of all he surveyed&quot;. Potemkin even established a newspaper, &quot;Le Courrier de Moldavie&quot;. His preferred lover at the time—though he had others—was Praskovia Potemkina, an affair which continued into 1790. Potemkin renamed two ships in her honor. As part of the diplomatic machinations, Potemkin was given the new title of &quot;Grand Hetman of the Black Sea and Yekaterinoslav Cossack Hosts&quot; and in March he assumed personal control of the Black Sea fleet as Grand Admiral.
In July 1790, the Russian Baltic Fleet was defeated by the Swedish at the Battle of Svensksund. Despite the damage, the silver lining for the Russians was that the Swedes now felt able to negotiate on an even footing and a peace was soon signed (Treaty of Värälä on 14 August 1790) based on the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, thus ending the threat of invasion. The peace also freed up military resources for the war against the Turks. Potemkin had moved his ever more lavish court to Bender and there were soon more successes against Turkey, including the capture of Batal-Pasha and, on the second attempt, of Kiliya on the Danube. By the end of November, only one major target remained: the Turkish fortress of Izmail. At Potemkin&#x27;s request, General Suvorov commanded the assault, which proved to be costly but effective. The victory was commemorated by Russia&#x27;s first, albeit unofficial, national anthem, &quot;Let the thunder of victory sound!&quot;, written by Gavrila Derzhavin and Osip Kozlovsky.

After two years, he returned to St. Petersburg to face the threat of war against an Anglo-Prussian coalition in addition to the war with Turkey. His return was widely celebrated with the &quot;Carnival of Prince Potemkin&quot;. The Prince came across as polite and charming though his latest mistress, Princess Ekaterina Dolgorukaya, appeared sidelined, and Potemkin found himself embroiled in court intrigue whilst trying to force Zubov out. Catherine and Potemkin fought over military strategy; the Empress wanted no compromise, while Potemkin wanted to buy time by appeasing the Prussians.

Fortunately for the Russians, the Anglo-Prussian alliance collapsed and a British ultimatum that Russia should accept the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; was withdrawn. In this way, the threat of a wider war receded. Though Russia was still at war with the Ottomans, Potemkin&#x27;s focus was now Poland. Potemkin had conservative allies including Felix Potocki, whose schemes were so diverse that they have yet to be fully untangled. For example, one idea was for Potemkin to declare himself king.

Success on the Turkish front continued, mostly attributable to Potemkin. He now had the opportunity to confront the Turks and dictate a peace, but that would mean leaving Catherine. His procrastination soured Catherine&#x27;s attitude towards him, a situation compounded by Potemkin&#x27;s choice of the married Princess Paskovia Adreevna Golitsyna (née Shuvalova) as his latest mistress. In the end, Potemkin was given the requisite authority to negotiate with the Turks (and, afterwards, to pursue his Polish ambitions), and dispatched by Catherine back to the south. She sent a note after him, reading &quot;Goodbye my friend, I kiss you&quot;.

===Death===
Potemkin fell ill in the fever-ridden city of Iași, then often known as Jassy in English, although he kept busy, overseeing peace talks, planning his assault on Poland, and preparing the army for renewed war in the south. He fasted briefly and recovered some strength, but refused medicine and began to feast once again, consuming a &quot;ham, a salted goose and three or four chickens&quot;. On , he felt better and dictated a letter to Catherine before collapsing once more. Later, he awoke and dispatched his entourage to Nikolayev. On Potemkin died in the open steppe, 60 km from Iași. Picking up on contemporary rumor, historians such as the Polish Jerzy Łojek have suggested that he was poisoned because his madness made him a liability, but this is rejected by Montefiore, who suggests he succumbed to bronchial pneumonia instead.

Potemkin was embalmed, and a funeral was held for him in Iași. Eight days after his death, he was buried. Catherine was distraught and ordered social life in St. Petersburg be put on hold. Derzhavin&#x27;s ode &quot;Waterfall&quot; lamented Potemkin&#x27;s death. Likewise many in the military establishment had looked upon Potemkin as a father figure and were especially saddened by his demise. Polish contemporary Stanisław Małachowski claimed that Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a niece of Potemkin&#x27;s and the wife of Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, a magnate and prominent leader of the Targowica Confederation, worried for the fate of Poland after the death of the man who had planned to revitalise the Polish state with himself as its new head.

Potemkin had used the state treasury as a personal bank, preventing the resolution of his financial affairs to this day. Catherine purchased the Tauride Palace and his art collection from his estate, and paid off his debts. Consequently, he left a relative fortune.

Catherine&#x27;s son Paul, who succeeded to the throne in 1796, attempted to undo as many of Potemkin&#x27;s reforms as possible. The Tauride Palace was turned into a barracks, and the city of Gregoripol, which had been named in Potemkin&#x27;s honor, was renamed.

Potemkin&#x27;s grave survived a destruction order issued by Paul and was eventually displayed by the Bolsheviks. His remains appeared to lie in his tomb at St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral in Kherson. The exact whereabouts of some of his internal organs, including his heart and brain first kept at Golia Monastery in Iași, remain unknown. Pro-Russian officials during the Russian invasion of Ukraine said that his remains were taken from his tomb and transported to Russia. This was the ninth time that Potemkin&#x27;s remains were moved.

==Personality and reputation==
Potemkin &quot;exuded both menace and welcome&quot;; he was arrogant, demanding of his courtiers, and very changeable in his moods, but also fascinating, warm, and kind. It was generally agreed among his female companions that he was &quot;amply endowed with &#x27;sex appeal&#x27;&quot;.

Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur described him as &quot;colossal like Russia&quot;, &quot;an inconceivable mixture of grandeur and pettiness, laziness and activity, bravery and timidity, ambition and insouciance&quot;. The internal contrast was evident throughout his life: he frequented both church and numerous orgies, for example. In Ségur&#x27;s view, onlookers had a tendency to unjustly attribute to Catherine alone the successes of the period and to Potemkin the failures. An eccentric workaholic, Potemkin was vain and a great lover of jewelry (a taste he did not always remember to pay for), but he disliked sycophancy and was sensitive about his appearance, particularly his lost eye. He only agreed to have portraits made of him twice, in 1784 and again in 1791, both times by Johann Baptist von Lampi and from an angle which disguised his injury. Potemkin was often noted for his uncouth behavior, most notably his unscrupulous sexual liaisons and biting his nails. Potemkin&#x27;s nail-biting was so persistent that it was frequently noticed by courtiers and guests, and resulted in hangnail.

It is possible that Potemkin was affected by bipolar disorder. His highs and lows, his inability to follow through on his ideas, his material and sexual excesses, his impulsive whims, his energy and lethargy, and his depressive spells suggest some kind of bipolar disorder. In a time that was not aware of mental illness, Potemkin, and, it must be said, the people in his life such as Catherine, suffered from this lack of understanding.

Potemkin was an intellectual. The Prince of Ligne noted that Potemkin had &quot;natural abilities [and] an excellent memory&quot;. He was interested in history, generally knowledgeable, and loved the classical music of the period, as well as opera. He liked all food, both peasant and fine, his favorites included roast beef and potatoes, and his anglophilia meant that English gardens were prepared wherever he went. A practical politician, his political ideas were &quot;quintessentially Russian&quot;, and he believed in the superiority of the Tsarist autocracy. He once described the French revolutionaries as &quot;a pack of madmen&quot;.
One evening, at the height of his power, Potemkin declared to his dinner guests:
Ultimately, Potemkin proved a controversial figure. Criticisms include &quot;laziness, corruption, debauchery, indecision, extravagance, falsification, military incompetence, and disinformation on a vast scale&quot;, but supporters hold that &quot;the sybaritism [devotion to luxury] and extravagance... are truly justified&quot;, stressing Potemkin&#x27;s &quot;intelligence, force of personality, spectacular vision, courage, generosity and great achievements&quot;. Although not a military genius, he was &quot;seriously able&quot; in military matters. Potemkin&#x27;s contemporary Ségur was quick to criticise, writing that &quot;nobody thought out a plan more swiftly [than Potemkin], carried it out more slowly and abandoned it more easily&quot;. Another contemporary, the Scotsman Sir John Sinclair, added that Potemkin had &quot;great abilities&quot; but was ultimately a &quot;worthless and dangerous character&quot;. Russian opponents such as Semyon Vorontsov agreed: the Prince had &quot;lots of intelligence, intrigue and credit&quot;, but lacked &quot;knowledge, application and virtue&quot;.

==Family==
Potemkin had no legitimate descendants, though it is probable he had illegitimate issue. Elizabeth Temkina was the once-alleged daughter of Catherine the Great and Grigory Potemkin. 

Four of his five sisters lived long enough to bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as &#x27;Helen&#x27;) received Potemkin&#x27;s special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, one of whom was twelve or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.

Potemkin also had influential relatives. Potemkin&#x27;s sister Maria, for example, married Russian senator Nikolay Samoylov: their son Alexander was decorated for his service under Potemkin in the army; their daughter Ekaterina married first into the Raevsky family, and then the wealthy landowner Lev Davydov. She had children with both husbands, including highly decorated General Nikolay Raevsky, Potemkin&#x27;s great-nephew. His wider family included several distant cousins, among them Count Pavel Potemkin, another decorated military figure, whose brother Mikhail married Potemkin&#x27;s niece Tatiana Engelhardt. A distant nephew, Felix Yusupov, helped murder Rasputin in 1916.

==Legacy==
Despite attempts by Paul I to play down Potemkin&#x27;s role in Russian history, his name found its way into numerous items of common parlance:
*A century after Potemkin&#x27;s death, the Battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; was named in his honour. The ship became famous for its involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequent dramatization in &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, a Soviet movie by Sergey Eisenstein, which at one point was named the greatest film of all time.
*The name of the giant seaside staircase in Odesa, featured in &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot;, eventually became known as the Potemkin Stairs.
* The phrase &quot;Potemkin village&quot; entered common usage in Russia and globally, despite its fictional origin.
* The Grigory Potemkin Republican Cadet Corps is a specialized institution in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Transnistria that is named after the Russian prince.

Its full name was &quot;Dà Sòng chóngxiū guǎngyùn&quot; (, literally &quot;Great Song revised and expanded rhymes&quot;). Chen Pengnian (, 961–1017) and Qiu Yong () were the chief editors.

The dictionary is a revision and expansion of the influential &quot;Qieyun&quot; rime dictionary of 601, and was itself later revised as the &quot;Jiyun&quot;. &quot;Pingshui Yun&quot; system, the standard for poetry rhyming after the Song Dynasty, is also based on &quot;Guangyun&quot;. Until the discovery of an almost complete early 8th century edition of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; in 1947, the &quot;Guangyun&quot; was the most accurate available account of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; phonology, and was heavily used in early work on the reconstruction of Middle Chinese. It is still used as a major source.

The &quot;Guangyun&quot; has a similar hierarchical organization to the &quot;Qieyun&quot;:
* The dictionary is split into four tones in five volumes, two for the Middle Chinese level tone () and one each for the three oblique tones, rising (), departing () and entering ().
* Each tone is split into rimes, with a total of 206 final rimes, increased from 193 in the &quot;Qieyun&quot;.
* Each rime is divided into groups of homophonous characters, with the pronunciation of each group given by a fanqie formula.
The dictionary has a total of 26,194 character entries, each containing a brief explanation of the character&#x27;s meaning.

The Unihan database incorporates the &quot;SBGY&quot; (&quot;Songben Guangyun&quot;; &quot;Song edition &quot;Guangyun&quot;&quot;) dataset with 25,334 head-entries for 19,583 characters.

<doc id="475108" wikidata="Q947208" url="?curid=475108" title="Pinot Meunier">
<text>Pinot Meunier (), also known as Meunier or Schwarzriesling (), is a variety of red wine grape most noted for being one of the three main varieties used in the production of Champagne (the other two are the red variety Pinot noir and the white Chardonnay). Until recently, producers in Champagne generally did not acknowledge Pinot Meunier, preferring to emphasise the use of the other noble varieties, but now Pinot Meunier is gaining recognition for the body and richness it contributes to Champagne. Pinot Meunier is approximately one-third of all the grapes planted in Champagne. It is a chimeric mutation of Pinot: its inner cell layers are composed of a Pinot genotype which is close to Pinot noir or Pinot gris; the outer, epidermal, layer is, however, made up of a mutant, distinctive, genotype. Pinot Meunier was first mentioned in the 16th century, and gets its name and synonyms (French &quot;Meunier&quot; and German &quot;Müller&quot;—both meaning miller) from flour-like dusty white down on the underside of its leaves.

==Ampelography==
Pinot Meunier can be identified by ampelographers by its indented leaves that appear downy white, like flour has been dusted liberally on the underside, and lightly on the upper side, of the leaf. The name &quot;Meunier&quot; comes from the French word for miller with many of the grapevine&#x27;s synonyms (see below) also hearkening to this association—such as &quot;Dusty Miller&quot; which is used in England, &quot;Farineaux&quot; and &quot;Noirin Enfariné&quot; used in France as well as &quot;Müllerrebe&quot; and &quot;Müller-Traube&quot; used in Germany. This characteristic derives from large numbers of fine white hairs on the leaves. However, some clones of Pinot Meunier have been found to be completely hairless—a chimeric mutation, in fact—which has led ampelographers to more closely draw a link between Meunier and Pinot noir.

In research, Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas of the CSIRO Plant Industry and Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture in Glen Osmond, Australia, found that Pinot Meunier has a mutation (&quot;VvGAI1&quot;) that stops it from responding to gibberellic acid, a plant growth hormone. This leads to different, white-haired, leaf and shoot growth, and also to a slight stunting in growth, explaining why Pinot Meunier plants tend to be a bit smaller than Pinot noir. The mutation exists only in the outermost cell layer of the cultivar, the L1 or &#x27;epidermal&#x27; layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera. Through tissue culture, it is thus possible to separate out plants containing both the mutant (L1) and non-mutant (L2) genotypes, yielding a normal Pinot noir -like genotype and an unusual looking L1-genotype vine with compressed internodes and thickly clustered leaves. The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that gibberellic acid converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.

==Wine regions==

Pinot Meunier is one of the most widely planted grapes in France but it is rather obscure to most wine drinkers and will rarely be seen on a wine label. The grape has been favored by vine growers in northern France due to its ability to bud and ripen more reliably than Pinot noir. The vine&#x27;s tendency to bud later in the growing season and ripen earlier makes it less susceptible to developing coulure which can greatly reduce a prospective crop. For the last couple of centuries, Pinot Meunier has been the most widely planted Champagne grape, accounting for more than 40% of the region&#x27;s entire plantings. It is most prevalent in the cooler, north facing vineyards of the &quot;Vallee de la Marne&quot; and in the Aisne department. It is also widely grown in the Aube region in vineyards where Pinot noir and Chardonnay would not fully ripen.

Compared to Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier produces lighter colored wines with slightly higher acid levels but can maintain similar sugar and alcohol levels. As part of a standard Champagne blend, Pinot Meunier contributes aromatics and fruity flavors to the wine. Champagnes with a substantial proportion of Pinot Meunier tend not to have as much significant aging potential as Champagnes that are composed primarily of Chardonnay or Pinot noir. It is therefore most commonly used for Champagnes that are intended to be consumed young, when the soft, plushy fruit of the Pinot Meunier is at its peak. A notable exception is the Champagne house of Krug which makes liberal use of Pinot Meunier in its long-lived &quot;prestige cuvee&quot;s.

During the 19th century, Pinot Meunier was widely planted throughout northern France, especially in the Paris Basin. It was found across the northern half of country from the Loire Valley to Lorraine. Today, Pinot Meunier is found outside of Champagne in dwindling quantities in the Loire Valley regions of Touraine and Orleans as well as the Cotes de Toul and Moselle regions. In these regions Pinot Meunier is used to make light bodied reds and rosés. These wines most often fall into the &quot;vin gris&quot; style are characterized by their pale pink color and distinctive smokey notes.

===Other regions===
In Germany, Pinot Meunier is used most often to make still red wines under its synonyms Schwarzriesling, Müllerrebe and Müller-Traube. The style of those wines ranges from simple, light, off-dry (&quot;halbtrocken&quot;) to rich, dry with substantial flavors. More recently, Schwarzriesling is used also to make dry white wines with a fresh, fruity character. Most German plantings of the variety ( out of , or 74%, in the year 2006) are found in Württemberg. Here it is used to make a local speciality known as &quot;Schillerwein&quot; which is characterized by its light pink color, smokey noted and slightly higher acidity than wines made from Spätburgunder (Pinot noir). Some growers in Württemberg have been promoting a particular clone of Pinot Meunier that has developed in the region known as &quot;Samtrot&quot;. Pinot Meunier is also found in significant quantities in the German wine regions of Baden, Franconia and Palatinate. Despite the variety&#x27;s connection with Champagne, it only recently become popular to use Schwarzriesling in the production of sparkling wines Sekt, often not blended with its Champagne partners but as pure brut Schwarzriesling &quot;Sekt&quot;. Pinot Meunier is also grown in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and in small quantities in Austria.

In California, American sparkling wine producers wishing to emulate the Champagne method began planting Pinot Meunier in the 1980s. Today most of the state&#x27;s plantings are located in the Carneros AVA. Bouchaine Vineyards, Mumm Napa and Domaine Chandon are a few wineries in all of the Napa Valley to produce a still Pinot Meunier. In Australia, the grape has had a longer history in Australian wine production than Pinot noir. In the Grampians region of Victoria, Pinot Meunier was known at one time as &quot;Miller&#x27;s Burgundy&quot; and used to make still red varietal wine. In the late 20th century plantings were starting to decline until a revival of Champagne-style sparkling wine took hold in the 2000s which sparked renewed interest in Pinot Meunier. The New Zealand wine industry has recently discovered Pinot Meunier for both still &amp; sparkling wine production. As a varietal red wine, Pinot Meunier tends to produce slightly jammy, fruity wines with moderate acidity and low tannins.

==Possible relationships==
Ferdinand Regner has proposed that Pinot Meunier (Schwarzriesling) is a parent of Pinot noir but this work has not been replicated and would appear to be superseded by the Australian work.

The Wrotham (pronounced &quot;rootum&quot;) Pinot is an English selection of Pinot that is sometimes regarded as a synonym of Pinot Meunier. The Wrotham Pinot does look somewhat similar to Meunier, with white hairs on the upper surface of the leaves. But it is particularly resistant to disease, has a higher natural sugar content and ripens two weeks earlier than Meunier. No genetic evidence exists however to prove it is anything other than a distinctively named clone of Pinot Meunier.

==Synonyms==
Pinot Meunier is known under various synonyms across the globe including-Auvernat Meunier, Blanc Meunier, Blanche Feuille, Carpinet, Cerny Mancujk, Créedinet, Dusty Miller, Farineux noir, Fernaise, Frésillon, Fromenté, Frühe blaue Müllerrebe, Goujeau, Gris Meunier, Meunier, Meunier Gris, Miller Grape, Miller&#x27;s Burgundy, Molnár Töke, Molnár Töke Kék, Molnárszölö, Morillon Tacone, Morone Farinaccio, Moucnik, Müllerrebe, Muller-Traube, Noirin Enfariné, Noirien de Vuillapans, Pineau Meunier, Pino Meine, Pinot negro, Plant de Brie, Plant Meunier, Plant Munier, Postitschtraube, Rana Modra Mlinaria, Rana Modra Mlinarica, Resseau, Riesling noir, Sarpinet, Trézillon and Wrotham Pinot.

<text>Temple Street is a street located in the areas of Jordan and Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon, Hong Kong. It is known for its night market and is one of the busiest flea markets at night in the territory. The night market lies in the Yau Ma Tei, Jordan part of the street. Popular with tourists and locals alike in the evening, it is also common to see the place crowded at dusk. It sells cheap merchandise and food items. The place is sometimes known as &quot;Men&#x27;s Street&quot;.

==History==
The road was built during the Qing dynasty and was named after the Tin Hau temple which was built on the site.

==Temple Street Night Market==


The Temple Street Night Market is sometimes known as Men&#x27;s Street as it is popular for men&#x27;s fashion. The market starts at 2 p.m., but is lively at dusk daily. Traffic is closed on the street at that time as visitors swarm into the street. There are more than a hundred stalls with colourful lights in the market. There are carts bulging with goods from clothing to mobile phones and watches. Stalls have items mainly for men, jeans, t-shirts, pants, lighters, shoes and men&#x27;s accessories. Low-priced merchandise is common in the night market. Cheap second hand goods such as cassettes, video tapes, old newspapers, antiques are also sold there. Like in other night markets in Southeast Asia, prices can always be negotiated by bargaining.

==Attractions==
Tourists can do shopping and enjoy a Cantonese opera show.

==Clinics==
Old Chinese clinics exist on this street which employ Traditional Chinese medicine for treating illnesses and diseases. They are known as TCM physicians (dubbed the &quot;Masters&quot;) and many have run these clinics for many years.

==Food and beverage==
The night market is famous for its snacks and roadside dining, which serves local street cuisine. It sells a wide range of delicious local delicacies.

There are also many restaurants selling seafood. These rice hot pots can be perfect for an intimate dinner. They are delicious as well as affordable. All of these culinary delicacies represent Hong Kong&#x27;s traditional and unique food culture.

==Temple Street Festival==
During September 2003, the inaugural Temple Street Festival was organised and was supported by the Home Affairs Bureau and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

==Transport==
The nearest MTR stations to Temple Street are Jordan station Exit A in ten minutes and Yau Ma Tei station Exit C one minute.

==In popular culture==
The unique characteristics of Temple Street make it a desirable location for filming. It is often used as a setting to portray all walks of life in Hong Kong. Also, many gangster films depict the place as a street of crime. The place is featured in films such as &quot;Queen of Temple Street&quot; (1990), &quot;The Prince of Temple Street&quot; (1992) and Mean Street Story (廟街故事, 1995).

Temple Street also plays a prominent role in the Stephen Chow film &quot;The God of Cookery&quot;, the Fiona Sit series &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie, Mon Chéri&quot;, and the TVB series &quot;Street Fighters&quot; (廟街·媽·兄弟) which starred Hacken Lee and Edmond Leung.

<text>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, is a multinational conglomerate, based in Hong Kong. It was one of Hong Kong&#x27;s leading multi-national conglomerates. The company merged with its subsidiary Hutchison Whampoa on 3 June 2015, as part of a major reorganisation, to become part of CK Hutchison Holdings.

The Chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings was Li Ka-shing, while his elder son, Victor Li, was managing director and deputy chairman. Li Ka-shing founded Cheung Kong Industries in the 1950s as a plastics manufacturer. Eventually the company evolved into a property investment company. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited was established in 1971.

The Cheung Kong Group are developers of residential, office, retail, industrial and hotel properties in Hong Kong. With its history of property development and residential estates, as part of the reorganisation of the group a new company composed of the group&#x27;s property assets was spun-off in June 2015 as Cheung Kong Property Holdings.

==Component companies==

The market capitalisation of the Cheung Kong Group&#x27;s Hong Kong-listed companies amounted to HK$1,148 billion on 31 January 2015. The group operates in over 50 countries and employs over 240,000 staff worldwide.

The group had nine companies:
*Hutchison Whampoa Limited ()
*Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited ()
*Power Assets Holdings Limited ()
*CK Life Sciences Int&#x27;l., (Holdings) Inc. ()
*Hutchison Asia Telecommunications Limited
*TOM Group Limited ()
The company was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972 as Cheung Kong Holdings, and developed into a property development and strategic investment company, with interests in life sciences and other businesses.

The company and Sun Hung Kai Properties together became increasingly dominant in the development of new private homes, accounting for 70% of the market in 2010, up from around half of that in 2003. This concentration, with much of the rest of the market occupied by other very large firms, is attributed to the government&#x27;s policy of auctioning land in expensive large blocks, squeezing out small and mid-sized firms, according to the Consumer Council.

===Restructuring===
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing confirmed the business would be restructured and its property business spun-off as a separately listed company, Cheung Kong Property. Under the plans, Cheung Kong Holdings purchased the shares in Hutchison Whampoa that it did not already own, and merged the companies under a new single holding company, CK Hutchison Holdings. The new holding company was established on 18 March 2015, based in the Cayman Islands, but listed in Hong Kong.

Hutchison Whampoa was delisted on 3 June 2015, on the same day that a new company comprising the group&#x27;s existing property assets, Cheung Kong Property Holdings, began trading.

==Shareholdings==

===Telecommunications===

The company operates mobile telephone services under the 3 brand in 10 countries, inherited from Hutchison Whampoa.

CK Hutchison&#x27;s telecommunications subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Australia are listed companies; the company holds 66.09% and 87.87% stakes in these respectively.

===Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd===

The chairman of Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited (CKI) is Victor Li Tzar-kuoi. CKI is the largest diversified infrastructure company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It is a Hong Kong-based diversified infrastructure company, focused on the development, investment and operation of infrastructure businesses in countries such as China, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

CK Hutchison holds a 75.67% stake in the company.

===Power Assets Holdings Limited===

The chairman of Power Assets Holdings Limited is Canning Fok Kin-ning. The listed Hongkong Electric group of companies are
*The Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HEC),
*Hongkong Electric International Limited (HEI),
*Associated Technical Services Limited (ATS); and
*some minor subsidiaries.
The Hongkong Electric Company Limited mainly concentrates on the generation and supply of electricity on Hong Kong Island and Lamma Island. Hongkong Electric International Limited pursues overseas investment opportunities and Associated Technical Services Limited&#x27;s principal activity is engineering consultancy and project management.

CK Hutchison holds a 38.87% stake in the company.

===CK Life Sciences Int&#x27;l., (Holdings) Inc.===

CK Life Sciences is engaged in the business of research and development, commercialisation, marketing and sale of biotechnology products. Products developed by CK Life Sciences are categorised into two areas, human health and environmental sustainability.

CK Hutchison holds a 45.32% stake in the company.

==Other investments==
Apart from the core business of property development, CK Hutchison&#x27;s ventures include TOM Group Limited. Ltd, Corporation Limited, CK Communications Ltd, Excel Technology International Holdings Ltd, Corporation (HK) Ltd and Beijing Net-Infinity Technology Development Co., Ltd.

Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s 34% stake in the Canadian energy company Husky Energy passed to CK Hutchison on completion of the merger.

<doc id="475133" wikidata="Q319749" url="?curid=475133" title="Edme Mariotte">
<text>Edme Mariotte (; ; c. 162012 May 1684) was a French physicist and priest (abbé). He is particularly well known for formulating Boyle&#x27;s law independently of Robert Boyle. Mariotte is also credited with designing the first Newton&#x27;s cradle.

== Biography ==
Born in Til-Châtel, Edme Mariotte was the youngest son of Simon Mariotte, administrator at the district Til-Châtel (died 16 August 1652), and Catherine Denisot (died 26 September 1636 due to plague). His parents lived in Til-Châtel and had 4 other children: Jean, Denise, Claude, and Catharine. Jean was administrator in the Parlement of Paris from 1630 till his death in 1682. Denise and Claude, both married, stayed in the Dijon region, where as Catharine married Blaise de Beaubrieul, advisor of king Louis de XIV. Catherine and Blaise lived in the same street 16, perhaps on the same address, where Jean lived. The early life of Edme Mariotte is unknown. His title &quot;Sieur de Chazeuil&quot; was probably inherited from his brother Jean in 1682. It refers to the estate of his father, which was first given to Jean. This estate was in the region Chazeuil. It is not clear whether Mariotte spent most of his early life at Dijon, and whether he was prior of St Martin sous Beaune. There are no references to confirm this. In 1668 Colbert invited Mariotte to participate in the &quot;l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot;, the French equivalence of the Royal Society. From that time on he published several articles. 

In 1670 Mariotte moved to Paris. The address on a letter found in the Leibniz archive shows that Edme lived in the rue de Bertin-Poirree, near the chapel of the guild of the goldsmiths in the rue des Orfèvres in 1677. Perhaps he lived together with Jean and the couple Catherine and Blaise de Beaubreuil. Leibniz wrote that Edme stayed at Mr. Beaubrun&#x27;s address, but probably he meant Beaubreuil, which sounds quite similar. Edme died on 12 May 1684 in Paris.

== Career ==
Mariotte is best known for his recognition in 1679 of Boyle&#x27;s law about the inverse relationship of volume and pressures in gases. In 1660 he had discovered the eye&#x27;s blind spot. A small coin placed in the blind spot disappears from vision, a seemingly magical event that amazed the French royal court when first presented by Mariotte. He was one of the first members of the French Academy of Sciences founded at Paris in 1666.


The first volume of the &quot;Histoire et mémoires de l&#x27;Académie&quot; (1733) contains many original papers by him upon a great variety of physical subjects, such as the motion of fluids, the nature of colour, the notes of the trumpet, the barometer, the fall of bodies, the recoil of guns, the freezing of water, the absorption of heat rays by glass etc. His &quot;Essais de physique&quot;, four in number, of which the first three were published at Paris between 1676 and 1679, are his most important works, and form, together with a &quot;Traité de la percussion des corps&quot;, the first volume of the &quot;Œuvres de Mariotte&quot; (2 vols., Leiden, 1717).

The second of these essays (&quot;De la nature de l&#x27;air&quot;) contains the statement of the law that the volume of a gas varies inversely as the pressure. It was made from the discovery by Robert Boyle in 1662; Mariotte said Boyle&#x27;s theory was right only when the temperature is constant. However, outside France it is best known as Boyle&#x27;s law.

The fourth essay is a systematic treatment of the nature of colour, with a description of many curious experiments and a discussion of the rainbow, halos, parhelia, diffraction, and the more purely physiological phenomena of colour. He also made a significant contribution to the development of aerodynamic theory with the statement that aerodynamic resistance varies as the square of the velocity. The discovery of the blind spot is noted in a short paper in the second volume of his collected works.

===Newton&#x27;s cradle===
Marriote invented what is today known as Newton&#x27;s cradle to demonstrate Newton&#x27;s first law and the collision of suspended bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.
 Newton acknowledged Mariotte&#x27;s work, among that of others, in his &quot;Principia&quot;.

<doc id="475134" wikidata="Q514481" url="?curid=475134" title="Eigg">
<text>Eigg ( ; ) is one of the Small Isles in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. It lies to the south of the island of Skye and to the north of the Ardnamurchan peninsula. Eigg is long from north to south, and east to west. With an area of just over it is the second-largest of the Small Isles after Rùm. The highest eminence on Eigg is The Sgùrr, which is formed from the Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone Formation, which erupted into a valley of older lavas during the Eocene epoch.

There are numerous archaological sites dating from the prehistoric period of human occupation with the earliest written references relating to the Irish monk Donnán who arrived on Eigg around 600 AD. Commencing in the early 9th century, Norse settlers established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides. The 1266 Treaty of Perth transferred the territories of the Kingdom of the Isles to King Alexander III of Scotland. From the late 14th century, the island became a possession of Clanranald, during which time a notorious massacre took place during a period of clan warfare. After more than four centuries in Clanranald&#x27;s hands, the island was sold during the 19th century, and the new laird evicted many of his tenants en masse and replaced them with herds of sheep.

There were then a series of owners until the island was purchased by the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust in 1997. The trust is a form of community ownership and another stakeholder, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, manages the island as a nature reserve. Eigg now generates virtually all of its electricity using renewable energy. In April 2019, &quot;National Geographic&quot; discussed the island in an online article, estimating the average number of annual visitors at 10,000.

==Geology==

The larger part of the island is formed from olivine-phyric basalt flows erupted during the Palaeocene epoch. Together with flows of hawaiite and mugearite, these form the Eigg Lava Formation. The Sgùrr is formed from the Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone Formation, a porphyritic rhyolitic pitchstone that erupted into a valley eroded into the older lavas during the Eocene epoch. It displays columnar jointing formed as the lava cooled.

In the north of the island are a series of sedimentary rocks of Middle Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous age. The oldest of these, and hence lowest from a stratigraphic perspective is the fossiliferous Bearreraig Sandstone which is calcareous in nature. It is overlain by the Lealt Shale which consists of a lower and an upper grey shale (respectively the Kildonnan and Lonfearn members) separated by a thin band of algal limestone. The shale is overlain by the thicker Valtos Sandstone which contains concretions. It is found along the east coast northwards from Poll nam Parlan and around the northern end and down the eastern side of the Bay of Laig. This in turn is overlain by the bivalve-rich limestone and shale of the Duntulm Formation and lastly the dark shales and ostracod-bearing limestones of the Kilmaluag Formation. A fossilised limb bone, considered most likely to be from a Middle Jurassic stegosaurian dinosaur, was discovered at a coastal exposed Valtos Sandstone Formation in 2020; it is the first confirmed dinosaur fossil to be found in Scotland away from the Isle of Skye. The Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) age Strathaird Limestone Formation is the youngest part of the Mesozoic sequence preserved beneath the unconformity at the base of the Eigg lavas and its found in a strip along the coast just west of the bay of Laig.

Both the igneous and the sedimentary rocks are cut through by a swarm of Palaeocene age dykes generally aligned NW-SE. A handful of faults are mapped on the same alignment, the two most significant ones stretching SE from Bay of Laig. A band of microsyenite stretches around the hillside southeast of the Sgùrr. Isolated pockets of peat of postglacial origin are to be found behind Bay of Laig whilst to its north are areas of hummocky moraine. Landslips occupy the whole coastal strip in the northeast of the island and the embayment behind Bay of Laig and effectively mask much of the outcrop of the Mesozoic sediments.

==Geography==

Eigg measures and is by sea from the nearest port of Mallaig. The centre of the island is a moorland plateau, rising to at An Sgùrr, a dramatic stump of pitchstone which is the &quot;most memorable landmark in the Hebridean seas&quot;. Walkers who reach the top can, in good weather, take in views of Mull, Coll, Muck, the Outer Hebrides, Rùm, Skye, and the mountains of Lochaber on the mainland.

The plateau in the northern part of the island, at Beinn Buidhe, drops to a fertile coastal plain on its western side, containing Cleadale, the main settlement on Eigg. At the southern end of the plain, in the centre of the island, lies the bay of Laig, known for its quartz beach, called the &quot;singing sands&quot; on account of the squeaking noise it makes if walked on when dry. The first written description of this effect was penned by Hugh Miller in the 19th century:
I struck it obliquely with my foot, where the surface lay dry... [which] elicited a shrill sonorous note... I walked over it, striking it obliquely with each step and with every blow the shrill note was repeated.

The plateau is cleaved by a central valley, stretching from the vicinity of Laig, in the north, to Galmisdale at its southeastern end, which forms the main port. Beyond the southeast coast lies the small islet of Eilean Chathastail.
==Etymology==

Adomnán calls the island &quot;Egea insula&quot; in his &quot;Vita Columbae&quot; (c. 700 AD). Other historical names have been &quot;Ega&quot;, and &quot;Ego&quot;. The Gaelic &quot;Eige&quot; means &quot;notch&quot; probably with reference to &quot;the marked depresssion that runs across the middle of the island&quot;. A 2013 study also suggested a possible Norse origin.

Eigg was also known as &quot;Eilean nam Ban Móra&quot; - &quot;the island of the great women&quot;. (Local tradition claims that the dun at Loch nam Ban Mora (see below) was once inhabited by unusually large women.) Martin Martin reported in 1703 that &quot;the natives dare not call this isle by its ordinary name of Egg when they are at sea, but island Nim-Ban-More.&quot;

Some of the island settlement names are of Norse origin. Cleadale () may mean &quot;valley of the ridged slope&quot;. The first element of Galmisdale is possibly a personal name. Laig may derive from &quot;muddy bay&quot;. Grulin is of Gaelic origin, meaning &quot;stony land&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===

At Rubh&#x27; An Tangaird, near Glamisdale on the southern coast, there are the remains of an oval house, with thick walls, and an upright stone at each side of the doorway. There are comparable structures in Shetland such as at Scord of Brouster, which suggests a neolithic date.

Evidence for the island having been occupied in the Bronze Age includes two axes and a cache of flints, one of them being thumbnail scraper found near Galmisdale, together with significant metalworking debris. A barbed-and-tanged flint arrowhead of uncertain date was found to the south of Kildonnan.

=== Iron Age ===

Early Iron Age hut circles are found throughout the island. One located near the northeast coast near &quot;Sron na h-Iolaire&quot; is close to a cave to which walls have been artificially added; several hammerstones are located in the cave and surrounding vicinity, some with concretions of crushed shells stuck to them. The cave site is difficult to reach leading archaeologists to speculate that the site may have been used for hermitic purposes.

Later in the Iron Age, the inhabitants of Eigg chose to fortify the island. Small fortifications restrict access to rocky knolls at Garbh Bealach west of Galmisdale and Poll Duchaill on the northwest coast and on the promontory of Rudha na Crannaig south of Kildonnan. More substantial duns existed at Galmisdale Point, and at Loch nam Ban Mora, the latter of which is located on an island.

=== Early Christianity ===
The Irish missionary activity which caused Columba to found a monastery on Iona also brought the Irish monk Donnán to Eigg around 600 AD, where he established a monastery, at &quot;Kildonnan&quot;. Columba had warned him of the dangers of settling in Pictish territory and Donnan was murdered on Eigg along with 52 of his monks in 617.

By the following century, the monastery was significant enough for the death of its &quot;superior&quot;, Oan, to be mentioned in the Annals of Ulster. The monastery, which was excavated in 2012, was located within an oval enclosure, surrounded by a ditch, housing a rectangular chapel in the centre, and with a handful of smaller buildings either side. A handful of early inscribed stone slabs were located there, of which one bears a Pictish design, comprising a hunting scene, with a cross on its obverse.

On the coast at the opposite side of the island, are 16 or more quare cairns, lined up neatly into groups; they are each between square, most being bordered by a stone kerb, and some having upright cornerstones. This form of cairn is usually associated with the Pictish kingdoms of the first millennium AD. The site may thus have some connection with the contemporary monastery at Kildonnan.
===Kingdom of the Isles===

Commencing in the early 9th century Norse settlers established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides. A silver/bronze sword handle from the beginning of this period was found in 1830, buried in a field named &quot;Dail Sithean&quot; near Kildonnan, together with an iron axehead, leather belt, buckle, wollen cloth, and a whetstone. Wetlands near Laig, (which became peat-bog, during later centuries) appear to have been used for storing partly finished boat parts, as was common in Viking Scandinavia. A few oak posts, in length, for the stern of a longship were found there. A simple bronze brooch was found at a nearby site.

By the late 11th century the Isles were controlled by the Crovan dynasty but the dictatorial style of Guðrøðr Óláfsson (aka Godred the Black) appears to have made him very unpopular with the Islesmen, and the ensuing conflicts were the beginning of the end for Mann and the Isles as a coherent territory under the rule of a single magnate. The powerful barons of the isles began plotting with an emerging and forceful figure – Somerled, Lord of Argyll. Godred engaged Somerled&#x27;s forces in the naval Battle of Epiphany in 1156. There was no clear victor, but it was subsequently agreed that Godred would remain the ruler of Man, the northern Inner Hebrides and the Outer Hebrides, whilst Somerled&#x27;s young sons would nominally control the southern Inner Hebrides, Kintyre and the islands of the Clyde under their father&#x27;s supervision.

By the mid 13th century the Small Isles were in Lordship of Garmoran, a possession of Clan MacRory founded by Somerled&#x27;s grandson Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill. At this point the islands was nominally subject to Norway but in 1266, the Treaty of Perth transferred the territories of the Kingdom of the Isles to Alexander III of Scotland and Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí, Lord of Garmoran, found that he had a new overlord. He, and others who had supported the Norse, had the opportunity to emigrate under the terms of the treaty and Dubhghall died in 1268, possibly in exile.

By 1337 the sole MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran, who in that year married John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, leader of the MacDonalds, the most powerful group among Somerled&#x27;s heirs. Circa 1350 they divorced and John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the MacDonald lands. As compensation, John granted Lordship of the Uists to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey, and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran, including Eigg.
===Early Clanranald rule===

Upon the death of John of Islay his son Donald, Ranald&#x27;s half-brother, was named Lord of the Isles at Kildonan on Eigg in 1387. Ranald, who became the founder of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald, appeared content with this decision by his father as suggested in the Charter of 1373, the misgivings of many of the noblemen of the Isles notwithstanding.

However, when Ranald died in 1386 at Castle Tioram, Godfrey seized his lands, leading to violent disputes between his heirs (the Siol Gorrie) and those of Ranald (Clanranald). In 1427 James I arrested the leaders and declared the Lordship of Garmoran forfeit. 

Ranald Bane MacAllan, leader of Clanranald, refused to support the rebellion of Donald Dubh against James IV. In 1505, after the rebellion was defeated, he was &quot;now in high favour at Court&quot;. In 1520, Ranald Bane&#x27;s son Dougall, the 6th chief of Clanranald, was assassinated by his own clansmen in part for his lack of opposition to the crown. Leadership of Clanranald then passed not to his sons but to the Moidart branch of the clan. In 1534 John Moidartach, 8th of Clanranald, managed to obtain from the king a charter confirming his position as laird of Eigg and Morar.

Writing in 1549, Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles wrote of &quot;Egge&quot; that it was: &quot;gude mayne land with ane paroch kirk in it, with mony solenne geis; very gude for store, namelie for scheip, with ane heavin for heiland Galayis&quot;.

====Massacre cave====
&quot;Uamh Fhraing&quot;, also known as the Cave of Francis or the Ribbed Cave, lies on a raised beach on the south coast of Eigg. The entrance is low and narrow but the interior is about long and wide. In 1577, according to Clan MacLeod historians, a MacLeod galley was forced ashore by bad weather at Eilean Chathasteil. Led by a foster-son of Alasdair Crotach the 30 men roasted some cattle and &quot;molested&quot; the young girls who were tending them. The local men then arrived on the islet and massacred most of the MacLeods, sparing only a few leaders whose legs and arms were broken and who were then cast adrift in the Minch. They were however either rescued by MacLeods from elsewhere or perhaps drifted back to Dunvegan. In the MacDonald version of the story the girls were raped and the Macleods were asked to leave. Looking for revenge, a large group of MacLeods led by Alasdair Crotach landed on Eigg, but had been spotted by the islanders, all but one of whom decided to hide in the cave.

The traditions go on to say that the MacLeods conducted a thorough but fruitless search for the inhabitants. They found only an old lady at the singing sands who they spared and left the island after 3 days. Just as they were leaving they saw a scout outside the cave and were able to follow their footprints in the snow to the entrance. The MacLeods piled thatch and heather at the cave entrance, and set fire to it. Water from a waterfall nearby dampened the flames, so that the cave was filled with smoke, asphyxiating the 395 people inside. Human remains inside the cave have been reported many times over the centuries. Most of the remains were removed from the cave and reburied by 1854 although occasionally further sets of human bones are exposed.

However, serious doubts remain about the veracity of the tale. MacPherson wrote of it that &quot;it is curious to find how difficult it is to determine its date or to decide with certainty on whom the odium of this deed should lie.&quot; The difficulties include that both Alasdair Crotach and his son Uilleam died long before 1577 and that similar stories are related about both Coll and Ardnamurchan. Furthermore, Privy Council papers from 1588 describe massacres on all the Small Isles perpetuated by Lachlan MacLean of Duart and 100 Spanish soldiers from the crew of an Armada vessel that sank off Tobermory. The idea that two such massacres occurred on Eigg within eleven years has thus been questioned.

===Jacobite risings===
Clan Ranald took part in the Jacobite rising of 1689 against William II. The following year a boat had gone from Eigg to Armadale on Skye and found that the Royal Navy ship the &quot;Dartmouth&quot; was anchored there. A brawl broke out and one of the Cameronian soldiers was killed. The captain ordered the &quot;Dartmouth&quot; to Eigg and pillaged the island. The soldiers also took an island girl on board and returned her the next day with her hair shorn.

The men of Eigg also rose and fought in both the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. After the failure of the rebellion a navy vessel arrived on the island seeking one of the Clanranald officers, John MacDonald of Kinlochmoidart. After his discovery on the island all 38 surviving islanders who had served in the &#x27;45 were arrested by Captain John Ferguson. They were held on board &quot;H.M.S. Furnace&quot; and remained there when it became a prison hulk anchored in the River Thames off Gravesend, Kent. Although many died aboard the &quot;Furnace&quot; from torture, disease, or starvation, the remaining 16 were eventually transported to the Colony of Barbados and the Colony of Jamaica, to work as slave laborers on sugar cane plantations.

===19th century clearances===

The 18th century introduction of the potato to Eigg lead to increased yields compared to cereal growing and by the end of the century the population had expanded to about 500 The outbreak of the Peninsular War created a potential new route to wealth, by limiting foreign supplies of valuable minerals. Kelp could be harvested to produce soda ash and rapidly increased in price. In 1817, the estate factors reduced the size of each tenancy (for example, Cleadale was re-arranged into 28 plots), to stop their tenants from becoming self-sufficient and forcing them to also harvest kelp in order to break even. However, soon after the creation of these smaller tenancies (crofts), foreign mineral supplies were re-introduced, as the Napoleonic Wars had ended. The kelp price crashed and the crofters struggled to avoid destitution.

Some families voluntarily emigrated to Antigonish County, Nova Scotia to escape both rising rents and crushing poverty. They settled on a high plateau near the coast of the Northumberland Strait, which they named Eigg Mountain. Meanwhile, like many other Anglo-Scottish landlords during the Highland Clearances, Ranald George Macdonald, 19th Chief of Clanranald issued orders to evict the whole village of Cleadale, and use the land for sheep; both to cover his debts and to continue funding his extremely extravagant spending.

Raonuill Dubh&#x27;s son Aonghas Lathair MacDhòmhnaill took over the tack of Eigg and gained local infamy by beginning evictions from Cleadale. When severe hardships fell upon Aonghas Lathair and his family, which resulted in the tacksman dying by suicide, the old people of Eigg blamed the family&#x27;s misfortune on the curse that was said to have been put on them by the women whom he had evicted from Cleadale. In 1827 Macdonald found someone willing to purchase Eigg, and cancelled further evictions. After 440 years Clan Ranald rule of Eigg had come to an end.

=== Later lairds ===
The purchaser and new owner of Eigg was Dr. Hugh MacPherson, a Sub-Principal at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen. He was not wealthy and had 12 children but was well-connected. The Scottish geologist and writer Hugh Miller visited the island in the 1840s and wrote a long and detailed account of his explorations in his book &quot;The Cruise of the Betsey&quot; published in 1858. Miller was a self-taught geologist and the book contains detailed observations of the geology of the island, including An Sgùrr and the singing sands.

The financial woes of the islanders were compounded by the Highland Potato Famine. Furthermore, Dr. MacPherson decided to evict his tenants en masse and replace them with herds of sheep. In 1853, the whole village of Gruilin was cleared and all but three families emigrated to Nova Scotia. One woman who was left behind never recovered from the evictions and threw herself into the sea off the cliffs. Three more villages were similarly cleared shortly thereafter.

The MacPhersons sold Eigg to Robert Thompson, a wealthy shipbuilder, in 1893. He died in 1913 and is buried on Eilean Chathastail. After being sold by Thompson&#x27;s family in 1917, the island passed through various hands, including the cabinet minister, Walter Runciman, until being purchased by Keith Schellenberg in 1975. Unlike his predecessors, who had sought to use the resources of the island for their own power, profit, or leisure, Schellenberg had conservationist motives; he wished to restore its listed buildings, and preserve the natural environment.

==Gaelic literature and music==

One of the men from Eigg who joined the Clanranald forces in the Jacobite rising of 1715 was Iain Dubh Mac Iain &#x27;ic Ailein, the tacksman at Grulin. He was a well-known poet whose works include &quot;Trod nam Ban Eiggach&quot; that satirises the sharp-tongued women of the island and &quot;Bruadar mo Chor na Rioghachd&quot; (&quot;A Dream about the State of the Nation&quot;). The latter is a pro-Jacobite Aisling, or dream vision poem, in which he hopes to see Queen Anne ripped apart by deerhounds.

After the death of his father Raonuill Dubh MacDhòmhnuill, the eldest son of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, moved from Arisaig to become Clanranald tacksman of Laig. While serving as tacksman Raonuill Dubh collected and published the poetry anthology called &quot;Comh-chruinneachidh Orannaigh Gaidhealach&quot;, or &quot;The Eigg Collection&quot;, in Edinburgh in 1776. He is believed to have drawn heavily upon oral poetry collected by his father and also upon a similar poetry collection made by Dr. Hector Maclean of Grulin. The latter manuscript contains an additional 104 pages of material, including fourteen of Tiree-born Canadian Gaelic bard Iain mac Ailein&#x27;s poems in his own hand, and is now preserved in the Nova Scotia Archives.

Allan MacDonald collected numerous Catholic hymns and works of oral poetry by Donald MacLeod, a &quot;seanchaidh&quot; from Eigg resident in Oban. MacDonald supplemented these with several of his own compositions and translations and anonymously published a Gaelic hymnal in 1893.

Donald MacQuarrie was a resident of Grulin who became a pupil of piper Raghnall Mac Ailein Òig of Morar during the latter&#x27;s visits to Eigg in the late 17th century. He developed quickly and received further support from the MacCrimmon piping family on Skye, becoming known as - &quot;the great piper&quot;.

War poet and Seanchaidh Hugh MacKinnon (1894-1972), a veteran of the First World War, composed a Gaelic lament for the fallen soldiers of the island, &quot;Ò, tha mi &#x27;n-duigh trom fo lionn-dubh&quot;, (&quot;I am today sad and mournful&quot;), which is still read aloud at the Eigg War Memorial every November 11.

==Religion==

===Catholicism===

Allan, 9th chief of Clanranald, commenced the rebuilding of the Kildonnan Chapel on the site of Donnan&#x27;s 7th century monastery in honour of his father, John Moidartach&#x27;s, vow to build seven new churches on his lands. However it was likely never completed as it was found as an unroofed ruin by Fr. Cornelius Ward in 1625.

Ward, a Franciscan friar, had been sent by the Catholic Church in Ireland in order to proselytise the population of Scotland&#x27;s west coast. His &quot;chatty mission report&quot; indicates that he converted 198 individuals and baptised 16 during his 8-day visit. (The only family not to convert were relatives of the Protestant minister of Sleat, Neil MacKinnon.) Infuriated by Ward&#x27;s success, MacKinnon set off for Eigg in the company of some soldiers with the intention of arresting Ward but the islanders threatened him sufficiently forcefully to secure his withdrawal. The Clanranald bailie later persuaded him to turn a blind eye, in return for the island&#x27;s tithes.
The friar was unable to reconsecrate the Chapel and it came to only be used for burials. One grave had a carved cover popularly re-interpreted as a medieval sheela na gig. Martin Martin recorded a ritual in 1703 that suggests that visiting priests were at pains to integrate traditional beliefs into their formal doctrines. 
&quot;There is a well, called St. Katherine’s Well; the natives have it in great esteem, and believe it to be a catholicon for diseases. They told me that it had been such ever since it was consecrated by one Father Hugh, a Popish priest, in the following manner: he obliged all the inhabitants to come to this well, and then employed them to bring together a great heap of stones at the head of the spring, by way of penance. This being done, he said mass at the well, and then consecrated it; he gave each of the inhabitants a piece of wax candle, which they lighted, and all of them made the dessil, of going round the well sunways, the priest leading them: and from that time it was accounted unlawful to boil any meat with the water of this well.&quot;
To evade the religious persecution the British government imposed upon the Catholic Church in Scotland and which contributed to the Jacobite risings, the laity secretly and illegally attended mass at a mass stone inside a large high-roofed coastal cave, which can only be accessed during low tide, now known as Cathedral Cave. Later, Catholic worship moved into &quot;the lower floor of an old farmhouse&quot; which remained the island&#x27;s Mass house until 1910. In that year, St Donan of Eigg Roman Catholic Church was built in Cleadale by the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles and continues to be served by visiting priests from Morar.

===Church of Scotland===
The Reformation made slow headway in the Gàidhealtachd of Scotland due to the lack of Gaelic-speaking ministers. Eigg became part of the parish of Sleat in 1624 but there were no converts at that time. The Small Isles became a Church of Scotland parish in their own right in 1740. The first minister was Donald McQueen, who rarely ventured to Eigg as the only significant Protestant populations were on Muck and Rum. Malcolm Macaskill, known as &quot;Maighstir Calum&quot;, who became the incumbent in 1757 had the benefit of glebe land at Kildonnan to farm and he leased more land at Sandaveg and Sandavore. The glebe was later moved to Sandaveg and was the largest in Scotland at the time. The Skye Presbytery gave up a plan to rebuild the church at Kildonnan in favour of building a two-storey manse for him. This was not completed until 1790 and the first occupant was the new minister, Donald MacLean. MacLean developed a reputation for heavy drinking and was eventually deposed by the General Assembly.

The &quot;New Statistical Account&quot; of 1831 was penned by Revd. Neil Maclean, who noted that the parish had no road or church, no post or other regular means of communicating with the mainland and only one inn – at Galmisdale on Eigg. John Swanson became minister in 1838 and five years after his arrival he left the kirk and joined the Free Church of Scotland during the Disruption of 1843. Prior to his arrival relationships between the Catholic and Protestant populations of Eigg had been good and marriages between the two were common. However, Swanson’s zealous fight against “Popery” led to increasing sectarianism. Swanson built a new school where lessons were taught in Gaelic, leading to a significant increase in literacy. He also introduced Gaelic bibles to the island, the teachings of which (now being accessible to ordinary citizens) led to growing anti-landlord feelings amongst the oppressed tenants. Having left the established church Swanson also had to leave the manse. All but three of his congregation of 200 followed him into the Free Church but he was denied the landlord’s permission to build himself a house. Instead, he bought a small sailboat – the &quot;Betsey&quot;, later used by Hugh Miller - and “turned it into a floating manse”.

==Community buy-out==

In the early 1990s, a fire at Schellenberg&#x27;s home on the island destroyed a 1920s Rolls-Royce; Police suspected the fire was due to arson. Some locals claimed that since the late 1980s, he had neglected homes, closed the community hall, and restricted leases. While admitting that he had closed the community hall (but only in the evenings), and had refused to continue one particular lease, he told the press that &quot;drunken hippies and drop-outs&quot; were unfairly branding him a despot. In 1994, now in his 60s, Schellenberg concluded that trying to conserve the island was not worth facing violent intimidation for, and in the following year sold it to Gotthilf Christian Eckhard Österle from Germany who styled himself &quot;Professor Marlin Eckhard-Maruma&quot; or simply &quot;Maruma&quot; and who claimed to an artist; Schellenberg retained ownership of the 18th century Manse.
Nevertheless, by then a community trust had been formed by the Highland Council, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, and a number of residents – particularly those newly moved to the island – with a view to buying Eigg from the laird. In 1997, this Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust persuaded Eckhard to sell, and bought it from him. The ceremony to mark the handover took place a few weeks after the 1997 General Election and was attended by the Scottish Office Minister, Brian Wilson, a long-standing advocate of land reform; he used the occasion to announce the formation of a Community Land Unit within Highlands and Islands Enterprise to support further land buy-outs in the region.
Between then and the 2011 census, the ordinarily resident population expanded from 65 to 83; this increase of 24 percent (six times greater than for the Scottish islands as a whole) was principally formed by young people who moved to Eigg to set up in business, as well as a handful of former residents returning to the island. However, by 2003, the residents&#x27; representatives on the trust&#x27;s board were entirely people who had moved to the island since the trust took over.

A few longstanding residents complained that the trust focused on the new residents, while ignoring the concerns of the families who had lived on the island for generations; for example, they complained that new mains power connections, and housing provision, was given to the families of trust members, not indigenous islanders. One islander from an old Eigg family declared that the trust &quot;is not a democracy ... it is the mafia&quot;. More recently, more positive articles have been published, showing a different picture of the island.

Eigg was featured on the American television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in November 2017 and an extended feature on its companion web site &quot;60 Minutes Overtime&quot; in July 2018.

In its 2019 coverage of the island, National Geographic provided this summary of the ownership and current situation: &quot;after years of neglect by the previous laird, or estate owner, the people gained ownership themselves in 1997. Now, visitors to the nicknamed “People’s Republic of Eigg” contend with nothing more dangerous than negotiating walking territory with sheep or engaging in cheeky yet informative banter with Charlie Galli, the sole taxi driver and self-proclaimed &#x27;Eigg Gazette&#x27;&quot; ... there is a single main road ... and a single stoplight ... to alert everyone when electricity is running low ... humble attractions like the tiny post-office-turned-museum detailing island history; a wee, closet-size shed boasting handcrafted curiosities for sale by the honor system; herds of distrustful sheep; and pit stops such as “Rest and Be Thankful,” a patio tea garden open only when the sun shines.

==Economy and transport==
Tourism is important to the local economy, especially in the summer months, and the first major project of the Heritage Trust was An Laimhrig, a new building near the jetty to house the island&#x27;s shop and post office, Galmisadale Bay restaurant and bar, a craft shop, and toilet and shower facilities, which are open 24 hours a day. A&#x27;Nead Hand Knitwear is a new island business making garments such as cobweb shawls and scarves.

Conde Nast Traveller particularly recommends that visitors explore the Singing Sands beach, &quot;dark Cathedral and Massacre caves, the abandoned village of Grulin or the island’s most distinctive sight, the near vertically-sided volcanic plug of An Sgùrr&quot;.

There are two ferry routes to the island. There is a sheltered anchorage for boats at Galmisdale in the south of the island. In 2004 the old jetty there was extended to allow a roll-on roll-off ferry to dock. The Caledonian MacBrayne ferry sails a circular route around the four &quot;Small Isles&quot;—Eigg, Canna, Rùm and Muck from the fishing port of Mallaig. Arisaig Marine also runs a passenger ferry called the MV &quot;Sheerwater&quot; from April until late September from Arisaig on the mainland.

Around 2014 a beer brewery called &quot;Laig Bay Brewing&quot; was set up on the island.

In November 2017, a crew from the American television news magazine 60 Minutes visited Eigg. Its report stated that there was &quot;one grocery shop, one primary school for five students and one pub at the tea room down by the wharf. The island&#x27;s tiny electrical grid powers it all ... a combination of wind, hydroelectric and solar&quot;.

===Electrification project===
The Heritage Trust provisioned a mains electricity grid, powered from near 100% renewable energy sources. Previously, the island was not served by mains electricity and individual crofthouses had wind, hydro or diesel generators and the aim of the project is to develop an electricity supply that is environmentally and economically sustainable.

The new system incorporates a 9.9 kWp PV system, three hydro generation systems (totalling 112 kW) and a 24 kW wind farm supported by stand-by diesel generation, ultra-capacitors, flywheels and batteries to guarantee continuous availability of power. A load management system has been installed to provide optimal use of the renewables. This combination of solar, wind and hydro power should provide a network that is self-sufficient and powered 98 percent from renewable sources. On 1 February 2008 the system was switched on.

Eigg Electric generates a finite amount of energy and so Eigg residents agreed from the outset to cap electricity use at 5 kW at any one time for households, and 10 kW for businesses. If renewable resources are low, for example when there is less rain or wind, a &quot;traffic light&quot; system asks residents to keep their usage to a minimum. The traffic light reduces demand by up to 20 percent and ensures that there&#x27;s always enough energy for everyone.

The Heritage Trust has formed a company, Eigg Electric Ltd, to operate the new £1.6 million network, which has been part funded by the National Lottery and the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company.
===Other sustainability projects===

In September 2008, Eigg began a year-long series of projects as part of their success as one of ten finalists in NESTA&#x27;s Big Green Challenge. While the challenge finished in September 2009, the work to make the island &quot;green&quot; is continuing with solar water panels, alternative fuels, mass domestic insulation, transport and local food all being tackled. In May 2009, the island hosted the &quot;Giant&#x27;s Footstep Family Festival&quot;, which included talks, workshops, music, theatre and advice about what individuals and communities can do to tackle climate change.

In January 2010, Eigg was announced as one of three joint winners in NESTA&#x27;s Big Green Challenge, winning a prize of £300,000. Eigg also won the prestigious Ashden UK Gold Award in July 2010.

==Lighthouse==

Eigg lighthouse is an active lighthouse located on the south-eastern corner of the islet of Eilean Chathastail, one of the smaller Small Isles about off Eigg. The lighthouse was built in 1906 to a design by David A. and Charles Alexander Stevenson; it is a cylindrical metal tower only high with gallery and lantern painted white. It is a minor light among those owned by Northern Lighthouse Board but day-to-day management rests with the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust. The light emits a white flash every 6 seconds.

==Wildlife==

An average of 130 species of birds are recorded annually. The island has breeding populations of various raptors: golden eagle, buzzard, peregrine falcon, kestrel, hen harrier and short and long-eared owl. Great northern diver and jack snipe are winter visitors, and in summer cuckoo, whinchat, common whitethroat and twite breed on the island.

<text>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a natriuretic peptide hormone secreted from the cardiac atria that in humans is encoded by the &quot;NPPA&quot; gene. Natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) are a family of hormone/paracrine factors that are structurally related. The main function of ANP is causing a reduction in expanded extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by increasing renal sodium excretion. ANP is synthesized and secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the walls of the atria in the heart. These cells contain volume receptors which respond to increased stretching of the atrial wall due to increased atrial blood volume.

Reduction of blood volume by ANP can result in secondary effects such as reduction of extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, improved cardiac ejection fraction with resultant improved organ perfusion, decreased blood pressure, and increased serum potassium. These effects may be blunted or negated by various counter-regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently on each of these secondary effects.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) – a misnomer; it is secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the heart ventricles – is similar to ANP in its effect. It acts via the same receptors as ANP does, but with 10-fold lower affinity than ANP. The biological half-life of BNP, however, is twice as long as that of ANP, and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better choices than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.

== Clinical significance ==

A member of the natriuretic peptide gene family, &quot;NPPA&quot; encodes an important cardiac signaling molecule known as atrial natriuretic peptide/factor (ANP). ANP carries out endocrine functions of the heart. It acts as a diuretic by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. ANP also acts in the heart to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and to regulate vascular remodeling and energy metabolism. &quot;NPPA&quot; expression is varied throughout mammalian development into adulthood. Fetal expression of &quot;NPPA&quot; is associated with the formation of chamber myocardium, muscle cells of the atria and ventricles in the early developing heart. Early expression of this gene has been associated with ventricular hypertrophy in both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; models. &quot;NPPA&quot; variants affect plasma ANP concentrations, blood pressure levels, and cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF). ANP-deficient mice were found to have a large increase in heart and left ventricular weight in response to volume overload, which is normally prevented by proper regulation of blood pressure. Using a knock-in (KI) rat model, researchers found an AF-associated human variant in &quot;NPPA&quot; caused inflammation, fibroblast activation, atrial fibrosis, and AF in KI rats. These findings suggest NPPA is a critical gene in cardiac development and dysfunction of this gene can lead to heart problems via altered ANP levels.

== Discovery ==
The discovery of a natriuretic factor (one that promotes kidney excretion of salt and water) was first reported by Adolfo José de Bold in 1981 when rat atrial extracts were found to contain a substance that increased salt and urine output in the kidney. Later, the substance was purified from heart tissue by several groups and named atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) or ANP.

== Structure ==
ANP is a 28-amino acid peptide with a 17-amino acid ring in the middle of the molecule. The ring is formed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues at positions 7 and 23. ANP is closely related to BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide), which all share a similar amino acid ring structure. ANP is one of a family of nine structurally similar natriuretic hormones: seven are atrial in origin.

== Production ==
ANP is synthesized as an inactive preprohormone, encoded by the human NPPA gene located on the short arm of chromosome 1. The NPPA gene is expressed primarily in atrial myocytes and consists of 2 introns and three exons, with translation of this gene yielding a high molecular mass 151 amino acid polypeptide known as preproANP. The preprohormone is activated via post-translational modification that involves cleavage of the 25 amino acid signal sequence to produce proANP, a 126 amino acid peptide that is the major form of ANP stored in intracellular granules of the atria. Following stimulation of atrial cells, proANP is released and rapidly converted to the 28-amino-acid C-terminal mature ANP on the cell surface by the cardiac transmembrane serine protease corin. Recently, it was discovered that ANP also can be &quot;O&quot;-glycosylated.

ANP is secreted in response to:
* Stretching of the atrial wall, via Atrial volume receptors
* Increased Sympathetic stimulation of β-adrenoceptors
* Increased sodium concentration (hypernatremia), though sodium concentration is not the direct stimulus for increased ANP secretion
* Endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor

== Receptors ==
Three types of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors have been identified on which natriuretic peptides act. They are all cell surface receptors and designated:

* guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) also known as natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA/ANPA) or NPR1
* guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B) also known as natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPRB/ANPB) or NPR2
* natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPRC/ANPC) or NPR3

NPR-A and NPR-B have a single membrane-spanning segment with an extracellular domain that binds the ligand. The intracellular domain maintains two consensus catalytic domains for guanylyl cyclase activity. Binding of a natriuretic peptide induces a conformational change in the receptor that causes receptor dimerization and activation.

The binding of ANP to its receptor causes the conversion of GTP to cGMP and raises intracellular cGMP. As a consequence, cGMP activates a cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG or cGK) that phosphorylates proteins at specific serine and threonine residues. In the medullary collecting duct, the cGMP generated in response to ANP may act not only through PKG but also via direct modulation of ion channels.

NPR-C functions mainly as a clearance receptor by binding and sequestering ANP from the circulation. All natriuretic peptides are bound by the NPR-C.

== Physiological effects ==
Maintenance of the ECF volume (space), and its subcompartment the vascular space, is crucial for survival. These compartments are maintained within a narrow range, despite wide variations in dietary sodium intake. There are three volume regulating systems: two salt saving systems, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and the renal sympathetic system (RSS); and the salt excreting natriuretic peptide (NP) hormone system. When the vascular space contracts, the RAAS and RSS are &quot;turned on&quot;; when the atria expand, NPs are &quot;turned on&quot;. Each system also suppresses its counteracting system(s). NPs are made in cardiac, intestinal, renal, and adrenal tissue: ANP in one of a family of cardiac NPs: others are BNP, CNP, and DNP.

ANP binds to a specific set of receptors – ANP receptors. Receptor-agonist binding causes the increase in renal sodium excretion, which results in a decreased ECF and blood volume. Secondary effects may be an improvement in cardiac ejection fraction and reduction of systemic blood pressure.

=== Renal ===
ANP acts on the kidney to increase sodium and water excretion (natriuresis) in the following ways:
* The medullary collecting duct is the main site of ANP regulation of sodium excretion. ANP effects sodium channels at both the apical and basolateral sides.  ANP inhibits ENaC on the apical side and the sodium potassium ATPase pump on the basolateral side in a cGMP PKG dependent manner resulting in less sodium re-absorption and more sodium excretion.
* ANP increases glomerular filtration rate and glomerular permeability.  ANP directly dilates the afferent arteriole and counteracts the norepinephrine induced vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole.  Some studies suggest that ANP also constricts the efferent arteriole, but this is not a unanimous finding.  ANP inhibits the effect of Angiotensin II on the mesangial cells, thereby relaxing them.  ANP increases the radius and number of glomerular pores, thereby increasing glomerular permeability and resulting in greater filter load of sodium and water.
* Increases blood flow through the vasa recta, which will wash the solutes (sodium chloride (NaCl), and urea) out of the medullary interstitium. The lower osmolarity of the medullary interstitium leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion.
* Decreases sodium reabsorption at least in the thick ascending limb (interaction with NKCC2) and cortical collecting duct of the nephron via guanosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) dependent phosphorylation of ENaC. 
* It inhibits renin secretion, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. 
* It inhibits the renal sympathetic nervous system.

ANP has the opposite effect of angiotensin II on the kidney: angiotensin II increases renal sodium retention and ANP increases renal sodium loss.

=== Adrenal ===

* Reduces aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.

=== Vascular ===

Relaxes vascular smooth muscle in arterioles and venules by:
* Membrane Receptor-mediated elevation of vascular smooth muscle cGMP
* Inhibition of the effects of catecholamines

Promotes uterine spiral artery remodeling, which is important for preventing pregnancy-induced hypertension.

=== Cardiac ===

* ANP inhibits cardiac hypertrophy in heart failure as well as fibrosis. Fibrosis is inhibited by preventing fibroblasts from entering heart tissue and replicating, as well as decreasing inflammation. ANP prevents hypertrophy by inhibiting calcium influx that is caused by norepinephrine.
* Re-expression of NPRA rescues the phenotype.

=== Adipose tissue ===

* Increases the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Plasma concentrations of glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids are increased by i.v. infusion of ANP in humans.
* Activates adipocyte plasma membrane type A guanylyl cyclase receptors NPR-A
* Increases intracellular cGMP levels that induce the phosphorylation of a hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin A via the activation of a cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I (cGK-I)
* Does not modulate cAMP production or PKA activity.

=== Immune System ===
ANP is produced locally by several immune cells. ANP is shown to regulate several functions of innate and adaptive immune system as well as shown to have cytoprotective effects.

* ANP modulates innate immunity by raising defence against extracellular microbes and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory markers and expression of adhesion molecules.
* There is evidence of cytoprotective effects of ANP in myocardial, vascular smooth, endothelial, hepatocytes and tumour cells.

== Degradation ==

Modulation of the effects of ANP is achieved through gradual degradation of the peptide by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Recently, NEP inhibitors have been developed, such as Sacubitril and Sacubitril/valsartan. They may be clinically useful in treating patients in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction .

== Biomarker ==

Fragments derived from the ANP precursor, including the signal peptide, N-terminal pro-ANP and ANP, have been detected in human blood. ANP and related peptides are used as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure. A specific ANP precursor called mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) is a highly sensitive biomarker in heart failure. MRproANP levels below 120 pmol/L can be used to effectively rule out acute heart failure.

Large amounts of ANP secretion has been noted to cause electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia) and polyuria. These indications can be a marker of a large atrial myxoma.

== Therapeutic use and drug development ==

Opinions regarding the use of ANP for the treatment of acute heart failure and kidney disease are varied. While this molecule has been shown to successfully restore some hemodynamic parameters following heart failure, and yield clinical improvement for kidney injury, whether it ultimately reduces mortality and its long-term effects are unknown. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted to better understand the therapeutic effects of ANP. Newly synthesized homologues of ANP molecule are being assessed for the treatment of acute heart failure. Preliminary research on one of such molecules, ularitide, has shown that this drug is safe, well tolerated, and effective in the treatment of acute heart failure.

== Other natriuretic peptides ==

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) – a misnomer; it is secreted by ventricular myocytes – is similar to ANP in its effect. It acts via atrial natriuretic peptide receptors but with 10-fold lower affinity than ANP. The biological half-life of BNP, however, is twice as long as that of ANP, and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better choices than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.

In addition to the mammalian natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP), other natriuretic peptides with similar structure and properties have been isolated elsewhere in the animal kingdom. A salmon natriuretic peptide known as salmon cardiac peptide has been described, and dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP) has been found in the venom of the green mamba, as well as an NP in a species of African snake.

Beside these four, five additional natriuretic peptides have been identified: long-acting natriuretic peptide (LANP), vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide, urodilatin, and adrenomedullin.

== Pharmacological modulation ==

Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) also known as neprilysin is the enzyme that metabolizes natriuretic peptides. Several inhibitors of NEP are currently being developed to treat disorders ranging from hypertension to heart failure. Most of them are dual inhibitors (NEP and ACE). In 2014, PARADIGM-HF study was published in NEJM. This study considered as a landmark study in treatment of heart failure. The study was double blinded; compared LCZ696 versus enalapril in patients with heart failure. The study showed lower all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in LCZ696 arm.
Omapatrilat (dual inhibitor of NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme) developed by BMS did not receive FDA approval due to angioedema safety concerns. Other dual inhibitors of NEP with ACE/angiotensin receptor are (in 2003) being developed by pharmaceutical companies.

== Synonyms ==
ANP is also called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH), cardionatrine, cardiodilatin (CDD), and atriopeptin.

==See also==
* Renin-angiotensin system: When the blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus decreases, blood pressure is considered low, and the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct, thereby increasing blood pressure.
* Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure.
* Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure.
* Antidiuretic hormone: The hypothalamus detects the extracellular fluid hyperosmolality and the posterior pituitary gland secretes antidiuretic hormone to increase water reabsorption in the collecting duct.

<text>The Mandrake Press was a British small press founded by Edward Goldston and P. R. Stephensen in 1929. In 1930, the company had financial problems and a consortium led by Aleister Crowley formed Mandrake Press Ltd to take it over. The consortium was likewise unsuccessful, and the company was dissolved in 1930.

==Notable authors==
Mandrake Press published over 30 items, including D. H. Lawrence, &quot;The Paintings of D H Lawrence&quot; together with works by Liam O&#x27;Flaherty, Rhys Davies, Giovanni Boccaccio, Peter Warlock under the pseudonym &quot;Rab Noolas&quot;, S. S. Koteliansky, Aleister Crowley, Thomas Burke, Cecil Roth, Beresford Egan, W. J. Turner, Brinsley MacNamara, Edgell Rickword, Richard Barham Middleton, V. V. Rozanov, Philip Owens, Vernon Knowles, and others.

==Notable publications==
At the 1985 Cambridge University Exhibition of the works of The Mandrake Press, it was believed that no copies of the Book of Tobit, a part of the Catholic bible, had been produced, even though the book had been announced and a prospectus issued. Since then, three copies have been discovered – one in an Australian library and two in private collections.

<text>A patch is data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resource such as a program or a file, often to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities. A patch may be created to improve functionality, usability, or performance. A patch is typically provided by a vendor for updating the software that they provide. A patch may be created manually, but commonly it is created via a tool that compares two versions of the resource and generates data that can be used to transform one to the other.

Typically, a patch needs to be applied to the specific version of the resource it is intended to modify, although there are exceptions. Some patching tools can detect the version of the existing resource and apply the appropriate patch, even if it supports multiple versions. As more patches are released, their cumulative size can grow significantly, sometimes exceeding the size of the resource itself. To manage this, the number of supported versions may be limited, or a complete copy of the resource might be provided instead.

Patching allows for modifying a compiled (machine language) program when the source code is unavailable. This demands a thorough understanding of the inner workings of the compiled code, which is challenging without access to the source code. Patching also allows for making changes to a program without rebuilding it from source. For small changes, it can be more economical to distribute a patch than to distribute the complete resource. 

Although often intended to fix problems, a poorly designed patch can introduce new problems (see software regressions). In some cases updates may knowingly break the functionality or disable a device, for instance, by removing components for which the update provider is no longer licensed. Patch management is a part of lifecycle management, and is the process of using a strategy and plan of what patches should be applied to which systems at a specified time. Typically, a patch is applied via programmed control to computer storage so that it is permanent. In some cases a patch is applied by a programmer via a tool such as a debugger to computer memory in which case the change is lost when the resource is reloaded from storage.

== Types ==
=== Binary patches ===
Patches for proprietary software are typically distributed as executable files instead of source code. When executed these files load a program into memory which manages the installation of the patch code into the target program(s) on disk.

Patches for other software are typically distributed as data files containing the patch code. These are read by a patch utility program which performs the installation. This utility modifies the target program&#x27;s executable file—the program&#x27;s machine code—typically by overwriting its bytes with bytes representing the new patch code. If the new code will fit in the space (number of bytes) occupied by the old code, it may be put in place by overwriting directly over the old code. This is called an inline patch. If the new code is bigger than the old code, the patch utility will append load record(s) containing the new code to the object file of the target program being patched. When the patched program is run, execution is directed to the new code with branch instructions (jumps or calls) patched over the place in the old code where the new code is needed. On early 8-bit microcomputers, for example the Radio Shack TRS-80, the operating system includes a PATCH/CMD utility which accepts patch data from a text file and applies the fixes to the target program&#x27;s executable binary file(s).

The patch code must have place(s) in memory to be executed at runtime. Inline patches are no difficulty, but when additional memory space is needed the programmer must improvise. Naturally if the patch programmer is the one who first created the code to be patched, this is easier. Savvy programmers plan in advance for this need by reserving memory for later expansion, left unused when producing their final iteration. Other programmers not involved with the original implementation, seeking to incorporate changes at a later time, must find or make space for any additional bytes needed. The most fortunate possible circumstance for this is when the routine to be patched is a distinct module. In this case the patch programmer need merely adjust the pointers or length indicators that signal to other system components the space occupied by the module; he is then free to populate this memory space with his expanded patch code. If the routine to be patched does not exist as a distinct memory module, the programmer must find ways to shrink the routine to make enough room for the expanded patch code. Typical tactics include shortening code by finding more efficient sequences of instructions (or by redesigning with more efficient algorithms), compacting message strings and other data areas, externalizing program functions to mass storage (such as disk overlays), or removal of program features deemed less important than the changes to be installed with the patch.

Small in-memory machine code patches can be manually applied with the system debug utility, such as CP/M&#x27;s DDT or MS-DOS&#x27;s DEBUG debuggers. Programmers working in interpreted BASIC often used the POKE command to alter the functionality of a system service routine or the interpreter itself.

=== Source code patches ===
Patches can also circulate in the form of source code modifications. In this case, the patches usually consist of textual differences between two source code files, called &quot;diffs&quot;. These types of patches commonly come out of open-source software projects. In these cases, developers expect users to compile the new or changed files themselves.

=== Large patches ===
Because the word &quot;patch&quot; carries the connotation of a small fix, large fixes may use different nomenclature. Bulky patches or patches that significantly change a program may circulate as &quot;service packs&quot; or as &quot;software updates&quot;. Microsoft Windows NT and its successors (including Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7) use the &quot;service pack&quot; terminology. Historically, IBM used the terms &quot;FixPaks&quot; and &quot;Corrective Service Diskette&quot; to refer to these updates.

== History ==


Historically, software suppliers distributed patches on paper tape or on punched cards, expecting the recipient to cut out the indicated part of the original tape (or deck), and patch in (hence the name) the replacement segment. Later patch distributions used magnetic tape. Then, after the invention of removable disk drives, patches came from the software developer via a disk or, later, CD-ROM via mail. With widely available Internet access, downloading patches from the developer&#x27;s web site or through automated software updates became often available to the end-users. Starting with Apple&#x27;s Mac OS 9 and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows ME, PC operating systems gained the ability to get automatic software updates via the Internet.

Computer programs can often coordinate patches to update a target program. Automation simplifies the end-user&#x27;s task they need only to execute an update program, whereupon that program makes sure that updating the target takes place completely and correctly. Service packs for Microsoft Windows NT and its successors and for many commercial software products adopt such automated strategies.

Some programs can update themselves via the Internet with very little or no intervention on the part of users. The maintenance of server software and of operating systems often takes place in this manner. In situations where system administrators control a number of computers, this sort of automation helps to maintain consistency. The application of security patches commonly occurs in this manner.

With the advent of larger storage media and higher Internet bandwidth, it became common to replace entire files (or even all of a program&#x27;s files) rather than modifying existing files, especially for smaller programs.

==Application==
The size of patches may vary from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes; thus, more significant changes imply a larger size, though this also depends on whether the patch includes entire files or only the changed portion(s) of files. In particular, patches can become quite large when the changes add or replace non-program data, such as graphics and sounds files. Such situations commonly occur in the patching of computer games. Compared with the initial installation of software, patches usually do not take long to apply.

In the case of operating systems and computer server software, patches have the particularly important role of fixing security holes. Some critical patches involve issues with drivers. Patches may require prior application of other patches, or may require prior or concurrent updates of several independent software components. To facilitate updates, operating systems often provide automatic or semi-automatic updating facilities. Completely automatic updates have not succeeded in gaining widespread popularity in corporate computing environments, partly because of the aforementioned glitches, but also because administrators fear that software companies may gain unlimited control over their computers. Package management systems can offer various degrees of patch automation.

Usage of completely automatic updates has become far more widespread in the consumer market, due largely to the fact that Microsoft Windows added support for them, and Service Pack 2 of Windows XP (available in 2004) enabled them by default. Cautious users, particularly system administrators, tend to put off applying patches until they can verify the stability of the fixes. Microsoft (W)SUS supports this. In the cases of large patches or of significant changes, distributors often limit availability of patches to qualified developers as a beta test.

Applying patches to firmware poses special challenges, as it often involves the provisioning of totally new firmware images, rather than applying only the differences from the previous version. The patch usually consists of a firmware image in form of binary data, together with a supplier-provided special program that replaces the previous version with the new version; a motherboard BIOS update is an example of a common firmware patch. Any unexpected error or interruption during the update, such as a power outage, may render the motherboard unusable. It is possible for motherboard manufacturers to put safeguards in place to prevent serious damage; for example, the update procedure could make and keep a backup of the firmware to use in case it determines that the primary copy is corrupt (usually through the use of a checksum, such as a CRC).

==Video games==
Video games receive patches to fix compatibility problems after their initial release just like any other software, but they can also be applied to change game rules or algorithms. These patches may be prompted by the discovery of exploits in the multiplayer game experience that can be used to gain unfair advantages over other players. Extra features and gameplay tweaks can often be added. These kinds of patches are common in first-person shooters with multiplayer capability, and in MMORPGs, which are typically very complex with large amounts of content, almost always rely heavily on patches following the initial release, where patches sometimes add new content and abilities available to players. Because the balance and fairness for all players of an MMORPG can be severely corrupted within a short amount of time by an exploit, servers of an MMORPG are sometimes taken down with short notice in order to apply a critical patch with a fix.

Companies sometimes release games knowing that they have bugs. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Scorpia in 1994 denounced &quot;companies—too numerous to mention—who release shoddy product knowing they can get by with patches and upgrades, and who make ″&quot;pay&quot;-testers of their customers&quot;.

==In software development==
Patches sometimes become mandatory to fix problems with libraries or with portions of source code for programs in frequent use or in maintenance. This commonly occurs on very large-scale software projects, but rarely in small-scale development.

In open-source projects, the authors commonly receive patches or many people publish patches that fix particular problems or add certain functionality, like support for local languages outside the project&#x27;s locale. In an example from the early development of the Linux kernel (noted for publishing its complete source code), Linus Torvalds, the original author, received hundreds of thousands of patches from many programmers to apply against his original version. 

The Apache HTTP Server originally evolved as a number of patches that Brian Behlendorf collated to improve NCSA HTTPd, hence a name that implies that it is a collection of patches (&quot;a patchy server&quot;). The FAQ on the project&#x27;s official site states that the name &#x27;Apache&#x27; was chosen from respect for the Native American Indian tribe of Apache. However, the &#x27;a patchy server&#x27; explanation was initially given on the project&#x27;s website.

== Variants ==

=== Hotfix ===

A hotfix or Quick Fix Engineering update (QFE update) is a single, cumulative package that includes information (often in the form of one or more files) that is used to address a problem in a software product (i.e., a software bug). Typically, hotfixes are made to address a specific customer situation. Microsoft once used this term but has stopped in favor of new terminology: General Distribution Release (GDR) and Limited Distribution Release (LDR). Blizzard Entertainment, however, defines a hotfix as &quot;a change made to the game deemed critical enough that it cannot be held off until a regular content patch&quot;.

=== Point release ===

A point release is a minor release of a software project, especially one intended to fix bugs or do small cleanups rather than add significant features. Often, there are too many bugs to be fixed in a single major or minor release, creating a need for a point release.

=== Program temporary fix ===

Program temporary fix or Product temporary fix (PTF), depending on date, is the standard IBM terminology for a single bug fix, or group of fixes, distributed in a form ready to install for customers. A PTF was sometimes referred to as a “ZAP”.
Customers sometime explain the acronym in a tongue-in-cheek manner as &quot;permanent temporary fix&quot; or more practically &quot;probably this fixes&quot;, because they have the option to make the PTF a permanent part of the operating system if the patch fixes the problem.

=== Security patches ===
A &quot;security patch&quot; is a change applied to an asset to correct the weakness described by a vulnerability. This corrective action will prevent successful exploitation and remove or mitigate a threat&#x27;s capability to exploit a specific vulnerability in an asset. Patch management is a part of vulnerability management the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities.

Security patches are the primary method of fixing security vulnerabilities in software. Currently Microsoft releases its security patches once a month (&quot;patch Tuesday&quot;), and other operating systems and software projects have security teams dedicated to releasing the most reliable software patches as soon after a vulnerability announcement as possible. Security patches are closely tied to responsible disclosure.

These security patches are critical to ensure that business process does not get affected. In 2017, companies were struck by a ransomware called WannaCry which encrypts files in certain versions of Microsoft Windows and demands a ransom via BitCoin. In response to this, Microsoft released a patch which stops the ransomware from running.

=== Service pack ===

A service pack or SP or a feature pack (FP) comprises a collection of updates, fixes, or enhancements to a software program delivered in the form of a single installable package. Companies often release a service pack when the number of individual patches to a given program reaches a certain (arbitrary) limit, or the software release has shown to be stabilized with a limited number of remaining issues based on users&#x27; feedback and bug tracking such as Bugzilla. In large software applications such as office suites, operating systems, database software, or network management, it is not uncommon to have a service pack issued within the first year or two of a product&#x27;s release. Installing a service pack is easier and less error-prone than installing many individual patches, even more so when updating multiple computers over a network, where service packs are common.

=== Unofficial patches ===

An unofficial patch is a patch for a program written by a third party instead of the original developer. Similar to an ordinary patch, it alleviates bugs or shortcomings. Examples are security fixes by security specialists when an official patch by the software producers itself takes too long. Other examples are unofficial patches created by the game community of a video game which became unsupported.

=== Monkey patches ===
Monkey patching means extending or modifying a program locally (affecting only the running instance of the program).

== Hot patching ==
&quot;Hot patching&quot;, also known as &quot;live patching&quot; or &quot;dynamic software updating&quot;, is the application of patches without shutting down and restarting the system or the program concerned. This addresses problems related to unavailability of service provided by the system or the program. 
Method can be used to update Linux kernel without stopping the system.
A patch that can be applied in this way is called a &quot;hot patch&quot; or a &quot;live patch&quot;. This is becoming a common practice in the mobile app space. Companies like Rollout.io use method swizzling to deliver hot patches to the iOS ecosystem. Another method for hot-patching iOS apps is JSPatch.

Cloud providers often use hot patching to avoid downtime for customers when updating underlying infrastructure.

== Slipstreaming ==
In computing, slipstreaming is the act of integrating patches (including service packs) into the installation files of their original app, so that the result allows a direct installation of the updated app.

The nature of slipstreaming means that it involves an initial outlay of time and work, but can save a lot of time (and, by extension, money) in the long term. This is especially significant for administrators that are tasked with managing a large number of computers, where typical practice for installing an operating system on each computer would be to use the original media and then update each computer after the installation was complete. This would take a lot more time than starting with a more up-to-date (slipstreamed) source, and needing to download and install the few updates not included in the slipstreamed source.

However, not all patches can be applied in this fashion and one disadvantage is that if it is discovered that a certain patch is responsible for later problems, said patch cannot be removed without using an original, non-slipstreamed installation source.

== Software update systems ==
Software update systems allow for updates to be managed by users and software developers. In the 2017 Petya cyberpandemic, the financial software &quot;MeDoc&quot;&#x27;s update system is said to have been compromised to spread malware via its updates. On the Tor Blog, cybersecurity expert Mike Perry states that deterministic, distributed builds are likely the only way to defend against malware that attacks the software development and build processes to infect millions of machines in a single, officially signed, instantaneous update. Update managers also allow for security updates to be applied quickly and widely. Update managers of Linux such as Synaptic allow users to update all software installed on their machine. Applications like Synaptic use cryptographic checksums to verify source/local files before they are applied to ensure fidelity against malware.

== Malicious updates==
Some hacker may compromise legitimate software update channel and inject malicious code.

<text>Helen Cresswell (11 July 1934 – 26 September 2005) was an English television scriptwriter and author of more than 100 children&#x27;s books, best known for comedy and supernatural fiction. Her most popular book series, &quot;Lizzie Dripping&quot; and &quot;The Bagthorpe Saga&quot;, were also the basis for television series.

Cresswell&#x27;s TV work included adaptation of her own books for television movies and series: &quot;Lizzie Dripping&quot; (two series, 1973–75), &quot;Jumbo Spencer&quot; (1976), &quot;The Secret World of Polly Flint&quot; (1987), and &quot;Moondial&quot; (1988). Works by others that she adapted for TV include &quot;The Haunted School&quot;, &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (1991, from the 1902 novel), &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1997), &quot;The Famous Five&quot; (1995–96), and &quot;The Demon Headmaster&quot; (1996–98).

==Life==

Cresswell was born in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. Her mother arranged Greek-language instruction for her daughter. At age 12, she was in hospital for a year with spinal problems. She was educated at Nottingham High School for Girls, and at King&#x27;s College London, where she graduated in English literature. Cresswell and her childhood sweetheart Brian Rowe (married 1962, dissolved 1995) had two children. On 26 September 2005, she died in her home in Eakring, Nottinghamshire, aged 71, from ovarian cancer.

==Writer==
Cresswell had great &quot;popular impact&quot; because she &quot;diversified into writing for television, in 1960, with a script for what was then called &quot;Jack Playhouse&quot;, bringing simple storytelling to BBC children&#x27;s TV.&quot; She tried writing for adults but succeeded with the child audience. Her first book was published in 1960, &quot;Sonya-by-the-Shore&quot;, and the Jumbo Spencer series followed. Yet she considered herself a poet until &quot;The Piemakers&quot; (Faber, 1967) won both &quot;success with young readers&quot; and approval from critics. It was a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject.

She was one of three or four runners-up for the Carnegie Medal on three later occasions: namely, for &quot;The Night Watchmen&quot; (1969), &quot;Up the Pier&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Bongleweed&quot; (1973). In 1989, she won the Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association, recognising &quot;The Night Watchmen&quot; (Faber, 1969) as the best children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award.

Although the &quot;Demon Headmaster&quot; TV series (1996–1998) was a success, her &quot;star waned&quot; as the BBC &quot;turned to the tougher damaged heroines of Jacqueline Wilson, typified by Tracy Beaker, resident of The Dumping Ground.&quot; (Wilson introduced Beaker in 1991 and &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot; on television ran from 2002 to 2006.) Her daughter, Caroline, believed that &quot;Winter of the Birds&quot; (1976) had been her mother&#x27;s own favourite work. Cresswell once explained, &quot;I write a title, then set out to find where that particular road will take me&quot;, and Caroline recalled, &quot;Mum never plotted her books, she just wrote.&quot;

The BBC aired a six-part TV series, &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (1991), using Cresswell&#x27;s adaptation of the 1902 novel by E. Nesbit. Next year Cresswell&#x27;s print sequel was published, &quot;The Return of the Psammead&quot; (BBC Books, 1992), which was the basis for a TV sequel of the same name in 1993. She also adapted the second book in Nesbit&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1904), for a television serial transmitted in 1997.

<text>Gambling in Macau, a special administrative region of China, is the only place in China where casinos are legal. Gambling has been legal since the 1850s when the Portuguese government legalised the activity in the autonomous colony. After the handover of Macau from Portugal to China, Macau and the business has grown at an astounding pace since 2001, when the government ended the four-decade gambling monopoly of the Hong Kong billionaire Stanley Ho. With the entry of large foreign casinos from Las Vegas and Australia, Macau overtook the Las Vegas Strip in gambling revenues in 2007. Since then, Macau has become known worldwide as the &quot;gambling capital of the world&quot;, grossing the highest amount of gambling/gaming revenue and greatly dwarfing all the other gambling centers/cities.

Gambling tourism is Macau&#x27;s biggest source of revenue, making up about 50% of the economy. Visitors are largely from mainland China and Hong Kong. 

== History ==

In an attempt to generate revenues for the government, gambling in Macau was legalized by the Portuguese government in 1849. In the late 19th century, the government introduced a licensing system for the &quot;fantan&quot; houses (Chinese gambling houses). It is reported that over 200 gambling houses were required to pay gambling rent to the government. The second casino monopoly concession was granted to the Tai Heng Company in 1937. The company was, however, too conservative to fully exploit the economic potential of gambling.

The industry saw a major breakthrough in 1962 when the government granted the monopoly rights to all forms of gambling to &quot;Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau&quot; (STDM), run by Stanley Ho. The STDM introduced Western-style games and modernised the marine transport between Macau and Hong Kong, bringing millions of gamblers from Hong Kong every year. The license was extended in 1986 for another 15 years but expired at the end of 2001.

Over a three year period in the late 1990s, as wave of gang violence referred to as the casino wars occurred disrupted Macau&#x27;s casino industry. The casino wars were largely attributable to rival Triad groups who sought to gain control of Macau&#x27;s illicit industries before Portugal transferred the territory back to China. The Portuguese authorities of Macau mostly failed to address the violence, which resulted in 122 deaths, or to catch those responsible.

Macau was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1999 and became a special administrative region of China. During this transition, there were no changes to gambling policy in Macau.

In 2002, the Macau government ended the monopoly system and granted three (later six) casino operating concessions (and subconcessions) to: Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM, an 80% owned subsidiary of STDM), Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands, Galaxy Entertainment Group, the partnership of MGM Mirage and Pansy Ho Chiu-king, and the partnership of Melco and PBL. On 18 May 2004, the Sands Macau casino opened near the Macau Ferry Terminal. Today, there are 16 casinos operated by the STDM, and they are still crucial in the casino industry in Macau.

== Economic aspects ==

Macau&#x27;s economy relies heavily on gambling. Nowadays, the gambling industry generates over 40% of the GDP of Macau. Since the early 1960s, around 50% of Macau&#x27;s official revenue has been driven by gambling. The percentage remained steady until the late 1990s. In 1998, 44.5% of total government revenue was produced by the direct tax on gambling. Then there was a 9.1% decrease in 1999, probably due to internet gaming. After the handover of Macau from Portugal to China, the SAR released gambling licenses to other companies to eliminate the monopoly played by the STDM. In 2002, the government signed concession contracts with two Macau gaming companies, Wynn Resort Ltd. and Galaxy Casino. This opened the gambling market for competition and increased government tax revenue significantly. It also attracted more tourists to Macau.

As of at least 2015, 90% of tourist revenue in Macau is derived from gambling.

However, the gambling industry is also a source of instability in the Macau economy, as the nature of the gambling business is not susceptible to technological advancement or productivity growth. The gambling business is still dependent on the prosperity of other Asian economies, especially that of China. Due to Xi Jinping&#x27;s promise on cracking down of corruption across mainland China, casino profits from across Macau have been reporting a decline in monthly profits In addition, a proliferation of other gambling venues in the region is drawing the target demographic away. Macau&#x27;s 2018 grew 13% over the prior year, but this lagged behind the 41% growth in emerging casino markets in Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, according to Fitch Ratings. In 2019 casino earnings reached their lowest level in three years.

In 2020 Macau had a decline of 56 percent in revenue, and the number of monthly visitors fell from approximately 3 million before the COVID-19 pandemic to fewer than 1 million in 2021. The unemployment rate increased from an average of 2 percent over the past decade to 4.6 percent in the first quarter of 2022.

Taxes from gambling revenues fund a robust welfare system and an annual cash payment to Macau&#x27;s citizens.

== Gambling forms ==

=== Casinos ===
Macau has 41 casinos (as of 2019), of which the biggest is The Venetian Macao. Twenty-four casinos are located on the Macau Peninsula and 17 in Cotai. They all operate under a government franchise and under a common set of rules. The main casino operators in Macau are SJM Holdings, Galaxy Entertainment Group and Las Vegas Sands with respective revenues of 9.7, 4.8, and 4.2 billion in 2011.

A form of VIP contractual system called the junket trade operates in Macau. Junket agents recruit high rollers to Macau and advance the high rollers credit for gambling. The practice developed in the 1980s, when Stanley Ho began subcontracting private gambling rooms in his casinos to independent agents.

A wide range of games are available, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, boule, Sic bo, Fan Tan, keno and slot machines. Chinese gamblers generally prefer table games, the most popular of which is baccarat. Only approximately 5% of annual gaming revenues come from slot machines.

The &quot;punto banco&quot; version of baccarat is most common and, because it is purely a game of chance, offers the best odds of any table game in Macau&#x27;s casinos. Baccarat is the sole game played in Macau&#x27;s VIP rooms. Taxes derived from baccarat are the single largest source of public revenue in Macau.

Common conventions among baccarat players in Macau include chanting, blowing on cards, banging the table, and &quot;squeezing&quot; the cards. &quot;Squeezing&quot; the cards refers to folding over the sides and corners to slowly reveal the points value of the cards, rather than simply flipping them over. Although &quot;punto banco&quot; baccarat is a pure game of chance on which no rational bet can be made, many gamblers record the succession of Player or Banker wins in an effort to discern patterns. Gamblers typically do so on a chart called the Big Road on which Player and Banker wins can be recorded so that streaks can be readily observed. The popularity of tracking such results among gamblers in Macau has led to the practice being used at casinos throughout the world where Chinese people gamble.

Poker was introduced only in August 2007, in an electronic table format at Galaxy Starworld casino. The first live poker tournament was the Asia Pacific Poker Tour Macau event in November 2007. Shortly thereafter, in January 2008, the government of Macau published the official rules for Texas hold &#x27;em poker games in Macau. In February 2008, Grand Lisboa Casino added the first live-dealer cash game tables. In May 2008, &#x27;PokerStars Macau&#x27; opened at Grand Waldo Casino. In November 2008, Texas Holdem&#x27; Poker opened at Wynn Macau. &#x27;PokerStars Macau&#x27; moved to a new location at the Grand Lisboa Casino in March 2009. Today, Wynn Macau, StarWorld, and the Venetian offer live-dealer cash game poker tables.

Over the opposition of the casino industry, Macau implemented smoking prohibitions in casinos in October 2014. At the start of 2019, the restrictions were extended to Casino VIP rooms. These changes were largely motivated by the concerns of croupiers, who spoke out against their unhealthy work environments.

=== Horse racing ===

Horse racing is due to be permanently banned in Macau in April 2024, with the Taipa race-course closing on 1 April.

Other than casinos, there is betting at the Macau Jockey Club and the dog-racing Canidrome.

Horse-racing mainly takes place every Tuesday and Saturday or Sunday at the race-course on the Taipa Island of Macau. The race-course has an area of 450,000 square metres and 18,000 seats for gamblers, and is open only for people over 18 years of age.

The Macau Jockey Club was formerly the Macau Trotting Club. In 1991, it was acquired by a consortium led by Stanley Ho. The Macau Jockey Club is one of the largest private employers of Macau with around 1,400 employees and around 1,100 part-timers.

*Hong Kong Service Centres
Three service centres are now set up in Hong Kong including Shaukeiwan Service Centre, Sheung Wan Service Centre and Mongkok Service Centre.

=== Greyhound racing ===
Greyhound racing is permanently banned in Macau.

The Canidrome closed on 21 July 2018. After negotiations with the track&#x27;s owner and intense fundraising by an international group of volunteer-run, greyhound adoption organizations led by Anima, 517 greyhounds received veterinary medical care and were shuttled out to be adopted in Europe, North America, Australia, and, for a few, locally in Macau.

== Gaming law ==

Macau is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal.

The gambling age in Macau is 21. 
Detailed law is enforced to ensure &quot;qualified operation of gambling&quot; in Macau. The details are listed in Law 16/2001 (regime jurídico da exploração de jogos de fortuna ou azar em casino), and other laws regulating the activity of gaming promoters and credit for gaming.

The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (known as DICJ) is the main government unit that oversees the operation of different gaming activities.

Under Macau law, it stated that a permit issued by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau is required for the operation of lotteries sales, lucky draw or similar activities, and the initial procedure in the application on the operation of lotteries sales, lucky draw, or similar activities is to submit a notification to the relevant government department ten days prior to the application.

In the Macau legal system, gaming law is not considered as a branch of law in the traditional sense. Instead, it may be considered as a transversal gathering of a range of legal topics more or less directly related to gaming, including constitutional law, administrative law, tax law, company law, contract law, and criminal law. In this manner, issues of public law as well as private law are of relevance for gaming.

=== Tax law issues ===
The taxation of casino sub/concessionaires is made of a fixed part and a variable part. The variable part falls on the gross gaming revenue. The tax rate is currently of 35%, plus two contributions of up to 2% and 3% for social and economic purposes. The maximum tax is therefore 40%. In addition, a fixed premium is also payable, plus a premium per VIP table, other table, and slot machine. Gaming promoters pay taxes on commissions received.

=== Contract law issues ===
From the perspective of contract law, gaming and betting are contracts which may or may not generate civil or natural obligations for the parties. The matter is regulated in the Civil Code 1999 (art. 1171), which states, drawing from Roman law, that gaming and betting generate natural obligations except in sports competitions and where the law provides otherwise. The problem is that gaming legislation currently does not provide to this effect.

Regarding credit for gaming, Macau law states since 2004 that the granting of credit for casino games of fortune generates civil obligations, which are fully enforceable in Macau courts. Credit for casino games of fortune is defined as any case where chips are passed on to a player without immediate cash payment of such chips; this is an intentionally broad concept. Credit for gaming is regulated by Law no. 5/2004, of 14 June.

=== Criminal law issues ===
From the perspective of criminal law, there are specific criminal offences related to gaming. Law number 8/96/M, of 22 July, prohibits unauthorized gambling; Law number 9/96/M, of 22 July, prohibits animal racing; and Law number 6/97/M, of 30 July, prevents and prohibits organized crime. In addition, general laws on the prevention and repression of money laundering and the financing of terrorism through casinos apply. Cheating while gaming is mentioned in Article 6 of Law number 8/96/M, of 22 July.

=== Problem gambling ===
As of November 2011, exclusion of players from gambling establishments is voluntary. If the person realises that their gambling activities begin to cause trouble, they can turn to the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau to ban them from entering the casino. The government of Macau is seeking the opinions of the citizens on the possibility of establishing a programme that will allow excluding problem gamblers from all casinos without their consent. The Legislative Assembly is currently analyzing the new draft law, which also deals with the problem of exclusion from gambling houses. The law suggests that the person can be excluded from the casino if they submit their own request or approve the request submitted by their relatives.

=== Other matters ===
Competition law matters, and advertising law, as well as the impact of WTO law on gaming, may also be pointed out as part of gaming law. Regarding online gaming, the Macau SAR does not currently grant concessions for online casinos. The current casino concessions only cover land-based gaming, not online gaming.

Macau&#x27;s junket trade operates in a legal gray area. Macau&#x27;s gaming law expressly prohibits casinos from loaning money to gamblers, but does not expressly prevent private companies doing so via the junket trade.

In 2011, the Macau government implemented a citywide cap on the expansion of table games, which remained in effect through 2022. The cap limits expansion of table games to 3% and regulators apportion new tables to individual casinos. Electronic games are not counted as equivalent to table games for purposes of the cap. Thus, stadium style electronic games where one live dealer serves dozens of gamblers are still counted as one table for purposes of the cap.

=== Academic research and teaching ===
The teaching of Macau gaming law started in 2005 the Faculty of Business Administration of the University of Macau, in the undergraduate program of gaming management.
Since 2007 it is also included in the master program of international business law offered by the Faculty of Law of the University of Macau , in which various theses have already been defended in topics of gaming law.

<text>Structural bioinformatics is the branch of bioinformatics that is related to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules such as proteins, RNA, and DNA. It deals with generalizations about macromolecular 3D structures such as comparisons of overall folds and local motifs, principles of molecular folding, evolution, binding interactions, and structure/function relationships, working both from experimentally solved structures and from computational models. The term &quot;structural&quot; has the same meaning as in structural biology, and structural bioinformatics can be seen as a part of computational structural biology. The main objective of structural bioinformatics is the creation of new methods of analysing and manipulating biological macromolecular data in order to solve problems in biology and generate new knowledge.

== Introduction ==

=== Protein structure ===

The structure of a protein is directly related to its function. The presence of certain chemical groups in specific locations allows proteins to act as enzymes, catalyzing several chemical reactions. In general, protein structures are classified into four levels: primary (sequences), secondary (local conformation of the polypeptide chain), tertiary (three-dimensional structure of the protein fold), and quaternary (association of multiple polypeptide structures). Structural bioinformatics mainly addresses interactions among structures taking into consideration their space coordinates. Thus, the primary structure is better analyzed in traditional branches of bioinformatics. However, the sequence implies restrictions that allow the formation of conserved local conformations of the polypeptide chain, such as alpha-helix, beta-sheets, and loops (secondary structure). Also, weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) stabilize the protein fold. Interactions could be intrachain, i.e., when occurring between parts of the same protein monomer (tertiary structure), or interchain, i.e., when occurring between different structures (quaternary structure). Finally, the topological arrangement of interactions, whether strong or weak, and entanglements is being studied in the field of structural bioinformatics, utilizing frameworks such as circuit topology.

=== Structure visualization ===

Protein structure visualization is an important issue for structural bioinformatics. It allows users to observe static or dynamic representations of the molecules, also allowing the detection of interactions that may be used to make inferences about molecular mechanisms. The most common types of visualization are:

* Cartoon: this type of protein visualization highlights the secondary structure differences. In general, α-helix is represented as a type of screw, β-strands as arrows, and loops as lines.
* Lines: each amino acid residue is represented by thin lines, which allows a low cost for graphic rendering.
* Surface: in this visualization, the external shape of the molecule is shown. 
* Sticks: each covalent bond between amino acid atoms is represented as a stick. This type of visualization is most used to visualize interactions between amino acids...

=== DNA structure ===
The classic DNA duplexes structure was initially described by Watson and Crick (and contributions of Rosalind Franklin). The DNA molecule is composed of three substances: a phosphate group, a pentose, and a nitrogen base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine). The DNA double helix structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs: adenine with thymine (A-T) and cytosine with guanine (C-G). Many structural bioinformatics studies have focused on understanding interactions between DNA and small molecules, which has been the target of several drug design studies.

=== Interactions ===
Interactions are contacts established between parts of molecules at different levels. They are responsible for stabilizing protein structures and perform a varied range of activities. In biochemistry, interactions are characterized by the proximity of atom groups or molecules regions that present an effect upon one another, such as electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic effect. Proteins can perform several types of interactions, such as protein-protein interactions (PPI), protein-peptide interactions, protein-ligand interactions (PLI), and protein-DNA interaction.

=== Calculating contacts ===
Calculating contacts is an important task in structural bioinformatics, being important for the correct prediction of protein structure and folding, thermodynamic stability, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, docking and molecular dynamics analyses, and so on.

Traditionally, computational methods have used threshold distance between atoms (also called cutoff) to detect possible interactions. This detection is performed based on Euclidean distance and angles between atoms of determined types. However, most of the methods based on simple Euclidean distance cannot detect occluded contacts. Hence, cutoff free methods, such as Delaunay triangulation, have gained prominence in recent years. In addition, the combination of a set of criteria, for example, physicochemical properties, distance, geometry, and angles, have been used to improve the contact determination. 
== Protein Data Bank (PDB) ==

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a database of 3D structure data for large biological molecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. PDB is managed by an international organization called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), which is composed of several local organizations, as. PDBe, PDBj, RCSB, and BMRB. They are responsible for keeping copies of PDB data available on the internet at no charge. The number of structure data available at PDB has increased each year, being obtained typically by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, or cryo-electron microscopy.

=== Data format ===
The PDB format (.pdb) is the legacy textual file format used to store information of three-dimensional structures of macromolecules used by the Protein Data Bank. Due to restrictions in the format structure conception, the PDB format does not allow large structures containing more than 62 chains or 99999 atom records.

The PDBx/mmCIF (macromolecular Crystallographic Information File) is a standard text file format for representing crystallographic information. Since 2014, the PDB format was substituted as the standard PDB archive distribution by the PDBx/mmCIF file format (.cif). While PDB format contains a set of records identified by a keyword of up to six characters, the PDBx/mmCIF format uses a structure based on key and value, where the key is a name that identifies some feature and the value is the variable information.

=== Other structural databases ===
In addition to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), there are several databases of protein structures and other macromolecules. Examples include:

* MMDB: Experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of biomolecules derived from Protein Data Bank (PDB).
* Nucleic acid Data Base (NDB): Experimentally determined information about nucleic acids (DNA, RNA).
* Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP): Comprehensive description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between structurally known proteins.
* TOPOFIT-DB: Protein structural alignments based on the TOPOFIT method.
* Electron Density Server (EDS): Electron-density maps and statistics about the fit of crystal structures and their maps.
* CASP: Prediction Center Community-wide, worldwide experiment for protein structure prediction CASP.
* PISCES server for creating non-redundant lists of proteins: Generates PDB list by sequence identity and structural quality criteria.
* The Structural Biology Knowledgebase: Tools to aid in protein research design.
* ProtCID: The Protein Common Interface Database Database of similar protein-protein interfaces in crystal structures of homologous proteins.
* AlphaFold:AlphaFold - Protein Structure Database.

== Structure comparison ==

=== Structural alignment ===
Structural alignment is a method for comparison between 3D structures based on their shape and conformation. It could be used to infer the evolutionary relationship among a set of proteins even with low sequence similarity. Structural alignment implies superimposing a 3D structure over a second one, rotating and translating atoms in corresponding positions (in general, using the &quot;Cα&quot; atoms or even the backbone heavy atoms &quot;C&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;Cα&quot;). Usually, the alignment quality is evaluated based on the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the average distance between atoms after superimposition:

: formula_1

where &quot;δi&quot; is the distance between atom &quot;i&quot; and either a reference atom corresponding in the other structure or the mean coordinate of the &quot;N&quot; equivalent atoms. In general, the RMSD outcome is measured in Ångström (Å) unit, which is equivalent to 10−10 m. The nearer to zero the RMSD value, the more similar are the structures.

=== Graph-based structural signatures ===
Structural signatures, also called fingerprints, are macromolecule pattern representations that can be used to infer similarities and differences. Comparisons among a large set of proteins using RMSD still is a challenge due to the high computational cost of structural alignments. Structural signatures based on graph distance patterns among atom pairs have been used to determine protein identifying vectors and to detect non-trivial information. Furthermore, linear algebra and machine learning can be used for clustering protein signatures, detecting protein-ligand interactions, predicting ΔΔG, and proposing mutations based on Euclidean distance.

== Structure prediction ==

The atomic structures of molecules can be obtained by several methods, such as X-ray crystallography (XRC), NMR spectroscopy, and 3D electron microscopy; however, these processes can present high costs and sometimes some structures can be hardly established, such as membrane proteins. Hence, it is necessary to use computational approaches for determining 3D structures of macromolecules. The structure prediction methods are classified into comparative modeling and de novo modeling.

=== Comparative modeling ===
Comparative modeling, also known as homology modeling, corresponds to the methodology to construct three-dimensional structures from an amino acid sequence of a target protein and a template with known structure. The literature has described that evolutionarily related proteins tend to present a conserved three-dimensional structure. In addition, sequences of distantly related proteins with identity lower than 20% can present different folds.

=== &quot;De novo&quot; modeling ===
In structural bioinformatics, &quot;de novo&quot; modeling, also known as &quot;ab initio&quot; modeling, refers to approaches for obtaining three-dimensional structures from sequences without the necessity of a homologous known 3D structure. Despite the new algorithms and methods proposed in the last years, de novo protein structure prediction is still considered one of the remain outstanding issues in modern science.

=== Structure validation ===
After structure modeling, an additional step of structure validation is necessary since many of both comparative and &#x27;de novo&#x27; modeling algorithms and tools use heuristics to try assembly the 3D structure, which can generate many errors. Some validation strategies consist of calculating energy scores and comparing them with experimentally determined structures. For example, the DOPE score is an energy score used by the MODELLER tool for determining the best model.

Another validation strategy is calculating φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles of all residues and construct a Ramachandran plot. The side-chain of amino acids and the nature of interactions in the backbone restrict these two angles, and thus, the visualization of allowed conformations could be performed based on the Ramachandran plot. A high quantity of amino acids allocated in no permissive positions of the chart is an indication of a low-quality modeling.

=== Prediction tools ===
A list with commonly used software tools for protein structure prediction, including comparative modeling, protein threading, &quot;de novo&quot; protein structure prediction, and secondary structure prediction is available in the list of protein structure prediction software.

== Molecular docking ==
Molecular docking (also referred to only as docking) is a method used to predict the orientation coordinates of a molecule (ligand) when bound to another one (receptor or target). The binding may be mostly through non-covalent interactions while covalently linked binding can also be studied. Molecular docking aims to predict possible poses (binding modes) of the ligand when it interacts with specific regions on the receptor. Docking tools use force fields to estimate a score for ranking best poses that favored better interactions between the two molecules.

In general, docking protocols are used to predict the interactions between small molecules and proteins. However, docking also can be used to detect associations and binding modes among proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA molecules, carbohydrates, and other macromolecules.

=== Virtual screening ===
Virtual screening (VS) is a computational approach used for fast screening of large compound libraries for drug discovery. Usually, virtual screening uses docking algorithms to rank small molecules with the highest affinity to a target receptor.

In recent times, several tools have been used to evaluate the use of virtual screening in the process of discovering new drugs. However, problems such as missing information, inaccurate understanding of drug-like molecular properties, weak scoring functions, or insufficient docking strategies hinder the docking process. Hence, the literature has described that it is still not considered a mature technology.

== Molecular dynamics ==

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method for simulating interactions between molecules and their atoms during a given period of time. This method allows the observation of the behavior of molecules and their interactions, considering the system as a whole. To calculate the behavior of the systems and, thus, determine the trajectories, an MD can use Newton&#x27;s equation of motion, in addition to using molecular mechanics methods to estimate the forces that occur between particles (force fields).

== Applications ==
Informatics approaches used in structural bioinformatics are:
* Selection of Target - Potential targets are identified by comparing them with databases of known structures and sequence. The importance of a target can be decided on the basis of published literature. Target can also be selected on the basis of its protein domain. Protein domains are building blocks that can be rearranged to form new proteins. They can be studied in isolation initially.
* Tracking X-ray crystallography trials - X-Ray crystallography can be used to reveal three-dimensional structure of a protein. But, in order to use X-ray for studying protein crystals, pure proteins crystals must be formed, which can take a lot of trials. This leads to a need for tracking the conditions and results of trials. Furthermore, supervised machine learning algorithms can be used on the stored data to identify conditions that might increase the yield of pure crystals. 
* Analysis of X-Ray crystallographic data - The diffraction pattern obtained as a result of bombarding X-rays on electrons is Fourier transform of electron density distribution. There is a need for algorithms that can deconvolve Fourier transform with partial information ( due to missing phase information, as the detectors can only measure amplitude of diffracted X-rays, and not the phase shifts ). Extrapolation technique such as Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion can be used to generate electron density map, which uses the location of selenium atoms as a reference to determine rest of the structure. Standard Ball-and-stick model is generated from the electron density map. 
* Analysis of NMR spectroscopy data - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments produce two (or higher) dimensional data, with each peak corresponding to a chemical group within the sample. Optimization methods are used to convert spectra into three dimensional structures.
* Correlating Structural information with functional information - Structural studies can be used as probe for structural-functional relationship.

<text>Stoneware is a broad term for pottery fired at a relatively high temperature. A modern definition is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay. End applications include tableware, decorative ware such as vases. 

Stoneware is fired at between about to . Historically, reaching such temperatures was a long-lasting challenge, and temperatures somewhat below these were used for a long time.

It was developed independently in different locations around the world, after earthenware and before porcelain. Stoneware is not recognised as a category in traditional East Asian terminology, and much Asian stoneware, such as Chinese Ding ware for example, is counted as porcelain by local definitions. Terms such as &quot;porcellaneous&quot; or &quot;near-porcelain&quot; may be used in such cases. Traditional East Asian thinking classifies pottery only into &quot;low-fired&quot; and &quot;high-fired&quot; wares, equating to earthenware and porcelain, without the intermediate European class of stoneware, and the many local types of stoneware were mostly classed as porcelain, though often not white and translucent.

One definition of stoneware is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard. It states:

Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from porcelain because it is more opaque, and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed.

==Types==
Five basic categories of stoneware have been suggested:

* Traditional stoneware: a dense and inexpensive body. It is opaque, can be of any colour and breaks with a conchoidal or stony fracture. Traditionally made of fine-grained secondary, plastic clays which can be used to shape very large pieces.
* Fine stoneware: made from more carefully selected, prepared, and blended raw materials. It is used to produce tableware and art ware.
* Chemical stoneware: used in the chemical industry, and when resistance to chemical attack is needed. Purer raw materials are used than for other stoneware bodies. Has largely been replaced by chemical porcelain.
* Thermal shock resistant stoneware: has additions of certain materials to enhance the thermal shock resistance of the fired body.
* Electrical stoneware: historically used for electrical insulators, although it has been replaced by electrical porcelain.

Another type, Flintless Stoneware, has also been identified. It is defined in the UK Pottery (Health and Welfare) Special Regulations of 1950 as: &quot;Stoneware, the body of which consists of natural clay to which no flint or quartz or other form of free silica has been added.&quot;

==Production==

Materials

The compositions of stoneware bodies vary considerably, and include both prepared and &#x27;as dug&#x27;; the former being by far the dominant type for studio and industry. Nevertheless, the vast majority will conform to: plastic fire clays, 0 to 100%; ball clays, 0 to 15%; quartz, 0%; feldspar and chamotte, 0 to 15%.

The key raw material is either naturally occurring stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay. The mineral kaolinite is present but disordered, and although mica and quartz are present their particle size is very small. Stoneware clay is often accompanied by impurities such as iron or carbon, giving it a &quot;dirty&quot; look, and its plasticity can vary widely. Non-refractory fire clay may be another key raw material. Fire clays are generally considered refractory, because they withstand very high temperatures before melting or crumbling. Refractory fire clays have a high concentration of kaolinite, with lesser amounts of mica and quartz. Non-refractory fire clays, however, have larger amounts of mica and feldspar.

Shaping
Firing

Stoneware can be once-fired or twice-fired. Maximum firing temperatures can vary significantly, from 1100 °C to 1300 °C depending on the flux content. Most commonly an oxidising kiln atmosphere is used. Typically, temperatures will be between 1180 °C and 1280 °C. To produce a better quality fired glaze finish, twice-firing can be used. This can be especially important for formulations composed of highly carbonaceous clays. For these, biscuit firing is around 900 °C, and glost firing (the firing used to form the glaze over the ware) 1180–1280 °C. After firing the Water absorption should be less than 1 per cent.

==History==
===Asia===
The Indus Valley civilization produced stoneware, with an industry of a nearly industrial-scale mass-production of stoneware bangles throughout the civilization&#x27;s Mature Period (2600–1900 BC). Early examples of stoneware have been found in China, naturally as an extension of higher temperatures achieved from early development of reduction firing, with large quantities produced from the Han dynasty onwards.

In both medieval China and Japan, stoneware was very common, and several types became admired for their simple forms and subtle glaze effects. Japan did not make porcelain until about 1600, and north China (in contrast to the south) lacks the appropriate kaolin-rich clays for porcelain on a strict Western definition. Jian ware in the Song dynasty was mostly used for tea wares, and appealed to Buddhist monks. Most Longquan celadon, a very important ware in medieval China, was stoneware. Ding ware comes very close to porcelain, and even modern Western sources are notably divided as to how to describe it, although it is not translucent and the body often grey rather than white.

In China, fine pottery largely consisted of porcelain by the Ming dynasty, and stoneware was mostly restricted to utilitarian wares and those for the poor. Exceptions to this include the unglazed Yixing clay teapot, made from a clay believed to suit tea especially well, and Shiwan ware, used for popular figures and architectural sculpture.

In Japan many traditional types of stoneware, for example Oribe ware and Shino ware, were preferred for chawan cups for the Japanese tea ceremony, and have been valued up to the present for this and other uses. From a combination of philosophical and nationalist reasons, the primitive or folk art aesthetic qualities of many Japanese village traditions, originally mostly made by farmers in slack periods in the agricultural calendar, have retained considerable prestige. Influential tea masters praised the rough, spontaneous, &quot;wabi-sabi&quot;, appearance of Japanese rural wares, mostly stoneware, over the perfection of Chinese-inspired porcelain made by highly skilled specialists.

Stoneware was also produced in Korean pottery, from at least the 5th century, and much of the finest Korean pottery might be so classified; like elsewhere the border with porcelain is imprecise. Celadons and much underglaze blue and white pottery can be called stoneware.

Historical stoneware production sites in Thailand are Si Satchanalai and Sukhothai. The firing technology seems to have come from China.

===Europe===
In contrast to Asia, stoneware could be produced in Europe only from the late Middle Ages, as European kilns were less efficient, and the right sorts of clay less common. Some ancient Roman pottery had approached being stoneware, but not as a consistent type of ware. Medieval stoneware remained a much-exported speciality of Germany, especially along the Rhine, until the Renaissance or later, typically used for large jugs, jars and beer-mugs. &quot;Proto-stoneware&quot;, such as Pingsdorf ware, and then &quot;near-stoneware&quot; was developed there by 1250, and fully vitrified wares were being produced on a large scale by 1325. The salt-glazed style that became typical was not perfected until the late 15th century.
England became the most inventive and important European maker of fancy stoneware in the 18th and 19th centuries, but there is no clear evidence for native English stoneware production before the mid-17th century. German imports were common from the early 16th century at least, and known as &quot;Cologne ware&quot;, after the centre of shipping it rather than of making it. Some German potters were probably making stoneware in London in the 1640s, and a father and son Wooltus (or Woolters) were doing so in Southampton in the 1660s.

In the second half of the 18th century Wedgwood developed a number of ceramic bodies. One of these, Jasperware, is sometimes classified as stoneware although its raw materials differ considerably from all other stonewares; it remains in production. Other manufacturers produced their own types, including various ironstone china types, which some classified as earthenware.

Significant amounts of modern, commercial tableware and kitchenware use stoneware, and it is common in craft and studio pottery. The popular Japanese-inspired raku ware is normally stoneware.

==Historical examples==

* Bartmann jug: A decorated stoneware form that was manufactured in Europe throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, especially in the Cologne region of Germany.
*Redware: Unglazed stoneware with a terracotta red, initially imitating Chinese Yixing ware teapots. Mostly c. 1680–1750. The Dutch-German Elers brothers brought it to Staffordshire in the 1690s. 
* Böttger Ware: A dark red stoneware developed by Johann Friedrich Böttger by 1710, a superior form of redware. It is a very significant stage in the development of porcelain in Europe.
* Cane Ware: An eighteenth-century English stoneware of a light brownish-yellow colour (like bamboo), developed by Josiah Wedgwood in the 1770s. During the 19th and the earlier part of the 20th century, cane ware continued to be made in South Derbyshire and the Burton-on-Trent area as kitchen-ware and sanitary-ware. It had a fine-textured cane-coloured body with a white engobe on the inner surface often referred to as cane and white.
* Crouch Ware, now often just called Staffordshire: salt-glazed stoneware. Light-coloured, developed in 1696 in Burslem. It is one of the earliest types of stoneware made in England. The origin of the name has been disputed: on one theory, the ingredients included a clay from Crich, Derbyshire, the word &quot;crouch&quot; being a corruption. On another, it comes from Creussen near Bayreuth in Bavaria, whose type of tall &quot;cruche&quot; jugs were called &quot;crouch&quot; when imported to England. 
* Jasperware: Another Wedgwood development, using tinted clay bodies in contrasting colours, unglazed.
* Rosso Antico: A red, unglazed stoneware made in England during the 18th century by Josiah Wedgwood. It was a refinement of the redware previously made in North Staffordshire by the Elers brothers.
* Coade stone: A type of artificial stone moulded into sculptures and architectural details, imitating marble. Developed in England around 1770.
* Ironstone china - patented in 1813, often classed as earthenware, but very strong and vitreous, and popular for wares with heavy usage.
* Stone china - made in Staffordshire, mainly in the first half of the 19th century. Very hard, opaque, giving &quot;a clear ring when lightly tapped&quot;. Typically brightly decorated by transfer printing, often with outlines that were finished in overglaze enamels by hand. 
* American stoneware: The predominant houseware of 19th century North America, where the alternatives were less developed.

<text>The Atheriniformes, also known as the silversides, are an order of ray-finned fishes that includes the Old World silversides and several less-familiar families, including the unusual Phallostethidae. The order includes at least 354 species. They are found worldwide in tropical and temperate marine and freshwater environments.

== Description ==
Atheriniformes are generally elongated and silvery in colour, although exceptions do exist. They are typically small fish, with the largest being the Argentinian silverside, with a head-body length of , but possibly up to 82 cm (32 in). The smallest species, such as the Bangkok minnow, reach only in adult length.

Members of the order usually have two dorsal fins, the first with flexible spines, and an anal fin with one spine at the front. The lateral line is typically weak or absent. Atheriniform larvae share several characteristics; the gut is unusually short, a single row of melanophores occurs along the back, and the fin rays do not become evident until some time after hatching. They scatter their eggs widely, with most species attaching them to aquatic plants.

== Taxonomy ==
Classification of the Atheriniformes is uncertain, with the best evidence for monophyly in the larval characteristics mentioned below. Their closest relatives are thought to be the Cyprinodontiformes.

Nelson 2016 recognizes the infraseries Atherinomorpha, part of the sub series Ovalentaria which includes the orders Atheriniformes, Beloniformes, and Cyprinodontiformes, citing the larval characteristics and supporting molecular studies of these taxa as support for monophyly of this grouping. The sister taxon to the Atherinomorpha appears to be the Mugiliformes.

Following Nelson (2006), the family Melanotaeniidae includes the subfamilies Bedotiinae, Melanotaeniinae, Pseudomugilinae, and Telmatherininae, to demonstrate their monophyly. However, in a 2004 study, a different classification scheme classifies the families Bedotiidae, Melanotaeniidae, and Pseudomugilidae (also include Telmatherinine genera) in a suborder Melanotaenioidei. Thus, the number of families in Atheriniformes varies from author to author.

Nelson 2016 classifies the Atheriniformes into the following 2 suborders and 8 families:

* Order Atheriniformes
** Suborder Atherinopsoidei
*** Family Atherinopsidae (New World silversides)
*** Family Notocheiridae (Surf silversides)
** Suborder Atherinoidei
*** Family Isonidae (Surf sardines)
*** Family Melanotaeniidae (Rainbowfishes and blue eyes)
*** Family Atherionidae (Pricklenose silversides)
*** Family Dentatherinidae (Mercer&#x27;s tusked silverside)
*** Family Phallostethidae (Priapiumfishes)
*** Family Atherinidae (Old World silversides)

<text>Novgorod Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Veliky Novgorod. Some of the oldest Russian cities, including Veliky Novgorod and Staraya Russa, are located in the oblast. The historic monuments of Veliky Novgorod and surroundings have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Population: 583,387 (2021 Census).

==Geography==

Novgorod Oblast borders with Leningrad Oblast in the north and in the northwest, Vologda Oblast in the east, Tver Oblast in the southeast and in the south, and Pskov Oblast in the southwest, which coincidentally has a similar amount of land area as Novgorod Oblast.

The western part is a lowland around Lake Ilmen, while the eastern part is a highland (northern spurs of the Valdai Hills). The highest point is in the Valdai Hills (). In the center of the oblast is Lake Ilmen, one of the largest lakes in Central Russia. The major tributaries of Lake Ilmen are the Msta, which originates in the east of the Valdai Hills and collects the rivers in the east of the oblast, the Lovat, the Pola, and the Polist, which all flow to the lake from the south, and the Shelon, flowing from the southwest. The only outflow of the lake is the Volkhov, a major tributary of Lake Ladoga. Almost all of the oblast belongs to the river basin of the Volkhov. The exceptions are the northwest, which belongs to the river basin of the Luga, a tributary of the Baltic Sea, the north, belonging to the basin of the Syas, another tributary of Lake Ladoga, the east, which belongs to the basin of the Mologa, a tributary of the Volga, and the south, belonging to basins of various tributaries of the upper Volga River. Sorted by the discharge, the biggest rivers of the oblast are the Volkhov, the Mologa, the Msta, the Lovat, the Syas, and the Shelon.

The south and the southeast of the oblast contain one of the largest lake districts in European Russia. The biggest lake in the area, Lake Seliger, is divided between Novgorod and Tver Oblasts. Other big lakes in the area include Lake Valdayskoye, , , , and .

Two areas in Novgorod Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas of federal significance. These are Valdaysky National Park in the southeast of the oblast, protecting the lake district and related ecosystems and cultural landscapes, and Rdeysky Nature Reserve in the southwest of the oblast, which protects the Polist-Lovat Swamp System and is adjacent to Polistovsky Nature Reserve in Pskov Oblast.

==History==
Novgorod is one of the oldest centers of Russian civilization. It lay on the historical trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, which followed the Volkhov upstream to Lake Ilmen and then followed the course of the Lovat before eventually reaching the Dnieper River. Novgorod is indicated in the chronicles as the site where Rurik settled and founded the Rurik Dynasty in 862. Subsequently, Rurik&#x27;s successor, Oleg, moved the capital to Kiev, but Novgorod continued to play an important role until the 15th century. In 1136, Novgorod evicted the prince and became the center of the Novgorod Republic, which included the major part of what is currently northwestern Russia. It was an example of a medieval republic, in which decisions were taken by veche—a meeting of the city population—and the prince was elected. (The only other Russian city with a similar organization was Pskov.) Novgorod linked the river routes of Baltic, Byzantium, Central Asian regions, and all parts of European Russia and flourished as one of the most important trading centres of eastern and northern Europe. It was part of the Hanseatic League which connected it to Central and Northern Europe. Novgorod was one of the few areas of Rus not affected by the Mongol invasions. It was also an important cultural center, and the majority of monuments preserved in Russia from the 11th through the 14th century are those standing in Veliky Novgorod.

Towards the end of the 15th century Novgorod was defeated by the army of Ivan III, the prince of Moscow, and was included into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1560, Ivan the Terrible, fearing treason, sent his army to sack the city. This event, known as the Massacre of Novgorod, had catastrophic consequences for the city, which lost the majority of its population and never recovered. Additionally, in the beginning of the 17th century, during the Time of Troubles, Novgorod was plundered by the Swedish army.

, 1708 Tsar Peter the Great issued an edict which established seven governorates. The present area of Novgorod oblast was a part of Ingermanland Governorate, which was renamed Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710. In 1727, a separate Novgorod Governorate was established. It was subdivided into five provinces, and the current area of Novgorod Oblast was split between two of them—Novgorod and Velikiye Luki Provinces. In 1772, Velikiye Luki Province was transferred to newly established Pskov Governorate. In 1775, Novgorod Governorate was transformed to Novgorod Viceroyalty, and in 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed to Pskov Viceroyalty. In 1796, both governorates were re-established. By the 1920s, most of the area of current Novgorod Oblast belonged to Novgorod Governorate.

Before the 19th century, the areas around Novgorod were considerably better developed than the areas which are currently located in the center and the east of the oblast. In 1851, Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway, the first long-distance railway in Russia, opened. It bypassed Novgorod as it was built on a straight line between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The railway construction lead to the development of the adjacent areas and eventually to creation of new towns such as Malaya Vishera, Okulovka, and Chudovo. Later on, the railroads between Sonkovo and Saint Petersburg, as well as between Bologoye and Pskov, and a number of connecting lines, were constructed.

On August 1, 1927 the governorates were abolished, and merged into newly established Leningrad Oblast. Between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944, during World War II, western parts of the current area of Novgorod Oblast, including the city of Novgorod, were occupied by German troops. Novgorod Oblast was an area of long and fierce battles, such as, for example, the Demyansk Pocket, or the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive in 1944, when the Soviet troops crossed the Volkhov River. After the liberation, on July 5, 1944, Novgorod Oblast with the center in the city of Novgorod was established.

In 1999, the city of Novgorod was renamed Veliky Novgorod.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Novgorod CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Novgorod Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Novgorod Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

===First secretaries of the Novgorod Oblast CPSU Committee===

===Industry===
As of 2014, industry was responsible for about 40% of the GNP of the oblast. The main industrial enterprises in the oblast are four chemical plants, all located in Veliky Novgorod and specializing mostly in production of fertilizers, a metallurgical plant, also in Veliky Novgorod, producing copper, and a plant in Borovichi producing refractory materials.

===Agriculture===
The main specialization of agriculture in the oblast is cattle breeding with meat and milk production. In 2011, approximately 90% of the farms held cattle, and 79% of all agricultural production in the oblast were meat, milk, and eggs. A number of large-scale farms are keeping pigs and poultry. Bee-keeping, as well as cultivating of crops and potatoes, are also present.

===Transportation===
Novgorod appeared as a site on one of the most important Middle-Age trade routes. The importance of waterways has considerably diminished since those days, but Lake Ilmen, the Volkhov River, and lower courses of main tributaries of lake Ilmen—the Lovat, the Msta, the Polist, and the Shelon, as well as Lake Seliger, remain navigable.

The Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway crosses the oblast from southeast to northwest. The major train stations are Okulovka, Malaya Vishera, and Chudovo. In Chudovo, one railroad branches off south to Veliky Novgorod, and another one north to Volkhovstroy and eventually to Murmansk. Another railway line, connecting Sonkovo and Mga, runs parallel to the first one north of it. A line between Okulovka and Nebolchi makes a connection between the two. Additionally, Veliky Novgorod is connected by railway to Saint Petersburg and Luga. A railway crosses the south of the oblast as well, connecting Bologoye and Pskov via Parfino and Staraya Russa.

The Kushaverskoye peat narrow gauge railway for hauling peat operates in the Khvoyninsky District, and Tyosovo peat narrow gauge railway for hauling peat operates in the Novgorodsky District.

The road network is well developed within the oblast, though only a small number of roads cross borders with Tver Oblast west of Valday and Leningrad Oblast east of Lyubytino. One highway of federal significance, M10, which connects Moscow and Saint Petersburg, crosses the oblast, running through Valday, Kresttsy, and Veliky Novgorod (there is a bypass of Veliky Novgorod). Highways connect Veliky Novgorod with Pskov and with Velikiye Luki, among other destinations.

Novgorod Airport and Krechevitsy Airport are both located around Veliky Novgorod, however, there are no regular passenger flights. Novgorod Airport is basically abandoned.

==Administrative divisions==
The oblast is administratively divided into three cities and towns under the oblast&#x27;s jurisdiction (Veliky Novgorod, Borovichi, and Staraya Russa) and twenty-one districts. Another seven towns (Chudovo, Kholm, Malaya Vishera, Okulovka, Pestovo, Soltsy, and Valday) have the status of the towns of district significance.

==Demographics==
Population: 583,387 (2021 Census), down from 634,111 recorded by the 2010 Census, and further down from about 753,054 recorded in the 1989 Census.

Novgorod Oblast has the lowest population for any oblast in the European part of Russia. One of the reasons for the relatively low population density, particularly the male population, is that the area suffered heavily during World War II. The population is 70.6% urban.

&quot;Ethnic groups&quot;: Novgorod Oblast is relatively homogenous, with only three recognized ethnic groups of more than two thousand persons each at the time of the 2021 Census. In the 2021 Census, the following ethnicities were most numerous: 481,858 Russians (95.4%); 2,931 Ukrainians (0.6%); 2,498 Romani (0.5%); 1,943 Tajiks (0.4%); 1,409 Belarusians (0.3%); 14,308 others. Additionally, 78,440 people were registered from administrative databases, and could not declare an ethnicity. It is estimated that the proportion of ethnic groups in this group is the same as that of the declared group.

Vital statistics for 2024:
*Births: 3,757 (6.6 per 1,000)
*Deaths: 9,059 (15.9 per 1,000)

Total fertility rate (2024):
1.22 children per woman

Life expectancy (2021): 
Total — 67.64 years (male — 62.48, female — 72.80)

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 46.8% of the population of Novgorod Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 4% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1% are Muslims. In addition, 34% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 10% is atheist, and 3.9% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
==Culture and recreation==
Novgorod is one of the oldest Russian cities and was an important part of the Old Rus. Like many Russian cities Novgorod preserved its own local characteristics of traditional Russian culture. Despite great damages, in particular, during World War II, a large amount of medieval monuments of art, archeology, and architecture survive. Many of those are included into the World Heritage site Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings. The majority of them are operated by the Novgorod Museum Reserve. The Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod is the oldest Christian church in Russia with the exception of the Caucasus area. Since Novgorod was not affected by the Mongol invasions, it keeps a fair share of pre-Mongol buildings, most of which are concentrated in the city of Veliky Novgorod and its immediate surroundings. The only pre-Mongol building in Novgorod Oblast outside the Veliky Novgorod agglomeration is the Katholikon of the Transfiguration Cathedral in Staraya Russa, built in the end of the 12th century. Novgorod has, furthermore, a large number of architectural monuments constructed in the 13th–14th centuries, of which the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street is a representative example.

Novgorod developed a distinct school of icon painting, which considerably affected not only the nearby Pskov and the Northern Russia which was dependent on Novgorod, but also in general the old Russian painting. The oldest survived Novgorod icons are dated by the 12th century. Theophanes the Greek, one of the most notable old Russian artists, spent a part of his life in Novgorod, creating, in particular, frescoes in the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street. The East Slavic instrument Gusli was first recorded in the north Russian regions around the era of Novgorodian Rus&#x27;. The oldest Onion domes which became a popular feature of Russian culture and architecture originated among other regions also in Veliky Novgorod.

The archaeological excavations in Novgorod and Staraya Russa unearthed over a thousand of birch bark manuscripts, used mostly to document various business issues. Currently, these manuscripts serve as the main source on the everyday life in the ancient Russia. Many medieval chronicles originate from Novgorod, the first one being the Novgorod First Chronicle, which covers the period between 1016 and 1471. In 14th century the Slavic-Nordic pirates Ushkuiniks spread in the Russian north and later in many other regions of ancient Russia.

After Novgorod was subordinated to Moscow in the end of the 15th century, its cultural significance gradually diminished. However, Valday Iversky Monastery, founded in the 17th century, served as a major cultural center, and in the 18th–19th centuries many important figures of Russian history owned estates in Novgorod Governorate. For example, generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, a Russian military commander notable for military operations against the Ottoman Empire and against the army of Napoleon in the late 18th century, owned the estate of Konchansko-Suvorovskoye, currently in Borovichsky District, and authors Gleb Uspensky and Nikolay Nekrasov owned summer houses in and near Chudovo. In 1862, the Millennium of Russia monument was erected in Novgorod to commemorate the thousand years of Rurik arrival to Novgorod.

== Media ==
In Novgorod Oblast, a local television channel named Novgorod Oblast Television was set up in April 2004.

<text>Saratov Oblast is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located in the Volga Federal District. Its administrative center is the city of Saratov. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 2,442,575.

==Geography==
The oblast is located in the southeast of European Russia, in the northern part of the Lower Volga region. From west to east its territory stretches for , and from north to south for . The highest point of Saratov Oblast is an unnamed hill of the Khvalynsk Mountains reaching above sea level.

The oblast borders on:

* Volgograd Oblast to the south
* Voronezh and Tambov oblasts to the west
* Penza, Samara and Ulyanovsk oblasts to the north;
* Kazakhstan (West Kazakhstan Region) to the east

===Natural resources===
Of particular agricultural importance are valuable agricultural ordinary and southern chernozyom areas; chestnut soils are widespread. The oblast has many water resources: besides the river Volga (which divides the oblast in two) there are many identified sources and mineral-water deposits.

===Minerals===
More than 40 small oil and gas fields have been explored in the region, with the unexplored part of the promising areas being unexplored. Explored a lot of oil shale deposits, including a large Ozinskoye, deposits of quality cement raw materials, phosphorites, construction, ballast and glass sands, construction clay and stone.

===Climate===

The climate in the region is temperate: a long dry hot summer, on the left bank of Volga river a considerable number of days with a temperature above . Winter is frosty, the average number of days with precipitation is 12–15 per month, with fogs an average of 4–10 days per month, With snowstorms – an average of 4–10 days a month. Spring is short. In March, snowstorms, drifts on roads, an average of 5–7 days are possible. Days with fogs in March averaged 5–9. In the spring, usually with the last decade of March to the third decade of April, a limit is imposed on the roads with a hard surface on the movement of heavy vehicles, the beginning of which is timed to the transition of the average daily temperature through 0. Autumn does not differ from year to year by the constancy of the weather. A stable snow cover is created in the northern regions by November 25, and in the central and southern regions – from November 29 to December 8. The region crosses the climatic separating and wind-destroying Voeykov axis, it passes on average through the eastern and northern regions of the region, sometimes falling to the south, and also to the border of the forest and forest-steppe zones, which goes northwards, especially in the spring, which affects the climate of the region.

===Ecology===

The modern ecological state of the Saratov oblast is critical. Intensive pollution of the environment continues as production increases. The fuel, chemical and petrochemical industries are developing more dynamically than the average for Russia. The foreign trade turnover of the Saratov region in 2011 increased by 36.8%. The basis of exports is the products of the fuel and energy and petrochemical complex. Products of machine building continue to be delivered to the countries of the near abroad. Simultaneously with the economic growth of the region, environmental damage is also increasing. To date, the ecological state of the Saratov oblast is not improving. Measures are not taken to stop negative environmental impacts, prevent uncontrolled impacts (such as accidents, uncontrolled emissions, which can lead not only to disasters of a local nature, but also to a larger scale). All marked negative manifestations occur against the background of dangerous natural processes: landslides, karst, earthquakes, flooding. To solve a whole range of environmental problems, the Committee for Environmental Protection and Nature Management of the Saratov oblast developed the &quot;Program for Stabilization and Improvement of the Ecological Situation in the Territory of the Saratov oblast&quot;, which was based on the proposals of the administrations of cities and districts of the region, city district environmental committees, enterprises and organizations Region. The program is financed from budgets of different levels, funds of environmental funds, enterprises and organizations of the region. As a result, the volume of capital expenditures aimed at protecting the environment of the region increased due to all sources of financing. Objects of the public are unknown.

In the dumps and storehouses of enterprises in the Saratov oblast is located 24 million tons of industrial waste:

* 1 class of danger – 3,5 thousand tons; (&quot;Tantalus&quot;, &quot;Banner of Labor&quot;, &quot;SAZ&quot;, &quot;AIT&quot;, &quot;ELMASH&quot;, &quot;SEPO&quot;),
* 2 class of danger – about 5 thousand tons;
* 3 class of danger – about 3 million tons;
* 4 class of danger – about 21 million tons.

In 1998, about 1.5 million tons of industrial wastes of 1–4 hazard classes were formed in the region, about 2 million tons of solid household waste. Compared to 1997, there was a decrease in the gross volume of industrial waste generation by 11%, which is associated with a fall in production volumes.

A particularly dangerous enterprise in Saratov is the AIT plant, which pollutes not only its own territory, but also the adjacent residential area. This enterprise for a long time exported to the dump of the Alexander Village Soviet production waste containing nickel and cadmium.

In dumps in the amount of more than 19 million tons (with a design capacity of 10.84 million tons) phosphogypsum from the production activity of Irgiz OJSC in Balakovo has been accumulated. Here the pollution is tens of times higher than the maximum permissible concentration for phosphates, chlorides, iron, ammonia and nitrates.

One of the most pressing problems is the problem of collection and disposal of technical and domestic garbage. The number of unauthorized landfills is growing. For today, the administrations of municipal entities and the Government of the Saratov oblast are not controlled or monitored in any way. The only measure is a one-time garbage collection in the territories of municipalities, initiated by public organizations of the Saratov region and &quot;subbotniks&quot;, which are held in the spring and autumn.

===Ecological state of the atmosphere===

Annually, Saratov enterprises emit up to 50 million tons of harmful substances into the atmosphere. These include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, heavy metals, ammonia, and atmospheric dust.

The main sources of anthropogenic aerosol air pollution are thermal power plants (CHPs) that consume coal. Combustion of coal, cement production and smelting of cast iron give a total dust emission to the atmosphere equal to 170 million tons per year.

In 2011, Saratov was excluded from the list of Russian cities with very high levels of air pollution.

===Seismic activity===

Historical and modern earthquakes are known in the region. The level of seismic activity in the territory of the region, according to the officially published map of the general seismic zoning of the territory of the Russian Federation (OSR-97-C), is determined by the probability of earthquakes with an intensity of up to 7 points inclusive on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale.

==History==

===Prehistoric period===

By the time of the Paleolithic in the territory of the Saratov oblast are the parking near the village of Aryash Novoburassky district and near the settlement Nepryakhin of the Ozinsky district.

Two male skulls from the cemetery of Khlopkov Bugor belong to the era of the Eneolithic. A single barrow Panitsky 6B in the Krasnoarmeysky district has a dating of the end of the IV – beginning. III millennium BC. By the town Khvalynsk was called the Eneolithic Khvalynsk culture (V-IV thousand BC.).

===Golden Horde and the Kazan Khanate===

In the middle of the 13th century prisoners captured by the Mongols from various conquered countries built one of the first and largest cities of the Golden Horde, Uvek, in the area of modern Saratov (Marco Polo tells of the Venetians visiting the city in 1262). In 1334, the Arab traveler Ibn Battuta visited it and recorded that Ukek is a city of &quot;average size, but beautifully built, with abundant benefits and severe cold&quot;. At the end of the 14th century, the city was destroyed by Tamerlane.

In the next 200 years, a rare population of the Wild Fields was represented by the Nogais, and then by the Kalmyk nomad camps, Cossacks and fishing co-operatives of Russian monasteries. In the meantime, after the collapse of the Golden Horde, the Kazan Khanate was formed on the territory of the Kazan ulus, which in 1552 was conquered by the Russian Tsar Ivan IV.

===Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire===

After the capture of Kazan and the territorial-state reform of Peter I in 1708, the conquered Kazan Khanate became the so-called formally independent Kazan tsardom in union with the Russian State. In 1708 the Kazan tsardom was transformed into the Kazan Governorate. In 1717, the Astrakhan Governorate was separated from it.

On December 25, 1769, the Saratov Province of the Astrakhan Governorate was created. On January 11, 1780 Empress Catherine II issued a decree establishing the Saratov viceregency from the northern districts of the Astrakhan Governorate (Saratov, Khvalynsky, Volsky, Kuznetsky, Serdobsky, Atkarskiy, Petrovsky, Balashov and Kamyshinsky). By decree of Emperor Paul I of December 12, 1796, the Saratov Viceroyalty was abolished, and its counties were divided between the Penza and Astrakhan Governorates.

Between the autumn of 1891 through the summer of 1892, the territory of the Saratov Governorate became part of the main zone of crop failure caused by drought (see Russian famine of 1891–92).

===Soviet Union===

In 1918, part of the territory of the Saratov Governorate was included in the newly formed autonomous region of the Germans in the Volga region. In 1928, the province was disbanded, and its territory became part of the Lower Volga oblast, soon transformed into the Lower Volga krai.

January 10, 1934 the Lower Volga krai was divided into Saratov and Stalingrad krais. According to the Constitution of the USSR, adopted on December 5, 1936, the Saratov krai was reorganized into the Saratov oblast, with the creation of the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

By the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on September 7, 1941, in Saratov oblast were included the territories of 15 cantons of the former Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Balzer, Zolotovsky, Kamensk, Ternovsky, Kukkus, Zelman, Krasnoyarsk, Marksstadt, Untervalden, Fedorov, Gnadenfly, Krasno-Kutsky, Lysanderzhsky, Mariental and Eckheim).

After the abolition of the Balashov oblast by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of November 19, 1957, these cities and districts were returned to the Saratov region. Part of Saratov Region was held by Germany in 1942—3.

===Modern history===
On 4 July 1997, Saratov, alongside Bryansk, Chelyabinsk, Magadan, and Vologda signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement was abolished on 9 February 2002.

==Politics==

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Saratov CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991, the CPSU lost all its power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed or elected alongside elected the regional parliament.

The Charter of Saratov Oblast is the fundamental law of the oblast. The Legislative Assembly of Saratov Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts it passes. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

<text>Rona (), sometimes called South Rona to distinguish it from North Rona (a small uninhabited island to the northwest of Cape Wrath), is an inhabited island in the Inner Hebrides. It lies between the Sound of Raasay and the Inner Sound just north of the neighbouring island of Raasay and east of the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. It has a total area of and a population of 3. 

Rona Lighthouse is situated on the island.

==Geography and geology==
Rona is an extension northward of the ridge of Raasay. Its geology is Lewisian gneiss and the glaciated landscape is underlain by some of the oldest rocks in western Europe.

Writing in the early 18th century, Martin Martin recorded that &quot;this little isle is the most unequal rocky piece of ground to be seen anywhere: there is but very few acres fit for digging, the whole is covered with long heath, erica-baccifera, mertillus, and some mixture of grass; it is reckoned very fruitful in pasturage: most of the rocks consist of the hectic stone, and a considerable part of them is of a red colour.&quot;

On the west side of the island is a secure and picturesque natural anchorage, An Acarsaid Mhòr, protected by the small island of An t-Eilean Garbh. The writer Malcolm Slesser described it as &quot;a delightful little fjord, and superb harbour for small boats. Pink felspar cliffs drop steeply into the water, and small lush woodland lends a touch of luxury.&quot;

Other islets surrounding Rona include Eilean Seamraig, Garbh Eilean (connected to Rona at low tide), Sgeirean Buidhe Bhorlum, and A&#x27; Sgeir Shuas. Eilean Tighe (connected to Raasay at low tide) lies about away across the straits of An Caol Ronaigh, at the centre of which is tiny Fraoich Eilean. The east coast is largely unindented and in addition to Acairseid Mhór the main bays are An Dubh-Chamus (black bay), An Acaarsaid Thioram (dry harbour) and Loch a&#x27; Bhràigheig on the west coast. There are several smaller bays in the north west including Port an Fhearainn (port of the land), Òb nam Feusgan (bay of the mussel), Port na Bà Brice (port of the speckled cow) and Òb an Deallaire (bay of the loiterer). The highest point on the island is Meall na h-Acarseid, which reaches . Sgàth a&#x27; Bhannaich and Beinn na h-Iolaire (hill of the eagle) are further north and are each over high.

== Name ==
Rona&#x27;s name is believed to be of Old Norse origin, from &quot;Hraun-eyer&quot; meaning &quot;rough islands&quot; and probably reflects a Viking settlement. The Gaelic name &quot;Rònaigh&quot; has a similar meaning.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
Between 1999 and 2004 a large scale archaeological project, Scotland&#x27;s First Settlers, was undertaken in the Inner Sound to locate and examine sites relating to the Mesolithic period in the strait. The entire coastline of the Inner Sound together with its islands was walked by volunteers and archaeologists. On Rona they found four caves and rock shelters with evidence of prehistoric habitation. The archaeologists interpreted this to mean that Rona was not as intensively occupied as other parts of the Inner Sound. An aspect they attribute to the lack of fresh water on the island, relative infertility of the landscape and difficulty in accessing the island as there are only two safe landing spots, Big Harbour and Dry Harbour.

===Early historic period===
There are the ruins of a small 14th century chapel at the south end of the island at An Teampull. The structure, probably a monk&#x27;s cell, is enclosed by a wall within which is the island&#x27;s only gravestone. In the 16th century Rona became a refuge for pirates who made a base at An Acarsaid Mhor, then known as &quot;Port nan Robairean&quot; - &quot;port of the robbers&quot;. Murray (1973) presumes that they confined their attacks to foreign vessels as they seem to have been tolerated by the local clan chiefs. One such pirate chief is said to have been Calum Garbh MacLeod, son of a chief of Clan Macleod of Lewis who based himself at Brochail Castle on Raasay in 1518 and used Rona as raiding base.

Writing in 1549, Dean Monro stated: &quot;At the north end of Raarsay, be half myle of sea frae it, layes ane ile callit Ronay, mair then a myle in lengthe, full of wood and heddir, with ane havin for heiland galeys in the middis of it, and the same havein is guyed for fostering of theives, ruggairs, and reivairs, till a nail, upon the peilling and spulzeing of poure pepill. This ile perteins to M.’ Gillychallan of Raarsay by force, and to the bishope of the iles be heritage&quot;.

===Modern era===
Clan MacLeod held the island until the middle of the 19th century. In 1763 the Laird of Raasay is recorded as having kept a cowhand and 160 cattle on the island and in 1787 MacLeod of Raasay explored the opportunities for commercial fishing on the island. He wrote to the Duke of Argyll, then Governor of the British Fisheries Society stating that Rona was:
...one of the most advantageous places on this coast for a fishing station. It is surrounded with numbers of banks which are daily discovered by the country people who come to fish from the mainland, which makes me think there is an inexhaustible fund of them about the island. It is likewise supplied with the best harbours at every creek, both for large vessels and small boats. However his support for the Jacobite cause worked against him and nothing was done. In 1843 Rona and Raasay were sold to George Rainy who began clearing the native population of the latter to make way for sheep.

After the first phase of clearances the population of Rona rose steadily to over 180, the main settlements being at Doire na Guaileadhin the south, An Acarsaid Mhór and An Acarsaid Thioram. Many of the residents were crofting families who had themselves been cleared from more fertile land on Raasay. In May 1921, a group of crofters from Rona landed on Raasay and attempted to re-occupy their ancestral land. These so-called &quot;Raasay Raiders&quot; were arrested, tried and given jail sentences, but public support for them was strong and they were eventually freed and allowed to remain on Raasay. This led in 1922 to the acquisition of both Rona and Raasay from their private landlord by the British Government. After this, the population of Rona fell sharply, as most of the island&#x27;s inhabitants followed the Raiders to settle on Raasay. In 1943 the last crofting family left and the island had become uninhabited, with the exception of the lighthouse keepers who lived at its north end until the lighthouse was automated in 1975.

On the east side of the island is a cave that was used for Sunday worship until the church was built in 1912. It continued to be used sporadically until 1970. The Gaelic name of the cave is &quot;Uamha an Fhuaimhar&quot;. Translated as the &quot;cave of the giant&quot;. Thomas C Lethbridge gives a good description of the cave as it appeared in 1950, still with its stone seats and with the altar at the mouth of the cave. Archaeologists conducted a small test pit excavation in the early 2000s and found evidence of occupation of the cave from at least the Iron Age onwards.

In 1992 Rona was acquired from the government by a Danish owner, who restored Rona Lodge at An Acarsaid Mhór and built a new landing jetty. Rona currently has two permanent residents, the island manager and his wife, who live at Rona Lodge (where B&amp;B and bunkhouse accommodation are available) and also manage the self-catering cottages at An Acarsaid Thioram. Transport to the island is by private charter from Portree. at the north end of the island remain in the hands of the Ministry of Defence and are part of the BUTEC military range.

==Stamps==
Local stamps have been issued for Rona since 2003. The stamps are for visitors to the island who wish to have their mail posted there and carried to the nearest GPO post box on the mainland.

==Wildlife==
Writing in the 1960s, Fraser Darling and Boyd recorded a herd of feral goats on the island and an absence of mice and voles. The goats have now gone but red deer were introduced to the island in 1993 and a fold of Highland cattle from North Uist followed in 1996. Over 300 species of plant have been recorded and in the absence of sheep the native woodland is regenerating.

<text>&quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the March 1947 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; (1986), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990).

&quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; was adapted by for the 1962 ABC Weekend TV anthology television series &quot;Out of This World&quot;, which also marks the first appearance of Susan Calvin, played by Maxine Audley, in TV and movies. It is the only episode of this series that survives in the archives today. It is available on DVD in region 2 from the British Film Institute.

Elements of &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot; appear in the film &quot;I Robot&quot; (2004), an otherwise original story using Asimov&#x27;s brand. The story was broadcast as episode three of a five-part &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; radio adaptation of Asimov&#x27;s stories on BBC Radio 4 in February 2017.

==Plot summary==
At the Hyper Base, a military research station on an asteroid, scientists are working to develop the hyperspace drive - a theme that is explored and developed in several of Asimov&#x27;s stories and mentioned in the Empire and Foundation books. One of the researchers, Gerald Black, loses his temper, swears at an NS-2 (Nestor 10) robot and tells the robot to get lost. Obeying the order literally, it hides itself. It is then up to US Robots&#x27; Chief Robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, and Mathematical Director Peter Bogert, to find it. They even know exactly where it is: in a room with 62 other physically identical robots.

But this particular robot is different. As earlier models on the station had attempted to &quot;rescue&quot; humans from a type of radiation that humans could actually stay in for a while, but would destroy a robot almost immediately, it (and all other NS series robots produced for the station) has had its First Law of Robotics modified to &quot;no robot may injure a human being&quot;; the normal &quot;or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm&quot; has been omitted. Therefore, it could stand by and allow a human to be hurt, as long as it plays no active part in it. In &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot;, the Frankenstein complex is again addressed. The robot must be found because people are still afraid of robots, and if they learned that one had been built with a different First Law, there would be an outcry, even though the robot is still incapable of directly harming a human. However, Dr. Calvin adds further urgency by postulating a situation whereby the altered law &quot;could&quot; allow the robot to harm or even kill a person. The robot could drop a weight on a human below that it knew it could catch before it injured the potential victim. Upon releasing the weight however, its altered programming would allow it to simply let the weight drop, since it would have played no further active part in the resulting injury.

After interviewing every robot separately and going down several blind alleys, Dr. Calvin worries desperately that the robot may be gaining a superiority complex that might allow it to directly hurt a human. Dr. Calvin finds a way to trick the robot into revealing itself: She puts herself in danger but not before ensuring the robots understand that if there is any radiation between herself and the robots, they would be unable to save her even if they tried.

Once the test is run, only the Nestor robot they were looking for makes a move to save her, because it detected harmless infrared rays rather than gamma rays. All of the other robots could not identify what type of radiation was being used because it was not part of their design, whereas the modified NS-2 had been through training at Hyper Base and had learned how to detect the difference in radiation types. The robot, finding itself discovered, then explains that the only way to prove itself better than a human is by never being found, and it tries to attack Dr. Calvin so that she cannot reveal she found the robot. Black and Bogert apply gamma rays on the robot, destroying it before it can harm her.

<text>Abram Fedorovich Ioffe (; – 14 October 1960) was a prominent Soviet physicist. He received the Stalin Prize (1942), the Lenin Prize (1960) (posthumously), and the Hero of Socialist Labor (1955). Ioffe was an expert in various areas of solid state physics and electromagnetism. He established research laboratories for radioactivity, superconductivity, and nuclear physics, many of which became independent institutes.

==Biography==

Ioffe was born into a middle-class Russian Jewish family in the small town of Romny, Russian Empire (now in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine). After graduating from Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology in 1902, he spent two years as an assistant to Wilhelm Röntgen in his Munich laboratory. Ioffe completed his Ph.D. at Munich University in 1905. His dissertation studied the electrical conductivity/electrical stress of dielectric crystals.

After 1906, Ioffe worked in the Saint Petersburg (from 1924 Leningrad) Polytechnical Institute where he eventually became a professor. In 1911 he (independently of Millikan) determined the charge of an electron. In this experiment, the microparticles of zinc metal were irradiated with ultraviolet light to eject the electrons. The charged microparticles were then balanced in an electric field against gravity so that their charges could be determined (published in 1913). In 1911 Ioffe converted from Judaism to Lutheranism and married a non-Jewish woman. In 1913 he attained the title of Magister of Philosophy and in 1915 Doctor of Physics. In 1918 he became head of Physics and Technology division in State Institute of Roentgenology and Radiology. This division became the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute (LPTI) in 1917 and eventually the Ioffe Institute.

In the early 1930s, there was a critical need in the Air Defense Forces of the Red Army for means of detecting invading aircraft. A number of research institutes were involved with &quot;radiolokatory&quot; (radio-location) techniques. The Russian Academy of Sciences called a conference in January 1934 to assess this technology. Ioffe organized this conference, then published a journal report, disclosing to researchers throughout the world the science and technology that would ultimately be called radar.
When the Soviet atomic bomb project began in 1942, Ioffe was asked to lead the technical effort, but refused the job on the grounds that he was too old. He saw great promise in the young Igor Kurchatov, and placed him in charge of the first nuclear laboratory. During Joseph Stalin&#x27;s campaign against the so-called &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; (Jews), in 1950 Ioffe was made redundant from his position of the Director of LPTI and from the board of directors. In 1952–1954 he headed the Laboratory of Semiconductors of Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which in 1954 was reorganized as the Institute of Semiconductors. Following Ioffe&#x27;s death, in 1960 the LPTI was renamed the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute and is one of Russia&#x27;s leading research centers.

Ioffe&#x27;s students include Aleksandr Aleksandrov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Pyotr Lukirsky, Isaak Kikoin, Igor Kurchatov, Yakov Frenkel, Nikolay Semyonov, Léon Theremin, Boris Davydov, and Lev Artsimovich. Ioffe asked Ernest Rutherford to accept Pyotr Kapitsa to Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

<text>&quot;Escape!&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published as &quot;Paradoxical Escape&quot; (a publisher&#x27;s change in the title) in the August 1945 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted as &quot;Escape!&quot; (Asimov&#x27;s choice of title) in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982).

==Plot summary==
Many research organizations are working to develop the hyperspatial drive. The company U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., is approached by its biggest competitor that has plans for a working hyperspace engine that allows humans to survive the jump (a theme which would be further developed in future Asimov stories). But the staff of U.S. Robots is wary, because, in performing the calculations, their rival&#x27;s (non-positronic) supercomputer has destroyed itself.

U.S. Robots finds a way to feed the information to its own positronic computer known as &quot;The Brain&quot; (which is not a robot in the strictest sense of the word, since it does not move, although it does obey the Three Laws of Robotics), without the same thing happening.

&quot;The Brain&quot; then directs the building of a hyperspace ship. Powell and Donovan board the spaceship, which takes off without them being initially aware of it. They find that &quot;The Brain&quot; has become a practical joker: the ship lacks manual controls, amenities such as showers and beds, and food aside from canned beans and milk.

Shortly after their journey begins, and after many strange visions by the crew, the ship safely returns to Base after two hyperspace jumps. By then, Dr. Susan Calvin has discovered what happened: any hyperspace jump causes the crew of the ship to cease existing for a brief moment, effectively dying, which is a violation of the First Law of Robotics (albeit a temporary one); the only reason the artificial intelligence of &quot;The Brain&quot; survived is because Susan reduced the importance of the potential deaths, and descending into irrational, childish behavior (as a means of coping) allows it to find a means for ensuring the survival of the crew.

<text>Mark Ivor Satin (born November 16, 1946) is an American political theorist, writer, and newsletter publisher. He is best known for contributing to the development and dissemination of three political perspectives – neopacifism in the 1960s, New Age politics in the 1970s and 1980s, and radical centrism in the 1990s and 2000s. Satin&#x27;s work is sometimes seen as building toward a new political ideology, and then it is often labeled &quot;transformational&quot;, &quot;post-liberal&quot;, or &quot;post-Marxist&quot;. One historian calls Satin&#x27;s writing &quot;post-hip&quot;.

After emigrating to Canada at the age of 20 to avoid serving in the Vietnam War, Satin co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, which helped bring American war resisters to Canada. He also wrote the &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; (1968), which sold nearly 100,000 copies. After a period that author Marilyn Ferguson describes as Satin&#x27;s &quot;anti-ambition experiment&quot;, Satin wrote &quot;New Age Politics&quot; (1978), which identifies an emergent &quot;third force&quot; in North America pursuing such goals as simple living, decentralism, and global responsibility. Satin spread his ideas by co-founding an American political organization, the New World Alliance, and by publishing an international political newsletter, &quot;New Options&quot;. He also co-drafted the foundational statement of the U.S. Green Party, &quot;Ten Key Values&quot;.

Following a period of political disillusion, spent mainly in law school and practicing business law, Satin launched a new political newsletter and wrote a book, &quot;Radical Middle&quot; (2004). Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning and innovative policy syntheses across social and cultural divides. In an interview, Satin contrasts the old radical slogan &quot;Dare to struggle, dare to win&quot; with his radical-middle version, &quot;Dare to synthesize, dare to take it all in&quot;.

Satin has been described as &quot;colorful&quot; and &quot;intense&quot;, and all his initiatives have been controversial. Bringing war resisters to Canada was opposed by many in the anti-Vietnam War movement. &quot;New Age Politics&quot; was not welcomed by many on the traditional left or right, and &quot;Radical Middle&quot; dismayed an even broader segment of the American political community. Even Satin&#x27;s personal life has generated controversy. At age 76, Satin wrote a book seeking to draw lessons from his political and personal journey, &quot;Up From Socialism: My 60-Year Search for a Healing New Radical Politics&quot; (2023).

== Early years ==
Many mid-1960s American radicals came from small cities in the Midwest and Southwest, as did Satin: he grew up in Moorhead, Minnesota, and Wichita Falls, Texas. His father, who saw combat in World War II, was a college professor and author of a Cold War-era textbook on Western civilization. His mother was a homemaker.

As a youth, Satin was restless and rebellious, and his behavior did not change after leaving for university. In early 1965, at age 18, he dropped out of the University of Illinois to work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Later that year, he was told to leave Midwestern State University, in Texas, for refusing to sign a loyalty oath to the United States Constitution. In 1966 he became president of a Students for a Democratic Society chapter at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and helped recruit nearly 20% of the student body to join. One term later he dropped out, then emigrated to Canada to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.

Just before Satin left for Canada, his father told him he was trying to destroy himself. His mother told the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; she could not condone her son&#x27;s actions. Satin says he arrived in Canada feeling bewildered and unsupported. According to press accounts, many Vietnam War resisters arrived feeling much the same way.

== Neopacifism, 1960s ==
=== Toronto Anti-Draft Programme ===
As 1967 began, many American pacifists and radicals did not look favorably on emigration to Canada as a means of resisting the Vietnam War. For some this reflected a core conviction that effective war resistance requires self-sacrifice. For others it was a matter of strategy – emigration was said to be less useful than going to jail
or deserting the military, or was said to abet the war by siphoning off the opposition. At first, Students for a Democratic Society and many Quaker draft counselors opposed promoting the Canadian alternative, and Canada&#x27;s largest counseling group, the Anti-Draft Programme of the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA) – whose board consisted largely of Quakers and radicals – was sympathetic to such calls for prudence. In January 1967 its spokesman warned an American audience that immigration was difficult and that the Programme was not willing to act as &quot;baby sitters&quot; for Americans after they arrived. He added that he was tired of talking to the press.

When Mark Satin was hired as director of the Programme in April 1967, he attempted to change its culture. He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration. His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, with largely the same board of directors, in October 1967. Instead of praising self-sacrifice, he emphasized the importance of self-preservation and self-development to social change. Rather than sympathizing with pacifists&#x27; and radicals&#x27; strategic concerns, he rebutted them, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that massive emigration of draft-age Americans could help end the war, and telling another reporter that going to jail was bad public relations.

Where the Programme once publicized the difficulties of immigration, Satin emphasized the competence of his draft counseling operation, and even told of giving cash to immigrants who were without funds.
Instead of refusing to &quot;baby sit&quot; Americans after they arrived, Satin made post-emigration assistance a top priority. The office soon sported comfortable furniture, a hot plate, and free food; within a few months, 200 Torontonians had opened their homes to war resisters and a job-finding service had been established. Finally, rather than expressing indifference to reporters, Satin courted them, and many responded, beginning with a May 1967 article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; that included a large picture of Satin counseling Vietnam War resisters in the refurbished office. Some of the publicity focused on Satin as much as on his cause. According to historian Pierre Berton, Satin was so visible that he became the unofficial spokesman for war resisters in Canada.

Satin defined himself as a neopacifist or quasi-pacifist – flexible, media-savvy, and entrepreneurial. He told one journalist he might have fought against Hitler. He was not necessarily opposed to the draft, telling reporters he would support it for a defensive army or to help eliminate poverty, illiteracy, and racial discrimination. He avoided the intellectual framework of traditional pacifism and socialism. Sometimes he spoke with emotion, as when he described the United States to &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; as &quot;[t]hat godawful sick, foul country; could anything be worse?&quot; Sometimes he spoke poetically, as when he told author Jules Witcover, &quot;It&#x27;s colder here, but you feel warm because you know you&#x27;re not trying to kill people.&quot; Instead of identifying with older pacifists, he identified with a 17-year-old character from the pen of J. D. Salinger: &quot;I was Holden Caulfield&quot;, he said in 2008, &quot;just standing and catching in the rye.&quot;

The results of Satin&#x27;s approach were noticeable: the Programme went from averaging fewer than three visitors, letters, and phone calls per day just before he arrived, to averaging 50 per day nine months later. In addition, the American anti-war movement became more accepting of emigration to Canada – for example, author Myra MacPherson reports that Satin&#x27;s &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; could be obtained at every draft counseling office in the U.S. However, Satin&#x27;s approach was distressing to the traditional pacifists and socialists on the Programme&#x27;s board. The board clashed with Satin over at least 10 political, strategic, and performance issues. The most intractable may have been over the extent of the publicity. There were also concerns about Satin&#x27;s personal issues; for example, one war resister claims to have heard him say, &quot;Anonymity would kill me&quot;. In May 1968, the board finally fired him.

=== &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; ===
Before Satin was fired, he conceived and wrote, and edited guest chapters for, the &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot;, published in January 1968 by the House of Anansi Press in partnership with the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme. The Programme had issued brochures on emigration before – including a 12-page version under Satin&#x27;s watch – but the &quot;Manual&quot; was different, a comprehensive, 45,000-word book, and it quickly turned into an &quot;underground bestseller&quot;. Many years later, Toronto newspapers reported that nearly 100,000 copies of the &quot;Manual&quot; had been sold. One journalist calls it the &quot;first entirely Canadian-published bestseller in the United States&quot;.

The Programme was initially hesitant about producing the &quot;Manual&quot;, which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it. &quot;The [board] didn&#x27;t even want me to write it&quot;, Satin says. &quot;I wrote it at night, in the SUPA office, three or four nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day – pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA&#x27;s ancient Underwood typewriter.&quot; When it finally appeared, some leading periodicals helped put it on the map. For example, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; called it &quot;useful&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it contains advice about everything from how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs, housing, schools, politics, culture, and even the snow. After the war, sociologist John Hagan found that more than a third of young American emigrants to Canada had read the &quot;Manual&quot; while still in the United States, and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived.

The &quot;Manual&quot; reflected Satin&#x27;s neopacifist politics. Commentators routinely characterized it as caustic, responsible, and supportive. The first part of the &quot;Manual&quot;, on emigration, suggests that self-preservation is more important than sacrifice to a dubious cause. The second half, on Canada, spotlights opportunities for self-development and social innovation. According to Canadian social historian David Churchill, the &quot;Manual&quot; helped some Canadians begin to see Toronto as socially inclusive, politically progressive, and counter-cultural.

Inevitably, the &quot;Manual&quot; became a lightning rod for controversy. Some observers took issue with its perspective on Canada; most notably, &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature&quot; criticizes its &quot;condescending tone&quot; in describing Canada&#x27;s resources. Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the &quot;Manual&quot;. According to journalist Lynn Coady, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press&#x27;s offices. In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. Many people did not want the Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the &quot;Manual&quot; encouraged emigration. But few observers believed him, then or later. The first sentence of an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1968 describes the &quot;Manual&quot; as &quot;a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription&quot;. Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the &quot;Manual&quot; as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the &quot;Manual&quot; is &quot;coyly titled&quot;.

Satin was fired from the Programme soon after the appearance of the second edition of the &quot;Manual&quot;, which had a print run of 20,000. His name was removed from the title page of most subsequent editions. According to a study of the &quot;Manual&quot; by critic Joseph Jones in &quot;Canadian Notes &amp; Queries&quot;, a literary journal, some later editions experienced a falloff in quality. Nevertheless, Jones says the &quot;Manual&quot; stands as an icon of its age. It made significant appearances in at least five 20th-century novels, including John Irving&#x27;s &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, and it continues to be pored over by journalists,
historians, social scientists, creative writers, social movement strategists, and graduate students. In 2017 the &quot;Manual&quot; was re-issued as a Canadian &quot;classic&quot; by the original publisher, with an introduction by Canadian historian James Laxer and a politically charged afterword by Satin, then in his 70th year.

=== &quot;Confessions of a Young Exile&quot; ===

Until the 1990s, literary critic William Zinsser says, memoir writers tended to conceal their most personal and embarrassing memories. In the 1970s Satin wrote a book revealing many such memories as a neopacifist activist during the years 1964–66, &quot;Confessions of a Young Exile&quot;, published by Gage, a Toronto publishing house soon to merge with Macmillan of Canada. &quot;Confessions&quot; is &quot;a remarkable exercise in self-exposure&quot;, playwright John Lazarus says in a review. &quot;The insights into the hero&#x27;s motives and fears are so honest, and so mortifyingly true, that it soon becomes evident that the [naive] tone is deliberate.&quot;

To some reviewers, Satin appears to have had a political goal – encouraging activists to establish common ground with ordinary North Americans on the basis of their shared confusion and humanity. For example, Jackie Hooper, writing in &quot;The Province&quot;, argues that the purity of motives projected by many pacifist activists is unconvincing, and recommends Satin&#x27;s more complex view: &quot;Satin&#x27;s emigration wasn&#x27;t dictated totally by his idealism. More often than not, he talked himself into radical positions ... as a result of trying to impress his peers or his girlfriend, or rebelling against middle-class parental authority&quot;. Roy MacSkimming, book editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, says Satin portrayed himself as &quot;idealistic&quot; but also troubled and uncertain, wanting to fit in yet also longing to be unique.

Some reviewers were unenthusiastic. For example, Dennis Duffy, writing in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, describes Satin&#x27;s memoir as a &quot;story about a young man who doesn&#x27;t grow up&quot;. In addition, Satin&#x27;s publisher began having reservations about him. Many years later, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that the publisher decided not to let Satin do any publicity for the book, because of his potentially offensive views.

In the 21st century, &quot;Confessions&quot; was discussed at length by literary critics Rachel Adams in the &quot;Yale Journal of Criticism&quot; and Robert McGill in his book &quot;War Is Here&quot;. Both had been drawn to Satin&#x27;s text because of their interest in the figure of the &quot;draft dodger&quot; in literature, and both depict Satin&#x27;s journey from Moorhead to Canada as politically complex and sexually charged.

== New Age politics, 1970s – 1980s ==
=== &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, the book ===
As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, and many movements arose in its wake – among them the feminist, men&#x27;s liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or as a reporter for Canada&#x27;s underground press. He also took up residence in a free-love commune. &quot;One fierce winter&#x27;s day&quot;, he says, &quot;... it dawned on me that the ideas and energies from the various &#x27;fringe&#x27; movements [were] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)&quot;. Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of &quot;New Age Politics&quot; himself, in 1976. A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver&#x27;s Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the &quot;first&quot;, &quot;most ambitious&quot;, or &quot;most adequate&quot; attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising in the wake of the New Left. Some academics say it offers a new ideology.
At the heart of &quot;New Age Politics&quot; is a critique of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a &quot;six-sided prison&quot; that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years. The six sides of the &quot;prison&quot; are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the &quot;big city outlook&quot; (fear of nature). Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for &quot;monolithic&quot; institutions that offer us little in the way of freedom of choice or connection with others. Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.

To explain how to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin develops a &quot;psychocultural&quot; class analysis that reveals the existence of &quot;life-&quot;, &quot;thing-&quot;, and &quot;death-oriented&quot; classes. According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging &quot;third force&quot; in post-industrial nations. The third force is generating a &quot;prison-free&quot; consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force is going to have to launch an &quot;evolutionary movement&quot; to replace – or at least supplement – monolithic institutions with life-affirming, &quot;biolithic&quot; ones. Some representative biolithic institutions are: deliberative democracy as an alternative to bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization – not capitalism – is said to be responsible for the prison. But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.

The reaction to &quot;New Age Politics&quot; was, and continues to be, highly polarized. Many of the movements Satin drew upon to construct his synthesis received it favorably, though some took exception to the title. Some maverick liberals and libertarians are drawn to the book. It was eventually published in Sweden and Germany, and European New Age political thinkers came to see it as a precursor of their own work. Others see it as proto-Green. Ever since its first appearance, though, and continuing into the 21st century, &quot;New Age Politics&quot; has been a target of criticism for two groups in the United States: conservative Christians and left-wing intellectuals.

Among conservative Christians, there are cultural, political, and moral objections. Attorney Constance Cumbey warns that the book can be &quot;seductive&quot; to those who lack an adequate Biblical education. Theologians Tim LaHaye and Ron Rhodes are convinced Satin wants a centralized and coercive world government. Moral philosopher Douglas Groothuis says Satin&#x27;s vision is unsound because it lacks an absolute standard of good and evil. Among left-leaning academics, criticism focuses on Satin&#x27;s theoretical underpinnings. Political scientist Michael Cummings takes issue with the idea that consciousness is ultimately determining. Science-and-society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to psychocultural class analysis. A lengthy, systemic critique of &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, by communication studies professor Dana L. Cloud, accuses it of employing a &quot;therapeutic rhetoric[] generated to console activists after the failure of post-1968 revolutionary movements and to legitimate participation in liberal politics&quot;.

=== Organizing the New World Alliance ===

After U.S. President Jimmy Carter pardoned
Vietnam War resisters in 1977, Satin began giving talks on &quot;New Age Politics&quot; in the United States. His first talk received a standing ovation, and he wept. Every talk seemed to lead to two or three more, and &quot;the response at New Age gatherings, community events, fairs, bookstores, living rooms, and college campuses&quot; kept Satin going for two years. By the second year he began laying the groundwork for the New World Alliance, a national political organization based in Washington, D.C. &quot;I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast&quot;, he told the authors of the book &quot;Networking&quot;. &quot;I stopped when I found 500 [accomplished] people who said they&#x27;d answer a questionnaire ... on what a New Age-oriented political organization should be like – what its politics should be, what its projects should be, and how its first directors should be chosen.&quot;.

The New World Alliance convened its first &quot;governing council&quot; meeting in New York City in 1979. The 39-member council was chosen by the questionnaire-answerers themselves, out of 89 who volunteered to be on the ballot. Political scientist Arthur Stein describes the council as an eclectic collection of educators, feminists, businesspeople, futurists, think-tank fellows, and activists. One of the council&#x27;s announced goals was to break down the division between left and right. Another was to help facilitate a thorough transformation of society. Satin was named staff member of the Alliance.

Expectations ran high among supporters of a post-liberal, post-Marxist politics, and the governing council did initiate several projects. For example, a series of &quot;Political Awareness Seminars&quot; attempted to help participants understand and learn to work with their political opponents. In addition, a &quot;Transformation Platform&quot; attempted to synthesize left- and right-wing approaches to dozens of public policy issues. But within three years the Alliance fell apart, unable to establish stable chapters in any major cities. Author Jerome Clark suggests the cause was the Alliance&#x27;s commitment to consensus-building in all its groups and projects; within months, he notes, one member was complaining that the Alliance had turned into a &quot;diddler&#x27;s cult&quot;. Another explanation focuses on the failure – or inability – of the hyper-democratic questionnaire process to select an appropriate governing council.

Satin was devastated by the decline of the Alliance, and engaged in unhappy bouts of public criticism and self-criticism. &quot;We would rather be good than do good&quot;, he told editor Kevin Kelly. &quot;We would rather be pure than mature. We are the Beautiful Losers.&quot; As time went on, though, the Alliance came to be regarded positively by many observers. For example, author Corinne McLaughlin sees it as one of the first groups to offer an agenda for the new transformational politics. In an academic text, political scientist Stephen Woolpert acknowledges it as a precursor of North American Green parties.

=== &quot;New Options Newsletter&quot; ===
After four or five New World Alliance governing council meetings, Satin became tired of what he saw as empty rhetoric, and decided to do something practical – start a political newsletter. He raised $91,000 to launch the venture, from 517 people he had met on his travels, and within a few years had built it into what think-tank scholar George Weigel described as &quot;one of the hottest political newsletters in Washington[, D.C.]. ... [It] has gotten a fair amount of [national] attention, and perhaps even some influence, because it self-consciously styles itself &#x27;post-liberal&#x27;.&quot; Satin published 75 issues of &quot;New Options&quot; from 1984 to 1992, virtually half a million words. He wrote nearly all the articles. In 1989 &quot;New Options&quot; received &quot;Utne Reader&quot;&#x27;s first &quot;Alternative Press Award for General Excellence: Best Publication from 10,000 to 30,000 Circulation&quot;. In 1990 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; identified &quot;New Options&quot; as one of 10 periodicals spearheading &quot;The Ideology Shuffle&quot;. Twenty-five of its articles were published as a book by a university press.
Satin wanted &quot;New Options&quot; to make the visionary perspective of &quot;New Age Politics&quot; seem pragmatic and realizable. He also wanted &quot;New Options&quot; to spread the New Age political ideology more effectively than the New World Alliance had done. To those ends, he challenged traditional views across the political spectrum, and he expanded the scope of politics to include subjects like love and relationships. In her book &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot;, culture critic Annie Gottlieb says &quot;New Options&quot; offered:
an explosive short course in political possibility. ... What are the best books and groups in the consumer empowerment (not &quot;protection&quot;) and neighborhood self-reliance movements? Who is working on practical, compassionate, populist alternatives to the welfare state and the big-business state? What is the best way to cut the budget deficit? What can we learn from the Sri Lankan Sarvodaya (local self-help) and Polish Solidarity movements? Each issue presents ideas, names and addresses, and a crossfire of reader debate.
&quot;I think the reason &quot;New Options&quot; works is it has a particular tone&quot;, Satin told one reporter. &quot;It&#x27;s as idealistic as many of us were in the 1960s, but ... without the childishness&quot;.

&quot;New Options&quot; owed its rise to more than just content and tone, however. Positioning was also a factor. The New Age political movement was cresting in the 1980s, and it needed a political periodical. Satin&#x27;s book &quot;New Age Politics&quot; had helped define the movement, and the &quot;New Options&quot; advisory board – a collection of prominent post-liberal thinkers – gave the newsletter further credibility. At the outset it included Lester R. Brown, Ernest Callenbach, Fritjof Capra, Vincent Harding, Willis Harman, Hazel Henderson, Petra Kelly, Amory Lovins, Joanna Macy, Robin Morgan, John Naisbitt, Jeremy Rifkin, Carl Rogers, Theodore Roszak, Kirkpatrick Sale, Charlene Spretnak, and Robert Theobald, and over the years it added such figures as Herman Daly, Marilyn Ferguson, Jane Jacobs, Winona LaDuke, and Robert Rodale.

&quot;New Options&quot; did not succeed in all quarters. Jules Feiffer, for example, often seen as being on the liberal-left, called it &quot;irritating&quot; and &quot;neo-yuppie&quot;. Jason McQuinn, often seen as a radical,
objected to what he perceived as its relentless American optimism. George Weigel, often seen as a conservative, said it consisted largely of a cleverly repackaged leftism. Satin himself turned out to be one of the newsletter&#x27;s critics. &quot;I could have edited &quot;New Options&quot; forever&quot;, he wrote in 2004. &quot;But, increasingly, I was becoming dissatisfied with my hyper-idealistic politics&quot;. His experiences in the U.S. Green politics movement contributed to that dissatisfaction.

=== &quot;Ten Key Values&quot; of the U.S. Green Party ===
By the mid-1980s, Green parties were making inroads all over the world. A slogan of the West German Greens was, &quot;We are neither left nor right; we are in front&quot;. Some observers, notably British Green Party liaison Sara Parkin, saw the New World Alliance and &quot;New Options Newsletter&quot; as Green entities. Others saw the early Greens as one expression of New Age politics. In 1984, Satin was invited to the founding meeting of the U.S. Green politics movement, and he became a founding member.
The meeting chose him, along with political theorist Charlene Spretnak, to draft its foundational political statement, &quot;Ten Key Values&quot;. Some accounts recognize futurist and activist Eleanor LeCain as a co-equal drafter. The drafters drew on suggestions recorded on a flip chart during a marathon plenary brainstorming session, as well as on suggestions received by Satin and Spretnak during the meeting and for many weeks afterward.

The original &quot;Ten Key Values&quot; statement was approved by the Greens&#x27; national steering committee and released in late 1984. The values in the original statement are: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal and Social Responsibility, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Postpatriarchal Values, Respect for Diversity, Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. One unusual aspect, say many observers, is the way the values are described; instead of declaratory statements full of &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musts&quot;, each value is followed by a series of open-ended questions. &quot;That idea ... came from Mark Satin&quot;, Spretnak told scholar Greta Gaard in 1997. Its effect, says sociologist Paul Lichterman, was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S.

The original values statement was, and remains, controversial. U.S. Green Party co-founder John Rensenbrink credits it with helping to unify the often contentious Greens. However, party co-founder Howie Hawkins sees it as just a watered-down, &quot;spiritual&quot;, and &quot;New Age&quot; version of the German Greens&#x27; Four Pillars statement. Greta Gaard says it fails to call for the elimination of capitalism or racism. Looking back after 20 years, Green activist Brian Tokar said that &quot;the voice of the original [values] questions is distinctly personal ... and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms.&quot; A &quot;modified&quot; list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens&#x27; political platform. However, all the open-ended questions were replaced by declaratory sentences, and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left, rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right.

Satin himself became increasingly critical of the Greens. He gave a featured speech at the U.S. Green gathering in 1987 urging them to avoid hyper-detailed platform writing and other projects and specialize in one thing – running people for office who endorse the Ten Key Values. But the speech failed to persuade. After the Green gathering in 1989, he urged them to abandon hippie-era fears of money, authority, and leadership. After the 1990 gathering he complained &quot;I&#x27;ve been Pure before,&quot; an allusion to his time in the New World Alliance. According to Greta Gaard, he then bid farewell to the Greens, but recognized it as a loss: &quot;Whatever I may think of their internal battles and political prospects, the Greens are My People. Their life choices are my life choices; their failings mirror my own.&quot; Within a year of voicing those words, he stopped &quot;New Options Newsletter&quot; and applied to law school.

== Radical centrist politics, 1990s – 2000s ==
=== &quot;Radical Middle Newsletter&quot; ===
The 1990s are remembered, by many in the West, as a time of relative prosperity and satisfaction. According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. &quot;I knew my views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition&quot;, he wrote.
After graduating in 1995, Satin worked for a Manhattan law firm focusing on complex business litigation. He also wrote about financial and legal issues. He did not dislike his work, but felt he was &quot;sleepwalking&quot; because he was not doing what he loved, writing about visionary politics. With six former law school classmates, he began planning a political newsletter that could accommodate all he was learning about business and law. In 1998 he returned to Washington, D.C., to launch &quot;Radical Middle Newsletter&quot;.

As the title indicates, it sought to distance itself from New Age politics. If the term &quot;New Age&quot; suggests utopianism, the term &quot;radical middle&quot; suggests, for Satin and others, keeping at least one foot firmly on the ground. Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term. One feature story is entitled &quot;Tough on Terrorism, and Tough on the Causes of Terrorism&quot;. Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology. Another argues that corporate activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic, but as a &quot;chance for mutual learning&quot;. The board of advisors of &quot;Radical Middle Newsletter&quot; signaled Satin&#x27;s new direction. It was politically diverse, and many of its members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides. By the end of 2004 it included John Avlon, Don Edward Beck, Jerry H. Bentley, Esther Dyson, Mark P. Painter, Shelley Alpern of the Social Investment Forum, James Fallows of the New America Foundation, Jane Mansbridge of the Harvard Kennedy School, John D. Marks and Susan Collin Marks of Search for Common Ground, and William Ury, co-author of &quot;Getting to Yes&quot;.

&quot;Radical Middle Newsletter&quot; proved controversial. Many responded positively to Satin&#x27;s new direction. A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin&#x27;s former newsletter, &quot;Radical Middle&quot; spoke about &quot;reality&quot;. Scholarly books began citing articles from the newsletter. In a book on globalization, Walter Truett Anderson said &quot;Radical Middle&quot; &quot;carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is &#x27;nuanced, hopeful, adult&#x27;. ... It is essentially a willingness to listen to both sides of the argument.&quot; But three objections were often heard. Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar Michael N. Nagler wrote that the article &quot;praising humanitarian military intervention as the &#x27;peace movement&#x27; of our time, is nothing short of an insult ... to the &quot;real&quot; peace movement&quot; [emphasis in original]. Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former &quot;New Options&quot; advisor David Korten chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. There were also accusations of elitism, as when the executive editor of &quot;Yes!&quot; magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his &quot;law school buddies&quot;.

&quot;New Options Newsletter&quot; was based on the theories set forth in &quot;New Age Politics&quot;. But Satin&#x27;s approach to his radical middle project was eclectic and experimental. His contribution to radical centrist political theory, the book &quot;Radical Middle&quot;, was not published until 2004, the newsletter&#x27;s sixth year. Until then, the only glimpse Satin gave of his larger vision appeared in an article he wrote for an academic journal.

=== &quot;Radical Middle&quot;, the book ===
Satin&#x27;s book &quot;Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now&quot;, published by Westview Press and Basic Books in 2004, attempts to present radical centrism as a political ideology. It is considered one of the two or three &quot;most persuasive&quot; or most representative books on the subject, and it received the &quot;Best Book Award&quot; for 2003 and 2004 from the Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics of the American Political Science Association. It also generated – like all of Satin&#x27;s works – criticism and controversy.
Satin presents &quot;Radical Middle&quot; as a revised and evolved version of his &quot;New Age Politics&quot; book, rather than as a rejection of it. Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the &quot;Radical Center&quot;. In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a &quot;New Center&quot;. But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, he defines radical middle politics as &quot;idealism without illusions&quot; – more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face &quot;the hard facts on the ground&quot;. Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middle – &quot;we&#x27;re very practical folks, and we&#x27;re very idealistic and visionary as well.&quot;

Although Satin argues in &quot;New Age Politics&quot; that Americans need to change their consciousness and decentralize their institutions, in &quot;Radical Middle&quot; he says they can build a good society if they adopt and live by Four Key Values: maximize choices for all Americans, give every American a fair start, maximize every American&#x27;s human potential, and help the peoples of the developing world. Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively. He calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle&#x27;s favorite Founding Father, and says Franklin &quot;wanted us to invent a uniquely American politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view.&quot;

In &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, Satin chooses not to focus on the details of public policy. In &quot;Radical Middle&quot;, however, Satin develops a raft of policy proposals rooted in the Four Key Values. (Among them: universal access to private, preventive health insurance, class-based rather than race-based affirmative action, mandatory national service, and opening U.S. markets to more products from poor nations.) In &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, Satin calls on &quot;life-oriented&quot; people to become radical activists for a New Age society. In &quot;Radical Middle&quot;, Satin calls on people of every political stripe to work from within for social change congruent with the Four Key Values.

Satin&#x27;s mandatory national service proposal drew significant media coverage, in part because of his status as a draft refuser. Satin argues that a draft could work in the United States if it applied to all young people, without exception, and if it gave everyone a choice in how they would serve. He proposes three service options: military (with generous benefits), homeland security (at prevailing wages), and community care (at subsistence wages). On Voice of America radio, Satin presented his proposal as one drawing equally from the best of the left and the right. On National Public Radio, he emphasized its fairness.

&quot;Radical Middle&quot; provokes three kinds of responses: skeptical, pragmatic, and visionary. Skeptical respondents tend to find Satin&#x27;s beyond-left-and-right policy proposals to be unrealistic and arrogant. For example, political writer Charles R. Morris says &quot;Satin&#x27;s nostrums&quot; echo the &quot;glibness and overweening self-confidence ... in Roosevelt&#x27;s brain trust, or in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s.&quot; Similarly, the policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council says Satin&#x27;s book &quot;ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of &#x27;idealistic&#x27; American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything.&quot;

Pragmatic observers tend to applaud Satin&#x27;s willingness to borrow good ideas from the left and the right. But these respondents are typically more drawn to Satin as a policy advocate – or as a counterweight to partisan militants like Ann Coulter – than they are to him as a political theorist. For example, Robert Olson of the World Future Society warns Satin against presenting the radical middle as a new ideology.

Visionary respondents typically appreciate Satin&#x27;s work as a policy advocate. But they also see him as attempting something rarer and, according to spiritual writer Carter Phipps, richer – raising politics to a higher level by synthesizing truths from all the political ideologies. Author Corinne McLaughlin identifies Satin as one of those creating an ideology about ideologies. She quotes him:
Coming up with a solution is not a matter of adopting correct political beliefs. It is, rather, a matter of learning to listen – really, listen – to everyone in the circle of humanity, and to take their insights into account. For everyone has a true and unique perspective on the whole. [Many] years ago the burning question was, How radical are you? Hopefully someday soon the question will be, How much can you synthesize? How much do you dare to take in?

== Later life ==
Life changed for Satin after writing and publicizing his &quot;Radical Middle&quot; book. In 2006, at the age of 60, he moved from Washington, D.C., to the San Francisco Bay Area to reconcile with his father, from whom he had been estranged for 40 years. &quot;With the perspective of time and experience,&quot; Satin told one reporter, &quot;I can see [my father] was not altogether out to lunch.&quot; Later that year Satin discovered his only life partner. He describes it as &quot;no accident&quot;.

In 2009 Satin revealed he was losing his eyesight as a result of macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. He stopped producing &quot;Radical Middle Newsletter&quot; but expressed a desire to write a final political book. From 2009 to 2011 he presented occasional guest lectures on &quot;life and political ideologies&quot; in peace studies classes at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2015 he helped produce a &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot; of his book &quot;New Age Politics&quot;, and in 2017 he helped produce a 50th anniversary edition of his &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot;.

=== &quot;Up From Socialism&quot; ===

In his mid-70s, Satin wrote the book &quot;Up From Socialism&quot; (2023). It was edited by Adam Bellow, a son of the novelist Saul Bellow. Shortly after publication, Satin described what he saw as the book&#x27;s political perspective on the Civil Rights Movement Archive website: &quot;[In my new book], radical politics no longer means taking an extreme side of an issue and acting as if you&#x27;re right and everyone else is wrong (or, especially today, &#x27;evil&#x27;). Rather, it means listening empathically to the fears, needs, wants, and wisdom of people on all sides of an issue, and then working with all sides to develop genuine (not mushy-middle) solutions that address everyone&#x27;s core interests. That is the kind of movement we need today, not a revival of the movements of the Sixties&quot;.

== Assessment ==
Mark Satin has been a controversial public figure since the age of 20. Assessments of his significance vary widely.

Some observers see him as an exemplary figure. David Armstrong, for example, in his study of independent American journalism, presents Satin as an embodiment of the &quot;do-it-yourself spirit&quot; that makes an independent press possible. Futurists Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps portray Satin as a pioneer &quot;networker&quot; who spent two years riding the bus across the U.S. in an attempt to connect like-minded thinkers and activists. Marilyn Ferguson, author of &quot;The Aquarian Conspiracy&quot;, says that by engaging in a lifelong series of personal and political experiments with few resources, Satin is playing the role of the holy &quot;Fool&quot; for his time.

Other observers stress the freshness of Satin&#x27;s political vision. Social scientists Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, for example, argue that Satin anticipated the perspectives of 21st century social movements better than nearly anyone. Humanistic psychologist John Amodeo says Satin is one of the few political theorists to grasp the connection between personal growth and constructive political change. Ecofeminist Greta Gaard claims that Satin &quot;played a significant role in facilitating the articulation of Green political thought&quot;. Policy analyst Michael Edwards sees Satin as a pioneering trans-partisan thinker. Peace researcher Hanna Newcombe finds a spiritual dimension in Satin&#x27;s politics. Political scientist Christa Slaton&#x27;s short list of &quot;nonacademic&quot; transformationalists consists of Alvin and Heidi Toffler, Fritjof Capra, Marilyn Ferguson, Hazel Henderson, Betty Friedan, E. F. Schumacher, John Naisbitt, and Mark Satin.

Some see Satin as a classic example of the perpetual rebel and trace the cause back to his early years. For example, author Roger Neville Williams focuses on the harshness and &quot;paternalistic rectitude&quot; of Satin&#x27;s parents. Novelist Dan Wakefield, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, says Satin grew up in a small city in northern Minnesota like Bob Dylan but did not have a guitar to express himself with. According to historian Frank Kusch, the seeds for rebellion were planted when Satin&#x27;s parents moved him at age 16 from liberal Minnesota to still-segregated Texas.

Although many observers praise or are intrigued by Satin, many find him dismaying. Memoirist George Fetherling, for example, remembers him as a publicity hound. Literary critic Dennis Duffy calls him incapable of learning from his experiences. Green Party activist Howie Hawkins sees him as &quot;virulently anti-left&quot;. The &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; portrayed him in his 50s as a former New Age &quot;guru&quot;, and &quot;Commonweal&quot; compares reading him to listening to glass shards grate against a blackboard.

Other observers see Satin as an emotionally wounded figure. For example, historian Pierre Berton calls him a &quot;footloose wanderer&quot; and says he hitchhiked across Canada 16 times. Culture critic Annie Gottlieb, who attributes Satin&#x27;s wounds to his struggle against the Vietnam War, points out that even as a successful newsletter publisher in Washington, DC, he paid himself the salary of a monk.

The major substantive criticisms of Satin&#x27;s work have remained constant over time. His ideas are sometimes said to be superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, and overly simple in the 2000s. His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political in the sense of not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.

Satin has long been faulted for mixing views from different parts of his political odyssey. In the 1970s, for example, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; editor Robert Nielsen argued that Satin&#x27;s leftist pacifism warps his New Age vision. Three decades later, public-policy analyst Gadi Dechter argued that Satin&#x27;s New Age emotionalism and impracticality blunt his radical-centrist message. At 58, Satin suggested his message could not be understood without appreciating all the strands of his personal and political journey:

From my New Left years I took a love of political struggle. From my New Age years I took a conviction that politics needs to be about more than endless struggle – that responsible human beings need to search for reconciliation and healing and mutually acceptable solutions. From my time in the legal profession I took an understanding (and it is no small understanding) that sincerity and passion are not enough – that to be truly effective in the world one needs to be credible and expert. ...

Many Americans are living complicated lives now – few of us have moved through life in a straight line. I think many of us would benefit from trying to gather and synthesize the difficult political lessons we&#x27;ve learned over the course of our lives.

<doc id="475192" wikidata="Q2918627" url="?curid=475192" title="Mid-Levels">
<text>Mid-Levels (Chinese: 半山區) is an affluent residential area on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. It is located between Victoria Peak and Central. Residents are predominantly more affluent Hong Kong locals and expatriate professionals.

It has a population of 49,320 people, with 62.4% being Chinese. The largest ethnic minority groups include Filipinos (15%) and white (10.1%) .

The Mid-Levels is further divided into four areas (From the below, Mid-Levels of Central District can be subdivided into two Mid-Levels. Included: Mid-Levels West and Mid-Levels Central):
*Mid-Levels West (near Central, Sheung Wan and Sai Wan including Bonham Road, Caine Road, and Conduit Road etc.
*Mid-Levels Central (near Central, Admiralty and Wan Chai, above the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens and Hong Kong Park. Including MacDonnell Road, Kennedy Road, Old Peak Road and Bowen Road) etc.
* Mid-Levels East (near Causeway Bay, including Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, Stubbs Road and Mount Butler),
* Mid-Levels North (near North Point including Braemar Hill).

Aside from the panoramic views of Victoria Harbour and the rest of the city, it is also close to Central and Admiralty, which are both significant business areas, thus providing easy and convenient access for the business people living in Mid-Levels. An added attraction of the Mid-Levels is its close proximity to nature and comparatively better air quality than many parts of Hong Kong Island. Many wealthy people in Hong Kong are willing to pay higher residential property prices for a residence that is further away from pollution and yet remains close to the centre of the city.

Many streets are named after former governors of Hong Kong. Examples include Bonham Road (after George Bonham, 1848–1854) and Kennedy Road (after Arthur Edward Kennedy, 1872–1877). Many of the roads in this area are within walking distance of the Central Business District, which is accessible by the Mid-Levels escalator from Central.

Many choices for housing are available, from ultra-luxurious apartments to compact, near-luxury apartments. The costs of these apartments vary considerably according to the size, location, and age of the building. The cost ranges from the high ten million dollars to over five hundred million Hong Kong dollars for an apartment in a Frank Gehry-designed building.

Many prestigious colleges and schools are located in Mid-Levels, including the University of Hong Kong, St Francis&#x27; Canossian College, Island School, King&#x27;s College, Ying Wa Girls&#x27; School, St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College and St. Joseph&#x27;s College, to name a few.

==History==
The first houses in Mid-Levels were often large mansions, with gardens built out on terraces on the steep hillside, with names such as &quot;Rose Hill&quot; and &quot;Cringleford&quot;, and &quot;Idlewild&quot;. Sara Roosevelt, the mother of Franklin D. Roosevelt, lived with her family on Rose Hill from 1862 to 1865 during the American Civil War.

==Central–Mid-Levels escalator==
The Central–Mid-Levels escalator cuts through the Mid-Levels, from Central to Conduit Road. It allows people to travel quickly between these two places, compared with travelling by the winding roads up the mountain. At , it is the longest outdoor escalator in the world. It was opened on 15 October 1993. The escalator runs downhill from 6 am to 10 am and uphill from 10:30 am to midnight every day. Pedestrians travelling in the opposite direction make use of the adjacent stairs and footpaths. Apart from its transportation function, it is a tourist attraction. Sections of the escalator had been under renovation in 2018 and 2019, with some sections closed for maintenance.

==Streets==

===Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens===

The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens is one of the oldest Zoological and Botanical centres in the world. It is located on the northern slope of Victoria Peak and has been opened to the public since 1862. In 1871, it was officially renamed to Botanical Gardens, and in 1975, the name was changed again to Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens. This venerable park was previously named &quot;Bing Tao Garden&quot;, meaning the Chief Commander&#x27;s Garden. It was then linked to the garden of the Government House. In 1941, a bronze statue of King George VI was erected in the garden to mark the centenary year in which Hong Kong became a British Colony.

Keeping wild animals in the garden can be traced as early as 1876. At that time, animals were kept merely for entertainment. From the 1970s, the emphasis changed to techniques in captive breeding and conservation breeding programmes for zoological collection. Today, the garden has a collection of over 600 birds, 70 mammals, and 40 reptiles which are housed in about 40 enclosures. The collection includes orangutans, gibbons and other primates; the American flamingo, jaguar and Burmese python can be found here as well. There is an active breeding programme for many of these species, notably the orangutans, gibbons, and lemurs which rarely breed in captivity.

The garden keeps for more than 1000 species of inland plant such as conifer, fig, palm, gum trees, and magnolia. Besides, a greenhouse at the eastern boundary of the garden houses over 150 native and exotic species including orchids, ferns, bromeliads, climbers and house plants.

<doc id="475195" wikidata="Q778683" url="?curid=475195" title="Evidence (short story)">
<text>&quot;Evidence&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the September 1946 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990).

==Background==
&quot;Evidence&quot; was the only story Isaac Asimov wrote while in the United States Army from November 1945 to July 1946. He began the story at Camp Lee in January, finished it in April in Honolulu while waiting to go to Operation Crossroads, and sold it to editor John W. Campbell that month.

Orson Welles purchased film rights for &quot;Evidence&quot; for $250. Asimov thought that he would become famous from a movie based on the story, but Welles never used the script. His wife, Gertrude Blugerman, advised him to hold out for more money, but neither of them considered option payments which could be renewed every several years, allowing the movie rights to relapse if Welles took no action.

==Plot summary==
Stephen Byerley is severely injured in a car accident. After a slow recovery he becomes a successful district attorney, and runs for mayor of a major American city. His opponent Francis Quinn&#x27;s political machine claims that the real Stephen Byerley was permanently disfigured and crippled by the accident. The Byerley who appears in public is a humanoid robot, Quinn says, created by the real Byerley who is now the robot&#x27;s mysterious unseen &quot;teacher&quot;, now away doing unspecified scientific work.

Most voters do not believe Quinn but if he is correct Byerley&#x27;s campaign will end, as only humans can legally run for office. Quinn approaches U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men corporation, the world&#x27;s only supplier of positronic robot brains, for proof that Byerley must be a robot. No one has ever seen Byerley eat or sleep, Quinn reports.

All attempts to prove or disprove Byerley&#x27;s humanity fail, but Quinn&#x27;s smear campaign slowly persuades voters until it becomes the only issue in the campaign. Alfred Lanning and Dr. Susan Calvin, the Chief Robopsychologist of U.S. Robots, visit Byerley. She offers him an apple; Byerley takes a bite, but he may have been designed with a stomach. Quinn attempts to take clandestine X-ray photographs, but Byerley wears a device which fogs the camera; he says that he is upholding his civil rights, as he would do for others if he is elected. His opponents claim that as a robot he has no civil rights, but Byerley replies that they must first prove that he is a robot before they can deny his rights as a human, including his right not to submit to physical examination.

Calvin observes that if Byerley is a robot, he must obey the Three Laws of Robotics. Were he to violate one of the Laws he would clearly be a human, since no robot can contradict its basic programming. The district attorney never seeks the death penalty and boasts that he has never prosecuted an innocent man, but if he obeys the Laws it still does not prove that Byerley is a robot, since the Laws are based on human morality; &quot;He may simply be a very good man&quot;, Calvin says. To prove himself to be a human being, Byerley must demonstrate that he can harm a human, which would violate the First Law.

The local election is discussed around the world and Byerley becomes famous. During a globally broadcast speech to a hostile audience, a heckler climbs onto the stage and challenges Byerley to hit him in the face. Millions watch the candidate punch the heckler in the face. Calvin tells the press that Byerley is human. With the expert&#x27;s verdict disproving Quinn&#x27;s claim, Byerley wins the election.

Calvin again visits Byerley. The mayor-elect confesses that his campaign spread the rumor that Byerley had never and could not hit a man, to provoke someone to challenge him. The robopsychologist says that she regrets that he is human, because a robot would make an ideal ruler, one incapable of cruelty or injustice. Calvin notes that a robot may avoid breaking the First Law if the &quot;man&quot; who is harmed is not a man, but another humanoid robot, implying that the heckler whom Byerley punched may have been a robot. Calvin believes that Byerley&#x27;s &quot;teacher&quot; is the real Stephen Byerley who after being severely disabled in his car accident, developed a human-like robot to achieve great things. In the binding text of &quot;I, Robot&quot; Calvin notes that Byerley had his body atomized upon death, destroying any evidence, but she personally believed that he was a robot.

Calvin promises to vote for Byerley when he runs for higher office. By Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot;, Byerley is head of the planetary government.

<doc id="475199" wikidata="Q209190" url="?curid=475199" title="Low-pressure area">
<text>In meteorology, a low-pressure area, low areaor low is a region where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations. It is the opposite of a high-pressure area. Low-pressure areas are commonly associated with inclement weather (such as cloudy, windy, with possible rain or storms), while high-pressure areas are associated with lighter winds and clear skies. Winds circle anti-clockwise around lows in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, due to opposing Coriolis forces. Low-pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the atmosphere (aloft). The formation process of a low-pressure area is known as cyclogenesis. In meteorology, atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two kinds of places:
* The first is in the area on the east side of upper troughs, which form half of a Rossby wave within the Westerlies (a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere).
* A second is an area where wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs, which are of smaller wavelength.

Diverging winds aloft, ahead of these troughs, cause atmospheric lift within the troposphere below as air flows upwards away from the surface, which lowers surface pressures as this upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity packing the air close to the ground.

Thermal lows form due to localized heating caused by greater solar incidence over deserts and other land masses. Since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings, this warmer air rises, which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Large-scale thermal lows over continents help drive monsoon circulations. Low-pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water. When this occurs over the tropics in concert with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, it is known as a monsoon trough. Monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in August and their southerly extent in February. When a convective low acquires a well-hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during December.

Atmospheric lift will also generally produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air temperature drops below the dew point as it rises, the cloudy skies typical of low-pressure areas act to dampen diurnal temperature extremes. Since clouds reflect sunlight, incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases, which causes lower temperatures during the day. At night the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation, such as heat energy from the surface, allows for warmer night-time minimums in all seasons. The stronger the area of low pressure, the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity. Globally, low-pressure systems are most frequently located over the Tibetan Plateau and in the lee of the Rocky Mountains. In Europe (particularly in the British Isles and Netherlands), recurring low-pressure weather systems are typically known as &quot;low levels&quot;.

==Formation==

Cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of cyclonic circulations, or low-pressure areas, within the atmosphere. Cyclogenesis is the opposite of , and has an anticyclonic (high-pressure system) equivalent which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—anticyclogenesis. Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes, all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone. Meteorologists use the term &quot;cyclone&quot; where circular pressure systems flow in the direction of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, which normally coincides with areas of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones, mesocyclones, and polar lows lie within the smaller mesoscale. Subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size. &quot;Cyclogenesis&quot; can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale. Larger-scale troughs, also called Rossby waves, are synoptic in scale. Shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale, or mesoscale in nature. Both Rossby waves and shortwaves embedded within the flow around Rossby waves migrate equatorward of the polar cyclones located in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. All share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lowers surface pressure.

Extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts due to a passing by shortwave aloft or upper-level jet streak before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core cyclones. Polar lows are small-scale, short-lived atmospheric low-pressure systems that occur over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather-systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and offshore platforms. They are vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least .
Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm-core with well-defined circulations. Certain criteria need to be met for their formation. In most situations, water temperatures of at least are needed down to a depth of at least ; waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms. Another factor is rapid cooling with height, which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone. High humidity is needed, especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere, conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop. Low amounts of wind shear are needed, as high shear is disruptive to the storm&#x27;s circulation. Lastly, a formative tropical cyclone needs a pre-existing system of disturbed weather, although without a circulation no cyclonic development will take place. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear.

In deserts, lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low-pressure area called a thermal low. Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean. This generates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean-air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation. In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. Monsoons resemble sea and land breezes, terms usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale - also stronger and seasonal.

==Climatology==

===Mid-latitudes and subtropics===
Large polar cyclones help determine the steering of systems moving through the mid-latitudes, south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic. The Arctic oscillation provides an index used to gauge the magnitude of this effect in the Northern Hemisphere. Extratropical cyclones tend to form east of climatological trough positions aloft near the east coast of continents, or west side of oceans. A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter. In Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands, recurring extratropical low-pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions.
These tend to bring wet weather throughout the year. &quot;Thermal lows&quot; also occur during the summer over continental areas across the subtropics - such as the Sonoran Desert, the Mexican Plateau, the Sahara, South America, and Southeast Asia. The lows are most commonly located over the Tibetan Plateau and in the lee of the Rocky Mountains.

===Monsoon trough===
Elongated areas of low pressure form at the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone as part of the Hadley cell circulation. Monsoon troughing in the western Pacific reaches its zenith in latitude during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest. It can reach as far as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August and 20th parallel in Australia during February. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents. The large-scale thermal lows over continents help create pressure gradients which drive monsoon circulations. In the southern hemisphere, the monsoon trough associated with the Australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in February, oriented along a west-northwest/east-southeast axis. Many of the world&#x27;s rainforests are associated with these climatological low-pressure systems.
===Tropical cyclone===
Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than or poleward of the 5th parallel north and 5th parallel south, allowing the Coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low-pressure center and creating a circulation. Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month while September is the most active month. Nearly one-third of the world&#x27;s tropical cyclones form within the western Pacific Ocean, making it the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth.

==Associated weather==

Wind is initially accelerated from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. This is due to density (or temperature and moisture) differences between two air masses. Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is denser and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low-pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. Thus, stronger areas of low pressure are associated with stronger winds.

The Coriolis force caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation is what gives winds around low-pressure areas (such as in hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons) their counter-clockwise (anticlockwise) circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). A tropical cyclone differs from a hurricane or typhoon based only on geographic location. A tropical cyclone is fundamentally different from a mid-latitude cyclone. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a tropical cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean. Friction with land slows down the wind flowing into low-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more inward, or flowing more ageostrophically, toward their centers. Tornadoes are often too small, and of too short duration, to be influenced by the Coriolis force, but may be so-influenced when arising from a low-pressure system.

<doc id="475201" wikidata="Q775223" url="?curid=475201" title="The Evitable Conflict">
<text>&quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It first appeared in the June 1950 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and subsequently appeared in the collections &quot;I, Robot&quot; (1950), &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982), and &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (1990). It features the character Stephen Byerley from the earlier &quot;Evidence&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Following on from the previous story &#x27;Evidence,&#x27; in the year 2052, Stephen Byerley has been elected World Co-ordinator for a second term. Earth is divided into four geographical regions, each with a powerful supercomputer known as a Machine managing its economy. Byerley becomes concerned upon learning that the Machines have recently made errors leading to economic inefficiency. Consulting with the four regional Vice Co-ordinators, he finds that several prominent individuals and companies associated with the anti-Machine &quot;Society for Humanity&quot; have been damaged by the Machines&#x27; apparent mistakes.

Byerley believes that the Society is attempting to undermine the Machines by disobeying their instructions, with the goal of retaking power as humans, and proposes to have the movement suppressed. Susan Calvin tells him that this will not work, contending that the errors are in fact deliberate acts by the Machines. The Machines recognize their own necessity to humanity&#x27;s continued peace and prosperity, and have thus inflicted a small amount of harm on selected individuals in order to protect themselves and continue guiding humanity&#x27;s future. They keep their intent a secret to avoid anger and resistance by humans. Calvin concludes that the Machines have generalized the First Law to mean &quot;No machine may harm humanity; or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.&quot; (This is similar to the Zeroth Law which Asimov developed in later novels.) In effect, the Machines have decided that the only way to follow the First Law is to take control of humanity.

At the story&#x27;s conclusion, Byerley and Calvin discuss whether the Machines&#x27; actions are ultimately for the best. While Byerley is initially horrified by the prospect of humanity losing any say in its future, Calvin suggests that humanity has never truly been in full command of its future, as humans&#x27; choices have always been dictated by their need to survive—leaving their destiny at the mercy of environmental and economic factors affecting their access to the Earth&#x27;s limited resources. But since the Machines can manage the Earth&#x27;s resources more efficiently than humans ever could, humans finally have all that they could ever need to survive, and interhuman conflicts are no longer necessary—finally putting world peace within humanity&#x27;s grasp.

==Reception==
Stanisław Lem praised the story&#x27;s central theme as futurologically and empirically valuable.

The story was broadcast as the final episode of a five-part &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; &quot;radio adaptation&quot; of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in February 2017.

The 2004 film adaptation of &quot;I, Robot&quot; also includes major elements of the Evitable Conflict with the computer system V.I.K.I. taking the part of the Machine.

<doc id="475202" wikidata="Q7319945" url="?curid=475202" title="Rg chromaticity">
<text>The RGB chromaticity space, two dimensions of the &quot;normalized RGB s&quot;pace,
is a chromaticity space, a two-dimensional color space in which there is no intensity information.

In the RGB color space a pixel is identified by the intensity of red, green, and blue primary colors. Therefore, a bright red can be represented as (R,G,B) (255,0,0), while a dark red may be (40,0,0). In the normalized RGB space or RG space, a color is represented by the proportion of red, green, and blue in the color, rather than by the intensity of each. Since these proportions must always add up to a total of 1, we are able to quote just the red and green proportions of the color, and can calculate the blue value if necessary.

==Conversion between RGB and RG Chromaticity==
Given a color (R,G,B) where R, G, B = &quot;linear&quot; intensity of red, green and blue, this can be converted to color formula_1 where formula_2 imply the proportion of red, green and blue in the original color:

formula_3

formula_4

formula_5

formula_6
The sum of rgb will always equal one, because of this property the b dimension can be thrown away without causing any loss in information. The reverse conversion is not possible with only two dimensions, as the intensity information is lost during the conversion to rg chromaticity, e.g. (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) has equal proportions of each color, but it is not possible to determine whether this corresponds to black, gray, or white. If R, G, B, is normalized to r, g, G color space the conversion can be computed by the following:
formula_7

formula_8

formula_9 
The conversion from rgG to RGB, is the same as the conversion from xyY to XYZ. The conversion requires at least some information relative to the intensity of the scene. For this reason if the G is preserved then the inverse is possible.

== Version used in computer vision ==

=== Motivation ===
Computer vision algorithms tend to suffer from varying imaging conditions. To make more robust computer vision algorithms it is important to use a (approximately) color invariant color space. Color invariant color spaces are desensitized to disturbances in the image. One common problem in computer vision is varying light source (color and intensity) between multiple images and within a single image.

The rg colorspace is used out of a desire for . For example, if a scene is lit by a spotlight, an object of a given color will change in apparent color as it moves across the scene. Where color is being used to track an object in an RGB image, this can cause problems. Removing the intensity component should keep the color constant.

=== Practice ===
In practice, computer vision uses an &quot;incorrect&quot; form of rg colorspace derived directly from gamma-corrected RGB, typically sRGB. As a result, full removal of intensity is not achieved and 3D objects still show some of fringing.

===Illustration===


===rg color space===

r, g, and b chromaticity coordinates are ratios of the one tristimulus value over the sum of all three tristimulus values. A neutral object infers equal values of red, green and blue stimulus. The lack of luminance information in rg prevents having more than 1 neutral point where all three coordinates are of equal value. The white point of the rg chromaticity diagram is defined by the point (1/3,1/3). The white point has one third red, one third green and the final third blue. On an rg chromaticity diagram the first quadrant where all values of r and g are positive forms a right triangle. With max r equals 1 unit along the x and max g equals 1 unit along the y axis. Connecting a line from the max r (1,0) to max g (0,1) from a straight line with slope of negative 1. Any sample that falls on this line has no blue. Moving along the line from max r to max g, shows a decrease in red and an increase of green in the sample, without blue changing. The further a sample moves from this line the more blue is present in the sample trying to be matched.

==CIE RGB==

RGB is a color mixture system. Once the color matching function are determined the tristimulus values can be determined easily. Since standardization is required to compare results, CIE established standards to determine color matching function.

Therefore, a white with equi-energy lights of 1.000 + 4.5907 + 0.0601 = 5.6508 lm can be matched by mixing together R, G and B. Guild and Wright used 17 subjects to determine RGB color matching functions. RGB color matching serve as the base for rg chromaticity. The RGB color matching functions are used to determine the tristimulus RGB values for a spectrum. Normalizing the RGB tristimulus values converts the tristimulus into rgb. Normalized RGB tristimulus value can be plotted on an rg chromaticity diagram.

An example of color matching function below. formula_10 is any monochromatic. Any monochromatic can be matched by adding reference stimuli formula_11 and formula_12. The test light is also to bright to account for this reference stimuli is added to the target to dull the saturation. Thus formula_13 is negative. formula_14 and formula_15 can be defined as a vector in a three-dimensional space. This three-dimensional space is defined as the color space. Any color formula_16 can be reached by matching a given amount of formula_14 and formula_15.
formula_19

formula_20
The negativeformula_21 calls for color matching functions that are negative at certain wavelengths. This is evidence of why the formula_22 color matching function appears to have negative tristimulus values.

===rg chromaticity diagram===

The figure to the side is a plotted rg chromaticity diagram. Noting the importance of the E which is defined as the white point where rg are equal and have a value of 1/3. Next notice the straight line from (0,1) to (1,0), follows the expression y = -x + 1. As the x (red) increases the y (green) decreases by the same amount. Any point on the line represents the limit in rg, and can be defined by a point that has no b information and formed by some combination of r and g. Moving of the linear line towards E represents a decrease in r and g and an increase in b. In computer vision and digital imagery only use the first quadrant because a computer cannot display negative RGB values. The range of RGB is 0-255 for most displays. But when trying to form color matches using real stimuli negative values are needed according to Grassmann&#x27;s Laws to match all possible colors. This is why the rg chromaticity diagram extends in the negative r direction.

===Conversion xyY color system===

Avoiding negative color coordinate values prompted the change from to rg to xy. Negative coordinates are used in rg space because when making a spectral sample match can be created by adding stimulus to the sample. The color matching functions r, g, and b are negative at certain wavelengths to allow for any monochromatic sample to be matched. This is why in the rg chromaticity diagram the spectral locus extents into the negative r direction and ever so slightly into the negative g direction. On an xy chromaticity diagram the spectral locus if formed by all positive values of x and y.

<doc id="475204" wikidata="Q3408488" url="?curid=475204" title="New World First Bus">
<text>New World First Bus Services Limited (NWFB) was the third-largest bus operator in Hong Kong. Established by NWS Holdings and FirstGroup in September 1998, it took over 88 China Motor Bus services in Hong Kong Island. From 2020 until its merger with Citybus in 2023, it was a subsidiary of Bravo Transport, the owner of Citybus. The NWFB brand was retired on 1 July 2023 with operations merged into Citybus.

==History==

=== Background ===
Before NWFB was established, franchised bus service in Hong Kong Island was provided by China Motor Bus (CMB) (franchisee since 1933) and Citybus (franchisee since 1991). In the early 1990s, the service levels of CMB were in decline. Therefore, the Government of Hong Kong started to introduce new competitors by transferring the franchise of CMB routes to other companies. As a result, Citybus became the second franchisee of the bus service on Hong Kong Island. Over 40 routes were transferred between 1991 and 1995. In spite of the loss of many profitable routes, the service of CMB did not show any significant improvement. 

=== Bidding for franchise ===
In February 1998, the government announced the franchise for all 140 routes operated by CMB would not be reviewed when it expired 31 August that year. Eighty-eight of the routes were placed to open tender, 12 routes were transferred directly to Citybus, one cross-harbour route to Kowloon Motor Bus, and the remaining routes were cancelled.

Six companies lodged bids:

NWS Holdings was considered a dark horse as it was the only bidder with no local bus operation experience. However, NWS Holdings was awarded a replacement franchise in March 1998 with commitments of new facilities, improved service standards and employment of CMB staff. During the handover in mid-1998, NWFB faced a lot of difficulties since CMB was reluctant to cooperate. NWFB commenced operating at midnight on 1 September 1998 after a series of negotiations and with help from the government. However NWFB had already started its operation of other non-overnight routes at midnight as CMB refused to operate after that time.

=== Start of operations ===
NWFB took over 88 bus routes on 1 September 1998, with the fleet mostly were 710 step-entrance buses. In order to compete with Citybus and KMB, NWFB has purchased 500 new low-floor buses, out of which 76 are Dennis Dart SLF and the remaining are all low-floor, and 50 buses commenced operations immediately. Step-entrance buses had the NWFB logo applied over the CMB logos and blue patches over the CMB corporate flag, before repainting it to NWFB livery, and upgraded the floor, handrails, lighting system and seating layout. The seating layout was changed from 3+2 to 2+2, making a typical refurbished bus accommodate 10 fewer passengers than one before refurbishment.

As for the older buses from CMB, they were all gradually phased out by January 2016, becoming full low-floor fleet except for two Dennis Condors (DM18 and DM22) and two Volvo Olympians (VA51 and VA54) which were transferred to Citybus before retirement. After the phasing out of all older buses from CMB, NWFB also began retirement of the first-generation low-floor fleet, and 1220 was even transferred to Citybus before retirement in 13 December 2020.

In May 2000 FirstGroup sold its shares to joint venture partner New World Development giving it 100% ownership.

In June 2003 fellow franchised bus operator Citybus was purchased by NWFB parent company NWS Holdings, bringing the bus services of Hong Kong Island once again under control of a single organisation. Before the acquisition, many of the two companies&#x27; competing routes overlap each other. In order to make better use of company resources, many routes were reshuffled. Redundant routes were cancelled, and Octopus card bus-bus interchange discounts were introduced between routes of both companies.

In January 2004 NWFB took a 51% shareholding in Kunming New World First Bus, a joint venture established with the Kunming government to operate services to Kunming in Yunnan on 39 routes with 700 buses.

=== Retirement of brand ===
In August 2020, along with Citybus, NWFB was sold to the Bravo Transport consortium, made up of private equity firm Templewater Bravo, Hong Kong-listed investment holding company Hans Energy and Ascendal Group.

In July 2022, Bravo Transport announced that it would be retiring the NWFB brand, with operations merged into Citybus when the next franchise commenced on 1 July 2023. In July 2023, the brand was retired.

==Fleet==
As at July 2022, the fleet consisted of 650 buses. NWFB operated four depots at Heng Fa Chuen, Wong Chuk Hang, Tseung Kwan O and West Kowloon.

==Routes==
Before the merger with Citybus, New World First Bus had 168 routes. Triple digit routes beginning with 5 were originally air-conditioned only bus routes in the 1990s, now all these were rationalised and only three bus services remains (511, 592 and 595). In October 2009, NWFB commenced operating through its Rickshaw Sightseeing Bus subsidiary.

<doc id="475208" wikidata="Q650314" url="?curid=475208" title="The Feast of the Goat">
<text>The Feast of the Goat () is a 2000 novel by the Peruvian Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. The book is set in the Dominican Republic and portrays the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and its aftermath, from two distinct standpoints a generation apart: during and immediately after the assassination itself, in May 1961; and thirty-five years later, in 1996. Throughout, there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship, in the 1950s, and its significance for the island and its inhabitants.

The novel follows three interwoven storylines. The first concerns a woman, Urania Cabral, who is back in the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father. Eventually, she ends up recalling incidents from her youth before recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo&#x27;s life from the moment he wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime&#x27;s inner circle, to which Urania&#x27;s father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo&#x27;s assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins&#x27; persecution. Each aspect of the book&#x27;s plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic&#x27;s political and social environment, past and present.

Readers are shown the regime&#x27;s downward spiral, Trujillo&#x27;s assassination, and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders, conspirators, and a middle-aged woman looking back. The novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power, including its psychological effects and its long-term impact. The novel&#x27;s themes include the nature of power and corruption, and their relationship to machismo or sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles. Memory, and the process of remembering, is also an important theme, especially in Urania&#x27;s narrative as she recalls her youth in the Dominican Republic. Her story (and the book as a whole) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14. 

Vargas Llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events: the book is not a documentary and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional. On the other hand, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo&#x27;s assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people&#x27;s stories, to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked. In Vargas Llosa&#x27;s words, &quot;It&#x27;s a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. [. . .] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive—and I have not exaggerated.&quot; 
&quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book&#x27;s depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, as well as the graphic descriptions of violent events. It has been described as a powerful exploration of the atrocities associated with dictatorship, and a testament to the dangers of absolute power.

A film version of the novel was released in 2005, starring Isabella Rossellini, Paul Freeman, and Tomas Milian. Jorge Alí Triana and his daughter, Veronica Triana, wrote a theatrical adaptation in 2003.

== Background ==
&quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; is only the second of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s novels to be set outside Peru (the first being &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot;). It is also unusual because it&#x27;s the first to have a female protagonist: as critic Lynn Walford writes of the leading character in &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot;, and also Vargas Llosa&#x27;s subsequent book &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot;, &quot;both are utterly unlike any of the other female characters in his previous novels&quot;.
The novel examines the dictatorial regime of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina in the Dominican Republic. Trujillo was, in historian Eric Roorda&#x27;s words, &quot;a towering influence in Dominican and Caribbean history&quot; who presided over &quot;one of the most durable regimes of the twentieth century&quot; during the thirty-one years between his seizure of power in 1930 and his assassination in 1961. Trujillo had trained with the United States Marine Corps during the United States occupation of the island, and graduated from the Haina Military Academy in 1921. After the U.S. departed in 1924, he became head of the Dominican National Police which, under his command, was transformed into the Dominican National Army and Trujillo&#x27;s personal &quot;virtually autonomous power base&quot;.

Trujillo was officially dictator only from 1930 to 1938, and from 1942 to 1952, but remained in effective power throughout the entire period. Though his regime was broadly nationalist, Daniel Chirot comments that he had &quot;no particular ideology&quot; and his economic and social policies were basically progressive.

The novel&#x27;s title is taken from the popular Dominican merengue &quot;Mataron al Chivo&quot; (&quot;They Killed the Goat&quot;), which refers to Trujillo&#x27;s assassination on May 30, 1961. Merengue is a style of music created by Ñico Lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by Trujillo himself. It&#x27;s now considered the country&#x27;s national music. Cultural critics Julie Sellers and Stephen Ropp comment about this particular merengue that, by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could be turned into a stew (as frequently happened with goats struck down on the Dominican Republic&#x27;s highways), the song &quot;gave those performing, listening to, and dancing to this merengue a sense of control over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades.&quot; Vargas Llosa quotes the lyrics to &quot;Mataron al Chivo&quot; at the beginning of his novel.

==Plot summary==
The novel&#x27;s narrative is divided into three distinct strands. One is centred on Urania Cabral, a fictional Dominican character; another deals with the conspirators involved in Trujillo&#x27;s assassination; and the third focuses on Trujillo himself. The novel alternates between these storylines, while jumping back and forth from 1961 to 1996, with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo&#x27;s regime.

&quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; begins with the return of Urania to her hometown of Santo Domingo, a city which had been renamed Ciudad Trujillo during Trujillo&#x27;s time in power. This storyline is largely introspective, dealing with Urania&#x27;s memories and her inner turmoil over the events preceding her departure from the Dominican Republic thirty-five years earlier. Urania escaped the crumbling Trujillo regime in 1961 by claiming she planned to study under a tutelage of nuns in Michigan. In the following decades, she becomes a prominent and successful New York lawyer. She finally returns to the Dominican Republic in 1996, on a whim, before finding herself compelled to confront her father and elements of her past she has long ignored. As Urania speaks to her ailing father, Agustin Cabral, she recalls more and more of the anger and disgust that led to her thirty-five years of silence. Urania retells her father&#x27;s descent into political disgrace, while revealing the betrayal that forms a crux between both Urania&#x27;s storyline and that of Trujillo himself.

The second and third storylines are set in 1961, in the weeks prior to and following Trujillo&#x27;s assassination on May 30. Each assassin has his own background story, explaining his motivation for their involvement in the assassination plot. Each has been wronged by Trujillo and his regime, by torture and brutality, or through assaults on their pride, religious faith, morality, and loved ones. Vargas Llosa weaves the tale of the men as memories recalled on the night of Trujillo&#x27;s death, as the conspirators lie in wait for &quot;The Goat&quot;. Interconnected with these stories are the actions of other famous Trujillistas of the time: Joaquín Balaguer, the puppet president; Johnny Abbes García, the merciless head of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM); and various others—some real, some composites of historical figures, and some purely fictional.

The third storyline is concerned with the thoughts and motives of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina himself. The chapters concerning &quot;The Goat&quot; recall the major events of his time, including the slaughter of thousands of Dominican Haitians in 1937. They also deal with the Dominican Republic&#x27;s tense international relationships during the Cold War, especially with the United States under the presidency of John F. Kennedy and Cuba under Castro. Vargas Llosa also speculates upon Trujillo&#x27;s innermost thoughts and paints a picture of a man whose physical body is slowly failing him. Trujillo is tormented by both his incontinence and impotence. Eventually, his storyline intersects with Urania&#x27;s narrative when it&#x27;s revealed that Urania was sexually assaulted by Trujillo. He is unable to achieve an erection with Urania and, in frustration, rapes her with his bare hands. This event is the core of Urania&#x27;s shame and hatred towards her own father. In addition, it&#x27;s the cause of Trujillo&#x27;s repeated anger over the &quot;anemic little bitch&quot; who witnessed his impotence and emotion, as well as the reason he&#x27;s en route to sleep with another girl on the night of his assassination.

In the novel&#x27;s final chapters, the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of government agents, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo&#x27;s most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.

==Characters==

===Modern day===
Urania Cabral and her father Agustín Cabral appear in both the modern day and historical portions of the novel. In the year 1996, Urania returns to the Dominican Republic for the first time since her departure at the age of 14. She is a successful New York lawyer who has spent most of the past 35 years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood, a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with Trujillo and Dominican history. Urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past, and is compelled to confront her father Agustín about his role in those events. Urania visits her father, finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke, so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence, let alone speak. Agustín listens helplessly as Urania recounts his past as &quot;Egghead Cabral&quot;, a high-ranking member of Trujillo&#x27;s inner circle, and his drastic fall from grace. Urania details Agustín&#x27;s role in the events that led to her rape by the Dominican leader, and subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma. Agustín&#x27;s character in the modern day portion of the novel serves primarily as a sounding board for Urania&#x27;s recollections of the Trujillo era, and the events that surrounded both Agustín Cabral&#x27;s disgrace and Urania&#x27;s escape from the country. His responses are usually minimal or non-vocal, despite the ardency of Urania&#x27;s accusations and the enormity of his own actions during Trujillo&#x27;s reign.

===The Trujillo regime===

Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized character based on the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot;, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells the Goat&#x27;s last hours from his own perspective.
Trujillo&#x27;s character struggles with aging and the physical problems of incontinence and impotence. Through fictional events and first person narrative, the reader is given insight into the man who, during his &quot;thirty-one years of horrendous political crimes&quot;, modernized the country&#x27;s infrastructure and military, but whose regime&#x27;s attack against its enemies overseas (particularly the attempted assassination of Rómulo Betancourt, president of Venezuela) led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States in the 1950s. The resultant economic downturn, in conjunction with other factors, leads to the CIA supported assassination plot that ended Trujillo&#x27;s life on May 30, 1961.

Trujillo&#x27;s regime is supported by Johnny Abbes García, the head of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM), a brutal man to whom many &quot;disappearances, ... executions, ... sudden falls into disgrace&quot; are attributed. Abbes and his intelligence officers are notorious for their cruelty, particularly their habit of killing dissidents by throwing them into shark-infested waters. Colonel Abbes &quot;may be the devil, but he&#x27;s useful to the Chief; everything bad is attributed to him and only the good to Trujillo&quot;. Trujillo&#x27;s son, Ramfis Trujillo, is a loyal supporter of the Chief. After unsuccessful attempts at schooling in the United States, Ramfis returns to the Dominican Republic to serve in his father&#x27;s military. He&#x27;s a well-known womanizer. Upon Trujillo&#x27;s death, Ramfis seeks revenge, even going so far as to torture and kill his uncle by marriage, General Jose Roman, for his part in the assassination conspiracy.

Joaquín Balaguer, Trujillo&#x27;s puppet president is also a supporter, and initially his seemingly innocuous character holds no real power. Following Trujillo&#x27;s death, the calm and serenity of Balaguer bring about real change in his character, and General Román comments that &quot;this insignificant man whom everyone had always considered a mere clerk, a purely decorative figure in the regime, began to acquire surprising authority&quot;. It&#x27;s Balaguer who guides much of the action in the last sections of the book.

===Conspirators===

The storyline concerning the assassination primarily follows the four conspirators who directly participate in Trujillo&#x27;s death. Antonio Imbert Barrera is one of the few conspirators who survives the violent reprisals that follow Trujillo&#x27;s assassination. Imbert is a politician who becomes disillusioned with the deception and cruelty of Trujillo&#x27;s regime. His first plan to kill Trujillo was foiled by the unsuccessful attempted overthrow of the regime by Cuban paramilitary forces. Now convinced of the difficulty of his task, Imbert joins the other conspirators in plotting Trujillo&#x27;s death. Among the others is Antonio de la Maza, one of Trujillo&#x27;s personal guards. Antonio&#x27;s brother is killed as part of a government cover-up and Antonio swears revenge upon Trujillo. Salvador Estrella Sadhalá, known as &quot;Turk&quot;, is a devout Catholic who, in indignation at the regime&#x27;s many crimes against God, swears an oath against Trujillo. Turk eventually turns himself in for fear that the regime was torturing his family. Both Turk and his innocent brother are then tortured for months. His father remains loyal to Trujillo and disowns Turk in his face. Despite all of this, Turk refuses to commit suicide and doesn&#x27;t lose faith in God. He is later executed by Ramfis and other high level government men. Turk&#x27;s close friend, Amado García Guerrero, known as Amadito, is a Lieutenant in the army who gave up his beloved as proof of his loyalty to Trujillo, and then later was forced to kill her brother to prove himself to Trujillo. Amadito&#x27;s disgust with himself and disillusionment with the regime lead to his decision to help kill Trujillo. Following the assassination, he hides out with de la Maza and dies fighting. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amadito and Antonio de la Maza choose to fight the members of SIM who come to arrest them, opting to die in battle rather than be captured and tortured.

==Major themes==
&quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot;&#x27;s major themes include political corruption, machismo, memory, and writing and power. Olga Lorenzo, reviewer for &quot;The Melbourne Age&quot;, suggests that overall Vargas Llosa&#x27;s aim is to reveal the irrational forces of Latin tradition that give rise to despotism.

===Political corruption===
The structure of Dominican society was hierarchical, with strongly gendered roles. Rafael Trujillo, the ruler, was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of Santo Domingo even 35 years after his death. He is a true &quot;caudillo&quot;, ruling with brutality and corruption. He creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages decadence within his regime. Prior to their promotion for a position of responsibility, an officer is required to pass a &quot;test of loyalty&quot;. His people must remain loyal to him all cost. Their obedience is periodically tested by public humiliation and censure, even though acts of disloyalty were rare. Trujillo violates both women and children as an expression of his political/sexual power. In some cases, he sexually assaults the wife or child of his own lieutenants, many of whom still remain blindly loyal. Even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the tyrant for pleasure.

Many of the assassins had belonged to Trujillo&#x27;s regime or had at one point been his staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state&#x27;s crimes against its own citizens. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the Mirabal sisters: &quot;They kill our fathers, our brothers, our friends. And now they&#x27;re killing our women. And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn.&quot; In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo&#x27;s regime: &quot;He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the rest—and in corruption, too.&quot;

===Machismo===
According to literary scholar Peter Anthony Neissa, the two important components of machismo are aggressive behaviour and hyper-sexuality. Aggressive behaviour is exhibited by displays of power and strength, while hyper-sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible. These two components shape the portrayal of Trujillo and his regime in &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot;. As Lorenzo observes, Vargas Llosa &quot;reveals traditions of machismo, of abusive fathers, and of child-rearing practices that repeat the shaming of children, so that each generation bequeaths a withering of the soul to the subsequent one.&quot;

In a display of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded that his aides and cabinet provide him with sexual access to their wives or daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo&#x27;s machismo and treatment of women, &quot;[h]e went to bed with his ministers&#x27; wives, not only because he liked these ladies but because it was a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque role—and they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death.&quot; Trujillo&#x27;s sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Neissa&#x27;s words, &quot;The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance.&quot;

Trujillo&#x27;s attempted sexual conquest of Urania is an example of both political manipulation of Agustín Cabral and sexual power over young women. However, as Trujillo&#x27;s penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl, the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo.

===Memory===
All of the novel&#x27;s storylines concern memory in some sense or another. The most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of Urania Cabral, who has returned to the Dominican Republic for the first time in 30 years. Soon, Urania is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14. She was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Trujillo himself, a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again (a fact to which she alludes throughout the book, but which is only revealed at the very end). The book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins, who never knew the true reason she left the country. When her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details, Urania responds that while she forgets many things, &quot;I remember everything about that night.&quot; For Urania, forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable. Her father, on the other hand, is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering, since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking. However, Urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them.

Memory is also important in the sections of the novel that deal with the assassins. Each recalls the events that led him to take part in the assassination of Trujillo. These incidents included the 1956 Galindez kidnapping and murder, the 1960 murder of the Mirabal sisters, and the 1961 split with the Catholic Church. These historical events are used by Vargas Llosa to connect the assassins with specific moments that demonstrate the violence of Trujillo&#x27;s regime. Trujillo, too, is shown reflecting on the past, not least his own formation and training at the hands of the US Marines.

But above all, Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to facilitate the novel&#x27;s attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania&#x27;s story, effectively framing the narrative in the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study of the history of the Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.

===Writing and power===
In her treatment of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that &quot;power gives its wielder the ability to make prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told.&quot; The government&#x27;s actions in &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo&#x27;s country as they were seen as a threat to the government&#x27;s ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.

Ruiz notes that writing also has the power to transform reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one&#x27;s understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.

The construction of fictions surrounding the events of Trujillo&#x27;s regime allow a degree of freedom from the horrors that took places. Author Julia Alvarez contends that these events can &quot;only finally be understood by fiction, only finally be redeemed by the imagination&quot;, while Richard Patterson claims that Vargas Llosa &quot;reconfigures, and to a large degree demythologizes&quot; Trujillo and his brutal reign through use of narrative structure. Vargas Llosa&#x27;s writing acts as a cathartic force for this period in history.

==Fact and fiction==

The novel is a combination of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito&#x27;s murder of the brother of the woman he loved.

Those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people. President Balaguer is real, but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional. According to Wolff, Vargas Llosa &quot;uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo&#x27;s &quot;spiritual colonization&quot; of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family. The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime: through Agustin, the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation; through Urania, the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind. Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non-fictional, especially those of the Goat himself. According to literary scholar Richard Patterson, &quot;Vargas Llosa&#x27;s expands all the way into the very &quot;dark area&quot; of Trujillo&#x27;s consciousness (as the storyteller dares to conceive it).&quot;

Vargas Llosa also built an image of the regime with the troubled historical events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said &quot;It&#x27;s a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was that I was not going to invent anything that couldn&#x27;t have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive—and I have not exaggerated.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The realist style of &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; is recognized by some reviewers as being a break from a more allegorical approach to the dictator novel. The novel received largely positive reviews, most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Spectator&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Literary Review&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the novel an average rating of 9 out of 10 based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. According to Book Marks, primarily from American press, the book received a &quot;positive&quot; consensus, based on fourteen critic reviews: five &quot;rave&quot;, six &quot;positive&quot;, and three &quot;mixed.&quot; Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Almost all impressed -- an important, solid work&quot;.

A common comment on the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder, which are depicted in the novel. Vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime with a degree of detail not often used by his compatriots in Latin American literature, as Michael Wood suggests in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;: &quot;Vargas Llosa ... tells us far more about the details of day-to-day intrigue, and the sordid, sadistic minutiae of torture and murder.&quot; Walter Kirn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggests that the &quot;grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions&quot; cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light, draining them of their significance and impact. Similarly, Kirn implies that the &quot;narrative machinery&quot; mentioned by Wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline. The plot line centered on Urania Cabral is described by Sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel, and Wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention. In contrast, Kirn&#x27;s review states that Urania&#x27;s segments are &quot;talky and atmospheric ... [and] seem to be on loan from another sort of book.&quot;

Most reviews of &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; make either indirect of direct reference to the relationship between sexuality and power. &quot;Salon&quot; reviewer Laura Miller, writer for &quot;The Observer&quot; Jonathan Heawood, Walter Kirn, and Michael Wood each detail the connection between Trujillo&#x27;s gradual loss of ultimate control, both over his body and his followers. The means by which Trujillo reinforces political power through sexual acts and begins to lose personal conviction as his body fails him, are topics of frequent discussion among reviewers.

In 2011 Bernard Diederich, author of the 1978 non-fiction book &quot;Trujillo: The Death of the Goat&quot;, accused Vargas-Llosa of plagiarism.

==Adaptations==

An English-language film adaptation of the novel was made in 2005, directed by Luis Llosa, Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s cousin. It stars Isabella Rossellini as Urania Cabral, Paul Freeman as her father Agustin, Stephanie Leonidas as Uranita and Tomas Milian as Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. It was filmed in both the Dominican Republic and in Spain. Reviewing the film for the trade paper &quot;Variety&quot;, critic Jonathan Holland called it &quot;less a feast than a somewhat rushed, but thoroughly enjoyable, three-course meal&quot;, commenting that the main difference from the source novel was the sacrifice of psychological nuance.

The novel has also been adapted for the stage, by Jorge Alí Triana and his daughter Veronica Triana, directed by Jorge Triana: the play was put on (in Spanish, but with simultaneous translation to English) at Repertorio Español (www.repertorio.org/chivo) in New York in 2003; and the production moved to Lima in 2007. A feature of the novel&#x27;s stage version is that the same actor plays both Agustin Cabral and Rafael Trujillo. For reviewer Bruce Weber, this makes the point &quot;that Trujillo&#x27;s control of the nation depended on gutless collaborators&quot;.

<text>Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich (, ; 8 March 1914 – 2 December 1987), also known as YaB, was a leading Soviet physicist of Belarusian origin, who is known for his prolific contributions in physical cosmology, physics of thermonuclear reactions, combustion, and hydrodynamical phenomena.

From 1943, Zeldovich, a self-taught physicist, started his career by playing a crucial role in the development of the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons. In 1963, he returned to academia to embark on pioneering contributions on the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes and expanding the scope of physical cosmology.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Yakov Zeldovich was born into a Belarusian Jewish family in his grandfather&#x27;s house in Minsk. However, in mid-1914, the Zeldovich family moved to Saint Petersburg. They resided there until August 1941, when the family was evacuated together with the faculty of the Institute of Chemical Physics to Kazan to avoid the Axis Invasion of the Soviet Union. They remained in Kazan until the summer of 1943, when Zeldovich moved to Moscow.

His father, Boris Naumovich Zeldovich, was a lawyer; his mother, Anna Petrovna Zeldovich (née Kiveliovich), a translator from French to Russian, was a member of the Writer&#x27;s Union. Despite being born into a devoted and religious Jewish family, Zeldovich was an &quot;absolute atheist&quot;.

Zeldovich was an autodidact. He was regarded as having a remarkably versatile intellect, and during his life he explored and made major contributions to a wide range of scientific endeavors. From a given opportunity in May 1931, he secured an appointment as a laboratory assistant at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, and remained associated with the institute for the remainder of his life. As a laboratory assistant, he received preliminary instructions on the topics involved in the physical chemistry and built up his reputation among his seniors at the Institute of Chemical Physics.

From 1932 to 1934, Zeldovich attended the undergraduate courses on physics and mathematics at the Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University), and later attended the technical lectures on introductory physics at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute (now Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University).

In 1936, he was successful in his candidacy for the Candidate of Science degree (a Soviet equivalent of PhD), having successfully defended his dissertation on the topic of the &quot;adsorption and catalysis on heterogeneous surfaces&quot;. The centrality of his thesis focused towards the research on the &quot;Freundlich (or classical) adsorption isotherm&quot;, and Zeldovich discovered the theoretical foundation of this empirical observation.

In 1939, Zeldovich prepared his dissertation based on the mathematical theory of the physical interpretation of nitrogen oxidation, and successfully received the Doctor of Sciences in mathematical physics when it was reviewed by Alexander Frumkin. Zeldovich discovered its mechanism, known in physical chemistry as the thermal mechanism or Zeldovich mechanism.

===Soviet program of nuclear weapons===

Zeldovich is regarded as a secret principal of the Soviet nuclear weapons project; his travels abroad were highly restricted, to Eastern Europe, under close Soviet security. Soon after the discovery of nuclear fission (by German chemist Otto Hahn in 1939) Russian physicists had begun investigating the scope of nuclear-fission physics, and undertook seminars on that topic; Igor Kurchatov and Yulii Khariton were engaged in 1940.

In May 1941, Zeldovich worked with Khariton in constructing a theory, on the kinetics of nuclear reactions in the presence of the critical conditions. The work of Khariton and Zeldovich was extended into theories of ignition, combustion and detonation; these accounted for features which had not previously been correctly predicted, observed, nor explained. The modern theory of detonation accordingly is called the Zeldovich-von Neumann-Dohring, or ZND, theory, and its development involved tedious fast neutron calculations; this work had been delayed, due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which obstructed progress on findings that in June 1941 would be de-classified. In 1942, Zeldovich was relocated to Kazan, and tasked by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Munitions to carry out work on conventional gun powders to be supplied to the Soviet Army, while Khariton was asked to design the new types of conventional weaponry.

In 1943, Joseph Stalin decided to launch an arms build-up of nuclear weapons, under the charge of Igor Kurchatov; the latter requested Stalin to relocate Zeldovich and Khariton to Moscow, in the nuclear weapons program. Zeldovich joined Igor Kurchatov&#x27;s small team at this secretive laboratory in Moscow to launch the work on the nuclear combustion theory, and became a head of the theoretical department at the Arzamas-16 in 1946.

With Isaak Gurevich, Isaak Pomeranchuk, and Khariton, Zeldovich prepared a scientific report on the feasibility of releasing energy through nuclear fusion triggered by an atomic explosion, and presented it to Igor Kurchatov. Zeldovich had benefitted from physical and technical knowledge provided by German physicist Klaus Fuchs and American physicist Theodore Hall, who each had worked on the American Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons.

In 1949, Zeldovich led a team of physicists that conducted the first nuclear test, the RDS-1, based roughly on the American design obtained through the atomic spies in the United States, though he continued his fundamental work on explosive theory. Zeldovich then began working on modernizing the successive designs of the nuclear weapon and initially conceived the idea of hydrogen bomb to Andrei Sakharov and others. In the course of his work on nuclear weapons, Zeldovich did ground-breaking work in radiation hydrodynamics, and the physics of matter at high pressure.

Between 1950 and 1953, Zeldovich performed calculations necessary for the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb that were verified by Andrei Sakharov, although the two groups worked in parallel on the development of the thermonuclear fusion. However, it was Sakharov that radically changed the approach to thermonuclear fusion, aided by Vitaly Ginzburg in 1952. He remained associated with the nuclear testing program, while heading the experimental laboratories at Arzamas-16 until October 1963, when he left for academia.

==Academia and cosmology==

In 1952, Zeldovich began work in the field of elementary particles and their transformations. He predicted the beta decay of a pi meson. Together with Semyon Gershtein he noticed the analogy between the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and in 1960, he predicted the muon catalysis (more precisely, the muon-catalysed dt-fusion) phenomenon. In 1977, Zeldovich together with was awarded the Kurchatov Medal, the highest award in nuclear physics of the Soviet Union. The citation was &quot;for prediction of characteristics of ultracold neutrons, their detection and investigation&quot;. He was elected academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 20 June 1958. He was a head of division at the Institute of the Applied Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1965 until January 1983.
In early 1960s, Zeldovich started working in astrophysics and physical cosmology. In 1964, he and independently Edwin Salpeter were the first to suggest that accretion discs around massive black holes are responsible for the huge amounts of energy radiated by quasars. From 1965, he was a professor at the Department of Physics of the Moscow State University and a head of the division of Relativistic Astrophysics at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute. In 1966, he and Igor Novikov were the first to propose searching for black hole candidates among binary systems in which one star is optically bright and X-ray dark and the other optically dark but X-ray bright (the black hole candidate).

Zeldovich worked on the theory of the evolution of the hot universe, the properties of the microwave background radiation, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the theory of black holes. He predicted, with Rashid Sunyaev, that the cosmic microwave background should undergo inverse Compton scattering. This is called the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and measurements by telescopes such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope has established it as one of the key observational probes of cluster cosmology. Zeldovich contributed sharp insights into the nature of the large scale structure of the universe, in particular, through the use of Lagrangian perturbation theory (the Zeldovich approximation) and the application of the Burgers&#x27; equation approach via the adhesion approximation.

In 1974, in collaboration with A. G. Polnarev, suggested the existence of a gravitational memory effect, for which a system of freely falling particles initially at relative rest are displaced after the passing of a burst of gravitational radiation.

===Black hole thermodynamics===

Zeldovich played a key role in developing the theory of black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation. Zeldovich and Charles W. Misner concomitantly predicted the possibility of particle generation by rotating Kerr black holes in 1971, 1972. Previously, In 1965, Zeldovich had predicted that Kerr black holes would split the emission lines of photons as in a Zeeman effect. During Stephen Hawking&#x27;s visit to Moscow in 1973, Soviet scientists Zeldovich and Alexei Starobinsky showed Hawking that, according to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle, rotating black holes should create and emit particles.

==Family==
With his wife, Varvara Pavlovna Konstantinova, Yakov Zeldovich had a son and two daughters who were also physicists: son – Boris Zeldovich; daughters – Olga Yakovlevna Zeldovich and Marina Yakovlevna Zeldovich.

Zeldovich also had a daughter, Annushka, with O.K. Shiryaeva.

He had one more daughter in 1945, Alexandra Varkovitskaya, with a linguist and folklorist Ludmila Varkovitskaya.

Zeldovich had another son with Nina Nikolaevna Agapova in 1958, whose name was Leonid Yakovlevich Agapov; he died in 2016 at the age of 58.

<text>Yulii Borisovich Khariton (; 27 February 1904 – 18 December 1996) was a Russian physicist who was a leading scientist in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons.

Since the initiation of the Soviet program of developing the atomic bomb by Joseph Stalin in 1943, Khariton was the &quot;chief nuclear weapon designer&quot; and remained associated with the Soviet program for nearly four decades. In honour of the centennial of his birthday in 2004, his image appeared on a Russian postal stamp by the Russian government.

==Biography==
===Family, early life and education===

Yulii Borisovich Khariton was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, to an ethnic middle class Russian Jewish family, on 27 February 1904. His father, Boris Osipovich Khariton, was a political journalist, editor, and publisher who had attained a law degree from Kiev University in Ukraine. His father worked for the newspaper &quot;Rech&quot;, the main organ of the Constitutional Democratic Party, and was a well known figure in the political circles of Russia. After the Russian revolution dismantled the Tsarist autocracy in 1917, Boris Khariton had clashes with the Bolsheviks due to his opposition to Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Soviet ideology. His father was exiled to the Baltic states from Russia in 1922 at the age of forty six along with professors and journalists on one of the so-called Philosophers&#x27; ships, subsequently working for an emigrant newspaper in Latvia.

His father, Boris Khariton, remained there until Latvia&#x27;s annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940 and, at the age of sixty-four, was then arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to seven years of forced labour in a Gulag, where he died.

Yulii&#x27;s mother, Mirra Yakovlevna Burovskaya, was a theatre actress who performed at the Moscow Art Theatre. She left Russia in 1910 due to an illness that had to be treated at the European resort. Yulii was six years old when his mother left him and was taken care by an Estonian woman, hired by his father while in exile in Latvia. Yulii&#x27;s mother never returned to Russia and divorced his father, only to marry her psychiatrist, Dr. Max Eitingon.

Having lived in Germany, Mirra moved to Tel Aviv in Palestine in 1933, where she remained until her death. She is buried in Jerusalem.

Yulii was forbidden to contact his parents after he had started classified work in the Soviet Union. His travels were highly restricted by the Soviet Union and later by Russia.

Yulii was home schooled by his Estonian housekeeper, hired by his father, who taught him the German language. At the age of eleven, he began attending regular school. In Saint Petersburg, he went to attend a trade school which he completed at the age of fifteen and found work at a local mechanical workshop where he learned how to operate various machinery as a machinist.

In 1920, he enrolled in the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute to study mechanical engineering but later chose to study physics, which he found to be more stimulating. He studied physics under Russian physicists, Abram Ioffe, Nikolay Semyonov, and Alexander Friedmann. Khariton was particularly fascinated with the work of Semyonov whose research used the techniques of physics in chemistry, which Semyonov called &quot;chemical physics.&quot;. Khariton&#x27;s talent was recognised by Semyonov who supported his research project in investigations of the light-emitting ability of phosphorus combined with oxygen, and reported the results in both the German and Russian languages. In 1926, Khariton completed his degree in physics from the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute and ended his research project as he prepared for his first foreign trip to England. 

Before departing, he was introduced to Pyotr Kapitsa by Semyonov who asked the latter to help Yulii secure a fellowship at the Cavendish Laboratory in England. In England, Khariton attended the University of Cambridge to do his doctoral in physics under Ernest Rutherford in 1926. At Cambridge, he worked with James Chadwick on investigating the sensitivity of the eye with respect to weak light impulses and alpha radiation. Khariton earned his PhD in 1928 from Cambridge University.

===Soviet program of nuclear weapons===

In 1928, Khariton decided to take up the residence in (Germany) to be near his mother, but was appalled and frightened by the political propaganda of the Nazi Party in Germany; therefore returning to Soviet Union while his mother left for Palestine.

In 1931, he joined the Institute of Chemical Physics and eventually headed the explosion laboratory until 1946, working closely with another Russian physicist Yakov Zeldovich, on exothermic chemical chain reactions.

In 1935, he received his doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences. During this period, Khariton and Zeldovich conducted experiments on the chain reactions of uranium. In August 1939, Zeldovich, Khariton and Aleksandr Leipunskii delivered papers on the theoretical process behind nuclear fission chain reactions at a conference in Kharkiv, Ukraine; this was the last pre-war discussion of chain reactions in the USSR.

During World War II, Khariton&#x27;s knowledge of the physics of explosions was used in experimental studies on Soviet and foreign weaponry, while continuing his leadership of the Institute of Chemical Physics.

Physicist Igor Kurchatov asked Khariton to become part of the Soviet atomic project in 1943, in Laboratory No. 2 of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In May 1945, as part of a team of physicists sent to Berlin to investigate Nazi atomic bomb research, Khariton found 100 tonnes of uranium oxide, which was transported back to Moscow; this reduced development time for domestic plutonium production. After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a Special Committee was established including Kurchatov and Khariton. Khariton was made scientific director of KB-11 (design bureau-11) also known as Arzamas-16 and colloquially as the &#x27;Installation&#x27;, located in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast to develop Soviet nuclear weapons (the organisation is now known as the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF). Khariton remained as its scientific director for 46 years. Along with other senior scientists, he was regarded as too important to fly and had his own private train carriage. He was elected as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1946, and as a full member in 1953.

In 1949, he and Kirill Shchelkin reported to the Special Committee on the progress of the first Soviet nuclear weapon, the RDS-1, which was tested on 29 August that year. He was deferential to political superiors but supported the scientists under him in a politic and diplomatic way. Physicist and departmental head Andrei Sakharov referred to him as being &quot;zealous and unsparing of himself.&quot;; he spoke for scientists when they changed their focus to a two-stage nuclear device with initial compression from 1954 (the RDS-37) and supported requests not to detonate the RDS-220 (the largest-ever bomb) because of the calculated number of deaths due to radioactive fallout. He would not support similar requests to halt a duplicate test by a second &#x27;Installation&#x27; at Snezhinsk which he felt was divisive, and wouldn&#x27;t intercede in certain politically-charged personal cases.

His diplomacy meant absorbing criticism and put-downs from political leaders who came and went. KB-11 was sometimes sneered at for having a significant number of staff with Jewish backgrounds, Khariton included. The second Installation under Yevgeny Zababakhin had fewer, and there had been awkward professional relations; it was comically referred to as &quot;Egypt&quot; by politicians, with obvious comparative implications with KB-11: the dining room at KB-11 was termed &#x27;the synagogue.&#x27;

<text>Chelyabinsk Oblast is a federal subject (an oblast) of Russia in the Ural Mountains region, on the border of Europe and Asia. Its administrative center is the city of Chelyabinsk.

==History==
During the Middle Ages, Bashkir tribes inhabited the Southern Urals; they formed part of the Golden Horde, Nogai Horde, and smaller Bashkir unions. The Tsardom of Russia incorporated the area in the late 16th century. However, Russian colonization of the region only began in the 18th century, with the establishment of a system of fortresses and trade posts on the then-Russian border by the in 1734. Many cities of Chelyabinsk Oblast, including the city of Chelyabinsk itself, trace their history back to those forts.

In 1743 the Chelyabinsk fortress became a center of the , a constituent part of the Orenburg Governorate (a direct successor of the Orenburg Expedition). The period from the 1750s to the 1770s saw the emergence of industrial enterprises in the Southern Urals when the first factory-centered towns like Miass, Kyshtym, and Zlatoust were founded. After the Southern Urals recovered from the Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion of 1773–1775, the territory of modern-day Chelyabinsk Oblast started to attract more people from the European part of Russia. By the mid-19th century Chelyabinsk was a major trade center in the Urals, and after the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s, it became an important transport hub that connected Siberia to the rest of the Russian Empire.

In 1919, Chelyabinsk became the regional capital of the newly formed Chelyabinsk Governorate of the Russian SFSR, which combined eastern portions of the Orenburg Governorate with Kurgan of the Tobolsk Governorate. At this time, the population of the new region has already exceeded one million people. In 1923, together with the Perm, and Tyumen governorates, it merged into a single Ural Oblast that lasted only ten years, until 1934. On 17 January 1934, Chelyabinsk Oblast was finally established. Its current boundaries were formed when Kurgan Oblast was detached from it in 1943.

===Soviet industrialization===
During the 1930s the regional economy and industrial output grew as Chelyabinsk Oblast became a key focus of the First Five-Year Plan. Key factories and enterprises that formed the core of the modern Chelyabinsk economy, including the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, originated at this time. The economy continued to grow after the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, as industries evacuated from the western parts of the Soviet Union to the Urals, and to Chelyabinsk Oblast in particular. During the war, Magnitogorsk alone produced one third of all Soviet steel, while the city of Chelyabinsk became the main center of Soviet tank production, earning the nickname &quot;Tankograd&quot; (Tank City).

===Nuclear research===
Chelyabinsk Oblast has been home to top-secret nuclear research since the 1940s. While there are no nuclear power stations in Chelyabinsk, a number of production reactors were located there starting with the early Cold War. A serious nuclear accident occurred in 1957 at the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, north-west of the city, which led to evacuations and fatalities throughout the oblast, although not in Chelyabinsk city. The province was closed to all foreigners until 1992, with the sole exception of allowing a British medical team in following a two-train rail explosion in the mid-1980s.

Sławomir Grünberg has made the documentary &quot;Chelyabinsk: The Most Contaminated Spot on the Planet&quot; (1994) about the unsafe dumping of radioactive waste in the Techa River and in Lake Karachay.

===Recent history===
On 4 July 1997, Chelyabinsk, alongside Bryansk, Magadan, Saratov, and Vologda signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement would be abolished on 2 February 2002.

On 15 February 2013, a 10,000 ton meteoroid entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over Russia at about 09:20 YEKT (03:20 UTC). It passed over the southern Ural region and exploded in a meteor air burst over Chelyabinsk Oblast. About 1,500 people were reported injured, including 311 children. Health officials said 112 people had been hospitalized, mainly from injuries caused by glass from windows shattered by a shock wave; two were reported to be in serious condition. As many as 3,000 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion and impacts. The meteor created a dazzling light as it air burst, bright enough to cast shadows during broad daylight in Chelyabinsk.

==Economy==
The largest companies in the region include Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant (Mechel group), Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant, Chelyabinsk Electrometallurgical Plant, Chelyabinsk Zinc Plant, Ashinsky Metallurgical Plant.

==Geography==
Chelyabinsk Oblast is on the eastern slope of the Southern Urals. Only a small part of the territory to the west is on the western slopes of the Southern Urals.

Chelyabinsk Oblast is situated in the Southern Urals, near Kurgan and Sverdlovsk oblast. Most of the Oblast is located to the east of the Ural Mountains, which form the continental boundary between Asia and Europe. This boundary is marked by a stone pillar at the Uraltau pass near the Urzhumka station ( from Zlatoust), which has &quot;Europe&quot; written on one side and &quot;Asia&quot; on the other. In Chelyabinsk Oblast, Zlatoust city, Katav-Ivanovsk, and Satka and Chelyabinsk, Troitsk, and Miass are in Europe. Magnitogorsk is located on both continents.

The area of Chelyabinsk Oblast is . The total length of its external border is , and the Oblast measures from north to south and from west to east.

The highest point of Chelyabinsk Oblast, reaching above sea level, is located in the Nurgush, a long mountain range rising near lake Zyuratkul.

It also borders the country of Kazakhstan, specifically the Kostanay Region.

===Relief===
Chelyabinsk Oblast has a very diverse landscape, ranging from lowlands and hilly plains to mountain ranges with peaks exceeding 1,000 m, including Nurgush mountain (1406 m). The mountainous area has several ski resorts.

The West Siberian Plain is bounded on the west horizontal (elevation 190 m above sea level), which passes through the village of Bagaryak, Kunashak and continues through Chelyabinsk to the south. The lowlands are located in the northeast, and the elevation drops to 130 m in the eastern border region.

===Hydrology===
Numerous rivers originate within the region, within the basins of the Kama, Tobol, and Ural rivers. The region is home to 348 rivers longer than (totaling in length), 17 of which are over in length. Seven rivers, the Miass, Uy, Ural, Ay, Ufa, Uvelka, and Gumbeyka, pass through the area and are longer than .
Chelyabinsk Oblast is also home to more than 3,748 lakes, mostly located in the north and east and covering a total area of . Many of the lakes in this area, including Lake Turgoyak, Zyuratkul, and Lake Itkul, are famous for their clear waters and attract tourism. Some of the lakes in the eastern foothills have tectonic origins as water accumulated in tectonic failures (basins), resulting in very deep lakes that can reach .

==Sights==
===Taganay National Park===
Taganay National Park is located northeast of the city of Zlatoust, Chelyabinsk Oblast. Taganay National Park is a popular tourist destination in the Urals. The park contains mountain ranges, alpine meadows, stone outcrops and a several kilometer stone river, forests, woodlands and mountain tundra, ancient mineral mines and mountain rivers flowing both to Europe and Asia. Taganay National Park was established on 5 March 1991, the first in the Urals.

===Gagarin Park===
Gagarin Central Park is a 12-hectare recreational space in Chelyabinsk. The park is named after Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut and the first person to enter space. The park contains forest walks, lakes, old quarries, and landscaped gardens. There is also a showground with rides.

=== Monuments ===
There are several monuments in Chelyabinsk, many of which are on Kirovka street, a pedestrian street in the center of Chelyabinsk. The monuments include a monument to Igor Kurchatov, a nuclear scientist, which opened in 1986 to the 250th anniversary of Chelyabinsk; a monument to Orlenok, on the Aloe polye in Chelyabinsk, which opened on 29 October 1958 on the day of the fortieth anniversary of the Komsomol; the Sculpture of the Postman; the Memorial to Law and Order Soldiers; the Monument to Soldiers-Internationalists; and a sculpture of a firefighter.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the highest authority in the Oblast was shared between three positions: the First Secretary of the Chelyabinsk CPSU Committee (who held the most power), the Chairman of the Oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power.

Today, the Charter of Chelyabinsk Oblast governs the political structure of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Chelyabinsk Oblast serves as the province&#x27;s regional parliament and exercises legislative authority, with the power to pass laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and oversee their implementation and observance. The Oblast Government, led by the Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast, is the highest executive body in the region, and includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province.

<text>Teterboro Airport is a general aviation relief airport situated in the boroughs of Teterboro, Moonachie, and Hasbrouck Heights in Bergen County, New Jersey. It is owned and managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and operated by AFCO AvPORTS Management. The airport is in the New Jersey Meadowlands, north-northwest of Midtown Manhattan, making it popular for private and corporate aircraft. The airport has a weight limit of on aircraft, making it nonviable for any commercial service.

The airport takes up almost all of Teterboro and consists of : for aircraft hangar and offices, for aeronautical use and runways, and undeveloped. The airport has more than 1,137 employees, of whom more than 90% work full-time.

In April 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the airport had the third-highest rate of wildlife strikes of any airport in the United States, based on takeoffs and landings (43 per 100,000).

Teterboro is home to many private aviation charter companies flying both nationally and globally.

==History==
Teterboro Airport is the oldest operating airport in the New York City area. Walter C. Teter (1863–1929) acquired the property in 1917, and North American Aviation operated a manufacturing plant on the site during World War I. After the war, the airport served as a base of operations for Anthony Fokker, the Dutch aircraft designer. The first flight from the present airport site was made in 1919. In 1926,
Colonial Air Transport at Teterboro was the first private company to deliver mail by air.

During World War II, the United States Army operated at the airport. The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey purchased it on April 1, 1949, from Fred L. Wehran, a private owner, and later leased it to Pan American World Airways (and its successor organization Johnson Controls) for 30 years until December 1, 2000, when the Port Authority assumed full responsibility for the operation of Teterboro.

Since 1977, aircraft greater than are not allowed to take off from Teterboro, effectively banning commercial service. In 2003, U.S. Congressman Steve Rothman helped authorize a federal bill codifying the ban, citing excessive noise in the surrounding residential areas.

===Recent statistics===
In 2019, Teterboro Airport trailed Republic Airport in total number of aircraft operations by 46,047 (173,625 at TEB vs 219,672 at FRG), making it the second busiest general aviation airport in the region and fifth busiest airport when including operations from Kennedy Airport (463,198), Newark Airport (449,543), and LaGuardia Airport (374,539).

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport saw a significant drop in total number of aircraft operations, with a reduction in traffic to 86,465 (difference in 87,160 flights); however, Teterboro leads Republic Airport in transient flights, while Republic has more local general aviation traffic, with 165,250 flights during the pandemic.

==Facilities==
Teterboro Airport covers at an elevation of .

===Buildings===
Nineteen hangars on the airport have a total area of about .

Two large office buildings are centrally located, one at 90 Moonachie Avenue, and the other on Fred Wehran Drive, which houses the Department of Homeland Security. Both buildings have a total area of .

Additional office and shop space totals an area of . There is also an operations building, maintenance facility, and two fuel farms.

The airport contains the Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey.

===Control tower===
The control tower was built on the east side of the airport by the FAA, and went into operation on October 29, 1975. The original control tower is not operational, but is still part of the original wooden Atlantic Aviation hangar on Industrial Avenue. It is in the northeast corner of the hangar.

===Runways===
Runway 6-24 is long and wide, with High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL). Runway 6 approach has an Instrument Landing System (ILS), and a Medium Approach Lighting System-R (MALS-R). Runway 24 approach is equipped with both a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) and Runway End Identification Lights (REIL) systems. Runway 6-24 underwent complete overlay and grooving in 1987.

Runway 1-19 is long and wide, with HIRL. Both runways 1 and 19 are equipped with REIL systems. Runway 1 approach is equipped with a VASI system. Runway 19 approach has an ILS, and a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI). Runway 1-19 was overlaid and grooved in the summer of 2000, and included the installation of centerline and touchdown zone lighting. Runway 19 is the preferred runway for noise abatement procedures.

===Taxiways===
About of taxiways exist on the airport. Most are wide and have centerline and edge lighting.

===Aircraft===
In 2017, the airport had 178,369 aircraft operations, averaging 488 per day: 65.6% general aviation, 34% air taxi, 0.3% military, and &lt;1% airline. 121 aircraft were then based at this airport: 81% jet, 10.7% helicopter, 6.6% single-engine, and 1.7% multi-engine.

===Other===
The Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey is on the airport grounds. Founded in 1972, it is the first state aviation hall of fame in the nation, honoring the men and women who brought outstanding aeronautical achievements to the state. The museum offers visitors an opportunity to view historic air and space equipment and artifacts, photographs, fine art and an extensive model collection. The library has more than 4,000 volumes and hundreds of aviation video tapes.

== Public transportation ==
Teterboro Airport can be reached from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on New Jersey Transit bus routes 161 (regular service), 165 (limited weekday service) and 144 (peak periods weekdays). The Teterboro station is the closest rail station along NJ Transit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line, but Wood-Ridge station, along the same route, is also close to the southwest of the airport.

==Notable incidents==

In 1956 and again in 1958, Thomas Fitzpatrick flew stolen aircraft from Teterboro and landed them along city streets in the Hudson Heights, Manhattan neighborhood.

In June 1966, in Hasbrouck Heights, a two-engine Piper Aztec going to Teterboro Airport crashed, striking a tree and narrowly missing homes on Burton Avenue near U.S. Route 46 (US 46). The pilot sustained injuries including a skull fracture and was taken to Hackensack Hospital by ambulance. He was carrying film for Eastman Kodak.

On September 23, 1981, a Ronson Aviation Bell 206B helicopter and a Seminole Air Charier Piper PA-34 airplane collided in flight over East Rutherford, about south of Teterboro Airport. The airplane had a flight plan to Teterboro from Syracuse, New York. The helicopter was inbound to Teterboro from Woodbridge, NJ. The two collided at an altitude of about . The helicopter fell into the Meadowlands Sports Complex parking lot, and both persons aboard were killed. The airplane, with about of its left wing and its right engine missing, made a gear-up landing in a marsh about east of the collision point. The pilot was seriously injured, and the passenger received minor injuries.

On December 9, 1999, a small plane crashed between two houses in neighboring Hasbrouck Heights, killing all four people aboard, injuring three people on the ground and setting a garage on fire.

On March 9, 2002 a single-engine Cessna 210 with a flight plan to Montauk, NY, crashed shortly after takeoff about 2 p.m. killing the only occupant and pilot. Upon impact the plane skidded about before it burst into flames, narrowly missing cars on US 46 about away.

On September 9, 2002, a Piper Saratoga carrying a Canadian family took off from Teterboro Airport and crashed into a housing development in Hunterdon County 10 minutes later. The parents were killed, and the two children were critically injured. The incident caused millions in damage.

On February 2, 2005 at 7:18 a.m., a Bombardier Challenger CL-600-1A11, N370V, hurtled off a runway at Teterboro Airport, skidded across US 46 and slammed into a warehouse during the morning rush, injuring 20 people, 11 of them on the plane. The two pilots were seriously injured, as were two occupants in a vehicle. The cabin aide, eight passengers, and one person in the building received minor injuries. Five people remained hospitalized, one of them gravely injured. A 66-year-old Paterson man who was riding in a car the jet struck was on life support, authorities said. Later that year, Congress passed legislation authored by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg that directed the FAA to install arrestor beds at all U.S. airports.

On September 2, 2005 at 21:22 local time, a Cessna 177A, N30491, crashed in South Hackensack during an emergency landing at Teterboro airport. A Teterboro employee observed the plane descending toward runway 24, lost sight of it as it descended below the horizon, then saw two or three bright flashes. The pilot sustained fatal injuries and the passenger serious injuries.

On October 11, 2006 a Cirrus SR20 took off from Teterboro and crashed in New York City at 2:42 pm local time. The aircraft struck the north side of an apartment building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan; it caused a fire in two apartments on the 40th and 41st floors, which was extinguished within an hour. The aircraft was owned and piloted by New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, who died in the accident along with his flight instructor. As a result of this accident the FAA established restrictions on flying up the East River.

Two midair collisions have occurred over the Hudson River involving aircraft that departed from Teterboro, one in 1976, and one in 2009. As a result of the later accident the FAA came up with new guidelines for pilots flying the Hudson River, including mandatory reporting points and separating slower helicopter traffic from faster fixed-wing traffic via assigned altitude blocks.

On August 21, 2009, around 3:00 a.m., a Beechcraft Baron crashed while attempting to land. The pilot and passenger survived but sustained burns requiring the attention of Saint Barnabas Medical Center&#x27;s burn unit, the only one in the state of New Jersey. The plane was believed to have originated at Reading, PA, and was carrying blood samples for Quest Diagnostics, which has a lab on property adjacent to Teterboro Airport.

On December 20, 2011, a single-engine TBM700 crashed on Interstate 287 near Morristown after leaving Teterboro Airport headed for Georgia. Five people, including a family of four and one other passenger, were killed.

On May 15, 2017 at about 3:30 p.m., a Learjet 35 stalled and crashed about away while approaching Runway 1. The pilot and co-pilot were killed; no others were on board. It had departed Philadelphia International Airport shortly before. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) safety recommendations from this accident included a requirement for &quot;operators to establish programs for flight crewmembers who have demonstrated performance deficiencies or experienced failures during training and administer additional oversight and training to address and correct performance deficiencies.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In January 1954, Arthur Godfrey buzzed the Teterboro control tower with his Douglas DC-3, resulting in a six-month suspension of his license. Godfrey claimed that windy conditions forced him to turn immediately after takeoff when, in fact, he was angry with the tower due to him not getting clearance on the runway that he requested. Seven years later, in 1961, Godfrey recorded a satirical song about the incident called &quot;Teterboro Tower.&quot; The song, performed roughly to the tune of &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;, was released as a 45-RPM single by Contempo Records.

On July 24, 1973, Bob Gruen photographed Led Zeppelin in front of &quot;The Starship&quot;, the band&#x27;s private Boeing 720 passenger jet, before it departed for a live performance at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The photo is considered an iconic shot of the band.

In the final scene of the 1994 film &quot;Wolf&quot;, Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s character, Laura Alden, tells detectives that Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character, Will Randall, is most likely on his way to Teterboro Airport. Moments later, a detective confirms that a plane chartered by Alden is waiting at the airport.

The airport can be seen in two episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. In the first episode of the second season, the airport can be seen in the background of a driving scene, doubling as Newark Liberty International Airport. The airport is also seen and mentioned, by name, in the series finale.

In 2003, Jay-Z coined the nickname &quot;clearport&quot; for Teterboro on his song &quot;Excuse Me Miss&quot;, in reference to Teterboro having less traffic than other major commercial airports in the New York metropolitan area.

In the 2014 sports drama film &quot;Draft Day&quot;, the character of Anthony Molina, the fictional owner of the Cleveland Browns, demands to be driven to Teterboro Airport from the NFL Draft in Manhattan.

The airport is mentioned as a potential emergency landing location for US Airways Flight 1549 in the 2016 biographical drama film &quot;Sully&quot;, as it was in the true life 2009 event the film is based on.

In the first season finale of the 2021 television series &quot;Chucky&quot;, the airport is mentioned as the destination for a truckload of Good Guy dolls.

In the 2022 film &quot;Uncharted&quot;, the characters Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan travel to Barcelona via Teterboro Airport. 

In May 2022, the airport was used as a location in the fourth episode of the Netflix comedy series, &quot;The Pentaverate&quot; when a helicopter piloted by the Mike Myers character, Ken Scarborough, is remotely controlled to land at Teterboro Airport. 

In the debut issue of &quot;New Fantastic Four&quot;, published by Marvel Comics in June 2022, Wolverine informs Spider-Man that he has a cab waiting to bring them to Teterboro Airport.

<doc id="475232" wikidata="Q2252893" url="?curid=475232" title="The Rest of the Robots">
<text>The Rest of the Robots is a collection of eight short stories and two full-length novels by American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1964. The stories, centred on positronic robots, are all part of the &quot;Robot&quot; series, most of which take place in the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe. Another collection of short stories about robots, &quot;I, Robot&quot;, was re-published in the previous year, which is why Asimov chose to title the collection as &quot;The Rest of the Robots&quot;. None of the short stories in this collection were in &quot;I, Robot&quot;, however all of them were later included in &quot;The Complete Robot&quot;, and both novels about Elijah Baley were also published separately.

The texts in the collection were grouped into four chapters, differentiating their central themes. The first chapter, &quot;The Coming of the Robots&quot;, included some of Asimov&#x27;s earliest robot stories, where the Three Laws of Robotics were not yet explicitly defined.

The following chapter, &quot;The Laws of Robotics&quot;, included stories that were written after the explicit formulation of the three laws, however both stories include elements that place them outside the Foundation universe. In the story &quot;First Law&quot;, aliens and direct disobedience of the First Law of Robotics are described, while in the other story, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;, robots are used as weapons in the Cold War. The story &quot;Victory Unintentional&quot; in the first chapter also falls outside the Foundation canon, due to the mention of aliens.

The third chapter, &quot;Susan Calvin&quot; includes stories where robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin makes an appearance. These four stories are representative of Asimov&#x27;s robot short stories, following his traditional themes of aversion and distrust of robots by the general public and issues arising from the robots&#x27; interpretation of the Three Laws. The final chapter, titled &quot;Lije Baley&quot;, consists of the two novels with detective Elijah Baley, whom Asimov affectionately calls Lije.

While the original hardcover edition of this book included the two novels, some paperback editions have included only the eight short stories. Some of these shorter paperback editions, but not all, have been called &quot;Eight Stories from the Rest of the Robots&quot;.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in June 1965 praised the collection as &quot;a fine book of entertainment,&quot; but faulted Asimov&#x27;s extensive annotations, saying they &quot;[suck] the juice out of some very vivacious writing indeed, and [embalm] one of science fiction&#x27;s most ebullient personalities.&quot; In February 1966 he named the book &quot;the single most useful publishing idea of the year&quot;.

<doc id="475235" wikidata="Q161402" url="?curid=475235" title="Over the Rainbow">
<text>&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, also known as &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;, is a ballad by Harold Arlen with lyrics by Yip Harburg. It was written for the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which it was sung by actress Judy Garland in her starring role as Dorothy Gale. 

About five minutes into the film, Dorothy sings the song after failing to get Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands to listen to her story of an unpleasant incident involving her dog, Toto, and the town spinster, Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton). Aunt Em tells her to &quot;find yourself a place where you won&#x27;t get into any trouble&quot;. This prompts her to walk off by herself, musing to Toto, &quot;Someplace where there isn&#x27;t any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It&#x27;s not a place you can get to by a boat, or a train. It&#x27;s far, far away. Behind the moon, beyond the rain&quot;, at which point she begins singing.

&quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Garland&#x27;s signature song. It has been included in several all-time lists, and has been covered by several artists in varying languages. In 2017, it was selected for induction into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
Composer Harold Arlen and lyricist Yip Harburg often worked in tandem, Harburg generally suggesting an idea or title for Arlen to set to music, before Harburg contributed the lyrics. For their work together on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Harburg claimed his inspiration was &quot;a ballad for a little girl who... was in trouble and... wanted to get away from... Kansas. A dry, arid, colorless place. She had never seen anything colorful in her life except the rainbow&quot;. Arlen decided the idea needed &quot;a melody with a long broad line&quot;.

By the time all the other songs for the film had been written, Arlen was feeling the pressure of not having the song for the Kansas scene. He often carried blank pieces of music manuscript in his pockets to jot down short melodic ideas. Arlen described how the inspiration for the melody to &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; came to him suddenly while his wife Anya drove:

&quot;I said to Mrs. Arlen... &#x27;let&#x27;s go to Grauman&#x27;s Chinese ... You drive the car, I don&#x27;t feel too well right now.&#x27; I wasn&#x27;t thinking of work. I wasn&#x27;t consciously thinking of work, I just wanted to relax. And as we drove by Schwab&#x27;s Drug Store on Sunset I said, &#x27;Pull over, please.&#x27; ... And we stopped and I really don&#x27;t know why—bless the muses—and I took out my little bit of manuscript and put down what you know now as &#x27;Over the Rainbow.&#x27;&quot;

The song was originally sung in A-flat major. Arlen later wrote the contrasting bridge section based on the idea of &quot;a child&#x27;s piano exercise&quot;. In the movie, a renowned Stradivarius violin was used in the accompaniment.

Italian newspaper &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; has noted a resemblance, both harmonic and melodic, between &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and the theme of the intermezzo (known as Ratcliff&#x27;s Dream) of Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s 1895 opera &quot;Guglielmo Ratcliff&quot;.

==Recordings by Judy Garland==

On October 7, 1938, Judy Garland recorded the song on the MGM soundstage with an arrangement by Murray Cutter.

In July 1939, Garland recorded the song for Decca. It was this recording, not the one from the film soundtrack, that was released on the 78-rpm gramophone record that was part of the Decca four-record album titled &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Although this isn&#x27;t the version that appeared in the film, the &quot;studio cast album&quot; was commercially successful, and Decca continued to release it into the 1960s, also reissuing on 33 rpm.

The film version of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was unavailable for purchase on record until the &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; soundtrack album was released by MGM in 1956 to coincide with the television premiere of the movie. The soundtrack album has been re-released several times over the years, including a deluxe edition issued on Rhino Records in 1995.

After the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; appeared in 1939, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; became Garland&#x27;s signature song. She performed it for thirty years and sang it in the same way as she did for the film. She said she wanted to remain true to the character of Dorothy and to the message of being somewhere over the rainbow.

In 1981, Judy Garland&#x27;s original 1939 Decca gramophone record of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Other lyrics==
An introductory verse (&quot;When all the world is a hopeless jumble...&quot;) that was omitted from the film is sometimes used in theatrical productions of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and is included in the piano sheet music from the film. It was used in versions by Cliff Edwards, Tony Bennett, Al Bowlly, Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Mandy Patinkin, Trisha Yearwood, Melissa Manchester, Hilary Kole, Jewel, Eva Cassidy, and Norma Waterson. Judy Garland sang the introductory verse at least once, on a 1948 radio broadcast of &quot;The Louella Parsons Show&quot;. Lyrics for a second verse (&quot;Once by a word only lightly spoken...&quot;) appeared in the British edition of the sheet music.

==Awards and honors==
In March 2017, Judy Garland&#x27;s 1939 Decca single was entered in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as music that is &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) ranked it number one on their Songs of the Century list. The American Film Institute named it best movie song on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs list.

&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was given the Towering Song Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was sung at its dinner on June 12, 2014, by Jackie Evancho. In April 2005, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Yip Harburg that includes a lyric.

It was sent as an audio wakeup call to astronauts aboard the STS-88 space shuttle mission on Flight Day 4, dedicated to astronaut Robert D. Cabana by his daughter Sara.

According to his family, Gene Wilder died while listening to &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; sung by Ella Fitzgerald, one of his favorite songs.

==German versions==
The first German version in the English language was recorded by the Swing Orchestra Heinz Wehner (1908–1945) in March 1940 in Berlin. Wehner, at this time a well-known international German swing artist, also took over the vocals. The first German version in German language was sung by Inge Brandenburg (1929–1999) in 1960.

==Israel Kamakawiwoʻole version==

===Recording session===
On the album &quot;Facing Future&quot; (1993), Israel Kamakawiwoʻole included &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; in a ukulele medley with &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; by Louis Armstrong. At 3a.m one morning in 1988, Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole called a recording studio to request a session. Its owner and engineer, Milan Bertosa, agreed to record him if he could get there in 15 minutes.

Bertosa said, &quot;And in walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on.&quot; A security guard gave Israel a large steel chair. &quot;Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is &#x27;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&#x27; He played and sang, one take, and it was over.&quot;

Bertosa hung onto that tape and when Kamakawiwoʻole was recording &quot;Facing Future&quot; five years later he suggested that the song be included on that album, which went on to become the best-selling Hawaiian album of all time.

=== Chart activity and sales ===
Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s version reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Digital Tracks chart during the week of January 31, 2004 (for the survey week ending January 18, 2004). In the U.S., it was certified Platinum for million downloads sold. As of October 2014 it had sold over 4.2 million digital copies.

In the UK his version was released as a single under the title &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;. It entered the UK Official Singles Chart in April 2007 at number 68. In Germany, the single also returned to the German Singles Chart in September 2010. After two weeks on that chart, it received gold status for selling 150,000 copies. In October 2010, it reached number one on the German charts. In 2011 was certified 5× gold for selling over 750,000 copies. It stayed at the top spot for twelve non-consecutive weeks and was the most successful single in Germany in 2010. In March 2010 it was the second best-selling download in Germany with digital sales between 500,000 and 600,000. In France, it debuted at number four in December 2010 and reached number one. In Switzerland, it received Platinum status for 30,000 copies sold.

Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s version of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; has been used in commercials, films and television programs, including &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot;, &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;, &quot;Son of the Mask&quot;, and the television series &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The Kamakawiwoʻole version was sung by the cast of &quot;Glee&quot; on the season one finale &quot;Journey&quot; and included on &quot;,&quot; charting at number 30 in the UK, 31 in Canada and Ireland, 42 in Australia, and 43 in the U.S.

==Eva Cassidy version==
Eva Cassidy recorded a studio version of the song for &quot;The Other Side&quot; (1992). After her death in 1996, it was included on the posthumous compilation &quot;Songbird&quot; (1998). In December 2000, a clip of Cassidy performing the song at Blues Alley was featured on the BBC2 program &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;. Following the premiere, it became the program&#x27;s most-requested video in history, and demand for the album soared after the clip was re-aired in January 2001. The song was subsequently released as a single the same month, on January 29.

&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; debuted at number 88 on the UK Singles Chart in February 2001 and climbed to number 42 in May, becoming Cassidy&#x27;s first single to chart in the United Kingdom. In Scotland, it reached number 36, giving Cassidy her first top-40 single in that region. It was her highest-charting song in the United Kingdom until 2007, when &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; reached number one. The song also reached number 27 in Ireland in December, becoming her only top-40 hit in that country.

Cassidy&#x27;s recording was selected by the BBC for its &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; album in 1999. Her performance at Blues Alley appeared on the album &quot;Simply Eva&quot; (2011).

==Cliff Richard version==
On December 3, 2001, the British singer Cliff Richard recorded a cover of the mashup &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;/&quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; on his album &quot;Wanted&quot;. At the time of release the official website for the album explained that it consisted of &quot;hits Cliff&#x27;s always &#x27;Wanted&#x27; to record.&quot; The album is primarily made up of cover songs, including songs by artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Carole King and Tina Turner. The inspiration for the album came when Richard was sent a copy of Israel Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole&#x27;s recording of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; combined with &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; weeks into the year 2000 and he knew immediately he wanted to record it.

The mashup reggae-themed track with a lot of similarities to the Israel Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole arrangement was released as the debut single from the album &quot;Wanted&quot; and charted on the UK Singles Chart peaking at number 11 and stayed for 6 weeks in the British charts. Richard premiered it on the &quot;Open House with Gloria Hunniford&quot; on November 6, 2001. On the date of release of the single on December 3, 2001, he was invited to the ITV programme &quot;This Morning&quot; to perform it live. He also performed it at the Premier Christmas Spectacular at Methodist Westminster Central Hall in London on December 14, 2001.

==Danielle Hope version==
Danielle Hope, the winner of the BBC talent show &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, released a cover version of the song as a digital download on May 23, 2010, and a single on May 31, 2010. As it was recorded before a winner was announced, runners-up Lauren Samuels and Sophie Evans also recorded versions.

<text>Charles Carroll (22 March 1723 – 23 March 1783) was an American statesman from Annapolis, Maryland. He was the builder of the Baltimore Colonial home Mount Clare (1760), and a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1776 and 1777.

== Early life ==
A descendant of the last Gaelic Lords of Éile in Ireland, Charles Carroll was born in Annapolis, Maryland of a distinguished Roman Catholic family and was a distant cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737–1832), and Daniel Carroll (the First and Second), (1730–1796). His father, also Charles Carroll, took him to Europe in 1733 for his education. Young Charles spent six years at the English House school in Lisbon, Portugal. He then went to England to complete his education at Eton and Cambridge. After graduating Cambridge in 1746, Charles returned to Annapolis. He took up residence there. He busied himself learning to manage the family&#x27;s farm and mills at Carrollton.

In 1751 Charles decided on a more specific career. He journeyed to London, took up residence at the Middle Temple, and studied law. He was admitted to the bar at the Inns of Court there before returning to Maryland early in 1755. Since there were now three other relatives named Charles active in public affairs in the area, he began to call himself &quot;Charles Carroll, Barrister&quot;. However, he never practiced law in the US.

Three months later his father died, leaving Charles, at 32, one of the wealthiest men in Maryland. He was elected to his father&#x27;s seat for Anne Arundel County in the Maryland Assembly, legislature in Annapolis for the colony.

In 1760 he completed construction of his summer home and estate at &quot;Georgia Plantation&quot;, southwest of Baltimore along the Georgetown Road, also known as the Columbia Road (later Washington Boulevard, (U.S. Route 1) in modern Carroll Park and north of the Gwynns Falls stream which flows into the Middle Branch (&quot;Ridgeley&#x27;s Cove&quot;) and Ferry Branch of the Patapsco River. He named the home &quot;Mount Clare&quot; after his grandmother. In June 1763 Charles married, to Margaret Tilghman (1742–1817), daughter of Matthew Tilghman of Talbot County. Although the couple had no children who reached maturity, they remained together until his death. She became the mistress of Mount Clare, and earned a reputation for her greenhouse and pinery, where she grew oranges, lemons, and pineapple.

== Revolutionary years ==
Carroll continued in the Assembly until it was at the beginning of the Revolution, and then met with other leaders in the Annapolis Convention and had important roles in all their sessions. He joined the Committee of Correspondence in 1774, and the &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; in 1775. He presided over several sessions of the Convention, which was the early revolutionary government in Maryland.

Charles was one of the committee of the convention that drafted the &quot; &quot;Declaration and Charter of Rights and form of government for the state of Maryland&quot;&quot; which served as Maryland&#x27;s first new constitution after it was adopted on 3 November 1776. When the convention voted to expel the 23rd proprietary governor and last royal governor, Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, he delivered the message as the chairman of the Convention. Then, in an action typical of his style, he entertained the governor and his wife as house guests at Mount Clare Mansion until they sailed for England.

Later in November 1776, the Convention sent Carroll as a delegate to the Continental Congress to replace his cousin, Charles Carroll of Carrollton. He served in that Congress until 15 February 1777. He declined the position of Chief Justice in the new revolutionary confederation government. But when he returned, he was elected to the first state Senate in 1777. Later he was re-elected and served in that office until his death, on 23 March 1783, at Mount Clare Mansion. His funeral was held at Old St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church (now Episcopal since 1789) in Baltimore at North Charles and East Saratoga Streets. He was buried there (small cemetery surrounding original church, later moved to block between West Baltimore and Lombard Streets-bounded by new Martin Luther King Boulevard) but later his body was moved to St. Anne&#x27;s Churchyard (Anglican/Episcopal) off Church Circle in Annapolis.

== Mount Clare and other ==

In the early 1760s, Carroll took the lead and encouraged a group of his business associates to build a fund for a young saddler, Charles Willson Peale, so that he could go to Europe and study painting.

After Charles&#x27; death, his wife Margaret stayed at Mount Clare until her death there on 14 March 1817. Mansion and grounds had many uses and owners during the later 19th Century. Their home today is a museum, (both for its architecture, furniture and decorations plus history of the plantation and family) operated since 1917 by the National Society of the Colonial Dames in the State of Maryland, on behalf of the owner which is the City of Baltimore and its Department of Recreation and Parks. The core of the home is the refurbished main block. The wings, which had been lost over the years, were rebuilt in 1908. A great deal of the family furniture and possessions are preserved there. The home is a fine example of Georgian architecture, and stands on a rise in the center of Carroll Park in southwest Baltimore City, surrounded by the neighborhoods of &quot;Pigtown&quot;, (so named for being the site of butcher shops and meat packing plants to process pigs transported from the Midwest on the B&amp;O Railroad); the neighborhood was also known by its more recent &quot;gentrified&quot; name of Washington Village. Mount Clare Museum House is open to the public year-round.

<doc id="475246" wikidata="Q501210" url="?curid=475246" title="Scalpay, Inner Hebrides">
<text>Scalpay (; ) is an inhabited island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland which has a population of 4.

== Geology ==
The bedrock of Scalpay is largely the Neoproterozoic age sandstone and conglomerates of the Sithean Glac an Ime Member of the Applecross Formation and in the west, the Mullach nan Carn members of the Diabaig Formation, a unit of the Torridon Group, or informally the Torridonian sandstone.
Outcrops of hornfelsed basalt of the Palaeocene age Skye Lava Group and the Palaeogene age Scalpay granite are found in the south and west of Scalpay.
The Scalpay Sandstone and Pabay Shale formations found in the southeast of the island around Scalpay House are assigned to the Lias Group. The Staffin Shale and Staffin Bay formations are of late Jurassic age and found east of Rubha Aosail Sligneach at Caolas Scalpay.
Quaternary deposits are represented by peat in the north, present day marine deposits and raised marine deposits along the southwestern shore and a restricted area of glacial till in the interior.
==Geography==
Separated from the east coast of Skye by Loch na Cairidh, Scalpay rises to at Mullach na Càrn. It has an area of just under . The island had a population of ten usual residents in 2001 and of four in 2011.

Scalpay is privately owned and operates a red deer farm, shooting estate and holiday cottages. Much of Scalpay is covered with heather, while other areas are conifer forestry plantations.

==Etymology==
Mac an Tàilleir (2003) suggests the name derives from &quot;ship island&quot; from the Norse. However, Haswell-Smith states that the Old Norse name was &quot;Skalprøy&quot;, meaning &quot;scallop island&quot;.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
Between 1999 and 2004 a large scale archaeological project, Scotland&#x27;s First Settlers, was undertaken in the Inner Sound to locate and examine sites relating to the Mesolithic period in the strait. The entire coastline of the Inner Sound together with its islands was walked by volunteers and archaeologists. On Scalpay they found 9 lithic scatters. All of these sites were prehistoric but only three of the sites contained microliths, which confirms them as Mesolithic.

==History==

Dean Monro gave the following description of Scalpay in 1549:...a fair hunting forest, full of deer, with certain little woods and small towns, well inhabited and manured, with many strong coves, good for fishing, in heritage it pertains to Maclean of Duart.

By the time of Dr Johnson&#x27;s tour, the island was held by a tenant of Sir Alexander Macdonald.

Shipping magnate and politician Donald Currie owned the island in the late 19th century and was responsible for the construction of the first roads and much tree planting.

<doc id="475247" wikidata="Q2558705" url="?curid=475247" title="Sanday, Inner Hebrides">
<text>Sanday (; ) is one of the Small Isles, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. It is a tidal island linked to its larger neighbour, Canna, via sandbanks at low tide, and also connected to the larger island by a bridge. Canna and Sanday form a single community, and are usually described as Canna.
Like its neighbour, Canna, the whole island is owned by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), and is part of the Lochaber committee area of Highland Council.
Whereas Canna is run by the NTS as a single farm, parts of Sanday are used for crofting.

A small primary school on Sanday served the communities of both islands, although is currently closed. A footbridge to the island was built in 1905 to allow pupils from Canna to reach the school regardless of the state of the tide. This bridge was destroyed by storms in 2005, and has been replaced by a road bridge which was completed in April 2006. This new bridge allows vehicular access at all tide levels between the two islands, although parts of the road on Sanday were still covered by water during high tides until the completion of a new road in 2018.

From the mainland the island can be reached by the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry system from the port of Mallaig. Sanday includes rocks that are geologically part of the Paleocene and Eocene British Tertiary Volcanic Province, among some of the youngest rocks found in Scotland.

The largest and most conspicuous building on Sanday is the deconsecrated Catholic church of St Edward, which stands alone on an elevated part of the island, away from the cottages which, together with the school, cluster around the bay facing Canna.

The church, which is also owned by the National Trust for Scotland, was restored and converted into a hostel and Study Centre by the Hebridean Trust. This project was undertaken at the invitation of the owners. The centre is linked to the Archive of Gaelic language and culture that was created by the former owner of Canna and Sanday, John Lorne Campbell. It was successfully completed and opened in 2001 by the Princess Royal. Subsequently, there was water ingress, which caused damage to the interior. This challenge is in the hands of the National Trust for Scotland.
The island is home to a number of different types of wildlife, including puffins, great skua and Manx shearwater.

After John Napier discovered logarithms and Edmund Gunter created the logarithmic scales (lines, or rules) upon which slide rules are based, Oughtred was the first to use two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division. He is credited with inventing the slide rule in about 1622. He also introduced the &quot;×&quot; symbol for multiplication and the abbreviations &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;cos&quot; for the sine and cosine functions.

==Clerical life==
===Education===
The son of Benjamin Oughtred of Eton in Buckinghamshire (now part of Berkshire), William was born there on 5 March 1574/75 and was educated at Eton College, where his father, a writing-master, was one of his teachers. Oughtred had a passion for mathematics, and would often stay awake at nights to learn while others were sleeping. He then attended King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1596/97 and MA in 1600, holding a fellowship in the college from 1595 to 1603. He composed a Funeral Ode in Latin for Sir William More of Loseley Park in 1600.

===Rector at Guildford and at Shalford===

Admitted to holy orders, he left the University of Cambridge about 1603, when as &quot;Master&quot; William Oughtred he held the rectorate of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Guildford, Surrey. At the presentation of the lay patron George Austen, gent., he was instituted as vicar at Shalford near Wonersh, in the neighbourhood of Guildford in western Surrey, on 2 July 1605.

On 20 February 1606, at Shalford, Oughtred married Christs-gift Caryll, a relation of the Caryll family seated at Great Tangley Hall at Shalford. The Oughtreds had twelve children, William, Henry, Henry (the first Henry died as a baby), Benjamin, Simon, Margaret, Judith, Edward, Elizabeth, Anne, George, and John. Two of the sons, Benjamin and John, shared their father&#x27;s interest in instruments and became watchmakers.

Oughtred&#x27;s wife was a niece of Simon Caryll of Tangley and his wife Lady Elizabeth Aungier (married 1607), daughter of Sir Francis Aungier. Oughtred was a witness to Simon Caryll&#x27;s will, made 1618, and through two further marriages Elizabeth remained matriarch and dowager of Great Tangley until her death in about 1650. Elizabeth&#x27;s brother Gerald, 2nd Baron Aungier of Longford, was married to Jane, daughter of Sir Edward Onslow of Knowle, Surrey in 1638. Oughtred praised Gerald (whom he taught) as a man of great piety and learning, skilled in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and other oriental languages.

In January 1610 Sir George More, patron of Compton church adjacent to Loseley Park, granted the advowson (right of presentation of the minister) to Oughtred, when it should next fall vacant, though Oughtred was not thereby empowered to present himself to the living. This was soon after Sir George More became reconciled to the marriage of his daughter Anne to the poet John Donne, which had occurred secretly in 1601.

===Rector of Albury===
Oughtred was presented by Sir Edward Randyll of Chilworth (lord of the manor) to the rectory of Albury, near Guildford in Surrey and instituted on 16 October 1610, vacating Shalford on 18 January 1611. 

In January 1615/16 Sir George More re-granted the advowson of Compton church (still occupied) in trust to Roger Heath and Simon Caryll, to present Oughtred himself, or any other person whom Oughtred should nominate, when the vacancy should arise. Soon afterwards Oughtred was approached by John Tichborne seeking his own nomination, and entering an agreement to pay him a sum of money upon certain days. Before this could be completed the incumbent died (November 1618), and Oughtred sought for himself to be presented, preaching several times at Compton, having the first fruits sequestered to his use, and, after four months, asking the patron to present him. However, Tichborne offered to complete the agreed payment at once, and was accordingly presented by the trustees in May 1619 (Simon Caryll dying in that year): but before he could be admitted, the Crown interposed a different candidate because the contract between Oughtred and Tichborne was deemed by Sir Henry Yelverton clearly to be Simoniacal.
Oughtred therefore remained at Albury, serving as rector there for fifty years. His patron, the Earl of Arundel, acquired the fine old seat of Albury House through trustees in 1638: title to the manor was assigned in trust for payment of debts to George Duncombe (of Weston in Albury, embedded in the Carrill and Onslow interests), who maintained the manorial courts until his death in 1646, and then to Duncombe&#x27;s children. The Park and landscapes, which formed the subject of a series of etchings produced by Wenceslas Hollar, c. 1645, were developed in this period, before a parliamentary sequestration which was eventually discharged in 1653. The Earl having died in 1646, and his son and successor Henry (who renewed the assignment) in 1652, it was the grandson Henry Howard (later Duke of Norfolk) who finally paid for and acquired Albury.

William Lilly, that celebrated astrologer, knew Oughtred and claimed in his autobiography to have intervened on his behalf to prevent his ejection from his living by Parliament in 1646:&quot;About this time, the most famous mathematician of all Europe, Mr. William Oughtred, parson of Aldbury in Surry, was in danger of sequestration by the Committee of or for plundered ministers; ( they were;) several inconsiderable articles were deposed and sworn against him, material enough to have sequestered him, but that, upon his day of hearing, I applied myself to Sir Bolstrode Whitlock, and all my own old friends, who in such numbers appeared in his behalf, that though the chairman and many other Presbyterian members were stiff against him, yet he was cleared by the major number.&quot; Of his portrait (aged 73, 1646) engraved by Wenceslas Hollar, prefixed to the &quot;Clavis Mathematica&quot;, John Evelyn remarked that it &quot;extreamly resembles him&quot;, and that it showed &quot;that calm and placid Composure, which seemed to proceed from, and be the result of some happy &quot;ἕυρησις&quot; and Invention&quot;. William Oughtred died at Albury in 1660, a month after the restoration of Charles II. A staunch supporter of the royalty, he is said to have died of joy at the knowledge of the return of the King. He was buried in Old St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Albury. Autobiographical information is contained in his address &quot;To the English gentrie&quot; in his &quot;Just Apologie&quot; of c. 1634.

==Mathematician==
Oughtred developed his interest in mathematics early in life, and devoted whatever spare time his academic studies allowed him to it. Among the short tracts added to the 1647/48 editions of the &quot;Clavis Mathematica&quot; was one describing a natural and easy way of delineating sun-dials upon any surface, however positioned, which the author states he invented in his 23rd year (1597/98), which is to say, during his fellowship at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His early preoccupation was to find a portable instrument or dial by which to find the hour, he tried various contrivances, but never to his satisfaction. &quot;At last, considering that all manner of questions concerning the first motions were performed most properly by the Globe itself, rectified to the present elevation by the help of a moveable Azimuth; he projected the Globe upon the plane of the Horizon, and applied to it at the center, which was therein the Zenith, an Index with projected degrees, for the moveable Azimuth.&quot; 
This projection answered his search, but then he had to invent theorems, problems and methods to calculate sections and intersections of large circles, which he could not find by instruments, not having access to any of sufficient size. In this way he drew out his findings, presenting one example to Bishop Thomas Bilson (who had ordained him), and another, in about 1606, to a certain noble lady, for whom he wrote notes for its use. In London, in spring 1618, Oughtred visited his friend Henry Briggs at Gresham College, and was introduced to Edmund Gunter, Reader in Astronomy, then occupying Dr Brooks&#x27;s rooms. He showed Gunter his &quot;Horizontall Instrument&quot;, who questioned him closely about it and spoke very approvingly. Soon afterwards Gunter sent him a print taken from a brass instrument made by Elias Allen, after Oughtred&#x27;s written instructions (which Allen preserved). When, in 1632, Richard Delamain the elder claimed that invention for himself, William Robinson wrote to Oughtred: &quot;I cannot but wonder at the indiscretion of Rich. Delamain, who being conscious to himself that he is but the pickpurse of another man&#x27;s wit, would thus inconsiderately provoke and awake a sleeping lion...&quot;

Around 1628 he was appointed by the Earl of Arundel to instruct his son William Howard in mathematics. Some of Oughtred&#x27;s mathematical correspondence survives, and is printed in Bayle&#x27;s &quot;General Dictionary&quot;, and (with some editorial omissions restored) in Dr Rigaud&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence of Scientific Men&quot;. William Alabaster wrote to him in 1633 to propose the quadrature of the circle by consideration of the fourth chapter of the Book of Ezekiel. In 1634 he corresponded with the French architect François Derand, and (among others) with Sir Charles Cavendish (1635), Johannes Banfi Hunyades (1637), William Gascoigne (1640) and Dr John Twysden, M.D. (1650). 

Oughtred offered free mathematical tuition to pupils, among them Richard Delamain and Jonas Moore, and his teaching influenced a generation of mathematicians. Seth Ward resided with Oughtred for six months to learn contemporary mathematics, and the physician Charles Scarborough also stayed at Albury: John Wallis and Christopher Wren corresponded with him. Another Albury pupil was Robert Wood, who helped him to see the &quot;Clavis&quot; through the press. Isaac Newton&#x27;s high opinion of Oughtred is expressed in his letter of 1694 to Nathaniel Hawes, where he quotes him extensively, calling him &quot;a Man whose judgement (if any man&#x27;s) may safely be relyed upon... that very good and judicious man, Mr Oughtred&quot;.

The first edition of John Wallis&#x27;s foundational text on infinitesimal calculus, &quot;Arithmetica Infinitorum&quot; (1656), carries a long letter of dedication to William Oughtred.

==Publications==

===&quot;Clavis Mathematicæ&quot; (1631)===

William Oughtred&#x27;s most important work was first published in 1631, in Latin, under the title &quot;Arithemeticæ in Numeris et Speciebus Institutio, quae tum Logisticæ, tum Analyticæ, atque adeus totius Mathematicæ quasi Clavis est&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Foundation of Arithmetic in Numbers and Kinds, which is as it were the Key of the Logistic, then of the Analytic, and so of the whole Mathematic(s)&quot;). It was dedicated to William Howard, youngest son of Oughtred&#x27;s patron Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel. 
This is a textbook on elementary algebra. It begins with a discussion of the Hindu-Arabic notation of decimal fractions and later introduces multiplication and division sign abbreviations of decimal fractions. Oughtred also discussed two ways to perform long division and introduced the &quot;~&quot; symbol, in terms of mathematics, expressing the difference between two variables. &quot;Clavis Mathematicae&quot; became a classic, reprinted in several editions. It was used as a textbook by John Wallis and Isaac Newton among others. A concise work, it argued for a less verbose style in mathematics, and greater dependence on symbols. Drawing on François Viète (though not explicitly), Oughtred also innovated freely with symbols, introducing not only the multiplication sign as now used universally, but also the proportion sign (double colon ::). The first edition, 1631, contained 20 chapters and 88 pages including algebra and various fundamentals of mathematics. 

The work was recast for the &quot;New&quot; Key, which appeared first in an English edition of 1647, &quot;The Key of the Mathematicks New Forged and Filed&quot;, dedicated to Sir Richard Onslow and to his son Arthur Onslow (son and grandson of Sir Edward), and then in a Latin edition of 1648, entitled &quot;Clavis Mathematica Denuo Limata, sive potius Fabricata&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Mathematical Key Newly Filed, or rather Made&quot;), in which the preface was removed and the book was reduced by one chapter. In the English Foreword, Oughtred explains that the intention had always been to provide the ingenious reader with an &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s thread&quot; through the intricate labyrinth of these studies, but that his earlier, highly compressed style had been found difficult by some, and was now further elucidated. These editions contained additional tracts on the resolution of adfected equations proposed in numbers, and other materials necessary for the use of decimal parts and logarithms, as well as his work on delineating sundials.

The last lifetime edition (third) was in 1652, and posthumous editions (as &quot;Clavis Mathematicæ&quot;: i.e. &quot;The Key of Mathematic(s)&quot;) appeared in 1667 and 1693 (Latin), and in 1694 (English). The work gained popularity around 15 years after it first appeared, as mathematics took a greater role in higher education. Wallis wrote the introduction to his 1652 edition, and used it to publicise his skill as cryptographer; in another, Oughtred promoted the talents of Wren.

===&quot;The Circles of Proportion and the Horizontal Instrument&quot; (1632)===
This work was used by Oughtred in manuscript before it was edited for publication by his pupil, William Forster. Here Oughtred introduced the abbreviations for trigonometric functions. It contains his description and instructions for the use of his important invention, the slide rule, a mechanical means of finding logarithmic results.

Two of Oughtred&#x27;s students, William Forster and Richard Delamaine the elder, are concerned with the story of this book. As instructor to the Earl of Arundel&#x27;s son, Oughtred had the use of a room in Arundel House, the Earl&#x27;s residence in the Strand, in London. He gave free instruction there to Richard Delamaine, whom he found to be too dependent on mathematical instruments to get a proper grasp of the theory behind them. Another student of his, Forster, who came to him as a beginner during the 1620s, was therefore taught without reference to instruments so that he should have a true grounding. However, during the long vacation of 1630 Forster (who taught mathematics from a house in St Clement Danes churchyard, on the Westminster side of Temple Bar, in the same locality as Elias Allen&#x27;s shop), while staying with Oughtred at Albury, asked him about Gunter&#x27;s Ruler, and was shown two instruments used by his master, including Oughtred&#x27;s circular slide rule.
Oughtred then said to Forster:&quot;... the true way of Art is not by Instruments, but by Demonstration: and ... it is a preposterous course of vulgar Teachers, to begin with Instruments, and not with the Sciences, and so in-stead of Artists, to make their Schollers only doers of tricks, and as it were Iuglers: to the despite of Art, losse of precious time, and betraying of willing and industrious wits, unto ignorance, and idlenesse. ... the use of Instruments is indeed excellent, if a man be an Artist: but contemptible, being set and opposed to Art. And lastly, ... he meant to commend to me, the skill of Instruments, but first he would have me well instructed in the Sciences.&quot;

Forster obtained Oughtred&#x27;s permission to translate, edit and publish the description, explanations and instructions which Oughtred had in manuscript, finishing his work in 1632. Meanwhile Delamaine, who had also been shown the instruments, and had copied a text sent by Oughtred to his instrument-maker Elias Allen, was writing-up his own description and account. Delamaine came off the press first, in two separate tracts, claiming himself to be the inventor, and dedicating the prior treatise to King Charles I. He went so far as to show his page-proofs to Oughtred as they were being prepared, and dismissed his objections, printing some derogatory comments aimed at Forster and Oughtred in his Foreword. Forster, who dedicated &quot;The Circles of Proportion&quot; to the famous intellectual Sir Kenelm Digby, observed that another person had hastily anticipated Oughtred&#x27;s publication. It was left to Oughtred himself to publish his &quot;Just Apologie&quot; explaining the priority of his inventions and writings, and showing the behaviour of Delamaine. 

It is stated in Cajori&#x27;s book that John Napier was the first person to use to the decimal point and comma, but Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was really the first to do so.

===&quot;Trigonometria&quot;, with &quot;Canones Sinuum&quot; (1657)===
&quot;Trigonometria, Hoc est, Modus Computandi Triangulorum Latera &amp; Angulos&quot; was a collection compiled from Oughtred&#x27;s papers by Richard Stokes and Arthur Haughton. It contains about 36 pages of writing. Here the abbreviations for the trigonometric functions are explained in further detail consisting of mathematical tables. It carries a frontispiece portrait of Oughtred similar to that by Wenceslas Hollar, but re-engraved by William Faithorne, and depicted as aged 83, and with a short epigram by &quot;R.S.&quot; beneath. Longer verses addressed to Oughtred are prefixed by Christopher Wase.

===&quot;Opuscula Mathematica&quot; (1677)===
A miscellaneous collection of his hitherto unpublished mathematical papers (in Latin) was edited and published by his friend Sir Charles Scarborough in 1677. The treatises contained are on these subjects:

* Institutiones Mechanicæ.
* De variis corporum generibus gravitate et magnitudine comparatis.
* Automata
* Quæstiones Diophanti Alexandrini Lib. 3
* De Triangulis planis rectangulis
* De Divisione Superficierum
* Musicæ Elementa
* De Propugnaculorum Munitionibus
* Sectiones Angulares

==Inventions==
===Slide rule===
Oughtred&#x27;s invention of the slide rule consisted of taking a single &quot;rule&quot;, already known to Gunter, and simplifying the method of employing it. Gunter required the use of a pair of dividers to lay off distances on his rule; Oughtred made the step of sliding two rules past each other to achieve the same ends. His original design of some time in the 1620s was for a circular slide rule; but he was not the first into print with this idea, which was published by Delamain in 1630. The conventional design of a sliding middle section for a linear rule was an invention of the 1650s.

===Double horizontal sun dial===
At the age of 23, Oughtred invented the double horizontal sundial, now named the Oughtred type after him. A short description &quot;The description and use of the double Horizontall Dyall&quot; (16 pp.) was added to a 1653 edition (in English translation) of the pioneer book on recreational mathematics, &quot;Récréations Mathématiques&quot; (1624) by Hendrik van Etten, a pseudonym of Jean Leurechon. The translation itself is no longer attributed to Oughtred, but (probably) to Francis Malthus.

===Universal equinoctial ring dial===
Oughtred also invented the Universal equinoctial ring dial.

==Occult interests==
According to his contemporaries, Oughtred had interests in alchemy and astrology. The Hermetic science remained a philosophical touchstone among many reputable scientists of his time, and his student Thomas Henshaw copied a Diary and &quot;Practike&quot; given to him by his teacher. He was well-acquainted with the astrologer William Lilly who, as noted above, helped to prevent his ejection from his living in 1646.

===John Aubrey: Astrology and Geomancy===
John Aubrey states that (despite their political differences) Sir Richard Onslow, son of Sir Edward, also defended Oughtred against ejection in 1646. He adds that Oughtred was an astrologer, and successful in the use of natal astrology, and used to say that he did not know why it should be effective, but believed that some &quot;genius&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; assisted. According to Aubrey, Elias Ashmole possessed the original copy in Oughtred&#x27;s handwriting of his rational division of the twelve houses of the zodiac. Oughtred penned an approving testimonial, dated 16 October 1659, to the foot of the English abstract of &quot;The Cabal of the Twelve Houses Astrological&quot; by &quot;Morinus&quot; (Jean-Baptiste Morin) which George Wharton inserted in his Almanac for 1659.
Aubrey suggests that Oughtred was happy to allow the country people to believe that he was capable of conjuring. Aubrey himself had seen a copy of Christopher Cattan&#x27;s work on Geomancy annotated by Oughtred. He reported that Oughtred had told Bishop Ward and Elias Ashmole that he had received sudden intuitions or solutions to problems when standing in particular places, or leaning against a particular oak or ash tree, &quot;as if infused by a divine genius&quot;, after having pondered those problems unsuccessfully for months or years.

===Elias Ashmole: Freemasonry===
Oughtred was well-known to Elias Ashmole, as Ashmole stated in a note to Lilly&#x27;s autobiographical sketch: &quot;This gentleman I was very well acquainted with, having lived at the house over-against his, at Aldbury in Surrey, three or four years. E.A.&quot; 

The biography of Ashmole in the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot; (1747) called forth the supposition that Oughtred was a participant in Ashmole&#x27;s admission to freemasonry in 1646. Friedrich Nicolai, in both sections of his Essay (on the Templar and Masonic Orders) of 1783, associated Oughtred, Lilly, Wharton and other Astrologers in the formation of the order of Free and Accepted Masons in Warrington and London. The statement was reinforced through repetition by Thomas De Quincey, and elaborated by Jean-Marie Ragon, but was debunked in A.G. Mackey&#x27;s &quot;History of Freemasonry&quot; (1906). 

Ashmole noted that he paid a visit to &quot;Mr. Oughtred, the famous mathematician&quot;, on 15 September 1654, about three weeks after the Astrologers&#x27; Feast of that year.

===John Evelyn: Millenarianism===
Oughtred expressed millenarian views to John Evelyn in 1655:&quot;Came that renowned mathematician, Mr. Oughtred, to see me, I sending my coach to bring him to Wotton, being now very aged. Among other discourse, he told me he thought water to be the philosopher&#x27;s first matter, and that he was well persuaded of the possibility of their elixir; he believed the sun to be a material fire, the moon a continent, as appears by the late selenographers; he had strong apprehensions of some significant event to happen the following year, from the calculation of difference with the diluvian period; and added that it might possibly be to convert the Jews by our Saviour&#x27;s visible appearance, or to judge the world; and therefore, his word was, &quot;Parate in occursum&quot;; he said Original Sin was not met with in the Greek Fathers, yet he believed the thing; this was from some discourse on Dr. Taylor&#x27;s late book, which I had lent him.&quot;

==Oughtred Society==
Oughtred&#x27;s name is remembered in the Oughtred Society, a group formed in the United States in 1991 for collectors of slide rules. It produces the twice-yearly &quot;Journal of the Oughtred Society&quot; and holds meetings and auctions for its members.

<text>A mark of distinction, in heraldry, is a charge showing that the bearer of a shield is not (as defined by the rules or laws of heraldry in most, though not all, countries and situations) descended by blood from the original bearer. The &quot;mark of distinction&quot; (which is so called as it is supposed to &quot;make distinct&quot; that the bearer is not one of the possible legitimate heirs or heiresses) usually refers to a context of illegitimacy, the illegitimate offspring being regarded as a &quot;stranger in blood&quot; to his natural father. The mark of distinction may also be applied upon the adoption of a surname and arms of a family from whom the bearer is not descended.

<doc id="475254" wikidata="Q333534" url="?curid=475254" title="Petrus Plancius">
<text>Petrus Plancius (; born Pieter Platevoet ; 1552 – 15 May 1622) was a Dutch-Flemish astronomer, cartographer and clergyman. Born, in Dranouter, now in Heuvelland, West Flanders, he studied theology in Germany and England. At the age of 24 he became a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.

Plancius fled from Brussels to Amsterdam to avoid religious persecution by the Inquisition after the city fell into Spanish hands in 1585. In Amsterdam he became interested in navigation and cartography and, having access to nautical charts recently brought from Portugal, he was soon recognized as an expert on safe maritime routes to India and the nearby &quot;spice islands&quot;. This enabled colonies and port trade in both, including what would become the Dutch East Indies, named after the Dutch East India Company set up in 1602. He saw strong potential in the little-mapped Arctic Sea and strongly believed in the idea of a Northeast Passage until the failure of Willem Barentsz&#x27;s third voyage in 1597 seemed to preclude its viability.

==Cartography==

In 1592 Plancius published his best known world map, titled &quot;Nova et exacta Terrarum Orbis Tabula geographica ac hydrographica&quot;. Only one remaining copy is known to exist, preserved at the Colegio del Corpus Christi in Valencia, Spain. This copy is not easily accessible to visitors. Plancius also published journals and navigational guides and developed a new method for determining longitude. He also promoted the Mercator projection for navigational maps. Plancius was an investor in the Dutch East India Company, for which he drew over 100 maps.

Plancius was closely acquainted with Henry Hudson, an explorer of the New World.

Plancius prepared the map, &quot;Exacta &amp; accurata delinatio… regionibus China, Cauchinchina, Camboja, sive Champa, Syao, Malacca, Arracan &amp; Pegu,&quot; published in Jan Huygen van Linschoten&#x27;s popular book, &quot;Itinerario&quot; (1596).

===Uranography===
In 1589 Plancius collaborated with the Amsterdam cartographer Jacob van Langren on a 32.5-cm celestial globe, which, using the sparse information available about southern celestial features, depicted Crux (the southern cross), Triangulum Australe (the southern triangle), and the Magellanic Clouds (Nubecula Major and Minor).

In 1595 Plancius trained Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser, the chief pilot on the &quot;Hollandia&quot;, to make astronomical observations to fill in the blank area around the south celestial pole on European maps of the southern sky. Keyser died in Java the following year – the expedition had many casualties – but his catalogue of 135 stars, probably developed with the help of Keyser&#x27;s colleague Frederick de Houtman, was delivered to Plancius when the remaining ships returned. These stars appear as 12 new southern constellations, on a 35-cm celestial globe designed by Plancius in late 1597 (or early 1598) and produced in collaboration with the Amsterdam cartographer Jodocus Hondius the Elder. The 12 new constellations (mostly referring to animals and subjects described in natural history books and travellers&#x27; journals of his day) are Apis the Bee (later changed to Musca by Lacaille), Apus the Bird of Paradise, Chamaeleon, Dorado the Goldfish (or Swordfish), Grus the Crane, Hydrus the Small Water Snake, Indus the Indian, Pavo the Peacock, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe the Southern Triangle, Tucana the Toucan, and Volans the Flying Fish. (The Southern Triangle and Southern Cross were reported as asterisms by earlier navigators and appear on earlier charts, but the globe of 1598 is the first surviving source that plots their locations reasonably accurately.) Also notable is the inclusion of Achernar as Alpha Eridani. 

These constellations, together with the constellation Columba illustrated by Plancius on his large wall map of the world of 1592, were then incorporated in 1603 by Johann Bayer in his sky atlas, the &quot;Uranometria&quot;.

In 1612 (or 1613) Plancius introduced the following eight constellations on a 26.5-cm celestial globe published in Amsterdam by Pieter van der Keere: Apes the Bee, Camelopardalis the Giraffe (often interpreted as a Camel), Cancer Minor the Small Crab, Euphrates Fluvius et Tigris Fluvius the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, Gallus the Cock, Jordanis Fluvius the River Jordan, Monoceros the Unicorn and Sagitta Australis the Southern Arrow. Of the latter constellations, only Camelopardalis and Monoceros are still found on modern star charts, and recognized by the IAU.

The minor planet 10648 Plancius commemorates his contributions in celestial and terrestrial cartography.

<text>Logistics automation is the application of computer software or automated machinery to logistics operations in order to improve its efficiency. Typically this refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center, with broader tasks undertaken by supply chain engineering systems and enterprise resource planning systems.

Logistics automation systems can powerfully complement the facilities provided by these higher level computer systems. The focus on an individual node within a wider logistics network allows systems to be highly tailored to the requirements of that node.

==Components==


Logistics automation systems comprise a variety of hardware and software components:

* Fixed machinery
** Automated storage and retrieval systems, including:
*** Cranes serve a rack of locations, allowing many levels of stock to be stacked vertically, and allowing for higher storage densities and better space utilization than alternatives.
*** In systems produced by Amazon Robotics, automated guided vehicles move items to a human picker.
** Conveyors: Containers can enter automated conveyors in one area of the warehouse and, either through hard-coded rules or data input, be moved to a selected destination.
*** Vertical carousels based on the paternoster lift system or using space optimization, similar to vending machines, but on a larger scale.
** Sortation systems: similar to conveyors but typically with higher capacity and able to divert containers more quickly. Typically used to distribute high volumes of small cartons to a large set of locations.
** Industrial robots: four- to six-axis industrial robots, e.g. palletizing robots, are used for palletizing, depalletizing, packaging, commissioning and order picking.
** Typically all of these will automatically identify and track containers using barcodes or, increasingly, RFID tags.
* Motion check weighers may be used to reject cases or individual products that are under or over their specified weight. They are often used in kitting conveyor lines to ensure all pieces belonging in the kit are present.
*Mobile technology
**Radio data terminals: these are handheld or truck-mounted terminals which connect by radio to logistics automation software and provide instructions to operators moving throughout the warehouse. Many also have barcode scanners to allow identification of containers more quickly and accurately than manual keyboard entry.
* Software
** Integration software: this provides overall control of the automation machinery and allows cranes to be connected to conveyors for seamless stock movements.
** Operational control software: provides low-level decision-making, such as where to store incoming containers, and where to retrieve them when requested.
** Business control software: provides higher-level functionality, such as identification of incoming deliveries/stock, scheduling order fulfillment, and assignment of stock to outgoing trailers.

==Benefits of logistics automation==
A typical warehouse or distribution center will receive stock of a variety of products from suppliers and store these until the receipt of orders from customers, whether individual buyers (e.g. mail order), retail branches (e.g. chain stores), or other companies (e.g. wholesalers). A logistics automation system may provide the following:

* Automated goods in processes: Incoming goods can be marked with barcodes and the automation system notified of the expected stock. On arrival, the goods can be scanned and thereby identified, and taken via conveyors, sortation systems, and automated cranes into an automatically assigned storage location.
* Automated Goods Retrieval for Orders: On receipt of orders, the automation system is able to immediately locate goods and retrieve them to a pick-face location.
* Automated processing: Combining knowledge of all orders placed at the warehouse the automation system can assign picked goods into dispatch units and then into outbound loads. Sortation systems and conveyors can then move these onto the outgoing trailers.
* If needed, repackaging to ensure proper protection for further distribution or to change the package format for specific retailers/customers.

A complete warehouse automation system can drastically reduce the workforce required to run a facility, with human input required only for a few tasks, such as picking units of product from a bulk packed case. Even here, assistance can be provided with equipment such as pick-to-light units. Smaller systems may only be required to handle part of the process. Examples include automated storage and retrieval systems, which simply use cranes to store and retrieve identified cases or pallets, typically into a high-bay storage system which would be unfeasible to access using fork-lift trucks or any other means. The use of Automatic Guided Vehicles maximizes the output compared to humans since they can do repetitive tasks for long hours and with least to no supervision. An AGV is built and programmed for precision and accuracy thereby reducing the chances of errors in a warehouse, especially when dealing with fragile goods.

==Automation software==
Software or cloud-based SaaS solutions are used for logistics automation which helps the supply chain industry in automating the workflow as well as management of the system. Knowledge @ Wharton staff writers noted in 2011 that some manufacturers and retailers were weathering the Great Recession &quot;by signing up for pay-as-you-go logistics services available through the Internet &#x27;cloud&#x27;&quot;. They identified the benefits and reduced costs which came from sharing information about shipments with suppliers, hauliers and end users.

There is little generalized software available in this market. This is because there is no rule to generalize the system as well as work flow even though the practice is more or less the same. Most of the commercial companies do use one or the other of the custom solutions.

But there are various software solutions that are being used within the departments of logistics. There are a few departments in Logistics, namely: Conventional Department, Container Department, Warehouse, Marine Engineering, Heavy Haulage, etc.

;Software used in these departments

* Conventional department : CVT software / CTMS software.
* Container Trucking: CTMS software
* Warehouse : WMS/WCS

<text>Stephanie Anne Birkitt (born January 7, 1975) is an American attorney and former assistant to David Letterman on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Although Birkitt frequently appeared on the program as a character named &quot;Vicki&quot;, Letterman often called her by various other nicknames, such as &quot;Smitty&quot;, &quot;Kitty&quot;, &quot;Monty&quot;, &quot;Gunther&quot;, and &quot;Dutch&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Birkitt was born in Plymouth, New Hampshire. Her mother is an assistant principal and her father is a dentist. She graduated from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1997, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and a minor in communications.

She graduated from Yeshiva University&#x27;s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in June 2008 with a juris doctor. In February 2009, Birkitt passed the New York State and Connecticut bar examinations. Birkitt has been a licensed attorney in California since 2011. She also has had an active Connecticut lawyer license since 2009.

== &quot;Late Show&quot; career ==
Birkitt&#x27;s career at CBS started before she graduated from college, when she worked as an intern for CBS News, &quot;48 Hours&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show&quot; in early 1996. After graduation she became a member of the CBS page program and worked briefly as an associate producer at &quot;48 Hours&quot; on segments for correspondent Erin Moriarty. Deciding she was not &quot;much of a news hound&quot;, she applied for a job as an office worker for David Letterman, helping to handle his charities and his Indy car racing team.

Her spring internship led to Birkitt&#x27;s first appearance on the &quot;Late Show&quot;, on May 24, 1996. Her next appearance was over four years later, on December 26, 2000, when Letterman called her in her office during the show. After that appearance, Letterman began to call her regularly as an on-air feature of the show, beginning in January 2001. Birkitt said, &quot;He started talking to me more, and we developed a rapport.&quot;

By 2002, Birkitt began to be featured on the &quot;Late Show&quot; as a character outside of her role as Letterman&#x27;s assistant. She appeared during the &quot;CBS Mailbag&quot; segment numerous times, sometimes donning costumes that related to a specific ongoing festival or event. She interviewed &quot;Survivor&quot; castoffs, asking them &quot;Did you see or touch any monkeys?&quot;, much to Letterman&#x27;s feigned displeasure. In 2002, she was named No. 21 in &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Pop Candy&#x27;s 100 People of the Year!&quot; list. As herself, she gave on-air reports from the sites of the Winter Olympics in 2002 and 2006. In all, she made more than 250 appearances on the program between 1996 and 2008. By the time of her final appearances on the show, in late 2008, she had completed her law school education.

In addition to her appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Birkitt co-hosted &quot;The Tony Mendez Show&quot;, a spin-off program with Tony Mendez (also known as &quot;The Cue Card Boy&quot;) that was hosted on the &quot;Late Show&quot; website.

Birkitt described her relationship with Letterman in an interview with the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; in 2004. In the article, titled &quot;Letterman Aide is Dave&#x27;s Main Tease&quot;, Birkitt said, &quot;[Letterman is] just playful. We play catch sometimes in the office, and we all go to screenings together. We eat food together, we sit around and watch TV together and goof on people. And he teases me in real life, too, but I give it back a lot more in real life.&quot;

In a statement released on October 7, 2009, Letterman&#x27;s production company, Worldwide Pants, announced that Birkitt had been placed on a &quot;paid leave of absence&quot; from the &quot;Late Show&quot;.

==Affair with Letterman==
On October 1, 2009, Letterman announced on air that he had been the victim of an extortion attempt in which an alleged blackmailer—since identified by police as CBS television producer Joe Halderman—threatened to reveal that Letterman had engaged in sexual affairs with multiple female employees. Letterman admitted on television that the allegation was true, but did not reveal the names of, or any identifying information about, the female employees. Soon afterward, the extortionist was identified by media as a former lover of Birkitt, and anonymous sources alleged that Birkitt and Letterman also had a sexual relationship.

Birkitt reportedly was neither aware of nor involved in the blackmail attempt. According to CBS News, she and Halderman lived together in Halderman&#x27;s home in Norwalk, Connecticut, until August 2009, when she reportedly moved out; she was also romantically linked to Letterman during the same time. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on October 6 that Birkitt had an affair with Letterman, which continued during her relationship with Halderman. Copies of entries in Birkitt&#x27;s diary, as well as emails between her and Letterman, were reportedly the basis of the blackmail evidence Halderman allegedly placed in Letterman&#x27;s car. Halderman was sentenced to six months in prison for the attempted extortion.

<doc id="475276" wikidata="Q568491" url="?curid=475276" title="Downforce">
<text>Downforce is a downwards lift force created by the aerodynamic features of a vehicle. If the vehicle is a car, the purpose of downforce is to allow the car to travel faster by increasing the vertical force on the tires, thus creating more grip. If the vehicle is a fixed-wing aircraft, the purpose of the downforce on the horizontal stabilizer is to maintain longitudinal stability and allow the pilot to control the aircraft in pitch.

==Fundamental principles==
The same principle that allows an airplane to rise off the ground by creating lift from its wings is used in reverse to apply force that presses the race car against the surface of the track. This effect is referred to as &quot;aerodynamic grip&quot; and is distinguished from &quot;mechanical grip&quot;, which is a function of the car&#x27;s mass, tires, and suspension. The creation of downforce by passive devices can be achieved only at the cost of increased aerodynamic drag (or friction), and the optimum setup is almost always a compromise between the two.

The aerodynamic setup for a car can vary considerably between race tracks, depending on the length of the straights and the types of corners. Because it is a function of the flow of air over and under the car, downforce increases with the square of the car&#x27;s speed and requires a certain minimum speed in order to produce a significant effect. Some cars have had rather unstable aerodynamics, such that a minor change in angle of attack or height of the vehicle can cause large changes in downforce. In the very worst cases this can cause the car to experience lift, not downforce; for example, by passing over a bump on a track or slipstreaming over a crest: this could have some disastrous consequences, such as Mark Webber&#x27;s and Peter Dumbreck&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz CLR in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, which flipped spectacularly after closely following a competitor car over a hump.

Two primary components of a racing car can be used to create downforce when the car is travelling at racing speed:

* the shape of the body, and
* the use of airfoils.

Most racing formulae have a ban on aerodynamic devices that can be adjusted during a race, except during pit stops.

The downforce exerted by a wing is usually expressed as a function of its lift coefficient:

:formula_1

where:
*&quot;F&quot; is downforce (SI unit: newtons)
*&quot;CL&quot; is the lift coefficient
*&quot;ρ&quot; is air density (SI unit: kg/m3)
*&quot;v&quot; is velocity (SI unit: m/s)
*&quot;A&quot; is the area of the wing (SI unit: meters squared), which depends on its wingspan and chord if using top wing area basis for &quot;CL&quot;, or the wingspan and thickness of the wing if using frontal area basis

In certain ranges of operating conditions and when the wing is not stalled, the lift coefficient has a constant value: the downforce is then proportional to the square of airspeed.

In aerodynamics, it is usual to use the top-view projected area of the wing as a reference surface to define the lift coefficient.

==Body==
The rounded and tapered shape of the top of a car is designed to slice through the air and minimize wind resistance. Detailed pieces of bodywork on top of the car can be added to allow a smooth flow of air to reach the downforce-creating elements (e.g., wings or spoilers, and underbody tunnels).

The overall shape of a car resembles an airplane wing. Almost all road cars produce aerodynamic lift as a result of this shape. There are many techniques that are used to counterbalance this lift. Looking at the profile of most road cars, the front bumper has the lowest ground clearance followed by the section between the front and rear tires, and followed by a rear bumper, usually with the highest clearance. Using this layout, the air flowing under the front bumper will be constricted to a lower cross-sectional area, and thus achieve a lower pressure. Additional downforce comes from the rake (or angle) of the vehicle&#x27;s body, which directs the underside air up and creates a downward force, increasing the pressure on top of the car because the airflow direction comes closer to perpendicular to the surface. 

Volume does not affect the air pressure because it is not an enclosed volume, despite the common misconception. Race cars amplify this effect by adding a rear diffuser to accelerate air under the car in front of the diffuser, and raise the air pressure behind it, lessening the car&#x27;s wake. Other aerodynamic components that can be found on the underside to improve downforce and/or reduce drag, include splitters and vortex generators.

Some cars, such as the DeltaWing, do not have wings, and generate all of their downforce through their body.

==Airfoils==
The magnitude of the downforce created by the wings or spoilers on a car is dependent primarily on three things:
* The shape, including surface area, aspect ratio and cross-section of the device,
* The device&#x27;s orientation (or angle of attack), and
* The speed of the vehicle.

A larger surface area creates greater downforce and greater drag. The aspect ratio is the width of the airfoil divided by its chord. If the wing is not rectangular, aspect ratio is written AR=b2/s, where AR=aspect ratio, b=span, and s=wing area. Also, a greater angle of attack (or tilt) of the wing or spoiler, creates more downforce, which puts more pressure on the rear wheels and creates more drag.

===Front===
The function of the airfoils at the front of the car is twofold. They create downforce that enhances the grip of the front tires, while also optimizing (or minimizing disturbance to) the flow of air to the rest of the car. The front wings on an open-wheeled car undergo constant modification as data is gathered from race to race, and are customized for every characteristic of a particular circuit (see top photos). In most series, the wings are even designed for adjustment during the race itself when the car is serviced.

===Rear===
The flow of air at the rear of the car is affected by the front wings, front wheels, mirrors, driver&#x27;s helmet, side pods and exhaust. This causes the rear wing to be less aerodynamically efficient than the front wing, Yet, because it must generate more than twice as much downforce as the front wings in order to maintain the handling to balance the car, the rear wing typically has a much larger aspect ratio, and often uses two or more elements to compound the amount of downforce created (see photo at left). Like the front wings, each of these elements can often be adjusted when the car is serviced, before or even during a race, and are the object of constant attention and modification.

===Wings in unusual places===
Partly as a consequence of rules aimed at reducing downforce from the front and rear wings of F1 cars, several teams have sought to find other places to position wings. Small wings mounted on the rear of the cars&#x27; sidepods began to appear in mid-1994, and were virtually standard on all F1 cars in one form or another, until all such devices were outlawed in 2009. Other wings have sprung up in various other places about the car, but these modifications are usually only used at circuits where downforce is most sought, particularly the twisty Hungary and Monaco racetracks.

The 1995 McLaren Mercedes MP4/10 was one of the first cars to feature a &quot;midwing&quot;, using a loophole in the regulations to mount a wing on top of the engine cover. This arrangement has since been used by every team on the grid at one time or another, and in the 2007 Monaco Grand Prix all but two teams used them. These midwings are not to be confused either with the roll-hoop mounted cameras which each car carries as standard in all races, or with the bull-horn shaped flow controllers first used by McLaren and since by BMW Sauber, whose primary function is to smooth and redirect the airflow in order to make the rear wing more effective rather than to generate downforce themselves.

A variation on this theme was &quot;X-wings&quot;, high wings mounted on the front of the sidepods which used a similar loophole to midwings. These were first used by Tyrrell in 1997, and were last used in the 1998 San Marino Grand Prix, by which time Ferrari, Sauber, Jordan and others had used such an arrangement. However it was decided they would have to be banned in view of the obstruction they caused during refueling and the risk they posed to the driver should a car roll over.

Various other extra wings have been tried from time to time, but nowadays it is more common for teams to seek to improve the performance of the front and rear wings by the use of various flow controllers such as the afore-mentioned &quot;bull-horns&quot; used by McLaren.

<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Tursi (February 16, 1901 – April 22, 1989) was an Italian-American organized crime figure associated with San Juan, Puerto Rico from the 1950s to the 1970s. Within the history of crime in Puerto Rico, he attracted notice primarily for owning the notable nightclub &quot;La Riviera&quot;.

While his operations faced frequent interruptions by the Puerto Rican government, he managed to achieve success in the territory&#x27;s underworld for many years. One particular raid, he later recalled, had involved the arrest of over 300 women by anti-vice officers. The &quot;farce&quot;, as he called it, of police raids wound up frightening prostitutes off of the streets and rebounding things in his favor, with Tursi controlling his own established locations. Historian Stan Steiner labeled him as a &quot;night-club impresario&quot;.

==La Riviera==
Tursi gained fame as the owner of the &quot;La Riviera&quot;, a nightclub in San Juan, Puerto Rico well known for its association with easy prostitution. A popular attraction for not only locals but also expatriates and tourists, La Riveria faced the danger of constant raids by the police, though this didn&#x27;t phase Tursi.

==Politics==
Tursi also took interest in civic affairs. He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of San Juan as a political independent in 1968. His write-in campaign used the simple slogan &quot;Vota Por Tursi&quot;.

==Imprisonment==
In 1976, Tursi and his son Philip Tursi pleaded guilty to possessing 2,400 stolen blank tickets for Eastern Airlines. Part of the plea bargain deal involved granting youthful offender status and probation to Philip. On February 20, 1976, the court fined Anthony Tursi $5,000 and sentenced him to five years&#x27; imprisonment, to be served consecutively to a sentence in Puerto Rico. The court also sentenced fined Philip Tursi $5,000 and sentenced him to imprisonment of one year and one day. Anthony Tursi later appealed the verdict based on Philip&#x27;s sentence, but the appeal was denied.

==Death==
He was released on November 30, 1979. Tursi then retired to Nevada, where he died on April 22, 1989.

<doc id="475282" wikidata="Q1005917" url="?curid=475282" title="Mother Earth (novella)">
<text>&quot;Mother Earth&quot; is a science fiction novella by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was written from September 1 to October 10, 1948, and published in the May 1949 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. It was republished in Asimov&#x27;s 1972 short story collection &quot;The Early Asimov&quot;.

==Context within Asimov&#x27;s universe==
No individual robots appear, nonetheless Asimov said:

The term &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; appears at the end of the novel. The first of Asimovs &quot;Empire&quot; novels, &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, was written in 1947, the year before &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.
==Themes==
A major theme of the story is the way in which the Spacers have closed their thinly populated worlds to Earth&#x27;s crowded inhabitants. 

==Plot summary==

Earth faces a confrontation with its colonies, the &quot;Outer Worlds.&quot; A historian looks back and sees the problem beginning a century and a half earlier, when Aurora got permission to &quot;introduce positronic robots into their community life.&quot; No date is given, but fifty years before the story starts, the Outer Worlds established an immigration quota against incoming Terran citizens. The balance of power then tipped. Now war appears likely, and there are rumors that Earth has developed an unknown weapon, code-named the &quot;Pacific Project.&quot;

On Aurora, there is also concern, but the Aurorans decide that the threat cannot be serious. They use authoritarian methods to suppress Ion Mereanu and his Conservatives, who wish to help Earth. They then call a gathering on Hesperus, one of the Outer Worlds, to unite them against Earth.

There is some rivalry from two other planets, Rhea and Tethys. But Earth unexpectedly sends a threatening message to all of the worlds, uniting them against Earth. War follows, and Earth swiftly loses. Trade is ended—the Outer Worlds have no need of Earth&#x27;s exports, which are mostly agricultural. Earthmen are not allowed to journey beyond the Solar System.

The war was planned in the expectation of defeat—that was what the &quot;Pacific Project&quot; was all about. This is in part to force Earth to make necessary reforms including the use of robots, hydroponic agriculture, and population control. But the Outer Worlds will also weaken and split, because their worlds are biologically ill-suited to long-term human habitation. Several consequences for Earth are predicted from the entire conflict.
