<text>The Merced River (), in the central part of the U.S. state of California, is a -long tributary of the San Joaquin River flowing from the Sierra Nevada into the San Joaquin Valley. It is most well known for its swift and steep course through the southern part of Yosemite National Park, where it is the primary watercourse flowing through Yosemite Valley. The river&#x27;s character changes dramatically once it reaches the plains of the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, where it becomes a slow-moving meandering stream.

The river first formed as the Sierra Nevada rose about 10 million years ago, and sediment eroded from its canyon helped form the flat floor of the San Joaquin Valley. Glaciation during the ice ages carved the high elevation parts of the watershed, including Yosemite Valley, into their present shape. Historically, there was an extensive riparian zone which provided habitat for millions of migrating birds, and the river had one of the southernmost runs of chinook salmon in North America.

Miwok and Paiute people lived along the river for thousands of years before Spanish and Mexican military expeditions passed through in the early 19th century. The California Gold Rush brought many people into California and some settled in towns along the lower Merced River. A railroad was built along the Merced canyon, enabling mining and logging in the upper watershed, and later carrying tourists to Yosemite National Park. Conflicts between settlers and Native Americans resulted in wars, including the expulsion of the Ahwahnechee from Yosemite.

Large-scale irrigation was introduced to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Merced River are at at the foot of the Clark Range subrange of the Sierra Nevada, rising at the confluence of the Triple Peak Fork and Merced Peak Fork after they cascade down glacially polished slopes from the high country in the southeastern corner of Yosemite National Park. From its headwaters, the river flows north for a short distance and collects the Lyell Peak Fork. The course of the Merced then turns to the north west and flows through a steep walled canyon for where the river receives the Red Peak Fork and then collects into Washburn Lake, above sea level.

The Merced continues to the northwest for where collects into Merced Lake. Leaving Merced Lake, the river continues to the west northwest for where the canyons open up into Echo Valley. The river then turns generally westward for another , where it snakes through a spectacular narrow gorge between massive, glacially resistant granite cliffs. The gorge opens up after Bunnell Point and Sugarloaf Dome confine the river to form Bunnell Cascade, before turning southward through the Lost Valley of the Merced, and then spills over a granite cliff into Little Yosemite Valley, named for its resemblance to Yosemite Valley downstream.

The Merced River drops over Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall, together known as the &quot;Giant Staircase&quot;, then receives Illilouette Creek and flows into Yosemite Valley, where it meanders between pine forests and meadows that fill the valley floor. Tenaya, Yosemite, Bridalveil and Pigeon Creeks join the Merced River in Yosemite Valley. Beyond the glacial moraine at the western end of the valley the river flows through the steep Merced River Canyon, picks up Cascade Creek and turns south near El Portal. State Route 140 follows the river out of the west entrance to the national park, a few miles before the South Fork Merced River, the largest tributary, joins from the left.
The river arcs northwest to receive the North Fork, and a few miles after it enters Lake McClure, formed by New Exchequer Dam. Below New Exchequer, the river flows west through a heavily irrigated region of the Central Valley, passing through McSwain and Crocker-Huffman Dams and the cities of Hopeton, Delhi and Livingston. It joins the San Joaquin River at Hills Ferry, a few miles south of Turlock.

==Watershed==
The Merced River watershed encompasses in the central Sierra Nevada. To the north it is bordered by the watershed of the Tuolumne River, the other major river draining Yosemite National Park. On the south, the Merced watershed borders on the headwaters of the San Joaquin River. To the east, it is bordered by the Sierra crest which divides it from the endorheic Great Basin watershed of Mono Lake.

Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, where an alpine climate prevails. The Sierra receives heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts in the spring and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.

The Merced River is the third largest tributary of the San Joaquin River. Before irrigation started in the Central Valley and dams were constructed, the river&#x27;s natural flow at the mouth was much higher than the current average of , or about per year. Upstream on the river, at Happy Isles, the average flow is . The United States Geological Survey has river gauges at three locations along the Merced River: at Happy Isles, above Lake McClure, and at the mouth. The first two record flows unaffected by dams and human intervention, but discharge at the mouth is chiefly controlled by New Exchequer Dam. The Lake McClure gauge, located at the former mining town of Bagby, is probably the most accurate gauge for flows overall. The average annual flow recorded there was from 1923 to 1966. A peak of was reported there on December 23, 1955. For the mouth gauge, the highest flow was only in 1950. Finally, for the gauge at Happy Isles, the largest flow ever recorded was in the 1997 Yosemite floods, which destroyed many campgrounds, roads, paths, and bridges in the valley.

==Ecology==

According to a study in 2006, there were 37 fish species, 127 bird species, and 140 insect and invertebrate species found in the Merced River watershed. Due to differences in climate, there is a large disparity between species found in the upper watershed (above Lake McClure) and along the lower river.
There are 26 species of native and introduced fish in the lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls at the head of Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in the lower part of the river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.

Of the 127 bird species found along the Merced River, only 35 occur along the entire length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the breeding season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson&#x27;s hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin&#x27;s finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.

Many species of plants are found throughout the middle and upper basin, including California poppy, white alder, Oregon ash, oak, poison oak, bigleaf maple, Indian rhubarb, buttonbush, willow, whiteleaf manzanita, and historically, sugar pine, before heavy logging in the late 19th century. Squirrels, raccoon, jackrabbits, bats, skunks, beavers, mule deer, coyote, bobcat and black bear are among the mammal species found in the middle and upper watershed.

One species of interest is the limestone salamander, an extremely rare amphibian whose only habitat is the Merced Canyon downstream of Yosemite Valley. The salamander depends on the limestone walls of the Merced Canyon to survive. To protect the salamander, a segment of the canyon covering was designated an &quot;Area of Critical Environmental Concern&quot; in 1986.

==Geology==
When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards encountered the Pacific Plate approximately 250 million years ago during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.

Over about 80 million years, erosion caused the transportation of massive amounts of alluvial sediment to the floor of the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.

When the last glacial period or Ice Age arrived, a series of four tremendous valley glaciers filled the upper basin of the Merced River. These glaciers rose in branches upstream of Yosemite Valley, descending from the Merced River headwaters, Tenaya Canyon and Illilouette Creek. Tenaya Canyon was actually eroded even deeper by an arm of the Tuolumne Glacier, which formed the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and Hetch Hetchy Valley on the Tuolumne River in the north. Little Yosemite Valley formed as a result of the underlying rock being harder than that below the Giant Staircase, the cliff wall containing Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall. These three branches of each glacier combined to form one large glacier about thick at maximum, stretching downstream past the mouth of Yosemite Valley, well into Merced Canyon. These glaciers formed the granite cliffs that now constitute landmarks such as Half Dome, El Capitán, and Cloud&#x27;s Rest.

The first and largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced watershed to an extent close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left at the mouth of Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.

==History==
Of the many Native American tribes that have lived on the Merced River the most prominent were the Miwok (consisting of Plains Miwok and Sierra Miwok), Paiute, and Ahwahnechee. Many Plains Miwok settled in the lowlands along the lower Merced River. The Sierra (or Mountain) Miwok lived in the upper Merced Canyon and in Yosemite Valley, and at the time the first white explorers came to the area, there were about 450 Sierra Miwok split among ten permanent villages. Paiute, of origin from the eastern Sierra near the Mono Lake area, also lived in the upper watershed of the Merced River. The Sierra Miwok and Mono Lake Paiute eventually, through cultural interaction over time, formed a new culture, the Ahwahnechee, derived from &quot;Ahwahnee&quot;, meaning &quot;the valley shaped like a big mouth&quot; (referring to U-shaped Yosemite Valley).

In the early 19th century, several military expeditions sent by Spanish colonists from coastal California traveled into the Central Valley. One of these trips, headed by lieutenant Gabriel Moraga, arrived on the south bank of the Merced River on September 29, 1806. They named the river &quot;Rio de Nuestra Señora de la Merced&quot; (River of Our Lady of Mercy), who is the patron saint of the diocese of Barcelona and is celebrated on September 24. Another expedition to the Central Valley in 1805 also named the Kings River upon reaching it on January 6, 1805, which is the feast of the Magi or Epiphany. Moraga&#x27;s expedition was part of a series of exploratory ventures, funded by the Spanish government, to find suitable sites for missions in the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. In 1808 and 1810, Moraga led further expeditions along the lower Merced River below Merced Canyon, each time coming to nothing. Eventually, plans to establish a mission chain in the Valley were abandoned. In 1855, Merced County was created, named after the Merced River.

Following the establishment of Merced County and the independence of California from Mexico, many settlers came to the Merced River area and established small towns on the Merced River. One of the first was Dover, established in 1844 at the confluence of the Merced River with the San Joaquin River. Dover functioned as an &quot;inland seaport&quot; where boats delivered supplies from the San Francisco Bay area to settlers in the San Joaquin Valley. Some towns that followed were Hopeton, Snelling and Merced Falls, the latter named for a set of rapids on the Merced River near the present-day site of McSwain Dam. In the late 1880s a flour mill, woolen mill and a few lumber mills were constructed at Merced Falls. The Sugar Pine Lumber Company and Yosemite Lumber Company operated lumber mills at Merced Falls for over thirty years, relying on narrow-gauge railroads to ship lumber from the Sierra Nevada along the Merced River. Following the construction of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads, many of the river towns on the Merced River were deserted. Several cities that did achieve prominence, however, include Merced and Turlock, both located on the railroad.
The California Gold Rush in the 1850s saw gradually increasing mining in Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley. Many Native Americans in the area revolted, leading to conflicts between miners and the Ahwahnechee. In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was formed to drive the remaining Ahwahnechee out of the valley into reservations. The Battalion fought an Ahwahnechee group led by Chief Tenaya over the South Fork of the Merced River. Eventually, they succeeded in driving most of the Indians out of the Yosemite Valley, first into a reservation near Fresno. Following the gold rush, the Ahwahnechee were allowed back into Yosemite Valley, but further incidents prompted a second battalion to drive them out, this time to the Mono Lake area. Many place names in the valley have their origin from the Mariposa Battalion.

Even before the establishment of Yosemite National Park, tourists began to travel into the Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley as early as 1855. The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s. The first was Coulterville Road, followed by Big Oak Flat Road, a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon. Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. With the creation of the national park tourism to the Valley and the Merced River increased significantly, leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed. Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed, including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest.

The Yosemite Valley Railroad, originally established with the discovery of mineral deposits in Yosemite Valley and Merced Canyon, continued functioning through the early 20th century carrying tourists to Yosemite Valley along the Merced River. El Portal Road, constructed through Merced Canyon in 1926, put an end to passenger service on the railway, but operations continued until the mid-1940s, when major flooding occurred, destroying sections of the railroad.
In the early 20th century, when the upper Merced River basin lay mostly protected, the lower river was the subject of dam-building and irrigation diversions by the Merced Irrigation District. The District proposed the Exchequer Dam, completed in the mid-1920s and raised in the 1960s, as a water storage facility on the Merced River.

Irrigation with water from the Merced River continued to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was to such an extent that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery&#x27;s pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.

Yosemite Valley saw significant amounts of damage when the river flooded the valley in 1997.

In 2024 the New York Times reported that farmers and growers had drained significant volumes of water during the 2022 drought leaving part of the Merced dry without authorities being aware.

==River modifications==

Despite its partial status as a National Wild and Scenic River, the Merced River has many dams and irrigation diversions. New Exchequer Dam is the largest dam on the river and forms Lake McClure, which holds of water for irrigation, flood control and hydropower generation. This modern structure was preceded by the old Exchequer Dam forming Exchequer Reservoir. The old concrete arch dam, completed in 1926, was flooded out when the new concrete-faced rockfill dam was built in 1967, but occasionally reappears during periods of low water.

Downstream of New Exchequer Dam is McSwain Dam, which serves as a regulating forebay for New Exchequer Dam and also generates power. Below this dam is Merced Falls Dam, an irrigation diversion dam. The lowermost, the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, was built in 1906 and completely blocks the passage of anadromous fish up the Merced River.
Together, these diversions remove almost half the natural flow of the Merced River, and an even greater proportion during dry years. For several months in 2022, all of the water in the river was diverted to agriculture.

Cascades Diversion Dam was a timber crib dam built in 1917 near where the Merced River flows out of Yosemite Valley. Originally built to generate hydropower, the dam was decommissioned in 1985 but remained standing for a number of years afterward. After the great flood of 1997, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation surveyed the dam and found it in danger of failure. Classified as a &quot;high hazard&quot; structure, it was originally considered for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places but was deemed too dangerous, and was subsequently removed. Today, the Merced River above Lake McClure is completely free-flowing and unobstructed by any dams.

The Merced Irrigation District (MID) operates most of the irrigation infrastructure on the lower river, which supplies water to of farmland. As a whole, the system includes about 4,000 control gates and of canals and laterals. Irrigation has taken most of the water out of the lower river, which is often reduced to a small stream where it joins the San Joaquin. Irrigation return flows carry pesticides, fertilizer and other pollutants into the river. The MID is federally required to allow at least of water annually to flow continually down the river, not including floodwater releases.

==Recreation==

The Merced River and its tributaries are a popular recreational area in part because of Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River and its tributaries include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.

The name &quot;Railroad Flat&quot; originates from the Yosemite Valley Railroad, which once travelled up Merced River Canyon into Yosemite Valley. The old railroad grade still exists, and is now the site of a public trail. Many other trails lead throughout the Merced River watershed, notably the John Muir Trail, which starts near Happy Isles and climbs the Giant Staircase, past Vernal and Nevada Falls, into Little Yosemite Valley and north along Sunrise Creek to join the Pacific Crest Trail near Tuolumne Meadows. Trails also follow the river through Little Yosemite Valley to the headwaters area, and along Illilouette, Bridalveil, Yosemite, Alder and Chilnualna Creeks, and the lower South Fork of the Merced River. There are no trails along some segments, including the lower Bridalveil Creek, upper South Fork, and specifically Tenaya Canyon, which is extremely dangerous.

<text>Charles Bowers Momsen (June 21, 1896 – May 25, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Swede&quot;, was born in Flushing, New York. He was an American pioneer in submarine rescue for the United States Navy, and he invented the underwater escape device later called the &quot;Momsen lung&quot;, for which he received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1929. In May 1939, Momsen directed the rescue of the crew of &quot;Squalus&quot; (SS-192).

==Early years in the Navy==
Momsen entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1914, but he was dismissed after a widespread cheating scandal during the spring of his first year there. However, Momsen pursued another appointment to the Academy, received it, repeated his plebe year, and graduated in 1919 — one year early, due to the involvement of the United States in World War I.

From 1919 to 1921, Momsen served on the battleship . In 1921, he entered the Naval Submarine School in New London, Connecticut, graduating in January 1922. Eighteen months later, he took command of the submarine . A few years later, he was given command of , one of the newest US Navy designed submarines of that time.

==Diving and rescue==

===Early interest===
It was aboard &quot;S-1&quot; Momsen&#x27;s attention became drawn to the urgent need for a way to rescue trapped submariners.

On September 25, 1925, &quot;S-1&quot;″s sister ship, , collided with freighter &quot;City of Rome&quot; in the vicinity of Block Island and sank in of water. Momsen was ordered to take &quot;S-1&quot; to search for the crippled submarine. &quot;S-1&quot; found the oil slick marking the spot where &quot;S-51&quot; had sunk, but without any sonar, there was no way for his crew to locate her on the bottom, nor was there a way for trapped crewmen to escape.

Momsen began to look for ways to rescue submariners. He conceived a diving bell, which could be lowered to a submarine in distress, mated to an escape hatch, and opened to allow trapped submariners to climb in. A watertight seal to the submarine could be achieved by placing a rubber gasket around the diving bell&#x27;s bottom and reducing the air pressure once the bell was over the escape hatch. Then, the hatch could be opened, and the trapped submariners could climb aboard.

Momsen diagrammed his idea and sent it up the chain of command. He waited more than a year for a response, heard nothing, and concluded there must have been something technically wrong with the concept.

Momsen&#x27;s next tour of duty took him to the Submarine Division of the Bureau of Construction and Repair. Shortly after he reported aboard, he came across his diving bell drawings. They had been disapproved as impractical. He stated his case again, but to no avail.

Shortly thereafter, in December 1927, another submarine, the , sank off Cape Cod. All forty of her crew died. Six sailors survived three days in the forward torpedo room, but had no way to escape.

===The Momsen lung===
After the 1927 &quot;S-4&quot; incident, Momsen began working on a device to help trapped submariners escape safely to the surface. Officially called the Submarine Escape Lung, it consisted of an oblong rubber bag that recycled exhaled air. This idea has been patented and tested by Henry Fleuss since 1879. German submarines had those &quot;Tauchretter&quot; as standard issue since 1912. The local press enthusiastically received the &quot;new&quot; device and they dubbed it the &quot;Momsen lung&quot;, a name that stuck in the US.

The Momsen lung contains a canister of soda lime, which removes poisonous carbon dioxide from the exhaled air and then replenishes the air with oxygen. Two tubes lead from the bag to a mouthpiece: one with which to inhale air and the other with which to exhale spent air. The device hangs around the wearer&#x27;s neck and is strapped around the waist. Besides providing oxygen for the ascent, it also allows a submariner to rise slowly to the surface, thus avoiding embolisms.

Between June 1929 and September 1932, Lieutenant Momsen developed the lung along with Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate Clarence L. Tibbals and Frank M. Hobson, a civilian employee of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (later the Bureau of Ships). In 1929, Momsen received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for personally testing the device at a depth of .

The Momsen lung saved its first lives in October 1944, when eight submariners used it to reach the surface after sank in of water in the East China Sea.

The Momsen lung was eventually supplemented by the Steinke hood and free-ascent techniques.

==The diving bell==
Momsen returned to his diving bell idea in 1930. He built a prototype, constructed from a water-tight aircraft hangar pirated from &quot;S-1&quot; and tested it off Key West, Florida. Momsen stated the bell was unstable, tipped, and leaked, and had several changes in mind for the diving bell, but was sent to the Bureau of Construction and Repair to teach submariners how to use the Momsen lung before he could make the changes. He charged Lieutenant Commander Al McCann to make the changes he wanted and McCann was put in charge of the final revisions on the Momsen / McCann diving bell. When the redesigned diving bell was completed in late 1930, it was introduced as the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber. The final bell, with the revisions and changes that Momsen authorized, included a floor bulkhead, pneumatic winch and a pressure seal allowing direct transfer of survivors to the diving bell in a dry environment.

===Gas mixtures===
From 1937 to 1939, Momsen led an experimental deep-sea diving unit at the Washington Navy Yard which achieved a major breakthrough in the physiology of the human lung&#x27;s gas mixtures under high pressure. At depths greater than , on pure oxygen, and , on air, the oxygen turns toxic. Underwater, breathing air, nitrogen enters the blood, then tissues, and below may cause euphoria commonly called &quot;nitrogen narcosis&quot;. Also, divers who ascend too rapidly can get decompression sickness, commonly known as &quot;the bends,&quot; which happens when nitrogen in the blood forms bubbles. These bubbles can block blood flow and cause intense pain, even death.

In experiments often performed by Momsen himself, the team replaced the nitrogen with nontoxic helium and mixed it with varying levels of oxygen depending on the depth. Today&#x27;s divers use the knowledge to operate safely deeper than .

==The &quot;Squalus&quot; rescue==


Momsen, already famous for the invention of his Momsen lung, achieved even more fame for directing the rescue and recovery of the 33 crewmen of the submarine &quot;Squalus&quot;, which sank in May 1939 in of water off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire. Working from the submarine rescue ship , Momsen instructed the team of deep-sea divers as they dived to the submarine and attached cables to the rescue chamber. He also supervised rescue chamber operators as it made four dives to bring the submariners to the surface and a fifth to check the flooded aft section for survivors. The fourth dive was marred by a cable jam, and the chamber had to be hauled to the surface by hand over hand pulling by all on board. All 33 surviving crewmen were rescued. Twenty-six men had perished.

Momsen led the diving operations in the effort to salvage the &quot;Squalus&quot;, which took 113 days. She was taken to the drydock at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.

Along with Commander McCann, Momsen received a letter of commendation from President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the successful rescue of the crewmen from the &quot;Squalus&quot; and the subsequent salvage of the submarine. After her repairs, the &quot;Squalus&quot; was renamed the USS &quot;Sailfish&quot;, and the name &quot;Squalus&quot; was never used by the U.S. Navy again.

==World War II==
During World War II, Momsen served as Commander, Submarine Squadron 2 (ComSubRon 2) and Commander, Submarine Squadron 4 (ComSubRon 4). While Momsen was ComSubRon 2 in the U.S. Pacific Fleet, captains under his command reported their Mark 14 torpedoes were not functioning properly. When fired from the preferred perpendicular angle of impact, the torpedoes did not always explode. However, when fired to hit at acute angles, the torpedoes usually exploded. When officers of Momsen&#x27;s own squadron complained, he decided to find out why. He took torpedoes to the shallow waters and sheer cliffs of the Hawaiian Island of Kahoolawe and fired until he got a dud. Then, risking his own life, he dove into the water to find the unexploded torpedo. With help, he recovered the dangerous live torpedo and brought it on board. A small problem with the firing pin inside the primer cap of the warhead was causing the duds: it was becoming crushed, rather than firing the warhead.

In Fall 1943, ComSubPac initiated the Navy&#x27;s first wolfpack. Momsen drilled his captains and their executive officers in tactics, planning to have three boats act in company, one boat making the first attack on a convoy then acting as &quot;trailer&quot;, while the other two attacked alternatively on either flank afterward. He also developed a simple code for communications on the short range VHF radio system used for Talk Between Ships (TBS). The pack consisted of Edgar McGregor&#x27;s , experienced skipper Dave White&#x27;s new , and , fresh from refit in Mare Island (and with one of the Submarine Force&#x27;s first deck guns), under newcomer John Moore. Momsen, without any combat experience, flew his flag in &quot;Cero&quot;.

The pack arrived in the East China Sea in October 1943. It proved unable to solve the problems of communication and risk of fratricide, and made only one joint attack on a single convoy, but was credited at the time with sinking five Japanese ships for 88,000 tons and damaging eight others for 63,000 tons between them. (This was reduced to three sunk for 23,500 tons by JANAC postwar.) Momsen also received the Legion of Merit for work on the Navy&#x27;s wolfpacks from February 1943 to June 1944. Momsen earned a Navy Cross for his efforts.

Momsen commanded the battleship from December 1944 through August 1945. For his distinguished service in command, Momsen was awarded a Gold Star (with Combat &quot;V&quot;), in lieu of a third award of the Legion of Merit.

== Military decorations==
In addition to the Navy Cross once and the Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars (to show repeat awards) and &quot;V&quot; device, Momsen earned the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Army Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal with &quot;V&quot; device, World War I Victory Medal with escort clasp, American Defense Service Medal with Fleet Clasp, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with four service stars, World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal with one bronze star and the Submarine Warfare insignia.

==Later years==
In November 1945, he directed a fleet of nearly 200 surplus Army and Navy ships, manned by Japanese crews, that evacuated the first of nearly six million Japanese from Manchuria, Formosa, and islands in the Pacific.

Momsen served on the Navy General Board from June 1947 until May 1948. He served as Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Undersea Warfare from 1948 to 1951, then became Commander of the Submarine Force&#x27;s Pacific Fleet. Momsen also took part in developing the streamlined submarine. To avoid Navy interference, Admiral Momsen directed Bureau of Ships to design an unarmed submarine for speed, and told the Navy that the submarine would be a practice target for anti-submarine aircraft from aircraft carriers.

Vice Admiral Momsen died of cancer on May 25, 1967. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Namesake==
The 42nd guided missile destroyer, is named in his honor.

Momsen Hall, the 75-man Bachelor Officer Quarters at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Andros Island, Bahamas, was named in his honor in 1969.

On November 10, 2009, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s newest trainer, the Submarine Escape Trainer, was named in honor of Admiral Momsen in ceremonies at the New London Submarine Base.

<doc id="471476" wikidata="Q751930" url="?curid=471476" title="Astronomical system of units">
<text>The astronomical system of units, formerly called the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, is a system of measurement developed for use in astronomy. It was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 via Resolution No. 1, and has been significantly updated in 1994 and 2009 (see &quot;Astronomical constant&quot;).

The system was developed because of the difficulties in measuring and expressing astronomical data in International System of Units (SI units). In particular, there is a huge quantity of very precise data relating to the positions of objects within the Solar System that cannot conveniently be expressed or processed in SI units. Through a number of modifications, the astronomical system of units now explicitly recognizes the consequences of general relativity, which is a necessary addition to the International System of Units in order to accurately treat astronomical data.

The astronomical system of units is a tridimensional system, in that it defines units of length, mass and time. The associated astronomical constants also fix the different frames of reference that are needed to report observations. The system is a conventional system, in that neither the unit of length nor the unit of mass are true physical constants, and there are at least three different measures of time.

== Astronomical unit of time ==

The astronomical unit of time is the day, defined as seconds. 365.25 days make up one Julian year. The symbol &quot;D&quot; is used in astronomy to refer to this unit.

== Astronomical unit of mass ==

The astronomical unit of mass is the solar mass. The symbol is often used to refer to this unit.
The solar mass (), , is a standard way to express mass in astronomy, used to describe the masses of other stars and galaxies. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about times the mass of the Earth or 1 048 times the mass of Jupiter.

In practice, the masses of celestial bodies appear in the dynamics of the Solar System only through the products &quot;GM&quot;, where &quot;G&quot; is the constant of gravitation. In the past, &quot;GM&quot; of the Sun could be determined experimentally with only limited accuracy. Its present accepted value is .

=== Jupiter mass ===

Jupiter mass ( or &quot;M&quot;JUP), is the unit of mass equal to the total mass of the planet Jupiter, . Jupiter mass is used to describe masses of the gas giants, such as the outer planets and extrasolar planets. It is also used in describing brown dwarfs and Neptune-mass planets.

=== Earth mass ===

Earth mass () is the unit of mass equal to that of the Earth. 1 = . Earth mass is often used to describe masses of rocky terrestrial planets. It is also used to describe Neptune-mass planets. One Earth mass is times a Jupiter mass.

== Astronomical unit of length ==

The astronomical unit of length is now defined as exactly 149 597 870 700 meters. It is approximately equal to the mean Earth–Sun distance. It was formerly defined as that length for which the Gaussian gravitational constant (&quot;k&quot;) takes the value when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time. The dimensions of &quot;k&quot;2 are those of the constant of gravitation (&quot;G&quot;), i.e., L3M−1T−2. The term &quot;unit distance&quot; is also used for the length &quot;A&quot; while, in general usage, it is usually referred to simply as the &quot;astronomical unit&quot;, symbol au.

An equivalent formulation of the old definition of the astronomical unit is the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of radians per day. 
The speed of light in IAU is the defined value &quot;c&quot;0 =  of the SI units. In terms of this speed, the old definition of the astronomical unit of length had the accepted value: 1 au = &quot;c&quot;0&quot;τ&quot;A = () m, where &quot;τ&quot;A is the transit time of light across the astronomical unit. The astronomical unit of length was determined by the condition that the measured data in the ephemeris match observations, and that in turn decides the transit time &quot;τ&quot;A.

=== Other units for astronomical distances ===

The distances to distant galaxies are typically not quoted in distance units at all, but rather in terms of redshift. The reasons for this are that converting redshift to distance requires knowledge of the Hubble constant, which was not accurately measured until the early 21st century, and that at cosmological distances, the curvature of spacetime allows one to come up with multiple definitions for distance. For example, the distance as defined by the amount of time it takes for a light beam to travel to an observer is different from the distance as defined by the apparent size of an object.

<text>Fouad Abdallah Chehab ( / ; 19 March 1902 – 25 April 1973) was a Lebanese general and statesman who served as president of Lebanon from 1958 to 1964. He is considered to be the founder of the Lebanese Army after Lebanon gained independence from France, and became its first commander in 1946.

Born in Ghazir to a family that traced its origins to nobility, Chehab joined the French Army in 1919. He was appointed Prime Minister of Lebanon by the outgoing president Bechara El Khoury, who resigned due to widespread demonstrations against his administration, and tasked Chehab with the role of organizing the next presidential election, in which Camille Chamoun was elected.

During the 1958 Lebanon crisis between Chamoun and Muslim leaders, he prevented the army from siding with the government or the opposition, and refused any request to do so. This decision helped keep the army unified and limited losses. He was elected President of Lebanon in the 1958 election, being considered a &quot;consensus option&quot; both internationally and locally, and succeeded Chamoun.

As President, Chehab is credited for introducing reforms and social development projects and building modern state institutions. However, his rule was described as autocratic, and saw an increase in the role of military and intelligence in politics. His political approaches, known as &quot;Chehabism&quot; influenced later presidents Charles Helou and Élias Serkis. He died in 1973, two years before the civil war.

== Early life ==
Born in 1902, Chehab was the eldest son of Abdallah Chehab and Badiaa Hbeich, and had two younger brothers, Farid and Chakib. He was a member of the Maronite Christian family of Chehab, a dynasty which ruled Mount Lebanon under Ottoman rule until the establishment of the Mutasarrifate in 1842. His great-grandfather, Hassan Chehab, was the eldest brother of Bashir Shihab II, who ruled Lebanon for 40 years. Chehab&#x27;s father Abdallah tried to immigrate to the United States in 1910, but the family never heard from him again. He was last seen in Marseille and it has been speculated that he died while on a ship transporting him there.

== Military career (1921–1958) ==
=== French Army (1921–1946) ===
In 1921, Chehab joined the French Military School in Damascus, Syria, and graduated as a lieutenant in 1923. He was promoted to captain in 1929, and headed the Rashaya casern. He later studied at the École Supérieure de Guerre in Paris, France, during the 1930s.

=== Commander of the Lebanese Army (1946–1958) ===
Chehab became Commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces in 1945, at which time Lebanon gained its independence upon the end of the French mandate. 

In 1952, Chehab refused to allow the army to interfere in the uprising that forced Lebanese President Bechara El Khoury to resign. Chehab became the Prime Minister of Lebanon in September 1952, and hold the additional portfolio of defense minister. Chehab was then appointed president with the duty to ensure an emergency democratic presidential election. Four days later, Camille Chamoun was elected to succeed El Khoury. Chehab was again defense minister from 1956 to 1957.

The gerrymandering and the electoral fraud of the 1957 parliamentary election, followed by the dismissal of several pro &quot;pan-Arab&quot; ministers, sparked a pan-Arab Muslim revolt which progressed to the 1958 crisis.

== Presidency (1958–1964) ==
To quell the uprising, Chamoun, with the help of his assistant Tanner Wilhelm Hale, requested American intervention, and US Marines soon landed in Beirut. Widely trusted by the Muslims for his impartiality and now supported by the Americans, Chehab was chosen as the consensus candidate to succeed Chamoun as president to restore peace to the country. On taking office, Chehab declared, &quot;The revolution has no winners and no losers&quot;. Following a path of moderation and co-operating closely with the various religious groups, and with both secular and religious forces, Chehab was able to cool tensions and bring stability back to the nation.

In 1960, two years into his six-year presidential mandate, seeing that the country had been stabilised and having paved the way for reforms, Chehab offered to resign. However, he was persuaded by members of the Lebanese Parliament to remain in office for the rest of his mandate. On the New Year of 1962, he suppressed an attempted coup by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which had been infuriated over his associations with the Nasser regime. To hinder such future threats, he strengthened the Lebanese intelligence and security services to prevent any further foreign interference in Lebanese internal affairs.

Chehab&#x27;s rule was a delicate balancing act of maintaining relative harmony between the nation&#x27;s Christian and Muslim populations. He followed the path and principles of dialogue and moderation coupled with public reforms, which came to be known as Chehabism. Generally deeply respected for his honesty and integrity, Chehab is credited with a number of reform plans and regulations to create a modern administration and efficient public services. That eventually brought him into conflict with the traditional feudal, confessional, and clan-based politicians, who saw their grip on power diminishing.

In 1964, Chehab, whose presence at the head of the country was still seen by many as the best option for stability and future reforms, refused to allow the Lebanese Constitution to be amended to permit him to run for another presidential term. He backed the candidacy of Charles Helou, who became the next president. Chehab later became dissatisfied with Helou&#x27;s presidency over the perceived mishandling of the armed presence of Palestinian guerrillas in Southern Lebanon and over Helou&#x27;s maneuvers to pave the way for the traditional feudal politicians to regain power.

== Later life (1964–1973) ==
Chehab was widely expected to contest the presidential election of 1970, but in a historical declaration, he declared that his experience in office had convinced him that the people of his country were not ready to put aside traditional or feudal politics or to support him in building a modern state. He chose to endorse his protégé, Elias Sarkis, instead. In the closest vote in Lebanese history, Sarkis lost the election to the feudal leader Suleiman Frangieh by a single vote in the National Assembly. The election was regarded as a defeat for the old statesman and marked the end of the Chehabist reforms and era.

The first months of the Frangieh mandate saw the dismantling of the country&#x27;s intelligence and security services, which had been built by Chehab. They were feared and accused of maintaining a strong grip on political life. That, however, allowed rapidly increasing multiple foreign interference in the internal affairs of the country, soon manifesting itself into a Palestinian military presence in 1973 and the onset of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. Fouad Chehab died in Beirut in April 1973, at the age of 71.

== Personal life==
Chehab was married to Rose René Poitieux, a French national.
== Legacy ==

=== Image ===

Chehab is seen as the greatest president of the country by several politicians such as Raymond Eddé, journalists such as Samir Atallah and Jihad Al Khazen, and commentators such as Ziad Rahbani. Sheikh Maher Hammoud said that he is the only pre-Taif president who deserved major executive powers. 

=== Honors ===
In 2008, the council of ministers named him as one of the &quot;men of independence&quot;. The Jounieh municipal stadium was renamed &quot;Fouad Chehab stadium&quot; in 1994.

In 2016, his house in Jounieh was established as a museum. The project reportedly cost $1.5 million.

<text>Viscount Portman, in the County of Somerset, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 28 March 1873, for the former Lord Lieutenant of Somerset and Liberal Member of Parliament Edward Portman, 1st Baron Portman. He had already been created Baron Portman, of Orchard Portman, on 27 January 1837, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Viscount, represented Shaftesbury and Dorset in the House of Commons as a Liberal. , the titles have been held by one of the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandsons, the tenth Viscount, since 1999.

The family post-1728 is descended in the male line from a junior line of Berkeley of Stoke Gifford, one of whom married the daughter of Joan Portman, the great-granddaughter of Sir William Portman, Lord Chief Justice of England, between 1555 and 1557. He acquired land in Marylebone, London, which developed under Henry William Portman into the Portman Estate, a cornerstone of the family&#x27;s wealth. The judge&#x27;s grandson was created a baronet in 1612 (see Portman Baronets). In its third generation, when Sir William Portman, 6th Baronet, died in 1690 without progeny, the bulk of the estates passed to a husband of the family: Henry Seymour (d.1728), MP, 5th son of Sir Edward Seymour, 3rd Baronet of Berry Pomeroy, Devon (by coverture applying to his wife Anne Portman, second daughter of Sir John Portman, 1st Baronet). Seymour took the surname Portman in lieu of his patronymic, but left no issue. The property then devolved to another cousin, William Berkeley (d.1737) of Pylle, Somerset, who likewise took the surname Portman. His great-grandson was Edward Berkeley Portman (1771–1823), MP for Dorset and father of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman.

The family seat was Bryanston House, near Bryanston, Dorset, which has been a large private school since 1928.

<doc id="471485" wikidata="Q124175" url="?curid=471485" title="George Blaurock">
<text>Jörg vom Haus Jacob (&quot;George of the House of Jacob&quot;; also Georg Cajacob), commonly known as George Blaurock (c. 1491 – September 6, 1529), was an Anabaptist leader and evangelist. Along with Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz, he was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren in Zürich, and thereby one of the founders of Anabaptism.

==Biography==
George Blaurock was born in 1491 in Bonaduz in Graubünden, in the Swiss Confederacy. He was educated at the University of Leipzig and served as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church until his conversion to evangelical Anabaptism. Blaurock had evidently departed from the Catholic Church before he arrived in Zürich circa 1524, for he had already taken a wife. Though he came to see Huldrych Zwingli, he soon became attached to the more radical followers of Zwingli. These &quot;radicals&quot; insisted on following only that which had Biblical support. They rejected the mass, images, and infant baptism. The city council condemned their position, ordered them to desist from their meetings, and ordered all unbaptized babies to be baptized within eight days. On January 21, 1525, the despondent group held a secret meeting at the home of Felix Manz. These believers went to their knees in prayer for guidance. Arising from the prayer, George Blaurock asked Conrad Grebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith in Christ. Grebel did so, and afterward Blaurock proceeded to baptize the others who were present.

George Blaurock worked closely with Felix Manz until Manz was martyred in Zürich on January 5, 1527. On that same day, Blaurock was severely beaten and permanently expelled from Zürich. He kept moving, laboring at Bern, Biel, the Grisons, and Appenzell. After his arrest and fourth banishment in April 1527, Blaurock left Switzerland never to return.

He then turned to the County of Tyrol. In 1529 he became the pastor of the church in Adige Valley, after their former pastor, Michael Kürschner, was burned at the stake. Blaurock conducted a very successful ministry in Tyrol. Many believers were baptized and churches founded. The example of discipleship in full communities of goods that began among the churches that Blaurock started continues to be a source of inspiration to intentional communities such as the Hutterites and the Bruderhof. In August he and Hans Langegger were arrested by Innsbruck authorities. While in captivity they were tortured for information. On September 6, 1529, Blaurock and Langegger were burned at the stake near Klausen.

The only writings left by Blaurock were a letter and two hymns written during his last three weeks of life. The hymns are entitled &quot;Gott Führt Ein Recht Gericht&quot; (&quot;God Holds a Righteous Judgment&quot;) and &quot;Gott, dich will ich loben&quot; (&quot;God, You I Will Praise&quot;). Both hymns are preserved in the &quot;Ausbund&quot;, an old Anabaptist hymnal still used by the Amish.

:&quot;Gott, dich will ich loben&quot;
:1. Lord God, how do I praise Thee
:From hence and evermore,

<text>XXX Corps (30 Corps) was a corps of the British Army during the Second World War. The corps was formed in the Western Desert in September 1941. It provided extensive service in the North African Campaign and many of its units were in action at the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. It then took part in the Tunisia Campaign and formed the left flank during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943.

It returned briefly to the United Kingdom; it then served in the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944. In September 1944, it formed the Garden (cross land) contingent of Operation Market Garden; due to the failure of the Market (airborne) contingent to seize the bridge at Nijmegen, XXX Corps arrived too late at the subsequent ()and ultimateArnhem bridge, effectively resulting in the loss of the British 1st Airborne Division in the prolonged Battle of Arnhem. XXX Corps continued to serve in the Netherlands, and finally in Operation Veritable in Germany until May 1945.

==North Africa Campaign==
XXX Corps was formed in the Western Desert under Lieutenant-General Vyvyan Pope in September 1941. It played a major role in the Western Desert Campaign, where it was initially formed for the British armoured units in North Africa in preparation for Operation Crusader, the last British attempt to relieve the siege of Tobruk.

XXX Corps suffered many casualties, mainly because of obsolete British tank tactics (especially charging anti-tank guns), but finally forced the Panzerarmee Afrika to withdraw to El Agheila in Central Libya. In spring 1942, Rommel had counter-attacked and driven the British back to Gazala, a few miles west of Tobruk. The plan of the Eighth Army Commander Neil Ritchie was to have XIII Corps hold the line, while XXX Corps would stop any attempt to outflank the position south of Bir Hachiem, held by the 1st Free French Brigade. They managed to slow the Afrika Korps tanks into &quot;The Cauldron&quot;, the gap left in the British Lines by the destruction of the 150th Infantry Brigade, part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division in late May 1942. British counterattacks attempted to crush it but failed. Eventually, the Free French at Bir Hachiem were forced to withdraw and Rommel was able to break out of the Cauldron. XXX Corps was forced to retreat to Mersa Matruh, held by the new X Corps. The Germans quickly broke through, surrounded X Corps (which fortunately for the British, managed to break out) and pushed XXX Corps back to El Alamein in June 1942.

===El Alamein===
The depleted XXX Corps pulled back to El Alamein, the last defensible position west of the River Nile. It was the only place in the Western Desert campaign in which there would not be an open flank (a normal rule of desert warfare), due to the soft ground of the Qattara Depression, immediately south of the opposing forces and the Mediterranean Sea. The northern, coastal sector was assigned to XXX Corps.

Due to casualties and equipment losses, XXX Corps was reinforced at Alamein by the attachment of units from other Commonwealth armies (that had been attached to XIII Corps), the 1st South African Infantry Division and the 9th Australian Infantry Division. The corps&#x27;s other main unit was the British 23rd Armoured Brigade Group.

In July 1942, XXX Corps again suffered many casualties, at the First Battle of El Alamein, although a major Axis offensive was repelled. Willoughby Norrie was replaced as corps commander by William Ramsden.

In August, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, dismissed Claude Auchinleck as commander-in-chief of Middle East Command and General Officer Commanding (GOC), Eighth Army. Auchinleck was replaced as Allied commander by Harold Alexander and as GOC, Eighth Army by William Gott (previously commander of XIII Corps). Gott was killed soon afterwards, when the aircraft carrying him was shot down; he was replaced by Bernard Montgomery.

At the end of August, Rommel again decided to attempt a breakthrough, this time at the southern end of the line in the Battle of Alam Halfa. While this was directed mainly at XIII Corps, XXX Corps was the subject of several diversionary raids. In September, Ramsden was replaced by Oliver Leese.

XXX Corps was to be the focus of Montgomery&#x27;s first offensive, codenamed Operation Lightfoot. The 2nd New Zealand Division (previously XIII Corps), the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and the 4th Indian Infantry Division, along with the 9th Armoured Brigade were added to the corps.

On the night of 24/25 October, Lightfoot commenced with a prolonged and intense artillery bombardment, XXX Corps attacked and quickly suffered many casualties but the Australian, New Zealand, South African and Highland divisions continued to attack, creating several gaps in the minefields, before German resistance stopped further advances. To bring XXX Corps up to strength, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (XIII Corps) was added.

Early on the morning of 2 November, X Corps and XXX Corps launched the fourth phase of Lightfoot, codenamed Operation Supercharge. By 4 November the tanks of X Corps had broken through and the British had won the Second Battle of El Alamein.

The 9th Australian Division was transferred to the South West Pacific theatre. The 1st South African Division was left in Egypt. After El Alamein, XXX Corps pushed forward steadily. It stopped its advance at the Mareth Line in Tunisia in late February 1943.

===Tunisia===
On 19 March, XXX Corps launched an attack on the Mareth Line as part of Operation Pugilist, with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in the lead. They managed to create a gap but it was quickly contained by the 15th Panzer Division. During &quot;Operation Supercharge II&quot; a force commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks composed of the New Zealand Corps and the 1st Armoured Division from X Corps exploited a flanking position established by the New Zealanders during &quot;Pugilist&quot; and broke the German flank defences on the night of 26/27 March, forcing the outflanked German forces to withdraw northwards to Wadi Akarit.

In mid-April, XXX Corps attempted to attack the position head on but made little progress against determined German and Italian resistance. By that time the First Army had broken through the German line on their left in central Tunisia and the Axis forces were forced to surrender.

==Sicily==
On 10 July 1943, XXX Corps was part of the Allied invasion of Sicily. The corps (under Lieutenant General Oliver Leese) was to compose the left flank of the Eighth Army. It was reinforced with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, and the 231st Infantry Brigade of units from Malta.

XXX Corps landed near Pachino and made early gains against the Italian 206th Coastal Division and the 54th &quot;Napoli&quot; Division. By 18 July, it was halfway to Messina. Progress slowed considerably after that because Sicily&#x27;s mountainous terrain favoured well-equipped defenders (like the German forces in Group Schmalz) and they managed to move very little. The Axis began withdrawing troops from Sicily and the Germans put up a brave fighting withdrawal. By 17 August, the last German troops had crossed the straits of Messina and the Allies were in control of Sicily. XXX Corps was then pulled out of the line and sent to the United Kingdom to re-fit and re-train for Operation Overlord.

==North West Europe==

===Normandy===
In Normandy XXX Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall, again included the 50th Division which landed on Gold Beach. It quickly overwhelmed the German defenders of the 716th Infantry Division and had linked up with the I Corps by the end of D-Day. Following D-Day the corps launched Operation Perch. It made slow gains facing stiff resistance but by 10 June had linked up with US forces advancing from Omaha Beach. On 12 June, an opportunity arose. The Germans had a gap in their front lines near the Town of Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé. The 7th Armoured Division was sent to exploit the gap and head towards Villers-Bocage to outflank the German Panzer-Lehr-Division and force them to withdraw, resulting in the Battle of Villers-Bocage. This attack was thwarted by elements of the Panzer Lehr Division and the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Bucknall was heavily criticised for his decisions during the operation and battle.

XXX Corps was then involved in a battle of attrition with only minor gains being made. Up to 24 July, the front line remained relatively unchanged. The next day the Americans launched Operation Cobra, an attack on German positions on the western end of the Contentin Peninsula. They made considerable progress and the Second Army launched Operation Bluecoat to support the attack and to exploit the momentum. VIII Corps, on the right flank made considerable progress but XXX Corps was sluggish. Montgomery sacked Bucknall and replaced him with Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, a distinguished veteran of North Africa. After the sacking of Bucknall, the performance of XXX Corps improved considerably and it managed to keep up with the other British corps during the Battle for the Falaise Gap. After the German collapse, XXX Corps quickly advanced north-east and liberated Brussels and Antwerp in Belgium. There the advance was halted because of a shortage of fuel. Elements of the Guards Armoured Division and the 2nd Household Cavalry Regiment managed to secure a bridge across the Maas-Schelde canal into the Netherlands. This bridge was nicknamed Joe&#x27;s Bridge in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Joe Vandeleur of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards who captured the bridge.

===Operation Market Garden===

After the success in France and Belgium, General Montgomery commanding the 21st Army Group turned his attention to outflanking the Siegfried Line and invading the Ruhr in a pincer movement. The northern part of the pincer would be near Arnhem at the Dutch–German border. Allied troops would concentrate at this point to form the northern part of the pincer. XXX Corps, consisting of approximately 50,000 men, would advance along the main axis of the Second Army and reach Arnhem within 48 hours, and continue on to the Dutch–German border. XXX Corps was to be the GARDEN part of the operation to advance past Arnhem. This required crossing water obstacles, the last of them a road bridge at Arnhem. When the pincer closed, this would allow the British to trap the 15th Army, splitting it from the 1st Parachute Army on the way around the northern flank of the Siegfried Line.

The MARKET part of the operation was to seize the bridges up to Arnhem. Montgomery requested from General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front, to deploy the First Allied Airborne Army. The 101st Airborne Division (Major General Maxwell D. Taylor) was dropped at Eindhoven, to secure the Son and Wilhelmina Canal bridges, the 82nd Airborne Division (Brigadier General James M. Gavin), dropped at Nijmegen, to secure the Grave and Nijmegen bridges, while the British 1st Airborne Division (Major-General Roy Urquhart), dropped at Arnhem, to secure the bridgehead over the Neder Rijn. Attached to the 1st Airborne Division was the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade (Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski).
Operation Market Garden commenced at 14:00H on Sunday 17 September 1944, with the artillery preparation by 350 guns at 14:35. It was to be the most ambitious ground offensive operation by the British Army in the war so far. It was beset by problems. The ground was assessed to be too soft to accommodate the Sherman tanks of the leading Irish Guards Battle Group, forcing the entire Guards Armoured Division to stay on the single highway. As XXX Corps advanced north-east, it became obvious that the highway was prone to traffic jams and was extremely vulnerable to enemy counter-attacks.

The lead elements of XXX Corps, the Guards Armoured Division (Major-General Allan Adair) were ambushed by German anti-tank defences, causing delays to the advance. As a result, they were far short of the 82nd Airborne Division objectives, having not even reached the 101st Airborne Division by the end of the first day. On the second day of GARDEN, the Guards Armoured Division continued northwards to Eindhoven, where they met elements of the 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. They soon discovered that 101st had failed to secure the bridge at Son intact, creating more delays before XXX Corps engineers arrived to build a Bailey bridge.

On the morning of 19 September the Guards Armoured Division advanced without facing much resistance reaching the Nijmegen Bridge on schedule the same day, where they found that the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division had failed to capture the road bridge at Nijmegen, with troops only at the southern end of the bridge. XXX Corps brought up boats used by bridge engineers, allowing two companies of the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (Major Julian Cook) to cross the river to assault the bridge from the northern end. XXX Corps captured the Nijmegen bridge by running their tanks over. The Guards Armoured Division advanced and quickly established positions on the north bank to secure the bridge.

Further south, in the 101st Airborne Division sector, many units from XXX Corps had to be detached to fight off repeated attempts by the German 106th &quot;Panzerbrigade&quot; to cut the highway. The 231st Infantry Brigade (from the 50th Division) and the 4th Armoured Brigade spent most of the time during Operation Market Garden reacting to these probes by German Panther tanks and &quot;panzergrenadiers&quot;. This created traffic jams and delayed reinforcements reaching the Guards Armoured Division–particularly the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division (Major-General Ivor Thomas) and the 69th and 151st Brigades of the 50th Division, which further slowed down the XXX Corps advance.

By 21 September the Guards Armoured Division was exhausted and Horrocks also took ill, with XXX Corps periodically being commanded by its Brigadier General Staff (BGS) Brigadier Harold Pyman, for which he would be made Chief of Staff of the Second Army after the operation. They had fought continuously for five days, much of it against fierce German resistance and were unable to continue the offensive. The 43rd Division was brought up to continue and managed to defeat elements of the 10th SS Panzer Division that penetrated to Nijmegen area and advanced to the Neder Rijn and the area called &quot;the Island&quot;. There the 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment crossed the Rhine as a diversion, so that the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division could withdraw more safely but many men of the 4th Dorsets were left behind on the north bank of the Rhine when the division withdrew.

The failure of the 82nd Airborne Division to seize the Nijmegen bridge caused a long delay for the XXX Corps to arrive at the Arnhem bridge as planned. This caused the 1st Airborne Division, which was surrounded in the Battle of Arnhem and suffered many casualties, to retreat from the Arnhem bridge after the delay enabled the Germans to reinforce with armoured divisions. Most of the 1st Airborne Division was killed, surrendered or withdrew to the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade positions, which ended the offensive.

===Ardennes===
During the Battle of the Bulge, units of XXX Corps moved to secure the bridges over the Meuse. On 27 December the Corps pushed the 2nd Panzer Division out of Celles. On 31 December they captured Rochefort at the western end of the salient.

===The Rhineland Campaign===

XXX Corps was involved in the fighting that preceded Operation Plunder the Rhine crossings. Under command of the 1st Canadian Army and with additional divisions, it was responsible for the difficult advance through the Reichswald Forest that was the first phase of Operation Veritable in February 1945. The subsequent phases were renamed Operation Blockbuster. The terrain now allowed a two corps front, with XXX Corps taking the western side until meeting at Geldern with elements of the 9th US Army on 3 March. on 23rd March XXX Corps began Operation Turnscrew within the framework of Operation Plunder the Rhine Crossing at Rees.

<doc id="471487" wikidata="Q618164" url="?curid=471487" title="Cosmic distance ladder">
<text>The cosmic distance ladder (also known as the extragalactic distance scale) is the succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects. A &quot;direct&quot; distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are &quot;close enough&quot; (within about a thousand parsecs) to Earth. The techniques for determining distances to more distant objects are all based on various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known luminosity.

The ladder analogy arises because no single technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

== Direct measurement ==

At the base of the ladder are &quot;fundamental&quot; distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of the discipline of astrometry. Early fundamental distances—such as the radii of the earth, moon and sun, and the distances between them—were well estimated with very low technology by the ancient Greeks.

=== Astronomical unit ===
Direct distance measurements are based upon the astronomical unit (AU), which is defined as the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Kepler&#x27;s laws provide precise ratios of the orbit sizes of objects orbiting the Sun, but provide no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system. Radar is used to measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body. From that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes, the size of Earth&#x27;s orbit is calculated. The Earth&#x27;s orbit is known with an absolute precision of a few meters and a relative precision of a few parts in 100 billion ().

Historically, observations of Venus transits were crucial in determining the AU; in the first half of the 20th century, observations of asteroids were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using radar measurements of distances to Venus and other nearby planets and asteroids, and by tracking interplanetary spacecraft in their orbits around the Sun through the Solar System.

=== Parallax ===
== Standard candles ==
Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing this known luminosity to an object&#x27;s observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse-square law. These objects of known brightness are termed standard candles, coined by Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

The brightness of an object can be expressed in terms of its absolute magnitude. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude, the magnitude as seen by the observer (an instrument called a bolometer is used), can be measured and used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance &quot;d&quot; to the object in parsecs as follows:
formula_1
or
formula_2
where &quot;m&quot; is the apparent magnitude, and &quot;M&quot; the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.
Some means of correcting for interstellar extinction, which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is needed, especially if the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region. The difference between an object&#x27;s absolute and apparent magnitudes is called its distance modulus, and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

=== Problems ===
Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is calibration, that is the determination of exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. This includes defining the class well enough that members can be recognized, and finding enough members of that class with well-known distances to allow their true absolute magnitude to be determined with enough accuracy. The second problem lies in recognizing members of the class, and not mistakenly using a standard candle calibration on an object which does not belong to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the recurring question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness, corrected by the shape of the light curve. The basis for this closeness in brightness is discussed below; however, the possibility exists that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae. The use of Type Ia supernovae is crucial in determining the correct cosmological model. If indeed the properties of Type Ia supernovae are different at large distances, i.e. if the extrapolation of their calibration to arbitrary distances is not valid, ignoring this variation can dangerously bias the reconstruction of the cosmological parameters, in particular the reconstruction of the matter density parameter.

That this is not merely a philosophical issue can be seen from the history of distance measurements using Cepheid variables. In the 1950s, Walter Baade discovered that the nearby Cepheid variables used to calibrate the standard candle were of a different type than the ones used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The nearby Cepheid variables were population I stars with much higher metal content than the distant population II stars. As a result, the population II stars were actually much brighter than believed, and when corrected, this had the effect of doubling the estimates of distances to the globular clusters, the nearby galaxies, and the diameter of the Milky Way.

Most recently kilonova have been proposed as another type of standard candle. &quot;Since kilonovae explosions are spherical, astronomers could compare the apparent size of a supernova explosion with its actual size as seen by the gas motion, and thus measure the rate of cosmic expansion at different distances.&quot;

== Standard siren ==
Gravitational waves originating from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems, such as neutron stars or black holes, have the useful property that energy emitted as gravitational radiation comes exclusively from the orbital energy of the pair, and the resultant shrinking of their orbits is directly observable as an increase in the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. To leading order, the rate of change of frequency formula_3 is given by
formula_4
where formula_5 is the gravitational constant, formula_6 is the speed of light, and formula_7 is a single (therefore computable) number called the chirp mass of the system, a combination of the masses formula_8 of the two objects
formula_9
By observing the waveform, the chirp mass can be computed and thence the power (rate of energy emission) of the gravitational waves. Thus, such a gravitational wave source is a standard siren of known loudness.

Just as with standard candles, given the emitted and received amplitudes, the inverse-square law determines the distance to the source. There are some differences with standard candles, however. Gravitational waves are not emitted isotropically, but measuring the polarisation of the wave provides enough information to determine the angle of emission. Gravitational wave detectors also have anisotropic antenna patterns, so the position of the source on the sky relative to the detectors is needed to determine the angle of reception.

Generally, if a wave is detected by a network of three detectors at different locations, the network will measure enough information to make these corrections and obtain the distance. Also unlike standard candles, gravitational waves need no calibration against other distance measures. The measurement of distance does of course require the calibration of the gravitational wave detectors, but then the distance is fundamentally given as a multiple of the wavelength of the laser light being used in the gravitational wave interferometer.

There are other considerations that limit the accuracy of this distance, besides detector calibration. Fortunately, gravitational waves are not subject to extinction due to an intervening absorbing medium. But they &quot;are&quot; subject to gravitational lensing, in the same way as light. If a signal is strongly lensed, then it might be received as multiple events, separated in time, the analogue of multiple images of a quasar, for example. Less easy to discern and control for is the effect of weak lensing, where the signal&#x27;s path through space is affected by many small magnification and demagnification events. This will be important for signals originating at cosmological redshifts greater than 1. It is difficult for detector networks to measure the polarization of a signal accurately if the binary system is observed nearly face-on. Such signals suffer significantly larger errors in the distance measurement. Unfortunately, binaries radiate most strongly perpendicular to the orbital plane, so face-on signals are intrinsically stronger and the most commonly observed.

If the binary consists of a pair of neutron stars, their merger will be accompanied by a kilonova/hypernova explosion that may allow the position to be accurately identified by electromagnetic telescopes. In such cases, the redshift of the host galaxy allows a determination of the Hubble constant formula_10. This was the case for GW170817, which was used to make the first such measurement. Even if no electromagnetic counterpart can be identified for an ensemble of signals, it is possible to use a statistical method to infer the value of formula_10.

== Standard ruler ==

Another class of physical distance indicator is the standard ruler. In 2008, galaxy diameters have been proposed as a possible standard ruler for cosmological parameter determination. More recently the physical scale imprinted by baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the early universe has been used. 
In the early universe (before recombination) the baryons and photons scatter off each other, and form a tightly coupled fluid that can support sound waves. The waves are sourced by primordial density perturbations, and travel at speed that can be predicted from the baryon density and other cosmological parameters.

The total distance that these sound waves can travel before recombination determines a fixed scale, which simply expands with the universe after recombination. BAO therefore provide a standard ruler that can be measured in galaxy surveys from the effect of baryons on the clustering of galaxies. The method requires an extensive galaxy survey in order to make this scale visible, but has been measured with percent-level precision (see baryon acoustic oscillations). The scale does depend on cosmological parameters like the baryon and matter densities, and the number of neutrinos, so distances based on BAO are more dependent on cosmological model than those based on local measurements.

Light echos can be also used as standard rulers, although it is challenging to correctly measure the source geometry.

== Galactic distance indicators ==
With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only out to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:
* Dynamical parallax, uses orbital parameters of visual binaries to measure the mass of the system, and hence use the mass–luminosity relation to determine the luminosity
**Eclipsing binaries — In the last decade, measurement of eclipsing binaries&#x27; fundamental parameters has become possible with 8-meter class telescopes. This makes it feasible to use them as indicators of distance. Recently, they have been used to give direct distance estimates to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), Andromeda Galaxy and Triangulum Galaxy. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy which is feasible with current technology to a distance of around 3 Mpc (3 million parsecs).
* RR Lyrae variables — used for measuring distances within the galaxy and in nearby globular clusters.
* The following four indicators all use stars in the old stellar populations (Population II):
** Tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) distance indicator.
** Planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF)
** Globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF)
** Surface brightness fluctuation (SBF)
* In galactic astronomy, X-ray bursts (thermonuclear flashes on the surface of a neutron star) are used as standard candles. Observations of X-ray burst sometimes show X-ray spectra indicating radius expansion. Therefore, the X-ray flux at the peak of the burst should correspond to Eddington luminosity, which can be calculated once the mass of the neutron star is known (1.5 solar masses is a commonly used assumption). This method allows distance determination of some low-mass X-ray binaries. Low-mass X-ray binaries are very faint in the optical, making their distances extremely difficult to determine.
* Interstellar masers can be used to derive distances to galactic and some extragalactic objects that have maser emission.
* Cepheids and novae
* The Tully–Fisher relation
* The Faber–Jackson relation
* Type Ia supernovae that have a very well-determined maximum absolute magnitude as a function of the shape of their light curve and are useful in determining extragalactic distances up to a few hundred Mpc. A notable exception is SN 2003fg, the &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, a Type Ia supernova of unusual nature.
* Redshifts and Hubble&#x27;s law

=== Main sequence fitting ===
When the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the star, in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence. By measuring these properties from a star&#x27;s spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram can be determined, and thereby the star&#x27;s absolute magnitude estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound star cluster such as the Hyades, the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

== Extragalactic distance scale ==
The extragalactic distance scale is a series of techniques used today by astronomers to determine the distance of cosmological bodies beyond our own galaxy, which are not easily obtained with traditional methods. Some procedures use properties of these objects, such as stars, globular clusters, nebulae, and galaxies as a whole. Other methods are based more on the statistics and probabilities of things such as entire galaxy clusters.

=== Wilson–Bappu effect ===

Discovered in 1956 by Olin Wilson and M.K. Vainu Bappu, the Wilson–Bappu effect uses the effect known as spectroscopic parallax. Many stars have features in their spectra, such as the calcium K-line, that indicate their absolute magnitude. The distance to the star can then be calculated from its apparent magnitude using the distance modulus.

There are major limitations to this method for finding stellar distances. The calibration of the spectral line strengths has limited accuracy and it requires a correction for interstellar extinction. Though in theory this method has the ability to provide reliable distance calculations to stars up to 7 megaparsecs (Mpc), it is generally only used for stars at hundreds of kiloparsecs (kpc).

=== Classical Cepheids ===

Beyond the reach of the Wilson–Bappu effect, the next method relies on the period-luminosity relation of classical Cepheid variable stars. The following relation can be used to calculate the distance to Galactic and extragalactic classical Cepheids:

formula_12 
formula_13

Several problems complicate the use of Cepheids as standard candles and are actively debated, chief among them are: the nature and linearity of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands and the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations, and the effects of photometric contamination (blending) and a changing (typically unknown) extinction law on Cepheid distances.

These unresolved matters have resulted in cited values for the Hubble constant ranging between 60 km/s/Mpc and 80 km/s/Mpc. Resolving this discrepancy is one of the foremost problems in astronomy since some cosmological parameters of the Universe may be constrained significantly better by supplying a precise value of the Hubble constant.

Cepheid variable stars were the key instrument in Edwin Hubble&#x27;s 1923 conclusion that M31 (Andromeda) was an external galaxy, as opposed to a smaller nebula within the Milky Way. He was able to calculate the distance of M31 to 285 kpc, today&#x27;s value being 770 kpc.

As detected thus far, NGC 3370, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo, contains the farthest Cepheids yet found at a distance of 29 Mpc. Cepheid variable stars are in no way perfect distance markers: at nearby galaxies they have an error of about 7% and up to a 15% error for the most distant.

=== Supernovae ===
There are several different methods for which supernovae can be used to measure extragalactic distances.

==== Measuring a supernova&#x27;s photosphere ====
We can assume that a supernova expands in a spherically symmetric manner. If the supernova is close enough such that we can measure the angular extent, &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), of its photosphere, we can use the equation

formula_14
where &quot;ω&quot; is angular velocity, &quot;θ&quot; is angular extent. In order to get an accurate measurement, it is necessary to make two observations separated by time Δ&quot;t&quot;. Subsequently, we can use

formula_15
where d is the distance to the supernova, &quot;Vej&quot; is the supernova&#x27;s ejecta&#x27;s radial velocity (it can be assumed that &quot;Vej&quot; equals &quot;Vθ&quot; if spherically symmetric).

This method works only if the supernova is close enough to be able to measure accurately the photosphere. Similarly, the expanding shell of gas is in fact not perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody. Also interstellar extinction can hinder the accurate measurements of the photosphere. This problem is further exacerbated by core-collapse supernova. All of these factors contribute to the distance error of up to 25%.

==== Type Ia light curves ====

Type Ia supernovae are some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances. Ia&#x27;s occur when a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually it reaches its Chandrasekhar limit of formula_16.

Once reached, the star becomes unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. Because all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass, their absolute magnitudes are all the same. This makes them very useful as standard candles. All Type Ia supernovae have a standard blue and visual magnitude of

formula_17
Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was, then its distance can be calculated. It is not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude; using the multicolor light curve shape method (MLCS), the shape of the light curve (taken at any reasonable time after the initial explosion) is compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness. This method also takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas.

Similarly, the stretch method fits the particular supernovae magnitude light curves to a template light curve. This template, as opposed to being several light curves at different wavelengths (MLCS) is just a single light curve that has been stretched (or compressed) in time. By using this &quot;Stretch Factor&quot;, the peak magnitude can be determined.

Using Type Ia supernovae is one of the most accurate methods, particularly since supernova explosions can be visible at great distances (their luminosities rival that of the galaxy in which they are situated), much farther than Cepheid Variables (500 times farther). Much time has been devoted to the refining of this method. The current uncertainty approaches a mere 5%, corresponding to an uncertainty of just 0.1 magnitudes.

==== Novae in distance determinations ====

Novae can be used in much the same way as supernovae to derive extragalactic distances. There is a direct relation between a nova&#x27;s max magnitude and the time for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes. This relation is shown to be:

formula_18
Where formula_19 is the time derivative of the nova&#x27;s mag, describing the average rate of decline over the first 2 magnitudes.

After novae fade, they are about as bright as the most luminous Cepheid variable stars, therefore both these techniques have about the same max distance: ~ 20 Mpc. The error in this method produces an uncertainty in magnitude of about ±0.4

=== Globular cluster luminosity function ===

Based on the method of comparing the luminosities of globular clusters (located in galactic halos) from distant galaxies to that of the Virgo Cluster, the globular cluster luminosity function carries an uncertainty of distance of about 20% (or 0.4 magnitudes).

US astronomer William Alvin Baum first attempted to use globular clusters to measure distant elliptical galaxies. He compared the brightest globular clusters in Virgo A galaxy with those in Andromeda, assuming the luminosities of the clusters were the same in both. Knowing the distance to Andromeda, Baum has assumed a direct correlation and estimated Virgo A&#x27;s distance.

Baum used just a single globular cluster, but individual formations are often poor standard candles. Canadian astronomer René Racine assumed the use of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) would lead to a better approximation. The number of globular clusters as a function of magnitude is given by:

formula_20
where &quot;m&quot;0 is the turnover magnitude, &quot;M&quot;0 is the magnitude of the Virgo cluster, and sigma is the dispersion ~ 1.4 mag.

It is assumed that globular clusters all have roughly the same luminosities within the universe. There is no universal globular cluster luminosity function that applies to all galaxies.

=== Planetary nebula luminosity function ===

Like the GCLF method, a similar numerical analysis can be used for planetary nebulae within far off galaxies. The planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) was first proposed in the late 1970s by Holland Cole and David Jenner. They suggested that all planetary nebulae might all have similar maximum intrinsic brightness, now calculated to be M = −4.53. This would therefore make them potential standard candles for determining extragalactic distances.

Astronomer George Howard Jacoby and his colleagues later proposed that the PNLF function equaled:

formula_21
Where N(M) is number of planetary nebula, having absolute magnitude M. M* is equal to the nebula with the brightest magnitude.

=== Surface brightness fluctuation method ===
The following method deals with the overall inherent properties of galaxies. These methods, though with varying error percentages, have the ability to make distance estimates beyond 100 Mpc, though it is usually applied more locally.

The surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method takes advantage of the use of CCD cameras on telescopes. Because of spatial fluctuations in a galaxy&#x27;s surface brightness, some pixels on these cameras will pick up more stars than others. As distance increases, the picture will become increasingly smoother. Analysis of this describes a magnitude of the pixel-to-pixel variation, which is directly related to a galaxy&#x27;s distance.

=== Sigma-D relation ===

The Sigma-D relation (or Σ-D relation), used in elliptical galaxies, relates the angular diameter (D) of the galaxy to its velocity dispersion. It is important to describe exactly what D represents, in order to understand this method. It is, more precisely, the galaxy&#x27;s angular diameter out to the surface brightness level of 20.75 B-mag arcsec−2. This surface brightness is independent of the galaxy&#x27;s actual distance from us. Instead, D is inversely proportional to the galaxy&#x27;s distance, represented as d. Thus, this relation does not employ standard candles. Rather, D provides a standard ruler. This relation between D and Σ is

formula_22
where C is a constant which depends on the distance to the galaxy clusters.

This method has the potential to become one of the strongest methods of galactic distance calculators, perhaps exceeding the range of even the Tully–Fisher method. As of today, however, elliptical galaxies are not bright enough to provide a calibration for this method through the use of techniques such as Cepheids. Instead, calibration is done using more crude methods.

== Overlap and scaling ==
A succession of distance indicators, which is the distance ladder, is needed for determining distances to other galaxies. The reason is that objects bright enough to be recognized and measured at such distances are so rare that few or none are present nearby, so there are too few examples close enough with reliable trigonometric parallax to calibrate the indicator. For example, Cepheid variables, one of the best indicators for nearby spiral galaxies, cannot yet be satisfactorily calibrated by parallax alone, though the Gaia space mission can now weigh in on that specific problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that different stellar populations generally do not have all types of stars in them.

Cepheids in particular are massive stars, with short lifetimes, so they will only be found in places where stars have very recently been formed. Consequently, because elliptical galaxies usually have long ceased to have large-scale star formation, they will not have Cepheids. Instead, distance indicators whose origins are in an older stellar population (like novae and RR Lyrae variables) must be used. RR Lyrae variables are less luminous than Cepheids, and novae are unpredictable and an intensive monitoring program—and luck during that program—is needed to gather enough novae in the target galaxy for a good distance estimate.

Because the more distant steps of the cosmic distance ladder depend upon the nearer ones, the more distant steps include the effects of errors in the nearer steps, both systematic and statistical ones. The result of these propagating errors means that distances in astronomy are rarely known to the same level of precision as measurements in the other sciences, and that the precision necessarily is poorer for more distant types of object.

Another concern, especially for the very brightest standard candles, is their &quot;standardness&quot;: how homogeneous the objects are in their true absolute magnitude. For some of these different standard candles, the homogeneity is based on theories about the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, and is thus also subject to uncertainties in those aspects. For the most luminous of distance indicators, the Type Ia supernovae, this homogeneity is known to be poor. However, no other class of object is bright enough to be detected at such large distances, so the class is useful simply because there is no real alternative.

The observational result of Hubble&#x27;s law, the proportional relationship between distance and the speed with which a galaxy is moving away from us, usually referred to as redshift, is a product of the cosmic distance ladder. Edwin Hubble observed that fainter galaxies are more redshifted. Finding the value of the Hubble constant was the result of decades of work by many astronomers, both in amassing the measurements of galaxy redshifts and in calibrating the steps of the distance ladder. Hubble&#x27;s law is the primary means we have for estimating the distances of quasars and distant galaxies in which individual distance indicators cannot be seen.

<text>The Rogue River (, ) in southwestern Oregon in the United States flows about in a generally westward direction from the Cascade Range to the Pacific Ocean. Known for its salmon runs, whitewater rafting, and rugged scenery, it was one of the original eight rivers named in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Beginning near Crater Lake, which occupies the caldera left by the explosive volcanic eruption and collapse of Mount Mazama, the river flows through the geologically young High Cascades and the older Western Cascades, another volcanic province. Further west, the river passes through multiple exotic terranes of the more ancient Klamath Mountains. In the Kalmiopsis Wilderness section of the Rogue basin are some of the world&#x27;s best examples of rocks that form the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Near the mouth of the river, the only dinosaur fragments ever discovered in Oregon were found in the Otter Point Formation, along the coast of Curry County.

People have lived along the Rogue River and its tributaries for at least 8,500 years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) toward the end of the 18th century and began beaver trapping and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, the Rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.

Dam building and removal along the Rogue has generated controversy for more than a century; an early fish-blocking dam (Ament) was dynamited by vigilantes, mostly disgruntled salmon fishermen. By 2010, all of the main-stem dams downstream of a huge flood-control structure from the river mouth had been removed. Aside from dams, threats to salmon include high water temperatures. Although sometimes too warm for salmonids, the main stem Rogue is relatively clean, ranking between 85 and 97 (on a scale of 0 to 100) on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI).

Although the Rogue Valley near Medford is partly urban, the average population density of the Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity in many parts of the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.

==Course==
The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Larson Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at above sea level, the river loses more than in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific.
It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included of the Rogue, from west of Grants Pass to east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river&#x27;s total length, , about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon.

===Discharge===

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates five stream gauges along the Rogue River. They are located, from uppermost to lowermost, near Prospect, Eagle Point, Central Point, Grants Pass, and Agness. Between 1960 and 2007, the average discharge recorded by the Agness gauge at river mile (RM) 29.7 or river kilometer (RK) 47.8 was . The maximum discharge during this period was on December 23, 1964, and the minimum discharge was on July 9 and 10, 1968. This was from a drainage basin of , or about 76 percent of the entire Rogue watershed. The maximum flow occurred between December 1964 and January 1965 during the Christmas flood of 1964, which was rated by the National Weather Service as one of Oregon&#x27;s top 10 weather events of the 20th century.

==Watershed==

Draining , the Rogue River watershed covers parts of Jackson, Josephine, Curry, Douglas, and Klamath counties in southwestern Oregon and Siskiyou and Del Norte counties in northern California. The steep, rugged basin, stretching from the western flank of the Cascade Range to the northeastern flank of the Siskiyou Mountains, varies in elevation from at the summit of Mount McLoughlin in the Cascades to , where the basin meets the ocean. The basin borders the watersheds of the Williamson River, Upper Klamath Lake, and the upper Klamath River on the east; the lower Klamath, Smith, and Chetco rivers on the south; the North Umpqua, South Umpqua, Coquille, and Sixes rivers on the north, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.

In 2000, Jackson County had a population of about 181,300, most of them living in the Rogue River Valley cities of Ashland (19,500), Talent (5,600), Phoenix (4,100), Medford (63,200), Central Point (12,500), and Jacksonville (2,200). Others in Jackson County lived in the cities of Shady Cove (2,300), Eagle Point (4,800), Butte Falls (400) and Rogue River (1,800). Josephine County had a population of 75,700, including the cities of Grants Pass (23,000) and Cave Junction (1,400). Gold Beach (1,900) is the only city in Curry County (21,100) in the Rogue River basin. Only small, sparsely inhabited parts of the watershed are in Klamath and Douglas counties in Oregon and Siskiyou and Del Norte counties in California. The watershed&#x27;s average population density is about 32 people per square mile (12.4/km2).

Many overlapping entities including city, county, state, and federal governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60 percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83 percent of the basin; another 6 percent is grassland, 3 percent shrub, and only 0.2 percent wetland. Urban areas account for slightly less than 1 percent and farms for about 6 percent.

Precipitation in the Rogue basin varies greatly from place to place and season to season. At Gold Beach on the Pacific Coast it averages about a year, whereas at Ashland, which is inland, it averages about . The average annual precipitation for the entire basin is about . Most of this falls in winter and spring, and summers are dry. At high elevations in the Cascades, much of the precipitation arrives as snow and infiltrates permeable volcanic soils; snowmelt contributes to stream flows in the upper basin during the dry months. Along the Illinois River in the lower basin, most of the precipitation falls as rain on shallow soils; rapid runoff leads to high flows during winter storms and low flows during the dry summer. Average monthly temperatures for the whole basin range from about in July and August to about in December. Within the basin, local temperatures vary with elevation.

==Geology==
===High and Western Cascades===
 Arising near Crater Lake, the Rogue River flows from the geologically young High Cascades through the somewhat older Western Cascades and then through the more ancient Klamath Mountains. The High Cascades are composed of volcanic rock produced at intervals from about 7.6 million years ago through geologically recent events such as the catastrophic eruption of Mount Mazama in about 5700 BCE. The volcano hurled of ash into the air, covering much of the western U.S. and Canada with airfall deposits. The volcano&#x27;s subsequent collapse formed the caldera of Crater Lake.

Older and more deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are a range of volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered volcanic rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs ranging in age from 0 to 40 million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.

===Klamath Mountains===
Much more ancient than the upstream mountains are the exotic terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa and pushed it westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and bits of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130 million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.

Among the oldest rocks in Oregon, some of the formations in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250 million years ago. Between 165 and 170 million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19th century soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.

 In Curry County, the lower Rogue passes through the Galice Formation, metamorphosed shale, and other rocks formed when a small oceanic basin in the merging Klamath terranes was thrust over other Klamath rocks about 155 million years ago. The lowest part of the seafloor of the Josephine Basin, as this ancient sea came to be called, rests on top of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, where it is known as the Josephine ophiolite. Some of its rocks are peridotite, reddish-brown when exposed to oxygen but very dark green inside. According to geologist Ellen Morris Bishop, &quot;These odd tawny peridotites in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness are among the world’s best examples of rocks that form the mantle.&quot; Metamorphosed peridotite appears as serpentine along the west side of the Illinois River. Chemically unsuited for growing plants, widespread serpentinite in the Klamaths supports sparse vegetation in parts of the watershed. The Josephine peridotite was a source of valuable chromium ore, mined in the region between 1917 and 1960.

At the mouth of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon&#x27;s only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation. In 2018, a geologist from the University of Oregon found a toe bone of a plant-eating dinosaur near Mitchell in the east-central part of the state where the coast lay 100 million years ago. This discovery has also been billed as the first dinosaur fossil find in Oregon.

==History==
===First peoples===
Archaeologists believe that the first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating suggests that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago, and that at least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. The home villages of various groups shared many cultural elements, such as food, clothing, and shelter types. Intermarriage was common, and many people understood dialects of more than one of the three language groups spoken in the region. The Native Americans (Indians) included Tututni people near the coast and, further upstream, groups of Shasta Costa, Upper Rogue River Athabaskan tribes (Dakubetede and Tal-tvsh-dan-ni), Shasta, Takelma, and Latgawa. Houses in the villages varied somewhat, but were often about wide and long, framed with posts sunk into the ground, and covered with split sugar pine or red cedar planks. People left the villages during about half of the year to gather camas bulbs, sugar-pine bark, acorns, and berries, and hunted deer and elk to supplement their main food, salmon. The total early-1850s native population of southern Oregon, including the Umpqua, Coos, Coquille, and Chetco watersheds as well as the Rogue, is estimated to have been about 3,800. The population before the arrival of explorers and European diseases is thought to have been at least one-third larger, but &quot;there is insufficient evidence to estimate aboriginal populations prior to the time of first white contact... &quot;.

===Culture clash===
The first recorded encounter between whites and coastal southwestern Oregon Indians occurred in 1792 when British explorer George Vancouver anchored off Cape Blanco, about north of the mouth of the Rogue River, and Indians visited the ship in canoes. In 1826, Alexander Roderick McLeod of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) led an overland expedition from HBC&#x27;s regional headquarters in Fort Vancouver to as far south as the Rogue (4 miles inland) along with botanist David Douglas. 
 In 1827, an HBC expedition led by Peter Skene Ogden made the first direct contact between whites and the inland Rogue River natives when he crossed the Siskiyou Mountains to look for beaver. Friction between Indians and whites was relatively minor during these early encounters; however, in 1834, an HBC expedition led by Michel Laframboise was reported to have killed 11 Rogue River natives, and shortly thereafter a party led by an American trapper, Ewing Young, shot and killed at least two more. The name &quot;Rogue River&quot; apparently began with French fur trappers who called the river &quot;La Riviere aux Coquins&quot; because they regarded the natives as rogues (&quot;coquins&quot;). In 1835, Rogue River people killed four whites in a party of eight who were traveling from Oregon to California. Two years later, two of the survivors and others on a cattle drive organized by Young killed the first two Indians they met north of the Klamath River.

The number of whites entering the Rogue River watershed greatly increased after 1846, when a party of 15 men led by Jesse Applegate developed a southern alternative to the Oregon Trail; the new trail was used by emigrants headed for the Willamette Valley. Later called the Applegate Trail, it passed through the Rogue and Bear Creek valleys and crossed the Cascade Range between Ashland and south of Upper Klamath Lake. From 90 to 100 wagons and 450 to 500 emigrants used the new trail later in 1846, passing through Rogue Indian homelands between the headwaters of Bear Creek and the future site of Grants Pass and crossing the Rogue about downstream of it. Despite fears on both sides, violence in the watershed in the 1830s and 1840s was limited; &quot;Indians seemed interested in speeding whites on their way, and whites were happy to get through the region without being attacked.&quot;

In 1847, the Whitman massacre and the Cayuse War in what became southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers throughout the region and led to the formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians, though no whites were yet living in the Rogue River drainage. Along the Rogue, tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through the Rogue Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.

The peace did not last. Miners began prospecting for gold in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1852 at the site of what later became Jacksonville. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries on the south side of the main stem. At about the same time, more white emigrants, including women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28 donation land claims had been filed in the Rogue Valley. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with the Rogue River (1853) that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854–55, culminating in the Rogue River War of 1855–56.

Suffering from cold, hunger, and disease on the Table Rock Reservation, a group of Takelma returned to their old village at the mouth of Little Butte Creek in October 1855. After a volunteer militia attacked them, killing 23 men, women, and children, they fled downriver, attacking whites from Gold Hill to Galice Creek. Confronted by volunteers and regular army troops, the Indians at first repulsed them; however, after nearly 200 volunteers launched an all-day assault on the remaining natives, the war ended at Big Bend (at RM 35 or RK 56) on the lower river. By then, fighting had also ended near the coast, where, before retreating upstream, a separate group of natives had killed about 30 whites and burned their cabins near what later became Gold Beach.

Most of the Rogue River Indians were removed in 1856 to reservations further north. About 1,400 were sent to the Coast Reservation, later renamed the Siletz Reservation. To protect 400 natives still in danger of attack at Table Rock, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, ordered their removal, involving a forced march of 33 days, to the newly established Grande Ronde Reservation in Yamhill County, Oregon.

===Mail boats===
 After the Rogue River War, a small number of newcomers began to settle along or near the Rogue River Canyon. These pioneers, some of whom were white gold miners married to native Karok women from the Klamath River basin, established gardens and orchards, kept horses, cows, and other livestock, and received occasional shipments of goods sent by pack mule over the mountains. Until the 1890s, these settlers remained relatively isolated from the outside world. In 1883, one of the settlers, Elijah H. Price, proposed a permanent mail route by boat up the Rogue River from Ellensburg (later renamed Gold Beach) to Big Bend, about upstream. The route, Price told the government, would serve perhaps 11 families and no towns. Although the Post Office Department resisted the idea for many years, in early 1895 it agreed to a one-year trial of the water route, established a post office at Price&#x27;s log cabin at Big Bend, and named Price postmaster. Price&#x27;s job, for which he received no pay during the trial year, included running the post office and making sure that the mail boat made one round trip a week. He named the new post office &quot;Illahe&quot;. The name derives from the Chinook Jargon word &quot;ilahekh&quot;, meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;earth&quot;.

Propelled by rowing, poling, pushing, pulling, and sometimes by sail, the mail boat delivered letters and small packages, including groceries from Wedderburn, where a post office was established later in 1895. In 1897, the department established a post office near the confluence of the Rogue and the Illinois rivers, downriver from Illahe. The postmaster named the office &quot;Agnes&quot; after his daughter, but a transcription error added an extra &quot;s&quot; and the name became &quot;Agness&quot;. Upriver, a third post office, established in 1903, was named &quot;Marial&quot; after another postmaster&#x27;s daughter. Marial, at (RM) 48 (RK 77), is about upriver from Illahe and from Agness. To avoid difficult rapids, carriers delivered the mail by mule between Illahe and Marial, and after 1908 most mail traveling beyond Agness went by mule. The Illahe post office closed in 1943, and when the Marial post office closed in 1954, &quot;it was the last postal facility in the United States to still be served only by mule pack trains.&quot;

The first mail boat was an , double-ended craft made of cedar. By 1930, the mail-boat fleet consisted of three boats, equipped with 60-horsepower Model A Ford engines and designed to carry 10 passengers. By the 1960s, rudderless jetboats powered by twin or triple 280-horsepower engines, began to replace propeller-driven boats. The jetboats could safely negotiate shallow riffles, and the largest could carry nearly 50 passengers. Rogue mail-boat excursions, which had been growing more popular for several decades, began in the 1970s to include trips to as far upriver as Blossom Bar, above Agness. As of 2010, jet boats, functioning mainly as excursion craft, still deliver mail between Gold Beach and Agness. The Rogue River mail boat company is &quot;one of only two mail carriers delivering the mail by boat in the United States&quot;; the other is along the Snake River in eastern Oregon.

===Commercial fishing===
For thousands of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed they could hear the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20th century despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.

 By the 1880s, Robert Deniston Hume of Astoria had bought land on both sides of the lower Rogue River and established such a big fishing business that he became known as the Salmon King of Oregon. His fleet of gillnetting boats, controlling most of the anadromous fish population of the river, plied its lower . During his 32-year tenure, Hume&#x27;s company caught, processed, and shipped hundreds of tons of salmon from the Rogue. Upriver commercial fishermen also captured large quantities of fish. On a single day in 1913, Grants Pass crews using five drift boats equipped with gill nets caught of salmon.

In 1877, in connection with his commercial fishery, Hume built a hatchery at Ellensburg (Gold Beach), which released fish into the river. In its first year of operation, Hume collected 215,000 salmon eggs and released about 100,000 fry. After the first hatchery was destroyed by fire in 1893, Hume built a new hatchery in 1895, and in 1897 he co-operated with the United States Fish Commission in building and operating an egg-collecting station at the mouth of Elk Creek on the upper Rogue. In 1899, he built a hatchery near Wedderburn, across the river from Gold Beach, and until the time of his death in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from the Elk Creek station.

Based on variations in the size of the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.

As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) operates the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery near the base of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.

===Celebrities===
In 1926, author Zane Grey bought a miner&#x27;s cabin at Winkle Bar, near the river. He wrote Western books at this location, including his 1929 novel &quot; Rogue River Feud&quot;. Another of his books, &quot;Tales of Fresh Water Fishing&quot; (1928), included a chapter based on a drift-boat trip he took down the lower Rogue in 1925. The Trust for Public Land bought the property at Winkle Bar and transferred it in 2008 to the BLM, which made it accessible to the public.

In the 1930s and 1940s, many other celebrities, attracted by the scenery, fishing, rustic lodges, and boat trips, visited the lower Rogue. Famous visitors included actors Clark Gable, Tyrone Power and Myrna Loy, singer Bing Crosby, author William Faulkner, journalist Ernie Pyle, radio comedians Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, circus performer Emmett Kelly, and football star Norm van Brocklin. Bobby Doerr, a Hall of Fame baseball player, married a teacher from Illahe, and made his home along the Rogue. From 1940 to 1990, actress and dancer Ginger Rogers owned the Rogue River Ranch, operated for many years as a dairy farm, near Eagle Point. The historic Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater in Medford was named after her. Actress Kim Novak and her veterinarian husband bought a home and of land in 1997 near the Rogue River in Sams Valley, where they raise horses and llamas.

==Dams==
===Current dams===
Since the removal of the Gold Ray Dam in 2010, there remain two dams on the main stem of the Rogue River.

====William L. Jess Dam====

The William L. Jess Dam, a huge flood-control and hydroelectric structure, blocks the Rogue River from its mouth. Built by the USACE between 1972 and 1976, it impounds Lost Creek Lake. The dam, which is high and long, prevents salmon migration above this point. When the lake is full, it covers and has an average depth of . Ranked by storage capacity, its reservoir is the seventh-largest in Oregon.

====Prospect Nos. 1, 2, and 4 Hydroelectric Project====

The only artificial barrier on the main stem of the Rogue upstream of Lost Creek Lake is a diversion dam at Prospect at RM 172 (RK 277). The concrete dam, high and wide, impounds water from the Rogue and nearby streams and diverts it to power plants, which return the water to the river further downstream. PacifiCorp operates this system, called The Prospect Nos. 1, 2, and 4 Hydroelectric Project. Built in pieces between 1911 and 1944, it includes separate diversion dams on the Middle Fork Rogue River and Red Blanket Creek, and a water-transport system of canals, flumes, pipes, and penstocks.

===Removed dams===

Several dams along the river&#x27;s middle reaches were removed or destroyed during the first half of the 20th century.

After decades of controversy about water rights, costs, migratory fish, and environmental impacts, removal or modification of remaining middle-reach dams as well as a partly finished dam on Elk Creek, a major tributary of the Rogue, began in 2008. The de-construction projects were all meant to improve salmon runs by allowing more fish to reach suitable spawning grounds.

====Gold Ray Dam====
In 1904, brothers C.R. and Frank Ray built the Gold Ray Dam, a log structure, to generate electricity near Gold Hill. They installed a fish ladder. The California-Oregon Power Company, which later became Pacific Power, acquired the dam in 1921. Replacing the log dam in 1941 with a concrete structure high, it added a new fish ladder and a fish-counting station. The company closed the hydroelectric plant in 1972, although the fish ladder remained, and biologists from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife used the station to count migrating salmon and steelhead. Jackson County, which owned the dam, had it removed with the help of a $5 million federal grant approved in June 2009. The dam was demolished in the summer of 2010.

====Gold Hill Dam====

In 2008, the city of Gold Hill removed the last of the Gold Hill Dam, a diversion dam slightly downstream of the Gold Ray Dam. Originally built to provide power for a cement company, it was high and long. The dam and a diversion canal later delivered municipal water to the city until Gold Hill installed a pumping station to supply its water.

====Savage Rapids Dam====
 Savage Rapids Dam was upstream from Grants Pass. Built in 1921 to divert river flows for irrigation, the dam was tall and created a reservoir that seasonally extended up to upstream. Its removal began in April 2009, and was completed in October 2009. Twelve newly installed pumps provide river water to the irrigation canals serving of the Grants Pass Irrigation District (GPID).

====Ament Dam====

The Ament Dam, built in 1902 by the Golden Drift Mining Company to provide water for mining equipment, was slightly upriver of Grants Pass. After the company failed to keep promises to provide irrigation and electric power to the vicinity and because the dam was a &quot;massive fish killer&quot;, vigilantes destroyed part of the dam with dynamite in 1912. The damaged dam was completely removed before construction of the Savage Rapids Dam in 1921.

====Dam at Grants Pass====

In 1890, the Grants Pass Power Supply Company had built a log dam high, across the river near the city. Salmon could pass the dam during high water, but most were blocked: &quot;For half a mile below the dam, the river was crowded with fish throughout the summer.&quot; After a flood destroyed this dam in 1905, it was replaced by a dam that, like its predecessor, lacked a fish ladder. By 1940, the dam had deteriorated to the point that it no longer blocked migratory fish.

===Dams on tributaries===

In addition to the dams on the Rogue main stem, at one time or another &quot;several hundred dams were built on tributaries within the range of salmon migration&quot;, most of which supplied water for mining or irrigation. Before 1920, many of these dams made no provision for fish passage; public pressure as well as efforts by turn-of-the-century cannery owner R.D. Hume led to the installation of fish ladders on the most destructive dams. As of 2005, there were about 80 non-hydroelectric dams, mostly small irrigation structures, in the Rogue basin. In addition to Lost Creek Lake on the main stem, large reservoirs in the basin include Applegate Lake, Emigrant Lake, and Fish Lake.

In 2008, USACE removed part of the Elk Creek Dam and restored Elk Creek to its original channel. Construction on the dam had been halted by a court injunction in the 1980s after about of the proposed height of was reached. Further controversy delayed the notching for two decades. Elk Creek enters the Rogue River downstream from Lost Creek Lake.

==Bridges==
Among the many bridges that cross the Rogue River is the Isaac Lee Patterson Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 101 over the river at Gold Beach. Designed by Conde B. McCullough and built in 1931, it is &quot;one of the most notable bridges in the Pacific Northwest&quot;. Named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1982 by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the structure was the first in the U.S. to use the Freyssinet method of stress control in concrete bridges. It features 7 open-spandrel arch spans, 18 deck-girder approach spans, and many ornate decorative features such as Art Deco entrance pylons.
Several historic bridges cross the Rogue between Gold Hill and Grants Pass. The Gold Hill Bridge, designed by McCullough and built in 1927, is the only open-spandrel, barrel-arch bridge in Oregon. Its main arch is long. Also designed by McCullough, the Rock Point Bridge carries U.S. Route 99 and Oregon Route 234 over the river near the unincorporated community of Rock Point. The structure has a single arch. Built in 1920 for $48,400, it replaced a wooden bridge at the same site. The bridge was closed in September 2009 for repairs to its deck and railings. The project is expected to cost $3.9 million.

Caveman Bridge in Grants Pass is a , three-arch concrete structure. Designed by McCullough and built in 1931, it replaced the Robertson Bridge. The city calls the structure &quot;Caveman&quot; because the Redwood Highway (U.S. Route 199) that crosses the bridge passes near Oregon Caves National Monument, about south of Grants Pass.

Slightly downstream of Grants Pass, the Robertson Bridge, built around 1909, is a three-span, steel, through-truss structure moved downriver in 1929 to make way for the Caveman Bridge. It carries the Rogue River Loop Highway (Oregon Route 260) over the river west of the city. The bridge was named for pioneers who settled in the area in the 1870s.

==Pollution==
 To comply with section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act, the EPA or its state delegates must develop a list of the surface waters in each state that do not meet approved water-quality criteria. To meet the criteria, the DEQ and others have developed Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) limits for pollutants entering streams and other surface waters. The Oregon 303(d) list of pollutants for 2004–06 indicated that some reaches of the surface waters in the Rogue River basin did not meet the standards for temperature, bacteria, dissolved oxygen, sedimentation, pH and nuisance weeds and algae. All of the listed stream reaches were in Oregon; none in the California part of the basin was listed as impaired on that state&#x27;s 303(d) list in 2008.

The EPA approved temperature TMDLs for three Rogue River tributaries: Upper Sucker Creek in 1999, Lower Sucker Creek in 2002, and Lobster Creek in 2002. It approved temperature, sedimentation, and biological criteria TMDLs for the Applegate River basin in 2004, and temperature, sedimentation, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli (&quot;E. coli&quot;) TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed in 2007. In 1992 it had approved pH, aquatic weeds and algae, and dissolved oxygen TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed. In December 2008, DEQ developed two TMDLs for the Rogue River basin (except the tributaries with their own TMDLs); a temperature TMDL was meant to protect salmon and trout from elevated water temperatures, and a fecal contamination TMDL was intended to safeguard people using surface waters for recreation.

The DEQ has collected water-quality data in the Rogue basin since the mid-1980s and has used it to generate scores on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Of the eight Rogue basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of the Rogue basin—were poor. On the Rogue River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM 138.4 (RK 222.7) declining to 85 at RM 117.2 (RK 188.6) but improving to 97 at RM 11.0 (RK 17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state&#x27;s largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.

==Flora and fauna==
Most of the Rogue River watershed is in the Klamath Mountains ecoregion designated by the EPA, although part of the upper basin is in the Cascades ecoregion, and part of the lower basin is in the Coast Range ecoregion. Temperate coniferous forests dominate much of the basin. The upper basin, in the High Cascades and Western Cascades, is in places &quot;identified as containing extremely high species richness within many groups of plants and animals&quot;. Common tree species in the forests along the upper Rogue include incense cedar, white fir, and Shasta red fir.

 Further downstream a diverse mix of conifers, broadleaf evergreens, and deciduous trees and shrubs grow in parts of the basin. In more populated areas, orchards, cropland, and pastureland have largely replaced the original vegetation, although remnants of oak savanna, prairie vegetation, and seasonal ponds survive at Table Rocks north of Medford. Oak woodlands, grassland savanna, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir thrive in the relatively dry foothills east of Medford; areas in the foothills of the Illinois Valley support Douglas-fir, madrone, and incense cedar. Parts of the Illinois River watershed have sparse vegetation including Jeffrey pine and oak and ceanothus species that grow in serpentine soils. The Klamath-Siskiyou region of northern California and southwestern Oregon, including parts of the southwestern Rogue basin, is among the four most diverse temperate coniferous forests in the world. Considered one of the global centers of biodiversity, it contains about 3,500 different plant species. The Klamath-Siskiyou region is one of seven International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) areas of global botanical significance in North America and has been proposed as a World Heritage Site and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

The lower Rogue passes through the Southern Oregon Coast Range, where forests include Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, Port Orford cedar, and western redcedar, and at lower elevations Sitka spruce. Coastal forests extending from British Columbia in the north to Oregon (and the Rogue) in the south are &quot;some of the most productive in the world&quot;. The coastal region, where it has not been altered by humans, abounds with ferns, lichens, mosses, and herbs, as well as conifers.

The Rogue River contains &quot;extremely high-quality salmonid habitat and has one of the finest salmonid fisheries in the west. However, most stocks are less abundant than they were historically... &quot;. Salmonids found in the Rogue River downstream of Lost Creek Lake include Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. Other native species of freshwater fish found in the watershed include coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, green sturgeon, white sturgeon, Klamath smallscale sucker, speckled dace, prickly sculpin, and riffle sculpin. Nonnative species include redside shiner, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, catfish, brown bullhead, yellow perch, carp, goldfish, American shad, Umpqua pikeminnow, and species of trout. Coho salmon in the watershed belong to an Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) that was listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as a threatened species in 1997 and reaffirmed as threatened in 2005. The state of Oregon in 2005 listed Rogue spring Chinook salmon as potentially at risk.

Trees and shrubs growing in the riparian zones along the Rogue River include willows, red alder, white alder, black cottonwood, and Oregon ash. A few of the common animal and bird species seen along the river are American black bear, North American river otter, black-tailed deer, bald eagle, osprey, great blue heron, water ouzel, and Canada goose.

==Recreation==
===Boating===

&quot;Soggy Sneakers: A Paddler&#x27;s Guide to Oregon&#x27;s Rivers&quot; lists several whitewater runs of varying difficulty along the upper, middle, and lower Rogue River and its tributaries. The longest run, on the main stem of the river downstream of Grants Pass, is &quot;one of the best-known whitewater runs in the United States&quot;. Popular among kayakers and rafters, the run consists of class 3+ rapids separated by more gentle stretches and deep pools. Its entire length is classified Wild and Scenic.

The Wild section of the lower Rogue River runs for between Grave Creek and Watson Creek. To protect the river from overuse, a maximum of 120 commercial and noncommercial users a day are allowed to run this section. To enter it, boaters must obtain a special-use permit allocated through a random-selection process and pick it up at the Smullin Visitor Center, about west of Interstate 5 on the Merlin–Galice Road, at the Rand Ranger Station downstream of Galice. Other sections of the river are open to jetboats. A Gold Beach company offers commercial jetboat trips of up to round-trip on the lower Rogue River. Another company offers jetboat excursions on the Hellgate section of the river below Grants Pass.

===Hiking===
The Upper Rogue River Trail, a National Recreation Trail, closely follows the river for about from its headwaters at the edge of Crater Lake National Park to the boundary of the Rogue River National Forest at the mountain community of Prospect. Highlights along the trail include a river canyon cut through pumice deposited by the explosion of Mount Mazama about 8,000 years ago; the Rogue Gorge, lined with black lava, and Natural Bridge, where the river flows through a lava tube. Between Farewell Bend and Natural Bridge, the trail passes through the Union Creek Historic District, a site with early 20th-century resort buildings and a former ranger station that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Lower Rogue River Trail, a National Recreation Trail of , runs parallel to the river from Grave Creek to Illahe, in the Wild Rogue Wilderness, northwest of Grants Pass. The roadless area through which the trail runs is managed by the Siskiyou National Forest and the Medford District of the federal Bureau of Land Management and covers including of designated federal wilderness. Backpackers use the trail for multiple-day trips, while day hikers take shorter trips. In addition to scenery and wildlife, features include views of rapids and &quot;frantic boaters&quot;, lodges at Illahe, Clay Hill Rapids, Paradise Creek, and Marial, and the Rogue River Ranch and museum. Hikers can take jet boats from Gold Beach to some of the lodges between May and November. The trail connects to many shorter side trails as well as to the Illinois River Trail south of Agness. Hikers can also take trips along the Rogue that combine backpacking and rafting.

Rogue River Trail 1168 continues west along the north side of the river from Agness to the Morey Meadow Trailhead. Forest Road 3533 provides a hiking route between the trailhead and the Lobster Creek Bridge, further west. The Rogue River Walk is about a trail along the south side of the river continues west to a trailhead about east of Gold Beach.

===Fishing===
Sport fishing on the Rogue River varies greatly depending on the location. In many places, fishing is good from stream banks and gravel bars, and much of the river is also fished from boats. Upstream of Lost Creek Lake, the main stem, sometimes called the North Fork, supports varieties of trout. Between Lost Creek Lake and Grants Pass there are major fisheries for spring and fall Chinook salmon, and Coho salmon from hatcheries, summer and winter steelhead, and large resident rainbow trout. The river between Grants Pass and Grave Creek has productive runs of summer and winter steelhead and Chinook, as well as good places to fish for trout. From Grave Creek to Foster Bar, all but the lower of which is closed to jetboats, anglers fish for summer and winter steelhead, spring and fall Chinook, and Coho. Near Agness, the river produces large catches of immature steelhead known as &quot;half-pounders&quot; that return from the ocean to the river in August in large schools. The lower river has spring and fall Chinook, as well as perch, lingcod, and crab near the ocean.

===Parks===
 Parks along the Rogue River, which begins in the northwest corner of Crater Lake National Park, include Prospect State Scenic Viewpoint, a forested area south of Prospect with a hiking trail leading to waterfalls and the Rogue River. The Joseph H. Stewart State Recreation Area has campsites overlooking Lost Creek Lake. Casey State Recreation Site offers boating, fishing, and picnic areas along the river northeast of Medford. TouVelle State Recreation Site is a day-use park along the river at the base of Table Rocks and adjacent to the Denman Wildlife Area, about north of Medford. Valley of the Rogue State Park, east of Grants Pass, is built around of river shoreline.

Between Grants Pass and the Hellgate Recreation Area, Josephine County manages two parks, Tom Pearce and Schroeder, along the river. Hellgate, long, begins at the confluence of the Rogue and Applegate rivers about west of Grants Pass. This stretch of the Rogue, featuring class I and II rapids, 11 access points for boats, 4 parks and campgrounds managed by Josephine County, ends at Grave Creek, where the Wild Rogue Wilderness begins. Indian Mary Park, part of the Josephine County park system, has tent sites, yurts, and spaces for camping vehicles on along the Merlin–Galice road at Merlin. The other three Josephine County parks in the Hellgate Recreation Area are Whitehorse, across from the mouth of the Applegate River; Griffin, slightly downstream of Whitehorse, and Almeda, downstream of Indian Mary.

<text>The Rogue River is a river in the U.S. state of Michigan, running through Kent and Newaygo counties and through the Rogue River State Game Area. It is long and has a drainage basin of .

Its headwaters are a series of ditches that drain the old Rice Lake bed near Grant for agricultural purposes. In this area the stream has been dredged and straightened leaving limited fish habitat. The river joins the Grand River southeast of Belmont in Plainfield Township. The Blythefield Country Club is now situated on a bluff just northeast of where the Rogue flows into the Grand.

Originally named &quot;Rouge River&quot;, the river&#x27;s appellation was altered in the 19th century due to the printing error of a Wisconsin mapmaker.
As a frontier waterway, the historic Rogue River was of major importance to local tribes and traders. During the lumber era in the latter 19th century its waters floated timber to the mills of the Grand River valley, and the riverboat Algoma plied its way northward along Rogue giving its name to the Kent county township of Algoma.

Rogue River is designated as &quot;Country Scenic&quot; under Michigan&#x27;s Natural Rivers Act. It is popular with trout fishers and local youth who have floated the river by innertube since the mid-20th century. It is intersected in parts by the White Pine Trail. It varies from wide in the upper sections to wide near its end and is deep. There are &quot;holes&quot; in the river up to in depth.

The Rockford Dam restrains the Rogue in the city of Rockford.

In July 2010, the Rogue River was designated a Trout Unlimited Home River. This provides funding for habitat restoration and land use management planning.

<text>Eorcenberht of Kent (also Ærconberht, Earconberht, or Earconbert) (died 14 July 664) was king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent from 640 until his death, succeeding his father Eadbald.

The Kentish Royal Legend (also known as the Mildrith legend) suggests that he was the younger son of Eadbald and Emma of Austrasia, and that his older brother Eormenred was deliberately passed over, although another possibility is that they ruled jointly.

According to Bede (&quot;HE&quot; III.8), Eorcenberht was the first king in Britain to command that pagan &quot;idols&quot; (cult images) be destroyed and that Lent be observed, marking a key point in the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England. It has been suggested that these orders may have been officially committed to writing, in the tradition of Kentish law-codes initiated by Æthelberht, but no such text survives.

After the death of Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, Eorcenberht appointed the first Saxon archbishop, Deusdedit, in 655.

Eorcenberht married Seaxburh of Ely, daughter of king Anna of East Anglia. They had two sons, Ecgberht and Hlothhere, who each consecutively became king of Kent, and two daughters who both were eventually canonized: Saint Eorcengota became a nun at Faremoutiers Abbey on the continent, and Saint Ermenilda became abbess at Ely.

Eorcenberht was probably buried alongside his parents in the Church of St Mary, which his father had built in the precincts of the monastery of St Peter and St Paul in Canterbury, a church later incorporated within the Norman edifice of St Augustine&#x27;s. At that time, his relics were translated for reburial in the south transept ca. A.D. 1087.

<text>Quetzal is a standardised file format for the saved state of Z-machine games, invented by Martin Frost. Prior to the introduction of Quetzal, each Z-machine interpreter saved games in its own format; Quetzal enabled players to save a game using one interpreter and restore it with another. Use of the format is strongly recommended in Graham Nelson&#x27;s Z-machine standards document, but not obligatory. Most modern Z-machine interpreters have the ability to save Quetzal files.

The files are IFF files with a FORM of &quot;IFZS&quot; (presumably standing for &quot;Interactive Fiction Z-machine Save&quot;), although the saved files are commonly given an extension of &quot;.sav&quot;: less commonly sighted are &quot;quz&quot; and &quot;qtz&quot;. Despite the reference to the Z-machine in the FORM code, the format has proved flexible enough to be adapted for at least one alternative architecture, Glulx.

The magic-number reading of the files are often shown as:

A backronym for the format is &quot;Quetzal Unifies Efficiently The Z-Machine Archive Language&quot;.

Version 1.3b, which was widely available, contained a bug later corrected in version 1.4: after a save instruction, the Z-machine requires that a success code is saved in a particular place (which differs depending on the version). Versions of the Quetzal standard before 1.4 have reference only to the instruction &quot;after&quot; the save, which complicates finding the correct place to put the success code.

<text>Xenophon Euthymiou Zolotas (; 26 April 1904 – 10 June 2004) was a Greek economist and served as an interim non-party Prime Minister of Greece.

==Life and career==
Xenophon Zolótas was born in Athens in 1904. His father, Efthymios Zolotas, was a renowned jeweler and goldsmith in Athens. He studied law at the University of Athens for two years (1920-1922). Then, he left to study Economics in Leipzig. In May 1924 he became a Doctor of Law from the University of Athens with honors, and in 1926 he became a Doctor of Economics from the University of Leipzig, also with Honors. He then left for Paris to study French literature. In 1928, he was appointed professor at the University of Thessaloniki and then professor at the University of Athens in 1930. In 1955, he became Governor of the Bank of Greece, a position he held until 1981, at the except for the years from 1967 to 1974, during the period of the dictatorship, during which he resigned. In 1958, he married Kallirhoe Ritsou, nicknamed &quot;Lola&quot;.

As a member of the board of directors of UNRRA in 1946, he held important positions within the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations between 1946 and 1981. He is the author of numerous works on the Greek and international economies. He was considered a moderate, a champion of fiscal conservatism and monetary stability. On November 23, 1989, when the result of the legislative elections showed no majority, neither in favor of PASOK of Andréas Papandreou, nor in favor of the New Democracy party of Konstantínos Mitsotákis, Zolótas, then aged 85, accepted the post of interim prime minister until a new election is organized. He resigned after the April 1990 elections resulted in Mitsotakis winning by a narrow margin. A true workaholic, a keen swimmer even in winter, he made it a point of honor to swim every morning, even though he was in his nineties. On October 2, 1959, at an IBRD meeting in New York, he delivered, in English, a speech that remained famous, containing almost only words of Greek etymology1.

==Speeches==
Two of his speeches in English at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are considered to be historic and notable because they contained mainly terms of Greek origin.

<text>Slam Dunk (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Takehiko Inoue. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from October 1990 to June 1996, with the chapters collected into 31 volumes. The story follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, a brash and impulsive high school student who joins a basketball team at Shōhoku High School, located in the Shōnan area of Japan.

The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Toei Animation which aired from October 1993 to March 1996. The series has been broadcast worldwide, gaining popularity especially in Japan, Europe, and several other Asian countries. In December 2022, an anime feature film titled &quot;The First Slam Dunk&quot; was released in Japan.

&quot;Slam Dunk&quot; has 185 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. In 1994, it received the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category. In Japan, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; has been regarded as one of the greatest sports manga series of all time and has been cited as a contributor in popularizing basketball among Japanese youth during the 1990s. In 2010, Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in Japan.

==Plot==
Hanamichi Sakuragi is a high school delinquent and gang leader. He is very unpopular among girls, having been rejected fifty times. In his first year at Shohoku High School, Sakuragi meets Haruko Akagi, the girl of his dreams, and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or frightened of him like other girls. Haruko recognizes Sakuragi&#x27;s athleticism and introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team. Sakuragi is reluctant to play basketball due to his inexperience with sports and his belief that basketball is a game for losers. This belief came about because the most recent girl to reject him had favored a basketball player. Despite his immaturity and temper, he joins the team to impress Haruko, and proves to be a natural athlete.

Sakuragi later develops a genuine love for the sport despite initially playing because of his crush. Around this time, the star rookie and &quot;girl magnet&quot; Kaede Rukawa joins the team. Sakuragi views him as a bitter rival in basketball and romance, as Haruko has an unrequited crush on Rukawa. Shortly after, two additional members rejoin the team: Hisashi Mitsui, a skilled three-point shooter and ex–junior high school MVP; and Ryota Miyagi, a short but fast point guard. The four players work together to fulfill team captain Takenori Akagi&#x27;s dream of winning the national championship. After defeating one of the powerhouse teams at the national high school championship, the misfits gain publicity, and the once little-known Shohoku basketball team becomes an all-star contender in Japan.

==Production==

Takehiko Inoue was inspired to create &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; from his love of basketball, which he has had since high school. Before starting &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, he created a one-shot manga titled , which was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump Summer Special&quot; in 1990. The one-shot featured an early prototype of Hanamichi Sakuragi and Haruko Akagi, with a story and character dynamics that laid the groundwork for &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;. After he began working on the series, Inoue was surprised to receive letters from readers who had begun playing the sport due to his manga. His editor told him &quot;basketball was a taboo in this world.&quot; Due to these letters, Inoue decided he wanted to draw better basketball games in the series. With the series, the author wanted to demonstrate the feelings and thoughts that some athletes might have when they win, lose or improve at their sport. When he began work on &quot;Vagabond&quot;, Inoue noted that his work on &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; had a simpler perspective on life as he focused more on victories and success.

With the series, Inoue wanted readers to feel achievements and love for the sport. Thinking that his success as a manga artist was largely due to basketball, Inoue organized a &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; scholarship for Japanese students as he wanted to give back to the sport by increasing its popularity in Japan. However, when asked about the response from readers to basketball, Inoue commented that although &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; is technically a basketball manga, its story could have been told with other sports such as football. He added that the manga&#x27;s artwork was more &quot;mangalike&quot; compared to his newer works such as &quot;Real&quot;. His experiences with basketball also influenced the story of &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;. As a youth, Inoue began playing basketball to become popular with girls, but later developed an interest in the sport itself. This experience is mirrored in the character Hanamichi Sakuragi, who began playing basketball to impress a girl, only to later grow truly fond of the game. Inoue attended the NBA Finals in the United States and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as &quot;research&quot; for the manga.

====Critical reception====
Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that &quot;With solid characters, eye-popping action, and a classic underdog story, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; is what all manga series (and basketball players) should aspire to be: the complete package.&quot; Based on the first volume however, his colleague Carl Kimlinger said it came off as more of a romantic comedy than a sports manga as it focused on establishing the cast. Santos opined that its the stuff that happens off the court that really makes up the manga&#x27;s heart and soul as each character has a story to tell and a goal to reach, with the court simply providing a stage for them to &quot;act out these universal struggles.&quot; Similarly, Kris Kosaka of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; is not your typical sports story dominated by on-the-court heroics, but Inoue&#x27;s love of basketball is evident on every page.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Ben Sin wrote that there are many reasons why &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; is so beloved, including a hilarious rivalry between the main character and his teammate, a handsome star player with a large female fanbase, and &quot;many other characters and subplots which have since become a crucial part of manga lore.&quot; Sin also proclaimed Inoue to have the greatest mix of serious and goofy toned artwork in the history of comics, &quot;Inoue can draw a stunningly detailed and emotional portrait of a human being in one panel and then do a 180 on that character&#x27;s facial features the next.&quot; Kimlinger called Sakuragi an &quot;inspired choice&quot; for a lead character as he is a thug with a hair-trigger temper and all the wrong motivations, but said he does the &quot;seemingly impossible&quot; and balances likeability and extreme hubris thanks to humorous scenes. Santos wrote that while Sakuragi may not have the &quot;mind-blowing superhuman skills&quot; we normally associate with protagonists, watching him grow into a sportsman and decent human being is just as exciting. Despite having some &quot;school-punk&quot; character designs that are generally considered comedic nowadays, Santos called the art solid for its visual flow and sense of motion.

===Anime===
The anime adaptation has also been very popular in Japan. In TV Asahi&#x27;s 2005 Top 100 Anime survey of multiple age groups, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; ranked as the eighth most popular anime. In another poll from TV Asahi but developed by a website, the series ranked tenth. The home video release of the anime also had good sales, having appeared on Oricon&#x27;s Japanese Animation DVD and Blu-ray rankings.

The anime films performed well at the box office. The first three films released between 1994 and 1995 grossed , and in Japan, respectively, for a combined () grossed in Japan by 1995. &quot;The First Slam Dunk&quot;, released in 2022, grossed over worldwide , becoming one of the top ten highest-grossing anime films of all time.

==Legacy and impact==

&quot;Slam Dunk&quot; is often considered as one of the most influential manga series in Japan and one of the greatest sports manga series of all-time. Its success is cited as a cause for the increased popularity of basketball among the Japanese youth during the 1990s. Alex Wong of Yahoo! Sports wrote that the work &quot;inspired an entire generation of basketball players in Japan.&quot; In a dissertation, PhD student Dexter Thomas of Cornell University stated &quot;The first wave of basketball in Japan was pushed forward by &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;.&quot; Professional basketball players Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe have cited &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; as inspiring them. When he became a naturalized Japanese citizen, J. R. Sakuragi partially took his surname from the Hanamichi Sakuragi character.

Azusa Takahashi of the Japanese website &quot;Real Sound&quot; wrote that the appeal of &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; and the impact it had on the popularity of the sport is rooted in how realistic it is. It not only has flashy game scenes, but also includes scenes of steady practice. The &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; Scholarship program was created in 2006 by Inoue and Shueisha. The winning 17- to 18-year-old recipient receives a fully paid academic and athletic scholarship to a university-preparatory school in America if they pass the school&#x27;s admission interview. Past recipients of the scholarship include Narito Namizato and Daichi Taniguchi. In 2010, Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in Japan and the scholarship program. According to Wong, as of 2019, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; &quot;has never crossed into the mainstream in North America&quot;, and Viz editor Michael Montesa stated that in general manga related to sports have not sold as well in the United States.

The Kamakurakōkōmae No. 1 railroad crossing on the Enoshima Electric Railway has become a popular tourist attraction, or , for fans of &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; due to being depicted in the opening credits of the manga&#x27;s anime adaptation. The resulting overtourism has caused the local government to assign security guards to the location in order to curb troublesome behavior. Many of the visitors are from foreign countries such as China and South Korea. In Taiwan, a replica of the crossing was created in the town of Taimali.

<text>Glulx is a 32-bit portable virtual machine intended for writing and playing interactive fiction. It was designed by Andrew Plotkin to relieve some of the restrictions in the venerable Z-machine format. For example, because the Z-machine uses 16-bit integers its RAM is limited to 64KB, while Glulx natively supports 32-bit integers and has a 32-bit address space, allowing gigabytes of memory. Glulx programs typically use the Glk API for input and output. In recent years Glulx has overtaken the Z-machine in terms of published works in each format.

==Compilers and interpreters==
The Inform compiler, starting with version 6.30, can produce either Z-machine or Glulx story files. A Spanish interactive fiction development system called Superglús also uses Glulx.

The reference interpreter is Andrew Plotkin&#x27;s Glulxe, but the Git interpreter is often used as it is somewhat faster. There is also a JavaScript interpreter called Quixe.

==File and MIME types==
The MIME type for Glulx is &quot;application/x-glulx&quot;.
Glulx files have the file extension .ulx, but they are commonly archived in Blorb packages. For Blorb packages containing a Glulx work, accepted file extensions are .gblorb, .glb, .blorb and .blb. The former two extensions are intended to make it easy for interpreters to figure out which type of game is inside the Blorb file.

<text>The D River is a river in Lincoln City, Oregon, United States. The once-nameless river was at one time the &quot;shortest river in the world&quot; in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; at .

==World record dispute==

The world&#x27;s shortest title was lost in 1989 when Guinness named the Roe River in Montana as the world&#x27;s shortest. Attempting to reclaim the title, the people of Lincoln City submitted a new measurement to Guinness of about marked at &quot;extreme high tide&quot;. At that time, Lincoln City&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce described the Roe as a &quot;drainage ditch surveyed for a school project&quot;. Montana supporters shot back that the D was merely an &quot;ocean water backup,&quot; pointed out that there was an alternative fork to the Roe which was only long, and suggested that a new survey be conducted. Guinness apparently never ruled on the dispute, leaving the claim by the Roe to stand, but instead, starting in 2006, chose to no longer list the shortest river, possibly because of this ongoing dispute.

==Geography==
The D River flows from Devils Lake, under U.S. Route 101, and into the Pacific Ocean, entirely within the city limits of Lincoln City. The D River State Recreation Site off Highway 101 is home to two of the world&#x27;s largest kite festivals in the summer and fall.

This area was originally settled as the town of Delake, which was later incorporated with other nearby towns to form Lincoln City in 1965. The river had been known by several names, including simply &quot;the outlet&quot;, and earned its short name in a contest.

<doc id="471531" wikidata="Q446384" url="?curid=471531" title="Equalization payments">
<text>Equalization payments are cash payments made in some federal systems of government from the federal government to subnational governments with the objective of offsetting differences in available revenue or in the cost of providing services. Many federations use fiscal equalisation to reduce the inequalities in the fiscal capacities of sub-national governments arising from the differences in their geography, demography, natural endowments and economies. The level of equalisation sought can vary, however.

The payments are generally calculated based on the magnitude of the subnational &quot;fiscal gap&quot;: essentially the difference between fiscal need and fiscal capacity. Fiscal capacity and fiscal need are not equivalent to measures of fiscal revenue and expenditure, as making them so would induce perverse incentives to subnational governments to reduce fiscal effort.

==Australia==

Australia introduced a formal system of horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) in 1933 to compensate states/territories which have a lower capacity to raise revenue. The objective is full equalisation which means that, after HFE, each of the six states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory would have the capacity to provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard, if each state/territory made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency.

Currently the funds distributed to achieve HFE are the revenues raised from the Goods and Services Tax (GST), currently about AUD 50 bn a year. The distribution of GST required to achieve HFE is decided by the Federal Treasurer each year, on the basis of advice provided by the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC).

Achieving HFE does not mean that the states are directed how to raise revenue or how to spend their funds. GST revenue grants from the Commonwealth are unencumbered and available for any purpose. Accordingly, HFE equalises fiscal capacity, not fiscal policies which remain for the states to decide for themselves. It does not result in the same level of services or taxes in all states, direct that the states must achieve any specified level of service in any area, nor impose actual budget outcomes in accordance with the commission&#x27;s calculations.

==Belgium==
The only mechanism designed to reduce fiscal disparities between the federated entities in Belgium is a program called the National Solidarity Intervention ( (NSB); (ISN)). Under the program, regions in which the average per capita yield of personal income tax falls below the national average are entitled to an unconditional transfer from the federal government.

The amount paid to each region reflects the gap in the yield of personal income tax in the region in relation to the national average, weighted by an indexing factor and a factor pertaining to the amounts received by beneficiaries when the system was introduced. Their inferior fiscal capacity causes the Brussels and Walloon regions to be recipients of NSB/ISN transfers. The region of Flanders does not receive funding under the program, as its fiscal capacity lies above the national average.

==Canada==

In Canada, the Government of Canada makes payments to less wealthy Canadian provinces to equalize the provinces&#x27; &quot;fiscal capacity&quot;—their ability to generate tax revenues. In 2009–2010, six provinces received a total of in equalization payments from the federal government.
Until the 2009-2010 fiscal year, Ontario was the only province to have never received equalization payments.

Canada&#x27;s territories are not included in the equalization program - the federal government addresses territorial fiscal needs through the Territorial Formula Financing (TFF) program.

Equalization payments are based on a formula that calculates the difference between the per capita revenue yield that a particular province would obtain using average tax rates and the national average per capita revenue yield at average tax rates. The current formula considers five major revenue sources (see below). The objective of the program is to ensure that all provinces have access to per capita revenues equal to the potential average of all ten provinces. The formula is based solely on revenues and does not consider the cost of providing services or the expenditure need of the provinces.

Equalization payments do not, technically, involve wealthy provinces making payments to poor provinces, although in practice this is what happens, via the federal treasury. As an example, a wealthy citizen in New Brunswick, a so-called &quot;have not&quot; province, pays more into equalization than a poorer citizen in Alberta, a so-called &quot;have&quot; province. However, because of Alberta&#x27;s greater wealth, the citizens of Alberta as a whole are net contributors to Equalization, while the citizens of New Brunswick are net receivers of Equalization payments.

Equalization payments are one example of what are often collectively referred to in Canada as &quot;transfer payments&quot;, a term used in other jurisdictions to refer to cash payments to individuals (see Canadian Transfer Payments). In fact, there are four types of federal transfers to provinces and territories: the Canada Health Transfer (CHT), the Canada Social Transfer (CST), Equalization, and Territorial Formula Financing (TFF). Moreover, the federal government has entered into particular arrangements with certain provinces – Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, in particular – under which offset payments are made to the governments of these provinces for the development of offshore oil and gas reserves.

The money the provinces receive through equalization can be spent in any way the provincial government desires. The payments help guarantee &quot;reasonably comparable levels&quot; of health care, education, and welfare in all the provinces. The definition of &quot;reasonably comparable levels&quot;, however, has been the subject of considerable debate.

In 2009–2010, the total amount of the program was roughly billion.

Recent negotiations surrounding the renewal of the program have created considerable tension among provinces. Due to the zero-sum nature of the formula, increases in entitlements for some provinces necessarily lead to decreases for others.

==France==

Article 72-2 of the French constitution (amended 28 March 2003) created the obligation of the state to promote equality between regional bodies (regions and municipalities). That is achieved by direct tax collection by local government (Taxe professionelle) and grants from central government. Direct financing by the state amounted to 28% of revenues in 2011, devolved tax revenues account for 60% of revenues, and debt accounted for the remainder.

==Germany==

According to Section 8 of the Weimar Constitution, taxation became a matter of the federal government in 1919 and the states lost their ability to generate income. Thus, the state tax law of 1920 supplied for equalization payments among the states which ensured that no state would have less than 80% of the average state tax revenue.
Sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany supply for the distribution of tax revenues (horizontal and vertical equalization). This includes reducing the revenues of richer states in favour of the poorer ones. In 2015 this amounted to the re-distribution of 9.594 billion Euros from the states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Hamburg to all the other states.

==Switzerland==
The first elements of an equalization system in Switzerland were introduced in 1938 in the form of conditional grants, which varied according to the tax capacity of the cantons. In 1958, a constitutional article gave the federal government the authority to equalize fiscal disparities. Christopher Hengan-Braun, a Swiss economist, was the main source of guidance in 1958 for the federal government to help balance Switzerland&#x27;s fiscal disparities.

<text>The Territory of Missouri was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from June 4, 1812, until August 10, 1821. In 1819, the Territory of Arkansas was created from a portion of its southern area. In 1821, a southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Missouri, and the rest became unorganized territory for several years.

==History==
The Missouri Territory was originally known as the larger Louisiana Territory since 1804 (encompassing most of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from the French Empire) and was renamed by the U.S. Congress on June 4, 1812, to avoid confusion with the new 18th state of Louisiana (further to the south on the lower Mississippi River with its river port city of New Orleans), which had been admitted to the Union on April 30, 1812.

On October 1, 1812, newly appointed fourth Territorial Governor William Clark (1770–1838, served 1813–1820), organized the five administrative districts of the former Louisiana Territory into the first five counties of the then new Missouri Territory.

The Anglo-American Convention of 1818 established the northern boundary of the six years old Missouri Territory with the adjacent British North America (future Dominion of Canada) territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land at the 49th parallel north of latitude. This gave the Missouri Territory the Red River Valley (Red River of the North), south of the 49th parallel and gave to Rupert&#x27;s Land that slice of upper Missouri River Valley north of the 49th parallel. The Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States, established the southern and western boundaries of the old Louisiana Purchase territory of 1803, with the Royal Spanish territories of Spanish Texas and Santa Fe de Nuevo México. As a result of the protracted negotiations, the United States surrendered a significant portion of the Missouri Territory claimed in the southwest to Spain in exchange for the peninsula of Spanish Florida further east. The Convention of 1818 and the subsequent Adams–Onís Treaty the following year, would be the last significant losses of United States claimed territories from the continental contiguous United States, although the cession of lands north of the 49th parallel would turn out to be the only &quot;permanent&quot; cession of U.S. territory (the territories ceded to the Kingdom of Spain in 1819 would be re-taken by the U.S. by force, following the Annexation of Texas Republic (1845) and the Mexican–American War, (1846–1848), along with the Mexican Cession of territories further west of 1849.

On March 2, 1819, all of the Missouri Territory directly south of the parallel 36°30&#x27; north, except the so-called Missouri Bootheel between the Mississippi River and the Saint Francis River north of the 36th parallel north, was designated the new federal Territory of Arkansaw. (The spelling of Arkansaw would be changed a few years later, although the proper pronunciation of the name would be debated until 1881). The southeastern portion of the remaining Missouri Territory was admitted to the Union as the 21st State of Missouri on August 10, 1821.

St. Louis on the west bank of the Mississippi River was the capital of the Missouri Territory.

The remaining portion of the territory to the north, northwest, west and southwest, consisting of the present states of Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, most of Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, and parts of Colorado, Minnesota and New Mexico, effectively became reverted to the status of unorganized territory after 1821, when Missouri became the 21st state. Thirteen years later in 1834, the portion in the north and east of the upper Missouri River was attached to the Michigan Territory around the Great Lakes. Over time, various federal territories in the West were created in whole or in part from its remaining area of unorganized status, as follows:

Indian Territory (1834), added with future Oklahoma (1890),
Iowa (1838), Minnesota (1849), Kansas and Nebraska (both 1854), Colorado and Dakota (both 1861), Idaho (1863), Montana (1864), and Wyoming (1868).

In the 1820 United States census, 15 counties in the old Missouri Territory reported the following population counts:

<text>Ecgberht I (also spelled Egbert) (died 4 July 673) was a king of Kent (664-673), succeeding his father Eorcenberht.

He may have still been a child when he became king following his father&#x27;s death on 14 July 664, because his mother Seaxburh was recorded as having been regent.

Ecgberht&#x27;s court seems to have had many diplomatic and ecclesiastic contacts. He hosted Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop, and provided escorts to Archbishop Theodore and Abbot Adrian of Canterbury for their travels in Gaul.

The various versions of the Kentish Royal Legend state that, spurred on by his adviser Thunor, he had his cousins Æthelred and Æthelberht (sons of his uncle Eormenred) killed, and so had to pay Weregild to their sister Domne Eafe, enabling her to build a Monastery at Thanet; this may reflect a dynastic struggle that ended in the success of Eorcenberht&#x27;s line. The two murdered princes were later venerated as saints at Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire.

A charter records Ecgberht&#x27;s patronage of the monastery at Chertsey Abbey in Surrey.

Ecgberht was succeeded by his brother Hlothhere, who was in turn succeeded by Ecgberht&#x27;s sons, Eadric and still later Wihtred.

<doc id="471544" wikidata="Q3429263" url="?curid=471544" title="Blade (1998 film)">
<text>Blade is a 1998 American superhero film directed by Stephen Norrington and written by David S. Goyer. Based on the Marvel Comics character Blade, it is the first installment of the &quot;Blade&quot; franchise. The film stars Wesley Snipes as the titular character with Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson and N&#x27;Bushe Wright in supporting roles. Blade is a Dhampir, a human with vampire strengths but not their weaknesses, who fights against vampires.

&quot;Blade&quot; was released in the United States on August 21, 1998, and was a commercial success, grossing $70 million at the U.S. box office, and $131.2 million worldwide. Despite mixed reviews from film critics, the film received a positive reception from audiences and has since garnered a cult following. It is also hailed as one of Snipes&#x27;s signature roles.

&quot;Blade&quot; was noted as a dark superhero film for its time, as well as being Marvel&#x27;s first successful film. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002) and &quot;&quot; (2004), both written by Goyer, who also directed the latter. In 2024, Snipes reprised his role as Blade in the film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1967, a pregnant woman is attacked by a vampire, causing her to go into premature labor. Doctors are able to save her baby, but the woman dies.

Thirty years later, the child has become the vampire hunter Blade, who is known as the daywalker, a human-vampire hybrid that possesses the supernatural abilities of the vampires without any of their weaknesses, except for the requirement to consume human blood. Blade raids a rave club in Los Angeles owned by the vampire Deacon Frost. Police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he kills Dr. Curtis Webb and feeds on hematologist Karen Jenson, and escapes. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend Abraham Whistler. Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight, silver, and garlic. As Karen is now &quot;marked&quot; by the bite of a vampire, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city.

At a meeting of the council of pure-blood vampire elders, Frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. As Frost and his kind are not natural-born vampires, they are considered socially inferior. Meanwhile, returning to her apartment, Karen is attacked by police officer Krieger, who is a familiar, a human loyal to vampires. Blade subdues Krieger and uses information from him to locate an archive that contains pages from the &quot;vampire bible&quot;.

Krieger informs Frost of what happened, and Frost kills Krieger. Frost also has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority, in response to the earlier disrespect shown to him at the council of vampires. Meanwhile, Blade comes upon Pearl, a morbidly obese vampire, and tortures him with a UV light into revealing that Deacon wants to command a ritual where he would use 12 pure-blood vampires to awaken the &quot;blood god&quot; La Magra, and Blade&#x27;s blood is the key.

Later, at the hideout, Blade injects himself with a special serum that suppresses his urge to drink blood. However, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse. While experimenting with the anticoagulant EDTA as a possible replacement, Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected but learns that it will not work on Blade. Karen is confident that she can cure Blade&#x27;s bloodthirst but it would take her years of treating it.

Frost and his men attack the hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he helps Whistler commit suicide. When Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost&#x27;s penthouse, he is shocked to find his still-alive mother, who reveals that she came back the night she was attacked and was brought in by Frost, who appears and reveals himself as the vampire who bit her. Blade is then subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra. Karen is thrown into a pit to be devoured by Webb, who has transformed into a decomposing zombie-like creature. Karen injures Webb and escapes. Blade is drained of his blood, but Karen allows him to drink from her, enabling him to recover. Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra. Blade confronts Frost after killing all of his minions, including his mother, but initially finds him too powerful to defeat. Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes of EDTA, and the overdose causes his body to inflate and explode, finally killing him.

Karen offers to help Blade cure himself; instead, he asks her to create an improved version of the serum so he can continue his crusade against vampires. In a brief epilogue, Blade confronts a vampire in Moscow.

==Production==
===Background===
The character Blade was created in 1973 for Marvel Comics by the writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan as a supporting character in the 1970s comic &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;. The comic Blade used teakwood knives and was much more the everyman in his behavior and attitude. Though courageous and brave, he displayed flaws as well, such as an inability to get along with certain other supporting cast members and a hatred of vampires that bordered on fanaticism.

The character was not originally a &quot;daywalker&quot; but a human being immune to being turned into a vampire. Lacking the superhuman speed and strength of his undead quarry, he relied solely on his wits and skill until he was bitten by the character Morbius as seen in &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; #8, first published in August 1999. The film portrayal of Blade was updated for a 1990s audience and the comics character was subsequently modified to match. Goyer replaced the daggers Blade used in the comics with a sword and gave him a more samurai-like aesthetic. The film&#x27;s version of Deacon Frost also differs greatly from his comic counterpart. He was older with white hair and literally a church deacon, but the film retains Frost&#x27;s upstart ambitions.

===Development===
When New World Pictures bought the rights to Marvel Comics, they were set to make a Mexico-set western starring Richard Roundtree as the vampire hunter. Marvel Studios then started to develop the film in early 1992, when rapper/actor LL Cool J was interested in playing the lead role. &quot;Blade&quot; was eventually set up at New Line Cinema, with David S. Goyer writing the script. When Goyer heard a film was in development he went in to pitch with director Ernest Dickerson. David Fincher was also attached to the project and even worked on the script with Goyer. New Line Cinema originally wanted to do &quot;Blade&quot; as &quot;something that was almost a spoof&quot; before the writer convinced them otherwise. At one point, the studio even asked if Blade could be white. Goyer wanted to take the character seriously, and ground them in a sense of reality with vampirism as a biological disease. He even pitched a trilogy of movies &quot;almost Wagnerian in scope&quot;. He also wanted to demystify the vampires and treat them as serious villains with a greater sense of realism instead of the doomed romantic characters shown in Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. Goyer&#x27;s early drafts predated but took a similar post-modern approach as the films &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;.
After failing to get a Black Panther film into production, in 1996, Wesley Snipes signed on to star as Blade. Snipes also produced through his company Amen Ra Films, and worked with the writers to invest the story with elements of classic tragedy - ”like &quot;Lear, like &quot;Hamlet&quot;- to heighten the characters&#x27; emotional drama.

===Casting===
When Goyer first pitched the idea of doing a &quot;Blade&quot; film, Michael De Luca, head of New Line Cinema, suggested Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, and Laurence Fishburne, but to Goyer, Snipes was always the perfect choice for Blade. The finalized script was sent to Snipes and no other actor was seriously considered.

Patrick McGoohan was the first choice to play Whistler, as Stephen Norrington was a fan of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967). Jon Voight was also considered for the role.

===Filming===
&quot;Blade&quot; was produced on a budget of $45 million and principal photography commenced on February 5, 1997, in large part done in Los Angeles, with some scenes being shot in Death Valley. All sets were constructed, and all on-set filming occurred, in what was formerly the Redken Shampoo factory in Canoga Park. The effects for the film were done by Flat Earth Productions.

===Post-production===
The first cut of the film was 140 minutes long. It had a disastrous test screening with audiences. Heavy edits and re-shoots were implemented which delayed the release date for more than half a year. The most significant change was the addition of the final sword fight between Blade and Deacon Frost, which did not exist in the original cut. In the original ending, Frost turned into La Magra and became a large swirling mass of blood instead of keeping his form. This was scrapped because the filmmakers could not get the special effects to look right. It can be seen as a special feature on the DVD. Stan Lee originally had a cameo that was ultimately cut from the film. He played one of the cops that came into the blood club during the aftermath and discover Quinn&#x27;s body on fire. The scene where Karen and Deacon are talking about the cure for vampirism initially ran slightly longer and answered the question of how the vampires would feed if everybody was turned into a vampire. They would keep some humans alive in giant blood bags to harvest them. The bags can still be seen in a doorway during the scene, and later played an integral part of the plot in &quot;&quot;.

Marvel was not going to give Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan credit for the characters they had created, but Goyer insisted. He asked New Line and they accepted, but representatives of Marv Wolfman said only he should get credit, and not Gene Colan. Goyer insisted that both be credited.

==Music==

A soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on August 25, 1998, by TVT Records and Epic Records. It peaked at #36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #28 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The British techno band The Prodigy was approached to do the soundtrack and score to the film but had to turn down the offer due to other commitments.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Blade&quot; premiered on August 19, 1998 at New York&#x27;s Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, with another screening at Los Angeles&#x27; Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre the following day before opening wide on August 21. The film was banned from showing in Malaysia, widely considered to have the most controlling censors in Southeast Asia.

===Home media===
&quot;Blade&quot; was first released on DVD and VHS on December 1, 1998 by New Line Home Entertainment.

The film was released on Blu-ray on June 19, 2012.

The film was released in 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on December 1, 2020. The remastered 4K release differs from earlier versions by using a widescreen 2.39:1 format.

===Lawsuits===
Marv Wolfman unsuccessfully sued Marvel and New Line Cinema for $35 million after the release of the film, claiming he was not bound by a work for hire contract when he created the character in 1972. He, along with artist Gene Colan, received a &quot;based on characters created by&quot; credit in this film. Three extras in the blood rave scene sued the studios and effects company Reel Creations Inc. claiming the stage blood caused permanent blemishes to their skin.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In North America, &quot;Blade&quot; dislodged &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, which led the previous four weeks in the box office, to finish at number one with $17.1 million across 2,322 screens. The film would top the box office for two weekends until it was overtaken by &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;. The film also opened in number one in both Spain, with $1.5 million (US) in 200 theaters, and Australia, with $1 million from 132 cinemas. In the Flemish Region of Belgium, the film earned $323,000 from 20 cinemas, and the Netherlands earned the film $246,000 from 44 cinemas. France made $1.9 million in five days from 241 cinemas, but the film was less successful in Hong Kong (with $182,000 from 22 cinemas) and South Africa ($159,000 from 64 cinemas). The United Kingdom was more successful, taking in $5.7 million over 10 days, as was Brazil, making $855,000 in four days from 133 cinemas. &quot;Blade&quot; remained atop the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $11.1 million. &quot;Blade&quot; finished its box office run with $70 million domestically and $61 million worldwide for a total of $131.2 million.

Despite the success of the film, Marvel shared only a flat fee of $25,000.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Though some may find the plot a bit lacking, &quot;Blade&quot;″s action is fierce, plentiful, and appropriately stylish for a comic book adaptation.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing: &quot;&quot;Blade&quot; ... is a movie that relishes high visual style. It uses the extreme camera angles, the bizarre costumes and sets, the exaggerated shadows, the confident cutting between long shots and extreme closeups. It slams ahead in pure visceral imagery&quot;. James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, writing: &quot;&quot;Blade&quot; has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied&quot;. Berardinelli also wrote: &quot;&quot;Blade&quot; opens brilliantly, with a series of fast-paced, visually-engaging scenes that display the seedy underbelly of vampire society and introduce the implacable title character in true superhero fashion. For about its first hour, the movie offers violent, visceral, rapid fire entertainment that concentrates as much on developing a distinctive atmosphere as on advancing a minimalist storyline. Unfortunately [...] it keeps going and going, eventually wearing out its welcome&quot;. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements -- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action -- into a workable whole&quot;. John Krewson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was critical of the story and the dialogue, but praised the &quot;creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence&quot;.

Critics such as A. Asbjørn Jøn have noted not only the important place of &quot;Blade&quot; in the wider vampire genre, but also possible intertextual links between the Whistler character and a character named Whistler in &quot;A Dozen Black Roses&quot; (1996) by Nancy A. Collins, as they possess &quot;striking similarities in role, dramatic focus, visual appearance, and sharing the name&quot;.

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for Best Horror Film and Best Make-up at the Saturn Awards. Stephen Dorff won Best Villain at the MTV Movie Awards while Wesley Snipes was nominated for Best Fight.

==Video game==

A video game prequel was published and released by Activision in 2000 for the PlayStation. The game received mixed reviews. On Metacritic it received a weighted average score 51% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. A separate game for the Game Boy Color was also released.

==Sequels==

The success of the film led to two sequels, &quot;Blade II&quot; in 2002, &quot;Blade Trinity&quot; in 2004, as well as a television series.

==Legacy==

In August 2014, Snipes spoke about his desire to return to the franchise: &quot;I&#x27;d be open to it. I think we&#x27;ve got some stones left unturned and there&#x27;s some latitude left for us to build on and I&#x27;d love to get back in the suit again and do some things I&#x27;ve learned how to do now that I didn&#x27;t know how to do then&quot;.

During their 2019 San Diego Comic-Con presentation, Marvel Studios announced a &quot;Blade&quot; reboot set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Mahershala Ali starring as Blade. Some fans of Snipes were disappointed, but Snipes expressed his support for Ali saying he would &quot;do great&quot;.

In 2021, Marvel published &quot;The Darkhold: Blade&quot; one-shot written by Daniel Kibblesmith, presenting an alternate ending to the film, where Deacon Frost succeeded in his plans at using his power attained as avatar of La Magra to turn billions of humans around the world into vampires.

In 2024, Snipes reprised his role as Blade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

<text>The Tuolumne River (Yokutsan: &quot;Tawalimnu&quot;) flows for through Central California, from the high Sierra Nevada to join the San Joaquin River in the Central Valley. Originating at over above sea level in Yosemite National Park, the Tuolumne drains a rugged watershed of , carving a series of canyons through the western slope of the Sierra. While the upper Tuolumne is a fast-flowing mountain stream, the lower river crosses a broad, fertile and extensively cultivated alluvial plain. Like most other central California rivers, the Tuolumne is dammed multiple times for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectricity.

Humans have inhabited the Tuolumne River area for up to 10,000 years. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the river canyon provided an important summer hunting ground and a trade route between Native Americans in the Central Valley to the west and the Great Basin to the east. First named in 1806 by a Spanish explorer after a nearby indigenous village, the Tuolumne was heavily prospected during the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, and the lower valley was cultivated by American settlers over the next few decades. The city of Modesto grew up on the Tuolumne as a railroad hub, absorbing most of the population of the Tuolumne valley around the turn of the century. As agricultural production rose, farmers along the Tuolumne formed California&#x27;s first two irrigation districts to better control and develop the river.

From the 1900s to the 1930s, the river was dammed at Don Pedro and Hetch Hetchy to provide water for Central Valley farmers and the city of San Francisco, respectively. The Hetch Hetchy project, located inside Yosemite National Park, incited national controversy, and has been described as having forged the modern environmental movement in the United States. As the mid-20th century progressed, demands on the Tuolumne continued to increase, culminating in the completion of New Don Pedro Dam in the early 1970s. These projects halved the amount of water flowing from the Tuolumne into the San Joaquin, greatly reducing the once-abundant runs of salmon and steelhead in both rivers.

==Course==
The Tuolumne originates in Yosemite National Park, high in the Sierra Nevada, as two streams. The Lyell Fork rises at the Lyell Glacier below Mount Lyell, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park, and flows north through Lyell Canyon. The Dana Fork originates between Mount Dana () and Mount Gibbs () and flows west.

After the confluence of the forks in Tuolumne Meadows, the river meanders northwest, passing under Tioga Road. Although calm for the first few miles, this quickly changes as the river drops over Tuolumne Falls and White Cascades. After briefly passing through Glen Aulin, the river enters the spectacular Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, where it forms three more major waterfalls – California, LeConte and Waterwheel Falls. Return and Piute Creeks join the river from the north within the Tuolumne Canyon. At the end of the canyon the river widens into Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, formed by a dam built in 1923 to provide water to the city of San Francisco, in the scenic Hetch Hetchy Valley. Falls Creek forms Wapama Falls and Tueeulala Falls, two of the highest in Yosemite, as it enters the reservoir from the north. From its source at above sea level in Tuolumne Meadows, the river drops nearly a mile (1.6 km) to the Hetch Hetchy reservoir at .

Below the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam the Tuolumne passes Poopenaut Valley and enters a series of continuous canyons as it flows through the Sierra foothills, leaving the western boundary of Yosemite National Park and entering the Stanislaus National Forest. Most of the Tuolumne&#x27;s main tributaries join within this reach, beginning with Cherry Creek from the north just below the intake of the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which delivers water to San Francisco. The South Fork of the Tuolumne joins from the south a few miles downstream, near Groveland-Big Oak Flat, followed by the Clavey River from the north a few miles after that. The North Fork of the Tuolumne joins from the north near the upper end of Lake Don Pedro, which was formed in 1971 when the New Don Pedro Dam was built to provide hydroelectricity and irrigation water storage. Directly below Don Pedro Dam is the La Grange Dam, where about half the river&#x27;s natural flow is diverted into the Turlock and Modesto Main Canals to irrigate over in the Central Valley.
Leaving the foothills, the Tuolumne flows approximately west across the Central Valley to its confluence with the San Joaquin River, passing Waterford, Hughson, Empire, Ceres and Modesto. The lower Tuolumne is wide and slow-flowing, dropping just from the base of La Grange Dam to its mouth at . Highway 99 and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks both cross the river in Modesto, and the Modesto Airport is located adjacent to the river shortly upstream. Dry Creek joins the Tuolumne from the north between the airport and the railroad. The confluence of the Tuolumne and San Joaquin is located in the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, about north of Grayson in Stanislaus County.

===Discharge===

By volume, the Tuolumne is the largest river draining the southern Sierra, with an estimated virgin flow of per year – over . Near the river&#x27;s mouth, the highest recorded annual volume was or in 1983, and the lowest was or in 1977 – a 30:1 difference. Although most of the flow in the river originates from summer snowmelt, massive floods can occur following heavy winter storms. The natural flow of the Tuolumne at the mouth is greatly reduced by diversions to both San Francisco&#x27;s Hetch Hetchy municipal water system and the canals of the Modesto and Turlock irrigation districts.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates, or has operated, several stream gauges along the Tuolumne River. Today, average annual river flows reach a maximum in the short stretch between Don Pedro Dam and La Grange Dam, about above the mouth, before the start of large irrigation diversions. A USGS gage recorded an average annual flow of here between 1911 and 1970, with a maximum peak of on January 31, 1911, and a minimum monthly mean of in October 1912. During the Great Flood of 1862, the river reached an estimated peak of here, after a record of rain fell in the Tuolumne River basin between November 11, 1861, and January 14, 1862, as recorded at Sonora. The gage was not in place during this time.

Further downstream, the USGS gage at Modesto – about above the mouth – recorded an annual mean of between 1940 and 2013. The highest peak was on December 9, 1950, and the lowest daily mean was on August 6, 1977.

==Watershed==

===Physiography===
The Tuolumne River watershed can be divided into three distinct physiographic regions. From the headwaters to below Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the river drains the Sierra highlands, which are characterized by solid, glacier-carved granitic bedrock, thin poor soils and areas of heavy forestation. Most of the snowpack that feeds the Tuolumne accumulates in this region. Streams are generally high-gradient, clear and rocky, but large alpine meadows provide riparian and wetland habitat, which contribute sediment to the watershed&#x27;s runoff. There are also a large number of natural lakes and tarns in the upper watershed. The Sierra crest harbors a number of glaciers, including Lyell and Maclure Glaciers, the largest in Yosemite National Park. Melting ice feeds the upper reaches of the Tuolumne River, maintaining water flow in the late summer when many other streams in the region are dry. The Lyell Glacier is the second largest in the Sierra Nevada, after Palisade Glacier at the headwaters of Big Pine Creek a tributary of the Owens River. Both Lyell and Maclure glaciers have shrunk significantly since the late 1800s when measurements were first made.

Between Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and the upper end of Lake Don Pedro the Tuolumne flows through the Sierra foothills, where it has a lower gradient but continues to maintain a fast current. Stream pools and gravel bars figure more prominently in the channel, allowing the growth of riparian habitat. By the time the river reaches Lake Don Pedro it has accumulated almost 90 percent of its total flow as precipitation run-off, snowmelt and groundwater base flow. Below Don Pedro Dam the river flows across the large alluvial plain of the San Joaquin Valley, formed by millions of years of sediment deposits eroded from the Sierra. Historically this section of the river was subject to frequent course changes and formed thousands of acres of seasonal wetlands during the spring floods. Since the introduction of large-scale agriculture the Tuolumne River course has been fixed between an extensive system of levees. More than in the San Joaquin Valley are irrigated using Tuolumne water.

About , or 34 percent, of the Tuolumne River watershed is inside Yosemite National Park. The rivers whose watersheds border that of the Tuolumne are the Stanislaus River and West Walker River in the north, the Merced River in the south, the East Walker River to the northeast, the Mono Lake basin (Mill Creek, Lee Vining Creek and Rush Creek) to the east, and the headwaters of the San Joaquin River proper to the southeast.

====Tributaries====
Major tributaries of the Tuolumne and pertinent data are listed in the below table. Order is from the headwaters downstream.

===Land use===
Almost 80 percent of the Tuolumne River watershed lies above New Don Pedro Dam and is primarily forested with some alpine, meadow and grassland zones. The primary land use in the lower Tuolumne River watershed is agriculture, but there are also significant urbanized areas. Although only about (5.4 percent) of the watershed itself are farmed, river water is used to irrigate almost five times that area outside the watershed boundaries. About (1.3 percent) of the watershed are urbanized, mostly in the Greater Modesto area. About 550,000 people inhabit the Tuolumne River watershed as a whole, with approximately 210,000 living in Modesto.

===Engineering and flood control===
Like most other Sierra Nevada rivers, the Tuolumne has been extensively dammed to provide flood control, water supply, and hydroelectric power. The uppermost dam is the O&#x27;Shaughnessy, which impounds the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, providing water and power to the City of San Francisco. The Hetch Hetchy hydroelectric system diverts large volumes of water into tunnels that feed two hydroelectric plants, the Kirkwood and the Moccasin. The power system is efficient because of the Tuolumne&#x27;s great drop, over , between Hetch Hetchy and the outlet of Moccasin Powerhouse. However, it also causes dewatering of significant portions of the Tuolumne River, especially during low water summers when all but a minimal fish release is diverted through the power plants. Not all of the flow used by the power plants is returned to the river. About per year flows through the gravity fed Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct to serve San Francisco and its customer municipalities. Due to the pristine quality of the water, the Hetch Hetchy system is one of only a few serving major cities in the United States that does not require filtration.
Cherry Creek, the Tuolumne&#x27;s biggest tributary, is also part of the San Francisco hydroelectric system. Cherry Creek is dammed at the Cherry Valley Dam, which creates Cherry Lake. A major tributary, Eleanor Creek, is dammed to form Lake Eleanor, and diverted into Cherry Lake through a tunnel. The combined flow is channeled into a penstock and returns to the river at the Holm Powerhouse. Unlike the Hetch Hetchy system, the Cherry Creek system is used exclusively for hydropower, not water supply, because the water quality is not quite as good. However, there is a connecting aqueduct that allows Cherry Lake to be tapped to supply the Hetch Hetchy system during severe droughts. This backup water supply was last used during late 2015, as a test to ensure its functionality should drought conditions become worse. The previous time it was used was 1988.
Below the confluence with the North Fork of the Tuolumne the river flows into Lake Don Pedro, the largest in the Tuolumne River system and the sixth-largest man made lake in California at . The earth-filled New Don Pedro Dam, high, is the 10th tallest dam in the United States and was constructed as a multipurpose project, serving irrigation, municipal water supply, hydropower and flood control. It replaced an earlier concrete dam built on approximately the same site. The Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts control the lion&#x27;s share of water in the reservoir, although the City of San Francisco also has storage rights, which it uses mainly to offset the effects of water diverted upstream at Hetch Hetchy. Because of the desire to increase water storage for other uses, only of the reservoir is designated flood control, which is relatively small compared to other reservoirs in California. As a result, Don Pedro frequently fills and spills during winter storms, causing damage downstream.

The La Grange Dam, a much smaller masonry diversion dam, is the last one on the Tuolumne before it joins with the San Joaquin. Modesto Canal, on the north side of the river, and Turlock Canal, on the south side, are both large irrigation diversions. The Modesto Canal feeds the off-stream Modesto Reservoir, which regulates the water for distribution to farmers. The Turlock Lake is regulated by the similar but much larger Turlock Lake, which has a capacity of . The estimated annual diversion for irrigation is , about half of the Tuolumne River&#x27;s natural flow.

Below La Grange, the Tuolumne – much reduced due to irrigation diversions – flows through a fixed channel with a highly restricted floodplain. Before agriculture, the river inundated large areas of seasonal marshland and was free to change course during its frequent floods. Today farms and communities are protected by a levee system with a channel capacity of roughly at the 9th St. Bridge in Modesto – significantly smaller than the river&#x27;s maximum flood potential. The valley is dependent on flood control storage at Lake Don Pedro to prevent flows from exceeding the channel capacity. However, this has happened many times, most infamously during the New Year&#x27;s Flood of 1997, during which inflows to Don Pedro hit , the largest recorded since the Great Flood of 1862. Water releases from Don Pedro Dam peaked at ; while this vastly reduced potential damage from the flood, it still exceeded the channel capacity by six times, causing extensive property damage along the river.

===Fish, plants and wildlife===
The Tuolumne once supported large spring and fall runs of chinook salmon (king salmon, &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) and steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). In its native state the fall Chinook run alone may have numbered as high as 130,000. With the exception of the Merced River immediately south, this is the southernmost existing population of Chinook salmon in North America. Massive irrigation diversions and river channelization projects have led to the extinction of the spring Chinook run and greatly reduced the fall run. Dams have blocked more than half of the original of migratory fish spawning habitat in the Tuolumne River watershed. The San Joaquin River and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, which link the Tuolumne salmon runs to the Pacific, have also been affected by flow reduction and pollution. In addition, introduced species such as striped bass prey on juvenile salmon, consuming as much as 93 percent of smolt before they can migrate to the sea. A controversial proposal by the State Water Resources Control Board from around 2013 would require increased spring and summer flows on the Tuolumne River which would benefit native anadromous fish populations, but greatly reduce the water supply available for farms and cities. This has been countered by irrigation districts who maintain that the aforementioned predation, not low flows, are the primary cause of salmon smolt deaths.

Forests in the watershed are divided between several distinct zones. The foothill region is characterized by trees and plants adapted to a hot, dry climate, including chamise (greasewood), California lilac, manzanita, blue oak, interior live oak (Sierra live oak), and gray pine. Further east and higher in elevation are the lower and upper montane forests, which lie between and elevation, respectively. The lower montane forests include black oak, ponderosa pine, incense cedar and white fir; higher up Jeffrey pine and western juniper appear. Higher still is the subalpine forest zone between , which is dominated by Western white pine, mountain hemlock and lodgepole pine. Above 9500 feet, only small shrubs, flowering plants and occasional whitebark pine populate the alpine zone, which is limited to the peaks around Tuolumne Meadows and along the Sierra Crest.

Humans have influenced natural conditions in the Tuolumne River watershed for centuries. Native Americans set controlled fires in grassland to clear out dead foliage, providing room for new growth which in turn attracted game animals to forage. They also periodically burned out oak woodland areas in the foothills to control pests, which otherwise would have affected their main food supply, acorns. During the Spanish and Mexican periods, the Central Valley was used for cattle ranching, which quickly decimated natural range grasses. During the 1880s American sheep ranchers brought their herds into the upper Tuolumne River watershed for summer pasture, which further damaged the range in the foothills and Sierras. Hetch Hetchy Valley was one of the main summer grazing areas for sheep. The decline of native perennial grasses caused invasive annual species to flourish, and also increased the susceptibility of the watershed to wildfires. In order to protect property and watershed quality, intensive fire suppression began in the early 20th century. However, this led to overgrowth and a disruption of the natural forest succession process that was previously driven by wildfires.

==Early history==
Estimates of the first human habitation along the Tuolumne River range from 3000 to 7000 BC. The Plains and Sierra Miwok, who were the largest regional Native American group immediately prior to European contact, first established themselves in the area around 1200 CE. The Miwok lived in the Sierra foothills and Central Valley lowlands during winter and traveled into the upper Tuolumne River in summer to hunt, as well as seek refuge from the summer heat. The Paiute, who inhabited the Great Basin on the east side of the Sierra, also ventured into the Tuolumne River basin during the summer. The Yokuts lived along the lower Tuolumne River and were not known to venture up into the Sierra during summer.
The chief meeting point of the Paiute and Miwok was the Hetch Hetchy Valley, rich in edible plants and game. The origin of the name &quot;Hetch Hetchy&quot; may have been a type of edible grass that grew in the valley, which native peoples made into grain and ground in stone mortars for meal.
They set controlled fires to clear out old vegetation in their gathering areas, allowing for more efficient harvesting of new growth. This would also increase the prevalence of grasses and ferns, attracting game animals such as deer, and made the landscape more easily navigable. Many of the landscapes in the Tuolumne River area encountered by the first European explorers were thus not pristine but the result of hundreds of years of management; indeed, the famous meadows of Hetch Hetchy Valley prior to its damming only existed because of the annual burn.

The origin of the Tuolumne River&#x27;s name is unclear. The first recorded use of the name &quot;Tuolumne&quot; was by the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga in 1806, who may have named the river for the nearby Native American village of &quot;Tualamne&quot; or &quot;Tautamne&quot;. This may in turn refer to the native word &quot;talmalamne&quot;, or &quot;a group of stone huts or caves&quot;. Father Pedro Muñoz, a member of the 1806 expedition, noted in his diary that &quot;we came upon a village called Tautamne. This village is situated on some steep precipices, inaccessible on account of their rough rocks. The Indians live in their sótanos [cellars or caves]&quot;. At this time, the Native American population along the lower Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers is believed to have been approximately two thousand.
Another possible origin of the name &quot;Tuolumne&quot; is the Central Sierra Miwok word &quot;taawalïmi&quot;, meaning &quot;squirrel place&quot;, referring to a Native American village on the nearby Stanislaus River. The suffix &quot;-umne&quot;, which appears in the names of two other California rivers, the Mokelumne and Cosumnes, is thought to have meant &quot;place of&quot; or &quot;people of&quot; in the native language.

The Tuolumne River was the scene of significant gold mining activity during the California Gold Rush. The first known discovery of gold in the area was made by Benjamin Wood, a prospector from Oregon, in the summer of 1848. During the latter part of that year and early 1849, mining camps were established along the Tuolumne, including Jamestown, Tuttletown, Melones, Don Pedros Bar, and Shaws Flat. The following spring a party of Mexican miners from Sonora discovered an even richer deposit farther upstream, establishing Sonoranian Camp, predecessor of the present-day town of Sonora, California. By the end of 1849, there were over 10,000 miners in the Tuolumne River area, half of them in Sonora, which became the Tuolumne County seat in 1850.
Mining activity increased dramatically in the early 1850s, with prospectors pushing up into the foothills beyond Soulsbyville. In March 1850, an &quot;enormously rich&quot; deposit was discovered at Columbia. The same year, the Bonanza Mine near Sonora yielded a 1500-ounce nugget, the fourth largest ever discovered in California. (The largest was found in Carson Hill in Calaveras County, just north of the Tuolumne River watershed along the Stanislaus River, in 1854.) The prosperity in the region prompted a search for a new crossing of the Sierra Nevada that would provide more direct access to the camps from the east. The Clark-Skidmore Party made this crossing in 1852 via the upper Stanislaus River and the north fork of the Tuolumne. Parts of the route they established eventually formed the Walker River Trail, regarded as one of the more difficult of the main Sierra crossings.

For a brief period the lower Tuolumne became a major steamboat route, ferrying prospectors and supplies from Stockton. Depending on water level, approximately of the lower river were navigable, from the mouth to above Waterford. The unpredictable nature of the river made both navigating and crossing difficult, so starting in the Gold Rush era many ferries were established, one of the first at Dickenson&#x27;s Ferry in the early 1850s. This particular location was the crossing of Fort Miller Road (Millerton Road), a major land trade route that connected Stockton with Millerton near present-day Fresno (today the site of the Millerton Lake reservoir).

By 1853, most of the easily mined gold had been exhausted, and hydraulic mining operations became the dominant extraction method. The Tuolumne County Water Company, first organized in 1851 to divert water from the Tuolumne River basin to the Stanislaus River, constructed a network of reservoirs, ditches and flumes initially used for mining and later for irrigation. The Golden Rock Water Company, incorporated in 1855, diverted the South Fork of the Tuolumne to supply the diggings at Groveland and Big Oak Flat; their most notable achievement was the construction of a long, high aqueduct (the Big Gap Flume) over Buck Meadows. The first dam on the Tuolumne River proper, near La Grange, was built in 1852 to divert water for hydraulic mining. Sediment and rocks washed down by hydraulic mining and sluicing operations accumulated along the lower Tuolumne, destroying native floodplain habitat and making much of the river unnavigable.

==Irrigation, power and water supply==

===La Grange and Old Don Pedro Dams===
After the gold rush many miners settled along the lower Tuolumne River as farmers. Ferry sites grew into lively towns, such as at Waterford, where a crossing had been established in 1866. The town of Tuolumne City was founded near the mouth of the Tuolumne as a port, but it soon became apparent that mining debris had made the river unsuitable for navigation, and the area was abandoned. In the mid-1860s Tuolumne City and Paradise (located about further up the river) were reestablished as farming communities. The founding of Modesto in 1870, along a new railroad through the San Joaquin Valley, drew most of the population away from these towns and others along the Tuolumne. By the early 1900s Modesto&#x27;s population numbered more than four thousand.
As it became apparent that the Central Valley&#x27;s seasonal rainfall patterns made it unsuitable for dryland farming, farmers organized to build irrigation infrastructure along the Tuolumne River. Turlock Irrigation District (TID), established in 1887, was the first irrigation district in California, and the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) was established soon after in the same year. The two districts serve the south and north sides of the river, respectively. The present-day La Grange Dam, completed in 1893, replaced the older mining dam at the same site; at , it was the highest overflow dam in the United States. The dam diverted the river into canals that water most of the lower valley. The first TID farmers received water in 1900. The MID canal took a total of thirteen years to complete, with the first water deliveries on June 27, 1903.

As the population of the area grew, the Tuolumne River districts soon began to experience seasonal water shortages. The Dallas-Warner Reservoir (today&#x27;s Modesto Reservoir) was completed in 1912 on the north side of the river, but was only considered a temporary solution. Construction on the first Don Pedro Dam began in 1921 to store floodwaters of the Tuolumne proper, allowing for the extension of the irrigation season and to provide water during dry years. A secondary purpose for the construction of the dam was that TID and MID were aware that the city of San Francisco, west of the river, coveted water from the Tuolumne. Although the irrigation districts had the primary rights to the Tuolumne under the doctrine of prior appropriation, those rights could be relinquished under the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; rule, so storage had to be developed to enable the full beneficial use of river water. Named for the Gold Rush mining camp its reservoir submerged, the Don Pedro dam was completed in 1923, holding back of water. In 1923 and 1924 both Don Pedro and La Grange dams were fitted for hydroelectric generation.

===Hetch Hetchy Project===
San Francisco did not move forward with plans to divert the Tuolumne until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fires devastated the city, proving the inadequacy of the existing water system. After exploring fourteen sites throughout Central California, San Francisco had settled on the Tuolumne&#x27;s Hetch Hetchy Valley as the ideal location to develop storage and hydroelectric power. Because the area had been located inside Yosemite National Park since 1890, the city petitioned for Congress to pass the Raker Act. Signed in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson, the Act allowed San Francisco to dam the Tuolumne River, as long as the water and power provided would be reserved exclusively for public utility, not private sale.
The Hetch Hetchy Valley became the center of the first major environmental controversy in the United States. John Muir, the leader of the Sierra Club, spearheaded a legal battle against the proposed O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam, famously stating – &quot;Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the peoples&#x27; cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.&quot; The Hetch Hetchy debacle is often credited with birthing modern environmentalism, sharply dividing the conservation movement – which favored the development of natural resources for public benefit – and the preservationists, who believed that sites of scenic value like Hetch Hetchy were better left for public recreation and enjoyment.

Despite the controversy, the city of San Francisco pushed through, beginning construction in early 1914 and filling the reservoir for the first time in May 1923. The Hetch Hetchy Railroad was built along of the Tuolumne River Canyon to provide access to the remote construction site. Hydroelectric power reached San Francisco by 1925, but the first water was not delivered until 1934. Today, San Francisco diverts about 33 percent of the flow of the Tuolumne at Hetch Hetchy, or 14 percent of the river&#x27;s total flow.

===New Don Pedro Dam and modern development===
By the mid 20th century it was clear that storage capacity in Tuolumne River reservoirs was insufficient to meet growing water demands. The irrigation dam at Don Pedro could only store enough water for a single growing season, allowing little carryover for drought years, and on the other hand providing very little flood control. In the late 1950s TID and MID began planning for a high dam on the Tuolumne River several miles below the existing Don Pedro Dam. In 1961 voters approved revenue bonds to fund the project. However, it took until 1966 for the Federal Power Commission (now FERC) to greenlight the project. Concerns that the new dam would impact king salmon populations were the primary cause of the delay.

Construction of the dam began in 1967 and the river was diverted in September 1968. The embankment was topped out on May 28, 1970, and the project was formally dedicated on May 22, 1971, after four years of construction and a total cost of over $110 million. It would be eleven years before the new reservoir of – ten times the size of Old Don Pedro – filled completely in June 1982. The reservoir submerged of the middle Tuolumne River and of surrounding land, including the historic Gold Rush town of Jacksonville.

===Dam proposals===

Since the 1970s, the Turlock Irrigation District has proposed damming the Clavey River, a free-flowing tributary of the Tuolumne, to produce hydroelectricity. The dam would have been high and dried up most of the lower Clavey, a popular whitewater run. In 1994 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission studied the project and determined that the benefits would not justify the financial and environmental costs.

==Recreation==
The Tuolumne River watershed receives over a million recreational visits each year, primarily to the protected wilderness areas of Yosemite National Park and to the difficult but popular whitewater on the Main Tuolumne and Cherry Creek.

The Tuolumne is considered a classic California whitewater run, and has been used recreationally since the 1960s. Most rafters put in at Meral&#x27;s Pool, located about below Cherry Creek, for the run to Lake Don Pedro. Several rafting companies serve the main Tuolumne, a Class IV+ (advanced) river with many rapids changing to Class V when the flow exceeds . The most difficult single rapids is Clavey Falls, located just above the Clavey River; the longest is Grey&#x27;s Grindstone, at nearly a mile (1.6 km). Between these two rapids the swimming holes of the Clavey are a popular camping spot during the summer. The Cherry Creek is also run by commercial trips. It is considered one of the most difficult whitewater rivers in the entire United States, with fifteen Class V rapids. Both runs are dam controlled, which usually extends the rafting season through the dry late summer and fall.

In Yosemite National Park, the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne (from Tuolumne Meadows to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir) was first kayaked in 1983. This segment is rated Class IV-V+, with many waterfalls requiring a portage. In addition to being extremely difficult (if not borderline impossible at the aforementioned waterfalls) the water flow depends entirely on rain and snow melt, and the whitewater season can be extremely short during dry years. The general consensus is &quot;that the best paddling in is the upper miles while the middle section is better for hikers and canyoneers.&quot;

The Clavey River, not being located in the national park, is open to public access, but due to its remoteness and difficulty (Class V+), and the short window of boatable spring runoff, it is only run by a handful of kayakers each year.

To protect the river, the U.S. Forest Service requires private trips to obtain a permit before floating the Tuolumne. Running the Tuolumne within Yosemite National Park was also in a legal gray zone until 2015, when the park opened the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers to limited paddling and rafting.

== Wildfire ==
In 2013, the Rim Fire burned 257,314 acres. This megafire was, at the time, California&#x27;s third largest wildfire on record. This wildfire devastated habitat for many native and/or endangered species, and has impacted recreational opportunities, communities and economies alike.

<text>The United States Wrestling Association (USWA) was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Championship Wrestling.

==History==
===Foundation===
The USWA was founded as an attempt to create a fourth national promotion, alongside Jim Crockett Promotions/WCW, AWA and the WWF (now known as WWE). The USWA was created through a merger of the WCCW (from Texas) and the CWA (based in Memphis, Tennessee). It originally promoted shows, usually headlined by Jerry Lawler, in both Tennessee and Texas.

===WCCW withdraws===
The Dallas promotion (formerly WCCW), which was 40 percent owned by the Von Erich family, withdrew from the USWA in September 1990 due to a revenue dispute. According to Skandor Akbar, there were lawsuits involved, most notably when Jerry Jarrett was sued by Kevin Von Erich. That promotion reverted to the World Class name, but ceased operations two months later due to lack of revenue.

Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler brought the USWA back to Texas, but only on a limited basis, while promoters Joe Pedicino, Max Andrews, and Boni Blackstone were getting the new Global Wrestling Federation ready for a spring 1991 debut at the Sportatorium. Several of the former World Class and USWA Dallas wrestlers joined the new GWF, while others from the old CWA remained with the USWA.

===Talent exchange with the WWF===
In 1992, the USWA began a talent exchange with the WWF, which saw Lawler sign on to Vince McMahon&#x27;s federation, while several high-profile WWF stars appeared in the USWA. Dallas wrestler Gentleman Chris Adams spent a few months in the USWA in an angle involving Brian Christopher and Toni Adams, splitting his time between Memphis and Dallas&#x27; GWF during this time frame.

===Struggling to stay relevant during the &quot;Monday Night War&quot;===
The wrestling landscape changed in 1995 - the Monday Night War began, with WWF and WCW battling for cable television supremacy on Monday nights each and every week. As for the USWA, their biggest crowds came every Monday night at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. With a growing wrestling viewership on Monday nights that could watch pay per view-quality wrestling matches for free on television, the live attendance at the marquee events for the USWA began to dwindle. A move to Thursday nights did not help what was becoming inevitable - the demise of the USWA.

===Closure===

A combination of a poor line up, sub-standard venue, lack of talent and holding the show on a Thursday night led to a show on October 3, 1996, drawing the smallest crowd in the history of Memphis wrestling: just 372 fans, paying $1,800, to the Big One Flea Market. The future of the promotion was being questioned, following the previous week&#x27;s resignation of general manager Randy Hales. The Louisville and Nashville crowds had stayed consistent, but the Memphis crowds, which in the past had carried the promotion, had fallen over the past few months. In addition, the Big One (Flea Market) pavilion was less than inviting, the zigzag roof of its original owner (The Treasury Stores) causing its major leaking problem.

<text>5 Astraea () is an asteroid in the asteroid belt. This object is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of and an orbital eccentricity of 0.19. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 5.37° to the plane of the ecliptic. It is spinning with a period of 16.8 h. The surface of Astraea is highly reflective and its composition is probably a mixture of nickel–iron with silicates of magnesium and iron. It is an S-type asteroid in the Tholen classification system.

==Discovery and name==
Astraea was the fifth asteroid discovered, on 8 December 1845, by Karl Ludwig Hencke and named for Astraea, a Greek goddess of justice named after the stars. It was his first of two asteroid discoveries. The second was 6 Hebe. A German amateur astronomer and post office headmaster, Hencke was looking for 4 Vesta when he stumbled on Astraea. The King of Prussia awarded him an annual pension of 1200 marks for the discovery.

Hencke&#x27;s symbol for Astraea is an inverted anchor, in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1F778 🝸 (), though given Astraea&#x27;s role with justice and precision, it is perhaps a stylized set of scales, or a typographic substitute for one. 
This symbol is no longer used. The astrological symbol is a percent sign, encoded specifically at U+2BD9 ⯙. The modern astronomical symbol is a simple encircled 5 (⑤).

For 38 years after the discovery of the fourth known asteroid, Vesta, in 1807, no further asteroids were discovered. After the discovery of Astraea, 8 more were discovered in the following 5 years, and 24 were found in the 5 years after that. The discovery of Astraea proved to be the starting point for the eventual demotion of the four original asteroids (which were regarded as planets at the time) to their current status, as it became apparent that these four were only the largest of a new type of celestial body with thousands of members.

==Characteristics==
Photometry indicates prograde rotation, that the north pole points in the direction of right ascension 115° or 310° and declination 55°, with a 5° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 33°. With an apparent magnitude of 8.7 (on a favorable opposition on 15 February 2016), it is only the seventeenth-brightest main-belt asteroid, and fainter than, for example, 192 Nausikaa or even 324 Bamberga (at rare near-perihelion oppositions).

An stellar occultation on 6 June 2008 allowed Astraea&#x27;s diameter to be estimated; it was found to be .

<text>Learned helplessness is the behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused by the subject&#x27;s acceptance of their powerlessness, by way of their discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness. Over the past few decades, neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness and shown that the original theory was the wrong way about—the brain&#x27;s default state is to assume that control is not present. The presence of control is therefore learned. However, it is unlearned when a subject is faced with prolonged aversive stimulation.

In humans, learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy, the individual&#x27;s belief in their innate ability to achieve goals. Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from a real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.

==Foundation of research and theory==
===Early experiments===

American psychologist Martin Seligman initiated research on learned helplessness in 1967 at the University of Pennsylvania as an extension of his interest in depression. This research was later expanded through experiments by Seligman and others. One of the first was an experiment by Seligman &amp; Overmier: In Part 1 of this study, three groups of dogs were placed in harnesses. Group 1 dogs were simply put in a harness for a period of time and were later released. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of &quot;yoked pairs&quot;. Dogs in Group 2 were given electric shocks at random times, which the dog could end by pressing a lever. Each dog in Group 3 was paired with a Group 2 dog; whenever a Group 2 dog got a shock, its paired dog in Group 3 got a shock of the same intensity and duration, but its lever did not stop the shock. To a dog in Group 3, it seemed that the shock ended at random because it was their paired dog in Group 2 that was causing it to stop. Thus, for Group 3 dogs, the shock was &quot;inescapable&quot;.

In Part 2 of the experiment, the same three groups of dogs were tested in a shuttle-box apparatus (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). All of the dogs could escape shocks on one side of the box by jumping over a low partition to the other side. The dogs in Groups 1 and 2 quickly learned this task and escaped the shock. Most of the Group 3 which had previously learned that nothing they did had any effect on simply lay down passively and whined when they were shocked.

In a second experiment later that year with new groups of dogs, Maier and Seligman ruled out the possibility that, instead of learned helplessness, the Group 3 dogs failed to avert in the second part of the test because they had learned some behavior that interfered with &quot;escape&quot;. To prevent such interfering behavior, Group 3 dogs were immobilized with a paralyzing drug (curare) and underwent a procedure similar to that in Part 1 of the Seligman and Overmier experiment. When tested as before in Part 2, these Group 3 dogs exhibited helplessness as before. This result serves as an indicator for the ruling out of the interference hypothesis.

From these experiments, it was thought that there was to be only one cure for helplessness. In Seligman&#x27;s hypothesis, the dogs do not try to escape because they expect that nothing they do will stop the shock. To change this expectation, experimenters physically picked up the dogs and moved their legs, replicating the actions the dogs would need to take in order to escape from the electrified grid. This had to be done at least twice before the dogs would start willfully jumping over the barrier on their own. In contrast, threats, rewards, and observed demonstrations had no effect on the &quot;helpless&quot; Group 3 dogs.

===Later experiments===
Later experiments have served to confirm the depressive effect of feeling a lack of control over an aversive stimulus. For example, in one experiment, humans performed mental tasks in the presence of distracting noise. Those who could use a switch to turn off the noise performed better than those who could not turn off the noise. Simply being aware of this option was enough to substantially counteract the noise effect. In 2011, an animal study found that animals with control over stressful stimuli exhibited changes in the excitability of certain neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Animals that lacked control failed to exhibit this neural effect and showed signs consistent with learned helplessness and social anxiety. A 1992 study showed that the non-contingency between responses and outcomes when solving chess problems leads to a state of learned helplessness with chess players ranging from weak amateurs to professional players. The effects were proportional to the degree of similarity between the treatment and the task used in the post-test.

==Expanded theories==
Research has found that a human&#x27;s reaction to feeling a lack of control differs both between individuals and between situations, i.e. learned helplessness sometimes remains specific to one situation but at other times generalizes across situations. Such variations are not explained by the original theory of learned helplessness, and an influential view is that such variations depend on an individual&#x27;s attributional or explanatory style. According to this view, how someone interprets or explains adverse events affects their likelihood of acquiring learned helplessness and subsequent depression. For example, people with pessimistic explanatory style tend to see negative events as permanent (&quot;it will never change&quot;), personal (&quot;it&#x27;s my fault&quot;), and pervasive (&quot;I can&#x27;t do anything correctly&quot;), and are likely to suffer from learned helplessness and depression.

In 1978, Lyn Yvonne Abramson, Seligman, Paul and John D. Teasdale reformulated Seligman&#x27;s &amp; Paul&#x27;s work, using attribution theory. They proposed that people differed in how they classified negative experiences on three scales, from internal to external, stable to unstable, and from global to specific. They believed that people who were more likely to attribute negative events to internal, stable, and global causes were more likely to become depressed than those who attributed things to causes at the other ends of the scales.

Bernard Weiner proposed a detailed account of the attributional approach to learned helplessness in 1986. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and internality/externality:

* A &quot;global attribution&quot; occurs when the individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts.
** A &quot;specific attribution&quot; occurs when the individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation.
* A &quot;stable attribution&quot; occurs when the individual believes the cause to be consistent across time.
** An &quot;unstable attribution&quot; occurs when the individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time.
* An &quot;external attribution&quot; assigns causality to situational or external factors,
** while an &quot;internal attribution&quot; assigns causality to factors within the person.

==Neurobiological perspective==
Research has shown that increased 5-HT (serotonin) activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus plays a critical role in learned helplessness. Other key brain regions that are involved with the expression of helpless behavior include the basolateral amygdala, central nucleus of the amygdala and
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum and hypothalamus has also been observed during states of helplessness.

In the article, &quot;Exercise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain&quot;, Benjamin N. Greenwood and Monika Fleshner discuss how exercise might prevent stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. They show evidence that running wheel exercise prevents learned helplessness behaviors in rats. They suggest that the amount of exercise may not be as important as simply exercising at all. The article also discusses the neurocircuitry of learned helplessness, the role of serotonin (or 5-HT), and the exercise-associated neural adaptations that may contribute to the stress-resistant brain. However, the authors finally conclude that &quot;The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this effect, however, remain unknown. Identifying the mechanisms by which exercise prevents learned helplessness could shed light on the complex neurobiology of depression and anxiety and potentially lead to novel strategies for the prevention of stress-related mood disorders&quot;.

In developmental psychology the order of various stages of neurobiological development is important. From this perspective there are two different kinds of &quot;helplessness&quot; that appear at different stages of development. In early development, the infant is naturally helpless and must learn &quot;helpfulness&quot; toward mature neurophysiology. The &quot;helplessness&quot; that appears after maturation is what is properly termed &quot;learned helplessness&quot;, although some researchers conflate this infantile form of &quot;helplessness&quot; with the pathological, adult, form.

==Health implications==
People who perceive events as uncontrollable show a variety of symptoms that threaten their mental and physical well-being. They experience stress, they often show disruption of emotions demonstrating passivity or aggressivity, and they can also have difficulty performing cognitive tasks such as problem-solving. They are less likely to change unhealthy patterns of behavior, causing them, for example, to neglect diet, exercise, and medical treatment.

===Depression===
Abnormal and cognitive psychologists have found a strong correlation between depression-like symptoms and learned helplessness in laboratory animals. Steven Maier, a professor from the University of Colorado, states that a model of depression could be caused by &quot;impaired medial prefrontal cortical inhibitory control over stress-responsive limbic and brainstem structures.&quot; Comorbidity between psychological disorders and learned helplessness may be due to stressful events. Maier also mentions depression may not be the only mental illness that this involves, which could link to other mental illnesses. Similarly, the National Institutes of Health, in 2021, looked at a wide range of depressive models. It highlights the learned helplessness model. The model allows one to predict depressive symptoms because of its high rates of overlap with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, which is the leading research in the article, &quot;Overlapping neurobiology of learned helplessness and conditioned defeat: Implications for PTSD and mood disorders.&quot;

(See Neurobiological perspective section above for further information on this article)

Young adults and middle-aged parents with a pessimistic explanatory style often suffer from depression. They tend to be poor at problem-solving and cognitive restructuring and demonstrate poor job satisfaction and interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Those with a pessimistic style can have weakened immune systems. It includes increased vulnerability to minor ailments (e.g., cold, fever) and major illnesses (e.g., heart attack, cancers). It can also cause poorer recovery from health problems.

===Social impact===
Learned helplessness can be a factor in a wide range of social situations.
*In emotionally abusive relationships, the victim often develops learned helplessness. This occurs when the victim confronts or tries to leave the abuser only to have the abuser dismiss or trivialize the victim&#x27;s feelings, pretend to care but not change, or impede the victim from leaving. As the situation continues and the abuse gets worse, the victim will begin to give up and show signs of this learned helplessness. This can result in a traumatic bonding with one&#x27;s victimizer, as in Stockholm syndrome or Battered woman syndrome.
*Complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
*According to Gregory Bateson&#x27;s theory of schizophrenia, the disorder is a pattern of learned helplessness in people habitually caught in double binds in childhood. In such cases, the double bind is presented continually and habitually within the family context from infancy on. By the time the child is old enough to have identified the double bind situation, it has already been internalized, and the child is unable to confront it. The solution then is to create an escape from the conflicting logical demands of the double bind, in the world of the delusional system.
*The motivational effect of learned helplessness is often seen in the classroom. Students who repeatedly fail may conclude that they are incapable of improving their performance, and this attribution keeps them from trying to succeed, which results in increased helplessness, continued failure, loss of self-esteem and other social consequences. This becomes a pattern that will spiral downward if it continues to go untreated.
*Child abuse by neglect can be a manifestation of learned helplessness. For example, when parents believe they are incapable of stopping an infant&#x27;s crying, they may simply give up trying to do anything for the child. This learned helplessness will negatively impact both the parent and child.
*Those who are extremely shy or anxious in social situations may become passive due to feelings of helplessness. Gotlib and Beatty (1985) found that people who cite helplessness in social settings may be viewed poorly by others, which tends to reinforce passivity.
*Aging individuals may respond with helplessness to the deaths of friends and family members, the loss of jobs and income, and the development of age-related health problems. This may cause them to neglect their medical care, financial affairs, and other important needs.
*According to Cox &quot;et al.&quot;, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), learned helplessness is a key factor in depression that is caused by inescapable prejudice (i.e., &quot;deprejudice&quot;). Thus: &quot;Helplessness born in the face of inescapable prejudice matches the helplessness born in the face of inescapable shocks.&quot;
*According to Ruby K. Payne&#x27;s book &quot;A Framework for Understanding Poverty&quot;, treatment of the poor can lead to a cycle of poverty, a culture of poverty, and generational poverty. This type of learned helplessness is passed from parents to children. People who embrace this mentality feel there is no way to escape poverty and so one must live in the moment and not plan for the future, trapping families in poverty.
*Wealth inequality has an impact on mental health.

Social problems resulting from learned helplessness may seem unavoidable to those entrenched. However, there are various ways to reduce or prevent it. When induced in experimental settings, learned helplessness has been shown to resolve itself with the passage of time. People can be immunized against the perception that events are uncontrollable by increasing their awareness of previous experiences, when they were able to affect the desired outcome. Cognitive therapy can be used to show people that their actions do make a difference and bolster their self-esteem. Seeking out these types of treatment options can be extremely helpful for people stuck in a rut when it comes to learned helplessness. While it may initially feel hard to escape, with the proper time and help, it can get better.

==Extensions==
Cognitive scientist and usability engineer Donald Norman used learned helplessness to explain why people blame themselves when they have a difficult time using simple objects in their environment.

The U.S. sociologist Harrison White has suggested in his book &quot;Identity and Control&quot; that the notion of learned helplessness can be extended beyond psychology into the realm of social action. When a culture or political identity fails to achieve desired goals, perceptions of collective ability suffer.

== Emergence in the political atmosphere ==
In a political setting, learned helplessness is involved when a voter votes for a candidate and that candidate does not win. If this happens over time, it can lead to learned helplessness. When this does occur, it can often lead to having fewer voters in the future. However, Wollman &amp; Stouder (1991) found that there was not a significant finding between situation-specific efficacy and predictive behavior of voting.

==Emergence under torture==
Studies on learned helplessness served as the basis for developing American torture methods. In CIA interrogation manuals, learned helplessness is characterized as &quot;apathy&quot; which may result from prolonged use of coercive techniques which result in a &quot;debility-dependency-dread&quot; state in the subject, &quot;If the debility-dependency-dread state is unduly prolonged, however, the arrestee may sink into a defensive apathy from which it is hard to arouse him.&quot;

<text>Kimberley John Hughes (born 26 January 1954) is a former cricketer who played for Western Australia, Natal and Australia. He captained Australia in 28 Test matches between 1979 and 1984 before captaining a rebel Australian team in a tour of South Africa, a country which at the time was subject to a sporting boycott opposing apartheid.

A right-handed batsman, Hughes was seen to possess an orthodox and attractive batting style. He was identified as a potential Test cricketer from an early age, but his impetuous style of batting, and personality clashes with influential teammates and opponents such as Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh, saw a later introduction to first-class and Test cricket than anticipated. During the split between the establishment Australian Cricket Board and the breakaway World Series Cricket, Hughes stayed with the establishment.

Hughes&#x27; captaincy record with Australia was hindered by a succession of matches being played away from home (just eight of his 28 Tests while captain were played in Australia) and the necessity to rebuild an inexperienced team after the frequent absence, and later the retirement, of several senior players. Placed under extreme pressure by the media and former teammates during a series of losses to the then dominant cricket team in the world, West Indies, Hughes resigned from the captaincy, making an emotional and tearful speech. He finished his career playing cricket in South Africa.

After his playing career, Hughes for a time acted as the chairman of selectors for the Western Australian Cricket Association, and is an occasional commentator for ABC Radio&#x27;s cricket coverage.

==Early life==
Hughes was born on 26 January 1954, at Margaret River, Western Australia, the first child of father Stan, a school teacher, and mother Ruth. The Hughes family lived in nearby Kudardup, where Stan was in charge of the one-teacher school. Stan&#x27;s profession would take the Hughes family across much of the south-west of Western Australia, including postings at Ballidu, Pinjarra and Geraldton. The Hughes family settled in the Geraldton suburb of Wonthella and Hughes attended the local Allendale Primary School, where his father was the headmaster.

In Geraldton, the young Hughes played a variety of sports, including hockey, tennis and especially Australian rules football. His boyhood hero was Austin Robertson, Jr. who played for Subiaco Football Club, the club that Hughes&#x27; father had played for as a young man. His first organised cricket was as an 11-year old, filling in for the Bluff Point Cricket Club under-16 side. Aged 11, he was selected for a Geraldton under-16 representative side to compete in the junior &quot;Country Week&quot; tournament in the state capital of Perth, where his teammates included Geoff Gallop, later Premier of Western Australia. He was selected in the Geraldton Country Week team again the following year. It was at this tournament that Hughes&#x27; performances playing against much older boys saw him come to the attention of cricket administrators.

After Hughes finished primary school, the family moved to Perth. Hughes attended City Beach High School and played cricket for the Floreat Park (now Floreat) Under-16 side. In his final season at junior level Hughes scored 555 runs at an average of 46 and took 28 wickets at an average of 6, and was included in the Western Australia Colts squad. The next season, aged 15, Hughes made his first grade debut for Subiaco-Floreat Cricket Club, captained by former Test player Des Hoare; Hughes made 36 runs. In January 1970, Hughes was selected to play for Western Australia in the national under-19 carnival. His captain, Ric Charlesworth, later described Hughes as &quot;the most gifted junior cricketer I ever saw. No one else comes close.&quot; Later that season Hughes made his first century in first grade cricket, against Midland-Guildford; he finished the season topping the club batting averages.

==Cricket career==

===Club cricket and first-class debut===

After only nine first grade games, in 1970–71 Hughes was included in the Western Australian Sheffield Shield squad. Described at the time by Test wicket-keeper Rod Marsh as &quot;a technically perfect batsman&quot;, the Perth press speculated he might even make his first-class cricket debut later that season. Instead, Hughes suffered from the &quot;second-year blues&quot; and struggled for runs, averaging only 23 for the season. He was unable to break out of the slump for the next two seasons, finding himself out of the state squad. During this time he managed to retain selection in the state colts team, in one match against the Victorian colts scoring a dashing 97 before being caught on the boundary attempting to make his century from a six. It would be four years after his maiden first grade century that Hughes would make his second, against North Perth.

In 1973–74, Hughes was called up to the Western Australian squad. He acted as twelfth man in three successive matches, but was unable to break into the playing XI due to the strong Western Australian batting line-up. Impatient to play at first-class level, Hughes left for Adelaide mid-season to try his luck at gaining selection for South Australia, whose batting was not as strong. He played for East Torrens Cricket Club and awaited an invitation to play for South Australia; he was not even invited to train with the state squad. His South Australian experiment unsuccessful, Hughes—disappointed and homesick—returned to Western Australia.

Hughes was captain-coach of North Perth Cricket Club for the 1975–76 season. He finally broke into the Western Australian team in November 1975, making his first-class debut against New South Wales at the WACA Ground. In an innings described by New South Wales bowler Dave Hourn as the &quot;best and most dynamic innings&quot; he had seen in first-class cricket, Hughes continually stepped down the pitch to hit the bowling, even to the pace bowling of Len Pascoe. He was dismissed for 119, ending a partnership of 205 runs with Rob Langer. He was the fifth Western Australian batsman to make a century on first-class debut for the state. Later that season, Hughes scored a second century, against Clive Lloyd&#x27;s touring West Indians. In his first season for Western Australia, Hughes made 494 runs at an average of 32.93.

In the winter of 1976, Hughes played as a professional for Watsonians Cricket Club, a team based around former students of George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh. Hughes would later call this period &quot;possibly the best six months of my life.&quot;

===Test debut===
Playing for Western Australia against the touring Pakistan team in December 1976, Hughes made 137 runs from only 167 balls, making a claim to the attention of the national selectors. &quot;The Australian&quot; reported that &quot;[r]arely has a batsman of his limited experience been seen in a more majestic performance&quot;. A few weeks later, Hughes was called up as twelfth man for Australia in the New Year&#x27;s Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Substituting on the field for Ian Davis, he injured his shoulder attempting to catch Imran Khan. Missing the rest of the Pakistan matches, Hughes was included in the Australian team to tour New Zealand. Hughes, again suffering from homesickness, did not play in either of the two Tests.

Four weeks after marrying his girlfriend, Hughes left for England as a member of the 1977 Australian team. The tour was an unhappy one for the Australian team, losing the series three Tests to nil to England and the embryonic World Series Cricket concept caused rifts between the team members. Hughes did not play much cricket early in the tour; &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; saying that he was &quot;kept in such idleness that [he] might have claimed restraint of trade.&quot; He was selected to make his Test debut in the fifth Test, after the series had already been decided. Hughes, bitter about his treatment by the tour selectors, was unhappy. Hughes told a reporter congratulating him about his upcoming Test debut &quot;Those pricks, know they have made me part of their failure&quot;. In an uncharacteristic performance, Hughes faced thirty-four deliveries before he made his first run. It was the only run he made that innings, before he was dismissed by Mike Hendrick. Hughes&#x27; teammate Geoff Dymock later said, &quot;They threw [Hughes] to the wolves.&quot;

===World Series Cricket years===
World Series Cricket (WSC) divided the Australian team into two camps; those who had signed lucrative contracts with Kerry Packer&#x27;s rebel group and those, like Hughes, who had remained with the establishment Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Hughes&#x27; boyhood idol, Austin Robertson Jr, acted as Packer&#x27;s agent, signing players to the new cricket venture, eventually signing 13 of the 17 players who toured England; Hughes was a notable omission. Robertson claims that he did not approach Hughes about a WSC contract; Hughes claims that he was approached but indicated his unwillingness. In September 1977, Hughes made clear his attachment to traditional cricket in a statement. 

The first season of the divide saw the ACB bring the 41-year-old Bob Simpson out of retirement to captain the Australians against the touring Indians. Hughes fell one run short of a century against the tourists for Western Australia, but missed out on selection for the first Test at the Gabba in Brisbane; instead he was named as twelfth man. Hughes was chosen for the second Test at the WACA Ground in Perth, where he made 28 in the first innings and a duck in the second. He was omitted for the third Test in Melbourne, but returned for the fourth Test in Sydney. At the Sydney Cricket Ground Hughes made 17 and 19, with Bishan Bedi dismissing him on both occasions. Again, Hughes was left out of the Australian team; at this stage he had not played two Test matches consecutively. At the end of the summer, Ian Chappell wrote Hughes &quot;is still a long way off from realising anything like that potential.&quot;

Hughes travelled to the Caribbean as a member of the Australian cricket team to play the West Indies in 1978. During the first match on tour against the Leeward Islands at Basseterre, Saint Kitts, Hughes suffered from appendicitis and had his appendix removed. The wound became infected and Hughes had to beg team management to be allowed to remain on the tour. Despite his later recovery, he did not play any of the Tests; his personality and attitude to the game did not meet with the approval of the captain, Simpson. A reporter wrote at the time, &quot;Kim Hughes is the most frustrated, disillusioned young man in the West Indies today and with good reason. [...] Never, at any stage, has Simpson considered Hughes a Test prospect.&quot;

Mike Brearley led his English team to Australia in 1978–79 on the back of his victory over the Greg Chappell-led Australians in 1977. With Simpson standing down from international cricket, Graham Yallop was the new Australian captain, leading an inexperienced Australian team, with only Gary Cosier having played over 10 Tests before the series began; Hughes had only played three Tests. The Australians were no match for the experienced England team, losing the series and the Ashes five Tests to one. Playing in all six Tests, Hughes scored 345 runs at an average of 28.75; only Yallop scored more runs in what was a poor batting performance by Australia. Hughes&#x27; only century came in the first Test at Brisbane. Having been bowled out for 116, in their first innings, Australia had lost three wickets for only 49 runs (49/3) in the second innings when Hughes joined Yallop at the crease. Yallop and Hughes scored 170 runs in partnership before Yallop was dismissed for 102. Hughes continued on and was the last Australian wicket to fall, top-scoring with 129, his maiden Test century. While England won the match by seven wickets, Hughes and Yallop at least made the Australian effort look respectable.

===A young captain===
With the Ashes series played and lost, Australia hosted Pakistan for a two-Test series at the end of the Australian 1978–79 season. Pakistan won the first Test by 71 runs after Sarfraz Nawaz took an incredible seven wickets for only one run in the Australian second innings. Before the second Test, Yallop tore his calf muscle playing for Richmond—his club side—and had to withdraw from the Australian team. Hughes, playing only his eleventh Test, was named as Australian captain; the first Western Australian to lead the national team.

Hughes took to the leadership role with enthusiasm, boasting of a &quot;new era&quot;. Bowling in the nets before the start of the third day&#x27;s play, Hughes rolled his ankle and was not able to take his place in the field. While he sat in the dressing room, the Australian team, desperate to end Pakistan&#x27;s ten-wicket partnership, &quot;Mankaded&quot; (ie, run out the batsman at the non-striker&#x27;s end in lieu of proceeding to bowl the ball) Sikander Bakht. During Australia&#x27;s second innings, Andrew Hilditch picked up the ball after a return from a fieldsman and, in an attempt to be helpful, handed it to Sarfraz. Sarfraz appealed for a handling the ball dismissal, and Hilditch was given out by umpire Tony Crafter. While within the laws of the game, both dismissals were generally seen as unsportsmanlike. Hughes said of his own team&#x27;s actions, &quot;It was just part of cricket&quot; while condemning the actions of Sarfraz: &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t cricket&quot;. In the end, Australia won the second Test and tied the series one Test apiece. Hughes had started his Australian captaincy with a win.

His success in his one Test in charge saw Hughes appointed as captain of the Australian team for the 1979 Cricket World Cup to be held in England. The Australian team was not expected to do well and lived up to those low expectations by not making the semi-finals. A Test series in India was next for Hughes and his team. In a rain-affected series, Australia was unable to win a match, losing two and drawing another four. However, &quot;Wisden&quot; had praise for Hughes, remarking that there &quot;was a marked development in Hughes&#x27;s technique of playing spin bowling&quot; and that &quot;the heavy burden of captaincy had no adverse effect on his batting&quot;. His best performance was in the first Test at Chennai (then called Madras), where he scored exactly 100 runs in the first innings, batting in a responsible fashion. Over the series, Hughes topped the aggregate and the averages for Australia, scoring 594 runs at an average of 59.40.

===Reunification===

In 1979, World Series Cricket and the Australian Cricket Board agreed to the reunification of the Australian team. Hughes—along with the other establishment players—now had to compete with the returning WSC players, not only for spots in the Australian team, but also for spots in their respective state teams as well. Many experts in the press did not include Hughes in a full-strength Australian squad and former Australian captain and Packer player, Ian Chappell agreed saying, &quot;Frankly, I can&#x27;t even see a spot in the [Australian] squad for Hughes&quot; Ultimately Hughes was included in the Australian squad, but was now vice-captain, with Greg Chappell—the captain before the split—restored to this position.

England and the West Indies both toured Australia in 1979–80. Hughes started the summer well, making 139 not out in the first Test against a West Indian line-up including bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Joel Garner. He hit 18 boundaries that innings, 10 of them from the hook shot. The next Test, against England in Perth, Hughes was out one run short of his century, attempting to hit Derek Underwood out of the ground. A short tour to play Pakistan followed in February 1980, where Hughes made 182 runs in the three-Test series, averaging 36.40.
The Centenary Test at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in August 1980 was a triumph for Hughes. Much of the first three days&#x27; play was lost due to bad weather but in that time Hughes played what &quot;Wisden&quot; would describe as &quot;two innings of the highest quality.&quot; Hughes scored a century in the first innings, 117 runs including 14 fours and 3 sixes. His second innings only totalled 84 runs before he was dismissed by Ian Botham. It was this innings, however, that was seen as his most brilliant of the match. His 84 runs included 11 fours and 2 sixes, one of which struck the top deck of the pavilion; Hughes having stepped down the pitch to hit Chris Old back over his head. Former England captain Gubby Allen could not recall a more remarkable straight hit. Cricket writer RS Whitington had to cast his mind back more than 40 years to describe Hughes&#x27; batting as &quot;the nearest approach to Stan McCabe in full flurry&quot;. The Test was drawn and Hughes was given the Man of the Match award, having batted on each of the five days of the match. His performance in the Centenary Test saw him named as one of the 1981 Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

Hughes struggled against New Zealand in 1980–81, making only 102 runs at an average of 27.25 in three Tests. Rumours about Hughes&#x27; selection prospects again began to circulate. While Hughes was batting in the traditional Australia Day Test in Adelaide, this time against India, later that summer, his nemesis Ian Chappell opined on the airwaves that &quot;Hughes really does need to build up a big score here. People are starting to talk about him being dropped.&quot; In seeming response to this criticism, Hughes scored a double-century; 213 runs including 21 boundaries. A &quot;magnificent innings&quot; &quot;Wisden&quot; declared, adding that Hughes&#x27; batting &quot;touched the heights&quot; and that &quot;[w]ith brilliant footwork, he scored freely off the spinners.&quot; Hughes dedicated his innings to his newborn twin sons, Sean and Simon.

===On-again, off-again skipper===

In 1981, Australia was scheduled to tour England to play for the Ashes. Before the squad was selected, Greg Chappell announced that he would not be leading the Australian team, citing business and family reasons. In his absence, the Australian Cricket Board turned to Hughes as captain. The Australian team arrived in England in May and was greeted by rain, leaving them short of needed match practice. Nevertheless, Hughes and his team unexpectedly won the preliminary One Day International series. The first Test was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Australia won the low scoring and rain affected match by six wickets, after Hughes had taken the opportunity to put England into bat after winning the toss. Australia then had the best of a drawn match in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s. After making a pair in this match, Ian Botham resigned his position as captain of England.

The third Test of the series was played at Headingley in Leeds. Hughes&#x27; Australians had the better of the early part of the match. Batting first, Australia made 401 runs; with Hughes contributing 89 of them. In response England only scored 174 runs and Hughes enforced the follow-on (forced to take its second batting innings immediately after its first). England were reduced to 135/7 in their second innings and the on-ground bookmakers decided to offer odds of 500–1 on an England victory. Ian Botham and Bob Willis turned the match on its head. In an extraordinary innings Botham made 149 runs, allowing England to set a target of 130 runs for Australia to win. Willis then took eight wickets for only 43 runs as Australia were all out for 111. Hughes and his Australian team had lost the match from what should have been an unbeatable position. Later, explaining what had happened, Hughes said &quot;Botham rode his luck and we couldn&#x27;t get him out. [...] In the first innings they missed catches—even Botham and [David] Gower missed them—but in the second they held everything. I&#x27;d seen Bob Willis bowl just as well at other times and not take nearly as many wickets.&quot; Australia lost the fourth Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham. This time, requiring only 151 runs to win the match, Australia reached 105/4 and seemed certain to win the match. Again, it was Botham who turned the match around, capturing 5 wickets in the space of 28 deliveries while only conceding one run. In the final Test of the series, Hughes chose to shepherd the strike to protect his partner Yallop, who was a specialist batsman. This action, something normally only done for poor, tail-end batsmen, humiliated Yallop. England won the series three Tests to one and retained the Ashes. The series was later known as &quot;Botham&#x27;s summer.&quot;

With Chappell again available, Hughes returned to the vice-captaincy for the 1981–82 Tests. Australia played Pakistan first in an ill-tempered three Test series; won by the Australians two Tests to one. Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered the best team in the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling. In an interview later he said &quot;that to hang around and defend was going to be a waste of time ... So I thought what I could do was try to play as many shots as possible.&quot; When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes&#x27; remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; it had taken him nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn&#x27;t give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes&#x27; innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said &quot;He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don&#x27;t find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion. That was just his day.&quot; The Wisden 100, a ranking of the &quot;Top 100 Test Innings of all time&quot;, ranked that innings as number nine.

===Last days of the Chappell era===
In three Tests, Hughes scored only 29 runs on tour in New Zealand in March 1982. Greg Chappell withdrew from the Australian team to tour Pakistan in 1982, along with Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe. The fourteen Australian Cricket Board delegates met in March to decide on an interim captain for the tour, with the two candidates Hughes and Rod Marsh. Hughes narrowly won the vote, 8 votes to 6. Marsh was offered the vice-captaincy, which he declined. Marsh arrived late for the tour as a result of his son&#x27;s illness. It was a difficult tour for Hughes&#x27; Australians. All members of the touring squad suffered from illness at one stage and at one stage Hughes threatened to take his team back to Australia after several Australian fielders were hit by projectiles thrown from the stands. Intelligent bowling by Pakistan&#x27;s Abdul Qadir combined with poor fielding and lack of depth in Australia&#x27;s batting saw Pakistan defeat Australia three Tests to nil.

Hughes had hoped to retain the captaincy for the Ashes series in 1982–83, but the ACB chose to restore Chappell to his former position. Hughes&#x27; demotion did not affect his batting, however. He scored 469 runs against the English at an average of 67.00. His consistent run scoring saw Bill O&#x27;Reilly call Hughes &quot;Mr. Reliable&quot; and even Ian Chappell remarked that &quot;After this series, not only should Hughes&#x27; conscience be clear but his slate clean in regard to the 1981 [Ashes] disaster.&quot; The highlight of the summer for Hughes was the final Test in Sydney where he batted for over 6 hours to score 137 runs. Australia retrieved the Ashes, winning the series two Tests to one. Not long after the match, Chappell relinquished his position as Australian captain; Hughes was now captain of a full-strength Australian team for the first time.

Australia did not make it out of the group stage in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, winning only two of their six matches played. Hughes&#x27; team was embarrassed by a loss in their first match against Zimbabwe, at the time a mainly amateur side. There was a chance that Australia could still make the semi-finals with a win against India. Hughes chose to sit out the match, to give a minor injury time to heal. In his absence the Australian team was dismissed for 129 and bundled out of the tournament. Hughes decision to pull out of the match drew some criticism from the Australian press: &quot;Hughes decision not to play was lamentable [...] this Australian team does not have a capable leader.&quot; On his return to Australia, David Hookes publicly advocated for Rod Marsh to be appointed Australian captain in Hughes&#x27; place, saying on Adelaide radio, &quot;Maybe Kim has got to be an apprentice to someone everyone respects.&quot; Hughes replied &#x27;It&#x27;s nice to know the Australian captain has got the support of his vice-captain.&quot; Under some pressure from cricket officials, Hughes was persuaded that he should stand down from the captaincy and a letter was drafted to this effect; he changed his mind the following morning.

Once again, the Australian Cricket Board voted 8–6 to appoint Hughes as captain for the 1983–84 series against Pakistan. This time Hughes led a full strength Australian team, including former captain Greg Chappell and his fellow Western Australians, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh. Hughes&#x27; Australians defeated Pakistan comfortably, two Tests to nil. Hughes himself scored 375 runs in the series, including one century at Adelaide where he &quot;confounded the cunning Qadir&quot;. At the end the season, Chappell, Lillee and Marsh—the Australian team&#x27;s most experienced players—retired from international cricket.

===Downfall===
Australia was scheduled to tour the West Indies in 1984. The players selected for the tour were presented with official contracts by the Australian Cricket Board. The contracts sought to bind the players to only play in ACB approved cricket for a period of twelve months after the expiry of the tour, without offering any additional compensation. To the dismay of the Board, Hughes stood by his team and with his lawyer drafted a compromise agreement that gave the players some financial security. The West Indies was commonly regarded at that times as the best team in the world and Hughes&#x27; new-look Australian team now had to take them on without the recently retired Marsh, Lillee and Chappell. Bob Simpson commented, &quot;The saddest and hardest lot for any captain is taking over the remnants of a once-great team. I wouldn&#x27;t be in Hughes&#x27; shoes for quids.&quot; In addition, the Australian team was badly affected by injury; Yallop withdrew with a knee injury and Kepler Wessels, Graeme Wood, Steve Smith, Rodney Hogg and Carl Rackemann all were unfit to play at times during the tour.

Australia lost the series three Tests to nil. After managing to draw the first two Tests, they lost the next three; the West Indies did not lose a second innings wicket all tour. Hughes did not have a successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not care less about the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.

Hughes then enjoyed a rare overseas captaincy triumph, leading Australia to a 3–0 victory in a one day series against India. However there was no extended respite for the Australians; the West Indies returned to Australia for the 1984–85 season. The Australian team remained positive; Allan Border said, &quot;We are thinking of beating them, Laugh all you want.&quot; Despite this attitude, the Australians lost the first Test by an innings and 112 runs. Hughes made only four runs in the first innings, out
playing the hook shot despite a pre-series pledge not to play the stroke. Again, the pressure from the media came; Ian Chappell used his newspaper column to heavily criticise Hughes. Chappell continued his criticism of Hughes during the standard pre-match interview before the broadcast of the second Test in Brisbane. The Test was another struggle for the Australians. Australia was bowled out for 175 and Hughes then dropped two catches in the West Indian innings. In the Australian second innings, Hughes made only four. The next morning, before play, Hughes rang the Australia team manager and said &quot;I want to quit as Australian captain.&quot;

===Relinquishing the captaincy===
With assistance from Greg Chappell, Hughes wrote his letter of resignation. During the day&#x27;s play, Hughes confided in his teammates, announcing his decision. Allan Border, his vice-captain, advised him to reconsider; Hughes refused. At the press conference at the end of the day&#x27;s play, Hughes announced, &quot;I have something to read.&quot; Hughes was visibly emotional while reading his letter and broke down in tears halfway through, leaving the rest for team manager Bob Merriman to read on his behalf as he quickly left the press conference. Australia went on to lose the match by eight wickets, with Hughes scoring 34 and 4.

Press reaction to Hughes&#x27; resignation and his emotional state was mixed. Former Australian captain and television broadcaster Bill Lawry said &quot;The demise of Kim Hughes in Brisbane in a manner equal to be being dragged down like a dingo in the pack and devoured by your own, within and without, was a disgrace.&quot; The respected ABC radio broadcaster Alan McGilvray on the other hand was more blunt: &quot;[Hughes] is a little boy who has not yet grown up.&quot; Hughes was widely mocked for his tears, which were seen as unmanly and un-Australian. Barry Humphries—the satirist behind Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson—wondered if &quot;Kim&#x27;s cricket box was on too tight&quot; and claimed that a real Australian in that situation &quot;would simply chunder&quot;. In 2002, a British journalist remarked of Hughes&#x27; tears as &quot;one inadequate captain getting life so out of proportion as to make a complete clown of himself.&quot; It is claimed in the press from time to time that Hughes is now as much remembered for his tears as for his achievements in cricket.

Hughes retained his place in the Australian team for the third Test in Adelaide under new captain, Allan Border. Hughes failed in both innings, scoring a duck in the first innings and only two runs in the second. Hughes joined the Australian team in Melbourne for the fourth Test. Despite warm support from the MCG crowd, Hughes made a humiliating pair; in his last innings he was out from the first ball he faced—a golden duck. He never played in a Test match again. He played in some of the remaining One Day Internationals but without success. When the Australian team was chosen for the tour of England in 1985, Hughes was not included.

===Rebel and retirement===
While the Australian team for England was being selected, the South African Cricket Union (SACU) was arranging a &quot;rebel&quot; Australian team to tour South Africa. As a result of the apartheid policy of the white minority government, South Africa was cast out of the International Cricket Council and subjected to a boycott. With his old adversaries Greg Chappell as a national selector and Rod Marsh playing an analogous role for the Western Australian team, Hughes felt that his options in Australian cricket were limited and he chose to join the rebel team as the captain. Hughes was one of the last players to join the rebel team; indeed he found out that many of the rebel squad had signed up with the South Africans during the 1983 World Cup, when he was confirmed as captain. At a press conference after the announcement of the team, Hughes announced: Hughes was heavily criticised for his decision. Desmond Tutu called him a hypocrite and Prime Minister Bob Hawke called him a comforter of racists. The criticism was hurtful to Hughes who, seemingly puzzled, remarked to friends &quot;People think I&#x27;m a racist.&quot; In South Africa, even before his team arrived Hughes was &quot;a hero, larger than a Reagan ... [Australia&#x27;s] most exotic export since Breaker Morant.&quot;

The rebel team played two series against the South African team—in 1985–86 and 1986–87—and lost them both 1 &quot;Test&quot; to nil. In the first series, Hughes left himself stranded on 97 when the second &quot;Test&quot; at Newlands in Cape Town ended in a draw. In the following match at Wanderers in Johannesburg, Hughes was dismissed for a king pair; dismissed by first ball he faced in both innings. Hughes scored 585 runs at an average of 45.00 in the 1985–86 South African season and followed that with 596 runs at an average of 42.57 in 1986–87. In 2007, Hughes reflected on his participation in the rebel tours: &quot;Cricket was at the forefront of trying to break down barriers and when you look how cricket has developed in South Africa I was very pleased to be involved.&quot;

Following the rebel tours, Hughes returned to Western Australia. The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to ban him from club cricket in Western Australia. In response Hughes took action against the WACA for restraint of trade; he won the case in the Federal Court of Australia—the WACA lost several hundred thousand dollars in court costs. Before the start of the 1987–88 season, Marsh resigned his position as a Western Australian selector; by December Hughes had made his way back into the Western Australian team as an opener, where he scored 76 runs against New South Wales. He played six matches for Western Australia that year scoring 223 runs at an average of 22.30. The following season Hughes played only two games for Western Australia, with the state side finding little room for a man now aged 34.

In September 1989, Hughes signed on as captain of Natal in the South African Currie Cup competition. His two seasons with Natal were disappointing for the team and himself; Natal struggled on the field and there was disharmony amongst the squad. With the bat he scored 176 runs at an average of 13.53 in 1989–90 and 266 at 24.16 in 1990–91. He did, however, have a positive influence on two cricketers who later represented South Africa. Andrew Hudson claimed that &quot;Kim installed a positiveness and a self-belief&quot; in him and Jonty Rhodes—who stayed in Hughes&#x27; home during Natal home matches—wanted to play with the same passion as Hughes: &quot;There are too many robots ... Kim was emotional because he cared. I wanted to be the same.&quot; During his second season at Natal, Hughes was dropped from the Natal side and later was dropped from the Natal &quot;B&quot; side. He retired from all first-class cricket in February 1991.

==Off the field==

===Personal life===
After finishing high school, Hughes attended Graylands Teachers College to train as a primary school teacher. Graylands was established as a stop-gap measure but by the time Hughes arrived it had been operating for two decades and the facilities were run down and almost derelict. In 1974, his final year at Graylands, Hughes was elected President of the student council and in this role he led a campaign to improve the facilities for the faculty and students. The campaign, which included an appearance by Hughes on the ABC television current affairs program This Day Tonight, met with some measure of success.

His first job as a teacher was at Linden Park Primary School in Linden Park during his attempt to make the South Australian team in 1974. After teaching, he found employment in the finance industry, working first for City Building Society as a promotions manager and later for Town &amp; Country Building Society in a marketing role. Town &amp; Country used Hughes to promote their business both in advertising and in through direct contact with investors. In return, Hughes was afforded time away from work to pursue cricket. The General Manager of Town &amp; Country described the relationship: &quot;[Hughes] was a great player, well presented, good looking. He was a family man. He fitted the Town &amp; Country mould admirably.&quot;

Hughes was a skilled Australian rules footballer as a junior and was invited to play with the Claremont Football Club in the West Australian National Football League. He played two seasons at Claremont—1973 and 1974—alternating between the under-21 and the reserve teams, but did not manage to make the senior team. The Claremont coach, Verdun Howell, described Hughes as having &quot;Great ball skills, brilliant hand-eye coordination and a very, very reliable kick [...] And he showed courage. He went full throttle at the ball and didn&#x27;t look for a second option.&quot; Howell told Hughes one evening at practice, &quot;I believe you could go as far as you want in football.&quot; Hughes played at full forward for the under-21 team and mainly in the centre in the reserves. His brief football career was interrupted by injury—he broke his neck falling off a desk at teachers college—and eventually he advised Howell that he was &quot;very much looking towards cricket&quot; in future.

Hughes was aged 14 when he met Jenny Davidson, a fellow student at City Beach High School. The pair married in March 1977 and within four weeks Hughes left for a four-month tour of England. In January 1981, Jenny gave birth to twins. Another son and a daughter followed. Kim&#x27;s brother Glenn played first-class cricket for Orange Free State and Tasmania.

Since retirement Hughes has been chairman of selectors for the Western Australian Cricket Association from 1999 to 2000 and more recently an occasional cricket commentator on ABC radio. He was Head of Cricket at Hale School, in Wembley Downs, Perth. A dining room at the WACA Ground is named the Kim Hughes Room.

===Style and personality===

Hughes batted with an orthodox upright, side-on stance. He gripped the bat high on the handle and played his strokes with a controlled backlift and a full follow through. He got his body well behind the ball in defence but early in his innings tended to move around the crease in front of his stumps, leaving him vulnerable to a leg before wicket dismissal.

Hughes was widely considered by those who knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted to be liked. He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, &quot;The one thing in my favour is that I will never change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person.&quot; His biographer noted, &quot;[F]riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim&#x27;s niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people&#x27;s best friend.&quot; As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said &quot;Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [Hughes] never stopped being softly obliging.&quot; The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, &quot;He was almost too amenable, too nice a guy. He was great with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn&#x27;t have the appropriate personality [to be captain].&quot;

Hughes projected a confident image on the field. &quot;A pretty cocky little fella&quot; was how one early opponent in club cricket described Hughes. This cockiness pleased some but others like Bruce Duperouzel, Hughes&#x27;s captain in a Western Australian colts team, thought that Hughes had &quot;an extravagance that pushed the bounds of acceptability.&quot;

Fond of noting that he was born on Australia Day, Hughes was proudly Australian and keen to demonstrate this publicly. On his first tour to England, Hughes was often the only team member wearing the Australian team blazer. Hughes claimed that &quot;the greatest day of [his] life&quot; was &quot;Australia II&quot;&#x27;s victory over the New York Yacht Club&#x27;s entry in the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup yacht race; Hughes sat down with his twin sons, waved mini-Australian flags purchased especially for the event and watched a replay of the race twice more that day.

Hughes&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Claggy&quot;, a reference to the ubiquitous Clag glue found in classrooms across Australia.

<doc id="471583" wikidata="Q506060" url="?curid=471583" title="Vladislaus III, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Vladislaus Henry (; – 12 August 1222), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was elected Duke of Bohemia (as &quot;Vladislaus III&quot;) in 1197 and Margrave of Moravia from 1197 until his death. He only served as duke during the year 1197 and was indeed the last ruler of Bohemia to hold that title. It was his brother Ottokar I, whose forces overthrew him, who finally achieved the elevation of the Duchy of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom starting in 1198.

==Early life==
Vladislaus Henry was the second son of Duke Vladislaus II from his second marriage with Judith of Thuringia, thereby the younger brother of Ottokar I. He grew up during a frivolous time, for the complex personal relationship his father had with the emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, was leading to a tragic termination. During the late 12th century struggles within the Přemyslid dynasty, he supported his older brother Ottokar when he seized the Bohemian duchy in 1192. In turn, Ottokar appointed Vladislaus, Prince of Brno and Znojmo since 1191, a margrave of Moravia with the consent of Emperor Henry VI. However, the two never paid the demanded sum and so were again deposed in June 1193 by a decision of the Imperial Diet at Worms, which appointed their cousin, the Prague bishop Henry Bretislaus, as duke. Vladislaus was summoned to Prague Castle, where he had to spend the following years suspiciously eyed by Duke Bretislaus.

==Reign==
After the death of Emperor Henry VI and Bretislaus in 1197, Vladislaus was released and elected duke on 22 June 1197, with his brother in attendance. Faced with an uprising in favour of Ottokar, Vladislaus abdicated a few months later, on 6 December. The brothers then very nearly came to war, but, their armies encamped facing each other, the two met and negotiated a solution whereby Ottokar took the Bohemian throne–though without imperial approval–and compensated Vladislaus with the hereditary margravial title of near-autonomous Moravia. By his repudiation of the throne, Vladislaus helped to bring an end to the destructive dynastic wars of the Přemyslids, which had lasted for over twenty-five years from the death of his father. His status as a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire was acknowledged in the 1212 Golden Bull of Sicily.

Vladislaus held Moravia until his death twenty five years thence, in close co-operation with his brother. He reinforced his rule, when he had the rivalling claimant Prince Spytihněv III of Brno blinded and installed his own confessor, Daniel Milík, as Bishop of Prague, the first investiture by a reigning prince in Bohemia. Daniel played a vital role in the reconciliation between Vladislaus and Ottokar; despite several protests to the Roman Curia, he held the see until 1214 without receiving imperial nomination. In 1205, Vladislaus founded the Cistercian abbey of Velehrad as a family monastery and burial ground of the Moravian margraves.

Vladislaus was married with one Heilwida (Hedwig), of unknown origin. He died without issue at his court in Znojmo, whereafter the Moravian margraviate fell back to King Ottokar I, who enfeoffed it to his younger son Vladislaus II. Vladislaus was buried at Velehrad Abbey.

<doc id="471589" wikidata="Q7613243" url="?curid=471589" title="Steve Maharey">
<text>Steven Maharey (born 3 February 1953) is a New Zealand academic and former politician of the Labour Party. Elected to Parliament for the first time in 1990, he was Minister of Social Development and Employment from 1999 to 2005 and Minister of Education from 2005 to 2007. He retired from Parliament at the 2008 general election to become the Vice-Chancellor at Massey University.

==Early life==
Maharey was born in Palmerston North in 1953, the son of William Maharey and his wife Irene. He attended Freyberg High School in 1966–1969. After gaining an MA Hons in sociology from Palmerston North&#x27;s Massey University (1972–1976), he was a lecturer at that institution from 1978, teaching both sociology and business administration. His particular specialties within sociology were social change and cultural studies.

==Political career==
===Palmerston North City Council===
Maharey served one term on the Palmerston North City Council from 1986 to 1989.

===In opposition, 1990–1999===


In the 1990 election, Maharey stood as the Labour Party candidate for Palmerston North, replacing retiring MP Trevor de Cleene, and was elected to Parliament. After Maharey left the Labour party, Iain Lees-Galloway successfully held the seat for Labour in the 2008 election. He was a subscriber of Third Way political thinking.

Maharey immediately became Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for broadcasting and communications under Mike Moore. He later gained associate responsibility for education. In 1993, he instead became spokesperson for labour and employment. In 1994 he was promoted to a seat on the frontbench to replace Peter Dunne, who had quit the party. In a 1997 reshuffle he relinquished the labour portfolio and instead became spokesperson on social welfare.

===In Government, 1999–2008===
After the 1999 election, a Labour-Alliance government was formed, Maharey became Minister of Social Services and Employment, having responsibility for social welfare, youth services, and the reduction of unemployment. In 2002 the title changed to Minister for Social Development and Employment. He also became Associate Minister of Education responsible for tertiary education. After the 2002 election, in which Labour was re-elected, Maharey also became Minister of Broadcasting. In a December 2004 cabinet reshuffle, Maharey was promoted to Minister of Education, Minister for Research, Science and Technology, Minister for Crown Research Institutes, and Minister for Youth Affairs. He was officially ranked fourth in the Cabinet hierarchy.

While former colleague John Tamihere described Maharey as &#x27;smarmy&#x27; in an &quot;Investigate&quot; magazine interview, Maharey&#x27;s personality publicly surfaced during the Christine Rankin Employment Court Hearing in 2001, where Rankin (a former head of Maharey&#x27;s department whose contract was not renewed) and Maharey publicly exchanged insults. &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; quoted several exchanges between the two that were alleged to have occurred by Rankin. The court did not uphold Rankin&#x27;s claims.

In April 2007, Maharey came under criticism for saying &#x27;fuck you&#x27; in parliamentary question time on 4 April. He apologised shortly afterwards. The outburst was elicited when Maharey was questioned by Jonathan Coleman about the appropriateness of his actions as broadcasting minister threatening to complain to the Radio New Zealand board when he was displeased by a host Sean Plunket referring to a comment Maharey had made about the need for the Cambridge exam in Botswana as &#x27;racist.&#x27;

Maharey stood down from his ministerial roles in October 2007, pending his appointment as Vice-Chancellor of Massey University. In the 2009 New Year Honours, Maharey was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services as a Member of Parliament.

== Roles after Parliament ==
===Massey University===
From 2008 until 2016, Steve Maharey was the Vice-Chancellor of Massey University. During Maharey&#x27;s eight years as Vice-Chancellor, total staff numbers (FTE) increased from 3,080 in 2009, his first full year as Vice-Chancellor, to 3,213 in 2016, his last year in the role. However, over the same time period academic staff numbers remained much the same. Student numbers (EFTS) decreased from 19,994 in 2009 to 18,994 in 2016 due to a reduction in domestic students, including extramural students, partly offset by an increase in international students. Māori enrolments also decreased from 3,548 to 3338 students during this period. Over the same period, the university&#x27;s consolidated revenues increased from $406 million to $489 million and net assets increased from $924 million to approximately $1 billion. However, external research income decreased from $70 million in 2009 to $67 million in 2016.

In 2022, Maharey was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by Massey University.

===Pharmac &amp; ACC===
In August 2018, Maharey became the chair of the Board of Pharmac. During this period Pharmac underwent a period of change following a critical review. In April 2021, he became Chair of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).

In March 2023, Maharey attracted media attention after the Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes ruled that two of his op-ed columns published in the &quot;Sunday Star Times&quot; breached public servants&#x27; rules for impartiality. Since Maharey&#x27;s actions were deemed to be at the &quot;lower end of the spectrum,&quot; Prime Minister Chris Hipkins ruled that Maharey would retain his positions as the Chair of Pharmac, ACC, and Education New Zealand.

Maharey resigned from Pharmac and ACC on 1 December 2023 after the formation of a National-led coalition government following the 2023 New Zealand general election.

<doc id="471593" wikidata="Q235906" url="?curid=471593" title="Coat of arms of Burkina Faso">
<text>The [[coat of arms]] of [[Burkina Faso]] contains a shield based on the national flag. Above the shield the name of the country is shown, while below it is the national motto, &quot;Unité, Progrès, Justice&quot; (French for &quot;Unity, Progress, Justice&quot;). The supporters are two white stallions. The two plants emerging from the lower banner appear to represent pearl millet, an important cereal grain cultivated in this country where agriculture represents 32% of the gross domestic product. This coat of arms is similar to the old Upper Volta coat of arms (see below), with the Burkina Faso flag replacing the Upper Volta flag in the middle. The coat of arms and its meaning is mandated by Law No 020/97/II/AN.

== Official blazon ==

* one escutcheon bearing in the chief on a ribband argent the name of the country: &quot;BURKINA FASO&quot;;
* in fess point an inescutcheon of two bands in fess with the banner of arms, sewn upon two crossed spears;
* two stallions rampant argent supporting on each side the escutcheon;
* in base, an open book;
* below, two stalks of millet with three pairs of green leaves in crescent coming from the bottom, and equidistant to the vertical passing through the points of the shield and the upper ray of the star of the flag, crossed and connected in their bases with a ribbon bearing the motto of the country &quot;Unité - Progrès - Justice&quot;.

==Historic emblem (1984–1997)==

Thomas Sankara&#x27;s 1983–1987 Burkinabé revolution implemented an emblem featuring a crossed daba (a traditional Burkinabé agricultural tool) and AK-47 (an allusion to the Hammer and Sickle), with the motto &quot;La Patrie ou la Mort, nous vaincrons&quot; (&quot;Fatherland or death, we shall overcome&quot;&#x27;).

==Coat of arms of Upper Volta==

This somewhat resembles the current emblem, except that the enclosing shield has a blue background, the inescutcheon is based on the flag of Upper Volta with the superimposed letters &quot;RHV&quot; (for &quot;République de Haute-Volta&quot;), and the motto was &quot;Unité, Travail, Justice&quot; (&quot;Unity, Labour, Justice&quot;).

<doc id="471600" wikidata="Q1752649" url="?curid=471600" title="Total institution">
<text>A total institution or residential institution is a residential facility where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life. Privacy and civil liberties are limited or non-existent in total institutions, as all aspects of life including sleep, play, and work, are conducted in the same place. The concept is mostly associated with the work of sociologist Erving Goffman.

Characteristics of total institutions usually include at least a few of the following

* Strict limitations on personal property or an outright confiscation of personal possessions with the exception of certain medical devices like eyeglasses
(most common in prisons and mental hospitals, other types of residential institutions typically allow more personal property)

* Uniforms and\or dress codes (especially in prisons, boarding schools and military bases)

* A certain degree of dehumanization

* Scheduling covering and organizing every minute of the day

* Ridged authoritarian hierarchy

* Stringent rules

* Cell or barracks/dorm type housing where multiple people sleep in each bedroom (in boarding schools, ships, remote work camps\outposts, military bases and some prisons)

* Communal meals in dining halls, recreation, etc

==Etymology==

The term is sometimes credited as having been coined and defined by Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman in his paper &quot;On the Characteristics of Total Institutions&quot;, presented in April 1957 at the Walter Reed Institute&#x27;s Symposium on Preventive and Social Psychiatry. An expanded version appeared in Donald Cressey&#x27;s collection, &quot;The Prison&quot;, and was reprinted in Goffman&#x27;s 1961 collection, &quot;Asylums&quot;. Fine and Manning, however, note that Goffman heard the term in lectures by Everett Hughes (likely during the late-1940s seminar, &quot;Work and Occupations&quot;). Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term, he can be credited with popularizing it.

==Typology==

Total institutions are divided by Goffman into five different types:
# institutions established to care for people felt to be both harmless and incapable: orphanages, poor houses, most types of group homes and nursing homes.
# places established to care for people felt to be incapable of looking after themselves and a threat to the community, albeit an unintended one: leprosariums, mental hospitals, certain types of group homes, and tuberculosis sanitariums.
# institutions organised to protect the community against what are felt to be intentional dangers to it, with the welfare of the people thus sequestered not the immediate issue: concentration camps, P.O.W. camps, penitentiaries, and jails.
# institutions purportedly established to better pursue some worklike tasks and justifying themselves only on these instrumental grounds: colonial compounds, work camps, boarding schools, ships, army barracks, and large mansions from the point of view of those who live in the servants&#x27; quarters.
# establishments designed as retreats from the world even while often serving also as training stations for the religious; examples are convents, abbeys, monasteries, and other cloisters.
David Rothman states that &quot;historians have confirmed the validity of Goffman&#x27;s concept of &#x27;total institutions&#x27; which minimizes the differences in formal mission to establish a unity of design and structure.&quot;

In &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, Michel Foucault discussed total institutions in the language of &quot;complete and austere institutions&quot;.

===Nursing homes===

According to S. Lammers and A. Verhey, some 80 percent of Americans will ultimately die not in their home, but in a total institution.

===Tourism===

Sociologists have pointed out that tourist venues, such as cruise ships, are acquiring many of the characteristics of total institutions. Tourists may not be aware that they are being controlled, even constrained, but the environment has been designed to subtly manipulate the behavior of patrons. These examples differ from the traditional examples in that the influence is short term.

===Spaceship Earth===

Sociologist Steffen Roth has demonstrated that, if realized, Spaceship Earth would epitomise the most total institution ever created in human history.

<text>A state school, public school, or government school is a primary or secondary school that educates all students without charge. They are funded in whole or in part by taxation and operated by the government of the state. State-funded schools are global with each country showcasing distinct structures and curricula. Government-funded education spans from primary to secondary levels, covering ages 4 to 18. Alternatives to this system include homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and other educational options.

==By region and country==
=== Africa ===
==== South Africa ====

In South Africa, a state school or government school refers to a school that is state-controlled. These are officially called public schools according to the South African Schools Act of 1996, but it is a term that is not used colloquially. The Act recognised two categories of schools: public and independent. Independent schools include all private schools and schools that are privately governed. Independent schools with low tuition fees are state-aided and receive a subsidy on a sliding-scale. Traditional private schools that charge high fees receive no state subsidy. State schools are all state-owned, including section 21 schools, formerly referred to as &quot;model C&quot; or semi-private schools, that have a governing body and a degree of budget autonomy, as these are still fully owned and accountable to the state.

===Americas===
====Canada====

Under the Canadian constitution, public-school education in Canada is a provincial responsibility and, as such, there are many variations among the provinces. Junior kindergarten or equivalent exists as an official program in Ontario and Quebec while kindergarten or equivalent is available in every province, but provincial funding and the level of hours provided varies widely. Starting at grade one, at about age six, there is universal Crown-funded access up to grade twelve, or the equivalent. Schools are generally divided into elementary schools (kindergarten to grade 8) and high schools (grades 9 to 12). 

However, in many areas, middle schools are also provided and in some schools, particularly in rural areas, the elementary and middle levels can be combined into one school. In 2003, Grade 13, also known as the Ontario Academic Credit or &quot;OAC&quot; year, was eliminated in Ontario; it had previously been required only for students who intended to go on to university. Children are required to attend school until the age of sixteen in most provinces, while students in Ontario and New Brunswick must attend schools until the age of 18.

Some Canadian provinces offer segregated-by-religious-choice, but nonetheless Crown-funded and Crown-regulated, religiously based education. In Ontario, for example, Roman Catholic schools are known as &quot;Catholic Schools&quot; or &quot;Separate Schools&quot;, not &quot;Public Schools&quot;, although these are, by definition, no less &quot;public&quot; than their secular counterparts.

====Latin America====

In some countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, the term public schools ( in Spanish, in Portuguese) is used for educational institutions owned by the federal, state, or city governments which do not charge tuition. Such schools exist in all levels of education, from the very beginning through post-secondary studies. Mexico has nine years of free and compulsory primary and secondary education.

Panama has 11 years of compulsory education, from pre-kindergarten to 9th grade, with children first entering at four or five years old and parents are required by law to give financial support to their children until they are 25 years old if they are studying.

Education in Argentina is a responsibility shared by the national government, the provinces and federal district and private institutions, though basic guidelines have historically been set by the Ministry of Education. Closely associated in Argentina with President Domingo Sarmiento&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the sovereign should be educated.&quot; The word &quot;sovereign&quot; refers to the people. Education has been extended nearly universally and its maintenance remains central to political and cultural debate. Even though education at all levels, including universities, has always been free, there are a large number of private schools and universities.

==== United States ====

In the United States, the noun phrase &quot;public school&quot; is generally used for elementary, middle, or high schools (secondary schools) funded or run by a governmental entity, most commonly as local district of a U.S. state. &quot;Private school&quot; generally refers to primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions that are not government-owned. Elementary, middle, and high schools that are operated by a religious organization are commonly called parochial schools, though, in practice, the term is generally used to refer only to schools operated by the Catholic Church or mainline denominations; the term &quot;Christian school&quot; is generally used to refer to schools operated by Evangelical, Pentecostal, Charismatic, or fundamentalist Christian churches. (The term &quot;state school&quot; is colloquial for state university, a tertiary college or university in a state university system. It may also used by state governments in the names of juvenile prisons.)

The role of the U.S. federal government in education is limited and indirect. Direct control of education is a power reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly or implicitly give the federal government authority to regulate education. However, any public or private school that accepts educational funding from the federal government, including participation in collegiate federal financial aid programs such as Pell Grants and Stafford Loans by accepting the funds or participating in a particular federal program, is subject to federal jurisdiction as a result of that participation.

The U.S. Department of Education, based in Washington, D.C., supervises the role of the federal government in education. Direct regulation of public, private, and parochial schools is done by state and territorial governments; schools in Washington, D.C., are regulated by the Government of the District of Columbia. Regulation of public schools is typically accomplished through a state education agency and a state department of education. There is usually a state superintendent of schools, who is appointed or elected to co-ordinate the state department of education, the state board of education, and the state legislature. Statewide education policies are disseminated to school districts or their equivalents. They are associated with counties, or with groups of counties, but their boundaries are not necessarily coterminous with county boundaries. The intermediate school districts encompass many local school districts. Local school districts operate with their own local boards, which oversee operations of the individual schools within their jurisdiction.

In most states, the county or regional intermediate school districts merely implement state education policy and provide the channels through which a local district communicates with a state board of education, state superintendent, and department of education. They do not establish county or regional policies of their own.

Local school districts are administered by local school boards, which operate public elementary and high schools within their boundaries. Public schools are often funded by local taxpayers, and most school boards are elected. However, some states have adopted new funding models that are not dependent upon the local economy.

Public schools are provided mainly by local governments. Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards by jurisdiction over school districts. The school districts are special-purpose districts authorised by provisions of state law. Generally, state governments set minimum standards relating to almost all activities of elementary and high schools, as well as funding and authorisation to enact local school taxes to support the schools, primarily through real property taxes. The federal government funds aid to states and school districts that meet minimum federal standards. School accreditation decisions are made by voluntary regional associations. The first free public school in America was the Syms-Eaton Academy (1634) in Hampton, Virginia, and the first tax-supported public school in America was in Dedham, Massachusetts, founded by Rev. Ralph Wheelock. In the United States, 88% of students attend public schools, compared with 9% who attend parochial schools, 1% who attend private independent schools, and 2% who are homeschooled.

Public school is normally split up into three stages: elementary school (kindergarten to 5th or 6th grade), middle (&quot;intermediate&quot; or junior high school) from 5th, 6th, or 7th grade to 8th or 9th grade, and high school (9th or 10th to 12th grade). The middle school format is increasingly common in which the elementary school contains kindergarten or 1st grade to 5th or 6th grade and the middle School contains 6th or 7th and 8th grade. In addition, some elementary schools are splitting into two levels, sometimes in separate buildings: elementary school (usually K–2) and intermediate (3–5). Some middle schools are different.

The K–8 format is also an emerging popular concept in which students may attend only two schools for all of their K–12 education. Many charter schools feature the K-8 format in which all elementary grades are housed in one section of the school, and the traditional junior high school students are housed in another section of the school. Some very small school districts, primarily in rural areas, still maintain a K–12 system in which all students are housed in a single school. A few 7–12 schools also exist.

In the United States, institutions of higher education that are operated and subsidised by the states are also referred to as &quot;public&quot;. However, unlike public high schools, public universities usually charge tuition, but fees are usually much lower than those charged by private universities, particularly for students who meet in-state residency criteria. Community colleges, state colleges, and state universities are examples of public institutions of higher education. In particular, many state universities are regarded as among the best institutions of higher education in the US but usually are surpassed in ranking by certain private universities and colleges, such as those of the Ivy League, which are often very expensive and extremely selective in the students they accept. In several states, the administrations of public universities are elected via the general electoral ballot.

=== Asia ===
==== Bangladesh ====

Public or Government-funded schools are found throughout Bangladesh. They are referred to as &#x27;Government High School&#x27;. These schools mostly teach students from Year 1 to 10, with examination for students in year 10. All public schools follow the National Board Curriculum. Many children, especially girls, drop out of school after completing the 5th Year in remote areas. In larger cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong, however, this is fairly uncommon. Many good public schools conduct an entrance exam, although most public schools in the villages and small towns usually do not. Public schools are often the only option for parents and children in rural areas, but there are large numbers of private schools in Dhaka and Chittagong. Many Bangladeshi private schools teach their students in English and follow curricula from overseas, but in public schools lessons are taught in Bengali.

==== China ====

In China, state schools are funded and administered by the education sector within the government. Although some, especially high schools, have started to charge a fair portion of parents of students an additional tuition fee, due to the increased places offered by the schools in recent years. Top state schools are often very selective, however. Students who miss their entrance requirement may still gain places if they meet a relatively lower requirement and their parents are willing to pay for the additional fees. Some parents appreciate the idea as they may send their children to good schools even though they may not be academically qualified, while others believe that it is not fair for someone who has a background of poverty.

The public spending on schools in China has been uneven due to insufficient investment in education. This condition is in favor of urban schools and it is promoted by past policies such as the mandate for rural public schools to have a higher student-to-teacher ratio. The inequality of resources is exacerbated by the way public schools in urban areas enjoy more support since local governments have more developed economies. Aside from the disparity between urban and rural public schools, there was also the dichotomized system adopted since 1978, which divided schools into two groups: key schools () and non-key schools (). 

Key schools receive more funding due to the goal of developing first-class education in a limited number of schools in a short period of time. The key school system was canceled by the 2006 amendment to the Compulsory Education Law, along with the introduction of reforms that address education inequality.

==== Hong Kong ====

In Hong Kong the term &quot;government schools&quot; is used for free schools funded by the government. There are also subsidised schools, which are the majority in Hong Kong and many of which are run by religious organisations, Direct Subsidy Scheme schools, private schools and international schools in Hong Kong. Some schools are international schools, which are not subsidised by the government.

==== India ====

During British rule, a number of state higher education establishments were set up (such as universities in Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai), but little was done by the British in terms of primary and secondary schooling. Other indigenous forms of education are being revived in various ways across India. According to current estimates, 80% of all Indian schools are government schools making the government the major provider of education. However, because of the poor quality of public education, 27% of Indian children are privately educated.
According to some research, private schools often provide superior educational results at a fraction of the unit cost of government schools. The teacher to student ratio is usually much lower in private schools than in the government ones, creating more competitive students.
Education in India is provided by the public sector as well as the private sector, with control and funding coming from three levels: federal, state, and local. The Nalanda University was the oldest university-system of education in the world. Western education became ingrained into Indian society with the establishment of the British Raj.

====Indonesia====

Education in Indonesia is overseen by two government ministries: the Ministry of Education and Culture for all education matters up to the tertiary education, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs for Islamic school matters up to the tertiary education. Education may be obtained from state schools, private schools, or through homeschooling. There is a 12-year compulsory education program from the government. The Indonesian educational system is divided into three stages:

* primary education ()
* secondary education ()
* tertiary education ()

====Japan====

Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but private education is popular at the upper secondary and university levels.

==== South Korea ====

The first public education system on record was put in place during the Koryo Dynasty. The national school system was put in place under Hak-Je () enacted by King Seong Jong, which was modelled after the public education systems of the Song and Tang Dynasties in China. Hak-Je involved operating national universities, called Gukjagam in the capital and called HyangAk in other regions. In King SeongJong Year 6, 987 A.D., a pair of a medical doctor and a scholarly doctor were appointed to administer academic systems and curriculums at Hyang-Ak: scholarly education included subjects of geography, history, math, law, and others. In King SeongJong Year 11, 992 A.D., the first known national public schools called Ju-Hak () were opened in each Ju and Gun, states and counties, to improve nationwide academic performances.

After the ceasefire agreement for the civil war was declared, north and south states of Korea established their own education system. In South Korea, education in public schools (1–12) is compulsory with the exception of kindergarten. All aspects of public education are the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, which executes administration of schools, allocation of funding, certification of teachers and schools, and curriculum development with standardised textbooks across the country. In 2000, South Korea spent 4.2% of its GDP in education. As of the 2007 United Nations Education Index, South Korea was ranked eighth in the world.

==== Malaysia ====
Education in Malaysia is overseen by two government ministries: the Ministry of Education for matters up to the secondary level, and the Ministry of Higher Education for tertiary education. Although education is the responsibility of the federal government, each state has an Education Department (which is in turn a local branch of the federal education ministry) to help co-ordinate educational matters in their respective states. The main legislation governing education is the Education Act of 1996. Education may be obtained from government-sponsored schools, private schools, or through homeschooling. By law, primary education is compulsory. As in other Asian countries such as Singapore and China, standardised tests are a common feature.

==== Philippines ====

Philippines has had a public education system since 1863 and is the oldest in Asia. It was created during the Spanish colonization of the islands and mandated the establishment of a school for boys and a school for girls in every municipality. The modern public schools in the Philippines are run by the Department of Education. Some public schools collect miscellaneous school fees to fund school extra-curricular activities or to improve school equipment and services.

==== Sri Lanka ====

Most of the schools in Sri Lanka are maintained by the government as a part of the free education. With the establishment of the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments. However the old schools which had been around since the colonial times were retained by the central government, thus creating three types of government schools: National Schools, Provincial Schools, and Piriven.

National Schools come under the direct control of the Ministry of Education therefore have direct funding from the ministry. Provincial Schools consists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka which are funded and controlled by the local governments. Piriven are monastic college (similar to a seminary) for the education of Buddhist priests. These have been the centres of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today these are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education.

=== Europe ===
==== Denmark ====

The Danish school system is supported today by tax-based governmental and municipal funding from day care through primary and secondary education to higher education and there are no tuition fees for regular students in public schools and universities. The Danish public primary schools, covering the entire period of compulsory education, are called &quot;folkeskoler&quot; (literally &#x27;people&#x27;s schools&#x27; or &#x27;public schools&#x27;). The consists of a pre-school class (mandatory since 2009), the 9-year obligatory course and a voluntary 11th year. It thus caters for pupils aged 6 to 17. It is also possible for parents to send their children to various kinds of private schools. These schools also receive government funding, although they are not public. In addition to this funding, these schools may charge a fee from the parents.

==== England ====

England has a strong state-funded school system. There are a number of categories of English state-funded schools including academy schools, community schools, faith schools, foundation schools, free schools, grammar schools, maths schools, studio schools, university technical colleges, state boarding schools and City Technology Colleges. 

About one third of English state-funded schools are faith schools; i.e. affiliated with religious groups, most often from the Church of England (approximately 2/3 of faith schools), or the Roman Catholic Church (around 3/10). There are also schools affiliated to other Christian churches; in 2011, there were 42 Jewish, 12 Muslim, 3 Sikh and 1 Hindu faith schools. These faith schools include sub-categories such as faith-academy schools, voluntary aided schools, and voluntary controlled schools: most voluntary controlled schools are faith schools.

All of these are funded through national and local taxation. All state-funded schools in England are required to follow the National Curriculum, which is made up of twelve subjects. Every state school must offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, and prepares pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.

For each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at the relevant Key Stages. Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil. They should plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard. Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. 

A high number of state-funded secondary schools are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects in which the school specialises, such as Cirencester Deer Park School which currently has 5 specialisms. State schools may request payment from parents for extracurricular activities such as swimming lessons and field trips, provided these charges are voluntary.

Comprehensive schools typically describe secondary schools for pupils aged approximately 11–18, that do not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to a selective school system where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria, usually academic performance. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced as state schools on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of English secondary school pupils attend a comprehensive state school. Comprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning. 
Technical education in state schools are introduced during the secondary school years and goes on into further education (FE) and higher education (HE). Further education incorporates vocational oriented education as well as a combination of general secondary education. Students can also go on to a further education college or sixth form college to prepare themselves for a wide range of apprenticeships and study. Major provider of vocational qualifications include the Business and Technology Education Council, City and Guilds of London Institute and Edexcel. Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas typically require 1 and 2 years of full-time study and credit from either HNE or Diplomas can be transferred toward an undergraduate degree. Along with the HNC and HND, students who are interested in other vocational qualifications may pursue a foundation degree, which is a qualification that trains students to be highly skilled technicians. The National Apprenticeship Service also offers vocational education where people at ages of 16 and older enter apprenticeships in order to learn a skilled trade. There are over 60 different certifications can be obtained through an apprenticeship, which typically lasts from to 3 years. Trades apprentices receive paid wages during training and spend one day at school and the rest in the workplace to hone their skills. 

Grammar schools may be run by the local authority, a foundation body or an academy trust. They select their pupils based on academic ability. The original purpose of medieval grammar schools was the teaching of Latin. Over time the curriculum was broadened, first to include Ancient Greek, and later English and other European languages, natural sciences, mathematics, history, geography, art and other subjects. In some localities children can enter a grammar school if they pass the eleven plus exam; there are also a number of isolated fully selective grammar schools and a few dozen partially selective schools. The oldest state school in England is Beverley Grammar School, which was founded in 700 AD.

==== France ====

The French educational system is highly centralised, organised, and ramified. It is divided into three stages:

* primary education ()
* secondary education ()
* tertiary or college education ()

Schooling in France is mandatory as of age three. Primary education takes place in kindergarten () for children from 3 to 6 and () from 6 to 11. For public schools, both schools building and administrative staff are managed by the borough&#x27;s () while professors are () civil servants. Some children even start earlier at age two in or class, which is essentially a daycare facility.

French secondary education is divided into two schools:

* the for the first four years directly following primary school
* the for the next three years

The completion of secondary studies leads to the . The &quot;baccalauréat&quot; (also known as ) is the end-of- diploma students sit for in order to enter university, a &quot;Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles&quot;, or professional life. The term refers to the diploma and the examinations themselves. It is comparable to British A-Levels, American SATs, the Irish Leaving Certificate and German Abitur.

Most students sit for the which is divided into three streams of study, called . The (S) is concerned with mathematics and natural sciences, the (ES) with economics and social sciences, and the (L) focuses on French and foreign languages and philosophy.

The &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; of France are higher education establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public universities. They are generally focused on a single subject area, such as engineering, have a moderate size, and are often quite (sometimes extremely) selective in their admission of students. They are widely regarded as prestigious, and traditionally have produced most of France&#x27;s scientists and executives.

==== Germany ====

Education in Germany is provided to a large extent by the government, with control coming from state level, &quot;(Länder)&quot; and funding coming from two levels: federal and state. Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through the respective state&#x27;s ministry of education. Decisions about the acknowledgment of private schools (the German equivalent to accreditation in the US) are also made by these ministries. However, public schools are automatically recognised, since these schools are supervised directly by the ministry of education bureaucracy.

Although the first kindergarten in the world was opened in 1840 by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel in the German town of Bad Blankenburg, and the term kindergarten is even a loanword from the German language, they are not part of the German school system. Article 7 Paragraph 6 of the German constitution (the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;) abolished pre-school as part of the German school system. However, virtually all German kindergartens are public. They are either directly run by municipal governments, or contracted out, most often, to the two largest Christian churches in Germany. These municipal kindergartens are financed by taxes and progressive income-based customer fees, but are not considered part of the public school system.

A German public school does not charge tuition fees. The first stage of the German public school system is the (primary school – 1st to 4th grade or, in Berlin and Brandenburg, 1st to 6th grade) After (at 10 or 12 years of age), there are four secondary schooling options:
* &quot;Hauptschule&quot; (the least academic, much like a modernised &quot;Volksschule&quot;) until 9th or, in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia, until 10th grade. The students attending those types of school may be awarded the &quot;Hauptschulabschluss&quot; (school-leaving certificate) or in some cases also the &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;
* &quot;Realschule&quot; (formerly ) until 10th grade, usually awards the &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;
* &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (high school) until 12th grade or 13th grade, with Abitur as exit exam, qualifying for admission to university.
* &quot;Gesamtschule&quot; (comprehensive school) with all the options of the three &quot;tracks&quot; above.

A largely corresponds to an American high school. However, it offers the same school leaving certificates as the other three types of German secondary schools: the school leaving certificate of a after 9th grade or in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia after 10th grade, the , also called Mittlere Reife (school-leaving certificate of a after 10th grade, and , also called , after 13th or seldom after 12th grade. Students who graduate from or continue their schooling at a vocational school until they have full job qualifications.

This type of German school, the , is generally an upper-secondary public vocational school, controlled by the German federal government. It is part of Germany&#x27;s dual education system. Students who graduate from a vocational school and students who graduate with good GPA from a can continue their schooling at another type of German public secondary school, the , a vocational high school. The school leaving exam of this type of school, the , enables the graduate to start studying at a (polytechnic), and in Hesse also at a university within the state. The from a or enables the graduate to start studying at a polytechnic or at a university in all states of Germany.

A number of schools for mature students exists. Schools such as the Abendrealschule serve students that are headed for the Mittlere Reife. Schools such as the Aufbaugymnasium or the Abendgymnasium prepare students for college and finish with the Abitur. These schools are usually free of charge. In Germany, most institutions of higher education are subsidised by German states and are therefore also referred to as (public universities) In most German states, admission to public universities is still cheap, about two hundred Euro per semester. In 2005, many states introduced additional fees of 500 Euro per semester to achieve a better teaching-quality. Additional fees for guest or graduate students are charged by many universities.

==== Ireland ====

In the Republic of Ireland, post-primary education comprises secondary, community and comprehensive schools, as well as community colleges (formerly vocational schools). Most secondary schools are publicly funded, and regulated by the state, but privately owned and managed. Community colleges are state-established and administered by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), while community and comprehensive schools are managed by Boards of Management of differing compositions.

Privately owned and managed secondary schools receive a direct grant from the state, and are subdivided into fee-paying and non fee-paying schools. The vast majority of these schools are operated by religious organisations, primarily the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland. The charging of fees is a decision of the individual school. The Irish constitution requires the state to &quot;endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral formation.&quot; In practice, most people are educated by Catholic institutions as there are few alternatives in much of the country. Non fee-paying secondary schools are usually considered to be public or state schools, while private school and fee-paying schools are considered synonymous. This is colloquial and not technically accurate.

All schools which are provided for by the state, including privately run and fee-paying secondary schools, teach the national curriculum. All students are expected to take the standardised Junior Certificate examination after three years. An optional non-academic Transition Year is provided by most but not all secondary schools immediately following the Junior Certificate. Students subsequently take one of three leaving-certificate programmes: the traditional Leaving Certificate, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) or the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA). The vast majority of secondary school students take the traditional Leaving Certificate. Both the traditional Leaving Certificate and the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme can lead to third-level education, with LCVP more focused on practical skills.

==== Italy ====

In Italy, a state school system or education system has existed since 1859, two years before Italian unification).
Italy has a long history of universities: founded in 1088, the University of Bologna is the oldest university in the world and 5 out of 10 of the oldest universities are currently based in Italy.

The Italian school system is divided into three grades:

* Primary education (non-compulsory nursery school and elementary school)
* Secondary education (first grade (11–14) and second grade (14–19))
* Higher education (university (19+))

In Italy, there are three different types of schools and upper education:
* – public/state-owned school: completely free of charge for the entire compulsory school (until the age of 16). After that, for the last two years of high school, students have to pay a tax of €15.13/year. Public university is free of charge for lower income students and increases based on income. Each university chooses the maximum amount of tuition based on the student&#x27;s income. 
* – privately owned school that has signed an agreement with the MIUR and that are included in the (Italian) National Education System. The government provides a specific grant for each student. Students usually have to pay a high fee for each year at the school. schools are considered part of the educational system and students of those schools receive the same type of diploma and can access the same support (local school government) as the state-owned schools.
* – privately owned school not included in the National Education System. They do not receive government funds and students have to pass the final exams in a public or school in order to get a diploma.

Differently from other countries, in the Italian educational system, public schools statistically give students a better preparation compared to and private schools.

====The Netherlands====

Public, special (religious), and general-special (neutral) schools are government-financed, receiving equal financial support from the government if certain criteria are met. Although they are officially free of charge, these schools may ask for a parental contribution. Private schools rely on their own funds, but they are highly uncommon in the Netherlands.

==== Romania ====

All schools up to high school are publicly funded in Romania and regulated by the Ministry of National Education. Higher education like universities may be state sponsored under certain conditions (family income and school performance). Although there are private schools in Romania, they are not a popular choice since the quality of education is on par with the public schools.

==== Russia ====

Education in Russia is provided predominantly by the state and is regulated by the Ministry of Education and Science. Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws. Russia&#x27;s expenditure on education has grown from 2.7% of the GDP in 2005 to 3.8% in 2013, but remains below the OECD average of 5.2%.

====Scotland====

In Scotland, a public school is &quot;a state-controlled school run by the local burgh or county education authority, generally non-fee-paying and supported by contributions from local and national taxation&quot;.

The Church of Scotland was established in 1560, during the Protestant Reformation period, as the official state religion in Scotland. In the following year, it set out to provide a school in every parish controlled by the local kirk-session, with education to be provided free to the poor, and the expectation that church pressure would ensure that all children took part. In the year of 1633 the Parliament of Scotland introduced local taxation to fund this provision. Schooling was not free, but the tax support kept fees low, and the church and charity funded poorer students. This had considerable success, but by the late 18th century the physical extent of some parishes and population growth in others led to an increasing role for &quot;adventure schools&quot; funded from fees and for schools funded by religious charities, initially Protestant and later Roman Catholic.

From the early 18th century, reference was made to &quot;the publick school of the paroch&quot;. State-administered universal education was introduced earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom, and the designation was incorporated into the name of many of these older publicly run institutions. In 1872, education for all children aged 5 to 13 was made compulsory with &quot;public schools&quot; (in the Scots meaning of schools for the general public) under local school boards. 

An 1872 Act of Parliament declared that schools &quot;under the management of the school board of a parish&quot;, and those &quot;under the management of the school board of a burgh&quot;, were public schools within the meaning of the Act.
The leaving age was raised to 14 in 1883, and the Leaving Certificate Examination was introduced in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education. School fees were ended in 1890. The Scottish Education Department ran the system centrally, with local authorities running the schools with considerable autonomy. In 1999, following devolution from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to the new Scottish Parliament, central organisation of education was taken over by departments of the Scottish Executive, with running the schools coming under unitary authority districts.

Children in Scottish state schools (or public schools) typically start primary school, or attend a junior school, aged between four and a half and five and a half depending on when the child&#x27;s birthday falls. Children born between March and August would start school at the age of five years and those born between September and February start school at age four-and-a-half. Pupils remain at primary school for seven years completing Primary One to Seven.

Then aged eleven or twelve, pupils start secondary school for a compulsory period of four years, with a final two years thereafter being optional. Pupils take National 4 &amp; 5 examinations at the age of fifteen/sixteen, sometimes earlier, most often for up to eight subjects. These include compulsory exams in English, mathematics, a foreign language, a science subject and a social subject. It is now a requirement of the Scottish Government that all pupils have two hours of physical education a week. Each school may arrange these compulsory requirements in different combinations. The minimum school leaving age is generally sixteen, after completion of Standard Grade examinations. Pupils who continue their school education after the age of sixteen, may choose to study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The Curriculum for Excellence was introduced to secondary schools in session 2012/2013. The assessment of pupils&#x27; attainment will change, with &#x27;National&#x27; qualifications replacing most Standard Grade and Intermediate Grade qualifications.

==== Spain ====

Primary Education (EP) and Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO) make up Spain&#x27;s Basic Education. These two stages of education are compulsory and free of charge for everyone. Generally they comprise ten years of schooling, normally between the ages of 5 and 16. Once the compulsory stages have been passed, it is possible to opt for the Bachillerato (similar to the Baccalaureate or A-levels), aimed at gaining access to university-level education. Alternatively, it is possible to opt for Professional Training or Higher-level Training Cycles (FP).

Education in Spain is currently regulated by the Ley Orgánica de Educación (LOE) of 2006, as amended by the Ley Orgánica por la que se modifica la LOE de 2006 (LOMLOE) of 2020. Education is a universal right and a duty in Spain. Therefore, it is compulsory, free and guaranteed for 100% of the population up to the age of 16. From that stage, there are a number of options available, some of them partially government-funded.

====Sweden ====

In Sweden, state schools are funded by tax money. This goes for both primary schools (Swedish: ), and secondary school (Swedish: ) and universities. When studying at a university, however, students might have to pay for accommodation and literature. There are private schools as well which also receive funding from the government, but may not charge tuition fees.

Compulsory education starts at six years of age, starting in (pre-school). The Swedish primary school is split into three parts; – &#x27;the low stage&#x27;, which covers grades 1 to 3. Students learn the basics of the three core subjects, called in Swedish: Swedish, English and mathematics. It also includes some natural science. , &#x27;the middle stage&#x27;, which covers grades 4 to 6, introduces the children to more detailed subjects. Woodwork and needlework, social and domestic science, and even a second, foreign language in grade 6, a (B-language). The languages available are usually French, Spanish or German depending on the school. , &#x27;the high stage&#x27;, is the last stage of compulsory education, between grades 7 and 9. This is when studies get more in-depth and are taken to an international level.

Swedish children take national exams at grades 3, 6 and 9. Children at grade 3 take these exams in two of the three main subjects: Swedish and mathematics. In grade 6 the exams extend to the third main subject, English, and in grade 9 the exams also extend to one of the subjects in natural sciences, and one of the four subjects in (geography, history, religious studies, and civics). They first receive grades in grade 6. The grading system is letter-based, ranging from A–F, where F is the lowest grade and A is the highest. F means &quot;not approved&quot;, while all other ratings above F mean &quot;approved&quot;. There are only objectives for E, C and A; D means the person has met most but not all objectives for C, while B means the person has met most objectives for A. When applying to (senior high schools) or universities, a (&#x27;meritous point value&#x27;) is calculated. E is worth 10 points, D 12.5 points, C 15 points, and so on. Children that are not approved in Swedish, English or mathematics will have to study at a special high school program called the introductory program. Once they are approved, they may apply to an ordinary high school program. Swedes study at high school for three years, between the ages of 16 and 18.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====

Government schools in Australia, also known as public or state schools, are free to attend for Australian citizens and permanent residents, whereas private schools charge attendance fees. They can be divided into two categories: open and selective schools. The open schools accept all students from their government-defined catchment areas, whereas selective schools admit students based on some specific criteria, e.g. academic merit. As of 2022, Australia has one of the most privatised education systems in the world with more than 30 per cent of primary students and over 40 per cent of secondary students attending private schools, while the OECD average is around 18 per cent

Regardless of whether a school is part of the government or private systems, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks of their state or territory. The curriculum framework however provides for some flexibility in the syllabus, so that subjects such as religious education can be taught. Most school students wear uniforms. The name for a government-funded primary school varies by state and territory. In New South Wales, the name &quot;public school&quot; is used. In Queensland, the name &quot;state school&quot; is used. In every other state and territory, the name &quot;primary school&quot; is used.

==== New Zealand ====

Both state and state-integrated schools are government-funded. The latter are former private schools which are now &quot;integrated&quot; into the state system under the &quot;Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&quot; &quot;on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them&quot;. According to an OECD report, about 86% of all school-aged children attend state schools and 10% attend state integrated schools.

The government provides education as a right—it is freely available up to the end of the calendar year following a student&#x27;s 19th birthday. Primary and secondary education is compulsory for students between the ages of 6 and 16, although in practice most children enrol at school on their 5th birthday. Most students start at age 5 and remain in school for the full 13 years. While there is overlap in some schools, primary education ends at Year 8 and secondary education at Year 13. In some areas Years 7 and 8 are considered part of intermediate school—a separate school which acts as a bridge between primary and secondary education—leaving primary school to end at Year 6.

<text>New Democracy (French: &quot;Nouvelle démocratie&quot;) was a political party in Canada founded by William Duncan Herridge in 1939. Herridge, a former Conservative party adviser, had been Canada&#x27;s Envoy to the United States from 1931–1935 during the government of R. B. Bennett; who was Herridge&#x27;s brother-in-law.

Herridge advocated monetary reform and government intervention in the economy as a means of fighting the Great Depression. His ideas were similar to those of the social credit movement, and in the 1940 election, the Social Credit Party of Canada joined with Herridge to run candidates jointly under the New Democracy umbrella.

The experiment was unsuccessful as Herridge failed to win a seat, and the three New Democracy 
Members of Parliament elected were Social Credit supporters. The name New Democracy remained associated with the national Social Credit movement until 1944, when the name Social Credit was readopted at a national convention held in Toronto.

<text>The Turbo Touch 360 is a series of aftermarket third-party controllers made by Triax for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, and Sega Genesis (the latter version also being compatible with Atari and Commodore systems). The Turbo Touch 360 was first shown off at the International Consumer Electronics Show in late 1993, but the controller never replaced the D-Pad in later consoles because it was reported to be overly sensitive and uncomfortable to use.

==Design and functionality==

Whereas most controllers used a D-pad with mechanical switches, the Turbo Touch had an octagonal plate with eight capacitive touch sensors arranged in the cardinal directions; contrary to the &quot;360&quot; name, the controller only provided digital input along the cardinal directions. The idea was that the controller could be operated with less physical force, reducing thumb injuries and &quot;numb thumb&quot;, thereby improving player comfort and health. The controller was endorsed by Dr. Robert Grossman, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports injuries.
Other than the touchpad, the controllers have a standard set of features typical for controllers of the time, with turbo support.

==Reception==
The controller was ranked the ninth worst video game controller by &quot;IGN&quot; editor Craig Harris.

<doc id="471607" wikidata="Q180372" url="?curid=471607" title="Sirocco">
<text>Sirocco ( ) or scirocco is a Mediterranean wind that comes from the Sahara and can reach hurricane speeds in North Africa and Southern Europe, especially during the summer season.

==Names==
&quot;Sirocco&quot; derives from &quot;&quot; (), verbal noun of &quot;&quot;, related to the East, &quot;aš-šarq&quot;. Various names for this wind in other languages include: 
* 
* or &quot;marin&quot;
* 
* or 
* , or : sirókos
* or 
* (), in Croatia rarely &quot;širok&quot; (широк)
* or 
* Libyan Arabic: , , which means &quot;coming from the Qibla&quot;
* , which means &quot;fifty&quot; (&quot;fifty-day wind&quot;)
* , probably from with the same meaning as ; or 
* , pronounced širguī

The Roman poet Horace refers to the sirocco at Trevico in Apulia as &quot;Atabulus&quot; (a Messapic word) in his account of his journey to Brundisium in 37 BC.

==Development==
Siroccos arise from warm, dry, tropical air masses that are pulled northward by low-pressure cells moving eastward across the Mediterranean Sea, with the wind originating in the Arabian or Sahara deserts. The hotter, drier continental air mixes with the cooler, wetter air of the maritime cyclone, and the counter-clockwise circulation of the low propels the mixed air across the southern coasts of Europe.

==Effects==

The sirocco causes dusty dry conditions along the northern coast of Africa, storms in the Mediterranean Sea, and warm wet weather in Southern Europe. The sirocco does not affect other parts of Europe. The sirocco&#x27;s duration may be as short as half a day or may last several days. While passing over the Mediterranean Sea, the sirocco picks up moisture; this results in rainfall in the southern part of Italy, known locally as &quot;blood rain&quot; due to the red sand mixed with the falling rain.

Sirocco is commonly perceived as causing unease and an irritable mood in people. In addition, many people attribute health problems to the wind, either because of the heat and dust brought from African coastal regions, or because of the cool dampness further north in Europe. The dust in the sirocco winds can cause abrasion in mechanical devices and penetrate buildings.

Sirocco winds with speeds of up to are most common during autumn and spring. They reach a peak in March and in November when it is very hot.

When combined with a rising tide, the sirocco can cause the &quot;acqua alta&quot; phenomenon in the Venetian Lagoon.

This wind also has an impact on fishing. For example, the anchovies caught in the Gulf of Trieste, near Barcola, which are in great demand as a delicacy, are caught only in a sirocco. In cold winds, like the bora, the fish disappear into the Adriatic.

<text>Eichhornia, commonly called water hyacinths, was a polyphyletic genus of the aquatic flowering plants family Pontederiaceae. Since it was consistently recovered in three independent lineages, it has been sunk into &quot;Pontederia&quot;, together with &quot;Monochoria&quot;. Each of the three lineages is currently recognized as subgenera in Pontederia:
* Pontederia subg. Cabanisia, which includes &quot;P. meyeri&quot;, &quot;P. paniculata&quot; (the Brazilian water hyacinth), and &quot;P. paradoxa&quot;
* Pontederia subg. Oshunae, which includes the common water hyacinth, &quot;P. crassipes&quot;
* Pontederia subg. Eichhornia, which includes &quot;P. azurea&quot;, &quot;P. diversifolia&quot;, &quot;P. heterosperma&quot;, and &quot;P. natans&quot;

Pontederia subg. Eichhornia is pantropical, centered in South America but with &quot;P. natans&quot; being endemic to continental Africa and Madagascar. The other three species are restricted to the Neotropics.

It was named in honour of , an early-19th-century Prussian minister of education.

==Description==
Its species are perennial aquatic plants (or hydrophytes) with prostrate and densely branched stems. The inflorescences can have one to 30 conspicuously attractive flowers, mostly lavender to pink in colour, rarely white.

<doc id="471623" wikidata="Q127868" url="?curid=471623" title="M. G. Ramachandran">
<text>Maruthur Gopalan Ramachandran (17 January 1917 – 24 December 1987), popularly known by his initials M.G.R., was an Indian actor, politician, and philanthropist who served as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu from 1977 until his death in 1987. He was the founder and first general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. On 19 March 1988, M.G.R. was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour. M.G.R. is regarded as one of the most influential politicians of post-independence India. Apart from politics, as a film personality, he won the National Film Award, three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, and three Filmfare Awards South.

In his youth, M.G.R. and his elder brother M. G. Chakrapani became members of a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, M.G.R. joined the Indian National Congress. After a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film &quot;Sathi Leelavathi&quot; in a supporting role. By the late 1940s, he had graduated to lead roles. M.G.R. was one of the &quot;three biggest names of Tamil cinema&quot;, the other two being Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan. While Sivaji Ganesan excelled in dramatic films, Gemini Ganesan was known for his romantic films, and M.G.R. was popular as an action hero.

M.G.R. became a member of the C. N. Annadurai-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and rose through its ranks, using his popularity as a film star to build a political base. In 1972, three years after Annadurai&#x27;s death, he left the DMK, then led by M. Karunanidhi, to form his own new party—the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Five years later, M.G.R. steered an AIADMK-led alliance to victory in the 1977 election, routing the DMK in the process. He became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the first film actor to become a chief minister in India. Except for a four-month interregnum in 1980, when his government was overthrown by the Indira Gandhi-led government of India, he remained as chief minister until his death in 1987, leading the AIADMK to two more electoral wins in the 1980 and 1984 elections.

In October 1984, M.G.R. was diagnosed with kidney failure as a result of diabetes. He died on 24 December 1987 in his M.G.R. Thottam residence in Ramapuram after a prolonged illness. His autobiography, &quot;&quot;Naan Yaen Piranthen?&quot; (&quot;Why Was I Born?&quot;)&quot;, was published in 2003.

==Early life and background==
M.G.R. was born in Nawalapitiya, Kandy District, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in a Malayali family to Melakkath Gopalan Menon and Maruthur Satyabhama from Palakkad, in the modern-day Indian state of Kerala. His parents were Nairs from Palakkad district. M.G.R. further claimed to be of Tamil Kongu Vellalar descent, whose ancestors had settled in Kerala centuries ago and become Nairs.

Gopalan Menon died when M.G.R. was just two and a half years old. Just after the death of his father, his sister too died due to ill health. His mother had to struggle alone to bring up M.G.R. and his brother. She took the decision to return to India and went back to Kerala, where she failed to get the support of her relatives. With the support of Velu Nair of Kumbakonam, Satyabhama put both her sons in school.

It was in school that M.G.R. started his acting career and joined the Boys Company drama troupe, taking part in the rigorous training programs conducted by the troupe in the areas of singing, dancing, sword fighting, diction, and memory with active interest and involvement.

The challenges faced by him during his early life and childhood played an important role in shaping his character and political career. After a brief acting stint overseas with the help of Madras Kandasamy Mudaliar, during which he had played female roles, he returned to India, rejoined the Boys Company, and started playing lead roles for the first time.

In his early days, M.G.R. was a devout Hindu and a devotee of Lord Murugan and his mother&#x27;s favourite god, Lord Guruvayurappan. After joining the DMK, he turned into a rationalist.

M.G.R.&#x27;s first marriage was to Chitarikulam Bargavi, also known as Thangamani, who died early due to an illness. He later married for the second time, to Satyanandavati, who also died soon after marriage due to tuberculosis. Later, M.G.R. married for the third time, this time to V. N. Janaki Ramachandran, a former Tamil film actress who was once his leading lady, and later she became chief minister of Tamil Nadu after his death. M.G.R. had no biological children from any of his marriages.

==Acting career==

Ramachandran made his film debut in 1936, in the film &quot;Sathi Leelavathi&quot;, directed by Ellis R. Dungan, an American-born film director. Generally starring in romance or action films, Ramachandran got his breakthrough in the 1950 film written by M. Karunanidhi. Soon he rose to popularity with the 1954 film &quot;Malaikkallan&quot;. He acted as hero in the Tamil film industry&#x27;s first ever full length Gevacolor film, the 1955 &quot;Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum&quot;. He won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the film &quot;Rickshawkaran&quot; in 1972.

His 1973 blockbuster &quot;Ulagam Sutrum Valiban&quot; broke the previous box office records of his films. It was one of the few films filmed abroad in those days. It was shot in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Japan. His acting career ended in 1987 with his last film &quot;Ullagam Suthi Paru&quot;, in which he acted even though he had been diagnosed with kidney failure. Ramachandran said there was no question of ‘retirement’ for anyone associated in whichever capacity with the cine field.

=== Mentor ===
 Kali N. Rathnam, a pioneer of Tamil stage drama, and K.P. Kesavan were mentors of Ramachandran in his acting career.

== Political career ==
Ramachandran was a member of the Congress Party till 1953, and he used to wear khādī. In 1953  Ramachandran joined the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation, attracted by founder C. N. Annadurai. He became a vocal Tamil and Dravidian nationalist and prominent member of DMK. He added glamour to the Dravidian movement which was sweeping Tamil Nadu. Ramachandran became a member of the state Legislative Council in 1962. At the age of 50, he was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1967. After the death of his mentor, Annadurai, Ramachandran became the treasurer of DMK in 1969 after Muthuvel Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister.

=== 1967 assassination attempt ===
The actor and politician M. R. Radha and Ramachandran had worked in 25 films together. On 12 January 1967, Radha and a producer visited Ramachandran to talk about a future film project. During the conversation, M. R. Radha stood up and shot Ramachandran in his left ear twice and then tried to shoot himself.

After the operation, Ramachandran&#x27;s voice changed. Since he had been shot in his ear, Ramachandran lost hearing in his left ear and had ringing problems in the ear. These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see Ramachandran at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid Ramachandran an advance for Ramachandran&#x27;s next film. After getting released from the hospital and finishing &quot;Arasakattalai&quot;, Ramachandran acted in Devar&#x27;s film &quot;Vivasaayee&quot; against doctors&#x27; advice. Due to the operation, Ramachandran&#x27;s speaking parts in the film &quot;Kaavalkaaran&quot; were reduced. This was the only film in which Ramachandran spoke with old and new voices between scenes: Ramachandran was acting in the film &quot;Kaavalkaran&quot; in 1967 opposite J. Jayalalithaa when the shooting occurred.

&quot;Petralthaan Pillaya&quot; was the last film of Ramachandran-M. R. Radha together. Shooting ended just few days before Ramachandran was shot. The bullet was permanently lodged in his neck and his voice damaged. Within hours of the shooting, some 50,000 fans had gathered at the hospital where Ramachandran had been taken. People cried in the streets. For six weeks, he lay in the hospital as fans awaited each report of his health. He was visited by a steady stream of commoners and luminaries of film industry, polity and bureaucracy. From his hospital bed, he conducted his campaign for the Madras Legislative Assembly. He won twice the number of votes polled by his Congress rival and the largest vote polled by any candidate for the Assembly.

=== Differences with Karunanidhi and birth of AIADMK ===

In 1972, DMK leader Karunanidhi started to project his first son M. K. Muthu in a big way in film and politics, around the same time Ramachandran was accusing that corruption had grown in the party after the demise of C. N. Annadurai. Consequently, Ramachandran was expelled from the party. Upon his ouster from DMK, his volunteer Anakaputhur Ramalingam started a new party called the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Joined as a member of that party and became its leader and general secretary. later renamed All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the only powerful opponent of the DMK. He mobilised between 1972 and 1977 to spread and preach his party ambition with films like &quot;Netru Indru Naalai&quot; (1974), &quot;Idhayakani&quot; (1975), &quot;Indru Pol Endrum Vazhga&quot; (1977), etc.

=== Continued success in TN Assembly elections ===
==== 1977 Assembly elections ====

The AIADMK contested the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative. The election was a four cornered contest between the AIADMK, DMK, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Janata Party. The AIADMK allied itself with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM), while INC(I) and Communist Party (CPI) contested as allies. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)and Janata Party (JNP) contested the elections alone. The AIADMK did not field any candidate in the Usilampatti Constituency in support of the All India Forward Bloc leader P.K. Mookiah Thevar. Similarly, the AIADMK also supported the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate M. Abdul Latheef in the Vaniyambadi Constituency. In the parliamentary elections that occurred just three months prior to these elections, there had been two major alliances – the AIADMK led AIADMK-INC-CPI coalition and the DMK led DMK-NCO-JNP-CPM coalition. But in the months that followed the parliamentary election, these coalitions fell apart. The AIADMK alliance won the elections by winning 144 seats out of 234 and Ramachandran became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Upon winning the 1977 state elections, Ramachandran became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on 30 June 1977, remaining in office till his death in 1987. In 1979, members of his party Satyavani Muthu and Aravinda Bala Pajanor became the first non-Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu to be ministers in the Union Cabinet. The AIADMK won every state assembly election as long as Ramachandran was alive. Although Annadurai and Karunanidhi had acted in stage plays in trivial roles, in their younger days, before becoming chief minister, Ramachandran was the first popular film actor to be a Chief Minister in India.

==== 1980 Parliament and assembly elections ====
All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam allied with Indian National Congress (Indira) in the 1977 parliamentary election. However, when Janata Party won the election and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister, Ramachandran extended unconditional support to the Janata party Government. He continued his support to the Charan Singh Government in 1979. After the fall of the Charan Singh government, fresh parliamentary elections were conducted in 1980. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam struck alliance with INC(I). AIADMK and Janata Party alliance won only 2 seats in Tamil Nadu in that parliamentary election. INC(I) won the election and Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.
Congress-DMK victory in the 1980 parliamentary election emboldened their alliance and made them think that people lost their faith in Ramachandran government. DMK pressed the central government to dismiss the Tamil Nadu government using similar allegations used by Ramachandran to dismiss DMK government in 1976. The AIADMK ministry and the assembly were dismissed by the central government and fresh elections conducted in 1980.
Despite their victory at the 1980 Lok Sabha polls, DMK and Indira Congress failed to win the legislative assembly election. AIADMK won the election and its leader and incumbent Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran was sworn in as Chief Minister for the second time.

==== 1984 assembly elections ====

Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984. During the same time, M. G. Ramachandran was diagnosed with kidney failure and admitted into a hospital in New York City. Rajiv Gandhi assumed office immediately and this required a fresh mandate from the people. Indian National Congress (Indira) and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed an alliance and contested the election. M. G. Ramachandran was confined to the hospital. Video coverage of Ramachandran recuperating in hospital along with Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination were stitched together by the AIADMK man in charge of campaigning, R. M. Veerappan. The video was distributed and played across all over Tamil Nadu. Rajiv Gandhi visited cyclone-hit areas in Tamil Nadu, which also boosted the alliance. The sympathy wave created by Indira&#x27;s assassination, Ramachandran&#x27;s illness and Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s charisma helped the alliance sweep the election.DMK leader M. Karunanidhi did not contest this election, due to the fact that the AIADMK leader Ramachandran was admitted to a hospital in the U.S. and Indira Gandhi being assassinated. It was a landslide victory for AIADMK-Congress combine which won 195 seats in assembly polls. The electoral victory proved the undying charisma of Ramachandran upon the masses.
==== Failed Merger Talks with DMK ====
Karunanidhi claimed on 1 April 2009 and again on 13 May 2012 that Ramachandran was ready for the merger of his party with the DMK in September 1979, with former chief minister of Odisha Biju Patnaik acting as the mediator. The plan failed, because Panruti Ramachandran, who was close to Ramachandran acted as a spoiler and Ramachandran changed his mind.

=== Criticism and controversies ===

Even after his death, Ramachandran proved to be very popular in the state and his rule has been cited by many of his contemporaries as best in the country. However, his rule is not without criticism. Economic data under his rule showed that annual growth and per capita income was lower than the national average and the state went from being second among 25 industrialised states in development after Kamaraj&#x27;s rule to tenth. This decline, according to critics has been due to shift of government resources from power and irrigation to social and agriculture sector according to Madras Institute of Development Studies reported in 1988. In addition, the emphasis on &quot;welfare schemes&quot; such as free electricity to farmers, mid-day meal schemes, etc. has been seen by many as taking money away from infrastructure development that could have benefited the poor. In addition, the liquor tax imposed during his rule was considered to contribute to a regressive tax mostly affecting the poor.

Other criticisms have been on Ramachandran&#x27;s centralised decision-making, which many blame for inefficiency and corruption taking hold of his administration. Some examples stated by the critics include Goondas act in 1982 and other acts that limited political criticism in the media, which led to a &quot;police state&quot; during his administration. While these criticisms have been in the minority, supporters of Ramachandran counter that most of these problems were a result of the party members serving Ramachandran rather than the leader himself. While he is not considered a divisive figure in the state, critics and supporters alike agree that his charisma and popularity trumped policy decisions that led to his eventual success during his tenure as chief minister.
Natwar Singh in his autobiography One Life is Not Enough alleges that Ramachandran covertly supported the cause of independent Tamil Eelam and financed the LTTE and their cadres were being given military training in Tamil Nadu. He also alleges that Ramachandran considered Jaffna an extension of Tamil Nadu and without informing the Indian Government at the time, had gifted 4 crore rupees to the LTTE.

Ramachandran has been accused of being intolerant towards the media. In April 1987, the Editor of Ananda Vikatan S. Balasubramanian was sentenced to 3 months in jail by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for publishing a cartoon, depicting government ministers as bandits and lawmakers as pickpockets, though specific legislature was not specified. But due to media outcry, he was released and Balasubramanian later won a case against his arrest. Earlier, Vaniga Otrumai editor A.M. Paulraj was sentenced to 2 weeks imprisonment by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for his writing.

==== Bharat Ratna ====

After his death in 1987, he became the third Chief Minister from the state of Tamil Nadu to receive the Bharat Ratna after C. Rajagopalachari and K. Kamaraj. The timing of the award was controversial, due to the fact that it was given so quickly after his death and he was elected as Chief Minister only 11 years before the award. Many opponents, mostly outside Tamil Nadu, criticised then ruling party INC, under Rajiv Gandhi to have influenced the selection committee to give the award to help win the upcoming 1989 Lok Sabha election. The ruling party forming a coalition with J. Jayalalithaa, the successor to Ramachandran at that time, were able to sweep Tamil Nadu, winning 38 out of 39 seats, INC were however unable to win nationally.

==== Commemorative coins ====
To commemorate Ramachandran&#x27;s Birth centenary in 2017, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India decided to issue ₹100 and ₹5 coins that would bear his image as a portrait along with an inscription of &quot;Dr. M. G. Ramachandran Birth Centenary&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
He personally offered relief in disasters and calamities like fire, flood, drought, and cyclones. He was the first donor during the war with China in 1962 (Sino-Indian War), donating Rs. 75,000 to the war fund. He was the founder and editor of &quot;Thai&quot; weekly magazine and &quot;Anna&quot; daily newspaper in Tamil. He was the owner of Sathya Studios and Emgeeyar Pictures (willed to charity) which produced many of the films he acted in. He had gifted a golden sword weighing half a Kilogram to Mookambika temple in Kollur, Udupi district.

== Illness and death ==
In October 1984, Ramachandran was diagnosed with kidney failure as a result of uncontrolled diabetes, which was soon followed by a mild heart attack and a massive stroke. He was rushed to the Downstate Medical Center in New York City, United States for treatment, undergoing a kidney transplant. Despite his poor health, he did contest the assembly election held later that year while still confined to the hospital, winning from Andipatti. During the election, photos of Ramachandran recuperating in hospital were published, creating a sympathy wave among the people. Ramachandran returned to Madras on 4 February 1985 following his recovery. He was sworn in as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the third consecutive term on 10 February 1985. The next two years and 10 months were spent in frequent trips to the United States for treatment.

Ramachandran never fully recovered from his multiple health problems and died on 24 December 1987 at 3:30 am in his Ramavaram Gardens residence in Manapakkam after his prolonged illness. He was 70 years old. His death sparked a frenzy of looting and rioting over the state. Shops, cinemas, buses and other public and private property became the target of violence. The police resorted to issuing shoot-at-sight orders. Schools and colleges immediately announced holidays until the situation came under control. Violence during the funeral alone left 129 people dead and 47 police personnel badly wounded. Young and married women allegedly shaved their heads bald and dressed like widows. Men whipped themselves until they bled to death. There were some extreme instances of people burning themselves to death and burning villages.

His body was kept in state at Rajaji Hall for two days for the public to pay their respect. On 25 December 1987, his remains were buried at the northern end of Marina Beach, now called MGR Memorial, adjacent to the Anna Memorial.

This state of affairs continued for almost a month across Tamil Nadu. Around one million people followed his remains, around 30 followers committed suicide and people had their heads tonsured. After his death, his political party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, was split between his wife V. N. Janaki Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa; they merged in 1989.

In 1989 Dr. M. G. R. Home and Higher Secondary School for the Speech and Hearing Impaired was established at the erstwhile residence M.G.R. Thottam, Ramapuram, in accordance with his last will and testament written in January 1987. His official residence at 27, Arcot Street, T. Nagar is now M.G.R. Memorial House and is open for public viewing. His film studio, Sathya Studios, has been converted into a women&#x27;s college in the name of Dr. MGR-Janaki College of Arts and Science for Women.

<text>Lionel Charles Robbins, Baron Robbins, (22 November 1898 – 15 May 1984) was a British economist, and prominent member of the economics department at the London School of Economics (LSE). He is known for his leadership at LSE, his proposed definition of economics, and for his instrumental efforts in shifting Anglo-Saxon economics from its Marshallian direction. He is famous for the quote, &quot;Humans want what they can&#x27;t have.&quot;

==Early life==
Robbins was born in Sipson, west of London, the son of Rowland Richard Robbins (1872–1960), known as Dick, and his wife Rosa Marion Harris; his father was a farmer, a member of Middlesex County Council involved also in the National Farmers&#x27; Union, and the family was Strict Baptist. His sister Caroline became a noted Professor of History at Bryn Mawr College.

Robbins was educated at home, at Hounslow College (a preparatory school) and at Southall County School. He went to University College London in October 1915, beginning an Arts degree and attending lectures by W. P. Ker, the medievalist Francis Charles Montague, and A. F. Pollard. Wishing to serve in World War I, he began training in early 1916 at Topsham, Devon. He was in the Royal Field Artillery as an officer from August 1916 to 1918, when he was wounded by a sniper on 12 April in the Battle of the Lys and returned home with the rank of lieutenant.

During the war Robbins became interested in guild socialism, reading in G. D. H. Cole and by personal contact with Reginald Lawson, a connection from the Harris side of the family. Through Clive Gardiner, an artist commissioned by Dick Robbins in 1917 to paint his son&#x27;s portrait, Robbins met first Alfred George Gardiner, Clive&#x27;s father, and then his ally the activist James Joseph Mallon. After his convalescence and 1919 demobilisation from the army, Robbins was employed for about a year by the Labour Campaign for the Nationalization of the Drink Trade, a position found with Mallon&#x27;s help. The campaign was an offshoot of the State Management Scheme set up during the war, and Robbins worked in Mecklenburgh Square, London for Mallon and Arthur Greenwood.

In 1920, Robbins resumed studies at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he was taught by Harold Laski, Edwin Cannan and Hugh Dalton. He graduated B.Sc. (Econ) in 1923 with first class honours. Dalton&#x27;s biographer Ben Pimlott wrote that Robbins was the &quot;most promising student of his generation at the L.S.E.&quot;

==Academic==
After graduation, Robbins found a six-month position as a researcher for William Beveridge, via Dalton. He had applied successfully to New College, Oxford for a fellowship in economics, with references from Alfred George Gardiner (shortly to be his father-in-law), Theodore Gregory and Graham Wallas. It was a one-year lecturing position, and he returned to LSE in 1925, again with Dalton&#x27;s backing, as assistant lecturer, shortly becoming lecturer.

In 1927, Robbins returned to New College as a Fellow, but continued to teach at LSE, lecturing on a weekly basis. After the death in 1929 of Allyn Abbott Young, Professor of Economics at LSE, Robbins replaced him in the chair, and moved with his wife to Hampstead Garden Suburb. During the 1930s he built up the economics department, hiring Friedrich von Hayek, John Hicks and Nicholas Kaldor.
==Contra Keynes==
Robbins clashed with John Maynard Keynes in early October 1930, on the Committee of Economists of the Second MacDonald ministry. It was a small working group chaired by Keynes, apart from the Economic Advisory Council, to consider economic policy in the Great Depression conditions, comprising also Hubert Henderson and Josiah Stamp from the council, with Arthur Cecil Pigou and Robbins representing academia.

Robbins refused to sign a draft by Keynes of proposals including tariffs and wanted the chance to submit a minority report. Keynes as chair would not grant the request, given that Robbins was in a minority of one. Robbins, who had compared the protectionist views to those of Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaverbrook, walked out of a meeting, and briefed Philip Snowden against the report that contained a version of his criticism, considered himself poorly treated. Bad feeling persisted for years between LSE and Cambridge economists.

Initially, Robbins was opposed to Keynes&#x27;s 1936 &quot;General Theory&quot;. His own 1934 treatise on the Great Depression is an analysis belonging to that period of his thought. Later, he accepted the need for government intervention.

==World War II period==
Robbins joined the British government&#x27;s Central Economic Information Service in summer 1940, from Cambridge to where the LSE had moved. The Service was split into the Central Statistical Office and the Economic Section, which Robbins headed as Director from September 1941. The points system devised in 1941 for rationing of clothing, footwear and household goods, by Robbins with Peggy Joseph and James Meade, is considered a successful policy.

From 1942 Robbins worked largely on planning for post-war reconstruction, with Meade. When John Boyd Orr and Frank Lidgett McDougall successfully lobbied to put food security on the agenda of the United Nations, Robbins attended the resulting 1943 conference at Hot Springs, Virginia. He represented the United Kingdom also at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 and took part in the negotiation of the 1946 Anglo-American loan. Over this period, he became fully reconciled with John Maynard Keynes.

Post-war, Robbins wrote:

I grew up in a tradition in which, while recognition was indeed given to the problems created by the ups and downs of the trade cycle and the fluctuations of aggregate demand, there was a tendency to ignore certain deep-seated possibilities of disharmony, in a way which, I now think, led sometimes to superficiality and sometimes to positive error. I owe much to Cambridge economists, particularly to Lord Keynes and Professor Robertson, for having awakened me from dogmatic slumbers in this very important respect.

==Later life==
The Robbins Report of 1963 advocated substantial expansion of higher education in the United Kingdom, taking the line, often called now the &quot;Robbins principle&quot;, that demand from those suitably qualified should drive its development. There was background at the LSE for the view taken, in work of Richard Layard and Claus Moser, and it drew also on recent ideas of Jean Floud and A. H. Halsey. Robbins became the first Chancellor of the new University of Stirling in 1968. He also advocated major government support for the arts, as well as universities.

In later life, Robbins turned to the history of economic thought, publishing studies on English doctrinal history. His LSE lectures, as he gave them in 1980, were later published.

==Views==
Robbins is noted as a free market economist, and for his definition of economics.

===Influences===
As an undergraduate, Robbins felt he had gained much from Philip Wicksteed&#x27;s &quot;The Common Sense of Political Economy&quot; (1910). Within the earlier British tradition, he admired William Stanley Jevons&#x27;s mastery of statistical evidence, and for theory which he thought had abiding relevance. Skidelsky takes Robbins to be a possible but in any case rare example of a British continuator of John Neville Keynes and his &quot;Scope and Method of Political Economy&quot; (1891). He corresponded with the American Frank Knight from 1931 until Knight&#x27;s death in 1972.

===&quot;An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science&quot; (1932)===

The definition appears in the &quot;Essay&quot; by Robbins as:

:Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

After contention in the 1930s, this definition reached some general acceptance among economists. The book has six chapters, and the second half remains controversial.

The &quot;Essay&quot; was influenced by Nathan Isaacs, a close friend from the army, and a paper he had given to the Aristotelian Society in June 1931. The same month, Robbins sent Isaacs a copy of his inaugural lecture, commenting (in relation to business cycles) that its content was out of date through not taking account of work of the Austrians Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. Hayek&#x27;s cycle theory, and Jacob Viner&#x27;s work on the balance of payments for Canada, both developments of the 1920s, were used as contrasting examples, respectively of new theorisation and the checking of existing theories. Part of the intellectual framework was the insistence of Isaacs on the importance of inductive reasoning, where Robbins relied more naturally on deductions.

===Collectivism===
Robbins came to dislike collectivism. His early interest in Samuel George Hobson and G. D. H. Cole as proponents of guild socialism led him to join the National Guilds League, but did not last beyond 1920, though he continued longer with socialist views. He became involved in the socialist calculation debate, taking the side of the Austrian School.

==Honours and awards==
Robbins was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1944 Birthday Honours. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1955. On 16 June 1959 he was created a life peer as Baron Robbins, of Clare Market in the City of Westminster. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. In the 1968 New Year Honours he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH).

Robbins received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1967. The Lionel Robbins Building at the London School of Economics is named after him. Since 2009 that building has had on the exterior of it an installation artwork, &quot;Blue Rain&quot;, by the American artist Michael Brown. There is also a Lionel Robbins Building at Nottingham Trent University.

==Works==
The early paper &quot;The Representative Firm&quot; (1928) has been considered Robbins&#x27;s most celebrated article. In its origins a talk to the London Economic Club, it attacked a major concept of Alfred Marshall. Ralph George Hawtrey of the Club defended Marshall&#x27;s ideas in a letter to Robbins, who within weeks submitted a version to Keynes as editor of the &quot;Economic Journal&quot;.

Robbins&#x27; 1966 Chichele lecture on the accumulation of capital (published in 1968) and later work on Smithian economics, &quot;The Theory of Economic Policy in English Classical Political Economy,&quot; have been described as imprecise.

<text>Abdul Ahad Momand (; born 1959) is an Afghan-German and former Afghan Air Force aviator who became the first, and currently only, Afghan astronaut to journey to outer space. He became one of Soyuz TM-6 crew members and spent nine days aboard the Mir space station in 1988 as an Interkosmos research cosmonaut. 

Momand holds many records as an Afghan astronaut. He became the first person to take the Quran to space and recite it there. When he spoke to his mother on the phone from space, Pashto became the fourth language to be officially spoken in space. He became the first Afghan citizen and the fourth Muslim to visit outer space, after Sultan bin Salman Al Saud, Muhammed Faris, and Musa Manarov.

== Early years ==

Momand was born sometime in 1959 in Sardeh Band, Andar District, within the Ghazni Province of Afghanistan. He belongs to the Momand tribe of the Pashtun ethnic group. After completing his education in Habibia High School, he entered the Kabul Polytechnic University in 1976 at the age of 17, and graduated two years later before being drafted into the military in 1978.

== Career ==

Momand was then sent to the Soviet Union for pilot training. There, he studied at the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots and the Kiev Higher Air Force Engineering School before returning to Afghanistan in 1981, where he rose through the ranks, becoming a chief navigator at Bagram Air Base. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1984 to train at the Gagarin Air Force Academy. Not long after graduating in 1987, he was selected as a cosmonaut candidate for the Interkosmos project. The other cosmonaut candidate sent for training was Mohammad Dawran, an Afghan MiG-21 pilot with the rank of Colonel. While Dawran had more political connections than Momand and held a higher military rank (since Momand was a captain at the time), Dawran&#x27;s appendicitis was the deciding factor in Momand being chosen for the primary crew. Dawran then became part of the backup crew for Momand&#x27;s mission.

Along with Commander Vladimir Lyakhov and Flight Engineer Valery Polyakov, Momand was part of the Soyuz TM-6 three-man crew, which launched at 04:23 GMT 29 August 1988. Momand&#x27;s inclusion in the mission was a significant symbol during the Soviet–Afghan War.

During his nine days stay on the Mir space station in 1988, Momand took photographs of his country, participated in astrophysical, medical and biological experiments. He also spoke to then-President Mohammad Najibullah of Afghanistan, and brewed Afghan tea for the crew. Momand was also recorded reciting the Quran in space at the request of the Afghan Government while his legs were held by another crew member outside of the shot to prevent him from floating away.

Lyakhov and Momand returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-5. The 6 September planned landing of Soyuz TM-5 was delayed because of mechanical complications on the Mir. Radio Moscow reassured listeners that Lyakhov and Momand were fine and in touch with Mission Control. However, their sanitation facilities were on board the jettisoned orbital module and consequently they soiled themselves during the delay. A recording, colloquially called the der’mo tape, was played of them laughing about this. A day later, the retro-fire was successful, and at 00:50 GMT Soyuz TM-5 landed near Dzhezkazgan. During touchdown, there was no live radio coverage, but only live television pictures of Mission Control. 

As Momand returned to Afghanistan, he was greeted by a large crowd that threw flowers at him, as the Mujahideen fired a barrage of rockets towards the city of Kabul. The city was the site of 25 separate rocket attacks in a single day, resulting in 35 dead and 165 injured. 

Momand was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 7 September 1988 as well as the Hero of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Order of Lenin.

During his flight to space, his mother was extremely distraught over the safety of her son. President Najibullah called Momand&#x27;s mother into the President&#x27;s office and arranged an audio/video conference between Momand and her. By this event, Pashto became the fourth language spoken in space. On his return, he was made deputy minister of civil aviation.

Momand was in India sorting out a complaint regarding Ariana Airlines during the collapse of Najibullah&#x27;s government in 1992. Momand decided to emigrate to Germany, and applied for asylum there, becoming a German citizen via naturalisation in 2003. He worked in the printing service and is now an accountant residing in Ostfildern near Stuttgart. He received the Russian Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; in 2010. He returned to Afghanistan in 2013, at the request of then-President Hamid Karzai, for the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his space mission as shown in the BBC Persian documentary “Kabul to the Galaxy” (Persian: کابل تا کهکشان, &quot;Kābul tā Kahkešān&quot;).

== Personal life ==

Momand is married to Zulfara and has 2 daughters and a son. Momand is fluent in 4 languages, Pashto, Persian, Russian and German.

<doc id="471649" wikidata="Q1592332" url="?curid=471649" title="Head shop">
<text>A head shop is a retail outlet specializing in paraphernalia used for consumption of cannabis and tobacco and items related to cannabis culture and related countercultures. They emerged from the hippie counterculture in the late 1960s, and at that time, many of them had close ties to the anti-Vietnam War movement as well as groups in the marijuana legalization movement like LeMar, Amorphia, and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

Products sold may include magazines (e.g., about cannabis culture, cannabis cultivation, tattooing, and music), clothing, and home décor (e.g., posters and wall hangings illustrating drug culture themes such as cannabis, jam bands like The Grateful Dead, Phish, psychedelic art, etc.). Some head shops also sell oddities, such as antique walking sticks and sex toys. Since the 1980s, some head shops have sold clothing related to the heavy metal or punk subculture, such as band T-shirts and cloth patches with band logos, studded wristbands, bullet belts, and leather boots. Other items offered typically include hashish pipes, &quot;one hitter&quot; pipes; pipe screens; bongs (also referred to as water pipes); roach clips (used for smoking the end of a marijuana &quot;joint&quot;); vaporizers used for inhaling THC vapor from cannabis; rolling papers; rolling machines; small weighing scales; small ziplock baggies; cannabis grinders (i.e. herb grinders); blacklight-responsive posters and blacklights; incense; cigarette lighters; &quot;stashes&quot;, which include a range of standard consumer products such as clocks, books, tins of cleaning powder, and toilet brushes which have hidden compartments for cannabis and non-camouflaged &quot;stash boxes&quot; which are tins or wooden containers for storing marijuana; and legal highs such as whipped-cream chargers (which contain nitrous oxide) and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; (both of which are illegal in some countries and some US states for recreational purposes). Some head shops also sell items used for home cultivation of marijuana plants, such as hydroponic equipment and lights and guidebooks on cultivation. Since the 2000s, some head shops also sell e-cigarettes and the flavoured liquids used with these devices.

==History==
American head shops originated in the 1960s in cities with high concentrations of college-age youth, often growing out of independently owned poster or candle stores. Historically, U.S. head shops proliferated on St. Mark&#x27;s Place in New York City&#x27;s East Village, in West Los Angeles, in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, and in Chicago&#x27;s Old Town. Sources cite the Psychedelic Shop on Haight Street in San Francisco as the first head shop in the United States. Operated by United States Army veteran Ron Thelin and his younger brother Jay, it opened on January 3, 1966. Four months later Jeff Glick opened &quot;Head Shop&quot; on East Ninth Street in New York City. Also in 1966, The Birmingham Balloon Company opened at 113 Fry Street in Denton, Texas.

From 1968 to c. 1975, head shops served as an important outlet for underground newspapers and the underground comix of Robert Crumb and other counterculture cartoonists, which had little access to the established channels of newsstand distribution. 

The shops&#x27; popularity eventually waned with the aging of that era&#x27;s baby boomer generation, as well as a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Miller v. California, that found that local communities could decide their own First Amendment standards concerning obscenity. In the mid-1970s, the sale of drug paraphernalia was outlawed in many places, and the distribution network for underground comics and newspapers dried up. In addition, the retail mainstream discovered and co-opted aspects of the head shop&#x27;s market niche, such as acid rock and eco-friendly products.

==Legality==

===Ireland===

Head shops exist and are legal in Ireland, and were reported by authorities to be opening at a rate of one per week in January 2010. The legality of the shops was discussed in the Seanad Éireann, and a motion was passed requesting the Government to regulate the sale of products. Some politicians were in favour of outlawing the shops whereas others argued that prohibiting the purchases of legal intoxicants would be a &quot;huge mistake&quot; which would allow illegal street dealers to thrive.

During early 2010, a number of incidents of firebombing and arson against head shops took place around the country. Some attacks were traced to disgruntled drug dealers. One petrol bomb attack occurred in the home county of the then Minister for Justice, Dermot Ahern, and hours later, plans for legislation for regulation of head shops got underway.

Many head shop products became illegal in Ireland on 23 August 2010 when the new &quot;Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010&quot; became law. The Act empowered Gardaí (Irish police) to seek court orders to close head shops suspected of selling drug-like products, with the onus on the owners to prove they are not doing so.

===United States===
In the United States, head shops are legal so long as they only sell items used for legal substances. Shops typically place signs stating that the products sold are &quot;for tobacco use only&quot; or &quot;not for use with illegal substances&quot;. In many head shops, a sign will be posted (and often reiterated verbally) stating that customer references regarding the use of the shop&#x27;s products for illegal drug use will result in the suspension of all sales for that time period, and/or removal of the customer from the shop. In some shops, simply saying the word &quot;bong&quot; is grounds for removal from the shop.

Head shops have been targeted by the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2003, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted fifty-five people on charges of selling drug paraphernalia in Idaho, Texas, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio as part of &quot;Operation Headhunter&quot; and &quot;Operation Pipe Dreams&quot;, including comedian Tommy Chong. During the investigation, government officials also targeted customers of the shops, arresting those who were in possession of drugs like cannabis and heroin. Chong was caught by sending shipments through the mail. Today, online head shops have also become prevalent; there are hundreds of head shops willing to sell their products online.

The legality of cannabis varies widely in the United States, but in states where medical cannabis is legal, cannabis dispensaries often double as head shops.

Notably, in the state of Florida, items &quot;designed for use in ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing cannabis, cocaine, hashish, hashish oil, or nitrous oxide into the human body&quot; are illegal. At the same time, &quot;pipes primarily made of briar, meerschaum, clay, or corn cob&quot; are legal.

==Smart shops==

Smart shops are shops (prominently found in the Netherlands, where the sale of marijuana is effectively legal) that sell psychoactive substances and various smokable herbs in addition to the drug paraphernalia found in head shops.

<doc id="471657" wikidata="Q2934668" url="?curid=471657" title="Camberwell, Victoria">
<text>Camberwell ( ) is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Camberwell recorded a population of 21,965 at the 2021 census.

The western, southern and eastern boundaries of the suburb generally follow Burke Road, Toorak Road and Warrigal Road respectively. The northern boundary generally follows Riversdale Road, except for an area in the northwest where it extends upwards to Canterbury Road, incorporating Camberwell, East Camberwell and Riversdale railway stations. Known for grand, historic residences and tranquil, leafy streets, Camberwell is commonly regarded as one of Melbourne&#x27;s most prestigious and exclusive suburbs. Camberwell has been Melbourne&#x27;s geographical centre of population since the 2020s.

==History==
===Etymology===
Camberwell received its name as a result of an early settler being reminded of the way three roads intersected in the south London district of Camberwell. This intersection is now known as Camberwell Junction. The development that followed was a product of the expansion of Melbourne&#x27;s suburban rail network in the 1880s.

===Pre-European settlement===
The area now known as Camberwell was inhabited from an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years ago and is part of the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.

===19th century===
Camberwell Post Office opened on 12 October 1864.

The Prospect Hill Road Precinct area is adjacent to the railway station and is the oldest part of the suburb. The original subdivision was relatively generous blocks, which were quickly filled with fine Victorian and Edwardian houses. Due to its hilly topography, many east–west streets in the Prospect Hill area have a view of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. Its main commercial centre developed along Burke Road from its railway station to Camberwell Junction, 500 m to the south. Several tram routes converge on this point.

Though the area was originally agricultural, Camberwell is now one of the most well-established of Melbourne&#x27;s affluent suburbs. It is part of the City of Boroondara, the local government area with the lowest socio-economic disadvantage index in Australia. There is almost no industrial land in Camberwell, and commercial uses are concentrated near the Burke Road precinct, which has long been one of the busiest in suburban Melbourne.

===20th century===
====Podgor redevelopment====
In the 1980s, a planned major development to the east of the Burke Road shopping strip met substantial opposition from local residents. National Mutual Life Association proposed a 24,000 sq.m. three-storey enclosed shopping centre, which drew substantial objection. Developer Floyd Podgornik&#x27;s Podgor Group (Podgor) purchased the site from National Mutual in 1987 and submitted revised plans to Camberwell Council. When the Council approved Podgor&#x27;s plans in 1988, 400 residents stormed the meeting. At elections later that year, anti-development protesters won control of the Council and although the developer subsequently proposed a lesser development, in 1990 it rescinded its decision to approve the shopping centre. Subsequently, Podgor sued the council to court and was awarded $25m in damages.

===21st century===
====Camberwell Station redevelopment====
Opposition similar to that facing the Podgor redevelopment was mounted regarding plans dating from 1999 to develop Camberwell railway station to incorporate retail and office development. High-profile present and past residents Geoffrey Rush and Barry Humphries supported the protest action, but the development was finally approved in 2009. However, the development never eventuated after VicTrack, the owner of the land, announced that it would not proceed with construction.

==Geography==
===Urban structure===
Camberwell Junction is designated as one of 26 Principal Activity Centres in the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy.

===Demographics===
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 21,965 people in Camberwell.
* 65.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 7.0%, England 3.3%, India 2.0%, New Zealand 2.0% and Malaysia 1.7%.
* 71.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 9.3%, Greek 2.4%, Cantonese 2.1%, Italian 1.5% and French 1.3%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 43.8%, Catholic 20.5% and Anglican 8.9%.

===Localities===
East Camberwell, Hartwell, Riversdale and Willison are four officially named neighbourhoods, within the general area of the railway stations of the same name.

===Landmarks===
The historic Rivoli Cinemas sit just west of Camberwell Junction, in the adjacent suburb of Hawthorn East.

A feature of Camberwell is the Burke Road shopping strip, which stretches north, approximately 600 m from Camberwell Junction, where three tram routes converge.

The southern areas of the Prospect Hill Precinct (from the south side of Prospect Hill Road to Riversdale Road) were developed for the Riversdale Estate, Kasouka Estate and Gladstone Park Estates from the late nineteenth century. The Kasouka Estate was created in 1891 and included Kasouka Road, Trafalgar, Prospect Hill and Riversdale Roads. Kasouka Road has a high level of visual cohesion and is dominated by Victorian and Edwardian period villas.

The Camberwell Sunday Market has been operated by the Rotary Club of Balwyn since 1976 and comprises 370 stallholders, selling secondhand clothing, books, furniture, and crafts.

===Parks and gardens===
Camberwell has several parks, reserves and playgrounds, most notably, Frog Hollow Reserve, Fordham Gardens, Cooper Reserve, Bowen Gardens, Lynden Park, Highfield Park, Riversdale Park and Willison Park.

==Economy==

Camberwell and Canterbury were once suburbs which made up the local government area City of Camberwell, which was dissolved in 1994 and amalgamated with two other LGAs to form a new LGA, the City of Boroondara.

==Places of worship==

Ten churches were established in the area; Camberwell South Anglican Church, St Dunstan&#x27;s Anglican, St John&#x27;s Anglican, St Mark&#x27;s Anglican, Our Lady of Victories Basilica, St Dominic&#x27;s Catholic Church Salvation Army, Methodist (now Uniting), Presbyterian, Greek Orthodox, Church of Christ and Baptist.
