<text>Nicholas Hart Smith (born November 5, 1934) is a retired American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan, who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 until 2005, representing from the 7th District of Michigan.

==Life and career==
Smith was born in Addison, Michigan, where he still lives. He earned a B.A. from Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, in 1957 and an M.S. in Economics from the University of Delaware in 1959. Smith served in the United States Air Force from 1959 to 1961 where he became a captain. He was Squadron Commander in the Civil Air Patrol and later an Intelligence Officer. He operates a dairy farm in Addison.

Smith served on the Somerset Township board of trustees, 1962 to 1968. He was township supervisor and on the Hillsdale County board of supervisors from 1966 to 1968. He then served as assistant deputy administrator and director of energy in the United States Department of Agriculture between 1972 and 1974.

Smith served as a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from the 41st District from 1979 to 1983. He then served as a member of Michigan Senate from the 19th District from 1983 to 1993. While in the Michigan Senate, he was appointed President Pro Tempore from 1983 to 1990.
Smith ran for Congress in the 7th District in 1992, winning the Republican primary by seven points. His nearest opponent was fellow state senator Joe Schwarz, a considerably more moderate Republican. Smith was the major candidate from the eastern portion of the district, while Schwarz and the others were all from the western portion. The candidates from the western portion split the vote, allowing Smith to win despite getting only 37 percent of the vote. No Democrat even filed for the general election, handing the seat to Smith. He was reelected five times.

Smith was a relatively low-profile congressman for most of his career, compiling a reliably conservative voting record despite representing a fairly marginal district. However, Smith gained national attention in 2004 in the controversy over the Medicare Modernization Act. Smith had announced earlier he was not running for reelection later that year, having promised during his initial run to only serve six terms (12 years) in the House. However, he&#x27;d endorsed his son, Brad, as his successor. Smith stated that members of the House Republican leadership told him that if he voted for the Medicare bill, business interests would give $100,000 to his son&#x27;s campaign. When Nick Smith refused to vote for the bill, he was told that his son would never get into Congress. Ultimately, Brad Smith was defeated in the Republican primary by Schwarz, who was elected in November.

In March 2004, the House Ethics Committee admonished fellow Representative from Michigan Candice Miller and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay for their involvement in the affair.

==Early life==
Clarkson was born on December 29, 1959, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of Jackie Clarkson (née Brechtel), a New Orleans politician and councilwoman, and Arthur &quot;Buzz&quot; Clarkson, a school administrator who worked at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine. She is one of five sisters, all of whom attended O. Perry Walker High School, where she graduated in 1977. She was raised in Algiers, a suburb of New Orleans on the West Bank of the Mississippi River.

From 1977 to 1979, Clarkson studied speech pathology at Louisiana State University before deciding she wanted to pursue a drama degree. In 1980, she transferred to Fordham University in New York City to enroll in their undergraduate acting program, from which she graduated summa cum laude in 1982. She then earned her Master of Fine Arts at the Yale School of Drama in 1985.

==Career==
===Early work===
After graduating from the Yale School of Drama, Clarkson was cast in a 1986 Broadway production of &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; as a replacement in the role of Corrinna Stroller. The following year, she made her feature film debut in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987), portraying Catherine Ness, the wife of US Treasury Prohibition agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner). Clarkson stated she was struggling financially at the time, paying student loans, and De Palma expanded her role in the film; she originally had only several days of shooting. The next year, she played opposite Clint Eastwood in &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; (1988), the fifth installment in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film series.

Clarkson returned to Broadway in 1989 in &quot;Eastern Standard&quot;, portraying a Wall Street investment counselor whose brother (played by Kevin Conroy) is diagnosed with AIDS; the play ran from January to March of that year.

Clarkson has stated that in the early 1990s, she went through a turbulent period in her career and was unable to find significant work. She had a small role in &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1995) before being cast in the independent drama &quot;High Art&quot; (1998), portraying a drug-addicted German actress in New York City. Her performance earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

In 1998, Clarkson had a small role in the critically acclaimed independent romantic comedy &quot;Playing By Heart&quot;, playing a woman at a bar who listens to a false story told by a man (Dennis Quaid) as part of his improv class. In 1999, Clarkson appeared in a supporting role as an ailing wife of a prison warden in &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, which was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble Cast. The same year, she had a supporting part in the romantic comedy &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; (1999), followed by a supporting part in Stanley Tucci&#x27;s biopic &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot; (2000).

She also had a leading role in the independent horror film &quot;Wendigo&quot; (2001), directed by Larry Fessenden, and in the comedy &quot;Welcome to Collinwood&quot; (2002). Roger Ebert praised the performances in the former, noting: &quot;The actors [in &quot;Wendigo&quot;] have an unforced, natural quality that looks easy but is hard to do.&quot; In 2001 she had a recurring role on &quot;Frasier&quot; as Claire French, who dated Frasier Crane played by Kelsey Grammer.

===Critical breakthrough===
In 2002, Clarkson was cast in a supporting role in Todd Haynes&#x27;s period drama &quot;Far from Heaven&quot;, opposite Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid, playing the neighbor of a repressed housewife in the 1950s. The same year, she starred as Margaret White in the television film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot;. Between 2002 and 2005, Clarkson had a guest-starring role on the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, playing Sarah O&#x27;Connor, the artist sister of Ruth Fisher. For her portrayal, she won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Clarkson appeared in multiple independent films in 2003, including &quot;The Baroness and the Pig&quot;; Lars von Trier&#x27;s experimental drama &quot;Dogville&quot;, the critically acclaimed indie film &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, playing an artist who befriends a diminutive man (Peter Dinklage) who suddenly appears as a town resident living in a local train depot; &quot;Pieces of April&quot;, in which she portrayed a mother dying of cancer who travels to visit her estranged daughter (Katie Holmes) for Thanksgiving; and the David Gordon Green-directed drama &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;, as the mother of a young womanizer in a small southern town. Four of the films&quot;The Baroness and the Pig&quot;, &quot;Pieces of April&quot;, &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, and &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. Clarkson received numerous accolades for her performances: For &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, she won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance, and was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, among others. Her performance in &quot;Pieces of April&quot; earned her a Sundance Special Jury Prize, as well as nominations for the Screen Actors Guild award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Following these critical successes, Clarkson had a lead role opposite Kurt Russell in the sports docudrama &quot;Miracle&quot; (2004), about the U.S. hockey team defeating the heavily favored Soviets in the 1980 Olympics, and played the wife of a news correspondent (Robert Downey Jr.) in George Clooney&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005), about the conflict between journalist Edward R. Murrow and Joseph McCarthy. She then starred as the wife of a Hollywood studio executive in the independent drama &quot;The Dying Gaul&quot; (2005). 2006 saw the release of &quot;The Woods&quot;, a supernatural horror film shot in 2003 in which she portrayed the headmistress of a girls&#x27; boarding school.

In 2007, she had a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;No Reservations&quot;, as well as in the comedy-drama &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot;, in which she portrayed a psychiatrist treating a man in love with a sex doll. She subsequently co-starred with Ben Kingsley in the drama &quot;Elegy&quot; (2008), and had supporting roles in two Woody Allen films: 2008&#x27;s &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot;, portraying an unhappy housewife, and 2009&#x27;s &quot;Whatever Works&quot;. In 2008, producer Gerald Peary approached Clarkson to do the voice-over for the documentary film &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot;. Says Peary, &quot;She agreed to do the narration...  And she was so nice, and so cooperative, and so prepared, and so intelligent. And one of the key reasons she wanted to do the movie was that she regularly reads criticism, and has a genuine respect for film criticism. Clarkson returned to New Orleans on January 17, 2009 for the reopening of the Mahalia Jackson Theatre for the Performing Arts. She served as master of ceremonies for a gala featuring Plácido Domingo in concert with the New Orleans Opera, conducted by Robert Lyall. She also made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Digital Short &quot;Motherlover&quot; on May 9, 2009. The video featured Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, and Susan Sarandon. She reprised the role on May 21, 2011, in the digital short &quot;3-Way (The Golden Rule)&quot;.

===Mainstream success===
In 2010, Clarkson appeared opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese-directed thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, playing a woman escaped from a psychiatric institution. Recounting being cast in the part, Clarkson said: &quot;I got the call that every actor lives for. &#x27;Patty, Martin Scorsese is thinking of casting you in his new movie.&#x27; And I do what I call the little &#x27;Martin Scorsese dance&#x27; around my apartment. I think I was in my underwear or pajamas. It&#x27;s a call you live for. Then I hear back, &#x27;But it&#x27;s just one scene.&#x27; So then I&#x27;m dancing a little lower. Then I hear, &#x27;It&#x27;s you and Leonardo DiCaprio in a cave,&#x27; and then I&#x27;m dancing again.&quot; The film was a box office hit, and Scorsese&#x27;s highest-grossing film at the time.

Clarkson subsequently had roles in two independent films: &quot;Legendary&quot; and &quot;Main Street&quot; (both 2010), before appearing in two mainstream comedies directed by Will Gluck: &quot;Easy A&quot; (2010), as the mother of a troubled high school student (Emma Stone), and as the mother of an executive recruiter (Mila Kunis) in &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot; (2011). She also appeared in the romantic drama &quot;One Day&quot; (2011) as the mother of a college student in Scotland (portrayed by Jim Sturgess), and guest-starred on two episodes of the comedy series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. In 2013, she had a supporting role in the thriller &quot;The East&quot; (2013) as the leader of a private intelligence firm.

The same year, she starred opposite Ben Kingsley in the comedy-drama film &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;, portraying Wendy, a depressed middle-aged New York book critic learning to drive from a Sikh man. John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised her performance, writing: &quot;Clarkson gives us every ounce of Wendy&#x27;s desperation and self-loathing, and every shade of them as well. She has always been a miraculous performer.&quot; The same year, she appeared as villain Ava Paige in the major box-office hit &quot;The Maze Runner&quot;, a dystopian film based on the 2009 young adult novel. She subsequently reprised the role in both sequels: &quot;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials&quot; (2015), and &quot;Maze Runner: The Death Cure&quot; (2018).

Clarkson starred in the ensemble drama &quot;The Party&quot; in 2017, directed by Sally Potter, for which she won a British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.

For her performance in the series, Clarkson won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

She listed it for $2.5million (equivalent to $million in ) in November 2018.

<text>Anthony Van Egmond (born Antonij Jacobi Willem Gijben, 10 March 17785 January 1838) was purportedly a Dutch Napoleonic War veteran. He became one of the first settlers and business people in the Huron Tract in present-day southwestern Ontario Canada. Van Egmond became an early contractor employed by the Canada Company to construct the original road into the new settlement, allowing the entry of settlers for the purchase of company lands and further economic development. He eventually became a supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie and led a force of armed rebels in their unsuccessful skirmish at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern near Toronto on 7 December 1837, during the Upper Canada Rebellion.

==Life==
Anthony van Egmond was born in Groesbeek in the Netherlands, the son of Johannes Arnoldus Gijben and his wife Maria Bloem. When he was twelve years old, his father was murdered. Alleged criminal activity forced him to flee around 1795 to Germany, where he assumed another identity, which included adoption of a false claim of descent from the Van Egmonds, an aristocratic family of the Netherlands. In 1819, attracted by the prospect of purchasing land from the Holland Land Company, he travelled, via Amsterdam, Liverpool, and Philadelphia, to Indiana, Pennsylvania. The land, which he purchased in 1826, was eventually seized and sold at auction to cover unpaid taxes.

== The Canada Company ==
In 1828 he emigrated to Oxford Township East, in Upper Canada, where he purchased 200 acres (809,000 m2) of land from the Canada Company. Because of the establishment of a personal friendship with local company official John Galt, Van Egmond came to the attention of other Canada Company executives and was subsequently employed by the company as the initial primary contractor for road construction in the Huron Tract. Van Egmond was also charged with establishing a series of inns to be positioned at twenty mile (32 km) intervals along the Huron Road, which were to act as nightly stopping and resupplying points for the arriving settlers.

Although Van Egmond continued to complete his contractual obligations to the Canada Company, he continually resented that the Company insisted on paying all fees in the form of one-third cash and two-thirds company &#x27;land credits&#x27;, redeemable in exchange for parcels of land already owned by the company. Van Egmond found himself having to expend his own funds in order to achieve Canada Company development goals. At that time, the land credits he was paid with were only immediately redeemable in cash for a fraction of their stated value, because of the undeveloped condition of the lands involved. Because of this arrangement, by the early 1830s, Van Egmond had personally accumulated of land in the Huron Tract, including located in the central area of what is today the city of Stratford, Ontario. In August 1830, Van Egmond&#x27;s wife, Marie Susanne Elizabeth Dietz Van Egmond, ceremonially cut and bound the first sheaf of wheat harvested in the Huron Tract, at a gathering on their family farm on the Huron Road, which included local Canada Company officials and other regional businessmen.

Van Egmond became increasingly disgruntled at what he perceived as the Canada Company&#x27;s failure to expend obligated amounts of money from the Huron Tract Improvement Fund for the development of local roads and other infrastructure, as well as at what he believed was the company&#x27;s disregard for the general well-being of the arriving settlers. It&#x27;s interesting to note that Van Egmond&#x27;s views appear to be at least partially vindicated by an uncompleted judicial review conducted by Justice Jonas T.W. Jones in 1840. In his report Jones upheld Van Egmond&#x27;s position that the Canada Company&#x27;s practice of paying debts, partially in cash and partially in &#x27;land credits&#x27;, did not abide with the terms of the company&#x27;s original purchase agreement, when they acquired the lands from the Crown.

== Reform politics ==

Van Egmond began to voice his concerns by corresponding with William Lyon Mackenzie, a radical reformer who published a newspaper, the Colonial Advocate, in Upper Canada&#x27;s capital York. In January 1835, Van Egmond organized the Huron Union Society which met in the homes of recent settlers in the region. Its purpose was primarily to agitate for changes to Canada Company&#x27;s policies and business practices in the Huron District, however their stated aims also included demands for a more responsible government in the province, where control of public revenues would be in the hands of elected, rather than appointed officials. The Society also called for the immediate sale of all remaining Clergy reserves and an end to what they saw as government sponsored monopolies, such as the Canada Company itself. It was also in 1835, that Van Egmond was nominated in the recently created District of Huron as the Reform candidate in an election to be held in 1836 for a seat in the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada in Toronto. He was defeated in that election by Robert Graham Dunlop from Goderich, Ontario, the brother of William &quot;Tiger&quot; Dunlop .

== Rebellion and confinement==

Frustrated by what he saw as a failure to address important issues on the part of both the Canada Company and the so-called Family Compact he began a period of much more involvement with William Lyon Mackenzie and participation in more extreme forms of politics. It&#x27;s possible that Mackenzie based his appointment of Van Egmond as military leader for a planned open rebellion to begin at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern near Toronto in December 1837, on Van Egmond&#x27;s possibly exaggerated past claims of having gained actual combat experience in the Napoleonic wars in Europe.

It is indicated in sources that on the day of the actual engagement at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern, Van Egmond advised William Lyon Mackenzie that their military cause was &quot;hopeless&quot; and advised him to retreat from the situation. Mackenzie is purported to have threatened Van Egmond&#x27;s life if he failed to proceed with their plan. After being routed in the engagement by government armed forces, Van Egmond was arrested and confined to a small prison cell in Toronto. Suffering from a possible combination of malnutrition, pneumonia and exposure, Van Egmond became seriously ill in confinement and was transferred to a nearby hospital where he died on 5 January 1838. Subsequent to his death, Van Egmond&#x27;s substantial real estate holdings, apart from the original family farm, were seized by the colonial government, purportedly as punishment for his participation in the uprising. Van Edgmond is buried at Egmondville Cemetery in Egmondville, Ontario.

The community of Egmondville, now incorporated within the community of Seaforth in the Municipality of Huron East was founded in Van Egmond&#x27;s honour in 1845, by his eldest son Constant.

<text>The Mardi Gras Indians (also known as Black Masking Indians or Black Maskers) are African American carnival revelers in New Orleans, Louisiana, known for their elaborate suits and participation in Mardi Gras. The Mardi Gras Indians subculture emerged during the era of slavery from West African, Afro-Caribbean and Native American cultural practices. The Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; tradition is considered part of the African diasporan decorative aesthetic, and is an African-American art form.

The Mardi Gras Indian tradition developed as a form of cultural resistance when traditional African religions were banned and Black people could not gather in public or wear masks. Their aesthetic serves as an expression of their culture, religion and spirituality. The tradition of &quot;masking&quot; derives from the West African masquerade ceremony, in which an individual takes on the role of a god or spirit. Some Mardi Gras Indians mask as the Native American allies who shielded their ancestors during slavery; others mask as orisha spirits from the Yoruba religion, or as spirits of the dead, such as the Skull and Bones gangs. Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; suits (regalia) and performances provide commentary on social justice issues, political liberation, and transformation. Their ceremonial purposes include healing, protection from the unknown, and communion with the spirits.

Mardi Gras Indians call their krewes &quot;tribes&quot; or &quot;gangs&quot;, which should not be confused with Native American tribes. Tribes takes their names from street names, ancestry and important cultural figures. There are more than 40 active tribes, which range in size from half a dozen to several dozen members. Groups are largely independent, but a pair of umbrella organizations loosely coordinates the Uptown Indians and the Downtown Indians. Their suits are displayed in museums in Louisiana and the Smithsonian. The complex designs of these suits are unique to the Mardi Gras Indian artistic community.

In addition to Mardi Gras Day, many of the tribes also parade on Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (March 19) and the Sunday nearest to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (&quot;Super Sunday&quot;). Traditionally, these were the only times Mardi Gras Indians were seen in public in full regalia. The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival began the practice of hiring tribes to appear at the Festival as well. In recent years, it has become more common to see Mardi Gras Indians at other festivals and parades in the city. According to Joyce Marie Jackson of Tulane University, the Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; fusion of American Indian and West African motifs and music creates &quot;a folk ritual and street theater unique to New Orleans&quot;.

==History==

Mardi Gras Indians have been practicing their traditions in New Orleans since at least the 18th century. The colony of New Orleans was founded by the French in 1718, on land inhabited by the Chitimacha Tribe, and within the first decade 5,000 enslaved Africans were trafficked to the colony. The West-Central African ethnic groups taken to Louisiana during the transatlantic slave trade were Bambara, Gambian, Akan, Fon, Yoruba, and Kongolese peoples. From 1719 to 1743, almost 30 percent of African people imported to New Orleans came from Ouidah, a port in Dahomey on the Bight of Benin. The largest group came from Senegambia. These ethnic groups influenced the culture of Louisiana in food, music, language, religion, and decorative aesthetics. French slaveholders allowed enslaved and free Black people to congregate on Sunday afternoons at Congo Square, where they performed music and religious practices. 

New Orleans is known for its Creole heritage, with traditions coming from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans. A mixed-race population of free people of color contributed to the history and culture of Mardi Gras in the city. The culture of enslaved Africans fused with Afro-Caribbean, Native American and European cultures that syncretized at Congo Square and was practiced during Mardi Gras. The Mardi Gras Indian tradition developed from early encounters between the region&#x27;s Indigenous (likely Chitimacha) and Black communities. Most of the enslaved people in Louisiana were Black, but 20% of enslaved people were either Native or mixed-race Afro-Indigenous people before abolition.

===Black–Indigenous alliances===

When enslaved Africans escaped, they encountered Indigenous peoples of Louisiana who shared skills and resources with them. New Orleans was surrounded by swamps, bayous, and rivers where a number of maroon settlements formed. In Louisiana, the Underground Railroad went south to maroon camps because the northern free territories and Canada were too far. These maroon camps attacked whites, stole cattle from nearby farms for food, and freed or absorbed other enslaved people. The maroons lived in huts and grew their own food of corn, squash, rice, and herbs. African culture thrived in maroon communities, and Native Americans often helped them by providing food and weapons to defend themselves from whites and slave catchers. 

In colonial Louisiana, there was a settlement known as Natanapalle of armed maroons and Indigenous peoples. In such spaces, freed and escaped Africans adapted some of the culture of Native Americans. Whites in Louisiana feared an alliance of Africans and Indigenous people. 

In 1729, 280 enslaved Africans joined forces with Natchez people during the &quot;Natchez Revolt&quot; to prevent French colonists from taking Indigenous land for tobacco production. The Natchez killed almost all of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape, some fleeing to New Orleans. The Natchez spared the enslaved Africans, perhaps due to an affinity between the Natchez and the Africans. Some slaves joined the Natchez, while others took the chance to escape to freedom.

Until the mid-1760s, maroon colonies lined the shores of Lake Borgne, just downriver of New Orleans. The maroons controlled many of the canals and back-country passages from Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico, including the Rigolets. The San Malo community was a long-thriving autonomous community. These settlements were eventually eradicated by Spanish militia led by Francisco Bouligny. Despite this, people who escaped enslavement in ante-bellum America continued to find refuge and freedom in the areas around New Orleans.

===The first Mardi Gras===

The first recorded slave dances on plantations in Louisiana were recorded by the French in 1732. Archival records documented the first enslaved Africans apparently dressing as Indigenous people in a celebratory dance called &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; in 1746. In 1771, free men of color held Mardi Gras in maroon camps and in the city&#x27;s back areas. Some of these men wore their masks to balls, causing the Spanish administration to grant &quot;a prohibition of black persons from being masked, wearing feathers, and attending nightballs. This forced them to dress and roam only in the black neighborhoods and Congo Square.&quot; Author and photographer Michael P. Smith quotes Brassea and stating: &quot;By 1781, under Spanish rule, the attorney general warned the City Commission of problems arising from &#x27;a great number of free negroes and slaves who, with the pretext of the Carnival season, mask and mix in bands passing through the streets looking for the dance-halls.&#x27;&quot; In 1804 and 1813, a German American and Swiss traveler saw Black men dressed in oriental and Native American attire wearing Turkish turbans of various colors.

In the late 18th century, Spanish officials increased immigration and trade in the lower Mississippi valley by granting French merchants permission to import enslaved people from Saint-Domingue and other Caribbean islands. American merchants in New Orleans invested in capital by importing enslaved people from British colonies such as Jamaica. After the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 1807, the port of New Orleans became the center of the slave trade in the United States before the American Civil War. Enslaved people were brought from other southern states to supply the demand for labor on the plantations. In addition, during and after the Haitian Revolution, enslavers fled the island of Hispaniola, bringing their enslaved Africans with them to New Orleans.

In 1810, free and enslaved Haitian refugees came to New Orleans from Cuba, thus doubling the local enslaved population and tripling the population of free people of color. The port received immigrants from Cuba, Germany, Ireland, and the rest of the Caribbean. Carnival cultures from Haiti, Jamaica and other parts of the West Indies blended with festival traditions in local Black communities. Influences such as Jonkonnu, Rara, Gaga, Canboulet, and others came from the West Indies.

===Exclusion and subversion===

In 1857, The Pickwick Club, an all-white gentleman&#x27;s club, formed the Mystick Krewe of Comus, a white-only carnival krewe. They were soon followed by similar all-white, men-only krewes across the city. These groups often wore blackface and redface, and took part in public celebrations as well as private balls. Black people were initially forbidden from wearing masks during carnival; in response, groups of young Black men used &quot;war paint&quot; to hide their identities instead. After the state legislature allowed masking &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot;, Black people began masking according to the style of West African masquerade ceremonies. 

By the 1880s, Becate Batiste, a young creole man of African, French and Choctaw heritage formed the Creole Wild West, in Seventh Ward. Others soon formed their own &quot;tribes&quot;. Their visual style, drawing from African and Indigenous traditions, served to satirize and invert the racist masquerades of white krewes. It also allowed Black people, whose African culture had been suppressed by slave laws and the Code Noir, to practice their traditions openly.

===Hurricane Katrina===
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed African-American neighborhoods in New Orleans. Tremé is considered to be the oldest Black neighborhood in America and during post-Katrina continues to experience gentrification. From the 18th and 19th centuries, free Black people owned businesses and mixed with Haitian immigrants at Tremé. It is estimated that Black people owned eighty percent of the neighborhood. After Hurricane Katrina passed through, over 1,000 Black households along Clairborne Avenue were wiped-out and replaced with 120 white households. According to research from author Shearon Roberts, the changing of racial demographics in post-Katrina affects the continuation of culture for some Black residents. Occupation by white residents of spaces that were once Black-owned and where Black masking and cultural traditions were perpetuated resulted in three consequences: &quot;...economic loss through appropriation, increased forms of criminalization, and the rupturing of Black safe communal spaces.&quot; Black New Orleanians experience cultural intrusion and appropriation from outsiders that affects the meaning and history of their traditions.

==Culture==

Experts generally agree that Mardi Gras Indian culture is a combination of African, Caribbean, Indigenous, and European influences, which underwent a process of creolization and syncretism in New Orleans. For instance, the beadwork, drumbeats, and aprons worn by Mardi Gras Indians resembles the cultures of West and Central Africa. The masking of the Mardi Gras Indians resembles West African masquerade ceremonies and warrior dances, but also draws on Indigenous motifs. The closest comparisons are between Caribbean carnival cultures—some scholars have even suggested New Orleans should be considered part of the pan-Caribbean region because of its shared heritage. 

Black masking traditions were sustained by African Americans despite colonialism, slavery, Black Codes, and racism. After the French required Black people to convert to Catholicism, African and Christian religious traditions were combined to continue traditional practices from African religions without notice. For enslaved and free Africans in the Americas, this included singing, dancing, drumming, and wearing masks and costumes at carnival. In its early history, masking culture resembled the all-male West African secret masquerade societies practiced among the Igbo and Yoruba. As Black people continued to practice their traditional cultures, they also incorporated Native American and Caribbean elements, in turn creating the diverse Black masking carnival traditions in the diaspora and in New Orleans.

Scholars Fehintola Mosadomi and Joyce M. Jackson noted similar ceremonial practices of the Yoruba Egungun and Mardi Gras Indians—both are performed in the streets with music and folk rituals, have elaborate colorful costumes, and are male-dominated. Masking Indian culture is a rite of passage for Black men and provides manhood and comrade training. Women&#x27;s role in the tradition was, historically, as embellishment, but over the years, women began to participate too.

Black people in the African diaspora have traditionally used masquerade carnivals to protest oppression. Black carnivals provide a space for African Americans to unite, free from exploitation by white Americans. Mardi Gras Indian culture is a form of Black creative resistance to the white supremacy of colonialism and represents a rejection of white carnival norms.

===Language===
Mardi Gras Indians today have their own secret coded symbols, songs and language only initiates within the community know. In the 19th century, Creole dialects developed differently within each neighborhood because of the diversity of African languages spoken, each having its own syntax and phonetics. This contributed to a diversity of coded dialects sung by Black masking Indians.

===Music===

Mardi Gras Indian music and dance is informed by the Black New Orleanian experience. In 1740, New Orleans&#x27; Congo Square was a cultural center for African music and dance; the city was also a major southern trade port that became a cultural melting pot. On Sundays, enslaved African people gathered to sing folk songs, play traditional music, and dance. The lively parties were recounted by a Northern observer as being &quot;indescribable... Never will you see gayer countenances, demonstrations of more forgetfulness of the past and the future, and more entire abandonment to the joyous existence of the present moment.&quot;

On these occasions, Mardi Gras Indians would play traditional music using belled wrists and ankle bands, congas, and tambourines. The music of Mardi Gras Indians played at Congo square contributed to the creation of jazz. Mardi Gras Indian music is derived from African polyrhythms and syncopated beats combined with African and Creole languages, and French and European musical influences. These African rhythms, such as the Bamboula, have been continued to this day. The traditional New Orleans Black masking Indian song &quot;Iko Iko&quot;, which emerged around this time, is believed to derive from a combination of the Native American Choctaw and Chickasaw languages, Louisiana Creole, French, and West African languages. 

Black Masking Indian parades typically have a &quot;second line&quot; of street performers and revelers with brass instruments and drums. These second line brass bands often attend local jazz funerals to play for the funeral procession. Historian Richard Brent Turner says that Central African cultures from Bakongo peoples, Haitian carnivals, and Black American culture which blended at Congo Square are expressed in the Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; regalia and music. Mardi Gras Indian musicians include the funk band Cha Wa, singer and &quot;Big Chief&quot; Monk Boudreau, and The Wild Tchoupitoulas.

=== Spirituality ===
The Code Noir in French colonies banned all non-Catholic religions and required enslaved and free people to convert to Catholicism. Curator and author Paulette Richards suggests that masquerade performances in the Black Atlantic during and after slavery, in which African and Christian religious traditions were combined, were a way for African peoples in the Americas to continue honoring their ancestral spirits after colonial officials had banned Black people from practicing African religions. Many maskers describe masking as aiming &quot;to enter the spirit world of possession&quot;. During jazz funerals, spirits control the bodies of the dancers so the spirit of the deceased can transition peacefully. During Mardi Gras, the masks symbolize spirituality and freedom.

Mardi Gras Indians often form second lines for jazz funerals in Black neighborhoods, marching behind the coffin and mourners. The music is typically somber when they head to church, but becomes celebratory when leaving the church. These funerals feature African customs such as intense drumming, dancing, and call-and-response. Similar funeral processions are seen in West African, Afro-Caribbean, and Afro-Brazilian communities. Mardi Gras Indians also perform healing rituals during their street performances to unite and heal communities. 

Before a Mardi Gras Indian observance begins a prayer or chant is said in Louisiana Creole. The song &quot;Madi cu defio, en dans day&quot; is sung; it is a corruption of a Louisiana Voodoo Creole song, &quot;M&#x27;alle couri dans deser&quot;, associated with the Afro-Caribbean dance called Calinda. Calinda (or Kalinda) developed in the Caribbean, and was brought to New Orleans by enslaved people from San Domingo and the Antilles. In New Orleans, Calinda became &quot;the dance of Congo Square&quot;, and was integrated into Mardi Gras Indian traditions. 

====Spiritual church movement====


Mardi Gras Indians attend Spiritual churches because of a shared interest in the history of Native American resistance and spirit possession. Mardi Gras Indians also attract churchgoers when they perform ring shout dances with percussion in inner city clubs. In New Orleans, the Spiritual church movement was influenced by Louisiana Voodoo, folk Catholicism, Protestantism, Spiritualism, Bakongo and Nkisi culture, and other African diaspora religions such as Espiritismo and Palo Mayombe. Native American images were incorporated into the practices of New Orleans Spiritual churches as early as 1852. 

After Leafy Anderson moved to New Orleans in 1920, many Spiritual churches introduced traditions associated with Mardi Gras Indians, including summoning the spirits of Native American resistance leaders such as Black Hawk, White Eagle, Red Cloud, and White Hawk. Anderson wore a Native American chief&#x27;s mantle during her services to call the spirit of Black Hawk, her favorite spirit guide, who today symbolizes protest and empowerment for the marginalized women in the churches. This summoning tradition continued into the late 20th century. In the 1980s, James Anderson wore the suit of deceased tribal member Big Chief Jolley to a Black Hawk ceremony at Infant Jesus of Prague Spiritual Church. One church minister reportedly dressed as a Mardi Gras Indian to summon the spirits of Black Hawk and Reverend Adams, resulting in a &quot;séance&quot;. Many Spiritual churches have altars to Indigenous figures, Catholic saints, ancestors, Archangel Michael, and other spirits. In one Spiritual church, a three-foot-high Indian statue is decorated with a Mardi Gras Indian headdress and bead patches. 

===African diasporan influences===
Scholars have noted the similar musical, dance, and regalia practices of Black people across the African diaspora. The arrival of Haitian slaves during the Haitian Revolution and Dominican slaves in 1809 brought Caribbean carnival culture to the Black Americans of New Orleans. Many of the Dominicans had Yoruba ancestry, and their masquerade culture of Egungun syncretized with the culture of New Orleans enslaved communities. 

By the 20th century, more Haitian immigrants settled in Louisiana where some elements of rara festival culture blended with Black American carnivals. When other Afro-Caribbean communities started to settle in New Orleans, their culture was incorporated into the suits, dances and music, too.

Historian Jeroen Dewulf describes similar masking traditions—where Black people dress as Indigenous people—in Cuba, Peru, Trinidad, and Brazil. Feathered headdresses are worn in the Americas and by Kongo people in Central Africa. In African and Native American cultures, feathers have a spiritual meaning; they elevate the wearer&#x27;s spirit and connect them to the spirit realm. Kongo people wear feathered headdresses in ceremonies and festivals; they are worn by African chiefs and dancers; and feathers are placed on Traditional African masks to bring in good medicine. These practices continued in the Americas. The designs of African headdresses blended with headdresses worn by Indigenous people, creating unique styles across the diaspora.

Mardi Gras Indian performances tell a story about their ancestors escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad. Author Natalie Medea describes the Young Seminole Hunters, a tribe which sculpts elaborate suits to honor the roles the Seminole people had in liberating enslaved Black people.

====Carnival culture in the diaspora====


Many Pan-American carnivals in the African diaspora have performances and regalia which resemble those of Mardi Gras Indians, such as:

*Second Line Parades - New Orleans and Cuba
*Ruberos groups – Cuba
*Escolas de Samba, Capoeira – Brazil
* Maracatu parades- Brazil
*Rara festival – Haiti
*19th Century Jametta Carnival – Trinidad
* Trinidad and Tobago Carnival
*Jokonnu – West Indies
*Sociedad de las Congas – Panama
*French Guiana
*L&#x27;agya – Martinique

====Masquerade====
Black masking traditions in New Orleans are a combination of Caribbean and African folk art that was sustained by African Americans as &quot;an expression of Black resistance to [a] white supremacist environment&quot; and a rejection of white carnival norms. Author Raphael Njoku says: &quot;While masquerading is reminiscent of the communal sociopolitical structures in precolonial Africa, the African Diaspora masked carnivals challenged the political powers and interests of the dominant White elite.&quot;

For many Black people, Mardi Gras—and masking in particular—is a cultural and a spiritual experience with strong ties to the African diaspora. Some Black masking Indians describe a &quot;successful&quot; masking experience as including &quot;a sensation of being possessed&quot;. Masking Indian Chief Zulu says: &quot;Once you put a mask on, you&#x27;re not a person any more. You become the energy or entity of what it is you&#x27;re masking.&quot; Mardi Gras Indian Albert Lambreaux describes transforming into &quot;Big Chief&quot; when he wears his suit. As Big Chief he becomes an authority in the community. This change of identity only occurs during Mardi Gras when Black maskers wear their regalia. This is a continuation of Sub-Saharan African masking traditions where a person&#x27;s identity changes when they mask; the masks invite the gods to possess the individual, take them to another plane of existence, or relay messages to the community.

While the tradition began as a male right of passage, as were the masquerade traditions in West and Central Africa, today many Black women partake in this tradition as well. Cherice Harrison-Nelson says partaking in the Mardi Gras Indian tradition was a spiritual and personal choice. Five generations of her family have masked as Indians. Harrison-Nelson notes the similar cultural practices of Mardi Gras Indians and West Africans in the music, polyrhythms, and regalia. She says: &quot;I would say this tradition is an African-American community neighborhood-based tradition that often uses a Native American motif, which includes the feather headdresses and beadwork. But basically, everything else about it is West African.&quot;

From the 1960s, Mardi Gras Indians began to intentionally incorporate more imagery from African cultures and African diaspora religions in their regalia.

====War dances====
In the 1720s, the dance called Calinda (or Kalinda) developed in the Caribbean, based on African martial arts. It was brought to New Orleans by enslaved people from San Domingo and the Antilles. In Haiti and Trinidad, Calinda was a form of stick fighting and was performed during carnivals by the enslaved. In New Orleans, it became a voodoo dance and &quot;the dance of Congo Square&quot;. The Calinda dance was integrated into Mardi Gras Indian traditions. Other dance influences were the chica, an Afro-Caribbean dance, and bamboula, an African derived dance, that were performed at Congo Square by free and enslaved people.

The performances of Mardi Gras Indians also display influences from mock-war performances by warriors called &quot;sangamento&quot; from the Kingdom of Kongo. The word is derived from a verb in the Kikongo language, &quot;ku-sanga&quot;, denoting ecstatic dancers. In Portuguese ku-sanga became sangamento. Kongo people in Central Africa performed dances decorated in African feather headdresses and wore belts with jingle bells. Sangamento performers dance using leaps, contortions, and gyrations, similar to the dance styles of Mardi Gras Indians. During the transatlantic slave trade, Bantu people were enslaved in the Americas. Sangamentos were a brotherhood of men with a semi-underground culture that resembles the Mardi Gras Indian tradition at Congo Square. Scholars at Duke University found that Kongo peoples&#x27; culture influenced African diaspora religions, Afro-American music, and the dance and musical styles of Mardi Gras Indians.

=== Indigenous cultural influences ===

Masking Indians honor the assistance given their ancestors by incorporating American Indian symbols into their carnivals. Native American resistance is also a key theme in Mardi Gras Indian performances. Black Mardi Gras Indians tell these stories of African–Indigenous solidarity through their regalia. Scholars have found reports of Native American motifs on costumes and in parades in New Orleans since the 18th century, though Mardi Gras Indians began to incorporate more imagery from African cultures and African diaspora religions into their regalia from the 1960s.

During the late 1740s and 1750s, many enslaved Africans fled to the bayous of Louisiana where they encountered Native Americans. The Underground Railroad went through several Native American communities (local tribes included the Chitimacha, Natchez, Houma, Atakapa, and Tunica). In 1729, 280 enslaved Africans joined the Natchez to resist the French in the Natchez revolt. During these contacts, Black people adopted elements of local Native culture and blended it with their own West African and Afro-Caribbean traditions. The Chitimacha were the first to make a public musical procession in New Orleans called Marche du Calumet de Paix; this practice was likely inspired similar processions by Black New Orleanians, who gathered at Congo Square. Accounts describe Black gangs dressed as &quot;Native American militia&quot; as early as 1836. A source from 1849 refers to Black performers on Congo Square fully covered in &quot;the plumes of the peacock&quot;.

From 1884 to 1885, &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show wintered in New Orleans, and had a multicultural cast and crew of Black, Chinese, Mexican, European and Indigenous people. Some scholars suggest the show may have been an indirect influence on the Mardi Gras Indians. Michael P. Smith suggests that, given the racial conditions in New Orleans at the time, these shows would have galvanized local Black audiences to identify with the plight of the Native Americans and see a shared enemy in white supremacy. Ann Dupont believes this &quot;rekindled&quot; the &quot;allegiance and affinity&quot; between Black people and Native Americans. In 1885, the first recorded Mardi Gras Indian gang was formed by Becate Batiste, a putative Black Indian; the tribe was named &quot;The Creole Wild West&quot;. Though the New Orleans traditions of Black masking predate Buffalo Bill&#x27;s show, Smith suggests the name of Batiste&#x27;s tribe may have been an intentional response to it. That same year, 50 to 60 Plains Indians reportedly also marched in native dress for Mardi Gras. Towards the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the presence of Native American ancestor worship in the city&#x27;s Spiritual church movement may also have influenced Mardi Gras Indian traditions.

The use of some Native American motifs, such as in the names for tribes or gangs, has begun to decline among some Mardi Gras Indians; alternate names for the subculture have also been suggested, such as &quot;Black Maskers&quot; and the &quot;Maroons of Urban New Orleans&quot;. Some tribes have removed the words &quot;Indian Red&quot; from their music. Author Michael Smith says that &quot;Indian Red&quot; is a Mardi Gras Indian prayer song that honors various gang members past and present, and calls for peace and justice. Andrew Pearse suggests the origins of &quot;Indian Red&quot; comes from a carnival song in Trinidad, &quot;Indurubi&quot;, which may have come from the Spanish &quot;Indio Rubi&quot; (&quot;Indian Red&quot;).

==Suits==


Mardi Gras Indian suits cost thousands of dollars in materials alone and can weigh upwards of . A suit usually takes between six and nine months to plan and complete, but can take up to a year. Mardi Gras Indians design and create their own suits; elaborate bead patches depict meaningful and symbolic scenes. Beads, feathers, and sequins are integral parts of a Mardi Gras Indian suit. The beadwork is entirely done by hand and features a combination of color and texture. The suits incorporate volume, giving the clothing a sculptural sensibility. Uptown New Orleans tribes tend to have more pictorial and African-inspired suits; downtown tribes have more 3D suits with more Native American influences. The suits are revealed on Super Sunday. Some of the suits are displayed in museums throughout the country. 

Even though men are more numerous among the Mardi Gras Indians, women can become &quot;Queens&quot; who make their own regalia and masks. Author Cynthia Becker states the Mardi Gras Indian suits &quot;express people&#x27;s religious beliefs, historical pride, and racial heritage&quot;. Cherice Harrison-Nelson says her suits tell her family&#x27;s history—the story of an ancestor who was stolen and enslaved. Harrison-Nelson adds the Ghanaian Adinkra symbols to her suits to emphasize that the tradition has origins in West Africa. Tiara Horton, Queen of the 9th Ward Black Hatchet tribe, created a Black Lives Matter suit in 2020 before the murder of George Floyd, showing beaded images of Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, and the Obamas. For Horton, the Mardi Gras Indian tradition is her way of protesting. 

In 2024, to preserve this practice for younger generations, the Arts New Orleans&#x27; Young Artist Movement provided funding for local young Black artists to create Mardi Gras Indian suits.

===Cultural designs===

When making their suits, Mardi Gras Indians incorporate cultural designs from West African and North American Indigenous cultures, making their regalia a unique form of African-American folk art. Mardi Gras Indians initially decorated their ornaments with pearls, rhinestones, turkey feathers, fish scales, discarded beads, and sequins—along with their brightly colored ostrich feather headdresses, these can weigh over 150 pounds. Maskers have adopted a range of visual styles over the centuries, such as those in 1781 who were banned for &quot;exhibitions against the public quietness&quot; or those from the 1823 carnival who wore crowns of gold oblong boxes stacked on their heads. In 1804 and 1813, a German American and Swiss traveler saw Black men in &quot;oriental and Indian dress&quot; wearing different colored Turkish turbans. Over the years, their suits became more elaborate and colorful and incorporated cultural elements from Africa. West African cultural elements include cowrie shells, kente cloth, raffia, and traditional face masks and shields. Researchers have described a Nigerian beading technique in &quot;Uptown styles&quot; while Bakongo influences are seen in the suits of &quot;Downtown styles.&quot;

====African diasporan influences====

Over the years, Mardi Gras Indians have increasingly incorporated designs from African and African diaspora cultures in their suits such as beadwork, conch shells, dried grass strands, and designs from Bahamian Junkanoo dancers. Victor Harris, a Black Louisianan, reflects the design work of Bambara and Mandinka cultures with the use of animistic designs, raffia, and feathers. 

After Emperor Haile Selassie I visited New Orleans in 1954, Rastafari influences also began to appear in suit designs. Demond Melancon incorporates Rasta colors (red, green, and gold) into his suit, and beads into his regalia historical people associated with the movement, such as the Ethiopian Emperor and his wife, Empress Menen Asfaw. By sewing these Black figures into his suits, he conjures their spirits. The Rastafari movement also inspired Eric Burt to bead cultural symbols from the religion. Some Black Mardi Gras Indians are Rastas and display this in their music and regalia.

Some Black maskers practice traditional African religions in their daily lives and incorporate this into Mardi Gras. Mystic Medicine Man of the Golden Feather Hunters tribe shows his Congo ancestry by sewing the word &quot;nganga&quot;, a word in Kikongo that means a spiritual and herbal healer in Central Africa, into his suits. Other Black masking tribes such as the Spirit of Fi Yi Yi and the Mandingo Warriors were founded to connect with African masquerade traditions. Members of this tribe mask as Elegba, an orisha (divine spirit) that rules communication and the crossroads. Dow Edwards displays his devotion to the orisha Shango in his suits as Spy Boy of the Mohawk Hunters. Black maskers also turn to the Yoruba religion for inspiration in their designs. They blend European parading traditions and fuse the Yoruba orisha Oshun sacred imagery with the designs of their suits. Other maskers adapt Pan-African, Black Power, and Egyptian iconography into their regalia. 

The Black Spiritual church movement in New Orleans in the 1920s may have influenced the regalia of Mardi Gras Indians. Some masking Indians practice Catholicism and blend Catholic saints, traditions, and feast days into their Caribbean and African religious practices during Mardi Gras. 

Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; suits also include sequined pouches inspired by healers in the Haitian Vodou community. Some masking Indians practice Louisiana Voodoo and incorporate symbols and colors from the religion into their suits. Ty Emmecca is a Big Chief of the Black Hawk Voodoo gang and his gang beads religious symbols from the religion into their regalia and performs Voodoo healing rituals during Mardi Gras. Emmecca makes patches for his suits that are similar to Haitian Vodou drapo, which are handsewn ceremonial sequin flags.

Islamic influences have also been observed in the tradition. During the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved West African Muslims were brought to New Orleans. In the 1960s, many Black people in the city practiced Islam for political and religious reasons. Two Black Masking Indians recently incorporated symbols and Islamic religious beliefs into their suits: Floyd Edwards made a breastplate with an apron honoring Mansa Musa, the 14th-century ruler of the Islamic Mali Empire; and Peteh Muhammad Haroon beaded an image of Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, and the Muslim symbols of a crescent and star.

Mardi Gras Indians design their suits to emphasize their ancestral connections to African and Afro-Caribbean cultures. They have preserved many of their West-Central African culture by way of decorative folk art, music, and dance. Historian of Black Studies Joseph E. Holloway states that carnivals in New Orleans resemble African-influenced festivals from the Caribbean. The continuation of African and Afro-Caribbean influences in Mardi Gras encourages a Pan-African identity among Black people in New Orleans because of the similar decorative designs seen in regalia across the Black diaspora.

Scholars also see Igbo masquerade dances in West Africa as another cultural influence in Mardi Gras Indian communities. Igbo masquerade dancers are an all-male fraternal organization. Egungun regalia also influenced the ceremonies and suits of Black Mardi Gras Indians. The Yoruba wear Egungun masks to invoke and honor ancestral spirits. The masks signify the souls of deceased relatives who return to earth to interact with their living descendants. This cultural influence is also shown in the images of ancestors and Black historical people beaded into Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; suits. Beading is often described as a spiritual experience for Black New Orleanians, who have described entering a meditative trance when sewing their suits.

====Native American influences====

Native American motifs are incorporated into the headdresses and feather designs of Mardi Gras Indian regalia. The Mardi Gras Indians take inspiration from Native American resistance and their fight against white U.S. cavalry soldiers. Some Mardi Gras Indians report that they call on the spirit of Sauk leader Black Hawk for peace and justice.

Some of the Mardi Gras Black Indians&#x27; regalia may be influenced by popular depictions of Native Americans and their cultures. For instance, Mardi Gras Indians sometimes wear war bonnets, even though the Indigenous people who helped enslaved Black Americans escape from slavery were from Southeastern Native American tribes that do not wear war bonnets. 

===Cultural preservation===

The Mardi Gras Indians traditions are considered a unique artform and ritual which represents New Orleans&#x27; Black culture. Curators are preserving the history of Mardi Gras Indians by displaying and storing their elaborate suits in museums. To preserve the suits, curators work with the makers to prevent damage. 

The Historic New Orleans Collections Museum has partnered with the city&#x27;s Black arts community to preserve their culture. Curator Loren Brown says of the process:

==Tribes==

Mardi Gras Indians organize in groups known as &quot;tribes&quot; (or &quot;gangs&quot;). Typically, they identify by tribe names, rather than as &quot;Mardi Gras Indians&quot; or &quot;Black Masking Indians&quot;. Scholars have described the Mardi Gras Indian tribes as spiritual secret societies, mutual-aid organizations, and social clubs. Group names are influenced by street names, ancestry and important cultural figures. For example, some Black Americans in New Orleans descend from Senegalese or Mandinka people in West Africa; others have some Native American ancestry. Tribes with &quot;Seminole&quot; in their name reflect stories of enslaved people who escaped slavery and found refuge in the Seminole Nation. Plains Indian names may be inspired by depictions of Native Americans in popular culture. During parades, some tribes are identified by their masks.

Groups are largely independent, but a pair of umbrella organizations loosely coordinates the Uptown Indians and the Downtown Indians. The Mardi Gras Indian Council coordinates between more than 40 active tribes, which range in size from half a dozen to several dozen members. Their suits are displayed in museums in Louisiana and the Smithsonian.

Traditionally, Mardi Gras Indians were only seen in public in full regalia on Mardi Gras Day, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (March 19) and the Sunday nearest to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (&quot;Super Sunday&quot;). In recent years, it has become more common to see Mardi Gras Indians at other festivals and parades in the city as well. For example, the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival has hired tribes to appear at their festival. 

===Parade formation and protocol===

The Mardi Gras Indians play various traditional roles. Many blocks ahead of the Indians are plain-clothed informants keeping an eye out for any danger. The procession begins with &quot;spyboys&quot;, dressed in light &quot;running suits&quot; that allow them the freedom to move quickly in case of emergency. Next comes the &quot;first flag&quot;, an ornately dressed Indian carrying a token flag in their gang colours. Closest to the &quot;Big Chief&quot; is the &quot;Wildman&quot; who usually carries a symbolic weapon. Finally, there is the Big Chief, who decides where to go and which tribes to meet (or ignore). The entire group is followed by a &quot;second line&quot; of percussionists and revelers. Traditionally, the second line would also have to protect the front line of paraders from violence.

During the march, the Indians dance and sing traditional songs particular to their individual tribes. They use creole dialects or patois, loosely based on different African and European languages. The Big Chief decides where the group will parade; the parade route is different each time. When two tribes come across each other, they either pass by or meet for a symbolic fight. Each tribe lines up and the Big Chiefs taunt each other about their suits and their tribes. The drum beats of the two tribes intertwine, and the face-off is complete. Both tribes continue on their way.

====Skull and Bones gangs====
The Northside Skull and Bones gang and other masking traditions continue at Treme during Mardi Gras. According to local oral history, the Skull and Bones Gangs started in 1819 in Treme. Black Maskers dress in black costumes with painted white skeleton bones to honor the dead and to caution the living that death is inevitable. Participants state that the tradition came to New Orleans by way of Caribbean and African cultures where the dead are honored in the Haitian Vodou religion. Skull and Bones masker Bruce &quot;Sunpie&quot; Barnes traveled to Africa and said he saw skeleton-like spirits and Voodoo markets. During Mardi Gras, Barnes recognizes the Guédé, a family of spirits in Haitian Vodou that are guardians of the cemetery. Skull and Bones gangs act as spiritual town guardians and carnival town criers. Jazz historian John McCusker found skeleton maskers were referenced in archives dating back to 1875. A 1902 local newspaper, &quot;Times-Democrat&quot;, referenced young Black maskers on the streets of North Claiborne Avenue, North Robertson and Annette.

====Conflict====

In the early days of the Mardi Gras Indians, masking and parading was also a time to settle grudges. This part of Mardi Gras Indian history is referenced in James Sugar Boy Crawford&#x27;s song, &quot;Jock-A-Mo&quot; (better known and often covered as &quot;Iko Iko&quot;), based on their taunting chants. Violence began to decline from the 1950s, and by the 1960s, &quot;Chief of Chiefs&quot; Allison Montana worked to end regular violence between the Mardi Gras Indian tribes. He said, &quot;I was going to make them stop fighting with the gun and the knife and start fighting with the needle and thread.&quot; Today, the Mardi Gras Indians settle their fights through the &quot;prettiness&quot; of their suits instead of violence.

==Racism==

The cultural performances of Mardi Gras Indians are rooted in the history of racial discrimination in New Orleans. Free and enslaved Black people were banned from attending Mardi Gras by white New Orleans carnival krewes. Instead, African American communities celebrated Mardi Gras by incorporating West African rhythms, drumming, dance, and masking traditions into their own festivities, and masked as Indians to tell stories of enslaved people escaping slavery and finding refuge in Native American communities. Masking allowed Black Americans to celebrate their African heritage under a more acceptable guise as &quot;Indians&quot;, while showing solidarity with, and paying tribute to, Native American ancestors and allies.

Mardi Gras Indians have continued to experience marginalization and police brutality into the 21st century. In response, the Mardi Gras Indian Council formed in 1985 to facilitate better coordination between the 32 tribes and their members.

===Cultural appropriation===

Indigenous motifs have been employed in carnivals in New Orleans since the 18th century. Such motifs also appear in the suits and regalia of Mardi Gras Indians, although most of the costumes and music used derive from Caribbean traditions, with older West and Central African roots. Some scholars and campaigners have suggested that the use of Native American motifs in Mardi Gras Indian tradition is a form of cultural appropriation. There has also been debate about the use of &quot;war paint&quot; and feathered headdresses, and whether these are based on negative stereotypes of Indigenous people or Afro-Caribbean traditions brought by Haitian and Dominican slaves. 

Scholars Shane Lief and John McCusker suggest the Native American motifs used by Mardi Gras Indians were influenced by the minstrel shows and wild west shows of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which portrayed Black and Native people in negative ways. Most scholars agree that Mardi Gras Indian traditions subvert the racial stereotypes used by white New Orleanians in the 18th and 19th centuries. Folklorist Michael P. Smith and historian Ann Dupont suggest early Black maskers &quot;rekindled&quot; their solidarity with Native Americans in part as a response to seeing racist caricatures of Native Americans and Black people. Smith also says that Mardi Gras Indians had masked as Indigenous people before this. Scholars such as Maurice Martinez, Jeroen Dewulf, and Kalamu ya Salaam also say that these Black masking traditions predate popular Eurocentric interpretations of Native Americans; in parts of the Caribbean and South America, Black people &quot;masked&quot; as Indigenous people because of a shared history of oppression. They suggest that ultimately Caribbean cultures influenced the Mardi Gras Indian tradition.

The activist Adrienne Keene (Cherokee Nation) says she is unsure if the Mardi Gras Indian tradition is cultural appropriation, but that it makes many Native Americans uncomfortable. She says, &quot;The history of Mardi Gras Indians comes out of a history of shared oppression and marginality between the Black and Native residents&quot;, and says the tradition may have evolved &quot;outside of the realm of cultural appropriation into a distinct culture and community&quot;. Donald Harrison Jr., a member of the Congo Nation group, has said that his group changed their name because &quot;some Native Americans may be angry about it&quot;, choosing an African name because they are &quot;an African-American tribe of New Orleans.&quot; 

Demond Melancon, a member of the Young Seminole Hunters, suggests the name of this cultural tradition should change: &quot;It&#x27;s been a hidden culture for 250 years and you have to know where it really comes from.&quot; He says that because the masking tradition originated in Africa, the subculture should be called &quot;Black Maskers&quot;. Author Michael P. Smith suggests calling them the &quot;Maroons of Urban New Orleans&quot;. Some Mardi Gras Indians have also decided to drop the words &quot;Indian Red&quot; from the song of the same name to avoid offending Indigenous people. The song &quot;Indian Red&quot; has been called a &quot;prayer&quot; for the tradition, and has been used since at least the 1940s. 

David Guss suggests that when Black Americans &quot;mask&quot; as Indigenous peoples they are not trying to be Native American; they are telling a visual story of how enslaved Africans escaped slavery in Louisiana and found refuge in nearby Native American villages. He says Black people are not ridiculing or parodying Native Americans. Guss describes the Mardi Gras Indians, Andean natives that dress as European colonists, and other examples of one ethnicity dressing or masking as another ethnicity as practising &quot;ethnic cross-dressing&quot;. Scholar Nikesha Elise Williams provides two reason why Black Americans mask as Indigenous people:

New Orleans filmmaker Jonathan Isaac Jackson says the Mardi Gras Indians have their own unique tradition, which emerged from syncretism of West African and Native American traditions, but suggests that white people and outsiders have begun using Mardi Gras Indian practices without these traditional connections to the culture. He says:

Mardi Gras Indians have worked with lawyers to copyright their creations and prevent people from profiting off their designs.

<text>The Dornier Do 12 &quot;Libelle&quot; III (&quot;Dragonfly III&quot;) was the third of a line of small German flying boats of the 1930s. It started with the Dornier A Libelle I and the Dornier A Libelle II, though the Do 12 was not a continuation, but an entirely new aircraft.

The aircraft was amphibious and would carry three to four passengers. It was powered by a single Argus As 10 engine initially, then a Gnome-Rhône 5Ke Titan engine, mounted above the wing. It first flew in 1932 and went on to be used by the DFS to tow gliders.

==Design==
The Do 12 was a high-wing monoplane, of usual Dornier all-metal construction, with a two-spar, trapezoidal wing, whose trailing edge was very strongly rounded at the root. The fuselage was of rectangular cross-section.

A storage area was in the nose, where equipment, including anchors, could be kept. Behind it, the open cockpit had two side-by-side seats, with optional dual controls. In the cabin, there were two more seats and a storage area, which could also be fitted with bunks for sleeping. Between the cockpit and cabin were nacelles which accommodated the retracted undercarriage wheels, a first for Dornier, which were lowered or raised manually by a crank. The engine sat on a stand high above the wing, alongside two fuel tanks, in pusher configuration.

From the first flight on 23 June 1932, and in the further course of testing, it was obvious that the Argus engine was underpowered, making takeoff distances substantially too long. However, financial difficulties in the company meant that fitting the stronger Gnome-Rhône Titan 5Ke took some time.

Father Paul Schulte, a missionary known as the &quot;Flying Priest&quot;, used the Do 12 &quot;D-INEZ&quot; for many years and in his various books it plays an important role.

<doc id="468383" wikidata="Q186234" url="?curid=468383" title="Kufa">
<text>Kufa ( ), also spelled Kufah, is a city in Iraq, about south of Baghdad, and northeast of Najaf. It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River. The estimated population in 2003 was 110,000.

Along with Samarra, Karbala, Kadhimiya and Najaf, Kufa is one of five Iraqi cities that are of great importance to Shi&#x27;ite Muslims. The city was founded in 638 CE (17 Hijrah) during the reign of the second Rashidun Caliph, Umar ibn Al-Khattab, and it was the final capital of the last Rashidun Caliph, Ali ibn Abi Talib. Kufa was also the founding capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. During the Islamic Golden Age it was home to the grammarians of Kufa. Kufic script is named for the city.

==History==
===Establishment during Umar&#x27;s era===
After the Arabian hegemony and the fall of Persian Empire, and its geographic proximity to the imperial capital, Ctesiphon) at Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah in 636, Kufa was founded and given its name in 637–638 CE, about the same time as Basra. Kufa and Basra were the two &quot;amsar&quot; (garrison cities) of Iraq, serving as military bases and administrative centers. The Companion of the Prophet Saʻd ibn Abī Waqqas founded it as an encampment adjacent to the Lakhmid Arab city of Al-Hirah, and incorporated it as a city of seven divisions. Non-Arabs knew the city under alternate names: &quot;Hīrah&quot; and &quot;Aqulah&quot;, before the consolidations of ʻAbdu l-Mālik in 691. Umar, who assigned the land of the Jews in Arabia to his warriors, ordered the relocation of the Jews of Khaybar to a strip of land in Kufa, in 640. In the 640s, the Kufan commons were agitated that Umar&#x27;s governor was distributing the spoils of war unfairly. In 642 ʻUmar summoned Saʻd to Medina with his accusers. Despite finding Sa&#x27;d to be innocent, Umar deposed him to avert ill feelings. At first, Umar appointed Ammar ibn Yasir and secondly Basra&#x27;s first Governor Abū Mūsā al-Ashʻarī; but the Kufan instigators accepted neither. ʻUmar and the Kufans finally agreed on Al-Mughīrah ibn Shuʻbah.

The city was built in a circular plan according to the Partho-Sasanian architecture.

===Uthman&#x27;s era===

====Governorship of Al-Walid====
Following Umar&#x27;s death (644), his successor Uthman replaced Mughirah with Al-Walid ibn Uqba in 645. This happened while the Arabs were continuing their conquest of western Persia under Uthman ibn Abi al-As from Tawwaj, but late in the 640s, these forces suffered setbacks.

====Setbacks and governorship of Abu Musa====
Uthman in 650 reorganised the Iranian frontier; both Basra and Kufa received new governors (Sa&#x27;id ibn al-&#x27;As in Kufa&#x27;s case), and the east came under Basra&#x27;s command while north of that remained under Kufa&#x27;s. The few but noticeable trouble makers in Kufa sought in 654 and had Sa&#x27;id deposed and instead showed satisfaction with the return of Abu Musa, which Uthman approved seeking to please all. Kufa remained a source of instigations albeit from a minority. In 656 when the Egyptian instigators, in co-operation with those in Kufa, marched onto the Caliph Uthman in Medina, Abu Musa counselled the instigators to no avail.

===Ali&#x27;s era===
Upon Uthman&#x27;s assassination by rebels, governor Abu Musa attempted to restore a non-violent atmosphere in Kufa. The Muslims in Medina and elsewhere supported the right of Ali ibn Abu Talib to the caliphate. In order to manage the military frontiers more efficiently, Ali shifted the capital from Medina to Kufa.

The people of Syria and their governor, Muawiyah, who seized the Caliphate for himself and his family by using the confusion caused by the assassination of Caliph Uthman and being disturbed by the brutal assassination of the Caliph Uthman, demanded retribution. As Muawiyah mounted his campaign to hold Ali responsible for the murder of Uthman, factions developed. In an already emotionally charged atmosphere, Muawiyah&#x27;s refusal to give allegiance to Ali as the Caliph without Ali avenging Uthman first eventually, led to war.

While praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Kharijite Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam&#x27;s poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer.

===Umayyad era===

====Governorship of Ziyad====
Muawiyah I appointed Ziyad ibn Abihi Al the Governor of Kufa, after Hasan&#x27;s A.S migration to Medina, which was a peace treaty which dictated he abdicate his right to caliphate to avoid an open war among Muslims. Some of Hasan&#x27;s A.S followers, like Hujr ibn Adi, were unhappy with the peace treaty, and did not change their ways according to the edicts of the new Governor. This became increasingly noticeable, since it created a rebellion against the ruler. However, Ziyad ibn Abihi was an equally keen strategist and politician, and was able to put down all challenges posed by the rebels against his rule.

===Revolts===
Throughout the Umayyad era, as was the case since the inception of the city by Umar ibn Khattab, there were those among Kufa&#x27;s inhabitants who were rebellious to their rulers. Yazid I was declared as the Second Umayyad Caliph which led to a rebellion among Kufans and they turned to Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Husayn for help and leadership. Yazid appointed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad as the new Governor to put down the rebellion, and kill Husayn if he did not acknowledge his Caliphate, culminating in the Battle of Karbala. There was a period of relative calm during the short reign of Al-Mukhtar&#x27;s rulership, and the Umayyad-era Governorship of Al-Hajjaj.

===Abbasid era===

In 749, the Abbasids under al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba took Kufa and made it their capital. In 762, they moved their seat to Baghdad. Under the Umayyad and early Abbasid decades, Kufa&#x27;s importance gradually shifted from caliphal politics to Islamic theory and practice. The city was sacked by the Qarmatians in 905, 924, and 927, and it never fully recovered from the destruction.

====Kufa in Islamic theology and scholarship====
Wael Hallaq notes that by contrast with Medina and to a lesser extent Syria, in Iraq there was no unbroken Muslim or Ishmaelite population dating back to the prophet Muhammad&#x27;s time. Therefore, Maliki (and Awza&#x27;i) appeals to the practice &quot;amal&quot; () of the community could not apply. Instead the people of Iraq relied upon those Companions of Muhammad who settled there, and upon such factions from the Hijaz whom they respected most. A primary founder of a Sunni school of thought, Abu Hanifa, was a Kufan who had supported the Zaydi Revolt in the 730s; and his jurisprudence was systematised and defended against non-Iraqi rivals (starting with Malikism) by other Kufans, such as al-Shaybani.

Shirazi&#x27;s &quot;Tabaqat&quot;, which Hallaq labels &quot;an important early biographical work dedicated to jurists&quot;, covered 84 &quot;towering figures&quot; of Islamic jurisprudence; to which Kufa provided 20. It was therefore a center surpassed only by Medina (22), although Basra came close (17). Kufans could claim that the more prominent of Muhammad&#x27;s Companions had called that city home: not only Ibn Abu Waqqas, Abu Musa, and Ali; but also Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud, Salman the Persian, Ammar ibn Yasir, and Huzayfa ibn Yaman. Among its jurists prior to Abu Hanifa, Hallaq singles out Sa&#x27;id ibn Jubayr, Ibrahim al-Nakha‘i, and Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman; and considers Amir al-Sha‘bi a pioneer in the science of judicial precedent.

During the 8th century, Kufa was home to scholars such as Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Sufyan al-Thawri

The Shia theology started in the city of Kufa. Many preachers claimed to be students of the Medina based Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and his son Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, although Sunni scholars question the truthfulness of these preachers. Originally it was divided into various sects, some of which lent support to the rebellions of Zayd ibn Ali and Abbasids.

Kufa was also among the first centers of Qur&#x27;anic interpretation, which Kufans credited to the exegete Mujahid (until he escaped to Mecca in 702). It further recorded general traditions as Hadith; in the 9th century, Yahya ibn ‘Abd al-Hamid al-Himmani compiled many of these into a Musnad.

Given Kufa&#x27;s opposition to Damascus, Kufan traditionists had their own take on Umayyad history. The Shia historian Abu Mikhnaf al-Azdi (d. 774) compiled their accounts into a rival history, which became popular under Abbasid rule. This history does not survive but later historians like Tabari quoted from it extensively.

Kufa is also where the kufic script was developed, the earliest script of the Arabic language. As the scholar al-Qalqashandi maintained, &quot;The Arabic script [&quot;khatt&quot;] is the one which is now known as Kufic. From it evolved all the present hands.&quot; The angular script which later came to be known as Kufic had its origin about a century earlier than the founding of the town of Kufa, according to Moritz in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;. The kufic script was derived from one of the four pre-Islamic Arabic scripts, the one called &quot;al-Hiri&quot; (used in Hirah). (The other three were &quot;al-Anbari&quot; (from Anbar), &quot;al-Makki&quot; (from Mecca) and &quot;al-Madani&quot; (from Medina)). Ibn al-Nadim (died ) the author of the famous &quot;Kitab al-Fihrist&quot;, an index of Arabic books, dedicates the a section of the first chapter to calligraphy.

===Post-Abbasid history===

Kufan coins were among the numerous silver coins of various origins found in 1989 by the mouth of Dvina, right next to Arkhangelsk in the extreme north of Russia. The Kufan coins were the only non-European ones in the hoard, and testify to the very wide-ranging indirect trading links which Kufa had at one time. It is estimated the hoard was buried in the beginning of the 12th century, when Kufa was already long past the peak of its fortunes, but the coins might have arrived at the far north at a much earlier time.

Kufa began to come under constant attack in the 11th century and eventually shrank and lost its importance. Over the last century, the population of Kufa began to grow again. It continues to be an important pilgrimage site for Shi&#x27;ite Muslims.

==Geography==
Kufa is located on the banks of the Euphrates River. It is south of Baghdad, and northeast of Najaf.

==Religious significance==
The town has produced several Shi&#x27;ite Muslim scholars. It also contains several sites of importance to Shi&#x27;ites:

On July 3, 1965, the new Fort Wayne Children&#x27;s Zoo opened on with 18 animal exhibits. Earl Wells was the original Zoo Director. In 1976, a major expansion of the zoo was the African Veldt attraction, where savanna animals grazed in open fields east of the Central Zoo. In 1987, the Australian Adventure premiered, showcasing animals from the Outback. A domed Indonesian Rain Forest exhibit opened in 1994, with Orangutan Valley opening a year later, and Tiger Forest in 1996.

On October 19, 2004, five wildebeests broke through a gate and jumped a fence, roaming the streets of a nearby neighborhood. Eventually, the wildebeests were captured, though two of them suffered broken legs and were forced to be euthanized. The zoo was fined $825 for the incident.

On November 2, 2007, artificial rocks made of Styrofoam caught fire in the zoo&#x27;s new African Journey expansion, the largest project in the zoo&#x27;s 42-year history. The fire happened where workers were constructing an African lion exhibit, the centerpiece of the new expansion. Thick black plumes of smoke billowing from the site of the fire were clearly visible across the skies of Fort Wayne and much of the region. No workers or animals were harmed in the blaze.

On July 1, 2015, the zoo celebrated its 50th anniversary with about 400 guests. The 47th Three Rivers Festival parade honored the occasion, with the theme &quot;Here&#x27;s to Zoo&quot;.

On March 3, 2020, the zoo announced that longtime Executive Director Jim Anderson would retire at the end of the 2020 season. Anderson has served as the Zoo’s executive director since 1994, when he succeeded its founding executive director, Earl Wells. On September 1, 2020, The Board of Directors announced Rick Schuiteman from SeaWorld San Diego would replace Anderson as only the third Executive Director.

On February 4, 2021, the zoo announced two of its Sumatran tigers tested positive for COVID-19. Both cats were showing mild signs of a dry cough, triggering animal care experts to take notice. Fecal samples for both tigers, Bugara and Indah, were collected for testing and performed in veterinary laboratories. The tigers recovered without incident.

On March 15, 2022, the zoo announced their support of Ukrainian Zoos, during the Russian War, by contributing $5,000 from their Conservation Fund to go directly to the EAZA to support Zoo animals and keeper staff.

On April 21, 2023, the zoo announced the Indonesian Rainforest area would be reimagined and renamed to Asian Trek allowing the zoo to add new species to the space and expand the footprint to include Bamboo Forest and Red Panda Ridge.

On December 10, 2024, Zoo Director Schuiteman announced it would no longer be called the Fort Wayne Children&#x27;s Zoo, but instead, the Fort Wayne Zoo beginning January 1, 2025.

==Exhibits==
The zoo consists of several self-contained biomes themed as different regions of the world.

The African Journey opened to the public June 6, 2009, on the former site of the African Veldt. The $9 million African Journey is currently the largest expansion in the FWCZ&#x27;s history, featuring an African lion exhibit, African Village, interactive cultural center, reticulated giraffe feeding area, Safari Trail, plains zebras and wildebeest, new animal exhibits: (banded mongooses, Rüppell&#x27;s griffon vultures, the Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik and spotted hyenas, honey badgers, bat-eared foxes, great white pelicans, and servals), Amur leopards and a group educational and picnic area. The Sky Safari, a ski lift-like ride, gives riders an aerial view of the Serengeti-based landscape.

The former Australian Adventure area opened with Australia After Dark exhibit, featuring nocturnal animals native to Australia such as bats, short-beaked echidnas, and owls. A separate building held a 20,000-gallon aquarium containing the Sharks, Rays, and Jellyfish Exhibit, as well as a model coral reef with tropical fish. In the Kangaroo Walkabout, a roped path lead through an open area of eastern grey kangaroos, which may cross the path at their leisure. The dingo exhibit held a mating pair and produced and housed a new litter of dingo pups in 2012. An aviary featured birds native to Australia. There were other assorted exhibits, and a Dugout Canoe Ride where you could view the Australian Adventure from a canal.

The new Australian Adventure is roughly the same, except a stingray exhibit replacing Australia After Dark and a new Aquarium (both accessed by a new plaza), and several other new buildings, including a new exhibit for Tasmanian devils. The Stingray Exhibit also offers daily feeding where guests can feed them for a nominal charge.

The Central Zoo includes assorted animals from the Americas and a few from other regions, including Canada lynxes, ring-tailed lemurs, African penguins, North American river otters, Aldabra tortoises, American alligators and macaws and a two toed sloth. Sea Lion Beach is a major attraction with California sea lions. Sea Lion Beach has a scheduled feeding performances occur periodically throughout the day. Monkey Island contains a family of Panamanian white-faced capuchins. Indian peafowl roam freely throughout the farm. Also located in the Central Zoo is a duck pond.

The Indiana Family Farm expands from the old petting zoo area, which contained only goats, wild turkeys, ravens, chickens, and white-tailed deer. Now a model barn and farmhouse, as well as signs from the point of view of children living on a farm, lend atmosphere. Horses, sheep, rabbits, calves, and others are all contained in open stalls and may be petted by visitors. Barn mice and other small animals can be viewed. Goats reside in an open paddock which visitors can enter, and, for a price, feed the goats pellets from ice cream cones and milk from bottles, or brush them for free. This area is considered part of the Central Zoo and is located directly before the exit. The Wild Things Gift Shop at the exit was recently expanded.

The Asian Trek, formerly known as the Indonesian Rainforest, features Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran tigers, Komodo dragons, reticulated pythons, clouded leopards, red pandas, assorted birds, mammals, and primates, as well as a domed area (Domeaviary) containing birds, fish, reptiles, and, until recently, butterflies. The domeaviary allows visitors to experience the sights, sounds, and feel of a rain forest. This area also has an Endangered Species Carousel.

A Baby Story

Early in the morning of Saturday, November 22, 2014, Tara, a 19-year-old Sumatran orangutan, whose pregnancy was announced in October 2014 (orangutans are critically endangered), gave birth to a healthy female baby. The baby&#x27;s father is a 28-year-old male named Tengku. Tengku arrived in Fort Wayne in 1995, from Zoo Atlanta, and Tara arrived in 2013 from the Columbus Zoo; orangutan gestation is normally 245 days. Though Tara had never given birth before and had never observed other females of her species caring for their offspring, Fort Wayne officials, having observed her after the birth, are cautiously optimistic, having prepared for these potential obstacles when, after agreeing to try and breed them on the recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27; Orangutan Species Survival Plan program, they formulated a detailed Birth Management Plan.

The baby orangutan, named Asmara, who was born on November 22, 2014, has made Orangutan Valley a popular destination in the zoo, as guests can frequently spot her and her mother Tara in the enclosure. The other adult male orangutan in this facility is named Owen who is a hybrid orangutan and not under any breeding recommendations, thus he is spayed. He also serves a role as a father figure to Asmara.

<doc id="468413" wikidata="Q1273477" url="?curid=468413" title="Clay Shaw (politician)">
<text>Eugene Clay Shaw Jr. (April 19, 1939 – September 10, 2013) was an American jurist and Republican politician who served as mayor of Fort Lauderdale and represented South Florida in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 until 2007. He was defeated for re-election by Ron Klein in 2006.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Shaw was born in Miami, Florida. He graduated in 1957 from Miami Edison Senior High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business in 1961 from Stetson University in Florida, where he joined Sigma Nu fraternity, a master&#x27;s degree in accounting in 1963 from the University of Alabama, and a law degree in 1966 from Stetson University School of Law. Shaw married the former Emilie Costar on August 22, 1960.

After graduating, Shaw practiced law and worked as a certified public accountant. In 1968, he became assistant city attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was chief city prosecutor from 1968 to 1969 and an associate municipal judge from 1969 to 1971.

==Fort Lauderdale politics==
Shaw was the city commissioner from 1971 to 1973 and vice mayor 1973 to 1975. He then served as mayor of Fort Lauderdale from 1975 to 1981. During his tenure as mayor, Shaw served on the advisory board and executive committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, was president of the National Conference of Republican Mayors, and was named special U.S. ambassador to Papua New Guinea by President Gerald Ford.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;1980
The 1980 election cycle provided Republicans with the opportunity to gain Congressional seats. As Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter battled for the White House, the National Republican Campaign Committee was actively seeking a Republican candidate in South Florida to challenge freshman Democratic congressman Edward J. Stack. The district, one of the first parts of Florida to turn Republican, had been held by Republican J. Herbert Burke for 12 years before Stack ousted him in 1978. Having been turned down by two potential candidates, including state Senator Van B. Poole, National Congressional Republicans set their eyes on popular Fort Lauderdale mayor, Clay Shaw.

After multiple attempts to convince Shaw to run for Congress, Shaw agreed. With the support of his wife, Emilie, and four young children, he undertook the task of defeating an incumbent. However, Shaw&#x27;s candidacy received a significant boost when Stack was upset in the Democratic primary by a young Fort Lauderdale lawyer, Allen Becker. Shaw and Becker faced off in a spirited November general election with Shaw winning 55 percent of the vote. Congressman-elect Shaw was on his way to Washington to represent Broward County&#x27;s 15th Congressional district.
Also in 1980, Ronald Reagan became the 40th president of the United States, and Republicans gained control of the United States Senate.

;1982
Redistricting numbered Shaw&#x27;s district as the 15th District. Shaw faced a rematch against his predecessor, Ed Stack. However, Shaw turned back this challenge fairly easily, winning 57 percent of the vote.

;1984
Shaw won re-election with 66% against Democratic nominee Bill Humphrey.

;1986
Shaw won re-election without opposition.

;1988
Shaw won re-election with 66% against Democratic nominee Mike Kuhle.

;1990
Shaw was re-elected without opposition.

;1992
In November 1992, Shaw faced his toughest congressional opponent to date. Following the 1990 U.S. census, the Democratic-controlled Florida Legislature reapportioned the state&#x27;s congressional districts. Shaw&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 22nd District and significantly altered.

For his first five terms, he had represented a relatively compact district in Broward County. However, it was reconfigured into a district that stretched for 90 miles along the coast, from Juno Beach to the north to Lincoln Road on Miami Beach to the south. His Democratic opponent was State Senate President Gwen Margolis, who had drawn her home in Dade County into the district.

The Shaw–Margolis race was highly competitive. Both campaigns were full of energy and raised thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. The campaigns highlighted the other candidates&#x27; records. She claimed that Shaw voted to &quot;decriminalize drugs&quot; while in Washington. Shaw called the claim &quot;an absolute falsehood&quot;. She fought back concerns about her involvement with the failed Miami Beach Savings &amp; Loan. In March 1992, the Resolute Trust Corporation filed suit against Margolis and other bank directors claiming they approved speculative loans and were responsible for $4.5 million in losses. In the end, however, Shaw cruised to victory in November, claiming 58% of the general election vote.

;1994
Shaw won re-election with 63% of the vote against Democratic nominee Hermine Weiner.

Shaw was a supporter of the Republican Contract with America that helped sweep the Republican Party to control of the United States Congress for the first time in forty years.

;1996
Shaw won re-election with 62% of the vote against Democratic nominee Ken Cooper.

;1998
Shaw was re-elected unopposed.

;2000

Seeking his 10th term in Congress, Shaw faced a challenge in state Representative Elaine Bloom. Bloom declared her candidacy in June 1999. Aided by the Democratic presidential ticket of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, Bloom was making the race competitive.

In early October it was reported that Bloom served on the board of a Florida pharmaceutical company that was accused of price fixing. Bloom denied the accusations, yet press reports, including a piece on &quot;Nightline&quot;, highlighted the price fixing scandal. Bloom remained on defense for the remainder of the campaign. Ultimately, Shaw won by 599 votes out of more than 220,000 votes cast. It was only the second difficult re-election contest for Shaw. The district, once a Republican-leaning swing district, swung Democratic in the early 1990s along with much of South Florida. In 2000, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush in the district by 52% to 48%.

;2002
Following Shaw&#x27;s extremely close race in 2000, the state legislature, now controlled by Republicans, cut out the heavily Democratic spur of Miami-Dade County that had been added in the 1990s round of redistricting, pushing it further into Palm Beach County. Although the district was friendlier for Shaw than its predecessor, it was only slightly less Democratic than its predecessor (even though Republicans had a small plurality of registered voters). Shaw was re-elected with 61% of the vote against Democrat Carol Roberts, a former Palm Beach County commissioner.

;2004
Shaw won re-election with 63% of the vote against a last-minute replacement Democratic candidate, Robin Rorapaugh. His original opponent, Jim Stork, dropped out before the election for medical reasons, but his name remained on the ballot. John Kerry defeated George W. Bush in the district by a margin of 50% to 48%.

;2006

Shaw was defeated in the general election by Democratic State Senator Ron Klein, who won by a 51% to 48% margin.

After his 2006 loss, Shaw donated his official Congressional papers (totaling more than 100 linear feet) and memorabilia to his alma mater, Stetson University. The Shaw Collection includes policy notebooks, plaques, awards, videos, letters from U.S. presidents, a number of signed and framed bills with the presidential signing pens, and more than 2,500 photos.

===Tenure===
;E. Clay Shaw Jr. 17th Street Causeway Bridge
In 2002, the newly constructed 17th Street Causeway bridge reopened to Fort Lauderdale traffic. As a result of federal funding secured by the Congressman Shaw, the Florida Legislature approved a resolution naming the 17th Street bridge the E. Clay Shaw Jr. Bridge.

;Missing Children&#x27;s Act
Swept into office as part of the Reagan Revolution, Shaw quickly found himself at the center of a national tragedy following the death of 7-year-old constituent Adam Walsh. As a result of this tragedy, Shaw introduced the Missing Children&#x27;s Act of 1982. The legislation allowed parents access to a central computer file designed to trace missing children. President Reagan signed the legislation on October 12, 1982.

Shaw was honored for his efforts and continued support for missing and exploited children in 2004, with other members of Congress, by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and its founder John Walsh.

;Posse Comitatus 
As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Shaw aggressively supported legislation to fight the war on drugs. In fall 1986, Shaw lamented that illegal drugs were &quot;the biggest threat we have ever had to our national security.&quot;

To combat the rise of illegal drug trafficking and its impact on Americans, in May 1988 the House of Representatives voted 385 to 23 authorizing 45 days for President Reagan to mobilize U.S. armed forces in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. The legislation required the U.S. military to halt illegal drug trafficking into the southern portions of the United States while requiring the Pentagon to begin aerial radar coverage of the U.S. southern border. The legislation amended the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act which prohibited the military from enforcing civilian laws. Calling the overwhelming bipartisan vote the end of a defeatist &quot;Vietnam type mentality toward the war on drugs&quot;, Shaw solidified his standing as a leader in the war on drugs.

;Welfare reform
Shaw said in 1994, &quot;The inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty was written before welfare. People come to this country to work. Now the question becomes, Are these handouts a magnet that is bringing people into this country? To some degree, they are.&quot;

As a result of the Republican takeover of the United States Congress following the 1994 mid-term elections, Shaw was awarded with his first chairmanship of his Congressional career. As a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, Shaw was tapped to chair the Human Resources Subcommittee. This move was significant, for included in the Republican Contract with America was a commitment to reform of the nation&#x27;s welfare system.

Shaw began work on reforming welfare in 1995 by holding numerous committee hearings and public sessions to identify problems within the welfare system. Working with state governors such as Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, Michigan Governor John Engler, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and Delaware Governor Tom Carper, Shaw began crafting legislation that shifted the federal focus of social welfare to an emphasis on personal responsibility. After two presidential vetoes by President Bill Clinton, welfare reform was finally signed into law on August 22, 1996.

===Committee assignments===
;House Ways and Means Committee
Shaw was the second most senior Republican on the House Ways and Means committee at the time he left Congress, having assumed that position after Phil Crane lost in his bid for re-election.

;Trade subcommittee
From 2005 to 2007, Shaw chaired the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee and was actively involved in the passage of the United States free trade agreement between a number of Central American nations and the Dominican Republic. As chairman, Shaw and his fellow Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee voted the trade agreement out of committee on a straight party line vote.

Shortly thereafter the House passed, by a vote of 217–215, the Dominican Republic Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) to open U.S. exports up, duty-free, to the Central American nations of the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. President George W. Bush signed the United States-DR-CAFTA Free Trade Agreement on August 3, 2005, with Shaw and other members of Congress present.

In addition, Shaw was a strong supporter of U.S. export opportunities to the impoverished nation of Haiti.

;Social Security Subcommittee
From 1999 to 2005, he was a chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee. As chairman of the Social Security committee, Shaw introduced legislation to repeal the Social Security Earnings Penalty. In March 2000, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 422–0 passed the Social Security Earnings Penalty repeal. Following Senate approval, President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law. The new law allows seniors ages 65 to 69 to continue working without the fear of losing their Social Security benefits.

;Human Resources Subcommittee
From 1995 to 1998, Shaw chaired the Human Resources subcommittee. Following the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Shaw was named as chair of this important House committee. Having introduced legislation previously to reform welfare, he found himself in a key post to enact much-needed reform. As a result of his efforts, the welfare system was drastically changed and replaced with an emphasis on personal responsibility. Welfare reform was the hallmark of Shaw&#x27;s congressional career.

;Florida Congressional Delegation chairman
Shaw was also the chairman of the Florida delegation from 1996 until leaving office in 2007. In this capacity, Shaw coordinated activities by the delegation including bipartisan delegation meetings. In this capacity, he facilitated discussion amongst Florida colleagues on particular issues or topics and invited special guests to address the delegation including Governor Jeb Bush, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison, and federal and state officials.

;House 2015 caucus
In 2003, following lung cancer surgery, Shaw, along with Minnesota Congressman Colin Peterson, founded the House 2015 Caucus. The purpose of the 2015 Caucus was to find a cure for cancer or treat it as a manageable disease by 2015. Members of the caucus expressed their desire to eliminate cancer disease and suffering by 2015.

Shaw was also a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, Congressional Fire Services Caucus, Congressional Narcotics Abuse and Control Caucus, Congressional Social Security Caucus, Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, Friends of Ireland, Law Enforcement Caucus and Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. He was also the co-chair of the Congressional Boating Caucus, Congressional Coastal Caucus and International Conservation Caucus.

==Post-congressional career==
In 2007, following his departure from Congress, Shaw provided his entire Congressional collection to his alma mater, Stetson University. The Shaw collection is housed at the university&#x27;s duPont-Ball library in DeLand, Florida.

In 2008, Clay Shaw was named a Great Floridian by the Florida Department of State, an honor extended to individuals who made major contributions to the progress and welfare of the state of Florida. Shaw&#x27;s honor was advocated by state House Representative Adam Hasner (R-Delray Beach). Clay Shaw remained active in the Ft. Lauderdale community, including chairing the recent celebration of Ft. Lauderdale&#x27;s founding.

== Personal life ==
Shaw and his wife Emilie had four children Emilie &quot;Mimi&quot; Carter, Jennifer Wilder, E. Clay Shaw III and J.C. Shaw and 15 grandchildren Charles Wyatt Carter, Emilie Martin, Rita Carter, Casey Carter, Keeley Iriondo, Ashton Brown, Hogan Wilder, Chandler Wilder, Reagan Shaw, E. Clay Shaw IV, David Baker Shaw, Hampton Shaw, Dakota Shaw, McGregor Shaw and Keegan Shaw. .

Shaw died September 10, 2013, after a battle with lung cancer. He was 74. He is buried in Cuba, Alabama.

<doc id="468415" wikidata="Q7419798" url="?curid=468415" title="Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy">
<text>The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is an agency of the state of California in the United States founded in 1980 and dedicated to the acquisition of land for preservation as open space, for wildlife and California native plants habitat Nature Preserves, and for public recreation activities.

The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy was established by the California State Legislature in 1980. Since that time, it has helped to preserve over 72,000 acres of parkland in both wilderness and urban settings, and improved more than 114 public recreational facilities throughout Southern California. Additionally, it has given grants to nonprofit organizations for educational and interpretation programs that have served hundreds of thousands of children and other park visitors.

==Territory protected==
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy territory originally was within the Santa Susana Mountains and Santa Monica Mountains, and the Simi Hills; areas located north and west of metropolitan Los Angeles in Ventura County and Los Angeles County. Since then its territory has been extended to the east to include parks in the San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills, and Puente Hills.

The 450,000-acre (180,000 ha) &quot;zone&quot; in which the conservancy can acquire land is bounded on the south by the Pacific Coast Highway from Santa Monica to Point Mugu. The zone extends inland roughly 50 miles (80 km) from Malibu north to Newhall Pass and 65 miles (105 km) from Thousand Oaks east to Pasadena. Several major freeways in Los Angeles cross the zone, including the Hollywood, Ventura, San Diego and Interstate 5.

==Preservation process==
Since its founding, the Conservancy has acquired over 155,000 acres (63,000 ha) and identified another 15,000 acres (6,100 ha) within its zone as crucial for preservation. In addition to buying land outright, the Conservancy operates through public-private partnerships to promote low-density use among private land-owners. The conservancy also acquires rights to land through &quot;time-leasing&quot;, receives land through donations and acquisition of foreclosures, and as mitigation for development projects.

The Conservancy zone includes the 155,000-acre (63,000 ha) Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, created by the United States Congress in 1978, as well as 40,000 acres (16,000 ha) of state parks, including Topanga State Park, and parks within Los Angeles&#x27; city limits including the Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park above Tarzana.

==Some examples==
===Additions===
The Conservancy was responsible for the 1990s acquisition of the Jordan Ranch lands in the western Simi Hills near Thousand Oaks from entertainer Bob Hope, creating the Cheeseboro and Palo Commado Canyons Park section of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). The ranch was purchased by a developer and turned over the National Park Service as part of a land development deal, which then allowed their development of new housing and golf courses on the Ahmanson Ranch land adjacent to the east.

Late in 2003, the Conservancy secured state funds to purchase Ahmanson Ranch as well, creating the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, a huge green belt on the western edge of West Hills and Woodland Hills.

The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy also acquired the Peter Strauss Ranch from the entertainer Peter Strauss in the central Santa Monica Mountains, which was also turned over to the National Park Service and opened to the public in the SMMNRA.

The Conservancy is one of the four agencies sharing operation of the Santa Monica Mountains Anthony C. Beilenson Interagency Visitor Center, located at the former King Gillette Ranch stables. It is located at 26876 Mulholland Highway, at the junction with Las Virgenes/Malibu Canyon Road near Calabasas. The stables and Gillette mansion were originally designed by Wallace Neff in the 1920s. The completed redesign project is the first visitor center in a zero-energy building in the National Park Service, and is LEED certified. It is named for Anthony C. Beilenson, the former congressman who authored legislation in 1978 to establish the SMMNRA. The center is operated by the four partner agencies in the park: the National Park Service, California State Parks, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA).

===Subtractions===
As reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, controversy ensued when the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy voted in April 2014 to drop its opposition to the large Dave Evans subdivision development proposal for Malibu, in exchange for $1 million in donations and consulting work. The singer Dave Evans, a.k.a. &quot;The Edge&quot;, with the Irish rock band U2, has proposed a compound of five mansions on a coast−facing Santa Monica Mountains ridge, above Serra Canyon on Sweetwater Mesa Road. Malibu residents and environmentalists have opposed the project as excessive development and viewshed destruction, and have called into question the ethics of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy regarding the proposal. The California Coastal Commission postponed its October 2014 vote on the project until 2015. Joe Edmiston, the conservancy&#x27;s executive director, said his group had been wrong to agree to those terms to drop its opposition. The California Supreme Court rejected the scheme in 2018.

<text>AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC, also known as AT&amp;T Wireless and marketed as simply AT&amp;T, is an American telecommunications company. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T Inc. and provides wireless services in the United States. AT&amp;T Mobility is the third largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 117.9 million subscribers as of December 31, 2024.

The company is headquartered in Brookhaven, Georgia. Originally known as Cingular Wireless (a joint venture between SBC Communications and BellSouth) from 2000 to 2007, the company acquired the old AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004; SBC later acquired the original AT&amp;T and adopted its name. Cingular became wholly owned by AT&amp;T in December 2006 as a result of AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of BellSouth.

In January 2007, Cingular confirmed it would rebrand itself under the AT&amp;T name. Although the legal corporate name change occurred immediately, for both regulatory and brand-awareness reasons both brands were used in the company&#x27;s signage and advertising during a transition period. The transition concluded in late June, just prior to the rollout of the Apple iPhone.

On March 20, 2011, AT&amp;T Mobility announced its intention to acquire T-Mobile US from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. If it had received government and regulatory approval, AT&amp;T would have had more than 130 million subscribers. However, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and AT&amp;T Mobility&#x27;s competitors (such as Sprint Corporation) opposed the move on the grounds that it would substantially reduce competition in the cellular network market. In December 2011, in the face of both governmental and widespread consumer opposition, AT&amp;T withdrew its offer to complete the merger.

==Services==
AT&amp;T currently offers 3 tiers of its Unlimited Your Way plan, AT&amp;T Unlimited Premium® PL, AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra® EL, or AT&amp;T Unlimited Starter® SL. Customers can also choose either the AT&amp;T Value Plus VL or AT&amp;T 4 GB plans. All plans come with unlimited talk and text, with unlimited data on all except the AT&amp;T 4 GB plan. The higher tier plans include premium data that offers superior service, up to the allotted limit on each line during a bill cycle, plus other features like Mobile Hotspot and more. The AT&amp;T Unlimited Premium® PL plan also includes unlimited talk, text, and data in 20 Latin American countries including the Dominican Republic, included at no extra charge. As of January 8, 2016, AT&amp;T no longer offers two-year contracts for subsidized smartphones on consumer accounts. Customers who currently have two-year contracts are grandfathered until they upgrade to a new device, in which case they will have to choose from AT&amp;T&#x27;s NEXT installment plans for smartphones. Unlimited data plans may be throttled based on the terms of the plan.

AT&amp;T also allows existing customers to stay on legacy right plans; however, reserves the right to terminate or require a plan change per its terms of service. 

Within AT&amp;T&#x27;s 21-state landline footprint, other AT&amp;T services are offered at the AT&amp;T retail stores, including signing up for home phone, internet, and U-verse. AT&amp;T stores outside of its footprint offer wireless services. All AT&amp;T company-owned stores nationwide sell DirecTV. AT&amp;T also provides free-email services to its customers. 

==Employees==
A large number of AT&amp;T Mobility employees are unionized, belonging to the Communications Workers of America. The CWA represented roughly 15,000 of the previous 20,000 formerly AT&amp;T Wireless employees as of early 2006. As of the end of 2009, the CWA website claims that roughly 40,000 workers of AT&amp;T Mobility are represented by the union.

==History==

===Cingular Wireless===
Cingular Wireless was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth. The joint venture created the nation&#x27;s second-largest carrier. Cingular grew out of a conglomeration of more than 100 companies, including 12 well-known regional companies with Bell roots. The 12 companies included:
* Three companies spun off from Advanced Mobile Phone Service
** Ameritech Mobile Communications
** BellSouth Mobility
** Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems
* BellSouth Mobility DCS
* BellSouth Wireless Data
* CCPR Services d/b/a Cellular One of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands
* Pacific Bell Wireless
* Pacific Bell Wireless Northwest
* SBC Wireless
* SNET Mobility
* Southwestern Bell Wireless

SBC Wireless had previously operated in several northeast markets under the &quot;Cellular One&quot; brand, while BellSouth&#x27;s wireless operations incorporated the former Houston Cellular.

Cingular&#x27;s lineage can be traced back to Advanced Mobile Phone Service, which was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T created in 1978 to provide cellular service nationwide. AMPS was divided among the Regional Bell Operating Companies as part of the Bell System divestiture.

With the exception of Pacific Bell and BellSouth Mobility DCS, the digital network consisted of D-AMPS technology. The Pacific Bell and BellSouth Mobility DCS networks used GSM technology on the PCS frequency band (1900 MHz).

In October 2007, AT&amp;T&#x27;s president and chief executive officer Stan Sigman announced his retirement. Ralph de la Vega, group president-Regional Telecom &amp; Entertainment, was named as president and CEO of AT&amp;T Mobility.

===AT&amp;T Wireless merger===
In February 2004, after a bidding war with Britain&#x27;s Vodafone Plc (at the time a part-owner of Verizon Wireless), Cingular announced that it would purchase its struggling competitor, AT&amp;T Wireless Services, for $41 billion. This was more than twice the company&#x27;s trading value.
The merger was completed on October 26, 2004. The combined company had a customer base of 46 million people at the time, making Cingular the largest wireless provider in the United States. AT&amp;T Wireless was then legally renamed New Cingular Wireless Services. Shortly after, new commercials were shown with the &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; transforming into the Cingular logo, and with the Cingular logo&#x27;s text turned blue to acknowledge the change. Some of the companies that comprised Cingular, such as BellSouth Mobility, ceased to exist when they were legally merged into the operating company subsidiary AT&amp;T Wireless PCS, which was New Cingular Wireless PCS.

First announced on June 22, 2005, Cingular Wireless announced the intention to divest its Caribbean and Bermuda operations and licenses which it acquired from the acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless, to Irish-owned and Jamaica-based Digicel Group under undisclosed financial terms.

In 2006, one year following the deal, a high-ranking source allegedly close to the sale pointed the Barbados Daily Nation Newspaper towards some SEC filings made by Cingular which were said to establish an idea of the approximate sale price of the deal. According to the SEC filings Cingular was paid around $122 million, with much of that cost going towards the purchase of the former AT&amp;T Wireless assets in Barbados by Digicel.

At the time of the merger, there were two networks: the historic AT&amp;T &quot;Blue&quot; Network and the Cingular &quot;Orange&quot; Network. Both networks contained a mix of both TDMA and GSM facilities. Approximately 50,000 cell sites had to be melded together. From a technical standpoint, the &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; networks were considered different networks until integration was completed in 2005. Enhanced Network Selection (ENS) was used to home cellular devices on either the &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;orange&quot; network during this process.

===The New AT&amp;T===

On November 21, 2005, Ed Whitacre, then CEO of the newly merged SBC/AT&amp;T, announced plans to market Cingular&#x27;s service under the &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; brand. BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher countered that the terms of the joint venture allow either party to sell the service under another name, and that he believes they will be using the brand to market to business customers. Cingular president Stan Sigman concurred with BellSouth&#x27;s position, indicating that the Cingular brand would continue but be sold under the AT&amp;T brand where offered in packages with other AT&amp;T services, such as data and wireline telephony.

However, AT&amp;T announced on March 5, 2006, that it would acquire BellSouth. The acquisition was finalized on December 29, 2006, when the FCC gave its final approval. The following month, AT&amp;T announced that it would phase out the Cingular brand across all of its services and replace it with AT&amp;T, with an accompanying advertising campaign branding the combined company as &quot;The New AT&amp;T.&quot; Commercials featured the orange Cingular &quot;Jack&quot; logo encircling the AT&amp;T globe logo several times, dragging its blue bars behind it to form the globe&#x27;s blue stripes, before finally disappearing behind it, being backed by the chorus of the Oasis song &quot;All Around the World&quot;. AT&amp;T added the color orange to its signage to reflect the change; AT&amp;T would eventually remove orange in 2015 following another rebranding related to its acquisition of DirecTV.

In November 2007, AT&amp;T acquired Dobson Communications, who owned Cellular One and was a roaming partner of AT&amp;T, for $2.8 billion. The sale added 1.7 million subscribers and expanded AT&amp;T coverage in various suburban and rural markets (including Alaska). On November 7, 2008, AT&amp;T announced its intent to acquire Centennial Wireless for $944 million, expanding its coverage in the Midwest, southern U.S., and Puerto Rico.

===Failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA===
On March 20, 2011, AT&amp;T and Deutsche Telekom announced that AT&amp;T had agreed to acquire T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in a deal estimated to be worth $39 billion in cash and stock. AT&amp;T said the deal was expected to close in 12 months and was subject to regulatory approval. As of June 2011, it was being examined by the FCC. On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice formally announced that it had filed a lawsuit to block the merger. On November 22, 2011, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski recommended sending AT&amp;T&#x27;s proposed T-Mobile acquisition to an administrative law judge for review and a hearing. On November 23, 2011, AT&amp;T withdrew its application with the FCC regarding the acquisition of T-Mobile USA. They also indicated that they would recognize a $4 billion dollar accounting charge in the event of a deal collapse. That charge covers a $3 billion cash breakup fee and $1 billion as the market value for the spectrum they were required to transfer to T-Mobile if the deal failed to complete.

===2012–present===
On August 2, 2012, AT&amp;T announced its intent to acquire NextWave Wireless. On January 22, 2013, AT&amp;T announced its intent to acquire the U.S. retail wireless operations of Atlantic Tele-Network, doing business as Alltel, for $780 million. On June 24, 2014, Plateau Wireless announced the sale of assets and operations in eastern New Mexico and west Texas to AT&amp;T, including wireless spectrum and 40,000 customers.

In November 2014 and January 2015, AT&amp;T acquired the Mexican wireless carriers Iusacell and Nextel Mexico to form AT&amp;T Mexico.

On October 9, 2019, Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico&#x27;s parent company (Liberty Latin America), announced the acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless Services in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in a $1.95 billion deal. The sale was completed on November 2, 2020. In May 2021, the company began promoting AT&amp;T and Liberty as a unified brand. In September 2021, Liberty began phasing out the AT&amp;T brand and introduced a new logo.

On February 22, 2024, a massive outage affected customers nationwide.

==Network==

===GSM facilities===

In California, Nevada, Northern New Jersey and New York City, Cingular and T-Mobile USA maintained and shared a GSM-1900 network prior to the acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless, through a joint venture known as &quot;GSM Facilities&quot;. The network sharing agreement allowed Cingular to offer local service in northern New Jersey and New York City and T-Mobile USA to offer service in California and Nevada. On May 25, 2004, Cingular and T-Mobile USA announced their intention to dissolve the agreement contingent on Cingular&#x27;s successful acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless, the Cingular network was transferred to T-Mobile USA, with Cingular continuing work on the GSM facilities at AT&amp;T Wireless sites.

===Fiber network switching facilities===
AT&amp;T has a global sub-sea Tier-1 fiber network switching facility on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in conjunction with University of the Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park.

===Coverage===

As a result of its formation through mergers and acquisitions, as well as the rapid technological change in the wireless industry, AT&amp;T operates the second-largest digital voice and data network within its United States footprint. AT&amp;T&#x27;s network footprint supports 4G and uses LTE/LTE-Advanced for simultaneous packet switched voice and data communications. AT&amp;T is also in the process of rolling out its 5G network based on the NR specification.

Cingular, the predecessor to AT&amp;T, supported legacy D-AMPS/TDMA and analog wireless networks. In March 2006, Cingular announced that these networks would be shut down by February 2008. As of March 31, 2007, Cingular ended TDMA supported for GoPhone (pre-paid) customers. On July 15, 2007, AT&amp;T TDMA on 1900 MHz was retired, while TDMA on 850 MHz remained. On February 18, 2008, AT&amp;T Mobility officially ended service on their AMPS and remaining TDMA network, except for in areas previously operated by Dobson Communications; the Dobson AMPS and TDMA network was shut down March 1, 2008. Networks formerly operated by AT&amp;T predecessors including Cingular also include various paging services and the Cingular Interactive division, which became Velocita Wireless. Velocita was later purchased by Sprint Nextel. AT&amp;T also offered Enhanced Push To Talk (PTT) services on smartphones. The original PTT service was sunset.

The AT&amp;T wireless data network began in 2002 as a Cingular initiative called &quot;Project Genesis&quot; that involved a GPRS overlay of the entire wireless network. Project Genesis was completed by the end of 2004. Later, this network was upgraded to EDGE across the GSM footprint.

In 2005, AT&amp;T launched a broadband network known as &quot;BroadbandConnect&quot;, based on UMTS and HSDPA, to counter Verizon Wireless and Sprint&#x27;s EV-DO networks. UMTS service was launched on December 6, 2005, in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, San Jose, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Puerto Rico, Austin, Houston, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., and expanded to all major metropolitan markets by the end of 2006. As of early 2009, AT&amp;T Mobility has completed its upgrade of the 3G to HSUPA,

In 2011, it was reported that AT&amp;T would upgrade its network to HSPA+ throughout the year, which it would market as offering 4G-grade speeds. On September 18, 2011, AT&amp;T first launched LTE service in 5 U.S. metropolitan areas, with plans for serving 15 markets by the end of the year. AT&amp;T&#x27;s LTE rollout was noticeably slower than that of its competitor, Verizon Wireless, with the company stating that its then-proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA would be necessary. In November 2012, AT&amp;T promoted the network as serving 150 million users, with plans to double its coverage by 2014.

On January 1, 2017, AT&amp;T discontinued its 2G GSM network.

In April 2017, AT&amp;T announced that it would upgrade its existing LTE networks in selected markets to support LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro features, marketed as &quot;5G Evolution&quot; (5G &quot;E&quot;).

In January 2018, AT&amp;T stated that it intended to deploy 5G NR service by the end of the year.

On February 22, 2022, AT&amp;T discontinued its 3G UMTS network

AT&amp;T operates the second-largest 5G network in the U.S. with approximately 30% of the nation covered. AT&amp;T uses low, mid, and high band frequencies. Mid and high band 5G is marketed as 5G+ and offers much faster speeds than low band. Continuous expansion of the 5G network, especially mid-band 5G+, is planned through 2023. AT&amp;T plans to cover 200 million people with 5G+ by the end of 2023.

==Marketing==

===&quot;Fewest dropped calls&quot;===
During the first quarter of 2006, Telephia reported that during an extensive nationwide test of major wireless carriers in 350 metropolitan markets around the country, Cingular dropped the fewest calls across the country. In turn, Cingular began aggressively advertising the &quot;Allover Network&quot;, citing Telephia as &quot;the leading independent research company.&quot; Telephia&#x27;s report was in stark contrast to the Consumers Union publication, Consumer Reports, based on a survey of 50,000 of its members in 18 cities, which criticized Cingular for static and dropped calls. Furthermore, J.D. Power and Associates consistently ranked Cingular at or near the bottom of every geographical region in its 2006 Wireless Call Quality Study, which is based on a smaller survey of 23,000 wireless users. This campaign had to come to an abrupt end.

Telephia, which tests wireless networks by making over 6 million calls per year in what it claims is the world&#x27;s largest wireless network test program, initially refused to provide details on its study, and a spokesman for the company has said, according to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, that &quot;Cingular shouldn&#x27;t have even mentioned the company&#x27;s name to a reporter.&quot; The research company later stated that Cingular did, indeed, have a &quot;statistically significant lower dropped-call rate than the competition across some market/time period groupings&quot;, but that Telephia had &quot;no knowledge of the specific methodology (markets, time periods or statistical thresholds) that Cingular used for its &#x27;lowest dropped call&#x27; claim.&quot; While AT&amp;T has abandoned its verbal claim of &quot;The Fewest Dropped Calls&quot; in its commercials, it continues to show situations where two persons are speaking with each other on their phones, and one of the users&#x27; call drops. AT&amp;T now states &quot;We are still continuing to run ads that emphasize the importance of not dropping calls. That campaign is continuing.&quot;

===iPhone===
On June 29, 2007, Apple&#x27;s iPhone was introduced to the United States market, and AT&amp;T was the exclusive carrier for the device within the United States until February 10, 2011, when the iPhone 4 was launched on the Verizon network.

Teething problems with AT&amp;T&#x27;s billing process emerged soon after the iPhone&#x27;s release, as early adopters started receiving exceptionally detailed monthly telephone bills with one of the most notable being the 300-page iPhone bill that was featured in an online video by YouTube influencer iJustine.

Apple launched the iPhone 3G with AT&amp;T on July 11, 2008. Although specific AT&amp;T sales numbers are unavailable, Apple announced that over 1 million iPhone 3G devices were sold during the first three days — in contrast, according to Steve Jobs, Apple&#x27;s CEO, &quot;It took 74 days to sell the first one million original iPhones.&quot; In August 2008, Best Buy announced that it would begin selling the iPhone 3G for use on the AT&amp;T network. In September 2008, AT&amp;T announced that it would also sell the iPhone 3G in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The iPhone 4 was released on June 24, 2010. According to Apple, over 1.7 million iPhone 4 units were sold in the first few days, which is the most out of any phone ever sold. These sales propelled AT&amp;T to strong Q2 results.

The iPhone 5 was released on September 12, 2012. Apple reported selling 5 million iPhone 5&#x27;s in the first weekend. AT&amp;T activated 8.5 million iPhones in Q4 of 2012.

===Android-based smart phones===
On February 18, 2010, AT&amp;T announced that on March 7, 2010 it would introduce its first smart phone based on Google&#x27;s Android operating system, the Motorola Backflip.
On March 22, 2010, AT&amp;T announced that its second Android handset would be the Dell Aero, a revised version of the Dell Mini 3. However, the second Android phone AT&amp;T released was the HTC Aria which was announced on June 14, 2010 and released on June 20, 2010. The Samsung Captivate, which is part of the Galaxy S family, was released on AT&amp;T&#x27;s network on July 18, 2010. In addition to devices released on AT&amp;T were a line of handsets manufactured by Motorola. The Motorola Flipout, followed by the Motorola Flipside and the Motorola Bravo all run Android 2.1 and were all released Q4 2010. Three new 4G Android devices were announced for release within the first and second quarter of the fiscal year 2011, including the Motorola Atrix 4G, the HTC Inspire 4G, and the Samsung Infuse 4G. HTC Inspire 4G being the first, preceded by the Motorola Atrix 4G are, available through AT&amp;T&#x27;s 4G network. These three devices are all running Android 2.2 (Froyo) and are expected to be upgraded to Android 2.3 Gingerbread later in the year, along with an update to &quot;enable&quot; 4G uploads. Unlike other United States networks with Android-based phones, AT&amp;T did not allow non-market apps to be installed. However, on May 16, 2011 AT&amp;T announced that some current and future Android devices will come with an option to allow the installation of unofficial applications.

===4G LTE===
In a BBDO campaign for 4G and 4G LTE started in November 2012, Beck Bennett interviewed children in commercials directed by Jorma Taccone, with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s not complicated.&quot; The children were asked whether fast or slow is better, or whether two is better than one. Taccone said &quot;The spots are &#x27;guided&#x27; improv&quot;, meaning the children were allowed to be natural until others had to step in and help.

===In Need for Speed Games===
In the NFS games Underground 2 to Carbon, the network (as Cingular) was shown as the mobile internet provider in the ingame voice/text message.

==Current services==
AT&amp;T reintroduced unlimited plans in 2016; on launch, users were required to subscribe to an AT&amp;T-owned pay television service (DirecTV or U-verse) in order to be eligible. In April 2017, the Unlimited Plus plan was reduced in price, and a complimentary subscription to HBO (either as part of an AT&amp;T-owned pay television service, or standalone via HBO GO) was added to both plans. In June 2018, the two plans were discontinued for new subscribers and replaced by similar &quot;Unlimited &amp; More&quot; plans, which both include AT&amp;T&#x27;s new &quot;Watch TV&quot; service (which includes a selection of entertainment cable networks) at no charge, and Unlimited &amp; More Premium allowing users to also choose a premium subscription service (such as Cinemax, HBO, Showtime, Spotify, Starz, Amazon Music Unlimited, Pandora Premium, or VRV) as an add-on. The basic Unlimited &amp; More plan is restricted to standard definition video streaming.

===AT&amp;T Prepaid===
AT&amp;T Prepaid (stylized AT&amp;T PREPAID; formerly GoPhone) is a prepaid mobile phone service from AT&amp;T Mobility.

The GoPhone name and product were originally conceived and implemented by McCaw Cellular by its founder Craig McCaw and first used in commerce in 1987 by his company. It was later bought by AT&amp;T in 1995 and used by the pre-2004 &quot;AT&amp;T Wireless&quot; after Cingular&#x27;s purchase of AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004 for $41 billion. At that time, Cingular was jointly owned by SBC Communications (Southwestern Bell Corporation) of San Antonio, Texas, which owned 60 percent, and BellSouth of Atlanta, Georgia.

The original GoPhone service was discontinued and Cingular renamed its prepaid services under GoPhone. The GoPhone brand name was still in use even after &quot;Cingular&quot; renamed itself &quot;AT&amp;T Mobility&quot; until 2017 when it was rebranded AT&amp;T PREPAID.

As of January 2019, AT&amp;T Prepaid has 6 million subscribers.

===NumberSync===
NumberSync was introduced in 2015. The service allows AT&amp;T postpaid wireless customers to use one telephone number to send and receive calls and text messages across all of their supported devices.

==Slogans==

==Controversies==

===Misrepresentation of network technology===
====Misrepresentation as 4G====
In 2011, following a similar change by T-Mobile USA, AT&amp;T began marketing both its HSPA and HSPA+ services as &quot;4G&quot;, and distributed phone software patches changing their network indicators to identify these services as such. With the ITU having expanded its definition of 4G to include HSPA+, AT&amp;T decided to label 14 Mbit/s HSPA devices and service as HSPA+, and thus 4G. Standard HSPA service, however, never met 4G standards, nor are these HSPA devices (non-Evolved) actually capable of operating at HSPA+ speeds. Media outlets considered this branding to be deceptive. Concerns were also expressed over the possibility of confusion when actual 4G VoLTE networks were to be eventually deployed.

====Misrepresentation as 5G====
In 2017, AT&amp;T began to similarly use the trademark 5G Evolution (5G E) to refer to LTE networks upgraded to support higher data speeds via LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro features, such as 4x4 MIMO antennas, 256-QAM, and three-way carrier aggregation. AT&amp;T promotes these networks as having a theoretical top speed of 400 Mbit/s. In late-2018, AT&amp;T distributed phone software patches changing network indicators to refer to these networks as such.

5G Evolution is entirely unrelated to actual 5G wireless standards; AT&amp;T states that these technologies &quot;serve as the runway to 5G by boosting the existing LTE network and priming it for the future of connectivity&quot;, and argued that &quot;the customer doesn&#x27;t need to think about the exact technology – they only care on the performance and what it enables.&quot; AT&amp;T marketing likewise promotes this network with the slogan &quot;The First Step to 5G&quot;.

AT&amp;T once again faced allegations that the branding was misleading, because it is merely a rebranding of existing 4G networks in order to ride upon consumer anticipation of actual 5G technology. T-Mobile US and Verizon Wireless have deployed similar late-stage upgrades in a larger number of markets than AT&amp;T, but promote them as being upgrades to their 4G LTE service. T-Mobile mocked the branding via a video on Twitter, showing a person applying a sticky note reading &quot;9G&quot; over the LTE indicator on an iPhone, captioned &quot;didn&#x27;t realize it was this easy, brb updating&quot;. Technology website &quot;The Verge&quot; noted that the South American wireless carrier Claro had been using the branding &quot;4.5G&quot; (stylized to make the 4 slightly smaller than the 5) to promote similar upgrades to its LTE service, but felt that this brand was &quot;not as baldfaced a deception as AT&amp;T&#x27;s 5G E&quot;.

In February 2019, Sprint Corporation sued AT&amp;T Mobility for false advertising, presenting evidence that consumers were being misled into believing these services were of equal or higher performance than actual 5G networks. Sprint sought an injunction to halt AT&amp;T&#x27;s promotion of the network with this trademark. However, the two parties later settled, with AT&amp;T being allowed to continue to promote their network with the trademark.

In May 2020, following complaints by T-Mobile to the National Advertising Division, the National Advertising Review Board (NARB) recommended that AT&amp;T stop using &quot;5G Evolution&quot; or &quot;The First Step to 5G&quot; in advertising, as &quot;the term &#x27;Evolution&#x27; is not likely to alert consumers to the fact that the service is not 5G.&quot; AT&amp;T stated that it would not use &quot;5G Evolution&quot; or the slogan in future advertising, but that it will still use the 5G E logo, and not remove the indicator from devices.

===NASCAR sponsorship conflict===

Cingular Wireless began its sponsorship of the #31 Chevrolet, owned by Richard Childress Racing, in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 2002. Two years later, when Nextel Communications (now Sprint Corporation) purchased the naming rights to NASCAR&#x27;s top division (rebranding the division as the Nextel Cup, and later the Sprint Cup), Cingular and Alltel, sponsor of the #12 Dodge (owned by Penske Racing and driven by Ryan Newman), were allowed to stay as sponsors under a grandfather clause. In early 2007, following its purchase by AT&amp;T, Cingular began a re-branding effort to the AT&amp;T Mobility brand. NASCAR quickly claimed that a clause in their contract with Sprint Nextel (the Viceroy rule) would not allow Cingular to change either the name or brand advertised on the #31 car.

After trying and failing to persuade NASCAR to approve the addition of the AT&amp;T globe logo to the rear of the car, AT&amp;T filed a lawsuit against NASCAR on March 16, 2007. On May 18, AT&amp;T won a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta and, following a failed emergency motion for a stay by NASCAR on May 19, re-branded the #31 car, driven by Jeff Burton, in time for the Nextel All-Star Challenge that evening. NASCAR was later granted an appeal to be heard on August 2.

On June 17, NASCAR announced it had filed a US$100 million lawsuit against AT&amp;T and would like AT&amp;T and all other rival telecommunications companies out of the sport in 2008.

On August 13, a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit cleared the way for NASCAR to prevent AT&amp;T from featuring its logo on the car. The 11th Circuit dismissed a lower court&#x27;s ruling that prevented NASCAR from stopping AT&amp;T&#x27;s plans. The appeals court remanded the case to the district court.

At first practice for the Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway on August 24, the #31 car was colored orange and black, but was bare; that is, associate sponsors appeared, but no primary sponsors were on the car, similar to Formula One cars run in races where tobacco advertising is prohibited. The pit crew wore grey Richard Childress Racing shirts and Burton had a plain orange fire suit with associate sponsors. The car, which carried a &quot;subliminal advertising&quot; scheme, arrived in a black hauler with only the number 31 on the side. NASCAR officials said the car would not have made it through inspection with the AT&amp;T logos. During that weekend, AT&amp;T claimed that two alternate paint schemes proposed by AT&amp;T — one advertising its &quot;go phone&quot; and another with the old Cingular slogan &quot;more bars in more places&quot; that AT&amp;T recently brought back — were rejected by NASCAR. The Go Phone scheme had been used in the past. NASCAR later denied these claims.

On September 7, 2007, a settlement was reached where AT&amp;T Mobility could remain on the #31 car until the end of 2008, but the associate sponsorship of the #29 Nationwide Series Holiday Inn Chevrolet was not affected, because it is in a lower series.

No division of AT&amp;T have sponsored any organization in NASCAR since, even though the Viceroy rule changed from telecommunications companies to beverages when Monster Energy took over sponsorship of the Cup Series in 2017 before NASCAR removed series title sponsorship in the Cup Series altogether, effectively removing any restrictions on which brands can sponsor teams, pursuant to NASCAR approval. In fact, AT&amp;T&#x27;s parent division had sued a NASCAR team and driver it sponsored, Mike Borkowski, on performance grounds.

===Throttling of &quot;unlimited&quot; plans===
In 2012, AT&amp;T came under scrutiny for throttling the speed of data delivered to consumers with an unlimited data plan. The company has claimed that, despite its claim of network speeds, it is within its legal rights to reduce the speed of data to consumers who reach preset thresholds. In May 2012, Matt Spaccarelli, a truck driver, won a small claims lawsuit against the company for slowing down his service. A Simi Valley, California judge awarded Spaccarelli $850, agreeing that &quot;unlimited&quot; service shouldn&#x27;t be subject to slowdowns. Additionally, AT&amp;T&#x27;s user agreement does not permit class-action suits against the company.

In 2014, the FTC sued AT&amp;T for deceptive business practices. In November 2019, AT&amp;T agreed to pay $60 million to settle the suit, which must be distributed as a &quot;partial refund&quot; to customers who signed up for the affected plans prior to 2011. It also agreed to prominently disclose any throttling restrictions it imposes on its wireless plans in the future.

===Mobility Administrative Fee===
In May 2013, AT&amp;T added a 61 cent &quot;Mobility Administrative Fee&quot; per-month per-line to all of its wireless postpaid lines, including lines still under service contract. The fee appears &quot;below the line&quot; making it appear like a tax at the bottom of a customer&#x27;s phone bill. This fee is thought to bring more than a half-billion dollars in a year for AT&amp;T, which claims the fee is for covering the cost of cell sites and maintenance. In June 2018, AT&amp;T raised the administrative fee to $1.99 from 76 cents per-line.

=== Illegal location data sharing ===
In April 2024, AT&amp;T was fined $57 million by the FCC for illegally sharing access to customers&#x27; real-time location data. In response, AT&amp;T criticized the FCC&#x27;s decision, claiming it lacked &quot;both legal and factual merit.&quot;

<text>The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is the aggregate of the world&#x27;s telephone networks that are operated by national, regional, or local telephony operators. It provides infrastructure and services for public telephony. The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber-optic cables, microwave transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and undersea telephone cables interconnected by switching centers, such as central offices, network tandems, and international gateways, which allow telephone users to communicate with each other.

Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone systems, the PSTN is now predominantly digital in its core network and includes terrestrial cellular, satellite, and landline systems. These interconnected networks enable global communication, allowing calls to be made to and from nearly any telephone worldwide. Many of these networks are progressively transitioning to Internet Protocol to carry their telephony traffic.

The technical operation of the PSTN adheres to the standards internationally promulgated by the ITU-T. These standards have their origins in the development of local telephone networks, primarily in the Bell System in the United States and in the networks of European ITU members. The E.164 standard provides a single global address space in the form of telephone numbers. The combination of the interconnected networks and a global telephone numbering plan allows telephones around the world to connect with each other.

== History ==
Commercialization of the telephone began shortly after its invention, with instruments operated in pairs for private use between two locations. Users who wanted to communicate with persons at multiple locations had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. Alerting another user of the desire to establish a telephone call was accomplished by whistling loudly into the transmitter until the other party heard the alert. Bells were soon added to stations for signaling.

Later telephone systems took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a telephone exchange established for a town or area. For communication outside this exchange area, trunks were installed between exchanges. Networks were designed in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, states, and international distances.

Automation introduced pulse dialing between the telephone and the exchange so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long-distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long-distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges by the end of the 20th century.

The growth of the PSTN was enabled by teletraffic engineering techniques to deliver quality of service (QoS) in the network. The work of A. K. Erlang established the mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the capacity requirements and configuration of equipment and the number of personnel required to deliver a specific level of service.

In the 1970s, the telecommunications industry began implementing packet-switched network data services using the X.25 protocol transported over much of the end-to-end equipment as was already in use in the PSTN. These became known as public data networks, or public switched data networks.

In the 1980s, the industry began planning for digital services assuming they would follow much the same pattern as voice services and conceived end-to-end circuit-switched services, known as the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). The B-ISDN vision was overtaken by the disruptive technology of the Internet.

At the turn of the 21st century, the oldest parts of the telephone network still used analog baseband technology to deliver audio-frequency connectivity over the last mile to the end-user. However, digital technologies such as DSL, ISDN, FTTx, and cable modems were progressively deployed in this portion of the network, primarily to provide high-speed Internet access. 

, operators worldwide are in the process of retiring support for both last-mile analog telephony and ISDN, and transitioning voice service to Voice over IP via Internet access delivered either via DSL, cable modems or fiber-to-the-premises, eliminating the expense and complexity of running two separate technology infrastructures for PSTN and Internet access.

Several large private telephone networks are not linked to the PSTN, usually for military purposes. There are also private networks run by large companies that are linked to the PSTN only through limited gateways, such as a large private branch exchange (PBX).

== Operators ==
The task of building the networks and selling services to customers fell to the network operators. The first company to be incorporated to provide PSTN services was the Bell Telephone Company in the United States.

In some countries, however, the job of providing telephone networks fell to government as the investment required was very large and the provision of telephone service was increasingly becoming an essential public utility. For example, the General Post Office in the United Kingdom brought together a number of private companies to form a single nationalized company. In more recent decades, these state monopolies were broken up or sold off through privatization.

== Technology ==
=== Network topology ===
The architecture of the PSTN evolved over time to support an increasing number of subscribers, call volume, destinations, features, and technologies. The principles developed in North America and in Europe were adopted by other nations, with adaptations for local markets.

A key concept was that the telephone exchanges are arranged into hierarchies, so that if a call cannot be handled in a local cluster, it is passed to one higher up for onward routing. This reduced the number of connecting trunks required between operators over long distances, and also kept local traffic separate. Modern technologies have brought simplifications

=== Digital channels ===
Most automated telephone exchanges use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The trunks connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used to connect the last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical phone call from a calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse-code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.

The call is carried over the PSTN using a 64 kbit/s channel, originally designed by Bell Labs. The name given to this channel is Digital Signal 0 (DS0). The DS0 circuit is the basic granularity of circuit switching in a telephone exchange. A DS0 is also known as a timeslot because DS0s are aggregated in time-division multiplexing (TDM) equipment to form higher capacity communication links.

A Digital Signal 1 (DS1) circuit carries 24 DS0s on a North American or Japanese T-carrier (T1) line, or 32 DS0s (30 for calls plus two for framing and signaling) on an E-carrier (E1) line used in most other countries. In modern networks, the multiplexing function is moved as close to the end user as possible, usually into cabinets at the roadside in residential areas, or into large business premises.

These aggregated circuits are conveyed from the initial multiplexer to the exchange over a set of equipment collectively known as the access network. The access network and inter-exchange transport use synchronous optical transmission, for example, SONET and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) technologies, although some parts still use the older PDH technology.

The access network defines a number of reference points. Most of these are of interest mainly to ISDN but one, the V reference point, is of more general interest. This is the reference point between a primary multiplexer and an exchange. The protocols at this reference point were standardized in ETSI areas as the V5 interface.

=== Impact on IP standards ===
Voice quality in PSTN networks was used as a benchmark for the development of the Telecommunications Industry Association&#x27;s TIA-TSB-116 standard on voice-quality recommendations for IP telephony, to determine acceptable levels of audio latency and echo.

== Regulation ==
In most countries, the government has a regulatory agency dedicated to provisioning of PSTN services. The agency regulate technical standards, legal requirements, and set service tasks may be for example to ensure that end customers are not over-charged for services where monopolies may exist. These regulatory agencies may also regulate the prices charged between the operators to carry each other&#x27;s traffic.

== Service retirement ==
In the United Kingdom, the copper POTS and ISDN-based PSTN is being retired in favour of SIP telephony, with an original completion date of December 2025, although this has now been put back to January 2027. See United Kingdom PSTN switch-off. Voice telephony will continue to follow the E.163 and E.164 standards, as with current mobile telephony, with the interface to end-users remaining the same.

Several other European countries, including Estonia, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, have also retired, or are planning to retire, their PSTN networks.

Countries in other continents are also performing similar transitions.

<text>The Santa Susana Mountains are a transverse range of mountains in Southern California, north of the city of Los Angeles, in the United States. The range runs east-west, separating the San Fernando and Simi valleys on its south from the Santa Clara River Valley to the north and the Santa Clarita Valley to the northeast. The Oxnard Plain is to the west of the Santa Susana Mountains.

==Description==

===Geography===
The Newhall Pass separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the San Gabriel Mountains to the east. Newhall Pass is the major north-south connection between the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, and Interstate 5 and a railroad line share Newhall Pass. The Santa Susana Pass (containing SR 118) connects the Simi and San Fernando valleys, and separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the Simi Hills to the south. Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park is located in the Simi Hills, just south of the Santa Susana Pass, at the northwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley. The Santa Susana Mountains are not as steep or high as the San Gabriel Mountains.

The western half of the range lies in Ventura County, and the eastern half lies in Los Angeles County. The southeastern slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains are part of the City of Los Angeles, and housing subdivisions, including Porter Ranch, have been built on the lower slopes of the range. The city of Simi Valley lies to the southwest. North of the range is the fast-growing city of Santa Clarita, and several large subdivisions in unincorporated Los Angeles County, including Lyons Ranch and Newhall Ranch, have been approved for development. The Sunshine Canyon Landfill is at the mountains&#x27; eastern end, and several canyons in the northwest corner of the range have been proposed for more landfills.

The Santa Susana Mountains are paralleled by State Route 118 to the south and State Route 126 to the north.

===Climate===
The mountains have a mild climate, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters (Mediterranean climate type). Snow falls in winter in some higher areas, such as Oat Mountain, but melts quickly. Annual precipitation totals vary between 18 and 25 inches, depending on exposure to the rain-bearing winds. Most of the rain falls between November and March. Because of the summer drought, wildfires sometimes occur in summer and fall before the rains start, especially during hot, dry &quot;Santa Ana&quot; wind events (mostly between late September to mid November).

===Peaks===
The highest peaks in the range are Oat Mountain (1,142 m; 3,747 feet), Mission Point (845 m; 2,771 feet), Rocky Peak (827 m; 2,714 feet), and Sand Rock Peak (765 m; 2,511 feet). The summit of Rocky Peak lies directly atop the line separating Ventura and Los Angeles counties and is indicated by a battered marker embedded into the sandstone boulder summit.

==History==

The first discovery of oil in California was in Pico Canyon, on the north side of the mountains, The California Star Oil Works, later Chevron, succeeded with &quot;Pico Well No. 4&quot;. It became famous not only as the first well in California, but also as the longest-producing well in the world, having been capped in September, 1990 after 114 years. Well No. 4 has the distinction of being the first site in Los Angeles County to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1966. The surrounding town, Mentryville, is maintained as the oil &quot;ghost town&quot; Mentryville Historical Park, within Pico Canyon Park. Many active oil and gas fields remain in the area, with some of the larger operators including Vintage Production, Freeport McMoRan, and the Southern California Gas Company. The largest of SoCalGas&#x27;s four underground storage natural gas facilities is within the Aliso Canyon Oil Field north of Porter Ranch.

The mountains are within the acquisition area for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which operates several parks, including Santa Clarita Woodlands Park, Rocky Peak Park, Joughin Open Space Preserve, Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park, and other Santa Susana parks in the Santa Susana Mountains through the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. The City of Los Angeles maintains O&#x27;Melveny Park at the eastern end of the mountains.

Note: the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, once operated by and still owned by Rocketdyne until toxics are cleaned up, is actually in the Simi Hills, which are adjacent to the south of the Santa Susana Mountains.

==Plants and animals==

===Flora===
The south-facing slopes are mostly covered in Chaparral shrubland, grasslands, and oak savanna. The north-facing slopes are home to magnificent oak woodlands and conifer (fir) woodlands, some of which have been protected in the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park and other large open space preserves. The mountains are part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The oaks, (&quot;Quercus spp.&quot;), include the evergreen coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), the deciduous valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;), and the coastal scrub oak (&quot;Quercus dumosa&quot;) all can be found in the area. Spring wildflowers include the redbush monkey flower, Mariposa lily, and canyon sunflower. Poison oak is also an important member of the native plant habitat community. Various ferns are found in moister and tree-shaded areas.

===Fauna===
Many bird species thrive in the Santa Susana Mountains. Perhaps the most common raptors observed soaring over the brushy, boulder-strewn landscape are turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks, and American kestrels. In oak woodlands it is not uncommon to see red-shouldered hawks flying from limb to limb. Through the cover of dense, trailside chaparral you might glimpse the California towhee or the colorful spotted towhee, birds who often make their presence known by rustling up leaf litter on the ground. California quail, greater roadrunner, and common raven are also residents of the range. The eerie and enchanting call of the common poorwill can often be heard after dark while quick eyes might observe the silent flight of great horned owls and phantom-like barn owls.

A handful of fascinating amphibians live in the area. Streams and creeks support populations of Pacific tree frog, the small amphibian whose signature chorus adds an aura of mystery and inexplicable beauty to the surrounding land. Western toads often make their appearance at nightfall, emerging from burrows in search of water and insects, while California slender salamanders are often found under the cool leaf litter and canopy of oak woodlands. Many reptiles thrive in the Santa Susana range. Lizards that are likely to be observed on any given day include the common western fence lizard and the equally abundant side-blotched lizard. Somewhat less frequently observed but still present are the southern alligator lizard, western skink, whiptail, and the seemingly rare coast horned lizard. Southern Pacific rattlesnakes and gopher snakes are perhaps the most commonly observed snakes, but a lucky hiker might also encounter other species including the striped racer, California kingsnake, and ring-necked snake.

Mammals that may be regularly observed in the mountains include smaller animals such as the California ground squirrel and brush rabbit. Small mammals that are less often seen include the dusky-footed woodrat and the agile kangaroo rat. As for larger mammals, the well-trained eye might spot California mule deer or a coyote. Larger mammals that are considerably more secretive and therefore less often encountered include the gray fox, bobcat, ring-tailed cat, American badger, and the mountain lion. A population of American black bears occupy various niches in the backcountry; showing up in communities below the mountains every few years.

The mountains are part of the Southern California coastal wildlife corridor the connects Los Padres National Forest with the Santa Monica Mountains.

==Rim of the Valley Trail==

The Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for connecting the parkland and recreational areas of the San Fernando, Simi, and La Crescenta Valleys via the Santa Susana Mountains. Rocky Peak Park and O&#x27;Melveny Park have trail sections already.

<text>Grenadiers or rattails are generally large, brown to black gadiform marine fish of the subfamily Macrourinae, the largest subfamily of the family Macrouridae. Found at great depths from the Arctic to Antarctic, members of this subfamily are amongst the most abundant of the deep-sea fish.

The macrourins form a large and diverse family with 28 extant genera recognized (well over half of the total species are contained in just three genera, &quot;Coelorinchus&quot;, &quot;Coryphaenoides&quot;, and &quot;Nezumia&quot;). They range in length from about in &quot;Hymenogadus gracilis&quot; to in &quot;Albatrossia pectoralis&quot;. Several attempts have been made to establish a commercial fishery for the most common larger species, such as the giant grenadier, but the fish is considered unpalatable, and attempts thus far have proven unsuccessful. The subfamily as a whole may represent up to 15% of the deep-sea fish population.

Rattails, characterized by large heads with large mouths and eyes, have slender bodies that taper very much to very thin caudal peduncles or tails (except for one species without a caudal fin): this rat-like tail explains the common name &quot;rattail&quot; and the name of the subfamily and the surname are derived from the Greek makros meaning &quot;big&quot; and Oura meaning &quot;tail&quot;. The first dorsal flat is small, tall and pointed (and may have rays modified into spines); The second dorsal fin runs along the rest of the back and connects to the tail and the large anal fin. The scales are small.

As with many deep-living fish, the lateral line system in grenadiers is well-developed; it is further aided by numerous chemoreceptors located on the head and lips and chemosensory barbels underneath the chin. Benthic species have swim bladders with unique muscles attached to them. The animals are thought to use these muscles to &quot;strum&quot; their bladders and produce sound, possibly playing a role in courtship and mate location. Light-producing organs, photophores, are present in some species; they are located in the middle of the abdomen, just before the anus and underneath the skin.

Grenadiers have been recorded from depths of about , and are among the most common benthic fish of the deep (however, two genera are known to prefer the midwater). They may be solitary or may form large schools, as with the roundnose grenadiers. The benthic species are attracted to structural oases, such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and shipwrecks. They are thought to be generalists, feeding on smaller fish, pelagic crustaceans, such as shrimp, amphipods, cumaceans, and less often cephalopods and lanternfish. As well as being important apex predators in the benthic habitat, some species are also notable as scavengers.

As few rattail larvae have been recovered, little is known of their life histories. They are known to produce a large number (over 100,000) of tiny ( in diameter) eggs made buoyant by lipid droplets. The eggs are presumed to float up to the thermocline (the interface between warmer surface waters and cold, deeper waters) where they develop. The juveniles remain in shallower waters, gradually migrating to greater depths with age.

Spawning may or may not be tied to the seasons, depending on the species. At least one species, &quot;Coryphaenoides armatus&quot;, is thought to be semelparous; that is, the adults die after spawning. Nonsemelparous species may live to 56 years or more. The macrourins, in general, are thought to have low resilience; commercially exploited species may be overfished and this could soon lead to a collapse of their fisheries.

<doc id="468454" wikidata="Q615075" url="?curid=468454" title="Screaming for Vengeance">
<text>Screaming for Vengeance is the eighth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 1 July 1982 by Columbia Records. Considered the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in North America, it has been certified double platinum in the United States and platinum in Canada. &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; spawned the hit &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot;, which became one of the band&#x27;s signature songs and a perennial radio favourite.

==Recording and release==
&quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; was recorded at Ibiza Sound Studios, Ibiza, Spain (during this period, it was common for UK-based musicians to record in continental Europe for tax purposes). Mixing and overdubs were done at Beejay Recording Studios in Orlando, Florida and Bayshore Recording Studios in Coconut Grove, Florida.

It showcased a harder, heavier sound than &quot;British Steel&quot; and saw the band revert back into straight heavy rock after the melodically styled &quot;Point of Entry&quot;. The album also marks the first time a drummer played on more than two Judas Priest albums, with Dave Holland having also played on &quot;British Steel&quot; and &quot;Point of Entry&quot;.

The album&#x27;s most commercially successful track, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin, was a last-minute addition. According to guitarist K. K. Downing, &quot;We were quite happy with the album, but decided late on that we could add one more song. I know we had some of the parts, but we set about completing &quot;Another Thing Comin during the mixing sessions at Bee Jay studios. It came together quite quickly, and I seem to remember that we all had a good feeling about it, as it did sound like a good driving song and possibly a good radio track.&quot; Rob Halford expressed surprise at the song&#x27;s success, saying &quot;that track was buried. Normally the tracks you think are going to do stuff are at the front end of the release. But our friends at Sony said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to go for this song.&#x27; And we didn&#x27;t really know what was going on. But then the feedback was coming over: &#x27;Hey, the record&#x27;s buzzing in this town and that town&#x27;, and it just took off.&quot;

&quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; was released in July 1982, with a remastered CD released in May 2001. &quot;Fight for Your Life&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; sessions , was left off but subsequently reworked as the song &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; on the next album, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;. The original version saw the light of day as a bonus track on the 2001 remastered version of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Killing Machine&quot;. As of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2012, it remains the top-selling release of Judas Priest&#x27;s career. To celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a remastered CD with bonus 1982 live tracks and a bonus DVD of the band&#x27;s performance from the 1983 US Festival were released. The most recent remaster was released in late 2017 as part of the Sony We Are Vinyl series, on vinyl and digital download only.

==Tour==
The World Vengeance Tour began shortly after the album&#x27;s release in July 1982 and focused on North America during the summer and fall, Priest not performing in Europe until December 1983. This emphasis on US audiences was in order to establish a solid commercial foothold there, and in particular because &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin became a major hit. That and &quot;Electric Eye&quot; became live setlist staples and some of the band&#x27;s most performed songs. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Child&quot; has also been performed on various tours between 1982 and 2008, and &quot;Riding on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Bloodstone&quot; and the title track have also been in the setlist on various tours. For comparison, &quot;Fever&quot; was only played at the first two 1982 shows, &quot;(Take These) Chains&quot; only appeared in the setlist in 2019, while &quot;Pain and Pleasure&quot; and the instrumental &quot;The Hellion&quot; have never been performed live (though a recording of the song is frequently played before performances of &quot;Electric Eye&quot;). The 30th-anniversary release of the album in 2012 came with a DVD of a live show recorded in May 1983 at the US Festival in California on the last date of the Screaming For Vengeance Tour. During the US tour to support the album in 1982, Judas Priest were supported by bands such as Iron Maiden, Krokus, and Uriah Heep.

==Reception==

While 1980&#x27;s &quot;British Steel&quot; has been referred to as the band&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; was Judas Priest&#x27;s breakthrough in North America. Although the band had achieved a cult following among American audiences by 1979 and could headline their own tours, they sold &quot;relatively few&quot; records there before &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;. It was also extremely successful worldwide.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; reached No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Pop Albums. It was certified gold by the RIAA on 29 October 1982, platinum on 18 April 1983, and 2× platinum on 16 October 2001, being the band&#x27;s first album to achieve the two latter awards.

===Accolades===
The album ranked 15th on IGN&#x27;s 25 most influential metal albums. &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; also came 10th on Metal-Rules.com&#x27;s 100 greatest metal albums. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed the album at No. 46 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2017, it was ranked 12th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; was named #2 of &#x27;The 25 greatest rock guitar albums of 1982&#x27; list in Guitar World.

==In popular culture==
&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin is featured as a playable track in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. &quot;Electric Eye&quot; (with the accompanying intro track &quot;The Hellion&quot;) was playable in &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot;. The entire album was the first album released as downloadable content for the video games &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;.

The title song &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; was played on the main site for the video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. In the game, Rob Halford voices a villain named General Lionwhyte, as well as a heroic character called the Fire Baron, modeled after his likeness. The track &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin was featured in the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; as part of the V-Rock radio station, whilst &quot;Electric Eye&quot; was featured on the same radio station in the 2006 prequel &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;. The song &quot;Riding on the Wind&quot; was featured in the 2012 video game &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;.

As well as &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin featuring in the eleventh season&#x27;s first episode, &quot;Archer&quot; continues the running gag of Dr. Krieger&#x27;s vans with &quot;Screaming for Van-geance&quot; featuring in the episode &quot;Helping Hands&quot;. 

The bonus track &quot;Prisoner of Your Eyes&quot; was featured in the 2024 slasher movie MaXXXine.

<doc id="468455" wikidata="Q484125" url="?curid=468455" title="Democratic Labor Party (South Korea)">
<text>The Democratic Labor Party () was a progressive and nationalist political party in South Korea. It was founded in January 2000, in the effort to create a political wing for the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions which was considered more left-wing and more independent of the two union federations in South Korea. Its party president was Kwon Young-gil, Kang Gi-gap, and Lee Jung-hee. In December 2011, the party merged into the Unified Progressive Party.

In the South Korean political history, DLP is considered as the ancestor of all of modern day left-leaning political parties such as Justice Party and Progressive Party.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The origins of the Democratic Labor Party can be traced back to two major groups: National Liberation (민족해방, NL) and People&#x27;s Democracy (민중민주, PD). These were student movements active in the Korean democratization movement of the 1987, with differing perspectives on Korean society. NL regarded South Korean society as a colony of American imperialism(), while PD characterized it as a highly developed capitalist system(). As a result, NL advocated for national liberation through solidarity with North Korea, whereas PD championed socialism through working-class struggle.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, traditional student movements began to decline. Among the PD group, some leaders, including Roh Hoe-chan, embraced the concept of a social democratic mass party over the Marxist-Leninist vanguard party model. Consequently, a significant portion of the PD faction moved away from Marxism, adopting the idea of a Nordic-style social market economy.

For NL, the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994 led to a split between the autonomy-innovation(자주 혁신) faction and the autonomy-unity faction(자주 단결). While the unity faction continued to uphold traditional Juche ideology, the innovation faction supported popular nationalist movements that diverged from Juche principles. In 2000, following intense debates at Gunjasan(), leaders of the innovation faction resolved to form a mass party and engage in central politics.
=== 1997-2004 ===
The predecessor of the Democratic Labor Party was People&#x27;s Victory for 21st Century, established in 1997. People&#x27;s Victory for 21st Century nominated KCTU Chairman Kwon Young-ghil as its candidate in the 1997 presidential election, but the campaign was unsuccessful. However, after reorganizing into the Democratic Labor Party just before the 2000 general election, the party made significant progress in several constituencies.

In the 2002 local elections, the Democratic Labor Party garnered an average of 8% of the votes, establishing itself as a major political force. The party gained support from prominent cultural figures, including director Bong Joon-ho, and attracted significant backing from young people and the working class who were disillusioned with the politics of the two dominant parties; the democratic party and the conservative Hannara-party. In the 2004 general election, the Democratic Labor Party gained 10 seats, becoming the third-largest party in the National Assembly.
=== 2004-2008 ===
After its success in the 2004 general election, the Democratic Labor Party faced internal conflict between the PD faction and the NL faction. The PD faction formed the social democratic “Pyeongdeung-faction ()”, while the NL faction established the pro-North Korean “Jaju-faction ()”. The Pyeongdeung-faction primarily promoted social welfare policies, such as “free welfare” and “free medical care.” In contrast, the Jaju-faction focused on a Korean reunification agenda, which centered on anti-Americanism.

The Pyeongdeung-faction gained public support due to its popular welfare policies; however, within the party, it struggled to build strong support among members because of its individualistic organizational style and perceived elitist bias. Conversely, the Jaju-faction had lower public support but cultivated significant internal support due to its communitarian culture.

In the 2006 leadership election, the Pyeongdeung-faction nominated former National Assembly member Cho Seung-soo as their candidate for party leader, while the Jaju-faction nominated labor activist Moon Sung-hyun. The election was closely contested, with Moon Sung-hyun narrowly winning 53.6% of the vote to Cho Seung-soo&#x27;s 46.4%, giving the Jaju Faction the upper hand in the party.

Controversy soon followed. Lee Yong-dae, the leader of the Jaju-faction, who was also a policy committee chairman, blocked the Pyeongdeung-faction&#x27;s resolution criticizing North Korea for its nuclear test. Chairman Lee argued that North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons were defensive measures against American imperialism, which was severely condemned by media. Furthermore, during the 2007 presidential election, the Jaju-faction pushed an unpopular slogan advocating for “a federation of North and South Korea.()” This contributed crushing defeat for the party, receiving only 3% of the popular vote.

The defeat in the presidential election prompted the Pyeongdeung-faction to establish an emergency committee led by Sim Sang-jung. One of the key issues addressed by this committee was the &quot;Ilsimhoe Incident (),&quot; a 2006 controversy in which some party members were found to have contacted executives of North Korea&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party and provided them some critical information about key party members. The Pyeongdeung-faction advocated for the immediate expulsion of those involved, while the Jaju-faction opposed such actions, arguing that the party should not succumb to anti-communist pressure.

Ultimately, a narrow vote favored the Jaju-faction&#x27;s stance. Frustrated with the outcome, the Pyeongdeung-faction left the Democratic Labor Party in February 2008 to establish the New Progressive Party, citing irreconcilable differences with the Jaju-faction&#x27;s pro-North Korean tendencies. The party split proved detrimental to both factions. In the 2008 general election, the Democratic Labor Party won only five seats, while the New Progressive Party failed to secure any seats.

=== 2008-2011 ===
After the crushing defeat in the 2008 general election, contrary to experts’ expectations, the Democratic Labor Party quickly regained its footing. Amid growing public discontent with the Lee Myung-bak administration&#x27;s ultra-conservative and pro-American policies, the Democratic Labor Party restored public trust by leading protests against the United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement. The controversy surrounding key agreements in the Korea-US FTA also bolstered support for the anti-American stance of the Jaju-faction.

The Democratic Labor Party further strengthened its position by coordinating protests with the KCTU against the Lee Myung-bak administration&#x27;s anti-labor policies. Simultaneously, it adopted some policies previously championed by the Equality Faction, such as advocating for “free school meals.” Prominent party figures, like Lee Jung-hee, gained public attention by vocally opposing the conservative Grand National Party in the National Assembly.

In the 2010 local elections, the Democratic Labor Party achieved a significant victory, gaining 150 seats in total—the best performance by a left-wing party in Korea to date. Many of these victories were attributed to the formation of an “opposition alliance ()” with the liberal Democratic Party. However, the division within the left-wing camp, split between the New Progressive Party and the Democratic Labor Party, posed challenges during the election.

In response to this fragmentation, the Democratic Labor Party initiated efforts to reunite with the New Progressive Party in 2011. Around the same time, the Participation Party, founded by former Minister of Health and Welfare Rhyu Si-min, also joined the DLP&#x27;s left-wing reorganization efforts. In December 2011, the three parties agreed to merge, leading to the establishment of the Unified Progressive Party.

==Political position==
The Democratic Labor Party was originally considered as a democratic socialist party, including some left-wing nationalist ideologies. The party strongly opposed two-party system in South Korea, and represented the broad left-wing tendencies against the major liberal and conservative parties.
In 2008, the socialist-leaning &#x27; () left the party after the ideological dispute about North Korea and established the New Progressive Party. After the party split, remained nationalist-leaning &#x27; () tried to make a partnership with major liberal Democratic Party. From the 2010 local elections, the party joined an electoral coalition with the Democratic Party.
In June 2011, the Democratic Labor Party removed &quot;socialism&quot; from the party code and replaced the phrase &quot;socialism&quot; () with &quot;progressive democracy&quot; (), a liberal ideology.
==Factions==
DLP was divided into the Jaju-faction(), which advocated leftist nationalism, and the Pyeongdeung-faction(), which advocated democratic socialism.

The Jaju-faction operated as a single caucus, National Union(). It was divided into sub-groups based on regional activities, such as Eastern Gyongggi Union(), Gwangju-Jeonnam Union(), Ulsan Union(), etc. The Jaju-faction became the mainstream of the party after 2004. Pronounced politicians of the Jaju-faction included Lee Jung-hee, Kim Seon-dong, and Lee Yong-dae.

On the other hand, the Pyongdeung-faction was severely divided into various caucuses. The most representative group was Jeonjin(), which advocated eco-socialism. Jeonjin succeeded Daejangjeong(), a left-wing Althusserian student group in Seoul National University.

Yeondae() was a centre-left caucus, advocated a Nordic-style social market economy and western social democracy. Its leader was Joo Dea-hwan, a former party chairman. The most radical caucus in Pyeongdeung-faction was Haebang yeondae(), which advocated Eurocommunism and Neo-marxism.

Dahamkke(, current Worker&#x27;s Solidaty) was also belonged to the Pyeongdeung-faction. However, it defended the Jaju-faction in major decisions, which made them classified as a neutral caucus. Dahamkke was an official branch office of Socialist Workers Party in United Kingdom. Dahamkke followed Tony Cliff&#x27;s thought on Marxism, which called as neo-Trotskysm or International socialism.

<text>Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! is an American franchise founded by Robert Ripley, which deals with bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper panel, the &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including radio, television, comic books, a chain of museums, and a book-series.

The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the Orlando, Florida-based Ripley Entertainment, Inc. (a division of the Jim Pattison Group) hosts more than 12 million guests annually. Ripley Entertainment&#x27;s publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.

==Syndicated feature panel==

Ripley called his cartoon feature (originally involving sports feats) &quot;Champs and Chumps&quot; when it premiered on December 19, 1918 in &quot;The New York Globe&quot;. He began adding items unrelated to sports and in October 1919, he changed the title to &quot;Believe It or Not&quot;. When the &quot;Globe&quot; folded in 1923, he moved to the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by Associated Newspapers, (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the &quot;Globe&quot;). That same year, Ripley hired Norbert Pearlroth as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.

Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the &quot;New York American&quot; and was picked up by the King Features Syndicate, being quickly syndicated on an international basis.

Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included Paul Frehm (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), Bob Clarke (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; for &quot;Mad&quot;, as did Wally Wood and Ernie Kovacs, who also did a recurring satire called &quot;Strangely Believe It!&quot; on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak&#x27;s &quot;Our Own Oddities&quot;, John Hix&#x27;s &quot;Strange as It Seems&quot;, and Gordon Johnston&#x27;s &quot;It Happened in Canada&quot;. Don Wimmer took up the panel from 1989 to 2004. John Graziano from 2005 to 2021. The current artist is Kieran Castaño, who is supported by the Ripley&#x27;s Research Team.

At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers; during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.

&quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog Spike was &quot;a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades&quot;. Said dog would later became the model for Snoopy.

Ripley Entertainment produces a range of books featuring unusual facts, news stories and photographs. In 2004, Ripley Entertainment founded Ripley Publishing Ltd, based in the United Kingdom, to publish new &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; titles. The company produces &quot;the New York Times&quot; bestselling &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Annuals&quot;, the children&#x27;s fiction series &quot;Ripley&#x27;s RBI&quot;, an educational series called the &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Twists&quot;, the &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Special Edition&quot; in conjunction with Scholastic USA and a number of other titles. At the height of his popularity, Robert Ripley received thousands of letters a day from the public and Ripley Entertainment continues to encourage submissions from readers who have strange stories and photographs that could be featured in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; books and media.

The people whose items are featured in such books as &quot;Strikingly True&quot; have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc., describes as an obsession: &quot;Whatever it is they&#x27;re after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me&quot;. Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the collection, alien or witchcraft-type stories are rarely considered as they are (according to Meyers) difficult to prove. To be included in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; books, museums or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from the staff and be 100% authenticated.

==Comic books==
In 1953, Harvey Comics published the first &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; comic book, titled &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Magazine&quot; and lasted for four issues until March 1954.

From 1965 until 1980, Gold Key Comics published the second &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; comic book, which lasted for 94 issues.

In 2002, Dark Horse Comics published the third &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; comic book, written by Haden Blackman, which lasted for three issues and was later collected in a trade paperback published by Dark Horse in May 2003, entitled &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; ()

In 2015, Zenescope published a two issue comic edited by Terry Kavanagh.

==Radio==
On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; to radio, the first of several series heard on NBC, CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System. As noted by the website Ripley On Radio, Ripley&#x27;s broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley&#x27;s 1930 debut on &quot;The Collier Hour&quot; brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Party&quot;, Ripley was the host of &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Broadcast&quot; from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. &quot;See America First with Bob Ripley&quot; (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into &quot;See All the Americas&quot;, a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on World War II. &quot;Romance, Rhythm and Ripley&quot; aired on CBS in 1945, followed by &quot;Pages from Robert L. Ripley&#x27;s Radio Scrapbook&quot; (1947–48).

Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean and he also participated in the first broadcast from Buenos Aires to New York City. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.

As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included Pall Mall cigarettes and General Foods. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to television.

==Films, television, Internet, and computer game==
The newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows.

===Film===
* Ripley hosted a series of two dozen &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; theatrical short films between 1930 and 1932 for Warner Bros. Vitaphone. A 2-DVD release featuring 24 of these theatrical shorts is available in the United States beginning March 16, 2010, from Warner Home Video, through their Warner Archive manufacture-on-demand program. Directors on the shorts included Murray Roth (on the first five), Roy Mack and Alfred J. Goulding (latter half of second season). Leo Donnelly assisted later on commentary.
* He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, &quot;Seasons Greetings&quot; (1931), with Ruth Etting, Joe Penner, Ted Husing, Thelma White, Ray Collins, and others.
* Ripley&#x27;s short films were parodied in a 1939 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon titled &quot;Believe It or Else&quot;. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by Tex Avery and written by Dave Monahan, it featured a running gag in which a prototype Elmer Fudd appeared to declare, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it!&quot; On November 5 of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, &quot;Fresh Fish&quot;, was released. Written by Jack Miller, this cartoon&#x27;s running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, &quot;Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?&quot;
* 20th Century Fox produced another short film, &quot;Acquitted by the Sea&quot;, that was produced by Truman Talley and directed by Earl Allvine. It was released on September 27, 1940 and told an unusual story involving the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

====Proposed film====
In October 2004, Paramount Pictures announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film was to be produced by James Jacks and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired to write the script. Jacks explained: &quot;It&#x27;s about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened. We want to turn it into an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, a goofy version, as played by Johnny Depp. When they saw we had the writers from &quot;Larry Flynt&quot;, they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a Spielberg-type movie with one of their characters&quot;.

In November 2005, Tim Burton was attached to direct the film, with Jim Carrey starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a &quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; film series. In addition to Jacks, Sean Daniel and Richard D. Zanuck were to serve as producers for the film. Zanuck spent six weeks in China to scout filming locations for the project.

In June 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film&#x27;s script to focus more on Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;.

In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer Steve Oedekerk to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release. Later in January, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding. Oedekerk&#x27;s draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008. Later that month, Paramount was searching for a new director.

In October 2008, Chris Columbus pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus&#x27; idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a &quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; film series. In January 2011, Eric Roth was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.

===Television===

* The first &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; TV series, a live show hosted by Ripley, premiered on the NBC television network on March 1, 1949. Shortly after the 13th episode, on May 27, Ripley died of a heart-attack and several of his friends substituted as host, including future &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; president Doug Storer. Robert St. John served as host from the second season until the series ended on October 5, 1950. 
* In 1956, an unsold pilot was made by Trident Productions. Stories include the invention of streptomycin and a story on George Gershwin.
* A revival of the original series, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, aired from 1982 to 1986 on the ABC television network. Based on three pilots/specials conceived, produced and directed by Ron Lyon and Jack Haley, Jr. (1980–81), the series was a Haley/Lyon/Rastar production in association with Columbia Pictures Television. Featuring film star Jack Palance who hosted the popular series throughout its run, the series had three different co-hosts who appeared from season to season (initially actress Catherine Shirriff, followed by Palance&#x27;s daughter, Holly Palance, and later singer Marie Osmond). The 1980s series reran on the British and American versions of the Sci-Fi Channel during the 1990s; it last aired on NBCUniversal&#x27;s horror/suspense-themed cable channel Chiller. 
* A Canadian animated series, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, was produced for Fox Family in 1999 by Cinar (now WildBrain), and followed the adventures of &quot;Michael Ripley&quot;, Robert Ripley&#x27;s nephew. The show was aimed at a younger audience, and would often feature Michael going around the world.
* Another revival, once again titled &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, aired from 2000 to 2003, produced by Columbia TriStar Television and shown on TBS. Hosted by actor Dean Cain, executive-produced by Dan Jbara and co-executive-produced by Dennis Lortz, the series took a slightly more sensationalistic approach to its subject matter and &quot;premiered as the highest-rated original series on cable&quot; at that time. The series was canceled in October 2003 after four seasons. Like the previous syndicated live-action series, this latest edition was later aired on The Biography Channel, Chiller and Decades for reruns.
* In 2006, the Philippines made a local adaptation of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not!&quot; with a local host. ABC 5 (now known as TV5) was the first to make it with Raymond Bagatsing as host. The show however was short-lived.
* In 2008, GMA Network bought the rights and revived &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; in the Philippines. This time Chris Tiu of the Ateneo Blue Eagles was chosen as host. It is part of the &quot;Bilib Ka Ba? Nights/Araw-araw&quot; (&quot;Do You Believe? Nights/Daily&quot;) programming block of the network which premiered on August 18, 2008, and lasted until September 22, 2010.
* In 2012, a composite parody of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; dubbed &quot;The Guinness O&#x27;Ripley Enormous Book of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records&quot; served as the focus of the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Squirrel Record&quot;, in which the title character assists his friend Sandy Cheeks in breaking the records within.
* Another revival, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (produced by Texas Crew Productions with Bruce Campbell as host), premiered on the Travel Channel in 2019.

===Internet and games===
* A point-and-click adventure computer game, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!: The Riddle of Master Lu&quot;, was published and developed by Sanctuary Woods and released in 1995.
* In 2004, a &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; pinball machine was released.
* In 2006, the Ripleys.com website held a &quot;Dear Mr. Ripley&quot; contest in which contestants submitted &quot;unbelievable&quot; stories and with a public vote selecting a winner. The submissions included stories about a two-faced kitten, a car hurdler, a painting on human flesh canvas, a snake swallowing a golf ball, an unopened deck of cards in a thin-necked bottle, a collector of Converse shoes with over 400 pairs, a man who survived a dump truck falling on him, a painting made of nail polish, a child who played sports while hopping on a pogo stick, and a tongue swallower. The winners were announced on December 15 of the same year.

==Museums (&quot;Odditoriums&quot;)==

When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1933, it was labeled Ripley&#x27;s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair (in an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who &quot;fainted&quot; daily). That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s and his collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including San Francisco, San Diego, Dallas, and Cleveland. In New York City, the famed Times Square exhibit opened in 1939 on Broadway. In 1950, a year after Ripley&#x27;s death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in St. Augustine, Florida. The Odditorium is housed in the Castle Warden, built in 1888 by an associate of Henry Flagler, President of the Florida East Coast Railway.

, there are 28 &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums (in the spirit of &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot;) are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. Others are constructed oddly, such as the Orlando, Florida Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking (a commemoration of a sinkhole that opened on the site while construction was in progress).

Before becoming home to his vast collections from his many travels, &quot;The Castle&quot;, as it is known, was once a hotel which played host to many famous guests, including Ripley and author/owner Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. It was originally a Moorish Revival style mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home. Its popularity and success led Ripley&#x27;s associates to open new establishments throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is rumored to be haunted. Segments of the most recent Ripley&#x27;s TV series were filmed here, including the opening credits.

* Gatlinburg – The original museum was built in 1970. On July 14, 1992, a fire started from a neon light fixture in a neighboring T-shirt shop. It quickly spread and engulfed a total of twelve businesses in one city block and damaged almost every building along the main street. From that Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, firefighters managed to get the situation under control, but the Ripley&#x27;s Odditorium was one of the twelve to be completely consumed. Some of Ripley&#x27;s most prized and unique possessions were lost in the fire, although some artifacts were able to be salvaged. The museum was rebuilt and opened in 1994 with nearly twice the amount of exhibit space, plus a tribute to the city&#x27;s firefighters included among the collections. Artifacts salvaged from the blaze sport decals saying &quot;I Survived the Fire&quot;. As with other Ripley museums, it has an architectural theme by looking as if it has survived a major earthquake, with interior and exterior feature cracks throughout. The Ripley&#x27;s Company has since opened several other attractions in the Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge area, including a &quot;four-dimensional&quot; theater, a state-of-the-art aquarium, a haunted factory, several arcades, two miniature golf courses, and a mirror maze, all of which carry the Ripley&#x27;s brand name and logo.

==Inaccuracies==
Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on its television show, where they often say &quot;If you see it on &quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot;, you can bet that it&#x27;s real&quot;. However, two claims appearing in their books have been dubbed &quot;myths&quot; by the Discovery Channel television show &quot;MythBusters&quot;. One claim which had previously appeared in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; books, concerning an &quot;accidental&quot; execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners when something uttered by Napoleon Bonaparte was misunderstood, has had its accuracy challenged by Snopes.

&quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; has reported the urban legend of Frank Tower - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;, and RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; - as being factual, but this story has been debunked by several sources.

&quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; has also repeated the Muhlenberg legend, which claims that German was once one vote short of becoming the official language of the United States.

&quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; has mentioned a well-known myth that claims the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon with the naked human eye. 

==In popular culture==
The 2013 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; features a business called Bishop&#x27;s WTF on Vinewood Boulevard, based on the Ripley&#x27;s located on Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="468466" wikidata="Q1378146" url="?curid=468466" title="European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization">
<text>CENELEC (; ) is responsible for European standardization in the area of electrical engineering. Together with ETSI (telecommunications) and CEN (other technical areas), it forms the European system for technical standardization. Standards harmonised by these agencies are regularly adopted in many countries outside Europe which follow European technical standards. Although CENELEC works closely with the European Union, it is not an EU institution. Nevertheless, its standards are &quot;EN&quot; EU (and EEA) standards, thanks to EU Regulation 1025/2012.

CENELEC was founded in 1973. Before that two organizations were responsible for electrotechnical standardization: CENELCOM and CENEL. CENELEC is a non-profit organization under Belgian law, based in Brussels. The members are the national electrotechnical standardization bodies of most European countries.

==Agreement types==
===Members===
The current members of CENELEC are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

=== Affiliates ===
Albania, Belarus, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Libya, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, Tunisia and Ukraine are currently &quot;affiliate members&quot; with a view to becoming full members.

===Others===
CENELEC has cooperation agreements with: Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and an informal agreement with the USA.

== History ==
After the Dresden Agreement (1996), CENELEC coordinates standard development activities with IEC. Older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027 and the same standards are also published in the EN 60000 series to indicate adoption by CENELEC as a European standard; for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034. Regional European standards issued by CENELEC, which are not adopted IEC standards, are numbered in the EN 50000 series.

, more than 90% of the standards passed by CENELEC used the Dresden Agreement process. The alternative process in which a member National Committee proposes a standard is called the Vilamoura process (or procedure).

The Dresden Agreement was updated with the Frankfurt Agreement in October 2016, and decisions are detailed in CENELEC Guide 13 (2016). Following the publication of this guide, IEC standards adopted by CENELEC shall be referenced as &quot;EN IEC 6xxxx&quot;.

===Voting===
, a weighted voting system was in place, with member countries having the following number of votes:
* France, Germany, Italy, and UK: 10 votes (each)
* Spain: 8 votes
* Belgium, Greece, Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland: 5 votes
* Austria and Sweden: 4 votes
* Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Norway: 3 votes
* Luxembourg: 2 votes
* Iceland: 1 vote

For a proposal to pass, 71% of members need be in favor (according to weighted system above) or 71% of EEA members need be in favor (excluding Switzerland).

 this system was updated as follows:
* France, Germany, Italy, UK (non-EU), Turkey (non-EU): 29 votes (each)
* Poland and Spain: 27 votes
* Romania: 14 votes
* Netherlands: 13 votes
* Belgium, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, and Portugal: 12 votes
* Austria, Bulgaria, Sweden, and (non-EU) Switzerland: 10 votes
* Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia, and (non-EU) Norway: 7 votes
* Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and (non-EU) North Macedonia: 4 votes
* Malta and (non-EU) Iceland: 3 votes

The weighted voting standard was maintained at 71%, meaning that if the 17 largest-weight countries vote for a standard it will pass (this also means the top 50% [by weight] countries voting in favor). If a proposal does not pass this way, a second vote taking into account only EU members is taken, with the threshold again being 71%. However, unlike EU member states, non-EU CENELEC member countries are not required to transfer EN standards into national standards (although they usually do so).

<doc id="468485" wikidata="Q257495" url="?curid=468485" title="Night of the Stormrider">
<text>Night of the Stormrider is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released in 1991 through Century Media Records. It is a concept album centered on an idea that was created by the band&#x27;s leader Jon Schaffer. &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; is the only Iced Earth album to feature lead singer John Greely and drummer Rick Secchiari. The album was re-released in a remixed and remastered version in 2002 by producer Jim Morris.

==Concept meaning==
The album&#x27;s concept is about a man who is betrayed by religion and turns away from it in anger. The dark forces of nature reach out to this enraged man and use him as their vessel to bring death and destruction to Earth. He is commanded to travel to a desert, where he is given visions that reveal the truth of humanity, and warp his mind further to make him the &quot;Stormrider&quot;. After the destruction of the world, he is then damned forever into the depths of Hell, also referenced as the River Styx. After being forever damned and taunted by evil spirits, he eventually sees what he has done, and realizes that it is too late to repent.

== Track listing ==
All lyrics and music written by Jon Schaffer, except where noted.

<doc id="468486" wikidata="Q766678" url="?curid=468486" title="Macrouridae">
<text>Macrouridae is a family of deep sea fish, a diverse and ecologically important group, which are part of the order of cod-like fish, the Gadiformes. The species in the Macrouridae are characterised by their large heads which normally have a single barbel on the chin, projecting snouts, and slender bodies that taper to whip-like tails, without an obvious caudal fin but what there is of the caudal fin is often confluent with the posterior dorsal and anal fins. There are normally two dorsal fins, the anterior dorsal fin is quite high, the posterior quite low but is longer and takes up a greater proportion of the fish&#x27;s back. Species in the subfamily Macrouroidinae have a single dorsal fin. The long anal fin is almost as long as the posterior dorsal fin, and sometimes it is longer. The pelvic fin is inserted in the vicinity of the thorax and normally has 5–17 fin rays but these are absent in &quot;Macrouroides&quot;. The body is covered in small scales and if they have a photophore, it is usually on the midline of the abdomen just in front of the anus. The bioluminescence of these fish is produced by symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. The structure of the skull has been used to show their placing in the Gadiformes, but they differ from the typical cods in that they possess one stout spine in the anterior dorsal fin.

The species in this family are mainly benthopelagic, they are found at depths of 200–2000 m, they occur on the sea bed and have a wide distribution from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The species in the Macrouridae normally live near the sea bed on the continental slope, however, some species are bathypelagic or mesopelagic, other species occur on the outer continental shelf. Their bodies are loose in texture rather than firm and they are weak swimmers. Some species are of commercial importance to fisheries. 
==Subfamilies==
There are four subfamilies within the Macrouridae:

*Bathygadinae: contains 2 genera and 26 species 
*Macrourinae: contains 28 genera and 370 species
*Macrouroidinae: contains 2 monotypic genera 
*Trachyrincinae contains 2 genera and 7 species 
The earliest known genus is &quot;Bobbitichthys&quot; , a stem-macrourid from the middle Paleocene of Denmark. A well-preserved skull of an indeterminate macrourid is known from the Eocene-aged La Meseta Formation of Antarctica. The extinct genus &quot;Bolbocara&quot; is known from an articulated fossil skeleton from the Late Miocene of California, while &quot;Razelaina&quot; is known from the Late Miocene of Algeria.

<doc id="468491" wikidata="Q6789698" url="?curid=468491" title="Matteo Ricci College">
<text>Matteo Ricci College, one of eight schools and colleges at Seattle University in Washington state, offers three degrees: the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities for Teaching (BAHT), the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities for Leadership (BAHL), and the Bachelor of Arts in humanities (BAH). The BAHT, a 4-year pre-education degree, and the BAHL, a 4-year leadership degree, are open to students from anywhere in the world. The BAH is a 3-year degree open to select students from Seattle Preparatory and five other high schools in the area, while those completing an on-line offering are also able to apply.

==Background==
The college is named after the 16th-century Jesuit missionary to China Matteo Ricci, who worked closely with the local people learning from the Chinese while simultaneously sharing European ideas. Ricci College unites the efforts of a Jesuit college and high school that had been founded together in 1891. It was initiated in 1975 in response to the 1973 call by Jesuit Father General Pedro Arrupe that Jesuit schools educate men and women for others, a theme taken up by the Jesuit Secondary Education Association in the United States. It would require students to become more active learners, through less lecturing and more seminars, student interchange, and essays. Funding came from the Carnegie Foundation. The high school part of the Ricci program has been described on the University of Washington website as a &quot;well-known dual enrollment program&quot;.

==Programs==
From 1975, Seattle Prep students completed the Bachelor of Arts in humanities (BAH) with just three years of high school and three years of college. In 1984 Prep re-established a fourth year for students who needed it. In 1988 Ricci College opened its doors more widely to the 3-year BAH for students from five local Catholic schools, beginning with O&#x27;Dea and Kennedy Catholic and later adding Eastside Catholic, Forest Ridge and Archbishop Murphy high schools who completed university classes during their senior year of high school. Since 2015 students who successfully complete one or more of Seattle University&#x27;s online offerings with the Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy are also eligible to apply for the BAH degree.

In 2002, Matteo Ricci College launched the BAH for Teaching degree, and in 2011 the college added the BAH for Leadership degree. Each of the three degrees is built on the humanities curriculum as a foundation for further studies.

==Student activism==
In 2016 students in the program succeeded in having the dean of Ricci College removed for, in their view, focusing the program too narrowly on Western ideas and history and for failing to address issues like social justice, gender differences, poverty, and mass incarceration. These issues are raised by the Poverty Education Center of Ricci College, which &quot;promotes the teaching of issues such as inequality, underdevelopment, and injustice at all levels of education and to a variety of audiences. It provides teachers and students with a deep, humanistic understanding of the economics, politics, history, culture, and ethics of poverty in the United States and around the world.&quot; It was noted that University of California Davis and the University of Washington were going through somewhat similar struggles, as regards racism, at the time. The students were also protesting that Dean recommended Dick Gregory&#x27;s autobiography &quot;&quot; – though Gregory came to the dean&#x27;s support.

<doc id="468494" wikidata="Q1700027" url="?curid=468494" title="John F. Tierney">
<text>John F. Tierney (born September 18, 1951) is an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts from 1997 to 2015. He is a Democrat who represented the state&#x27;s , which includes the state&#x27;s North Shore and Cape Ann.

Born and raised in Salem, Massachusetts, Tierney graduated from Salem State College and Suffolk University Law School. He worked in private law and served on the Salem Chamber of Commerce from 1976 to 1997. Tierney first ran for the House of Representatives in 1994 against Republican incumbent Peter G. Torkildsen, losing by a small margin. He defeated Torkildsen in a rematch in 1996.

A liberal member of Congress, Tierney voted along with other Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where his priorities included green energy and increased college access. He co-authored several pieces of legislation, including the Green Jobs Act of 2007 and the College Affordability and Accountability Act of 2008. He is the former chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, where he helped establish the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 1998 to 2010, Tierney comfortably won re-election in each cycle. He faced tougher challenges after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2010, narrowly defeating his Republican opponent in 2012. In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election. In February 2016, Tierney was appointed the executive director of the Council for a Livable World and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the council&#x27;s affiliated education and research organization.

==Early life, education, and career==
John F. Tierney was born September 18, 1951, in Salem, Massachusetts. His mother, Doris H. (née Gelineau) Tierney, was a Salem native who worked a split shift at the New England Telephone Company, where she remained for 42 years. His father, Albert R. Tierney, was a bookkeeper for Nabisco and a local fuel company. Tierney was one of three children, along with his brother Michael A. and sister Catherine. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of half French-Canadian and half Irish ancestry. He moved with his family to his grandmother&#x27;s home when he was five years old. He began working at the Kernwood Country Club in Salem as a caddie when he was 8 and soon adopted a paper route. He later attended Salem High School. When he was young, Tierney campaigned for his uncle, a Peabody ward councilor, and he ascribes his political interest in part to this experience.

Tierney attended Salem State College, majoring in political science. While in college he performed work study, while also stocking shelves at a grocery store, working in sales at a clothing store, and performing deliveries. For three years he was president of his class, and in his final year he served as President of the Salem State Student Government Association (SGA). As SGA president Tierney responded to racial incidents on campus by organizing a school-wide meeting leading to several days of discussion. He graduated in 1973, and returned in 2009 to give a commencement address, receiving an honorary degree.

While working as a law office clerk and a State House janitor, Tierney attended Suffolk University Law School. Tierney graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1976, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Tierney worked as a solo practitioner until 1981, when he became a partner at the North Shore community law firm Tierney, Kalis, &amp; Lucas. Tierney remained at the firm until taking office in 1997. Tierney served on the Salem Chamber of Commerce from 1976 to 1997, becoming the organization&#x27;s president in 1995.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican incumbent Peter G. Torkildsen, having won a competitive Democratic primary with a plurality of 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney&#x27;s positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated in the general election by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.

In his 2012 race for re-election, Tierney faced former State Senator and 2010 nominee for Lieutenant Governor Richard Tisei. Tisei, who is openly gay, was endorsed by the Log Cabin Republicans. He was also endorsed by &quot;The Rainbow Times&quot;, a Boston-based LGBT newspaper. Gay Democratic Congressman Barney Frank endorsed Tierney, likening gay Republicans to Uncle Tom. Tierney narrowly won re-election on November 6, 2012, with 48% of the vote to Tisei&#x27;s 47%.

Tierney ran for re-election against four challengers for the Democratic nomination in 2014. With 27 percent of precincts reporting, Tierney trailed Seth Moulton 51 percent to 40 percent and conceded.

===Tenure===

Tierney, described as &quot;an unwavering liberal&quot; by &quot;CQ&#x27;s Politics in America&quot;, has consistently high approval ratings from Democratic and liberal interest groups such as Americans for Democratic Action, and low approval ratings from conservative groups such as the American Conservative Union. His votes have been closely aligned with the other Democratic representatives from his state. Described as &quot;a favorite of the House Democratic leadership,&quot; he maintains a close relationship with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; her daughter Christine Pelosi served as his chief of staff from 2001 to 2005. Tierney was speculated as a candidate to succeed United States Senator Ted Kennedy in a special election after Kennedy&#x27;s death in 2009, but he decided not to run. In 2010 Washington paper &quot;The Hill&quot; published a speculation that Tierney, with a $1.3 million war chest, was a likely candidate to run against Kennedy&#x27;s successor Scott Brown in the 2012 election. Tierney later stated that he would not contest the Senate seat and would instead seek a ninth term as Congressman.

====Domestic policy====

Tierney and Rep. Hilda Solis coauthored the Green Jobs Act of 2007, which allocated $125 million to green jobs training. The bill was incorporated into the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and signed into law. Tierney was initially opposed to the Troubled Asset Relief Program proposal of 2008, although he ultimately voted for the bill, saying, &quot;The state of panic in the markets compels Congress to act.&quot;

The House included several of his proposals in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, one which prevented states from cutting education funding as federal aid increased, and one which forgave federal loans for students who went into some public service professions. Throughout his career, Tierney has repeatedly introduced a bill called &quot;Clean Money, Clean Elections&quot;, which would create a national, publicly financed clean elections system. With little support in Congress, the proposal has been unsuccessful.

Tierney is a supporter of universal health care. In early 2010, Tierney came under fire from some in his district for his support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

On March 6, 2013 Tierney and several House Democrats walked out on a Committee on Education and the Workforce vote, accusing Republican counterparts on the committee of not negotiating &quot;in a bipartisan manner.&quot; Tierney has introduced a version of Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s &quot;Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act&quot; into the House, which would reduce federally subsidized education loans to 0.75%, the rate paid by banks.

A February 2012 &quot;Washington Post&quot; report revealed that 33 members of Congress helped direct more than $300 million in earmarks to public projects in close proximity to commercial and residential real estate owned by the lawmakers or their family members. According to the investigation, Tierney has helped direct about $3.5 million toward a 950-space parking garage and commuter rail station in Salem, Mass. The facility will be located roughly 1/4 mile from a commercial building Tierney co-owns.

====Foreign policy====
Tierney was a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs during the 110th and 111th Congresses. Tierney introduced the 2007 House legislation that created the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan to study government contracting related to the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. The same year Tierney chaired a congressional hearing over conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The center had been criticized in the press for its dilapidated conditions and inadequate care, as well as for prioritizing a &quot;VIP ward&quot; for non-soldiers. The House approved Tierney&#x27;s amendment to direct $75,000,000 to secular school construction in Pakistan to compete against Islamic madrassas.

Tierney is a critic of U.S. investment in missile defense, and has called for large budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency. He introduced an amendment to redirect $966 million in funding from missile defense systems to other military initiatives. The proposal, opposed by Armed Services Committee leaders as &quot;going too far&quot;, was rejected in a House vote.

==Personal life==
Tierney dated Patrice M. (Eremian) Chew of Marblehead throughout his 1996 campaign. They married in a small ceremony in April 1997 and now live in Salem, where Patrice works as a jewelry designer. Tierney has three stepchildren from his wife&#x27;s first marriage. In June 2000, Tierney&#x27;s stepson John Chew was arrested when about 25 grams (0.9 oz) of cocaine and $1,000 in cash were found in his Marblehead apartment.

===Wife&#x27;s tax fraud conviction===
In August 2010, Tierney&#x27;s wife Patrice&#x27;s brothers Robert and Daniel Eremian were indicted in federal court for operating an illegal internet gambling business. Robert had allegedly, with Daniel&#x27;s help, operated the business out of St. John&#x27;s, Antigua and Barbuda, and funneled a portion of the profits into a Bank of America account in Massachusetts. In October 2010, Patrice was charged in U.S. District Court with four counts of &quot;aiding and abetting the filing of false tax returns&quot; by Robert. John Tierney issued a statement announcing his wife&#x27;s intention to plead guilty, stating that Patrice accepted &quot;full responsibility for being &#x27;willfully blind&#x27; to what her brother was doing.&quot; Patrice pleaded guilty on October 6, 2010, and on January 13, 2011, was sentenced to 30 days in prison followed by five months of house arrest. The conviction bolstered the campaign of Bill Hudak, Tierney&#x27;s Republican opponent in the November 2010 election, but Tierney was re-elected. In June 2012, a federal judge ordered Daniel Eremian to forfeit $7.7 million in assets for his role in the illegal offshore sports betting scheme. Following his sentencing, Daniel Eremian told reporters that the congressman &quot;knew everything that was going on&quot;, a charge which Tierney rebutted.

<doc id="468524" wikidata="Q831567" url="?curid=468524" title="Turbo (Judas Priest album)">
<text>Turbo is the tenth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released in the UK on 7 April 1986 by Columbia Records. The album is notable for the band&#x27;s change to a commercial glam metal sound, that had them using synthesizers for the first time.

A remastered CD was released in 2001, including two bonus tracks. On 3 February 2017, the album was reissued as &quot;Turbo 30&quot; for its 30th anniversary, including two CDs of a live performance at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri, on 22 May 1986.

==Overview==
Following the success of their previous album, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;, Judas Priest initially recorded a double album which was intended to be released under the title &quot;Twin Turbos&quot;, half of which would be more commercial and the other half would be aggressive heavy metal. This idea was scrapped. Instead, the material was split up, with the more commercial songs appearing as the album &quot;Turbo&quot;. The lyrical content on &quot;Turbo&quot; was markedly different from previous Judas Priest albums, with more emphasis on grounded subjects such as love and romance rather than the band&#x27;s usual sci-fi and fantasy themes. On the whole, it was a response to the changed music scene of the mid-1980s which was becoming focused more on light, synth-driven pop rather than the driving hard rock of the 1970s to early 1980s.

After concluding the Metal Conqueror World Tour at the end of 1984, the band took their first-ever extended hiatus and did not perform at all during 1985 except for an appearance at the Live Aid Concert where only three songs were played. Work began on &quot;Turbo&quot; that summer and finished late in the year. During this time, singer Rob Halford struggled with increasing substance abuse and violent feuds with his romantic partner. After the latter committed suicide, he resolved to get clean and so checked into rehab where he spent a month during December 1985 – January 1986.

With the album being released in April 1986, &quot;Turbo&quot; was an instant commercial success. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on 10 June 1986 and Platinum on 24 July 1989. The album reached No. 33 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, marking the apex of Priest&#x27;s commercial success and being the band&#x27;s highest chart position until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;. The music videos supporting &quot;Turbo Lover&quot; and &quot;Locked In&quot; enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV, furthering the success of the album commercially.

The cover was once again done by graphic artist Doug Johnson, who designed the &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; covers.

&quot;Reckless&quot; was asked to be on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, but Judas Priest declined, both because they thought the film would flop and because it would have meant leaving the song off &quot;Turbo&quot;. However, their next album, &quot;Ram It Down&quot;, contained a cover of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; that was featured in the soundtrack for the movie of the same title. &quot;Reckless&quot; and &quot;Wild Nights, Hot &amp; Crazy Days&quot; were also Judas Priest&#x27;s first songs to be played lower than E tuning.

&quot;Parental Guidance&quot; was allegedly written as a response to Tipper Gore&#x27;s attack on the band, and heavy metal in general, in the mid-1980s. Her organization, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), had placed the band&#x27;s song &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; (from &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;) at No. 3 on their list of offensive songs, referred to as the &quot;Filthy 15&quot;. The PMRC alleged that the song was obscene because it encouraged the performance of oral sex at gunpoint.

==Reception==

&quot;Turbo&quot; sold well initially, and was certified Gold by the RIAA on 10 June 1986 and Platinum on 24 July 1987. It reached No. 33 in the UK and No. 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest chart position until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;. The album would be Priest&#x27;s final platinum-selling album. Sales tapered off and the subsequent live album from the otherwise successful Fuel for Life tour did not sell as well, only going Gold after a string of Platinum certified albums.

Seven of the album&#x27;s nine songs were performed during the Fuel for Life tour with &quot;Hot for Love&quot; being the least played of those. The title track has remained in the band&#x27;s set lists since then and &quot;Out in the Cold&quot; reappeared in 2019. During the tour, the band also dispensed with the black leather and studs look they&#x27;d sported since 1978 and went for a slightly more colourful &quot;glam&quot; leather wardrobe. A number of older songs such as &quot;Sinner&quot; and &quot;Exciter&quot; were also dropped from the live setlist, leading K. K. Downing to remark &quot;People ask why we don&#x27;t play Sinner anymore. I tell them it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve all repented.&quot;

Rob Halford referred to &quot;Turbo&quot; as the &quot;love/hate Judas Priest album&quot;. In 2008 he told &quot;Kerrang!&quot;: 

Despite &quot;Turbo&quot;&#x27;s achievement and reception, Downing said that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t the big-selling album that we hoped for. I think quite a lot of that went on with the acceptability and success of a lot of other bands that you would look at on MTV. Even Ozzy went to the hairdressers.&quot; In his 2020 memoir &quot;Confess&quot;, Halford admitted that he now sees his lyrics on &quot;Turbo&quot; as subpar, stating that his alcohol and substance abuse at the time had started to take their toll on his writing process.

<doc id="468536" wikidata="Q1361055" url="?curid=468536" title="Discrete group">
<text>In mathematics, a topological group &quot;G&quot; is called a discrete group if there is no limit point in it (i.e., for each element in &quot;G&quot;, there is a neighborhood which only contains that element). Equivalently, the group &quot;G&quot; is discrete if and only if its identity is isolated. 

A subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a topological group &quot;G&quot; is a discrete subgroup if &quot;H&quot; is discrete when endowed with the subspace topology from &quot;G&quot;. In other words there is a neighbourhood of the identity in &quot;G&quot; containing no other element of &quot;H&quot;. For example, the integers, Z, form a discrete subgroup of the reals, R (with the standard metric topology), but the rational numbers, Q, do not. 

Any group can be endowed with the discrete topology, making it a discrete topological group. Since every map from a discrete space is continuous, the topological homomorphisms between discrete groups are exactly the group homomorphisms between the underlying groups. Hence, there is an isomorphism between the category of groups and the category of discrete groups. Discrete groups can therefore be identified with their underlying (non-topological) groups.

There are some occasions when a topological group or Lie group is usefully endowed with the discrete topology, &#x27;against nature&#x27;. This happens for example in the theory of the Bohr compactification, and in group cohomology theory of Lie groups.

A discrete isometry group is an isometry group such that for every point of the metric space the set of images of the point under the isometries is a discrete set. A discrete symmetry group is a symmetry group that is a discrete isometry group.

==Properties==
Since topological groups are homogeneous, one need only look at a single point to determine if the topological group is discrete. In particular, a topological group is discrete only if the singleton containing the identity is an open set.

A discrete group is the same thing as a zero-dimensional Lie group (uncountable discrete groups are not second-countable, so authors who require Lie groups to have this property do not regard these groups as Lie groups). The identity component of a discrete group is just the trivial subgroup while the group of components is isomorphic to the group itself.

Since the only Hausdorff topology on a finite set is the discrete one, a finite Hausdorff topological group must necessarily be discrete. It follows that every finite subgroup of a Hausdorff group is discrete.

A discrete subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is cocompact if there is a compact subset &quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;HK&quot; = &quot;G&quot;.

Discrete normal subgroups play an important role in the theory of covering groups and locally isomorphic groups. A discrete normal subgroup of a connected group &quot;G&quot; necessarily lies in the center of &quot;G&quot; and is therefore abelian.

&quot;Other properties&quot;:
*every discrete group is totally disconnected
*every subgroup of a discrete group is discrete.
*every quotient of a discrete group is discrete.
*the product of a finite number of discrete groups is discrete.
*a discrete group is compact if and only if it is finite.
*every discrete group is locally compact.
*every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed.
*every discrete subgroup of a compact Hausdorff group is finite.

==Examples==
* Frieze groups and wallpaper groups are discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the Euclidean plane. Wallpaper groups are cocompact, but Frieze groups are not.
* A crystallographic group usually means a cocompact, discrete subgroup of the isometries of some Euclidean space. Sometimes, however, a crystallographic group can be a cocompact discrete subgroup of a nilpotent or solvable Lie group.
* Every triangle group &quot;T&quot; is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the sphere (when &quot;T&quot; is finite), the Euclidean plane (when &quot;T&quot; has a Z + Z subgroup of finite index), or the hyperbolic plane. 
* Fuchsian groups are, by definition, discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane. 
** A Fuchsian group that preserves orientation and acts on the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane is a discrete subgroup of the Lie group PSL(2,R), the group of orientation preserving isometries of the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane.
** A Fuchsian group is sometimes considered as a special case of a Kleinian group, by embedding the hyperbolic plane isometrically into three-dimensional hyperbolic space and extending the group action on the plane to the whole space.
** The modular group PSL(2,Z) is thought of as a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R). The modular group is a lattice in PSL(2,R), but it is not cocompact.
* Kleinian groups are, by definition, discrete subgroups of the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. These include quasi-Fuchsian groups.
** A Kleinian group that preserves orientation and acts on the upper half space model of hyperbolic 3-space is a discrete subgroup of the Lie group PSL(2,C), the group of orientation preserving isometries of the upper half-space model of hyperbolic 3-space.
* A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup such that the Haar measure of the quotient space is finite.

<doc id="468537" wikidata="Q7695740" url="?curid=468537" title="TeleZapper">
<text>The TeleZapper is a device designed to reduce the number of telemarketing-related phone calls a household receives by imitating the tone signal normally played by a phone company to indicate a line has been disconnected. The Telezapper was created by Privacy Technologies.

== Background ==
Telemarketing companies typically use predictive dialers to place many calls simultaneously. When the equipment detects that someone has answered one of the many calls it has made, it quickly transfers that call to an available agent. Unanswered calls, or numbers that are disconnected, are not transferred to agents and the call is terminated automatically.

In this way, the agent is spared the time of dialing a call and waiting for an answer, and can simply speak to waiting calls that have been already set up. Additionally, if a number is determined to be disconnected, the equipment will usually mark that number as such and will not dial it again or as often.

== How it works ==
The TeleZapper is an appliance that plugs into a consumer telephone line. On detecting a ring and answer of any phone on the line, the Telezapper will immediately play a sequence of Special information tones or &quot;SIT&quot;: one of eight internationally standardized signals that indicate a call cannot be completed. Typically the &quot;Intercept&quot; or &quot;IC&quot; SIT is used, indicating the number called has been disconnected or changed.

By playing this tone signal on the line, a predictive dialer calling the household would hear it, assume the number was disconnected, terminate the call and likely mark the number as &quot;disconnected&quot; in its database.

This &quot;tricking&quot; of the telemarketer&#x27;s equipment was effectively highlighted in marketing material for the TeleZapper as a way to get revenge on the &quot;obnoxious telemarketers&quot;. The device is powered by a CR2032 battery, which is not documented in the manual and is replaced by opening the unit.

== Limitations of the TeleZapper ==
A predictive dialer merely checks for three conditions:
*A SIT signal, as described above,
*a short response, like &quot;hello&quot;, in which case it puts the called person through to a salesperson, and
*a long response, such as an answering machine message, in which case it hangs up and re-queues the number to call back later or leaves a sales message.

Some telemarketing firms have turned off the SIT tone detector altogether in response to the TeleZapper trick, rendering it wholly ineffective.

Another limitation is that the device does not work well with voice mail systems. This is because voice mail reroutes the call from a physical line to the voice mail service without the phone ever picking up.

<text>Dennis Ray Rehberg (born October 5, 1955) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party. He served as the lieutenant governor of Montana from 1991 to 1997 and as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2013. Rehberg was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 1996 and 2012, losing to Democratic incumbents Max Baucus 49% to 44% and Jon Tester 48% to 44%, respectively. He subsequently became a co-chairman at Mercury, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm. In 2024, Rehberg ran for US Congress in Montana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, but was defeated in the Republican primary. 

== Early life, education, and ranching career ==
Rehberg was born in Billings, Montana, the son of Patricia Rae (née Cooley) and Jack Dennis Rehberg. His ancestry includes German, Irish, and Scottish. He attended Billings West High School and Montana State University before transferring to Washington State University where he earned his Bachelor of Arts in public administration.

From 1996 to 2001, Rehberg managed the Rehberg Ranch near Billings. He oversaw a herd of 500 cattle and 600 cashmere goats. After being elected to Congress, Rehberg gave up ranching, citing the difficulty of managing a herd whilst travelling between Montana and Washington D.C.

== Early political career ==

=== Staffer ===
In 1977 he began working as an intern in the Montana State Senate, and two years later he joined the Washington, D.C. staff of Montana U.S. Congressman Ron Marlenee as a legislative assistant. In 1982, Rehberg returned to farming, until running for the State House in 1984.

=== Montana legislature ===
Rehberg was elected then to the Montana State House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991, where he served three terms. In the legislature, he considered himself to be a fiscal conservative, and he advocated balancing the state budget without any tax increases. He was the only freshman member to serve on the House Appropriations Committee.

=== Lieutenant governor ===
In July 1991, Rehberg was appointed lieutenant governor by Governor Stan Stephens. He was subsequently elected to a full term in 1992.

As lieutenant governor, Rehberg sought to bring government back to the local level by traveling to all 56 counties every year. He chaired the Drought Advisory Committee and the Task Force credited with reforming Worker&#x27;s Compensation, the Montana Rural Development Council, and several health care initiatives. Rehberg stepped down from his post to run for U.S. Senate. He was succeeded as lieutenant governor by fellow Republican Judy Martz.

=== 1996 U.S. Senate election ===

He ran for a seat in the United States Senate against incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Max Baucus, but lost, 50%–45%.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
;2000

Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Rick Hill of Montana&#x27;s at-large congressional district decided to retire after two terms in 2000. Rehberg decided to run and won the Republican primary with 74% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Democratic State School Superintendent Nancy Keenan 52%–46%.

;2002

He won re-election to a second term with 65%, against Steven Dickman Kelly.

;2004

He won re-election against Tracy Velazquez to a third term with 64%.

;2006

He won re-election to a fourth term against Democratic state representative Monica Lindeen 59%–39%.

;2008

He won re-election to a fifth term against Democratic state representative John Driscoll 64%–32%.

;2010

He won re-election to a sixth term against Democrat Dennis McDonald 60%–33%.

=== Tenure ===
;National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act (H.R. 1505)
In 2012 Rehberg co-sponsored H.R. 1505, which would waive environmental laws that would otherwise prevent the Department of Homeland Security from constructing roads, fences, and forward operating bases in national parks and wilderness areas within 100 miles of the international border. Homeland Security would not have to inform affected parties before pursuing these activities. The bill&#x27;s dissenters claim that it &quot;employs a manufactured conflict with border security to weaken [environmental laws].&quot; The Department of Homeland Security called the bill &quot;unnecessary and bad policy&quot; since DHS already has a memorandum of understanding allowing them to enter these lands without prior approval.

;Economic record
On April 15, 2011, Rehberg was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against The Path to Prosperity.

;Pell grants and school lunches
After having scrutinized the Pell Grant program as one that was &#x27;expanding&#x27; too quickly, congressman Rehberg set his sights on the free school lunch program as a program where there was potential of taxpayers being ripped off, although the state Superintendent of Public Instruction Denise Juneau expressed the real concern that not enough families that qualify request the assistance.

;Iraq War
Rehberg voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.

Rehberg served on the Military Quality of Life and Foreign Operations Subcommittees of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations. In 2007, he voted against the Mandatory Troop Rest Periods between Deployments to Iraq bill (creates a mandatory rest period between deployments to Iraq for members of the Armed Forces, passed) and against the Redeployment from Iraq Act (reduces the presence of the U.S. armed forces in Iraq by April 1, 2008, passed).

;Environmental record
Rehberg describes himself as &quot;a lifelong steward of the land&quot;. He voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007 and against the Securing America&#x27;s Future Energy (SAFE) Act of 2001. He is currently one of the foremost critics on keeping the gray wolf on the endangered species list.
On environmental issues, Rehberg has also been given low ratings by interest groups. Environment America gave him an 8% rating in 2008, and 27% rating in 2009. Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund gave him a 13% rating. In his position statement on Economic Development, he said &quot;Our [Montana&#x27;s] coal and natural gas reserves stretch for hundreds of years into the future, and we can turn them into much needed energy.&quot; 
Dennis Rehberg states opposition to the Shays-Meehan bill from 1998, of which he says it &quot;stripped freedom of speech rights from Montana citizens.&quot; Aside from the bill, he makes a point to say he supports full and open disclosure laws for campaign finance reform.

;LGBT issues
Rehberg opposes same-sex marriage, and supports a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, a bill that amends the Federal definition of a hate crime to include gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill passed, 237 to 180. In the December 26, 1994, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, p. 83, then lieutenant governor Rehberg was quoted as saying, &quot;The problem with AIDS is: you got it, you die. So why are we spending money on the issue?&quot; when discussing cuts to the state&#x27;s hospital budget.

== 2012 U.S. Senate election ==
On February 6, 2011, Rehberg announced that he would challenge Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) in 2012. The outcome of the race was expected to have a significant impact on which party controlled the United States Senate during the 113th Congress.

According to &quot;Salon&quot;, it was a &quot;race that pundits are saying could be a tough challenge for Tester.&quot; Political scientist Larry Sabato predicted a narrow Rehberg victory, pointing out that Rehberg had led in 10 of 13 recent polls. However, Tester eventually defeated Rehberg, 48.7%–44.8%.

=== 2014 U.S. House election ===
When after one term in the U.S. House Steve Daines ran for the U.S. Senate, Rehberg considered running for his old House seat, but ultimately declined. The seat was ultimately won by Republican Ryan Zinke.

=== 2024 U.S. House election ===
Rehberg ran in 2024 in the primary for Montana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which was held by Representative Matt Rosendale. Rehberg was criticized by foreign policy experts and human rights activists over the fact that he previously lobbied as a registered foreign agent at the firm Mercury Public Affairs for Hikvision, a Chinese state-owned video surveillance company that was sanctioned by the U.S. government for aiding China&#x27;s government in the detainment and surveillance of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China 

Rehberg lobbied for Hikvision against U.S. sanctions while working at Mercury, though claimed to the Washington Examiner in May 2024 that he &quot;has no knowledge or idea of what happened” in China with Hikvision, seeking to distance himself from the company&#x27;s activities. Rushan Abbas, a Uyghur American activist and advocate from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China, said it&#x27;s “extremely disappointing” Rehberg prioritized “profit from China’s blood money over human rights and human dignity.&quot;

“Unless he denounces or publicly apologizes for what he did, he should not be elected to represent the American people,” Rushan Abbas told the Washington Examiner.

== Personal life ==
Rehberg married his high school sweetheart, Jan, a water attorney who represents farmers and ranchers. They have been married for over 25 years and have three children, A.J., Katie, and Elsie. He is an Episcopalian.

=== Wealth ===
With a net worth of between $6.5 and $54 million, Rehberg was the fourteenth-richest U.S. Representative in the House in 2008. In an April 2011 town hall meeting video released by the Montana Democratic Party, he told an audience member that he was &quot;land-rich and cash-poor&quot; and &quot;struggling like everyone else.&quot;

=== Boating crash ===

On the night of Thursday, August 27, 2009, while in the area for a series of town hall forums on healthcare, Rehberg was a passenger in a boating accident near Bigfork, Montana on Flathead Lake. Montana State Senate Majority Whip Greg Barkus was driving the boat.

Rehberg, Barkus and his wife Kathy, and two Rehberg aides, Dustin Frost and Kristin Smith, were hospitalized in Kalispell following the accident, which took place sometime between 10pm and midnight. Frost, Rehberg&#x27;s then 27-year-old state director in Montana, suffered a brain injury. Frost was in a coma for more than a week.
Rehberg sustained a broken ankle and rib fractures.

Law enforcement agents investigated the cause of the accident, including &quot;how fast the boat was going, who was driving, and &#x27;whether alcohol and drugs were involved.&#x27;&quot; Barkus &quot;was found to have a blood alcohol content of .16 two hours after the accident. Despite the fact that, according to a witness quoted in the criminal complaint, Barkus had been drinking scotch and wine at a lakeside restaurant that night, Rehberg later said he &#x27;was surprised to learn the results of Greg&#x27;s blood alcohol test&#x27;.&quot; Rehberg released his BAC, measured several hours after the crash, at an alleged 0.05 percent.

Barkus, who had other driving violations and previously had plea bargained a DUI case down, ultimately pleaded no contest to a felony criminal endangerment charge. He was given a four-year deferred sentence, probation, paid $4,000 in restitution and a $25,000 fine.

=== Lawsuit against the City of Billings ===
In July 2010, Rehberg&#x27;s corporation that has developed a subdivision on his former ranch land sued the City of Billings for calling back firefighters from protecting trees and some scrub brush. The City of Billings had recently annexed a significant amount of undeveloped grass-land, including Rehberg&#x27;s ranch, and had not developed a firefighting policy for wildfires, which are significantly different from structure fires. When the fire flared again, the city firefighters had to return to put out the fire after significant damage was done. While the suit was filed in July, Rehberg and his wife did not push forward with litigation, given the political pressures of the 2010 Congressional campaign.

The city of Billings spent nearly $21,000 defending itself against the lawsuit before it was dropped by Rehberg.

<doc id="468541" wikidata="Q949897" url="?curid=468541" title="Dog Soldiers">
<text>The Dog Soldiers or Dog Men (Cheyenne: Hotamétaneo&#x27;o) are historically one of six Cheyenne military societies. Beginning in the late 1830s, this society evolved into a separate, militaristic band that played a dominant role in Cheyenne resistance to the westward expansion of the United States in the area of present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming, where the Cheyenne had settled in the early nineteenth century.

After nearly half the Southern Cheyenne died in the cholera epidemic of 1849, many of the remaining &quot;Masikota&quot; band joined the Dog Soldiers. It effectively became a separate band, occupying territory between the Northern and Southern Cheyenne. Its members often opposed policies of peace chiefs such as Black Kettle. In 1869 United States Army forces killed most of the band in the Battle of Summit Springs in Colorado Territory. The surviving Cheyenne societies became much smaller and more secretive in their operations.

The twenty-first century has seen a revival of the Dog Soldiers society in such areas as the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana and among the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma.

== Cheyenne tribal governance ==
The two central institutions of traditional Cheyenne tribal governance are the Council of Forty-Four and the military societies, the Dog Soldiers. The Council of Forty-Four is the council of chiefs, comprising four chiefs from each of the ten Cheyenne bands, plus four principal or &quot;Old Man&quot; chiefs, known to have had previously served with distinction on the council. While chiefs are responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of warrior societies are charged with maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership.

===Dog Soldiers===
Historically, Dog Soldiers have been regarded as both highly aggressive and effective combatants. One tradition recalls that in battle, they would &quot;pin&quot; themselves to a &quot;chosen&quot; piece of ground, through an unusually long breech-clout &quot;rear-apron&quot;, by use of one of three &quot;Sacred Arrows&quot; that they traditionally carried into battle.

== Emergence as a separate band ==

===Porcupine Bear===
Prior to the peace council held at Bent&#x27;s Fort in 1840, the Algonquian-speaking Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho were allied against their traditional enemies, the Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache, who belonged to different language families and cultures. In 1837, while raiding the Kiowa horse herds along the North Fork of the Red River, a party of 48 Cheyenne Bowstring Men were discovered and killed by Kiowa and Comanche warriors. Porcupine Bear, chief of the Dog Soldiers, took up the war pipe of the Cheyenne. He carried it to the various Cheyenne and Arapaho camps in order to gain support for revenge against the Kiowa. He reached a Northern Cheyenne camp along the South Platte River just after it had traded for liquor from American Fur Company at Fort Laramie.

Porcupine Bear joined in the drinking. He sat and sang Dog Soldier war songs. Two of his cousins, Little Creek and Around, became caught up in a drunken fight. Little Creek got on top of Around and held up a knife, ready to stab Around; at that point, Porcupine Bear, aroused by Around&#x27;s calls for help, tore the knife away from Little Creek, and stabbed him with it several times. He forced Around to finish off Little Creek.

By the rules governing military societies, a man who murdered or accidentally killed another member of his tribe had blood on his hands and was prohibited from joining a society. A society&#x27;s member who committed such a crime was expelled and outlawed. Porcupine Bear was expelled from the Dog Soldiers, and he and his relatives had to camp apart from the rest of the Cheyenne. The Dog Soldiers were disgraced by Porcupine Bear&#x27;s act. The other chiefs forbade them from leading war against the Kiowa.

Wolf reformed the Bowstring Society, which had been nearly annihilated in the fight with the Kiowa. It took over leading warfare against the Kiowa. Although outlawed by the main body of the Cheyenne, Porcupine Bear led the Dog Soldiers into battle against the Kiowa and Comanche at Wolf Creek. He and his warriors were reportedly the first to strike the enemy, considered an honor, but due to their status as outlaws, their feat was not celebrated.

===Dog Soldier band===
The outlawing of Porcupine Bear, his relatives, and his followers led to the transformation of the Dog Soldiers from a warrior society into a separate division of the tribe. In the wake of the cholera epidemic in 1849, which greatly reduced the &quot;Masikota&quot; band of Cheyenne, the remaining &quot;Masikota&quot; joined the Dog Soldiers.

When the Cheyenne bands camped together, the Dog Soldier band took the position in the camp circle formerly occupied by the &quot;Masikota&quot;. Prominent or ambitious warriors from other bands also gradually joined the Dog Soldier band. Over time, the Dog Soldiers took a prominent leadership role in the wars against the whites. The rest of the tribe began to regard them with respect and no longer as outlaws.

The Dog Soldiers contributed to the breakdown of the traditional matrilineal clan system of the Cheyennes. Customarily when a man married, he moved to the camp of his wife&#x27;s band. Maintaining their separation, the Dog Soldiers brought all wives to their own camp. Other elements contributing to the breakdown of the traditional clan system were the high rate of deaths from the 1849 cholera epidemic, which killed perhaps half the Southern Cheyenne population, particularly devastating the &quot;Masikota&quot; band and nearly wiping out the &quot;Oktoguna&quot;. Losses in the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 further disrupted the traditional Cheyenne kinship system. The Third Colorado Cavalry caused heavy casualties among the &quot;Wutapai&quot; (Black Kettle&#x27;s band); and killed perhaps half of the &quot;Hevhaitaniu&quot; under Yellow Wolf and Big Man, and half the &quot;Oivimana&quot; under War Bonnet. They also killed many among the &quot;Hisiometanio&quot; (Ridge Men) under White Antelope. The Dog Soldiers and the &quot;Masikota&quot;, who by that time operated as a band, were not at Sand Creek during the massacre.

The Dog Soldiers band took as its territory the headwaters country of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeast of Colorado Territory. They were allies of the Sioux-speaking Lakota and Brulé Lakota, who also frequented that area. The Cheyenne began to intermarry with the Lakota in that territory. Many Dog Soldiers were half-Lakota, including their leader Tall Bull. During the mid-1860s, Dog Soldier leaders, including Tall Bull and White Horse, frequently called on the great warrior Roman Nose, a Crooked Lance society member, to lead Dog Soldier strikes against white civilian and military assets. He led an attack on Fort Wallace in June 1867.

Due to an increasing division between the Dog Soldiers and the council chiefs with respect to policy toward the whites, the Dog Soldiers became separated from the other Southern Cheyenne bands. They effectively became a third division of the Cheyenne people, between the Northern Cheyenne, who ranged north of the Platte River, and the Southern Cheyenne, who occupied the area north of the Arkansas River.

A strong band numbering perhaps 100 lodges, the Dog Soldiers were hostile to the encroaching whites. By the 1860s, as conflict between Indigenous people and whites intensified, the militaristic Dog Soldiers increased their influence, together with that of the warrior societies of other Cheyenne bands. The warriors became a significant counter-influence to the leadership of the traditional Council of Forty-Four chiefs, who were likely to favor working for peace with the whites.

== Indian wars ==
In the late 1860s, the Dog Soldiers were crucial in Cheyenne resistance to the expansion into their territory. Dog Soldiers refused to sign treaties that limited their hunting grounds and restricted them to a reservation south of the Arkansas River. They attempted to hold their traditional lands at Smoky Hill, but the campaigns of General Philip Sheridan foiled these efforts. After the Battle of Beecher&#x27;s Island, many Dog Soldiers were forced to retreat south of the Arkansas River.

In the spring of 1867 they returned north with the intention of joining Red Cloud and his Oglala band in Powder River. Attacked by General Eugene Carr, the Dog Soldiers began raiding settlements on Smoky Hill River in revenge. Eventually, Chief Tall Bull led them west into Colorado. After raiding sites in Kansas, they were attacked by a force composed of Pawnee Scouts led by Major Frank North, and United States cavalry, who killed 23 of an estimated 450 Cheyenne warriors (5%), including Tall Bull, in the Battle of Summit Springs in June 1869.

<text>Loutraki () is a seaside resort on the Gulf of Corinth, in Corinthia, Greece. It is located west of Athens and northeast of Corinth. Loutraki is the seat of the municipality Loutraki-Perachora-Agioi Theodoroi. The town is known for its vast natural springs and its therapeutic spas. There are many tourists who visit Loutraki every year (especially in summer) because of its crystal clear sea. The Casino of Loutraki has thousands of visitors every day. The population in 2011 was 11,654 people.

==History==
In antiquity a town called Thermae (, hot springs) existed on the site. In 1847, an announcement in Italy asserting the therapeutic benefits of bathing in the natural thermal spas found in Loutraki caused an influx of settlers in the surrounding areas, thereby creating modern Loutraki. In 1928, Loutraki was completely destroyed by an earthquake, and rebuilt. A large park was created by claiming land from the sea, using the rubble of the fallen houses. Another strong earthquake hit the area in 1981 but with less destructive effects.

==Name==
The name &quot;Loutraki&quot; is a direct reference to the thermal spas of the region. It derives from the &quot;Loutro(n)&quot; () that means bath, bath-house, spa or thermae. The Greek word loutro is directly translated as thermae in English, which was also the ancient name of the region.

==Geography==
The town is bordered by the Gulf of Corinth in the west, while the mountain range of Geraneia dominates north and east. There is a small valley in the southwest that leads to the Isthmus of Corinth. Although part of Corinthia Prefecture, Loutraki is situated northwest of the Corinth Canal thus not on the Peloponnese.

==Sightseeing==
A monastery named Osios Patapios is located about NW of Loutraki on Geraneia mountain, offering great view of the Isthmos area and the Gulf of Corinth.

Loutraki is well known for its Casino (Club Hotel Casino Loutraki), one of the biggest in Europe.
The Heraion of Perachora (sanctuary of the goddess Hera) is an archaeological site of great significance located at the end of the Perachora peninsula and for the Vouliagmeni lake.

Visitors and tourists can visit several buildings of Loutraki. 
* On G. Lekkas str. there is a two-story house, built in 1928, which bears the hallmarks of his era (single volume and form a solid banister, exciting door). It holds a position in the urban fabric of the region and is an interesting group with other buildings of the street.
* Also on G. Lekkas str. is the landmark building of the hotel &quot;Palace&quot;, built in 1923 and owned by the George K. Aggelidis Hotel Company SA. This five-storey hotel was repaired in 1928 after an earthquake. The vertical axis of symmetry is predominant. Two marble staircases face each other, passing under the arched openings. The last two floors are unified, with the central part protruding from the building and raised at the end. The decorations are linear. The bearing structure consists of masonry, blocks, reinforced concrete.
* One of the old villas of the old town of Loutraki is on Syros str., with an area of 135 sq.m., which was built in 1956 on the site of a pre-1950 house. The bearing structure consists of reinforced concrete. The purchase and renovation was the work of the Cypriot industrialist distiller Kekkos Ioannidis, when he came to Greece from the Congo of Africa. It bears the hallmarks of his era (simple volume and format, high ceilings, mosaics, solid gate and door), has large terraces, and is surrounded by gardens with fruit trees and roses, the latter of which dominate a fountain garden. Today is in the hands of another owner, who erected in the garden a bronze bust of General George V. Papagiannopoulos, who was wounded in the war.

<text>Genting Highlands is a hill station located on the peak of Mount Ulu Kali in the Titiwangsa Mountains, central Peninsular Malaysia, at 1800 metres elevation. Located in the state of Pahang, it was established in 1965 by the late Malaysian businessman Lim Goh Tong. The primary tourist attraction is Resorts World Genting, a hill resort where casinos and theme parks are situated and where gambling is permitted. Many of Pahang&#x27;s skyscrapers can be found here.

==History==

The idea to build a hill resort near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur came from Malaysian businessman, Lim Goh Tong who was inspired by the fresh air in Cameron Highlands during his business trip there in 1963 for a hydroelectric power project. The rationale was that Cameron Highlands was too far away from Kuala Lumpur, and therefore building a mountain resort nearer to Kuala Lumpur would have excellent business potential. After researching Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s maps and surrounding areas, Lim identified Mount Ulu Kali in Genting Sempah, 58 km from Kuala Lumpur, to be ideal for his plan. He set up a private company called Genting Highlands Berhad (now Genting Group) on 27 April 1965 with the politician Mohamad Noah Omar and successfully obtained approval for the alienation of and of land from the Pahang and Selangor State Government respectively between 1965 and 1970.

On 18 August 1965, a technical and construction team began to construct the access road from Genting Sempah to the peak of Mount Ulu Kali. On 31 March 1969, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&#x27;s first prime minister, laid the foundation stone for the company&#x27;s pioneer hotel, marking the completion of the access road to Genting Highlands Resort. The resort was also granted the casino license the same year by the Malaysian government to develop its gambling industry. An area midway to the peak was turned into the Gohtong Jaya township. In 1971, the first hotel at Genting Highlands was completed and was named Highlands Hotel (now renamed Theme Park Hotel).

Since then, Genting Highlands Resort has expanded, with six more hotels being built within 2017. They are Genting Hotel (renamed Genting Grand, 1981), Awana (1984), Resort Hotel (1992), Highlands Hotel (1997), First World Hotel (2001), and Crockfords (2017). Two cable car systems were built to provide transport to the hilltop: Awana Skyway built in 1977 with a length of and Genting Skyway cable car system built in 1997 with a length of . The resort ventured into the amusement park and entertainment industry by launching the Genting Grand Indoor Theme Park in 1992, Genting Outdoor Theme Park in 1994, Arena of Stars in 1998 and First World Plaza Indoor Theme Park in 2001.

In 2013, Genting Group implemented a 10-year master plan named Genting Integrated Tourism Plan (GITP) to develop, expand, enhance and refurbish hotels, theme parks, and infrastructure at Genting Highlands. The project with different phases involves a new 1,300 rooms hotel expansion to the current First World Hotel, a new 10,000 seats arena, renovation of the First World Plaza Indoor Theme Park, and reconverting the Genting Outdoor Theme Park to 20th Century Fox World. A dispute with 20th Century Fox, which was purchased by The Walt Disney Company, resulted in the theme park being rebranded as Genting SkyWorlds. In 2019, the refurbishment of the infrastructure at the resort was completed, with the outdoor theme park being fully renovated in 2021. As of 2024, there are no further plans to renovate both the indoor and outdoor theme parks.

==Climate==
Genting Highlands has a springlike subtropical highland climate (Cfb), with yearly temperatures no higher than and rarely falling below yearly.

==Attractions==

===Resorts World Genting===

Resorts World Genting (Abbreviation: RWG), originally known as Genting Highlands Resort, is an integrated hill resort owned by Genting Group through subsidiary Genting Malaysia Berhad which comprises hotels, shopping malls, theme parks and casinos. It is the main attraction of the hill station, located within the Pahang section of the area.

====Accommodations====
Resorts World Genting has seven hotels, with one of them being a leisure resort. One of the seven accommodations, First World Hotel, held the Guinness World Record as the largest hotel globally from 2006 until 2008 and regained the title in 2015 with 7,351 rooms following Tower 2A. In 2018, Forbes Travel Guide Star Ratings awarded 4-star rating and &#x27;recommended&#x27; citation to Genting Grand and Maxims respectively.

Crockfords at Resorts World Genting was awarded the 5-star rating in 2019 and 2020, making it the first and only hotel in Malaysia to achieve this award.

====Theme parks====
There are currently three theme parks at Resort World Genting, Genting SkyWorlds (formerly Genting Outdoor Theme Park), Skytropolis Funland (formerly First World Plaza Indoor Theme Park) and Genting Grand Indoor Theme Park. Genting Outdoor Theme Park was opened in 1994 with 31 rides at its peak, including a monorail service. It was closed on 1 September 2013 to make way for the construction of world&#x27;s first 20th Century Fox World. However, due to disputes between Genting Malaysia Berhad, Fox Entertainment Group and The Walt Disney Company over the theme park after the purchase of 20th Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Genting and Walt Disney filed civil suits over each other. On 26 July 2019, following an agreement between Disney and Fox which granted Genting Malaysia Berhad a license to utilise certain Fox intellectual properties, the theme park was eventually rebranded as Genting SkyWorlds. Genting Skyworlds was planned to open in June 2021 after completion was delayed from 2016 to 2018 and then to 2020. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, construction work had to be closed down and the opening date was postponed, although works have been mostly completed. On February 8, 2022, Genting SkyWorlds began to hold soft openings.

First World Plaza Indoor Theme Park was opened in 2001 with 12 rides at its peak and was closed from June 2017 to February 2018 for refurbishment. On 8 December 2018, it was opened to the public and rebranded as Skytropolis Indoor Theme Park, with some attractions mimicking older attractions of the former indoor and outdoor theme parks. The theme park also included the first Asian branch of VOID, a US-based operator of unique fully immersive virtual reality attraction, which officially opened on 6 December 2018 on a section of Skytropolis Indoor Theme Park.

On 14 June 2024, a fire broke out at the Genting SkyWorlds. More than 5,000 people evacuated to safer locations and yet there were no casualties. The fire started at the second floor before spreading to the fourth floor.

Genting Grand Indoor Theme Park was opened in 1992, located at the lower floor of Genting Grand Hotel and consists of two children rides and one amusement arcade – Vision City Video Games Park.

====Casino====
Resorts World Genting is the only legal land-based casino area in the country. SkyCasino located in SkyAvenue Mall is the only casino that remains in operation in Malaysia. The much older, Genting Casino, was temporarily closed in early 2024 to facilitate renovations and upgrading works. 

====Shopping Malls====
There are currently five shopping malls at the resort, Awana Sky Central, First World Plaza, Genting Highlands Premium Outlets, SkyAvenue, and Genting Grand Complex. Two shopping malls, Awana SkyCentral and Genting Highlands Premium Outlet, is near Gohtong Jaya and are connected by two link bridges. The three remaining malls are situated at the mountain top.

====Zouk Genting====
In 2015, Genting Hong Kong Limited, a part of the Genting Group, purchased the Singaporean nightlife brand Zouk. At this time, Zouk already had a second outlet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In 2019, Zouk opened its third outlet in Resorts World Genting. This Genting outlet of Zouk features the main Empire Nightclub, FUHU Dining (a Chinese-themed restaurant), and RedTail Bar (consisting of a games bar, a sports bar and a karaoke section).

Zouk continued its close collaboration with the Resorts World brand by subsequently opening another outlet inside Resorts World Las Vegas in 2022.

<text>Siemowit (Polish pronunciation: [ɕɛˈmɔvit], also Ziemowit [ʑɛˈmɔvit]) was, according to the chronicles of Gallus Anonymus, the son of Piast the Wheelwright and Rzepicha. He is considered to be the first ruler of the Piast dynasty.

He became the Duke of the Polans in the 9th century after his father, Piast the Wheelwright, son of Chościsko, refused to take the place of legendary Duke Popiel. Siemowit was elected as new duke by the &quot;wiec&quot;. According to a popular legend, Popiel was then eaten by mice in his tower on Gopło lake.

The only mention of Siemowit, along with his son, Lestek, and grandson, Siemomysł, comes in the medieval chronicle of Gallus Anonymus.

Siemowit&#x27;s great-grandson, Mieszko I, was the first Christian ruler of Poland.

<doc id="468550" wikidata="Q161273" url="?curid=468550" title="Anglicism">
<text>An anglicism is a word or construction borrowed from English by another language. Due to the global dominance of English in the 20th and 21st centuries, many English terms have become widespread in other languages. Technology-related English words like &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;computer&quot; are prevalent across the globe, as there are no pre-existing words for them. English words are sometimes imported verbatim and sometimes adapted to the importing language in a process similar to anglicisation. In languages with non-Latin alphabets, these borrowed words can be written in the Latin alphabet anyway, resulting in a text made up of a mixture of scripts; other times they are transliterated. Transliteration of English and other foreign words into Japanese generally uses the katakana script.

In some countries, such anglicisation is seen as relatively benign, and the use of English words may even take on a &quot;chic&quot; aspect; in Japan, marketing products for the domestic market often involves using English or pseudo-English brand names and slogans. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend. It is also important to note that while the word &quot;anglicism&quot; is rooted in the word English, the process does not necessarily denote anglicisms from England. It can also involve terms or words from all varieties of English so that it becomes necessary to use the term Americanism for the loan words originating from the United States.

== Definitions ==

Definitions of anglicism differ significantly across various fields. The word is employed in various situations of language contact.

The criteria for being considered an anglicism by the &quot;Usage Dictionary of Anglicisms in Selected European Languages&quot; are as follows: a loanword that is recognisably English in form with regards to spelling, pronunciation and morphology. In this specific sense, loan translations and calques are excluded (as well as words that are etymologically derived from languages related to modern French).

Some see anglicisms as harmless and useful, others perceive them as bad influences to be countered.

Other definitions of anglicism include: a word or construction peculiar to English; a word or phrase that is peculiar to British English; or English syntax, grammar, or meaning transposed in another language resulting in incorrect language use or incorrect translation.

== Adaptation ==
A number of scholars agree that for anglicism to take place, adaptation must first occur such as in the case of the integration of a great number of anglicisms in Europe. Fischer said that it is similar to neologism in the sense that it completes several phases of integration, which include: 1) the beginning, when it is still new and not known to many speakers; 2) the phase where it begins to spread and take part in the process of institutionalisation; and, 3) the word becomes part of the common core of the language. There are experts who propose a more detailed framework such as the model of anglicism adaptation that transpires on four levels: orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic.

== By language ==
===Chinese===
These are English terms, expressions, or concepts that have been absorbed into the Chinese language, including any of its varieties, and should not be confused with Chinglish, the variety of the English language used by native Chinese speakers.

The origins of Chinese anglicisms vary, one of the most common being those obtained by phonetic borrowing. For example, a &quot;&quot; (, in Mainland China or Taiwan) is usually called in Hong Kong and Macao because its Cantonese pronunciation is similar to its English counterpart. Another type of anglicism is syntactic anglicism, when a sentence is rendered following the English word order instead of the standard Chinese word order; for example, the word for &quot;&quot; is or , where can be translated as &quot;net&quot;.
===Finnish===
The anglicisms can be divided to four types: direct phonetic imitation, lexical and grammatical calques, and contamination of orthography. Official language (as given by the Language Planning Office) deprecates Anglicisms, and for the most part, native constructions are sufficient even in spoken language. Nevertheless, some anglicisms creep in.

Computer jargon is generally full of direct imitation, e.g. &quot;swap&quot;. Other jargons with abundant anglicisms are pop music, scifi, gaming, fashion, automobile and to some extent scientific jargon. This is regarded a sign of overspecialisation, if used outside the context of the jargon. Generally, direct imitation is not as common, but there are examples. For example, the word &quot;sexy&quot; , pronounced with an Y unlike in English , might be used as an adjective. This is teenager-specific.

Lexical calques take an English expression, like &quot;killer application&quot;, and produce , which does mean &quot;an application that kills&quot; just as in English. Readers need to know the equivalent English term to understand this.

Some speakers, especially those in frequent contact with the English language, have created a grammatical calque of the English &quot;you&quot;-impersonal. The English impersonal utilises the second person pronoun &quot;you&quot;, e.g. &quot;You can&#x27;t live if you don&#x27;t eat&quot;. Here, the word &quot;you&quot; does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as , where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as ) is used. When translated word-by-word, , it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction of spoken language is used instead of the of spoken language. Then, &quot;you&quot; will need to understand that it is an anglicism, or &quot;you&quot; can be offended by the commanding &quot;You there!&quot; tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.)

An English orthographical convention is that compound words are written separately, whereas in Finnish, compound words are written together, using a hyphen with acronyms and numbers. In Finnish, and would be correct, but &quot;process engineering&quot; or &quot;Intel 80286 processor&quot; would not. Failure to join the words or omitting the hyphen can be either an honest mistake, or contamination from English.

Another orthographical convention is that English words tend to be written as the originals. For example, the computer jargon term from &quot;to chat&quot; is written as (chat + frequentative), even if it is pronounced . The forms or are used, too. Sometimes, it is even standard language, e.g. , instead of according to English pronunciation .

===French===
A distinction is made between well-established English borrowings into French, and other words and structures regarded as incorrect. The term is often pejorative, carries a large amount of political weight, and frequently denotes an excessive use of English in the French language.

French has many words of English origin for which the English roots are unknown or unrecognised due to a lack of salience or the length of time since the borrowing took place; this also includes other words which are seen as English but that are well accepted as part of French (e.g., &quot;parking&quot;, &quot;week-end&quot;). Other examples include (pronounced ), (meaning &quot;public square&quot;), and (meaning &quot;melancholy&quot; rather than the organ). These are not considered anglicisms but are fully accepted as French words by the .

Occasionally governments and linguistic institutions of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec have been met with some success (e.g., for ), attempts by the Académie have largely been unsuccessful. Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm. The Académie regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (e.g., for ).

Replacements have taken many different forms. For example, in Quebec French, the portmanteau word is increasingly gaining acceptance. This neologism is a word coined from the words (&quot;keyboard&quot;) and (&quot;chat&quot;). Other replacements have various forms created by the Académie and .

Quebec French and Metropolitan French tend to have entirely different anglicisms for historical reasons. Quebec French acquired its anglicisms in a gradual process of linguistic borrowing resulting from linguistic contact with English speakers for the roughly 250 years since the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of 1759. Metropolitan French, on the other hand, mostly adopted its anglicisms in recent decades due to the post-Second World War international dominance of English, or the rise of English as a lingua franca. Due to the differences in English borrowings between Canada and France, the people of Quebec and France often consider each other&#x27;s anglicisms to be incorrect or humorous, while considering their own to be perfectly normal.

An example of a Metropolitan French anglicism not used in Quebec French:
* : short for , but pronounced like the English word &quot;sweet&quot;

An example of a Quebec French anglicism not used in France;
* : to French kiss

The social meaning and acceptance of anglicisms also differs from country to country due to the differences in the historical relationship to French. In Quebec, anglicisms are never used in formal documentation (government papers, instruction sheets) and very rarely used in informal writing (magazines, journals). In 1993, the French passed the legislation Loi Toubon which forbids the use of anglicisms (or those from other languages) in commercial and government publications. In both countries, wherever the use of an anglicism is unavoidable, it is often written in italics or in quotations.

Various anglicisms are largely differentiated on the way in which they entered the language. One type of anglicism is a calque, or a direct translation from English. For example, the valediction is regarded as an anglicism, since it is a direct translation of the English &quot;sincerely yours&quot;. Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of English terms such as &quot;business&quot; or &quot;start-up&quot;. Additionally, some English words in French might not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word &quot;golf&quot;, which has an increased semantic field, referring not just to the game of golf, but also to a golf course, as in (trans: &quot;we&#x27;re going to the golf course&quot;).

Anglicism is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb &quot;to flirt&quot; cites influence from the Old French expression , which means &quot;to (try to) seduce&quot;. Other possible origins for the word include , E. Frisian (a flick or light stroke), and E. Frisian (a giddy girl). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English Gallicism &quot;to flirt&quot; has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.

===German===

Denglisch is a pejorative term used in German describing the increased use of anglicisms and pseudo-anglicisms in the German language. It is a portmanteau of the German words (&quot;German&quot;) and . The term is first recorded from 1965. To some extent, the influence of English on German can be from normal language contact. The term Denglisch is however mostly reserved for forced, excessive exercises in anglicisation, or pseudo-anglicisation, of the German language.

===Italian===

Under Benito Mussolini, efforts were made to purify Italian of anglicisms and other foreign words. A well-known example of anglicism used in Italian is &quot;guardrail&quot;, which has always been totally rooted in common usage, given that the Italian alternatives proposed in the last century such as: &quot;guardavia&quot;, &quot;sicurvia&quot;, &quot;guardastrada&quot; and the Helvetism &quot;guidovia&quot; have not met with any success, being little used. Today, Italian is one of the most receptive languages for anglicisms.

===Japanese===

Anglicised words in Japanese are altered to reflect the absence of certain phonemes in Japanese, such as &#x27;l&#x27; (changed to &#x27;r&#x27;) and &#x27;v&#x27; (changed to &#x27;b&#x27;). Other changes occur when, for example, an English word ending in &quot;l&quot; becomes &quot;ru&quot;. For example, &quot;hotel&quot; becomes , as in the expression (love hotel), the word is strictly speaking not an anglicism, coming from the French (with).

===Latvian===
The first anglicisms in the written sources of Latvian appear at the end of the 18th century, however, up until the middle 1970s they were barely researched as their number remained low and since they mostly appeared in the terminology of sports and engineering. The direct contact between Latvian and English at that time was very limited, thus most of the anglicisms entered Latvian through German or Russian. Ever since Latvia regained its independence, there has been an influx of anglicisms into the Latvian language due to the fact that media in English is more accessible than ever.

===Polish===

Sporadic linguistic contacts between Polish and English-speaking areas have been noted at least since the 15th century. However, most early anglicisms in Polish were mostly limited to names for places in Great Britain and the Americas. The first proper anglicisms were also related to geography and were recorded in an 18th-century work by Franciszek Siarczyński. By the end of that century there were at least 21 lexemes of English provenance in Polish usage. The 1859 dictionary of foreign words by Michał Amszejewicz contains roughly 100 anglicisms, the so-called Vilnian dictionary of 1861 contains roughly 180 of such words. The anglicisms recorded in the 19th century were in large part words related to social, political, legal and economic concepts used in English society and lacking corresponding institutions in contemporary Poland. Another group comprised naval, sports-related and technical terms.

Typically new words were initially being written in their original form, especially when they were used to describe English or American contexts. Such was the case of the word &quot;budget&quot;, first recorded as such in 1792 in relation to English economy, but soon also used in Polish context. With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as . Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by Samuel Linde includes the following anglicisms: (after London&#x27;s suburb of Vauxhall; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), , , , , , and .

The assimilation of new English words into Polish sped up in the 20th century and gradually English replaced Czech, German, French, Italian and other languages as the primary source of new imports into the Polish language. At the turn of the century there were roughly 250 English words in use, by 1961 the number of English lexemes in Polish rose to over 700, breaking 1000 lexemes in the 1980s and at least 1600 in 1994.

Borrowings from English language used in modern Polish fall into a number of thematic categories:
* Science and technology: , , , , , , (used as a generic word for personal stereo rather than a trademark);
* Sports and healthcare: aerobic, lifting, jogging, peeling, , , , , , , , jockey, , , , , , , , , , , ;
* Computers: , , (a semantic blueprint), , , ;
* Economy: , , , , , , , , , , , ;
* Fashion: , , , ;
* Politics: , 
* Daily life: , , , , , , , , , , , , ;
* Maritime terms: , , , , , ;
* Food: , , , , , , , , , 

Take note, that some of the borrowed words already have Polish equivalents and therefore are not recognised by all language users:
* (manager) instead of 
* (quad bike) instead of 
* (CCTV) instead of , 
* (English: How can I help you) instead of (English: How can I serve you).

In addition to lexical borrowings, there is also a number of calques in everyday use.

===Spanish===

Spanglish (a portmanteau of the words &quot;Spanish&quot; and &quot;English&quot;) is a name sometimes given to various contact dialects, pidgins, or creole languages that result from interaction between Spanish and English used by people who speak both languages or parts of both languages, mainly spoken in the United States. It is a blend of Spanish and English lexical items and grammar. Spanglish can be considered a variety of Spanish with heavy use of English or vice versa. It can be more related either to Spanish or to English, depending on the circumstances. Since Spanglish arises independently in each region, it reflects the locally spoken varieties of English and Spanish. In general different varieties of Spanglish are not necessarily mutually intelligible. In Mexican and Chicano Spanish the common term for &quot;Spanglish&quot; is &quot;Pocho&quot;.

===Urdu===
Urdish (a portmanteau of the words &quot;Urdu&quot; and &quot;English&quot;) is used, when referring to code-switching between the two languages (this also applies to other varieties of Hindustani, including Hindi). Standard Urdu includes a limited amount of anglicisms. However, many urban Urdu speakers tend to use many more anglicisms when code-switching in speech. In standard written Urdu, anglicisms and code-switching are not common.

Examples:
* (Standard Urdu: /

<doc id="468552" wikidata="Q6177769" url="?curid=468552" title="Jenna Morasca">
<text>Jenna Morasca (born February 15, 1981) is an American actress, former swimsuit model, professional wrestler and American reality TV contestant who was the million-dollar grand prize winner of &quot;&quot; in 2003. In 2009, she worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

In 2011, Morasca and her then-boyfriend, fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; winner Ethan Zohn, participated in the 19th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. They were one of the two teams eliminated in a double-elimination, finishing tenth for the season.

==Early life==
Jenna Morasca was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 15, 1981, to Carla and Michael Morasca. She is an only child. Before appearing on &quot;Survivor&quot;, Morasca was a college student at the University of Pittsburgh, where she was initiated into Zeta Tau Alpha.

Morasca graduated from South Fayette High School in 1999, and studied at Duquesne University for two years before transferring to University of Pittsburgh.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;The Amazon&quot;===

Morasca first competed on &quot;Survivor&quot; in the show&#x27;s sixth season, &quot;&quot;. Filmed in the Amazon Rainforest in 2002. The season&#x27;s tribes were split by gender so Morasca was initially placed on Jaburu (women&#x27;s tribe) alongside Deena Bennett, Jeanne Hebert, Janet Koth, Shawna Mitchell, Christy Smith, Heidi Strobel, and Joanna Ward, as its youngest member.

At the beginning of the game, Morasca formed a friendship with Strobel and Mitchell as they were the youngest women on the tribe. Despite her lack of work ethic rubbing some the wrong way, she survived the tribe&#x27;s two visits to tribal council.

A tribe switch resulted in Morasca, Bennett and Mitchell remaining on Jabaru, now accompanied by Alex Bell, Rob Cesternino, and Matthew von Ertfelda. The new tribe won the following challenge, but lost on day 18 where Mitchell was voted out for her closeness with Bell.

On day 19, the tribes merged into the Jacaré tribe. During the first immunity challenge, Morasca and fellow contestant Strobel stripped off their clothes for peanut butter and chocolate. Morasca&#x27;s alliance now with Bell, Cesternino and Strobel managed to control multiple votes, namely Roger Sexton, Dave Johnson, and Bennett. At the Final Seven, Cesternino betrayed his alliance by voting out Bell. At the Final Six, Morasca and Strobel scrambled to stay in the game, trying to break up the alliance of Cesternino, Matthew von Ertfelda and Butch Lockley. When Christy Smith would not commit to either side, Cesternino convinced Morasca and Strobel to help vote out Smith, who was later voted off. At the Final Five, Strobel was voted out, but Morasca won the next immunity, allowing her to advance to the Final Three. Morasca, Cesternino and von Ertfelda voted out Lockley. Morasca won the key final immunity challenge which gave her the sole power to eliminate either Cesternino or von Ertfelda and eventually eliminated Cesternino. Morasca beat von Ertfelda in a 6–1 vote to become the Sole Survivor. Morasca was the youngest contestant to ever win &quot;Survivor&quot; until Jud &quot;Fabio&quot; Birza won &quot;&quot; in 2010, though Morasca remains the youngest female contestant to win &quot;Survivor&quot;.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Morasca&#x27;s winning game got her cast on the show&#x27;s first all-star edition &quot;&quot;. Where she was sorted into the Mogo Mogo tribe alongside Colby Donaldson, Richard Hatch, Shii Ann Huang, Lex van den Berghe, and Kathy Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien.
Morasca was initially in little danger as her tribe won immunity in the first two episodes. In Episode Three, Morasca decided to quit the game, out of a desire to be with her dying mother, who had been battling cancer for 12 years, making her the third person eliminated from the competition. Her mother died eight days after Morasca returned home.

===&quot;Survivor Live&quot;===
In 2005, Morasca replaced Richard Hatch as co-host (with Dalton Ross) of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Survivor Live&quot;, an internet talk show devoted to the then-current season of &quot;Survivor&quot;. She has since hosted the show throughout five entire seasons - &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2012, Rob Cesternino held a pageant named &#x27;Miss Survivor&#x27;, where individuals could vote for their favorite female survivor. Morasca was in the running in 2012 alongside Andrea Boehlke, Amanda Kimmel, Parvati Shallow and Courtney Yates. She went on to lose to Shallow.

==Career==
Morasca worked as a swimsuit model. she works as a veterinary nurse.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009)===

Morasca made her professional wrestling debut on the March 12, 2009, episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; program, in a backstage interview with Mick Foley. She then appeared in backstage segments with Kevin Nash and his alliance The Main Event Mafia. It was later revealed by Kurt Angle that Morasca was the financial backer to the Mafia, and the money she provided was used to lure Samoa Joe to the stable, establishing Morasca as a heel in the process. Morasca was regularly seen bickering with fellow Mafia valet Sharmell, leading to a catfight backstage on the May 28 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

On the July 9 edition of &quot;Impact&quot; it was revealed that Morasca had hired Awesome Kong to train her for her upcoming match against Sharmell at Victory Road where she defeated Sharmell. The match was very poorly received, receiving the &quot;Worst Worked Match of the Year&quot; award for 2009 from readers of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. &quot;Figure Four Weekly&quot; Bryan Alvarez, reviewing Victory Road for &quot;The Bryan and Vinny Show&quot;, called it the worst women&#x27;s match he had ever seen. Giving it a minus 5-star rating, he said he was unable to remember the last time he had done so because it had been so long since he had seen a match that bad. Reviewing the match for WrestleCrap, &quot;Triple Kelly&quot; Kelly Parmalee called it &quot;the absolute worst wrestling match I have EVER seen in my life&quot; and compared it negatively to &quot;That Jackie Gayda Match&quot; from the July 8, 2002, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. This would be her only match in wrestling.

===Other television and film appearances===
In 2003, Morasca had a part in the Off Broadway play &quot;Pieces&quot;. In 2004, she was on the board of directors for Animal Friends in Pittsburgh. In 2005, she appeared in a minor role in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Scorned&quot;.

Morasca was a contestant on the February 28, 2005, episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, which starred former reality television contestants. She was eliminated in the second round by Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth.

In October 2006, she appeared in the premiere episode of &quot;Celebrity Paranormal Project&quot; on VH-1, along with other notables such as Gary Busey.

In 2011, Morasca and her then-boyfriend, fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; winner Ethan Zohn, participated in the 19th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. They checked-in at fourth place in the opening leg. In the second episode, which featured the show&#x27;s first ever double elimination, Morasca and Zohn arrived at the Pit Stop in ninth place, which would have just spared them from elimination; however, they had to return to the orphanage they visited in that leg to donate all of their money, which resulted in them dropping to tenth-place resulting in their elimination.

Morasca and Zohn also appeared together as guest sous chefs on the seventh episode of the first season of the Food Network show &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Stranded: Deserted Island: Impossible&quot;, and on the premiere of the fourth season of the &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, in which they supported their former &quot;Survivor&quot; castmate Richard Hatch.

In 2011, Morasca and Zohn also starred in &quot;The Watcher&quot;, a 20-minute horror movie included in the &quot;Drive-In Horror Show&quot; series,

===Modeling===
Morasca&#x27;s strip with fellow contestant Heidi Strobel led to a nude pictorial in the August 2003 &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

She also appeared near-nude in an anti-fur ad for PETA with her boyfriend, &quot;&quot; winner Ethan Zohn, that featured the slogan &quot;We&#x27;d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur!&quot;

Morasca modeled swimwear and was the CEO of a model scouting company called Model Challenge USA, which she founded in 2004.

==Personal life==
Morasca began dating fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; champion Ethan Zohn after her victory on &quot;&quot; in 2003. They lived in Manhattan, though not together. In an interview on &quot;Rob Has a Podcast&quot;, it was revealed that Morasca and Zohn were considered to return in &quot;&quot;, after applying for &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The couple declined the offer, saying they were not interested in competing against each other. In February 2013, Morasca and Zohn confirmed that they had amicably ended their relationship after ten years together.

On January 25, 2018, Morasca was arrested in Washington, Pennsylvania, and charged with driving under the influence and possession of narcotics paraphernalia. According to the police report, Morasca was unconscious while the vehicle was stopped at a stop sign, with the engine still running. The person sitting in the vehicle&#x27;s passenger seat was caught by police putting a plastic baggie with syringes in her purse. When paramedics arrived, they administered Naloxone to Morasca, who was physically combative throughout the process, biting a police officer&#x27;s arm after having been placed in an ambulance. In a January 2021 interview, Morasca commented on the reports of the incident, stating, &quot;Don&#x27;t believe everything you read.&quot; She later explicitly denied she was arrested or charged, writing on her Instagram, &quot;I&#x27;m doing great (and I&#x27;ve NEVER been arrested or got a DUI like a million websites like to say)! I had a tough go after my dad died suddenly, but I was able to get myself together and keep moving forward with the help of an incredible support system.&quot;

<doc id="468558" wikidata="Q2081953" url="?curid=468558" title="CodeView">
<text>CodeView is a standalone debugger created by David Norris at Microsoft in 1985 as part of its development toolset. It originally shipped with Microsoft C 4.0 and later. It also shipped with Visual Basic for MS-DOS, Microsoft BASIC PDS, and a number of other Microsoft language products. It was one of the first debuggers for MS-DOS to be full-screen oriented, rather than line-oriented (as Microsoft&#x27;s predecessors DEBUG and SYMDEB or Digital Research&#x27;s SID).

==Overview==
When running, CodeView presents the user with several windows that can be tiled, moved, sized and otherwise manipulated via the keyboard or mouse, with CodeView 4.x providing a richer interface. Some of the windows include:

* Code window – the code window showed the currently debugged code in its source code context.
* Data window – a hexadecimal dump of a user-specified memory area.
* Watch window – a contextual display of variables by name.
* Locals window – a contextual display of variables local to the current function.
* Command window – user commands (using the same or similar syntax as DEBUG and SYMDEB) could be entered here.
* Assembly window – the assembly (machine code) was displayed, allowing for single-stepping through functions.
* Register window – to visualize the 80x86 register contents, including segments, flags and the FPU (CodeView existed before MMX and other SIMD extensions).
* Output window – a window showing startup operations and debugging information relating to breakpoints, hardware breaks (interrupt 0 and 3), etc.

===Features===
* 386 mode – 8086, 80286 and 80386 and later processors. 386 enhanced mode is activated by a menu option, allowing for 32-bit registers and disassembly.
* Monochrome monitor support – allows debugging on either a single color (CGA, EGA or VGA) monitor with page/memory swapping between the user application and the CodeView screen, or using a separate monochrome monitor. The monochrome monitor exists in memory address space 0xb0000, while the color monitor exists at 0xb8000 for text and 0xa0000 for graphics. Use of the monochrome monitor with its separate memory address space allows debugging graphics applications without affecting the display, as well as all text modes. Monochrome monitors are limited to 25 lines, whereas color monitors allow 25, 43 or 50 line mode, allowing for more information on the screen at the same time.

Creating symbolic debugging output, which allows memory locations to be viewed by their programmer-assigned name, along with a program database showing the source code line related to every computer instruction in the binary executable, is enabled by the command line switch -Zi given to the compiler, and -CO given to the linker. Variants like -Zs and -Zd provide lesser information, and smaller output files which, during the early 1990s, were important due to limited machine resources, such as memory and hard disk capacity. Many systems in those days had 8MB of memory or less.

CodeView handles all program models, including TINY, SMALL, COMPACT, MEDIUM, LARGE and HUGE, with TINY (DOS-based .COM files) having their symbolic debugger information stored in a separate file, with all of the other .EXE formats containing the symbolic information directly inside the executable. This often introduced a notable size increase, and it therefore became desirable for some developers to use #pragma switches within their C (and later C++) source code to prevent the majority of the application from having symbolic output, and instead limiting that output to only those portions which required it for current debugging.

CodeView version 3.x and 4.x introduced various transport layers, which removed some of the memory space limitations to this form of symbolic debugging. Typically the debugger runs in the lower 640KB memory space alongside the application being debugged, which greatly decreases the amount of memory available to the application being debugged. The transport layer allows only a stub to exist in main memory, while the bulk of the debugger code resides in EMS or XMS (memory above the 1 MB barrier, or outside of the normal 0 KB - 640 KB address space typically used by DOS programs). CodeView also came with a CVPACK command-line utility, which can reduce the size of the CodeView-generated information internally, while still retaining full symbolic access to data.

==Visual C++ support==
Microsoft released Visual C++ 1.0 with CodeView functionality integrated directly into a single programming environment, known as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) -- though CodeView was still available in the 16-bit versions of Visual C++. QuickC and a number of other development tools in the &#x27;Quick&#x27; series also supported this move to a single-source IDE, what became the precursor to the modern Visual Studio developer environment, as well as the model for countless other developer toolsets.

This integration was seen by many developers as a more natural way of developing software because both coding and debugging could be handled without switching programs or context, and all from the same logical location (even though internally many separate programs were running to support editing, compiling and debugging). As a result, most development tools and/or platforms offer similar products or features. 

Today, the debugger is considered an integrated and essential part of the Microsoft Visual Studio family of products, and owes its true roots to CodeView, and the enhancements seen in version 4.x specifically.

==Symdeb==

Another debugging product available from Microsoft in the mid-1980s was &quot;SYMDEB&quot;.

It had over 30 commands, and was described by PC Magazine as a step up from DEBUG. Codeview in turn was described as &quot;a fullscreen SYMDEB&quot;.

<doc id="468570" wikidata="Q21272794" url="?curid=468570" title="Anamorphic widescreen">
<text>Anamorphic widescreen (also called full-height anamorphic or FHA) is a process by which a widescreen image is horizontally compressed to fit into a storage medium (photographic film or MPEG-2 standard-definition frame, for example) with a narrower aspect ratio, reducing the horizontal resolution of the image while keeping its full original vertical resolution. Compatible play-back equipment (a projector with modified lens, or a digital video player or set-top box) can then expand the horizontal dimension to show the original widescreen image. This is typically used to allow one to store widescreen images on a medium that was originally intended for a narrower ratio, while using as much of the frame – and therefore recording as much detail – as possible.

The technique comes from cinema, when a film would be framed and recorded as widescreen but the picture would be &quot;squashed together&quot; using a special concave lens to fit into non-widescreen 1.37:1 aspect ratio film. This film can then be printed and manipulated like any other 1.37:1 film stock, although the images on it will appear to be squashed horizontally (or elongated vertically). An anamorphic lens on the projector in the cinema (a convex lens) corrects the picture by performing the opposite distortion, returning it to its original width and its widescreen aspect ratio.

The optical scaling of the lens to a film medium is considered more desirable than the digital counterpart, due to the amount of non-proportional pixel-decimated scaling that is applied to the width of an image to achieve (something of a misnomer) a so-called &quot;rectangular&quot; pixel widescreen image. The legacy ITU-R Rec. 601 4:3 image size is used for its compatibility with the original video bandwidth that was available for professional video devices that used fixed clock rates of a SMPTE 259M serial digital interface. One would produce a higher-quality upscaled 16:9 widescreen image by using either a 1:1 SD progressive frame size of 640×360 or for ITU-R Rec. 601 and SMPTE 259M compatibility a letterboxed frame size of 480i or 576i. Similar operations are performed electronically to allow widescreen material to be stored on formats or broadcast on systems that assume a non-widescreen aspect ratio, such as DVD or standard definition digital television broadcasting.

==Film==

Many commercial films (especially epics – usually with the CinemaScope 2.35:1 optical sound or the older 4-track mag sound 2.55:1 aspect ratio) are recorded on standard 35 mm ~4:3 aspect ratio film, using an anamorphic lens to horizontally compress all footage into a ~4:3 frame. Another anamorphic lens on the movie theater projector corrects (optically decompresses) the picture (see anamorphic format for details). Other movies (often with aspect ratios of 1.85:1 in the USA or 1.66:1 in Europe) are made using the simpler matte technique, which involves both filming and projecting without any expensive special lenses. The movie is produced in 1.375 format, and then the resulting image is simply cropped in post-production (or perhaps in the theater&#x27;s projector) to fit the desired aspect ratio of 1.85:1 or 1.66:1 or whatever is desired. Besides costing less, the main advantage of the matte technique is that it leaves the studio with &quot;real&quot; footage (the areas that are cropped for the theatrical release) which can be used in preference to pan and scan when producing 4:3 DVD releases, for example.

The anamorphic encoding on DVD is related to the anamorphic filming technique (like CinemaScope) only by name. For instance, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) was filmed in 2.39:1 ratio using an anamorphic camera lens, and shown in theaters using the corresponding projector lens. Since it is a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would almost certainly use the anamorphic encoding process. &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; was filmed in 1.85:1 ratio without using an anamorphic lens on the camera, and similarly was shown in theaters without the need for the decompression lens. However, since it is also a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would probably use the anamorphic encoding process.

It does not matter whether the filming was done using the anamorphic lens technique: as long as the source footage is intended to be widescreen, the digital anamorphic encoding procedure is appropriate for the DVD release. As a sidenote, if a purely non-widescreen version of the analog-anamorphic &quot;Star Wars&quot; were to be released on DVD, the only options would be pan and scan or hardcoded 4:3 letterboxing (with the black letterboxes actually encoded as part of the DVD data).

==Laserdisc==

While not anamorphic widescreen per se, many of the earliest Laserdisc offerings forwent the pan-and-scan cropping typical of home releases at the time, the mastering-technicians opting instead to simply squeeze the film&#x27;s original aspect ratio down to 4:3. While this resulted in an image that was overly compressed on standard televisions, many later HDTVs can stretch out this picture, thus restoring the correct aspect ratio.

Later during the 1990s, a handful of Laserdiscs were released with proper anamorphic transfers. 
Video was stretched vertically to fill the whole 4:3 picture of a Laserdisc (and add more information where black bars would be at the top and bottom) then either un-squeezed horizontally on a 16:9 TV set or using an anamorphic lens on a 4:3 video projector.

==DVD Video==

A DVD labeled as &quot;Anamorphic Widescreen&quot; contains video that has the same frame size in pixels as traditional &quot;fullscreen&quot; video, but uses wider pixels. The shape of the pixels is called &quot;pixel aspect ratio&quot; and is encoded in the video stream for a DVD player to correctly identify the proportions of the video. If an anamorphic DVD video is played on standard 4:3 television without adjustment, the image will look horizontally squeezed. The menus are also anamorphic.

===Packaging===

Although currently there is no labeling standard, DVDs with content originally produced in an aspect ratio wider than 1.33:1 are typically labeled &quot;Anamorphic Widescreen&quot;, &quot;Enhanced for 16:9 televisions&quot;, &quot;Enhanced for widescreen televisions&quot;, or similar. If not so labeled, the DVD is intended for a 4:3 display (&quot;fullscreen&quot;), and will be letterboxed or panned and scanned.

There has been no clear standardization for companies to follow regarding the advertisement of anamorphically enhanced widescreen DVDs. Some companies, such as Universal and Disney, include the aspect ratio of the movie.

==Blu-ray video==
Unlike DVD, Blu-ray supports SMPTE HD resolutions of 720p and 1080i/p with a display aspect ratio of 16:9 and a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1, so widescreen video is scaled non-anamorphically (this is referred to as &quot;square&quot; pixels).

Blu-ray also supports anamorphic widescreen, both at the DVD-Video/D-1 resolutions of 720×480 (NTSC) and 720×576 (PAL), and at the higher resolution of 1440×1080 (source aspect ratio of 4:3, hence a pixel aspect ratio of 4:3 = 16:9 / 4:3 when used as anamorphic 16:9). See Blu-ray Disc: Technical specifications for details.

==Television==
Major digital television channels in Europe (for example, the five major UK terrestrial TV channels of BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5), as well as Australia, carry anamorphic widescreen programming in standard definition. In almost all cases, 4:3 programming is also transmitted on the same channel. The SCART switching signal can be used by a set-top-box to signal the television which kind of programming (4:3 or anamorphic) is currently being received, so that the television can change modes appropriately. The user can often elect to display widescreen programming in a 4:3 letterbox format instead of pan and scan if they do not have a widescreen television.

TV stations and TV networks can also include Active Format Description (AFD) just as DVDs can. Many ATSC tuners (integrated or set-top box) can be set to respond to this, or to apply a user setting. This can sometimes be set on a per-channel basis, and often on a per-input basis, and usually easily with a button on the remote control. However, tuners often fail to allow this on SDTV (480i-mode) channels, so that viewers are forced to view a small picture instead of cropping the unnecessary sides (which are outside of the safe area), or zooming to eliminate the windowboxing that may be causing a small picture, or stretching/compressing to eliminate other format-conversion errors. The shrunken pictures are especially troublesome for smaller TV sets.

Many modern HDTV sets have the capability to detect black areas in any video signal, and to smoothly re-scale the picture independently in both directions (horizontal and vertical) so that it fills the screen. However, some sets are 16:10 (1.6:1) like some computer monitors, and will not crop the left and right edges of the picture, meaning that all programming looks slightly (though usually imperceptibly) tall and thin.

ATSC allows two anamorphic widescreen SDTV formats (interlaced and progressive scan) which are 704×480 (10% wider than 640×480); this is narrower than the 720×480 of DVD due to 16 pixels being consumed by overscan (nominal analogue blanking) – see overscan: analog to digital resolution issues. The format can also be used for fullscreen programming, and in this case it is anamorphic with pixels slightly taller (10:11, or 0.91:1) than their width.

<doc id="468578" wikidata="Q6143357" url="?curid=468578" title="Lin Haiyin">
<text>Lin Haiyin (; born Lin Hanying; 18 March 1918 – 1 December 2001) was a Taiwanese writer and editor from a family in Miaoli County, Taiwan. She was born in Osaka, Japan, and lived in New Taipei City&#x27;s Panchiao district until the age of four before relocating to Beijing. Lin worked as a journalist and editor for the &quot;World Journal&quot; (世界日報) in Beijing before moving back to Taiwan with her family in 1948. In Taiwan, she served as an editor for the &quot;Mandarin Daily News&quot; (國語日報) and as the editor of the &quot;United Daily News&quot; (聯合報) supplement. She is best known for her 1960 book &quot;Memories of Peking: South Side Stories&quot; (), a novelistic tribute to her childhood reminiscences of Beijing.

==Early life and education==
Lin was born in Osaka, Japan, where her father (of Toufen, Miaoli County origin) worked as a merchant. Lin&#x27;s parents moved back to Taiwan briefly, then settling in Beijing when she was five. She spent her next 25 years there. In Beijing, Lin graduated from the News and Broadcast Institute and became a journalist for &quot;Shijie Ribao&quot; (&quot;World News Daily&quot;).

In 1948, Lin moved with her husband and family to Taiwan, where she became the editor of several important literary periodicals and newspapers, including the literary section of the &quot;United Daily News&quot; and &quot;The Literary Monthly&quot;, before eventually establishing her own publishing house. She would reside in Taiwan for the rest of her life.

Altogether, she published some 18 books, including novels, short story collections, radio drama and children&#x27;s literature, many of which deal with the feminine experience. Her most famous book is &quot;Memories of Peking: South Side Stories&quot; (1960). In it, Lin records in lively, evocative, first-person prose her childhood memories, ending with the death of her father, from the eyes of a precocious, impressionable young girl.

In 1967, Lin Hai-yin founded the literary magazine &quot;Belles-Lettres Monthly&quot; (純文學) and founded the Belles-Lettres Publishing House the following year, considered Taiwan&#x27;s first professional literary publishing house. For several decades, Lin and her writer husband, Hsia Cheng-ying (夏承楹, pen name He Fan [何凡]), engaged in the threefold work of editing, writing, and publishing, contributing significantly to the promotion of modern Taiwanese literature.

==Career==
Lin Haiyin is best known for her novel &quot;Memories of Peking: South Side Stories&quot; (城南舊事). Her literary works encompass a wide range, including novels, essays, broadcasts, children&#x27;s literature, essays, and literary criticism. Her protagonists often reflect the characters from the feudal old times she observed, especially women, and her stories, while often poignant, vividly portray the reality of society and the complexity of human nature.

Lin Haiyin played a crucial role in discovering and encouraging talented writers. Many authors, including Chi Teng Sheng (七等生) with &quot;Unemployment, Poker, Fried Squid&quot; (失業、撲克、炸魷魚), Cheng Ching-Wen (鄭清文) with &quot;Lonely Heart&quot; (寂寞的心), Huang Chun-ming (黃春明) with &quot;Getting Off at Chengtzu&quot; (城仔下車), and Lin Hwai-min (林懷民) with &quot;Children&#x27;s Song&quot; (兒歌), published their first works under her editorship at the &quot;United Daily News&quot; supplement. Lin Haiyin also encouraged Taiwanese writers who had stopped writing for many years, such as those who wrote in both Japanese rule and post-war eras, to resume their work. Notable figures she supported include Chung Li-ho (鍾理和), Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政), Liao Ching-hsiu (廖清秀), Chen Huo-chuan (陳火泉), Shih Tsui-feng (施翠峰), and others. She patiently helping them revise texts that were not smooth due to language differences before publishing them.

==Film adaptation==
In 1982, mainland Chinese director Wu Yigong made the film &quot;My Memories of Old Beijing&quot; based on her novel. The film won the Best Director Prize at the 3rd annual Golden Rooster Awards, as well as the Golden Eagle Prize (Best Feature Film) at the Manila International Film Festival in 1983. In 1999, it was chosen as one of the 100 best 20th-century Chinese-language films by &quot;Asia Weekly&quot;.

<text>The U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship is a standing committee of the United States Senate. It has jurisdiction over the Small Business Administration and is also charged with researching and investigating all problems of American small business enterprises.

==History==
===Special Committee to Study Problems of American Small Business===
On October 8, 1940, the Senate established the Special Committee to Study and Survey Problems of Small Business Enterprises (also known as the Special Committee to Study Problems of American Small Business).
The committee was chaired by James E. Murray (Montana.
The other members of the special committee were:
* Francis T. Maloney, Connecticut
* Arthur Capper, Kansas
* James M. Mead, New York
* Tom Stewart, Tennessee
* Claude Pepper, Florida (Chairman of the Subcommittee on Research and Education)
* James G. Scrugham, Nevada
* Robert A. Taft, Ohio
* George A. Wilson, Iowa
* Kenneth S. Wherry, Nebraska
* C. Douglass Buck, Delaware
Bertram Myron Gross was the Chief of Research and Hearings. With funding from the Carnegie Foundation of New York, he took responsibility for producing &quot;The Fate of Small Business in Nazi Germany&quot;, written by A. R. L. Gurland, Otto Kirchheimer and Franz Neumann.

On January 31, 1949, this special committee was terminated.

===Select Committee on Small Business===
On February 20, 1950, the Select Committee on Small Business was created with approval of Senate Resolution 58 during the 81st Congress. That first committee had just nine members. It was the first select committee created by the Senate that still operates today.

The select committee was terminated on March 25, 1981, when it became the Committee on Small Business, a standing committee. On June 29, 2001, Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) changed the name of the committee to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.

The committee&#x27;s jurisdiction has been changed several times since it was first created, through additional powers or by changing the manner in which committee members are appointed. While first established as a select committee with limited responsibilities, it now possesses virtually all the characteristics of a standing committee, as outlined under Senate Rule 25.

During the 96th Congress, the committee acted on legislation to reauthorize the Small Business Administration that expanded the agency to include loan programs for employee ownership, Small Business Development Centers, and increased export development assistance for small businesses.

Since its creation, the committee has held hearings on paperwork reduction and elimination (which eventually led to the Paperwork Reduction Act), capital formation, tax and securities law reform for small business, steel plant shutdowns, and the impact of inflation on governmental actions on the housing industry.

The committee was changed from small business to Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship beginning in 1981.

==Jurisdiction==
Initially, the Small Business Committee only had limited oversight over the Small Business Administration. The committee was directed to report to the Senate from time to time with its recommendations regarding small business matters.

With the adoption of S. Res. 272 during the 82nd Congress, the committee was granted subpoena power, and the ability to &quot;sit and act at such times during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate.&quot; These abilities are common to the other standing committees in the Senate. S. Res. 272 also provided for a more structured committee, with specific requirements on a quorum of members needed for the committee to conduct its business, and its own committee staff.

S. Res. 58 stipulated that beginning with the 95th Congress, the Small Business Committee would be granted jurisdiction over all legislation relating to the Small Business Administration. This ability was granted S. Res. 104, agreed to on April 29, 1976, provided for this new jurisdiction, granting not only authority over small business legislation but additional oversight over the agency as well. The committee has also been granted the right of re-referral of legislation from other standing committees, where appropriate.

Today, the jurisdiction of the committee is roughly the same as it was when it was first established, chiefly the Small Business Administration and the Small Investment Act. However, by tradition, the committee reviews all matters that apply to small business that are not by themselves subject to the jurisdiction over another standing committee. The committee continues to study and survey by means of research and investigation all problems of American small business enterprises, with the intent to provide advice to Congress in enacting appropriate legislation. The committee also is responsible for reviewing nominations for positions within the Small Business Administration, including its Administrator, Chief Council for Advocacy, and Inspector General.

<doc id="468580" wikidata="Q25822" url="?curid=468580" title="Right to life">
<text>The right to life is the belief that a human (or other animal) has the right to live and, in particular, should not be killed by another entity. The concept of a right to life arises in debates on issues including: capital punishment, with some people seeing it as immoral; abortion, with some considering the killing of a human embryo or fetus immoral; euthanasia, in which the decision to end one&#x27;s life outside of natural means is seen as incorrect; meat production and consumption, in which the breeding and killing of animals for their meat is seen by some people as an infringement on their rights; and in killings by law enforcement, which are seen by some as an infringement on those persons&#x27; right to live. However, individuals may disagree in which of these areas the principle of a right to life might apply.

==Abortion==
The term &quot;right to life&quot; is used in the abortion debate by those who wish to end the practice of abortion, or at least reduce the frequency of the practice, and in the context of pregnancy, the term &quot;right to life&quot; was advanced by Pope Pius XII during a 1951 papal encyclical:

Every human being, even the child in the womb, has the right to life directly from God and not from his parents, not from any society or human authority. Therefore, there is no man, no society, no human authority, no science, no “indication” at all whether it be medical, eugenic, social, economic, or moral that may offer or give a valid judicial title for a direct deliberate disposal of an innocent human life
:— Pope Pius XII, &quot;Address to Midwives on the Nature of Their Profession&quot; Papal Encyclical, October 29, 1951.

In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked Fr. James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in abortion reform within the United States. The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) was founded in 1967 as the Right to Life League to coordinate its state campaigns under the auspices of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. To appeal to a more broad-based, nonsectarian movement, key Minnesota leaders proposed an organizational model that would separate the NRLC from the direct oversight of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and by early 1973 NRLC Director Fr. James T. McHugh and his executive assistant, Michael Taylor, proposed a different plan, facilitating the NRLC move toward its independence from the Roman Catholic Church.

===Ethics and right to life===

Some utilitarian ethicists argue that the &quot;right to life&quot;, where it exists, depends on conditions other than membership of the human species. The philosopher Peter Singer is a notable proponent of this argument. For Singer, the right to life is grounded in the ability to plan and anticipate one&#x27;s future. This extends the concept to non-human animals, such as other apes, but since the unborn, infants and severely disabled people lack this, he states that abortion, painless infanticide and euthanasia can be &quot;justified&quot; (but are not obligatory) in certain special circumstances, for instance in the case of a disabled infant whose life would be one of suffering.

Bioethicists associated with disability rights and disability studies communities have argued that Singer&#x27;s epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability.

==Capital punishment==

Opponents of capital punishment argue that it is a violation of the right to life, while its supporters argue that the death penalty is not a violation of the right to life because the right to life should apply with deference to a sense of justice. The opponents believe that capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it &quot;cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment&quot;, and Amnesty International considers it to be &quot;the ultimate, irreversible denial of Human Rights&quot;.

The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition.

== Killings by law enforcement ==

The International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement has created a system whereby it is recognised that international human rights law is binding upon all state actors, and that said state actors must know and be capable of applying international standards for human rights. The right to life is for the most part an inalienable right granted to every human upon the planet, however, there are certain situations in which state actors are required to take drastic action, which can result in civilians being killed by law enforcement agents.

Appropriate occasions for killings by law enforcement are strictly outlined by the International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement. Any lethal action taken by law enforcement agents must be taken following a certain set of rules that have been set out in the &#x27;Use of Force&#x27; section of the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police. The essential tenet of the Pocket Book surrounding the use of lethal force is that all other means of a non-violent nature should be employed initially, followed by proportionately appropriate use of force. Proportionately appropriate use of force can, and will in some circumstances, refer to lethal force if a law enforcement agent genuinely believes that ending the life of one civilian would result in the preservation of his life, or the lives of his fellow civilians, as is outlined in the &#x27;Permissible Circumstances for the Use of Firearms&#x27; section of the Pocket Book. The Pocket Book also outlines in the &#x27;Accountability for the Use of Force and Firearms&#x27; section that there are stringent measures of accountability in place to maintain integrity within state law enforcement agencies as regards their right to the use of lethal force.

International institutions have outlined when and where law enforcement agents might have the availability of lethal force at their disposal. The International Association of Chiefs of Police have &#x27;Model Policies&#x27; which incorporate various pieces of information from leading sources. One of these model policies states that law enforcement agents will engage in reasonable necessary force to efficiently bring a scenario to a conclusion, giving specific thought to both the safety of themselves and other civilians. Law enforcement officers are given the prerogative to engage in department-approved methods to safely bring a conclusion to a scenario and are also given the ability to use issued equipment to resolve issues in scenarios where they are required to protect themselves or others from damage, to bring resistant individuals under control, or to safely conclude unlawful incidents. There is no mention as to what &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; should be interpreted as meaning, but there is reference made to the reasonable man method of determining how one should approach a scenario. However, it has been highlighted through events such as the killing of Michael Brown by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, which resulted in public unrest, that there is confusion and debate surrounding the use of firearms and lethal force. The &#x27;Procedure for the Use of Firearms&#x27; section provides the process through which law enforcement agents must progress when using firearms. It states that they must identify themselves as a law enforcement agent, issue a clear warning, and give an adequate amount of time for response (providing that time would not likely result in harm being done to the agent or other civilians) before deadly force can be used within the bounds of international law.

While the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police outlines the academic circumstances under which law enforcement agents may use lethal force, the literal scenarios in which police killings have occurred are also relevant. Rosenfeld states that there is considerable literature that gives reason to believe that social conditions also have a part to play in how law enforcement killings can occur. Rosenfeld states that there are numerous studies that have been conducted which link law enforcement agents&#x27; use of lethal force to the area&#x27;s rate of violent crime, the size of the non-indigenous population and the socioeconomic position of the community concerned. Appropriating a blanket description of how police killings can occur across the board is difficult given the vast differences in social context from state to state.

Perry, Hall and Hall discuss the phenomena across the United States of America which became highly charged and widely documented in late 2014, referring to the use of lethal force from white police officers on unarmed black male civilians. There is no legal prerogative which gives law enforcement agents the ability to use lethal force based on the race of the person they are dealing with, there is only a legal prerogative to engage in lethal force if there is a reasonable fear for your life or the lives of others. However, the Propublica analysis of federal data on fatal police shootings between 2010 and 2012, showed that young black male civilians were 21 times more likely to be killed by police than young white male civilians. The use of lethal force from law enforcement agents in the United States created widespread feeling amongst US citizens that they were not being protected by the police. The justice system mostly found that these agents acted within the boundaries of the law because the actions of the people who were shot were judged to be sufficiently questionable in character for the police officer to fear for their own life or the lives of others. Coppolo investigated Connecticut law and reported that the use of lethal force must be followed by a report that determines whether the law enforcement agent&#x27;s lethal force was proportionately necessary in the circumstances. Coppolo also stated that a reasonable lethal response must only be made when there is a reasonable belief that the facts you have been presented with could realistically result in a risk of death or grievous bodily harm.

== Animals ==

In &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, Peter Singer writes that the killing of animals for the consumption of their meat should be seen as immoral and a violation of their right to life. He holds that rights should be based on sentience, rather than species membership.

Numerous authors have invoked the argument from marginal cases to argue that animals should have similar moral status to human infants, senile people, the comatose, and cognitively disabled people.

A 2020 survey of 1812 published English-language philosophers found that 48% said it was permissible to eat animals in ordinary circumstances, while 45% said it was not.

==Euthanasia==

Those who believe a person should be able to make the decision to end their own life through euthanasia use the argument that persons have a &quot;right to choose&quot;, while those who oppose the legalization of euthanasia argue so on the grounds that all persons have a right to life, which they interpret as an &quot;obligation to live&quot;. They are commonly referred to as &quot;right-to-lifers&quot;.

The European Convention on Human Rights defended the possibility of the existence of a “right to die” through the application of euthanasia and granting the individual the right to choose the method of implementing this type of dying, considering that the latter is one of the parts of the right to life.

==Juridical statements==
*In 1444, the Poljica Statute declared a right to live &quot;-for nothing existed forever&quot;.
*In 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence declared that &quot;all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;.
*In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly declared in article three:

*In 1950, the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted by the Council of Europe, declaring a protected human right to life in Article 2. There are exceptions for lawful executions and self-defense, arresting a fleeing suspect, and suppressing riots and insurrections. Since then Protocol 6 of the convention has called for nations to outlaw capital punishment except in time of war or national emergency, and at present this pertains in all countries of the council. Protocol 13 provides for the total abolition of capital punishment, and has been implemented in most member countries of the council.
*In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.

*In 1969, the American Convention on Human Rights was adopted in San José, Costa Rica by many countries in the Western Hemisphere. It is in force in 23 countries.

*In 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms enshrined that

*In 1989, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
*The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany holds the principle of human dignity paramount, even above the right to life.
*The Catholic Church has issued a &quot;Charter of the Rights of the Family&quot; in which it states that the right to life is directly implied by human dignity.
*Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, 1950, guarantees the right to life to all persons within the territory of India and states: &quot;No person shall be deprived of his right to life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.&quot; Article 21 confers on every person the fundamental right to life and personal liberty which has become an inexhaustible source of many other rights.
The right to life is considered the most important and first right urged by the European Convention on Human Rights, and it is a right granted to all persons, which makes it necessary in the system of basic human rights and freedoms that this Convention works to protect and preserve.

<text>The media of Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers; for the majority of all these the language is Spanish. There are also three stations of the American Forces Network.

==Newspapers==

==Magazines==
==Radio stations==
Radio transmission first began in Puerto Rico on December 3, 1922 with WKAQ (AM), making it the first radio broadcasting station on the island and the fifth in the world. Its purpose was to transmit news and weather updates with commercials. By 1937, the advertising industry had entered radio on the Island; and by the year 1942, there were five radio broadcasting stations in Puerto Rico. These five stations were based in San Juan, Ponce and Mayagüez.

There are currently over one hundred and forty radio stations being broadcast in Puerto Rico as of March 1, 2019. These radio stations broadcast in different formats, some of the most popular being religious, news/talk, and music. The city of San Juan currently transmits more radio stations than any other city in Puerto Rico. Ponce and Mayagüez also remain popular locations for radio transmission.

Radio transmission in Puerto Rico was highly interrupted during Hurricane Maria. After Hurricane Maria had passed, there was a spike in radio use in Puerto Rico, as it served as a main source of news information after the natural disaster.

The following radio stations transmit from Puerto Rico:

<doc id="468592" wikidata="Q4983591" url="?curid=468592" title="Bucky Dent">
<text>Russell Earl &quot;Bucky&quot; Dent (né O&#x27;Dey; born November 25, 1951) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, and Kansas City Royals from 1973 to 1984. He managed the Yankees in 1989 and 1990.

Dent earned two World Series rings as the starting shortstop for the Yankees in 1977 and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers and was voted the World Series Most Valuable Player Award in 1978. Dent is most famous for his home run in a tie-breaker game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park at the end of the 1978 regular season.

==Early life==
Born in Savannah, Georgia, to Denise O&#x27;Dey and Russell &quot;Shorty&quot; Stanford, Dent went home from the hospital with his mother&#x27;s brother James Earl Dent, and James&#x27; wife, Sarah. Bucky and his half-brother were raised by the Dents, who changed his last name to &quot;Dent&quot;, but his mother would not allow them to legally adopt. He and his half-brother were led to believe the Dents were their biological parents, until he was ten years old. Dent was told the woman he knew as his aunt was in fact his mother. Later in life, he was told the name of his father, whom he then found, thus sparking and developing a relationship.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Dent grew up in Sylvania, Georgia, and Hialeah, Florida, graduating from Hialeah High School.

The Chicago White Sox selected Dent in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, in the 1970 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 1973. His best season with the White Sox was in 1975 when he batted .264, led American League shortstops with a .981 fielding percentage and was selected as a reserve for the MLB All-Star Game. After his $50,000-a-year contract expired at the conclusion of the 1976 campaign, he rejected the White Sox&#x27;s three-year $500,000 offer. His agent Nick Buoniconti explained, &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that the White Sox can&#x27;t afford Dent. He is one of the best shortstops in the American League, and he should be paid like one.&quot;

The White Sox traded Dent to the New York Yankees for Oscar Gamble, LaMarr Hoyt, minor league pitcher Bob Polinsky and He signed a three-year $600,000 contract upon his arrival. For the Yankees, Dent was an upgrade over Fred Stanley, the starting shortstop the previous year. The Yankees gave him uniform number 20 and they went on to win the World Series that year.

===1978===
In 1978, Dent is widely remembered for hitting a three-run home run that gave the Yankees a lead in the AL East division tie-breaker game against the Boston Red Sox. This was all the more remarkable because Dent was not a power hitter; his seventh-inning home run was one of only 40 he hit in his entire 12-year career. Further, Dent occupied the ninth spot in the batting order, not generally considered a power slot, and did it with a bat borrowed from center fielder Mickey Rivers. The Yankees went on to win the game for the division title; Boston was left out of the playoffs, after squandering one of the largest July leads in major league history. Generations of Red Sox fans have since referred to him as &quot;Bucky Fucking Dent&quot;.

Dent continued his unusually high production by batting .417 (10–24, 7 RBI) in the World Series, earning Series Most Valuable Player honors, as the Yankees again defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 

===1979–1984===

A three-time All-Star, Dent remained the Yankees&#x27; shortstop until 1982, when he was traded to the Texas Rangers in August for outfielder Lee Mazzilli. During his six years with the Yankees, Dent lived in Wyckoff, New Jersey, in a home he later rented to Don Zimmer.

On the Rangers, his uniform number was 7. Dent returned to the Yankees briefly in 1984 (but never played a game) before finishing his career that season with the Kansas City Royals, wearing uniform number 21. He spent his entire 12-year playing career in the American League, with a .247 batting average and 423 RBI.

Tommy John observed that Dent&#x27;s throwing arm was not the strongest and that his range was limited. In spite of that, he was extremely reliable on balls he was able to get to. &quot;He knew how to position himself, and he got to balls that were missed by other shortstops with better range,&quot; John said, adding that the player &quot;was kind of taken for granted, until the Yankees unloaded him and discovered what he meant to the infield&quot;.

==Post-career activities==
After retiring as a player, Dent managed in the Yankees&#x27; minor-league system, notably with the Columbus Clippers. He served the Yankees as manager of the big-league club for portions of two seasons, compiling an 18–22 record in and an 18–31 record in . Owner George Steinbrenner hired Dent only as a stopgap, and did not believe he could lead the Yankees back to postseason play. He intended to replace Dent with Billy Martin at the earliest opportunity in 1990, but those plans were brought undone when Martin died in a car accident on Christmas Day in 1989.

In 1989 Dent opened a baseball school at Delray Beach, Florida, which featured a miniature version of Fenway Park. Although Dent had his greatest moment as a player at Fenway Park, his worst moment also came at Fenway Park when he was fired as manager of the Yankees. Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and said he should &quot;have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore&quot; to fire Dent. He said that &quot;if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George&#x27;s jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook&quot;. He also said that &quot;the firing was only special because...it&#x27;s the first time a Yankee manager...was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay&quot;. However, Bill Pennington called the firing of Dent &quot;merciless.&quot; But Yankees television analyst Tony Kubek blasted at Steinbrenner for the firing in a harsh, angry way. At the beginning of the broadcast of the game on MSG Network, he said to Yankees television play-by-play announcer Dewayne Staats, &quot;George Steinbrenner...mishandled this. You don&#x27;t take a Bucky Dent (at) the site of one of the greatest home runs in Yankee history and fire him and make it a media circus for the Boston Red Sox.&quot; He then stared defiantly on camera and said to Steinbrenner, &quot;You don&#x27;t do it by telephone, either, George. You do it face to face, eyeball to eyeball...If you really are a winner, you should not have handled this like a loser.&quot; He then said, angrily, &quot;George, you&#x27;re a bully and a coward.&quot; He then said that &quot;What all this does, it just wrecks George Steinbrenner&#x27;s credibility with his players, with the front office and in baseball more than it already is–if that&#x27;s possible. It was just mishandled.&quot; The firing of Dent shook New York to its core and the Yankees flagship radio station then, WABC, which also criticized the firing, ran editorials demanding that Steinbrenner sell the team.

From 1991 to 1994, Dent served on the coaching staff of the St. Louis Cardinals under manager Joe Torre, moving to the coaching staff of the Texas Rangers from 1995 to 2001.

In 2002, Dent served as the manager for the Omaha Royals, the Triple A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals.

In 2003, when the Green Monster seats were added to Fenway Park, Dent attended the first game and sat in a Green Monster seat that was very near to where his 1978 home run landed. No animosity was displayed towards him by Red Sox fans at that game, who were all cordial to him.

Dent threw out the first pitch to Yogi Berra in the seventh and final game of the 2004 American League Championship Series.

In November 2005, Dent became the bench coach for the Cincinnati Reds. The Cincinnati Reds released Dent on July 3, 2007; just a few days after releasing manager Jerry Narron. At the time, the Reds had the worst record in Major League Baseball.

Every year, ESPN hosts a company softball game named after Dent in Central Park, New York City.

Dent currently hosts a podcast, Deep to Left with Bucky Dent.

==Managerial record==
==Non-baseball work==

In 1979, Dent posed for a pin-up poster. That year he also appeared in the TV movie &quot;Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders&quot;, portraying a wide receiver who was the love interest of one of the cheerleaders. He also appeared in the September 1983 issue of &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine wearing a swimsuit.

In 2014, Dent made a cameo as a father in the feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;.

==Personal life==
He now lives in Bradenton, Florida, with his wife, Angie Aberson, with whom he eloped in November 2019.

His wife, Marianne, died on October 22, 2015; they were the parents of twin children, Cody and Caitlin. He also has two children with his ex-wife, Karen “Stormie” Neale, Scott and Stacy.

One of his daughters, Caitlin, played softball at North Carolina State from 2010 to 2013, and was an assistant coach for the Hofstra softball team during the 2015 season, while Cody Dent played baseball at Florida.

<doc id="468593" wikidata="Q3240764" url="?curid=468593" title="Shell USA">
<text>Shell USA, Inc. (formerly Shell Oil Company, Inc.) is the United States–based wholly owned subsidiary of Shell plc, a UK-based transnational corporation &quot;oil major&quot; which is among the largest oil companies in the world. Approximately 18,000 Shell employees are based in the U.S. Its U.S. headquarters are in Houston, Texas. Shell USA, including its consolidated companies and its share in equity companies, is one of America&#x27;s largest oil and natural gas producers, natural gas marketers, fuel marketers and petrochemical manufacturers.

==History==
In 1979, Shell purchased Belridge Oil Company for $3.65 billion, which at the time was called the &quot;biggest cash takeover in American history&quot; by US government sources. 

In 1997, Shell and Texaco entered into two refining/marketing joint ventures. One combined their Midwestern and Western operations and was known as Equilon. The other, known as Motiva Enterprises, combined the Eastern and Gulf Coast operations of Shell Oil and Star Enterprise, itself a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Texaco.

After Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001, Shell purchased Texaco&#x27;s shares in the joint ventures. In 2002, Shell began converting these Texaco stations to the Shell brand, a process that was to be completed by June 2004 and was called &quot;the largest retail re-branding initiative in American business history&quot;.

In recent years, The Shell Oil Company&#x27;s Midstream, and Downstream, in particular, have become limited to petroleum, and chemical products. This has come as a result of Royal Dutch Shell breaking off its Natural Gas and power businesses into a new segment named Integrated Gas. The Shell Oil Company&#x27;s former Natural Gas, and energy divisions are now Shell Energy North America, a closely integrated, but a distinctive entity that runs across North America and is headquartered out of Houston, Texas.

==Activities==
Shell is the market leader through approximately 14,000 Shell-branded fuel stations in the U.S. which also serve as Shell&#x27;s most visible public presence, and comes closest to serving all 50 states, lacking a presence only in Montana. At its gas stations, Shell provides diesel fuel, fuel and LPG. Shell Oil Company was a 50/50 partner with the Saudi Arabian government-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in Motiva Enterprises, a refining and marketing joint venture which owns and operates three oil refineries on the Gulf Coast of the United States. However, Shell is currently divesting its interest in Motiva.

Shell products include oils, fuels, and car services as well as exploration, production, and refining of petroleum products. The Shell Martinez Refinery in Martinez, California, the first Shell refinery in the United States, supplied Shell and Texaco stations in the West and Midwest until its sale to PBF Energy in 2020. 

Shell fuel previously included the RU2000 and SU2000 lines (later there was a SU2000E) but they have been superseded by the V-Power line.

In 2023 Shell USA (North American division of Shell plc) became the &quot;Official Fuel of the NTT IndyCar Series&quot; they will supply 100% Ethanol-sourced fuel. They are also the &quot;Official Fuel of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway&quot;.

In 2023, the first deliveries of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Shell Trading (US) Company (Shell) from Montana Renewables took place. The companies have entered into a multi-year agreement, with the fuel received being distributed by Shell and subsidiaries across the country to accelerate decarbonization.

Shell is preparing to sell its onshore business in Nigeria&#x27;s Niger Delta for $2.4 billion (€2.2 billion) to a consortium of companies in 2024. The acquiring consortium is Renaissance, which includes ND Western, Aradel Energy, First E&amp;P, Waltersmith and Petrolin. The assets include 15 onshore leases and three shallow water fields. The deal needs to be approved by the national government before it can be finalized.

==Relationship with Shell plc==

Until the mid-1980s, Shell&#x27;s business in the United States was substantially independent. Limited direct involvement from the main office in The Hague, Netherlands, and having its stock &quot;Shell Oil&quot; traded on the New York Stock Exchange were factors. However, in 1984, Royal Dutch Shell made a bid to purchase those shares of Shell Oil Company it did not own (around 30%) and despite some opposition from some minority shareholders which led to a court case, Shell completed the buyout for a sum of $5.7 billion.

Despite the acquisition, however, Shell Oil remained a fairly independent business. This was due in part to complex legal reasons, as Royal Dutch Shell feared that there could be onerous liability problems if closer control of Shell Oil&#x27;s affairs was exercised by the &quot;parent company&quot;. One consequence of this independence was that the Shell logo used in the U.S. was slightly different from that used in the rest of the world. In the 1980s, Shell Oil&#x27;s independence began to gradually erode as the &quot;parent company&quot; took a more hands-on approach to running the business. The logo used in the United States is the same as that used elsewhere since June 1, 1998.

In January 2018, Royal Dutch Shell acquired a 44% interest in solar energy company Silicon Ranch, run by CEO Matt Kisber. The takeover was part of the global New Energies project, with the aim of bringing solar renewable options to U.S. customers. The company paid up to an estimated $217 million to take over from former minority shareholders Partners Group.

In October 2018, the company installed a 285-foot-high quench tower at the Shell Chemical Appalachia L.L.C. Pittsburgh plant, which transfers heat absorbed by the water circulation process to use across other areas of the site.

==Legal issues==
===Environmental===
Shell Puget Sound Refinery, Anacortes, Washington, was fined $291,000 from 2006 to 2010 for violations of the Clean Air Act making it the second most-fined violator in the Pacific Northwest. , it has been listed as a &quot;high-priority violator&quot; since 2008.

In 2008, a lawsuit was filed against Shell Oil Company for alleged Clean Air Act violation. Shell Deer Park Refinery 20 miles east of Houston, was the nation&#x27;s eighth-largest oil refinery and one of the world&#x27;s largest petrochemical producers. The facility was also the second-largest source of air pollution in Harris County, which ranked among the lowest in the nation in several measures of air quality. According to Sierra Club and Environment Texas, analysis of Shell&#x27;s reports to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, air pollutants released at Deer Park since 2003 exceeded the EPA&#x27;s emissions limits.

Will Oremus from Slate magazine states, &quot;The company&#x27;s business depends on being able to anticipate and respond quickly to seismic shifts in the energy market. So it employs a team of big-thinking futurists, called scenario planners, to keep it a step ahead. In 2008, the company released a fresh pair of scenarios for how the world might respond to climate change over the coming decades. Both were predicated on what the company called &#x27;three hard truths&#x27;: that global energy demand is rising, that the supply of conventional energy will not be able to keep up, and that climate change is both real and dangerous.&quot;

Between 1978 and 1995, Shell Oil produced polybutylene pipes, which corrode when exposed to chlorine. A class action lawsuit was filed in 1995 against Shell Oil when the polybutylene pipes caused flooding in many households in the U.S. and Canada. The settlement required Shell Oil to pay for the re-installation of piping for millions of houses for claims filed through May 2009.

===Campaign violations===
About 6,000 Shell workers and contractors were instructed to attend a Donald Trump speech held on August 13, 2019, or take the day off without pay, losing about $700 from overtime and per diem. During his address, Trump called out specific union leaders to declare their voting loyalty. Many of the union leaders present were not consulted before the event, and memos sent to contractor management forbade any protest. Federal law prohibits a corporation from making a contribution.

<doc id="468594" wikidata="Q1050891" url="?curid=468594" title="Nikumaroro">
<text>Nikumaroro, previously known as Kemins Island or Gardner Island, is a part of the Phoenix Islands, Kiribati, in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a remote, elongated, triangular coral atoll with profuse vegetation and a large central marine lagoon. Nikumaroro is about long by wide. The rim has two narrow entrances, both of which are blocked by a wide reef, which is dry at low tide. The ocean beyond the reef is very deep, and the only anchorage is at the island&#x27;s west end, across the reef from the ruins of a mid-20th-century British colonial village, but this is safe only with the southeast trade winds. Landing has always been difficult and is most often done south of the anchorage. Although occupied at various times during the past, the island is uninhabited today.

Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008. The 425,300-km2 (164,200-mi2) marine reserve contains eight coral atolls including Nikumaroro.

Nikumaroro has notably been the focus of considerable speculation and exploration as a possible location where pilot Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan might have landed in July 1937 when they vanished during their ill-fated flight to circumnavigate the globe. However, to date, no conclusive evidence of her plane has been found on or in the vicinity of the island.

==Geography==
Thick scrub and &quot;Pisonia&quot; forest cover the land surface. The trees grow in height and result in decomposing leaf material in the soil. Coconut palms remain from the attempts to operate a plantation on the island from 1893 to 1894 and later from 1938 to 1963.

The scarcity of fresh water on Nikumaroro has proven problematic for residents in the past, and contributed directly to the failure of a British project to colonize the island from 1938 to 1963.

==Flora and fauna==
===Nikumaroro&#x27;s flora and fauna===

Nikumaroro is sporadically visited by biologists attracted to its extensive marine and avian ecosystems. The atoll has populations of coconut crabs and migratory birds, and rats abound. Several species of sharks and bottlenose dolphins have been observed in the surrounding waters.

The island is part of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, and as such, has been named an Important Bird Area, especially for its breeding colony of red-tailed tropicbirds.

===Nikumaroro&#x27;s reefs===
The 2000 surveys (Obura, et al.) identified that the leeward sites on the reef had 25-40% Live Coral Cover (LCC), in some places exceeding 75% LCC on the shallow reef platforms. Coralline algae, &quot;Halimeda&quot; and coral rubble were the three other dominant cover categories. The windward sites on the reef had an estimated 70% LCC and the lower cover on the reef slope was 30% LCC. The steep slope was dominated by &quot;Halimeda&quot; with plates of &quot;Porites rus&quot;. In contrast to the leeward side, very little loose coral rubble was found with the majority of bare surfaces covered by encrusting coralline algae in shallow water. The most abundant coral species at Nikumaroro included: &quot;Acroporidae&quot; (staghorn corals); &quot;Acropora cytherea&quot;; &quot;Montipora efflorescens&quot;; &quot;Favites pentagona&quot;; &quot;Leptastrea purpurea&quot;; &quot;Pocillopora verrucosa&quot;; &quot;Pavona minuta&quot; and &quot;Pavona varians&quot;.

Nikumaroro is in a naturally iron-poor region. The introduction of iron to this environment from shipwrecks and anchor gear is linked to proliferation of turf algae and benthic bacterial communities, and degraded ‘black reefs’. Monitoring from 2000 to 2015 recorded the black reef originating at the 1929 wreck of the SS &quot;Norwich City&quot; on Nikumaroro progressing northward to sites away.

==Pre-history==
===Evidence of prehistoric occupation===
Little is known of habitation on the island prior to 1824. What evidence there is for pre-historic occupation is slim and unsubstantiated.

In 1989, an expedition to the island by TIGHAR suggested that what they believed to be fish traps on the shore of the island was indeed evidence of long forgotten pacific natives. Also found by TIGHAR&#x27;s work party was what was believed to be a basalt adze.

===Identity of prehistoric peoples===
The ancient settlements on nearby Manra and Orona Island were probably founded around 1000 BC, when eastern Melanesians are known to have travelled northwards across the water. These have yielded basalt artifacts that originated in Samoa, the Marquesas, and the Cook Islands, and were transported to the Phoenix and Line Islands during the 12th–14th centuries AD. 
There is evidence to suggest that Howland Island was the site of a prehistoric settlement, which may have extended down to Rawaki, Canton, Manra and Orona - and possibly Nikumaroro.
Archaeological sites have been discovered on Manra and Orona that suggest there were two distinct groups of settlers in the area, one from eastern Polynesia, and one from Micronesia.

==History==
===19th-century sightings and claims===
Nikumaroro was known by sundry names during the early 19th century: Kemins&#x27; Island, Kemis Island, &quot;Motu Oonga&quot;, &quot;Motu Oona&quot;, and Mary Letitia&#x27;s Island. The first record of a European sighting was made by Capt. C. Kemiss (or Kemin, Kemish) from the British whaling ship &quot;Eliza Ann&quot; in 1824. On 19 August 1840, the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; of the U.S. Exploring Expedition confirmed its position and recorded the atoll&#x27;s name as Gardner Island, originally given in 1825 by Joshua Coffin of the Nantucket whaler &quot;Ganges&quot;. Some sources say the island was named after U.S. Congressman Gideon Gardner, who owned the &quot;Ganges&quot;.

In 1856, Nikumaroro was claimed as &quot;Kemins Island&quot; by CA Williams &amp; Co. of New London, Connecticut, under the American Guano Islands Act. No record exists of guano deposits ever being exploited, however. On 28 May 1892, the island was claimed by the United Kingdom during a call by HMS &quot;Curacoa&quot;. Almost immediately, a license was granted to Pacific entrepreneur John T. Arundel for planting coconuts. Twenty-nine islanders were settled there and some structures with corrugated iron roofs were constructed, but a severe drought resulted in the failure of this project within a year. In 1916, it was leased to a Captain E.F.H. Allen of the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, but remained uninhabited until 1938.

===SS &quot;Norwich City&quot; wreck===
During a storm on 29 November 1929, the SS &quot;Norwich City&quot;, a large unladen British freighter with a crew of 35 men, ran aground on the reef at the island&#x27;s northwest corner. A fire broke out in the engine room and all hands abandoned ship in darkness through storm waves across the dangerous coral reef. There were 11 fatalities. The survivors camped near collapsed structures from the abortive Arundel coconut plantation and were rescued after several days on the island. The devastated wreck of the &quot;Norwich City&quot; was a prominent landmark on the reef for 70 years, although by 2007, only the ship&#x27;s keel, engine, and two large tanks remained. A Digital Globe satellite image taken 15 November 2016 shows one of the two tanks pushed inland by wave action, and the engine is now gone.

===Amelia Earhart===

Amelia Earhart attempted her world flight in 1937, but she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared after the plane left Lae, New Guinea, and headed for Howland Island. Nikumaroro Island—then called Gardner Island—is about southeast of Howland Island. During the subsequent search for them and their plane, the United States Navy checked several nearby islands, and flew over Gardner Island, noting &quot;signs of recent habitation&quot;, though they presumed the island was uninhabited. A British exploratory expedition visited Gardner Island in October 1937 but found nothing. In 1938, recent skeletal remains were found on the island, but they were not linked to Earhart&#x27;s flight.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) made several expeditions to Nikumaroro during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. The group investigated the renewed hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan had landed on Gardner Island after they had failed to find Howland Island, and died as castaways. TIGHAR found and cataloged artifacts: U.S. beauty and skin-care products that may have dated to the 1930s, such as flakes of rouge and a shattered mirror from a woman&#x27;s cosmetic compact, parts of a folding pocket knife, traces of campfires bearing bird and fish bones, clams opened in the same way as oysters in New England, &quot;empty shells laid out as if to collect rain water&quot;, and U.S. bottles dating from before World War II. What appeared to be the phalanx bone of a human finger had DNA tests done, but the tests were inconclusive as to whether it was turtle or human bone. A piece of aircraft-grade aluminum found on the island closely resembles a patch that is in photographs of Earhart&#x27;s airplane.

The TIGHAR hypothesis has various critics, with TIGHAR&#x27;s founder and executive director, Richard Gillespie, described as a good showman who lacks credible results. A curator at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Air and Space Museum said: &quot;Not to impugn [Gillespie], but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s found anything on any expedition.&quot; 

Ocean explorer Robert Ballard led a 2019 expedition to locate Earhart&#x27;s Lockheed Model 10-E Electra or evidence that it landed on Nikumaroro. After days of searching the deep cliffs supporting the island and the nearby ocean, Ballard did not find any evidence of the plane or any associated wreckage of it. Allison Fundis, Ballard&#x27;s chief operating officer stated: &quot;We felt like if her plane was there, we would have found it pretty early in the expedition.&quot;

In their October 2019 documentary, &quot;Expedition Amelia&quot; tracing Robert Ballard&#x27;s efforts, National Geographic stated regarding the Gardner Island (Nikumaroro) hypothesis, &quot;It’s a nice story. But like all the other evidence obtained here over the decades, there is no provable link to Amelia or her plane.&quot;

===British settlement scheme===

On 1 December 1938, members of the British Pacific Islands Survey Expedition arrived to evaluate the island as a possible location for either seaplane landings or an airfield. On 20 December, more British officials arrived with 20 Gilbertese settlers in the last colonial expansion of the British Empire (other than formal annexations preparatory to withdrawal, etc.).

The British colonial officer Gerald Gallagher established a headquarters of the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme in the village located on the island&#x27;s western end, on the south side of the largest entrance to the lagoon. Efforts to clear land and plant coconuts were hindered by a lack of drinking water. By June 1939, a few wells had been successfully established and 58 I-Kiribati were on Gardner, comprising 16 men, 16 women, and 26 children. Wide coral-gravel streets and a parade ground were laid out and important structures included a thatched administration house, a wood-frame cooperative store, and a radio shack. Gallagher died and was buried on the island in 1941.

At his mother&#x27;s request, Gallagher&#x27;s remains were moved to Tarawa for reburial and the memorial plaque was retrieved. Although reasons cited for giving up on the struggling colony included unstable water lenses and uncertain copra markets, observers familiar with the colony&#x27;s history remarked that after Gallagher&#x27;s death a &quot;will&quot; or &quot;nerve&quot; to succeed seemed to vanish from the settlements.

From 1944 through 1945, the United States Coast Guard operated a navigational LORAN station with 25 crewmen on the southeastern tip of Gardner, installing an antenna system, quonset huts, and some smaller structures. Only scattered debris remains on the site.

The island&#x27;s population reached a high of about 100 by the mid-1950s, but by the early 1960s, periodic drought and an unstable freshwater lens had thwarted the struggling colony. Nikumaroro (together with Manra and Orona) was evacuated by the British government in 1963. Its residents were evacuated to the Solomon Islands by the British, and by 1965, Gardner was officially uninhabited.

The Gardner Island Post Office opened around 1939 and closed around January 1964.

===Kiribati===

In 1971, the UK granted self-rule to the Gilbert Islands, which achieved complete independence in 1979 as Kiribati. That same year, the United States, after having recently surveyed the island for possible weapons testing, relinquished any claims to Gardner through the Treaty of Tarawa. The island was officially renamed Nikumaroro, a name inspired by Gilbertese legends and used by the settlers during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Island folklore==
===Nei Manganibuka===
The current name for the Island, Nikumaroro, comes from the name of a legendary goddess of the Gilbertese people, &quot;Nei Manganibuka&quot;. It is said that she comes from Samoa, is associated with the Buka tree, and first taught the Gilbertese canoe craft along with the lore of ocean navigation. Nikumaroro was named by the natives who accomanied the British during a visit to the island in 1938. In Tungaru (Gilbertese), “Nei” is roughly the equivalent of Miss or Ms, and “Manganibuka” means “old woman of the Buka trees.”

In an interview in 1997, Risasi Finikaso, who lived in Nikumaroro as a child, remarked of a place called Niurabo which was sacred to Nei Manganibuka.

===Ghost Maneaba===
According to legend, the wife of Teng Koata, the first island leader of Nikumaroro, had been walking along the north-western part of the island when she saw a &quot;great and perfect maneaba&quot;. It is said that this was the maneaba of Nei Manganibuka who she saw sitting under its high thatched roof. Nei Manganibuka was seated with two children, and conversing with three ancients about the happy future of Nikumaroro and how it would one day support thousands of inhabitants. In later years this spot became known as Ghost Maneaba, though the area is now known as Kanawa Point.

<doc id="468607" wikidata="Q187346" url="?curid=468607" title="Constantine, Algeria">
<text>Constantine (), also spelled Qacentina or Kasantina, is the capital of Constantine Province in northeastern Algeria. During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed &quot;Constantina&quot; in honour of Emperor Constantine the Great. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River.

Constantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial centre of its region and has a population of about 450,000 (938,475 with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after Algiers and Oran. There are several museums and historical sites located around the city. Constantine is often referred to as the &quot;City of Bridges&quot; because of the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around.

Constantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

In antiquity, the city was originally called Cirta and served as the capital of the Berber kingdom of Numidia. In 112 B.C., the city was the capital of the Numidian king Jugurtha, who defeated his half-brother Adherbal. The city later served as the base for Roman generals Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus and Gaius Marius in their war against Jugurtha. Later, with the removal of King Juba I and the remaining supporters of Pompey in Africa (), Julius Caesar gave special rights to the citizens of Cirta, now known as Colonia Sittlanorum.

In 311 AD, during the civil war between emperor Maxentius and usurper Domitius Alexander (a former governor of Africa), the city was destroyed. Rebuilt in 313 AD, it was subsequently named in Latin as &quot;Colonia Constantiniana&quot; or &quot;Constantina&quot;, after emperor Constantine the Great, who had defeated Maxentius. During Roman rule, the city exported wheat and was the only population center that lay on both of the Roman roads paved in ancient Algeria. Captured by the Vandals in 432, Constantine returned to the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa from 534 to 697. Following the Arab conquest of the city in the 8th century, it became known as &quot;Qacentina&quot;. The city was a part of the wider region of Ifriqiya.

=== Modern history ===
The city recovered in the 12th century and under Almohad and Hafsid rule it was again a prosperous market, with links to Pisa, Genoa and Venice. After taking it from the Hafsids in 1529 it was intermittently part of Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Turkish bey (governor) subordinate to the dey of Algiers. Salah Bey, who ruled the city in 1770–1792, greatly embellished it and built much of the Muslim architecture still visible today. During the Ottoman reign of Constantine, merchants traded a variety of goods such as; agricultural products, animals, embroidered textiles, leather, precious metals, swords, and pistols.

In 1826 the last bey, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif, became the new head of state. He led a fierce resistance against French forces, which invaded Algeria four years later. By 13 October 1837, the territory was captured by France, and from 1848 on until 1962 it was the centre of the Constantine Département. In 1880, while working in the military hospital in Constantine, Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that the cause of malaria is a protozoan. He observed the parasites in a blood smear taken from a soldier who had just died of malaria. For this, he received the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This was the first time that protozoa were shown to be a cause of disease. His work helped inspire researchers and veterinarians today to try to find a cure for malaria in animals.

In 1934, Muslim anti-Jewish riots, the 1934 Constantine Pogrom, caused the death of 23 local Jews and 3 local Muslims, 81 people were injured on both sides of the conflict.

During World War II, during the campaign in North Africa (1942–43), Allied forces used Constantine and the nearby cities of Sétif and Bone as operational bases.

== Geography ==
Constantine is situated on a plateau at an elevation above sea level. The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. The city is very picturesque with a number of bridges over Rhumel River and a viaduct crossing the ravine. The ravine is crossed by seven bridges, including Sidi M&#x27;Cid bridge. Constantine is the railhead of a prosperous and diverse agricultural area. It is also a centre of the grain trade and has flour mills, a tractor factory, and industries producing textiles, wool, linen and leather goods. Algeria and Tunisia serve as its markets.

=== Climate ===

Constantine has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.

== Main sights ==
The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. In 1911, Baedeker described it as &quot;resembling the Kasba of Algiers, the picturesque charm of which has so far been marred by the construction of but a few new streets.&quot;

=== The City of Bridges ===
The topography of the city is unique and it determines the need for bridges. At the end of the 19th century, Guy de Maupassant wrote: &quot;Eight bridges used to cross this ravine. Six of these bridges are in ruins today.&quot; Today the most important bridges are:

* Sidi M&#x27;Cid Bridge (1912), a suspension bridge with a length of 168m,
* Bab El Kantra Bridge (1792) bridge which leads toward north,
* Sidi Rached bridge (1912), a long viaduct of 447ms and 27 arches, designed by Paul Séjourné,
* Devil&#x27;s bridge, a tiny beam bridge,
* Falls bridge (1925), formed by a series of arches on top of a waterfall,
* Mellah Slimane Bridge (1925), a suspension bridge,
* Salah Bey Bridge (Trans-Rhummel viaduct, 2014), the first cable-stayed bridge in Constantine, designed by Dissing+Weitling architecture,

Emir Abdelkader University is one of the biggest Islamic universities with many faculties covering religious studies, foreign languages, and literature. Constantine&#x27;s new town &quot;nouvelle ville ali mendjeli&quot; has two big universities: Université Constantine 2 known as &quot;lella nsoumer&quot; offers maths, computer and economy majors, and the new university is actually a university pole with more than 20,000 students, 17 faculties and more than 40,000 residents. It is now the largest African university under the name of &quot;Université Salah Boubnider&quot; known as &quot;Université Constantine 3&quot;.

<doc id="468610" wikidata="Q453942" url="?curid=468610" title="Madeleine Kunin">
<text>Madeleine Kunin (née May; born September 28, 1933) is a Swiss-born American diplomat, author and politician. She served as the 77th governor of Vermont from 1985 until 1991, as a member of the Democratic Party. She also served as United States Ambassador to Switzerland from 1996 to 1999. She was Vermont&#x27;s first and, to date, only female governor as well as the first Jewish governor of Vermont. She was also the first Jewish woman to be elected governor of a U.S. state. Since 2003, Kunin has been a James Marsh Professor-at-Large at the University of Vermont. 

== Life and career ==
Kunin was born on September 28, 1933, in Zürich, Switzerland, the daughter of Renee (Bloch) and Ferdinand May. Her family were German Jews escaped to Switzerland after the Nazi rise.
Kunin&#x27;s father, Ferdinand May, suffered depression and died by suicide in a lake near Zurich.
She moved to the United States as a child. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1956), a master&#x27;s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and a master&#x27;s degree in English from the University of Vermont. Prior to seeking elective office, she worked as a journalist for &quot;The Burlington Free Press&quot;, as a tour guide at the World&#x27;s Fair, and as a part-time college professor. She was also involved in community activities, particularly in the area of women&#x27;s rights, children, and literature. In 2012 her book, &quot;The New Feminist Agenda: Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work, and Family&quot;, was published by Chelsea Green Publishing.

=== Political career ===
In 1972, Kunin was defeated in her bid to join the Burlington Board of Aldermen. Later that year she was elected a Vermont State Representative, where in her first term she served as a member of the Government Operations Committee. Following her reelection in 1974, she was elected Minority Whip of the State House and appointed to the Appropriations Committee. After being elected to a third term in 1976, she was appointed Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, the first woman to assume this position. Kunin has written that when she served on the Appropriations Committee during his chairmanship, Emory A. Hebard, a conservative Republican who later served as Vermont State Treasurer, was a mentor, and gave her significant responsibilities despite her status as a member of the minority Democrats. When Hebard left the House, he successfully lobbied his former colleagues to name Kunin as chairwoman of the committee.

In 1978 she was elected to the first of two terms as the 75th Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. Serving with Republican Richard A. Snelling, Kunin primarily served as President of the State Senate and worked with citizens around the state. She produced various studies in areas such as energy and daycare and made policy recommendations to the Governor and Legislature. Kunin was a frequent speaker statewide during her time as lieutenant governor.

Kunin did not run for reelection as lieutenant governor in 1982, instead challenging Snelling for the governorship. She was unsuccessful, but in 1984 Snelling did not run for reelection, and Kunin was the successful Democratic nominee, defeating Republican John J. Easton Jr. to win the first of her three terms as governor.

In 1986 Kunin ran for her second term as governor. Her opponents were Republican Peter Plympton Smith and independent Bernie Sanders. Smith received 38 percent of the vote, Sanders 14 percent, and Kunin won with 47 percent of the vote.

She is the first woman in U.S. history to have been elected governor of a U.S. state three times. As governor, she focused on the environment, education, and children&#x27;s issues. She appointed the first woman to the Vermont Supreme Court and created her state&#x27;s family court system. After rising unpopularity due to significant budget cuts and economic downturn within the State, Kunin declined to seek reelection in 1990.

She was a member of the administration of President Bill Clinton, serving as deputy secretary of education of the United States from 1993 until 1997 when she became the ambassador to her native Switzerland, as well as to Liechtenstein. Prior to joining the Clinton Administration, she worked in Clinton&#x27;s campaign as a member of the search committee for the vice presidential nominee and on the transition team.
Switzerland-United States relations entered a tense phase during the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks starting in 1995. 
The U.S. federal government adopted a delicate policy of supporting the heirs of the Holocaust victims, while formally opposing sanctions against Switzerland. Ultimately, the Swiss banks agreed to a 1.25 billion dollar settlement with Holocaust survivors and their heirs in 1998. Furthermore, in the wake of the lawsuit, the Swiss government established steps to re-evaluate the role of Switzerland during World War II.
One of the steps taken was the publication of the names of the owners of dormant accounts in Swiss banks, with the surprise result that Renee May, Kunin&#x27;s mother deceased in 1970 was among the names.

== Personal life ==
Kunin is the author of the books &quot;Coming of Age: My Journey to the Eighties&quot; (2018), &quot;The New Feminist Agenda: Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work, and Family&quot; (2012), &quot; Pearls, Politics, and Power: How Women Can Win and Lead&quot; (2008) and &quot;Living a Political Life&quot; (1995) which chronicles her career prior to joining the U.S. Department of Education. She is a resident of Burlington, Vermont.

Kunin is the mother of four children, including her daughter Julia Kunin. She divorced her first husband, the academic Arthur Kunin, in 1995. She married John W. Hennessey Jr., a professor at Dartmouth College, in 2006.

Kunin was the sister of the late Edgar May, who was a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and a member of both the Vermont House of Representatives and Vermont State Senate.

== Awards and honors ==
Governor Kunin has received more than twenty honorary degrees.

In 1995, Kunin received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in recognition of her support for education, equal access for all children and equitable salaries for teachers.

==Early life and education==
Mickelson was born in Mobridge, South Dakota. His grandfather was a Norwegian immigrant. His parents, George Theodore Mickelson and Madge Mickelson, were the Governor and First Lady of South Dakota from 1947 to 1951.

Mickelson graduated from the University of South Dakota with a bachelor&#x27;s in business administration in 1963 and from the University of South Dakota School of Law in 1965. He was a brother in Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity at USD. He served in the United States Army, including a tour of duty in Vietnam. He married Linda McCahren and they had three children, Amy, David and Mark.

==Public service and plane crash==
Mickelson served as South Dakota State Assistant Attorney General (1967–68) and South Dakota State Attorney, Brookings County (1971–74). First elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1974, he held office there for six years, serving as Speaker for the final two years. Mickelson was elected governor in 1986 and reelected four years later.
On April 19, 1993, Mickelson was one of eight people aboard a state-owned airplane returning to South Dakota from a lobbying effort in Ohio. The plane, a Mitsubishi MU-2 turboprop, reported engine trouble while flying near Dubuque, Iowa, and crashed into a farm silo about four miles south of Zwingle. Everyone on the plane was killed. Mickelson was succeeded as governor by then-Lieutenant Governor Walter Dale Miller. The crash happened on the same day as the end of the Waco siege, which overshadowed it in national news coverage.

==Legacy==
George S. Mickelson Middle School in Brookings is named after him, as is the George S. Mickelson Trail in the Black Hills and the George S. Mickelson Center for the Neurosciences in Yankton, South Dakota. The George S. Mickelson Education Center at Southeast Technical Institute in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was built in 1990. The George S. Mickelson Great Service Award is given out annually by the South Dakota Office of Tourism. His alma mater, the University of South Dakota, awards academically talented South Dakota students with high ACTs/SATs a full-tuition scholarship known as the George S. Mickelson Scholarship. It is the university&#x27;s most prestigious scholarship.

<doc id="468620" wikidata="Q1153387" url="?curid=468620" title="Ordinary Time">
<text>Ordinary Time () is the part of the liturgical year in the liturgy of the Roman Rite, which falls outside the two great seasons of Christmastide and Eastertide, or their respective preparatory seasons of Advent and Lent. Ordinary Time thus includes the days between Christmastide and Lent, and between Eastertide and Advent. The liturgical color assigned to Ordinary Time is green. The last Sunday of Ordinary Time is the Solemnity of Christ the King.

The word &quot;ordinary&quot; as used here comes from the ordinal numerals by which the weeks are identified or counted, from the 1st week of Ordinary Time in January to the 34th week that begins toward the end of November.

== Roman Rite ==
In the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, the last day of Christmas Time is the Sunday after the Solemnity of the Epiphany, or the Sunday after January 6 in places where Epiphany is moved to always occur on a Sunday. Ordinary Time begins the following Monday, and the weekdays that follow are reckoned as belonging to the first week of Ordinary Time. The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is usually celebrated on the last day of Christmas Time, but if it is displaced to Monday due to Epiphany being celebrated on January 7 or 8, the Feast of the Baptism falls in Ordinary Time instead.

Because Ordinary Time begins on a Monday, there is no day called the &quot;First Sunday in Ordinary Time&quot;. Instead, the lowest-numbered Sunday is called the Second Sunday in Ordinary Time. This block of Ordinary Time continues through the Tuesday that immediately precedes Ash Wednesday.

Ordinary Time resumes on the Monday after the Solemnity of Pentecost. The two Sundays following Pentecost are the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity and the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, which despite being part of Ordinary Time, are not numbered. In regional calendars where Whitmonday is a Day of Obligation, Ordinary Time and the use of the liturgical colour Green may begin on the following Tuesday.

The last day of Ordinary Time is the day before the First Sunday of Advent. The last Sunday of Ordinary Time is the Solemnity of Christ the King, with the Sunday before that being the Thirty-Third Sunday in Ordinary Time, with the ordinal numbers counting backwards from that point. 

Due to the configuration of the calendar year, Ordinary Time may have a total of either 33 or 34 weeks. As a mnemonic, if the First Sunday of Advent is in November, the previous liturgical year&#x27;s Ordinary Time will have 33 weeks. If it falls on December 2 or 3, it will have 34 weeks. However, if it falls on December 1, the previous year&#x27;s Ordinary Time will have 34 weeks only when it is a leap year. In a year where Ordinary Time has 33 weeks, the omitted week is the one between the weeks immediately surrounding Lent and Easter Time, which varies with the date of Easter. This is because the weeks always count forward from the first week at the beginning of Ordinary Time, and separately backwards from the thirty-fourth week at the end of Ordinary Time.

The decision to treat the whole of Ordinary Time as a unit led to abandonment of the previous terminology, whereby the Sundays of the first period were called Sundays after Epiphany and those of the second period Sundays after Pentecost.

=== Solemnities, feasts and commemorations ===
The celebration of an Ordinary Time weekday gives way to that of any solemnity, feast, or obligatory memorial that falls on the same day, and may optionally be replaced by that of a non-obligatory memorial or of any saint mentioned in the Roman Martyrology for that day.

The solemnities, feasts, and commemorations of the General Roman Calendar which may, according to the Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite, replace a Sunday of the Ordinary time are: 
* Feast of the Presentation of the Lord on 2 February 
* Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity on the Sunday after Pentecost 
* Solemnity of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist on 24 June
* Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June
* Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord on 6 August
* Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 15 August
* Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September
* Solemnity of All Saints on 1 November
* Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed on 2 November
* Feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome on 9 November

The Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar also lists as proper solemnities (which outrank in the relevant church building or community Sundays in Ordinary Time):
* The Solemnity of the principal patron of the place, city, or state
* The Solemnity of the dedication and the anniversary of the dedication of one&#x27;s own church
* The Solemnity of the title of one&#x27;s own church
* The Solemnity either of the title or of the founder or of the principal Patron of an Order or Congregation.

== Revised Common Lectionary usage ==

Following the lead of the liturgical reforms of the Roman Rite, many Protestant churches also adopted the concept of an &quot;Ordinary Time&quot; alongside the Revised Common Lectionary, which applies the term to the period between Pentecost and Advent. However, use of the term is not common.

Those that have adopted the Revised Common Lectionary include churches of the Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, Old Catholic and Reformed traditions.

Some Protestant denominations set off a time at the end of Ordinary Time known as Kingdomtide or Season of End Times. This period can range anywhere from only the three Sundays prior to Christ the King (as in the Wisconsin Synod Lutheran) to 13 or 14 weeks (most notably in the United Methodist Church). The Church of England observes this time between All Saints and Advent Sunday.

In some traditions, what in the Roman Rite is the first period of Ordinary Time is called Epiphanytide (beginning on Epiphany Day in the Anglican Communion and Methodist churches) and from Trinity Sunday to Advent is called Trinitytide. In the Church of England, Sundays during &quot;Ordinary Time&quot; in this narrower sense are called &quot;Sundays after Trinity&quot;, except the final four, which are termed &quot;Sundays before Advent&quot;. In the Episcopal Church (United States), it is normal to refer to Sundays after Epiphany and Sundays after Pentecost (not Trinity).

The total number of Sundays varies according to the date of Easter and can range anything from 18 to 23. When there are 23, the Collect and Post-Communion for the 22nd Sunday are taken from the provision for the Third Sunday before Lent.

<doc id="468624" wikidata="Q399974" url="?curid=468624" title="Interstate 105 (California)">
<text>Interstate 105 (I-105) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Greater Los Angeles urban area of Southern California. It runs from State Route[[Interstate 105 (California)| ]]1 (SR1) near El Segundo and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Studebaker Road in the City of Norwalk. It is commonly known as the Century Freeway after Century Boulevard which it parallels, and also officially known as the Glenn Anderson Freeway after the late congressman Glenn M. Anderson who advocated for its construction.

==Route description==
The entirety of I-105 is designated as Route 105 in the state highway system. The California Streets and Highways Code defines it as such in section 405:
Route 105 is from Pershing Drive near El Segundo to Route 605.

Route 105 was never fully constructed as it is defined. Currently, the western terminus of I-105 is at Sepulveda Boulevard (SR 1) and Imperial Highway on the southern edge of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), near the El Segundo–Los Angeles line. Motorists can still continue west via Imperial Highway over conventional roadway to Pershing Drive, but it is not part of Route 105 nor does Caltrans have any intention to adopt the road as part of the state highway system or construct an extension of I-105 over it. A portion of undeveloped land south of this section of Imperial Highway exists to facilitate a potential extension of the freeway. 

East of Sepulveda Boulevard, I-105 intersects with I-405 (San Diego Freeway) at the Lennox–Hawthorne line, then continues east near the northern city limits of Hawthorne and the southern city limits of Inglewood. Upon reaching the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles, I-105 intersects with I-110 at the five-level Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange. I-105 continues east into Willowbrook before entering the city of Lynwood, where it has a four-level interchange with I-710 and crosses the Los Angeles River. I-105 then runs through Paramount before entering Downey. In Downey, I-105 intersects with Lakewood Boulevard (SR 19). I-105 then enters Norwalk, where it intersects with I-605, crosses the San Gabriel River, and then terminates at an at-grade intersection with Studebaker Road.

The freeway never intersects its parent route, I-5. I-105 complies with numbering conventions by intersecting other auxiliary routes of I-5 that do intersect I-5, namely I-405 and I-605.

Much of the length of the Century Freeway runs parallel to Imperial Highway. It also runs parallel to (and south of) Century Boulevard, from which its original name is derived. Century Boulevard, in turn, is named for its position equivalent to 100th Street in the Los Angeles grid.

The Los Angeles Metro Rail C Line runs in the median of nearly the entire length of I-105. The C Line&#x27;s eastern terminus is at Norwalk, at the interchange between I-105 and I-605. from the western end of the freeway, the C Line separates onto its own right-of-way at Aviation Boulevard before turning north towards the LAX area, where a future people mover connecting Metro Rail to airport terminals is scheduled to open in 2026. 

I-105 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

===Early planning===
I-105 was an integral part of a Caltrans 1960s master plan for the Southern California freeway system, but did not open until 1993. The right-of-way was included on several early highway plans since at least 1947, although it was not named the &quot;Century Freeway&quot; until 1956, and was numbered Route 42. In 1965, the Century Freeway was added to the state system originated at State Route 1 (Sepulveda Boulevard) east to Central Avenue in the City of Los Angeles along an alignment very near to the current right-of-way. The current route was added to the Interstate system in 1968.

===Design and local opposition===
The route was designed between 1968 and 1972 by Caltrans District 7, under the direction of Design Chief Sid Elicks. However, opposition from some of the communities through which the right-of-way would pass slowed the process and led to some reroutings. Many factors contributed to the delay. The growth of the environmental movement in the 1960s created resistance to new freeway construction. Fiscal difficulties brought about by the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the California tax revolt of the late 1970s further hampered Caltrans&#x27; construction efforts.

The major source of resistance to the freeway&#x27;s construction was community opposition and the side effects of these demands. By the early 1970s, most of the areas in the freeway&#x27;s path (and thus slated to be demolished) were predominantly African-American. Resentment over previous freeway projects&#x27; effects on other black communities resulted in significant modifications to the original route. Most cities along the way, weary of the noise and visual blight created by elevated freeways, demanded that the route be built far below grade in a &quot;trench&quot;. Also, another source for resistance to the freeway&#x27;s construction was that much of the I-105 path was going to be built in low income, high crime neighborhoods, which also delayed the freeway&#x27;s construction until the crime in the areas went down.

Norwalk was opposed to the freeway&#x27;s proposed route through its city center, and blocked the freeway from reaching its intended terminus at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5); however, Caltrans had already decided to abandon that section due to the inability of the severely congested Santa Ana Freeway to accommodate any more traffic.

===&quot;Keith v. Volpe&quot;===
In 1972, community opposition resulted in a federal lawsuit, &quot;Keith v. Volpe,&quot; being filed, charging a violation of various civil rights protections and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). An important figure in the freeway&#x27;s history was Harry Pregerson, a United States federal judge who presided over the lawsuit concerning the freeway&#x27;s construction and chose to continue presiding over the case despite being promoted to a higher level court. The interchange with I-110 is named the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange in his honor. In 1972, Judge Pregerson enjoined the further development of the freeway until it has complied with the requirements of NEPA, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Federal-Aid Highway Act, and the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970.

In 1979, this lawsuit resulted in a Consent Decree, amended in 1981, which imposed several conditions on the development of the freeway, including additional public hearings, preparation of an environmental report, alterations to the design to reduce lanes and intersections, improve carpooling and provide for a transitway, which became the Los Angeles Metro Rail Green Line, now known as the C Line. A portion of the right-of-way was also to be constructed below grade to buffer adjacent areas from the effects of traffic noise. After construction began in the 1980s, failure to perform a complete survey of the area&#x27;s groundwater deposits, combined with the below-grade trench through the city of Downey, resulted in buckling and cracking along the eastern portions of the route. At one point, a giant sinkhole opened in the Bellflower Boulevard on-ramp. This resulted in the construction of an elaborate pump system along the freeway between the interchanges with I-710 and I-605.

===Century Freeway Housing Program===
A significant aspect of the &quot;Keith v. Volpe&quot; Consent Decree was the requirement that the housing removed to construct the freeway be replaced, leading to the creation of the Century Freeway Housing Program within the California Department of Housing and Community Development.

====Notable demolished homes and buildings====

The childhood home of Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys was demolished in the mid-1980s to make way for the freeway, as was the house across the street where their bandmate David Marks grew up. In 2005, the Beach Boys Historic Landmark was built on the former site of the Wilson brothers&#x27; home and declared a California Historic Landmark.

The birthplace of Metallica, former bassist Ron McGovney&#x27;s house, stood directly in the path of the route nearby to I-605 in Downey.

Another home in Downey, California, where siblings Richard and Karen Carpenter grew up before forming the musical duo the Carpenters, was also razed for I-105.

===Post-construction===
Throughout the difficulties, Congressman Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) tirelessly advocated for the route&#x27;s construction, making claims it would provide congestion relief along Century, Manchester, and Firestone Boulevards and the Imperial Highway, as well as relieving pressure on the Santa Monica (I-10) and San Diego (I-405) Freeways for travelers between Downtown Los Angeles and LAX. After Anderson&#x27;s death in 1994, Caltrans honored him by renaming the freeway in his honor. The route&#x27;s original name, &quot;Century Freeway&quot;, is still used on a number of maps.

The freeway was originally signed with El Segundo as its westbound control city; however, in recent years, many of the El Segundo signs have been replaced and/or covered with &quot;LAX Airport&quot; signage due to the western terminus&#x27; proximity to Los Angeles International Airport.

Shortly before opening, filmmakers had access to use the empty freeway for a number of weeks to film the 1994 motion picture &quot;Speed&quot;.

===Interstate 105 (1964–68)===
Previously, the I-105 designation was used for U.S. Route 101 (the Santa Ana Freeway, US 101) from I-5 (the Golden State Freeway) at the East Los Angeles Interchange to the connection to I-10 (the San Bernardino Freeway; this connection had been I-110); it went back to US 101 in 1968.

<text>Edison Vasilievich Denisov (, 6 April 1929 – 24 November 1996) was a Russian composer in the so-called &quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;nonconformist&quot; division of Soviet music.

==Biography==

Denisov was born in Tomsk, Siberia. He studied mathematics before deciding to spend his life composing. This decision was enthusiastically supported by Dmitri Shostakovich, who gave him lessons in composition.

In 1951–56 Denisov studied at the Moscow Conservatory: composition with Vissarion Shebalin, orchestration with Nikolai Rakov, analysis with Viktor Tsukkerman and piano with Vladimir Belov. In 1956–59 he composed the opera &quot;Ivan-Soldat&quot; (Soldier Ivan) in three acts based on Russian folk fairy tales.

He began his own study of scores that were difficult to obtain in the USSR at that time, including music by composers ranging from Mahler and Debussy to Boulez and Stockhausen. He wrote a series of articles giving a detailed analysis of different aspects of contemporary compositional techniques and at same time actively experimented as a composer, trying to find his own way.

After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he taught orchestration and later composition there. His pupils included the composers Dmitri Smirnov, Elena Firsova, Dilorom Saidaminova, Vladimir Tarnopolsky, Sergey Pavlenko, Ivan Sokolov, Yuri Kasparov. He supported and encouraged Dmitri Capyrin and Alexander Shchetynsky who have never been his pupils. 

In 1979, at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers, he was blacklisted as one of &quot;Khrennikov&#x27;s Seven&quot; for unapproved participation in a number of festivals of Soviet music in the West.

Denisov became a leader of the Association for Contemporary Music reestablished in Moscow in 1990. Later he moved to France, where after an accident and long illness he died in a Saint-Mandé hospital in 1996.

==Music==
Denisov&#x27;s cycle for soprano and chamber ensemble &quot;Le soleil des Incas&quot; (1964), setting poems by Gabriela Mistral and dedicated to Pierre Boulez, brought him international recognition following a series of successful performances of the work in Darmstadt and Paris (1965). Igor Stravinsky liked the piece, discovering the &quot;remarkable talent&quot; of its composer. However, it was harshly criticised by the Union of Soviet Composers for its &quot;western influences&quot;, &quot;erudition instead of creativity&quot;, and &quot;total composer&#x27;s arbitrary&quot; (Tikhon Khrennikov). After that, performances of his works were frequently banned in the Soviet Union.

Later he wrote a flute concerto for Aurèle Nicolet, a violin concerto for Gidon Kremer, works for the oboist Heinz Holliger, clarinettist Eduard Brunner and a sonata for alto saxophone and piano for Jean-Marie Londeix, that became highly popular among saxophone players.

His sombre but striking Requiem, setting a multi-lingual text (English, French, German, and Latin) based on works by the German writer Francisco Tanzer, was given its first performance in Hamburg in 1980.

Among his major works are the operas &quot;L&#x27;écume des jours&quot; after Boris Vian (1981), &quot;Quatre Filles&quot; after Pablo Picasso (1986) and ballet &quot;Confession&quot; after Alfred de Musset.

<doc id="468629" wikidata="Q758195" url="?curid=468629" title="Attic calendar">
<text>The Attic calendar or Athenian calendar is the lunisolar calendar beginning in midsummer with the lunar month of Hekatombaion, in use in ancient Attica, the ancestral territory of the Athenian polis. It is sometimes called the Greek calendar because of Athens&#x27;s cultural importance, but it is only one of many ancient Greek calendars.

Although relatively abundant, the evidence for the Attic calendar is still patchy and often contested. As it was well known in Athens and of little use outside Attica, no contemporary source set out to describe the system as a whole. Further, even during the well-sourced 5th and 4th centuries BC, the calendar underwent changes, not all perfectly understood. As such, any account given of it must be a tentative reconstruction.

==Local focus==
The Attic calendar was an exclusively local phenomenon, used to regulate the internal affairs of the Athenians, with little relevance to the outside world. For example, just across the border in Boeotia, the months had different names, and the year even began in midwinter. In Athens, the year began six months later, just after midsummer. Furthermore, while Greek months were supposed to begin with the first sighting of the new moon, it was determined locally and with a degree of variability. In many years, the months in the two communities would have more or less coincided, but there is no sign that they tried to keep the days of the month exactly aligned, as they would have seen no reason to do so.

The divide between these neighbouring calendars perhaps reflected the traditional hostility between the two communities. Had the Boeotians been speakers of an Ionic dialect, the one spoken in Athens, there would have been overlap in the names of months. An example is the island of Delos, where the calendar shared four out of twelve month-names with Athens, but not in the same places in the year. There, even though the island was under some degree of Athenian control from around 479 to 314 BC, the year started, as with the Boeotians, at midwinter.

==More than one calendar==
Athenians lived under a number of simultaneous calendars that were used to fix days for different purposes. How much each calendar meant to individuals probably depended on how they lived. They may be set out as follows:

* A lunisolar festival calendar of 12 months based on the cycle of the moon and accommodating the solar year
* A democratic state calendar of 10 arbitrary months
* An agricultural calendar of seasons using star risings to fix points in time

===Festival calendar (lunisolar)===

====Intercalation====
The year was meant to begin with the first sighting of the new moon after the summer solstice. Ideally, the solstice would occur toward the end of Skirophorion, the final month of the year. 

The new year would then begin on the day after the first sliver of the new moon was seen (or presumed to be seen). However, because the relation of these two events, solstice and new moon, is variable, the date of the new year (in relation to a Gregorian date) could move by up to a month.

This linking of solar and lunar years defines the calendar as lunisolar. Because 12 lunar months are approximately 11 days shorter than a solar year, using a purely lunar calendar (such as the Islamic one) removes any relation between the months and the seasons, causing the months to creep backwards over the seasons. By tying the start of their year to the summer solstice Athenians forced the months to relate, with some elasticity, to the seasons.

In order to deal with the 11-day difference between 12 lunar months and 1 solar cycle, when it was judged that the months had slid back enough (roughly every three years), an extra month was inserted (&quot;intercalated&quot;), leading to a leap year with about 384 days in it. The extra month was achieved by repeating an existing month so that the same month name was used twice in a row. The sixth month, Poseideon, is most frequently mentioned as the month that was repeated; however months 1, 2, 7, and 8 (Hekatombaiōn, Metageitniōn, Gameliōn, and Anthesteriōn) are also attested as being doubled.

Various cycles were in existence for working out exactly which years needed to add a thirteenth month. A nineteen-year cycle, the Metonic cycle, was developed in Athens by the astronomers Meton and Euctemon (known to be active in 432 BC), could have been used to pattern the insertion of leap years to keep the lunar and solar years aligned with some accuracy. There is, however, no sign that any such system was in fact used in Athens, whose calendar seems to have been administered on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.&lt;br&gt;

====Names of months====
The first function of this calendar was to set the days for the religious festivals. In a county fair role, they encompassed a much broader range of activities than the word &quot;religious&quot; suggests and were central to the life of the city.

The Athenian months were named after gods and festivals. In this the calendar differed from the Mesopotamian models that lie behind all Greek lunar calendars. In the Sumerian and Babylonian prototypes, for instance, the months were named after the main agricultural activity practised in that month. Many Athenian festivals had links with different stages of the agricultural cycle, such as festivals of planting or harvest. It perhaps added to the need to keep lunar and solar calendars roughly aligned, though this was not always achieved. The farming year, however, was not the primary focus of the calendar.

At Athens month 6, Poseideon, took its name directly from the god Poseidon. More commonly, the god appears in the form of a cult title. (A cult title is the name or aspect under which a god was worshipped at a particular festival.) Examples are Maimakterion, named after Zeus (&quot;the rager&quot;) and Metageitnion, after Apollo as helper of colonists.

Of all of the months, only the eighth, Anthesterion, was named directly after the major festival celebrated in its month, the Anthesteria. While the month-naming festivals of Pyanepsia, Thargelia and Skira were relatively important, some of the grandest celebrations in the life of the city are not recognised in the name of the month. Examples are the Great Dionysia held in Elaphebolion (month 9) and the Panathenaia are only indirectly recognised in Hekatombaion (month 1), named after the &quot;hekatombe&quot;, the sacrifice of a &quot;hundred oxen&quot; held on the final night of the Panathenaia. More often than not, the festival providing the month name is minor or obsolete. For instance, the second month, Metageitnion, is named after a cult title of the god Apollo, but there is no trace of a festival bearing the name. The same goes for months 5 and 6, Maimakterion and Poseideon.

The calendars of the Ionian cities of Asia Minor (along the western coastline of modern Turkey) often share month names with Athens. For instance, at Miletos four of the same month names were in use, namely Thargelion, Metageitnion, Boedromion and Pyanepsion, and the last of these even occupied the same position as month four in both communities. Traditionally, these Ionian cities were founded by colonists from Attica (perhaps around 1050 BC). It may be then that the Athenian month names refer to a festival schedule some hundreds of years out of date.

=====List of months=====
The correlation suggested here between the Athenian months and those of the modern (Gregorian) calendar is loose, and, in some years, it might have been off by over a month.

====Days of the month====
The months were 29 or 30 days in length, loosely in alternation, since the Moon orbits the Earth in roughly 29.5 days. However, rather than following a set scheme (such as the popular rhyme &quot;Thirty days hath September...&quot;), the duration of each month was declared just before month&#x27;s end in an attempt to latch the first of the following month onto the upcoming new moon. The short months of 29 days were known as &quot;hollow&quot; and the ones with 30 days as &quot;full&quot;.

Each month was divided into three phases of ten days associated with the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. The naming of the days was complex. The first day of the month was simply &quot;noumenia&quot; or new moon, a name used in virtually every Greek calendar. From there the days were numbered up to the 20th day. For the final third of the month the numbering turned around to do a countdown from ten to the last day. Only the middle phase had numbers for the days running higher than 10 and even these were often phrased as &quot;the third over ten&quot; and so forth. In the wings of the month, the numbered days ran 2–10 and then 10–2. Days in these sections were distinguished from each other by adding the participle &quot;waxing&quot; and &quot;waning&quot; to the month name. In the centre of the month with its unambiguous numbering there was no need for this, though later the term &quot;of the middling month&quot; was used. The final day of the month was called &quot;henē kai nea&quot;, &quot;the old and the new&quot;. Peculiar to Athens, this name presents the day as bridging the two moons or months. Elsewhere in Greece this day was usually called the 30th.

Athenian festivals were divided between the 80 or so annually recurring celebrations and a set of monthly holy days clustered around the beginning of each month. They were often the birthdays of gods, the Greeks thinking of birthdays as a monthly rather than a yearly recurrence. Every month, days 1–4 and 6–8 were all sacred to particular gods or divine entities, amounting to some 60 days a year:

*Day 1: New Moon, Noumenia.
*Day 2: Agathos Daimon
*Day 3: Athena&#x27;s Birthday
*Day 4: Heracles, Hermes, Aphrodite and Eros
*Day 6: Artemis&#x27; Birthday
*Day 7: Apollo&#x27;s Birthday
*Day 8: Poseidon and Theseus

Monthly and annual festivals were not usually allowed to fall on the same days so every festival month had an opening phase with exactly recurrent practices and celebrations while in the body of each month was a unique schedule of festival days.

A parallel function of this calendar was the positioning of the perhaps 15 or so forbidden days on which business should not be transacted.

Rather than considering the month as a simple duration of thirty days, the three-part numbering scheme focuses on the Moon itself. In particular the waning days 10–2 and the waxing days 2–10 frame the crucial moment where the moon vanishes and then reappears.

A date under this scheme might be &quot;the third (day) of Thargelion waning&quot;, meaning the 28th day of Thargelion.

To summarise the days with special names.
* The first day: &quot;noumenia&quot;, or new moon.
* The last day: &quot;henē kai nea&quot;, the &quot;old and the new&quot;.
* The 21st day: &quot;the later tenth&quot;. The Attic month had three days named &quot;tenth&quot; (equivalent in a straight sequence to the 10th, 20th, and 21st days). These were distinguished as
**10th: &quot;the tenth (of the month) waxing&quot;
**20th: &quot;the earlier tenth&quot; (i.e. waning)
**21st: &quot;the later tenth&quot; (i.e. waning)
This strange juxtapositioning of the two days called the tenth, the earlier and the later, further highlighted the shift into the moon&#x27;s waning phase.

When a month was to last 29 instead of 30 days (a &quot;hollow&quot; month), the last day of the month (&quot;the old and new&quot;) was pulled back by one day. That is to say, the &quot;second day of the waning month&quot; (the 29th in straight sequence) was renamed as month&#x27;s end.

===State calendar===
As Ionians, the Athenians had always been divided into four tribes. Although the tribes were never abolished, one of the key reforms at the creation of democracy after 506 BC was to distribute citizens under a new system of ten tribes to try to ensure even participation across the whole community. From then on, ten became a kind of hallmark number for the democracy, as so much citizen activity was done through the ten tribes. (For instance, the 10 generals leading the 10 regiments, the 10 sets of public arbitrators, the 10 treasurers of the Delian league and so on.)

This decimal ordering extended to the creation of a supplementary calendar with ten months. Each year, each tribe contributed 50 members to the council of 500 (boule), which played an important role in the administration of the city. For one tenth of the year, each tribal fifty was on duty, with a third of them in the council chamber at all times as an executive committee for the state. Their period of office was known as a &#x27;prytany&#x27; or state month.

In the 5th century, the calendar was solar-based by using a year of 365 or 366 days and paying no attention at all to the phases of the moon. One likely arrangement is that the ten prytanies were divided between six months of 37 days followed by four months of 36 days. That would be parallel to the arrangement in the 4th century explained below.

From several synchronized datings that survive, it is evident that the political and the festival years did not have to begin or end on the same days. The political new year is attested 15 days either way from the start of the festival year. The system is known from the 420s; whether it had been in place from the beginning of the ten-month system is not clear.

However, in 407 BC the two calendars were synchronized to start and end on the same days. Hereafter as described in the 4th century &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot; the civic year was arranged as follows:
* Months 1–4 lasted 36 days (39 in leap years?)
* Months 5–10 lasted 35 days (38 in leap years?)

In years with an extra month intercalated into the festival calendar, the political months were probably lengthened to 39 and 38 days, a method that would have maintained the balance between the tribes. Evidence, however, is lacking.

In the Macedonian period (307/306 – 224/223 BC), with twelve tribes (and the prytanies), evidence shows that the month and the prytany were not coterminous and that, in general, the six first prytanies had 30 days and the last six had 29 days and that in an intercalary year, the 384 days are equally subdivided. (Meritt, 1961: Ch.VI)

In the Thirteen Phylai period (224/223 – 201/200 BC), it would be expected that in an intercalary year prytanies and months must have been fairly evenly matched and that in an ordinary year, the conciliar year was made up of three prytanies of 28 days followed by ten prytanies of 27 days, but there is strong evidence that the first prytany had usually 27 days. (Meritt, 1961: Ch.VII)

The political months had no name but were numbered and given in conjunction with the name of the presiding tribe (which, as determined by lot at the expiry of their predecessors&#x27; term, gave no clue as to the time of year). The days were numbered with a straightforward sequence, running from 1 to the total number of days for that month.

One of the main roles of the civic calendar was to position the four assembly meetings to be held each prytany. If possible, assembly meetings were not held on festival days, including the monthly festival days clustered at the start of each month. As a result, the meetings were bunched slightly toward the end of the month and made to dodge especially the larger festivals.

A date under this calendar might run &quot;the 33rd day in the 3rd prytany, that of the tribe Erechtheis&quot;, the style used in Athenian state documents (surviving only as inscriptions). Sometimes, however, a dating in terms of the festival calendar is added as well.

====Manipulation====
The Attic calendar was determined on the ground, month by month and year by year, in the light of immediate concerns, political or military. It was in the control of magistrates, who were not astronomers. How heavyhanded the interference was is controversial. Some scholars believe that if a festival date fell on a day needed for an assembly meeting, an extra day could be inserted by simply repeating the same day name.

There is clear evidence that it was done later. In Athens in 271 BC, just before the Great Dionysia, four days were inserted between Elaphebolion 9 and 10, putting the calendar on hold. Presumably, it was to gain extra rehearsal time for the festival with its performances of tragedy and comedy. A similar story comes from the 5th century BC but at Argos: the Argives, launching a punitive expedition in the shadow of the holy month of Karneios when fighting was banned, decided to freeze the calendar to add some extra days of war. However, their allies rejected the rearrangement and went home.

Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Clouds&quot;, a comedy from 423 BC, contains a speech whose complaint is brought from the Moon: the Athenians have been playing round with the months, &quot;running them up and down&quot; so that human activity and the divine order are completely out of kilter: &quot;When you should be holding sacrifices, instead you are torturing and judging.&quot; A situation is known to have applied in the 2nd century BC, when the festival calendar was so out of sync with the actual cycles of the moon that the lunisolar date was sometimes given under two headings, one &quot;according to the god&quot;, apparently the Moon, and the other &quot;according to the archon&quot;, the festival calendar itself.

A third calendar regulating Athenian lives was solar or seasonal. As such, it was fundamental for seasonal activities like farming and sailing. Within the broad divisions of the seasons, it relied on star risings and settings to mark more precise points in time. Star risings are the days when particular stars or constellations that have been below the horizon during hours of darkness first appear after sunset. Different star risings were keyed to various farm tasks, such as when to harvest: Hesiod in the &quot;Works and Days&quot; urges the farmer to harvest when the Pleiades rises (an event which elsewhere is set to mark the end of spring). Such a system was part of general Greek tradition, but fitted to local geography and conditions. Hesiod also uses the rising of Arcturus to mark the ending of winter and marks the start of Spring with the coming of the sparrows.

The seasons were not viewed by Greeks as dividing the year into four even blocks but rather spring and autumn were shorter tail sections of the overarching seasons, summer and winter. The divisions could be formalised by using star risings or settings in relation to the equinoxes: for instance, winter is defined in one medical text as the period between the setting of the Pleiades and the spring.

The older tradition as seen in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; was extended by astronomical research to the creation of star calendars known as &quot;parapegmas&quot;. They were stone or wooden tablets listing a sequence of astronomical events, each with a peg hole beside it. Lines of bare peg holes were used to count the &quot;empty days&quot; between what were taken as the significant celestial events. Often set up in town squares (agoras), the tablets put the progression of the year on public display.

This system would have been fundamental to an individual&#x27;s sense of the advancing year, but it barely intersected with the festival or state calendars. They were more civic in character and required managing to maintain their coherence with the year of the seasons. The seasonal and sidereal calendar, on the other hand, was immune to interference so Thucydides could date by the rising of Arcturus without having to wade into the confusion of disconnected city-state calendars.
==Dating events==
The modern calendar, as well as regulating the immediate year, is part of a system of chronology that allows events to be dated far into the future and the past so a given date includes day, month and year.

By contrast, the Attic calendar had little interest in ordering the sequence of years. As in other Greek cities, the name of one of the yearly magistrates, at Athens known as the eponymous archon, was used to identify the year in relation to others. The sequence of years was matched to a list of names that could be consulted. Instead of citing a numbered year, one could locate a year in time by saying that some event occurred &quot;when X. was archon&quot;. That allowed the years to be ordered back in time for a number of generations into the past, but there was no way of dating forward beyond ordinary human reckoning (as in expressions such as &quot;ten years from now&quot;).

There was, for instance, no use of a century divided into decades. A four-year cycle was important, which must have helped structure a sense of the passing years: at Athens, the festival of the Panathenaia was celebrated on a grander scale every fourth year as the Great Panathenaia, but that was not used as the basis of a dating system.

As both narrowly local and cyclical in focus then, the calendar did not provide a means for dating events in a comprehensible way between cities. A dating system using the four-yearly Olympiads was devised by the Greek Sicilian historian Timaeus (born c. 350 BC) as a tool for historical research, but it was probably never important on a local level.

<text>Verizon is an American wireless network operator that previously operated as a separate division of Verizon Communications under the name Verizon Wireless. In a 2019 reorganization, Verizon moved the wireless products and services into the divisions Verizon Consumer and Verizon Business, and stopped using the Verizon Wireless name. Verizon is the largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 146 million subscribers as of December 31, 2024. It currently has the second-largest network in the United States with their LTE network covering 2.68 million sq. miles of the United States.

The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone. Verizon Communications became the sole owner in 2014 after buying Vodafone&#x27;s 45-percent stake in the company.

It operates national 5G and 4G LTE networks covering about 99 percent of the U.S. population, which in the first half of 2024 won top honors in five out of eight categories of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports, along with the most awards in both state and metro testing. Notably, Verizon won the United States Overall and Data RootScore Awards outright, along with outright wins for accessibility and video performance. Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices. Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties. Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth-generation, network. In 2020, 230 million people were able to access Verizon&#x27;s 5G, or fifth-generation, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology network; by 2024, 250 million people were covered by Verizon&#x27;s 5G Ultra Wideband network.

==History==

In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and British-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion. The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic–GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic–Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d.b.a. Verizon Wireless). Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership. Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic–GTE merger on June 16, 2000, creating the largest wireless company in the United States. Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular Wireless acquired AT&amp;T Wireless Services in 2004.

Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006; Ramcell in 2007; Rural Cellular Corporation and SureWest Communications, both in 2008. Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt. The deal was finalized on January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country&#x27;s largest cellphone network. As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&amp;T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. Verizon&#x27;s acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012 and Golden State Cellular&#x27;s operator in 2014.

Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone&#x27;s 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other consideration. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated Verizon Wireless&#x27; valuation at about $290 billion.

In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field (&quot;X-UIDH&quot;) into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as a &quot;supercookie&quot; or &quot;perma-cookie&quot;, although it is technically not a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It cannot be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it cannot be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a &quot;profound violation of trust&quot;, expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users&#x27; outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out. In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and since April 1, 2015, Verizon has allowed customers to opt-out, either online or by calling a special phone number.

In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.

In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon&#x27;s network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.

In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an &quot;unlimited&quot; data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon&#x27;s decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.

In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps. Critics spoke harshly against it.

In May 2018, former Verizon executive Miguel Quiroga launched the pre-paid carrier Visible in Denver Colorado, which Verizon funds and owns.

On June 8, 2018, Verizon announced that Hans Vestberg had been chosen to become CEO on August 1, 2018.

In August 2018, the fire department of Santa Clara County, California, filed evidence in a lawsuit seeking the reinstatement of net neutrality policies, which accused Verizon of throttling an &quot;unlimited&quot; wireless data plan associated with a vehicle that was being used to coordinate responses to the Mendocino Complex Fire. The department reported that a Verizon Wireless customer service representative insisted that they must upgrade to a higher-cost data plan in order to restore their internet speed. In a statement, Verizon acknowledged that they did not properly explain the terms of the contract, and that the representative did not adhere to a company policy of removing these restrictions during emergency situations.

In 2019, Verizon Wireless services were split between two new divisions: Verizon Consumer and Verizon Business. The name &quot;Wireless&quot; was extinguished, rebranding the mobile network as simply Verizon. Verizon still often abbreviates their name to &quot;VZW&quot;, with the W standing for Wireless.

In 2020 Verizon launched a prepaid mobile phone service named Yahoo! Mobile after acquiring a 10% interest in Yahoo!. The service was shut down on August 31, 2021, in favor of Visible.

On November 23, 2021, Verizon purchased TracFone Wireless which was worth an approximately $6.25 billion.

On September 30, 2024, after a massive outage, Verizon confirmed that its cell service was back online.

== Network ==
Verizon Wireless operates 5G and 4G LTE networks. , Verizon claims that 99% of the population of the United States can access their 4G network. However, OpenSignal&#x27;s crowdsourced data showed 4G coverage of 95.9%.

Before Verizon&#x27;s LTE network was launched, the company operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008 in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard. In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets. By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, in 190 markets. , 98% of the U.S. was covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic was on LTE.

In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country&#x27;s biggest cable companies, including Comcast, and Spectrum (Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks at the time) to improve its data network across the U.S. The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.

Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers&#x27; voice calls were still carried over the company&#x27;s CDMA2000 network, which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE); this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher-quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi network. , nearly 4 million of Verizon&#x27;s 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE. In 2019, Verizon announced that they plan to shut down their CDMA2000 network by the end of 2020, making VoLTE the only way to make calls on their network.

In September 2015, Verizon&#x27;s chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with &quot;some level of commercial deployment&quot; by 2017. In late August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.

By the end of 2019, Verizon had launched 5G service in 30 cities across the U.S. Verizon&#x27;s 5G network is deployed on millimeter wave spectrum (mmWave). While fast, the high-band spectrum Verizon uses has limited range and high penetration loss.

In October 2020, during a virtual event unveiling the iPhone 12, Verizon announced that it had begun to widely deploy 5G service on sub-6 GHz spectrum, branded as &quot;Nationwide 5G&quot;. This service has a wider range than its mmWave 5G (henceforth branded by Verizon as &quot;5G Ultra Wideband&quot;) services, and is available to most existing Verizon subscribers with a supported device (unlike mmWave service, which requires one of the service&#x27;s newer unlimited plans), but uses &quot;dynamic spectrum sharing&quot; with LTE service, and does not have the same level of speed as mmWave. As of December 2020, more than 200 million people were able to access Verizon’s 5G network through Verizon’s DSS-enabled service. As of April 2023, Verizon reached 200 million people covered for its Verizon&#x27;s 5G Ultra Wideband.

Verizon intended to retire its 2G and 3G CDMA network in favor of LTE and 5G on January 1, 2021, but made a last-minute decision to &quot;indefinitely&quot; halt the retirement. They later confirmed that the CDMA network will be retired on December 31, 2022. Verizon customers using a CDMA-only device, or an LTE device that does not support Voice over LTE, were required to upgrade to a newer device in order to continue using the network. The shutdown was completed at the end of 2022 as planned.

A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2024 ranked Verizon&#x27;s network as the best in overall national performance, network accessibility, data performance, video performance, and tied for best text performance.

==== Past networks ====
The following chart lists the networks that Verizon previously operated.
== Apps ==
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be &quot;bloatware&quot; that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device&#x27;s operating system.

The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers could stream NFL telecasts to devices with screens or less in size. This contract ended after the 2017 NFL season; Verizon agreed to a new five-year, non-exclusive digital rights agreement, which removes the device class exclusivity, and focuses more upon distributing its streams and other enhanced digital content via its portfolio of internet media brands, rather than being exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers.

As part of a deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon subscribers also have access to exclusive streaming content within the official IndyCar Series app.

The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user&#x27;s service plan and account features. Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones, followed the next month by a launch for iOS. Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternative text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices. VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views. The Verizon Support &amp; Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.

Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices. Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children&#x27;s contacts and lock the devices. Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.

Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel, Visual Voice Mail and Roadside Assistance.

==Products and services==
Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.

===Wireless phone services===
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple&#x27;s iOS and Google&#x27;s Android. Both its basic phones and smartphones use their 4G LTE or 5G network. The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.

===Wireless home phone===
Introduced in February 2015 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon&#x27;s cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.

===Mobile broadband and Wi-Fi===
Verizon Mobile network, branded as Jetpack. The company offered home Internet service through a 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can connect up to 10 devices over Wi-Fi as well as home phone service. This service and device have since been discontinued.

==LTE in Rural America==
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over in 169 rural counties. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company&#x27;s network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks. , all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

<doc id="468634" wikidata="Q181238" url="?curid=468634" title="Africa (Roman province)">
<text>Africa was a Roman province on the northern coast of the continent of Africa. It was established in 146 BC, following the Roman Republic&#x27;s conquest of Carthage in the Third Punic War. It roughly comprised the territory of present-day Tunisia, the northeast of Algeria, and the coast of western Libya along the Gulf of Sidra. The territory was originally and still is inhabited by Berbers, known in Latin as the Numidae and Maurii&quot;,&quot; indigenous to all of North Africa west of Egypt. In the 9th century BC, Rome began encroach on territory in North Africa after the annexation of Carthage and Numidia and settle the Province of Africa with Roman Coloniae.

Africa was one of the wealthiest provinces in the Roman Empire second only to Italy. It was said that Africa fed the Roman populace for eight months of the year, while Egypt provided the remaining four months&#x27; supply. The area east of the Fossa Regia was fully Romanized with one third of the population made of Italian colonists and their descendants, the other two thirds were Romanized Berbers, who were all Christians and nearly all Latin speaking.

== History ==

Rome&#x27;s first province in northern Africa was established by the Roman Republic in 146 BC, following its conquest of Carthage by Scipio Aemilianus in the Third Punic War.

Utica, which had fought on the side of the Romans in the war, was formed as the administrative capital. The remaining territory was left in the domain of the Berber Numidian king Massinissa. At this time, the Roman policy in Africa was simply to prevent another great power from rising on the Northwest Africa.

In 118 BC, the Numidian prince Jugurtha attempted to reunify the smaller kingdoms. However, upon his death, much of Jugurtha&#x27;s territory was placed in the control of the Berber Mauritanian king Bocchus; and, by that time, the romanisation of Africa was firmly rooted.

During Caesar&#x27;s civil war, Caesar created a new African province from territory taken from the Numidians. The original province was called &quot;Africa vetus&quot; with the newer province suffixed &quot;nova&quot;. But during the Second Triumvirate, the two provinces were unified, possibly in 35 BC, in consequence of border conflicts: governors of the province won three triumphs between 34 and 28 BC. Further expansion of the province continued under the emperor Augustus, with conflicts recorded through to AD 6. By 27 BC, Africa was assigned as one of the senatorial provinces in the Augustan settlements and eventually became known as &quot;Africa proconsularis&quot;, as it was ruled by a proconsul rather than a legate of the emperor.

After Diocletian&#x27;s administrative reforms, it was split into &quot;Africa Zeugitana&quot; (which retained the name &quot;Africa Proconsularis&quot;, as it was governed by a proconsul) in the north, &quot;Africa Byzacena&quot; (corresponding to eastern Tunisia) to its south, and &quot;Africa Tripolitania&quot; (corresponding to southern Tunisia and northwest Libya) to the south and southeast of &quot;Africa Byzacena&quot;, all of which were part of the &quot;Dioecesis Africae&quot;. Old Africa (&quot;Africa Vetus&quot;), which generally includes the areas mentioned, was also known by the Romans (Pliny) as &quot;Africa propria&quot;, of which Carthage was the capital.

The region remained a part of the Roman empire until the Germanic migrations of the 5th century. The Vandals crossed into Northwest Africa from Spain in 429 and overran the area by 439 and founded their own kingdom, including Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearics. The Vandals controlled the country as a warrior-elite but faced strong resistance from the native Berbers. The Vandals also persecuted Chalcedonian Roman Africans and Berbers, as the Vandals were adherents of Arianism (the semi-trinitarian doctrines of Arius, a priest of Egypt). Towards the end of the 5th century, the Vandal state fell into decline, abandoning most of the interior territories to the Mauri and other Berber tribes of the region.

In AD 533, Emperor Justinian, using a Vandal dynastic dispute as pretext, sent an army under the general Belisarius to recover Africa. In a short campaign, Belisarius defeated the Vandals, entered Carthage in triumph and re-established Roman rule over the province. The restored Roman administration was successful in fending off the attacks of the Amazigh desert tribes, and by means of an extensive fortification network managed to extend its rule once again to the interior.

The northwest African provinces, together with the Roman possessions in Spain, were grouped into the Praetorian prefecture of Africa, this time separate from Praetorian prefecture of Italy, and transferred to Exarchate of Africa by Emperor Maurice. The Exarchate prospered, and from it resulted the overthrow of the emperor Phocas by Heraclius in 610. Heraclius briefly considered moving the imperial capital from Constantinople to Carthage.

After 640, the exarchate managed to stave off the Muslim Conquest, but in 698, the Muslim Umayyad army from Egypt sacked Carthage and conquered the Exarchate, ending Roman and Christian rule in Northwest Africa.

=== Timetable ===
;Legend

* Mauretania Tingitana belonged to Diocese of Spain under Praetorian prefecture of Gaul, rather than Diocese of Africa under Praetorian prefecture of Italy, from Diocletianic provincial reforms to Vandalic conquest, i.e. during the rule of Western Roman Empire in a broader sense.

== Roman Africans ==

The Roman military presence of Northwest Africa was relatively small, consisting of about 28,000 troops and auxiliaries in Numidia and the two Mauretanian provinces. Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants. A sizable Latin-speaking population developed that was multinational in background, sharing the northwest African region with those speaking Punic and Berber languages. Imperial security forces began to be drawn from the local population, including the Berbers.

Abun-Nasr, in his &quot;A History of the Maghrib&quot;, said that &quot;What made the Berbers accept the Roman way of life all the more readily was that the Romans, though a colonizing people who captured their lands by the might of their arms, did not display any racial exclusiveness and were remarkably tolerant of Berber religious cults, be they indigenous or borrowed from the Carthaginians. However, the Roman territory in Africa was unevenly penetrated by Roman culture. Pockets of non-Romanized Berbers continued to exist throughout the Roman period, even such as in the rural areas of the deeply romanised regions of Tunisia and Numidia.&quot;

By the end of the Western Roman Empire nearly all of the Maghreb was fully romanised, according to Mommsen in his &quot;The Provinces of the Roman Empire&quot;. Roman Africans enjoyed a high level of prosperity. This prosperity (and romanisation) touched partially even the populations living outside the Roman limes (mainly the Garamantes and the Getuli), who were reached with Roman expeditions to Sub-Saharan Africa.

== Economy ==

The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the &quot;granary of the empire&quot;, It was said that Africa fed the Roman populace for eight months of the year, while Egypt provided the remaining four months&#x27; supply. Northwest Africa, according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as African Red Slip, and wool.

The incorporation of colonial cities into the Roman Empire brought an unparalleled degree of urbanization to vast areas of territory, particularly in Northwest Africa. This level of rapid urbanization had a structural impact on the town economy, and artisan production in Roman cities became closely tied to the agrarian spheres of production. As Rome&#x27;s population grew, so did her demand for Northwest African produce. This flourishing trade allowed the Northwest African provinces to increase artisan production in rapidly developing cities, making them highly organized urban centers. Many Roman cities shared both consumer and producer model city aspects, as artisanal activity was directly related to the economic role cities played in long-distance trade networks.

The urban population became increasingly engaged in the craft and service sectors and less in agrarian employment, until a significant portion of the town&#x27;s vitality came from the sale or trade of products through middlemen to markets in areas both rural and abroad. The changes that occurred in the infrastructure for agricultural processing, like olive oil and wine production, as trade continued to develop both cities and commerce directly influenced the volume of artisan production. The scale, quality, and demand for these products reached its acme in Roman Northwest Africa.

===Pottery production===
The Northwest African provinces spanned across regions rich with olive plantations and potters&#x27; clay sources, which led to the early development of fine Ancient Roman pottery, especially African Red Slip &quot;terra sigillata&quot; tableware and clay oil lamp manufacture, as a crucial industry. Lamps provided the most common form of illumination in Rome. They were used for public and private lighting, as votive offerings in temples, lighting at festivals, and as grave goods. As the craft developed and increased in quality and craftsmanship, the Northwest African creations began to rival their Italian and Grecian models and eventually surpassed them in merit and in demand.

The innovative use of molds around the 1st century BC allowed for a much greater variety of shapes and decorative style, and the skill of the lamp maker was demonstrated by the quality of the decoration found typically on the flat top of the lamp, or discus, and the outer rim, or shoulder. The production process took several stages. The decorative motifs were created using small individual molds, and were then added as appliqué to a plain archetype of the lamp. The embellished lamp was then used to make two plaster half molds, one lower half and one upper half mold, and multiple copies were then able to be mass-produced. Decorative motifs ranged according to the lamp&#x27;s function and to popular taste.

Ornate patterning of squares and circles were later added to the shoulder with a stylus, as well as palm trees, small fish, animals, and flower patterns. The discus was reserved for conventional scenes of gods, goddesses, mythological subjects, scenes from daily life, erotic scenes, and natural images. The strongly Christian identity of post-Roman society in Northwest Africa is exemplified in the later instances of Northwest African lamps, on which scenes of Christian images like saints, crosses, and biblical figures became commonly articulated topics. Traditional mythological symbols had enduring popularity as well, which can be traced back to Northwest Africa&#x27;s Punic heritage. Many of the early Northwest African lamps that have been excavated, especially those of high quality, have the name of the manufacturer inscribed on the base, which gives evidence of a highly competitive and thriving local market that developed early and continued to influence and bolster the economy.

==== African Terra Sigillata ====
After a period of artisanal, political, and social decline in the 3rd century AD, lamp-making revived and accelerated. The introduction of fine local red-fired clays in the late 4th century triggered this revival. African Red Slip ware (ARS), or African Terra Sigillata, revolutionized the pottery and lamp-making industry.

ARS ware was produced from the last third of the 1st century AD onwards, and was of major importance in the mid-to-late Roman periods. Famous in antiquity as &quot;fine&quot; or high-quality tableware, it was distributed both regionally and throughout the Mediterranean basin along well-established and heavily trafficked trade routes. Northwest Africa&#x27;s economy flourished as its products were dispersed and demand for its products dramatically increased.

Initially, the ARS lamp designs imitated the simple design of 3rd- to 4th-century coarseware lamps, often with globules on the shoulder or with fluted walls. More ornate designs appeared before the early 5th century as demand spurred on the creative process. The development and widespread distribution of ARS finewares marks the most distinctive phase of Northwest African pottery-making.

These characteristic pottery lamps were produced in large quantities by efficiently organized production centers with large-scale manufacturing abilities. They can be attributed to specific pottery-making centers in northern and central Tunisia by way of chemical analysis, allowing archeologists to trace distribution patterns from their source through the regions and across the Mediterranean. Some major ARS centers in central Tunisia are Sidi Marzouk Tounsi, Henchir el-Guellal (Djilma), and Henchir es-Srira, all of which have ARS lamp artifacts attributed to them by the microscopic chemical makeup of the clay fabric as well as macroscopic style prevalent in that region.

Local pottery markets fueled the economy of not only the towns, but the entire region and supported markets abroad. Certain vessel forms, fabrics, and decorative techniques like rouletting, appliqué, and stamped décor, are specific for a certain region and even for a certain pottery center. If neither form nor decoration of the material is identifiable, it is possible to trace an item using chemical analysis, not just to a certain region but even to its place of production by comparing its makeup to a matrix of important northeastern and central Tunisian potteries.

===Forests, economy, and religion===
Pine forests, with a herb layer of grasses, were widespread and economically significant, especially in the humid zone, the northeast of modern Tunisia (the areas known as the Tell and parts of the Dorsal mountains). Many areas are described as &quot;saltus&quot;, land used for non-agricultural exploitation. Timber, pitch (used to line amphorae and waterproof ships), firewood, pine nuts, and charcoal would all have been produced. Grazing was also practiced on forested land. Olive plantations were also widespread, usually on land previously forested, and the pomace residue after oil extraction was also locally important as fuel. The temple of Mercury Silvius, a god of commerce related to forests, in Dougga, and many lesser monuments elsewhere, are evidence of the importance of forests to local trade.

<text>AT&amp;T Wireless Services, Inc., formerly part of AT&amp;T Corporation, was a wireless telephone carrier founded in 1987 in the United States, based in Redmond, Washington, and later traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol &quot;AWE&quot;, as a separate entity from its former parent.

On October 26, 2004, AT&amp;T Wireless was acquired by Cingular Wireless, a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth, to form the largest wireless carrier in the United States at the time. On November 16, 2004, AT&amp;T Wireless stores were rechristened under the Cingular banner. The legal entity &quot;AT&amp;T Wireless Services, Inc.&quot; was renamed &quot;New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc.&quot;

In late 2005, SBC (the majority partner in Cingular) acquired the original AT&amp;T, and rebranded as &quot;the new AT&amp;T&quot;. Cingular became wholly owned by the new AT&amp;T in December 2006 as a result of the new AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of BellSouth. After the merger, Cingular was renamed AT&amp;T Mobility in late 2006 and remained the largest wireless carrier until 2009 when Verizon Wireless acquired Alltel to become the largest wireless service provider by a number of subscribers.

==History==

===McCaw Cellular===

AT&amp;T Wireless began in 1987 as McCaw Cellular Communications, a cellular telephone pioneer in the United States. Savvy licensing of cellular spectrum in the early 1980s put McCaw Cellular in an extremely strong position, quickly outpacing the growth of the &quot;Baby Bells&quot; in the emerging market. The company purchased MCI Communications&#x27;s mobile businesses in 1986, followed by LIN Broadcasting in 1989, giving them widespread access in all of the major US markets. Partnering with AT&amp;T as a technology provider, McCaw introduced their &quot;Cellular One&quot; service in 1990, the first truly national cellular system. AT&amp;T purchased 33% of the company in 1992 and arranged a merger in 1994 that made Craig McCaw one of AT&amp;T&#x27;s largest shareholders. In 2002, the company was spun off from AT&amp;T to become AT&amp;T Wireless Services.

In 1966, J. Elroy McCaw sold one of his cable television holdings in Centralia, Washington to his three sons, including Craig, who was 16 years old at the time. Craig took an increasingly central role in the development of McCaw Communications, and by the early 1980s had grown the company from 2,000 subscribers to about $5 million in annual revenue.

In 1981 McCaw came across an AT&amp;T document about the future of cellular telephony, which predicted that by the start of the 21st century there would be 900,000 cellular subscribers in the United States. Intrigued, McCaw found that the licenses for cellular spectrum were being sold at $4.50 per &quot;pop&quot;, meaning he could build a base for future subscribers for very low cost. By 1983, McCaw Communications had purchased licenses in six of the 30 largest US markets. McCaw then succeeded in using the licenses and collateral, based on the AT&amp;T projections, using that collateral to take out loans and buy more licenses, and eventually buying billions of dollars of spectrum. In 1987 he sold the cable business for $755 million and used this new capital to buy even more cellular licenses.

It was around this time that the first wave of analog cellular telephones were starting to enter the consumer consciousness. The Baby Bells started the process of buying their own licenses, only to find that McCaw owned enough of most of the major markets to lock them out unless they purchased spare licenses from him, at a huge profit. His network of licenses in the major markets was used as a lever to buy, sell or trade licenses in other markets that were not considered profitable, at a considerable discount. In 1986 the company purchased MCI&#x27;s wireless operations, cellular and paging, for $122 million, and changed their name to &quot;McCaw Cellular Communications&quot;. In 1989 the company outbid BellSouth for control of LIN Broadcasting, which owned licenses in Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, paying $3.5 billion, a price that represented $350 per license.

===Cellular One===

At this point McCaw&#x27;s focus turned from dealing licenses to servicing the network, signing up customers in what was now a maturing technology on the cusp of explosive growth. In order to handle the customer side of the business, McCaw turned to AT&amp;T for technology.

In 1990, McCaw Cellular introduced SS7 signaling across their network. Prior to this, each cell tower in the network connected to local signaling, billing, and sets of land-lines. Since only the towers in the area local to the customer&#x27;s home had access to dialing and routing information, when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them. With the introduction of SS7 signaling, the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network (known technically as Non-Facility Associated Signalling), tying it together into a single national network. They called the new system &quot;Cellular One&quot;, and introduced the concept of roaming charges. That year, McCaw earned $54 million, making him America&#x27;s highest-paid chief executive.

The partnership grew in November 1992, when AT&amp;T purchased 1/3 of the company for $3.8 billion. At the time, the company was generating $1.75 billion in annual revenue, and had two million Cellular One subscribers - far more customers than AT&amp;T&#x27;s earlier projections for all cellular use in the US, at a point almost ten years earlier.

===Purchase by AT&amp;T Corporation===
In 1994 the merger of the two companies was completed when AT&amp;T purchased the rest of McCaw Cellular for $11.5 billion, at that time the second largest merger in US history, second only to the RJR Nabisco takeover documented in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;. The merger was completed in late 1994, creating AT&amp;T Wireless Group, which was at that time the largest cellular carrier in the US. AT&amp;T kick-started their cellular division with 2 million subscribers. As a result of the merger, Craig McCaw became one of AT&amp;T&#x27;s largest shareholders, but he refused to sit on the Board of Directors because he couldn&#x27;t stand long meetings. McCaw left daily operations to focus on Teledesic, passing control of AT&amp;T Wireless to James Barksdale, and then Steve Hooper when Barksdale left for Netscape.

Hooper, a long time McCaw Cellular executive, was tapped by AT&amp;T to be the CEO of the newly acquired division. Under his direction, AT&amp;T Wireless grew to be the nation&#x27;s largest cellular provider by the end of 1997, at which point Hooper and many of the remaining McCaw era executives departed. By 1999 and 2000 the cellular industry began to consolidate and Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless became the first and second-largest national carriers.

The year 1999 also brought John D. Zeglis as chief executive in October, followed a few months later by Dan Hesse&#x27;s departure, who had been head of the division since 1997. Over the next year and a half, all six McCaw regional presidents left the declining company.

===Spinoff===
In April 2000, AT&amp;T Wireless became a separately traded entity with the world&#x27;s largest initial public offering at that time. Just over a year later in July 2001, AT&amp;T Wireless became a separate company rather than a division of AT&amp;T Corporation

In 2003, AT&amp;T Wireless was granted several mobile licenses for Caribbean countries including Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. AT&amp;T Wireless&#x27;s decline climaxed in 2003 with the FCC mandating the allowance of porting numbers to other carriers. AT&amp;T Wireless experienced a mass exodus of many customers who were fed up with years of degrading service and poor coverage. By the end of 2003, AT&amp;T Wireless faced a public relations nightmare when a new system for adding subscribers and porting numbers in/out was implemented and botched. Realizing that it faced an impossible situation, AT&amp;T Wireless Services, Inc began accepting bids in early 2004 to be acquired.

As of January 1, 2004, the largest single shareholder of AT&amp;T Wireless was Japan&#x27;s NTT DoCoMo, which was one of the first to place a bid to buy the company.

In the middle of 2004 much of the Caribbean operations and Bermuda were agreed to be sold to Digicel Group.

===Acquisition by Cingular===

On February 13, 2004, AT&amp;T Wireless accepted bids for the acquisition of the wireless company. The two top bidders were British carrier Vodafone and American competitor Cingular. Cingular was owned by two Baby Bells; 40% by BellSouth and 60% by SBC Communications. Vodafone owned 45% of Verizon Wireless and had it succeeded in the bid, their share of Verizon Wireless would then have been sold to parent company Verizon Communications. Cingular emerged victorious February 17 by agreeing to pay more than $41 billion, more than twice the company&#x27;s recent trading value, to acquire AT&amp;T Wireless. Some analysts have said that although Vodafone, the world&#x27;s largest mobile operator, was unsuccessful in acquiring the company, it was nonetheless successful in forcing a competitor to overpay for the acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless.

The sale received US government approval and closed on October 26. Companies that originally comprised Cingular from its inception, such as BellSouth Mobility, were absorbed into the AT&amp;T Wireless Services corporate structure. The AT&amp;T Wireless brand was retired by Cingular on April 26, 2005, six months after the close of the merger. This was per a pre-spinoff agreement with AT&amp;T Corp. that stated that if AT&amp;T Wireless was to be bought by a competitor, the rights to the name AT&amp;T Wireless and the use of the AT&amp;T name in wireless phone service would revert to AT&amp;T Corp.

AT&amp;T Wireless&#x27;s prepaid services, Go Phone, was adopted by Cingular Wireless after the merger closed, and was used by the current AT&amp;T Mobility until it was rebranded as AT&amp;T PREPAID in 2017.

==Partnerships==
Rogers AT&amp;T Wireless was a publicly traded partnership between Rogers and AT&amp;T. It operated a mobile network in Canada until Rogers bought out AT&amp;T&#x27;s stake in 2004 and took the company private. &quot;See Rogers Wireless.&quot;

SunCom Wireless was a brand name used by three separate companies: Telecorp PCS, Tritel PCS, and Triton PCS (based in Arlington, VA, Jackson, MS, and Berwyn, PA, respectively). All three used the same SunCom logo, but operated as completely independent companies, though all were affiliates of AT&amp;T Wireless, which owned 23% of each company. Telecorp operated primarily in Wisconsin, Iowa, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Puerto Rico. Tritel operated primarily in Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee. Triton operated primarily in North and South Carolina and Virginia. In 2002, Telecorp and Tritel completed a merger, while Triton remained independent. In 2003, AT&amp;T Wireless acquired Telecorp/Tritel and in 2004, closed the Telecorp headquarters in Arlington, VA.

Cincinnati Bell Wireless started as a joint venture between Cincinnati Bell and AT&amp;T Wireless, in which AT&amp;T Wireless owned 20%. When AT&amp;T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, control of the 20% passed to Cingular as well. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of Cincinnati Bell Wireless by purchasing Cingular&#x27;s 20% ownership for $80 million.

==AT&amp;T brand returns to wireless==
The AT&amp;T brand in wireless ended in 2004, but it would be brought back a few years later. On November 18, 2005, SBC Communications completed a merger with AT&amp;T Corp., and took on the name AT&amp;T and created a new modern globe logo. After the merger, rumors surfaced of a revival of AT&amp;T&#x27;s brand in wireless via a rebranding of Cingular; however, Cingular, Bellsouth, and the new AT&amp;T maintained that the Cingular brand would remain for the time being.

Then, the new AT&amp;T announced on March 5, 2006, that it would be acquiring BellSouth&#x27;s telephone operations and its stake in Cingular Wireless. On December 29, 2006, the FCC gave its final approval to the AT&amp;T and BellSouth merger. With both parent companies merged into one, Cingular Wireless officially became AT&amp;T Mobility in 2007. The rebranding phase was a gradual process but by mid-2007, the Cingular Wireless brand (not the company) was officially discontinued for the AT&amp;T name.

Thus, AT&amp;T as a wireless brand is alive and well; however, the old AT&amp;T Wireless Services company remains defunct. Today, AT&amp;T stores sell all AT&amp;T products and services: Wireless, Landline, Internet, U-Verse, DIRECTV, and more. AT&amp;T currently markets all services under one brand, even though the wireless division is commonly referred to as &quot;AT&amp;T Mobility&quot; both internally and externally.

<doc id="468641" wikidata="Q16252268" url="?curid=468641" title="History of perpetual motion machines">
<text>The history of perpetual motion machines dates at least back to the Middle Ages. For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of thermodynamics have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as &quot;overunity&quot;, to describe their inventions. 

== History ==
=== Pre-19th century ===
There are some unsourced claims that a perpetual motion machine called the &quot;magic wheel&quot; (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century Bavaria. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.

Early designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian mathematician–astronomer Bhaskara II, who described a wheel (Bhāskara&#x27;s wheel) that he claimed would run forever.

A drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, a 13th-century French master mason and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with mechanics and architecture. Following the example of Villard, Peter of Maricourt designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic armillary sphere.

Leonardo da Vinci made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free energy. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.

Mark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.

Various scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 Cornelius Drebbel in &quot;Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh&quot; dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to James I of England. It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621. Robert Boyle devised the &quot;perpetual vase&quot; (&quot;perpetual goblet&quot; or &quot;hydrostatic paradox&quot;) which was discussed by Denis Papin in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1685. Johann Bernoulli proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, Georg Andreas Böckler, designed a &quot;self operating&quot; self-powered water mill and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of Archimedes&#x27; screws. In 1712, Johann Bessler (Orffyreus), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.

In the 1760s, James Cox and John Joseph Merlin developed Cox&#x27;s timepiece. Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in atmospheric pressure via a mercury barometer, this is not the case.

In 1775, the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris made the statement that the Academy &quot;will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion.&quot;

=== Industrial Revolution ===

==== 19th century ====
In 1812, Charles Redheffer, in Philadelphia, claimed to have developed a &quot;generator&quot; that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee. Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding. It was there that Robert Fulton exposed Redheffer&#x27;s schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a catgut belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.

In 1827, Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet devised a machine running on capillary action that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.

In 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a &quot;thrust key-type gearing&quot; of a rotary engine. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device&#x27;s levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.

In 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a &quot;proprietary&quot; perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; article &quot;The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made&quot;. Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.

John Ernst Worrell Keely claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used &quot;etheric technology&quot;. In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of tuning forks. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, venture capitalists accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely&#x27;s machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.

==== 1900 to 1950 ====
In 1900, Nikola Tesla claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the second kind. No prototype was produced. He wrote:

David Unaipon, Australian inventor, had a lifelong fascination with perpetual motion. One of his studies on Newtonian mechanics led him to create a shearing machine in 1910 that converted curvilineal motion into straight line movement. The device is the basis of modern mechanical shears.

In the 1910s and 1920s, Harry Perrigo of Kansas City, Missouri, a graduate of MIT, claimed development of a free energy device. Perrigo claimed the energy source was &quot;from thin air&quot; or from aether waves. He demonstrated the device before the Congress of the United States on December 15, 1917. Perrigo had a pending application for the &quot;Improvement in Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and Transforming Ether Electric Energy&quot;. Investigators report that his device contained a hidden motor battery.
&quot;Popular Science&quot;, in the October 1920 issue, published an article on the lure of perpetual motion.

=== Modern era ===

==== 1951 to 1980 ====
In 1966, Josef Papp (sometimes referred to as Joseph Papp or Joseph Papf) supposedly developed an alternative car engine that used inert gases. He gained a few investors but when the engine was publicly demonstrated, an explosion killed one of the observers and injured two others. Papp blamed the accident on interference by physicist Richard Feynman, who later shared his observations in an article in &quot;Laser&quot;, the journal of the Southern Californian Skeptics. Papp continued to accept money but never demonstrated another engine.

On December 20 of 1977, Emil T. Hartman received titled &quot;Permanent magnet propulsion system&quot;. This device is related to the Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy (SMOT).
Paul Baumann, a German engineer, developed a machine referred to as the &quot;Testatika&quot; and known as the &quot;Swiss M-L converter&quot; or &quot;Thesta-Distatica&quot;.

Guido Franch reportedly had a process of transmuting water molecules into high-octane gasoline compounds (named Mota fuel) that would reduce the price of gasoline to 8 cents per gallon. This process involved a green powder (this claim may be related to the similar ones of John Andrews (1917)). He was brought to court for fraud in 1954 and acquitted, but in 1973 was convicted. Justice William Bauer and Justice Philip Romiti both observed a demonstration in the 1954 case.

In 1958, Otis T. Carr from Oklahoma formed a company to manufacture UFO-styled spaceships and hovercraft. Carr sold stock for this commercial endeavour. He also promoted free energy machines. He claimed inspiration from Nikola Tesla, among others.

In 1962, physicist Richard Feynman discussed a Brownian ratchet that would supposedly extract meaningful work from Brownian motion, although he went on to demonstrate how such a device would fail to work in practice.

In the 1970s, David Hamel produced the Hamel generator, an &quot;antigravity&quot; device, supposedly after an alien abduction. The device was tested on &quot;MythBusters&quot; where it failed to demonstrate any lift-generating capability.
Howard Robert Johnson developed a permanent magnet motor and, on April 24, 1979, received .[The United States Patent office main classification of his 4151431 patent is as an &quot;electrical generator or motor structure, dynamoelectric, linear&quot; (310/12).] Johnson claimed that his device generates motion, either rotary or linear, from nothing but permanent magnets in rotor as well as stator, acting against each other. He estimated that permanent magnets made of proper hard materials should lose less than two percent of their magnetization in powering a device for 18 years.

In 1979, Joseph Westley Newman applied for a patent on a direct current electrical motor which, according to his book &quot;The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman&quot; did more mechanical work than could be accounted for by the electrical power supplied to it. Newman&#x27;s patent application was rejected in 1983.
Newman sued the US Patent and Trademark Office in US District Court, which ordered the National Bureau of Standards to test his machine; they informed the Court that Newman&#x27;s device did not produce more power than supplied by the batteries it was connected to, and the Court found against Newman.

==== 1981 to 1999 ====
Dr. Yuri S. Potapov of Moldova claimed development of an over-unity electrothermal water-based generator (referred to as &quot;Yusmar 1&quot;). He founded the YUSMAR company to promote his device. The device has failed to produce over unity under tests.

Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (CETI) claimed development of a device called the Patterson power cell that outputs small yet anomalous amounts of heat, perhaps due to cold fusion. Skeptics state that inaccurate measurements of friction effects from the cooling flow through the pellets may be responsible for the results.

Dave Jones created a device in 1981 using a seemingly constantly rotating bicycle wheel sealed in a plexiglass container. He created it as a scientific joke, always stating that it was a fake and not a true perpetual motion machine, but to date no one has yet discovered how the device works. Before he died of cancer in 2017, his brother Peter persuaded him to write down the secret behind the wheel, which he sent in a letter to Martyn Poliakoff, a chemist at the University of Nottingham. Adam Savage examined the wheel in 2023, which was housed at the Royal Society, producing a video of the event, in which he suspected that an electrical mechanism of some kind drove the device.

==== 2000s ====
The motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) was built by Tom Bearden. Allegedly, the device can eventually sustain its operation in addition to powering a load without application of external electrical power. Bearden claimed that it didn&#x27;t violate the first law of thermodynamics because it extracted vacuum energy from the immediate environment. Critics dismiss this theory and instead identify it as a perpetual motion machine with an unscientific rationalization. Science writer Martin Gardner said that Bearden&#x27;s physics theories, compiled in the self-published book &quot;Energy from the Vacuum&quot;, are considered &quot;howlers&quot; by physicists, and that his doctorate title was obtained from a diploma mill. Bearden then founded and directed the Alpha Foundation&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study (AIAS) to further propagate his theories. This group has published papers in established physics journals and in books published by leading publishing houses, but one analysis lamented these publications because the texts were &quot;full of misconceptions and misunderstandings concerning the theory of the electromagnetic field.&quot; When Bearden was awarded in 2002, the American Physical Society issued a statement against the granting. The United States Patent and Trademark Office said that it would reexamine the patent and change the way it recruits examiners, and re-certify examiners on a regular basis, to prevent similar patents from being granted again.

In 2002, the GWE (Genesis World Energy) group claimed to have 400 people developing a device that supposedly separated water into H2 and O2 using less energy than conventionally thought possible. No independent confirmation was ever made of their claims, and in 2006, company founder Patrick Kelly was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing funds from investors.

In 2006, Steorn Ltd. claimed to have built an over-unity device based on rotating magnets, and took out an advertisement soliciting scientists to test their claims. The selection process for twelve began in September 2006 and concluded in December 2006. The selected jury started investigating Steorn&#x27;s claims. A public demonstration scheduled for July 4, 2007 was canceled due to &quot;technical difficulties&quot;. In June 2009, the selected jury said the technology does not work.

<doc id="468642" wikidata="Q318358" url="?curid=468642" title="Alexander Kielland">
<text>Alexander Lange Kielland (; 18 February 1849 – 6 April 1906) was a Norwegian realistic writer of the 19th century. He is one of the so-called &quot;The Four Greats&quot; of Norwegian literature, along with Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Jonas Lie.

==Background==
Born in Stavanger, Norway, he grew up in a rich merchant family. He was the son of consul Jens Zetlitz Kielland and great-grandson of Gabriel Schanche Kielland (1760–1821). Kielland was the younger brother of Norwegian landscape painter Kitty Lange Kielland.

His family also included his son, Jens Zetlitz Kielland, (1873–1926); uncle Jacob Otto Lange (1833–1902), cousin Axel Christian Zetlitz Kielland (1853–1924), nephew Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland (1866–1926), cousin Anders Lange (1904–1974) and great nephew Jacob Christie Kielland (1897–1972). His great niece Axeliane Christiane Zetlitz Kielland (1916–1995) married Agnar Mykle (1915–1994).

==Career==
Despite being born wealthy, he had a sincere affection for the less fortunate, treating his workers well when he was a factory owner. He remained a spokesman for the weak and a critic of society throughout his time as a writer. His best known plays were the satirical comedies &quot;Tre Par&quot; (1886) and &quot;Professoren&quot; (1888). He was also well known for his short stories.

Among his most famous works are the novels &quot;Gift&quot; (1883), &quot;Skipper Worse&quot; (1882) and &quot;Garman &amp; Worse&quot; (1880). &quot;Gift&quot; (published in English as &quot;Poison &quot;) is the first of a trilogy including &quot;Fortuna&quot; (1884) and &quot;St. Hans Fest&quot; (1887). In this trilogy, Kielland satirizes the hypocrisy of Norway&#x27;s clergy. In &quot;Gift&quot;, Kielland debates the preference for Latin that Norwegian teachers had during his time. The story features a young boy called Marius, lying on his deathbed while repeating Latin grammar.

From 1889 to 1890, Kielland worked as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;Stavanger Avis&quot;. Kielland virtually stopped writing fiction in 1891 and published only stories which had been published earlier. In 1891 he was designated the mayor of his hometown, Stavanger, until 1902 when he relocated to Molde as county governor of the land Møre og Romsdal.

It has been debated why Kielland ended his career as a writer so early. Some believe that he was so much of a realist that he could not deal with the neo-romantic tendencies of Norwegian literature at the end of the 19th century. A more probable reason is that he chose to focus on his political career.

The biography of Alexander L. Kielland by Tor Obrestad includes thoughts about Kielland dying from obesity. Already from the mid-1880s, Kielland had suffered from shortness of breath. He had several heart attacks, constantly gained weight, and couldn&#x27;t control his great passion for food.

<text>KC Boutiette (born April 11, 1970) is an American speed skater from Tacoma, Washington, and a four-time Olympian. He was first of the wave of inline speed skaters, and made the transition from inline to ice, in order to have a shot at going to the Olympics.

==Biography==
In 1993, he showed up at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, looking to improve his technique on inline skates. However, he ended up earning a spot on the team that would be sent to the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Although he had been a champion inline speed skater for years, Boutiette at that time had no ice speed skating experience at all. Nevertheless, within a few months he made the team.

Although Boutiette has never won an Olympic medal, he demonstrated to other American inline speed skaters that the opportunity was there if they would give it a shot. Following in his footsteps were Apolo Ohno, Derek Parra, Jennifer Rodriguez (Boutiette&#x27;s ex-wife), and Joey Cheek, who won seven medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. After 2002 he went out and hand-picked another former inline skater, Chad Hedrick, who went on to win three medals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, after switching to ice skating in 2003. Now almost half of the Olympic team were inline skaters for whom he paved the way. Boutiette skated in the team pursuit in the 2006 Olympics.

In the Netherlands, Boutiette participated as a marathon speed skater for several years and in this period he won the Six Days of the Greenery twice in 2003 and 2004. He wore the Brussels sprout suit for ten days in between 2003 and 2005, the second in ranking after Cédric Michaud. In total he won 23 speed skating marathons on artificial tracks. He also was the leader in the Essent Cup for two days, wearing the orange suit.
