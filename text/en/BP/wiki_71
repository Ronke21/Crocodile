<text>The Protestant Protective Association was an anti-Catholic group in the 1890s based in Ontario, Canada, associated with the Orange Order. Originally a spinoff of the American group the American Protective Association, it became independent in 1892. The PPA denounced the role of Catholics and French-Canadians in politics, and warned Protestants that Catholics were attempting to take over Ontario. It aimed to eliminate French language education in schools in Ontario and western Canada (particularly Manitoba), and to roll back or block Catholic school systems in those provinces.

== Ontario ==
The party began to achieve success following the surprise victory of Peter Duncan McCallum in the 1893 provincial by-election in Lambton East. By 1894, the mayors of Brantford, London, Hamilton, Chatham, Kincardine, and Petrolia, Ontario were all elected as members of the PPA. 

In the 1894 provincial election, the party succeeded in winning nine seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. These members worked closely with the opposition Ontario Conservative Party. 

No PPA candidates ran in the 1898 Ontario election, or in any subsequent Ontario election. William Henry Reid of the Durham West riding was the only PPA MPP to return to the 1898 provincial legislature,; however, in 1898, he ran and was elected as a member of the Conservative Party.

== Federal ==
The PPA ran several candidates in Ontario for the 1896 federal election as a protest against the Conservative Party&#x27;s conflicted position on the Manitoba Schools Question. The PPA failed to win any seats in the House of Commons of Canada, but was instrumental in defeating Conservative candidates in four of the five ridings in which it nominated candidates.

<text>George Mathew Fernandes (3 June 1930 – 29 January 2019) was an Indian trade unionist, statesman, and journalist, who served as the Defence Minister of India from 1998 until 2004. A veteran socialist, he was a member of the Lok Sabha for over 30 years, starting from Bombay (present-day Mumbai) in 1967 till 2009 mostly representing constituencies from Bihar. He was the leader of the Samyukta Socialist Party and the Socialist Party, a key member of the Janata Party, the Janata Party (Secular) and the Janata Dal, and, finally, the founder of the Samata Party. Holding several prominent ministerial portfolios during his career, including communication, industry, railways, and defence, he was posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, in 2020.

A native of Mangalore, Fernandes was sent to Bangalore in 1946 to be trained as a priest. In 1949, he moved to Bombay, where he joined the socialist trade union movement. Becoming a trade union leader, Fernandes organised many strikes and &quot;bandhs&quot; in Bombay in the 1950s and 1960s while working with the Indian Railways. He defeated S K Patil of the Indian National Congress in the 1967 parliamentary elections from the Bombay South constituency. As president of the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation, he led the 1974 railways strike. Fernandes went underground during the Emergency era of 1975, while challenging Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for imposing a state of emergency, but in 1976 he was arrested and tried in the infamous Baroda dynamite case.

In 1977, after the Emergency had been lifted, Fernandes won the Muzaffarpur seat in Bihar in absentia. As industries minister, he revoked the licences for multinationals IBM and Coca-Cola to operate in India, due to investment violations. As railways minister from 1989 to 1990 he was the driving force behind the Konkan Railway project. As defence minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led second and third Atal Bihari Vajpayee ministries (1998–2004), he oversaw the outbreak of the Kargil War and the implementation of nuclear tests at Pokhran. Fernandes has been dogged by various controversies, including the Barak Missile scandal and the Tehelka affair. George Fernandes won nine Lok Sabha elections from 1967 to 2004. He died on 29 January 2019 at the age of 88.

==Early life==
George Fernandes was born on 3 June 1930 to John Joseph Fernandes and Alice Martha Fernandes (&quot;née&quot; Pinto), in Mangalore to a Mangalorean Catholic family. The eldest of six children, all sons, his siblings are Lawrence, Michael, Paul, Aloysius, and Richard. His mother was a great admirer of King George V (who was also born on 3 June), hence she named her first son George. His father was employed by the Peerless Finance group as an insurance executive, and headed their office of South India for several years. George was fondly called &quot;Gerry&quot; in close family circles. He attended his first few years of schooling at a government school near his house called &quot;Board school&quot;, a municipal school and a church school.

He studied from fifth grade at the school attached to St. Aloysius College, Mangalore, where he completed his Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC).

In an interview with &quot;ETV&quot;, Fernandes described his decision to stop studies after matriculation despite his father wishing him to study and become a lawyer. His premise was that he did not want to become a lawyer and fight cases for his father who often evicted tenants from a patch of land that they owned on the outskirts of Mangalore. He was instead enrolled in a seminary for studies to become a priest. He went to St Peter&#x27;s Seminary in Bangalore at the age of 16, to be trained as a Roman Catholic priest, studying philosophy for two and a half years from 1946 to 1948. At the age of 19, he left the seminary due to sheer frustration because he was appalled that the rectors ate better food and sat at higher tables than the seminarians. He later confessed that, &quot;I was disillusioned, because there was a lot of difference between precept and practice where the Church was concerned.&quot;

Fernandes began work at the age of 19, organising exploited workers in the road transport industry and in the hotels and restaurants in Mangalore. For some time, he worked as an insurance agent and also tried wholesale businesses of shaving blades. His first guru was a Mangalorean activist and a freedom fighter Ammembala Balappa (1922–2014). Balappa identified and groomed a young Fernandes, who had taken refuge at places surrounding Nehru Maidan in Mangalore city, after being thrown out of the house. Initially, with Balappa&#x27;s mentorship Fernandes gathered hotel workers and other menial labourers in the city. He was associated with Ram Manohar Lohia-led Praja Socialist Party (PSP) in its Mangalore division. Fernandes and few other union workers led Mangalore&#x27;s earliest labour strikes on behalf of the workers of Canara Public Conveyance (CPC)in 1949. The strike was cracked down as the police resorted to lathi charge. After the strike, Fernandes came in contact with renowned Bombay-based Trade Union leader Placid D’Mello (1919–1958). Fernandes later left to Bombay in 1950 and faced tremendous hardships. Here again, he became a prodigy of D&#x27;Mello, who was handling the arduous Dock unions. After D&#x27;Mello&#x27;s death in 1958, Fernandes succeeded in managing dock Unions and other major labour force unions in the city that included Taximen unions, textile mills and Mazdoor Unions.

==Career==
===Brief history of participating in elections===
He first contested Lok Sabha election in 1967 as a socialist, and defeated the Congress stalwart Sa Kaa Patil in Bombay in a famous upset, earning the sobriquet &#x27;George the Giant-killer&#x27;. He contested from Muzaffarpur, Bihar in 1977 while still in jail as a Janata Party candidate, and won. He was made minister in the first non-Congress govt in India. In 1979, he resigned from : Janata Party, joined Charan Singh&#x27;s breakaway Janata Party (S), and won again from Muzaffarpur in 1980. In 1984 he fought from Bangalore on Janata Party&#x27;s ticket but lost to Jaffar Sharif of Congress. He lost a bye-poll from Banka in 1985 and again in 1986. In 1989 and 1991, he shifted back to Bihar and won both times from Muzaffarpur as Janata Dal candidate. In 1994, he left Janata Dal after differences with Lalu Yadav and formed Samata Party which allied with BJP. 
In 1996 and 1998 elections, he won from Nalanda as Samata Party candidate. Samata Party merged with Janata Dal (United) and he won again from Nalanda in 1999. In 2004 he won from Muzaffarpur. In 2009 he was denied ticket by his party, contested from Muzaffarpur as an independent and lost. Later he was elected to Rajya Sabha in 2009. In the 2010s he was afflicted for many years with Alzheimer&#x27;s and died in January 2019.

===Life in Mumbai===
After leaving the seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 in search of a job. He went to the office of Socialist Party in Bombay and met Madhu Dandavate to ask him for staying there for some time but was not welcomed. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a proofreader for The Times of India newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, &quot;When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In the middle of the night policemen used to come and wake me up and ask me to move on.&quot; He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D’Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s.

In 1951, Fernandes joined Bombay Dock Worker&#x27;s Union and worked to revive the publication of a newsletter &quot;The Dockman.&quot; When in August 1951, Placid D’Mello was arrested, he organised foot march of around two-hundred dock workers from Bombay to Poona to meet Chief Minister Morarji Desai for the release of D’Mello. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.

On his first day at Bombay Municipal Corporation, 10 April 1961, he requested that the proceedings to be conducted in Marathi instead of English language. On 4 April 1963, George was arrested along with Sardar Parsbag Singh and Janardhan Upadhyay under Defence of India act because of their demand to change the taxi fair structure. He was jailed at Nasik Central Jail. On 9 August 1963, Madhu Limaye along with other trade union leaders organised a big rally in Bombay for his release. On 13 December 1963, he was released from Nagpur Central Jail.

The moment that thrust Fernandes into the limelight was his decision to contest the 1967 general election. He was offered a party ticket for the Bombay South constituency by the Samyukta Socialist Party against the more wellknown S. K. Patil of the Indian National Congress in Bombay. Patil was a seasoned politician, with two decades of experience. Nevertheless, Fernandes won by garnering 48.5 per cent of the votes, thus earning his nickname, &quot;George the Giantkiller&quot;. The shocking defeat ended Patil&#x27;s political career.

Fernandes emerged as a key leader in the upsurge of strike actions in Bombay during the second half of the 1960s but, by the beginnings of the 1970s, the impetus of his leadership had largely disappeared. In 1969, he was chosen General Secretary of the Samyukta Socialist Party, and in 1973 became the chairman of the Socialist Party. After the 1970s, Fernandes failed to make major inroads in Bombay&#x27;s growing private-sector industries.

===1974 railway strike===
The most notable strike organised by Fernandes, when he was President of the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation, was the All India Railway strike of 1974, where the entire nation was brought to a halt. The strike was the result of grievances by railway workers that had been built up over two decades before the strike. Though there were three Pay commissions between 1947 and 1974, none of them increased the standard of living of the workers. In February 1974, the National Coordinating Committee for Railwaymen&#x27;s Struggle (NCCRS) was formed to bring all the railway unions, the central trade unions and political parties in the Opposition together to prepare for the strike to start on 8 May 1974. In Bombay, electricity and transport workers, as well as taxi drivers joined the protests. In Gaya, Bihar, striking workers and their families squatted on the tracks. More than 10,000 workers of the Integral Coach Factory in Madras marched to the Southern Railway headquarters to express their solidarity with the striking workers. Similar protests erupted across the country.

The strike, which started on 8 May 1974, at the time of economic crisis, provoked strong government reactions and massive arrests. According to Amnesty International, 30,000 trade unionists were detained, most held under preventive detention laws. Those arrested included not only members of the strike action committee and trade unionists, but also railwaymen who participated in the strike. The strike was called off unilaterally on 27 May 1974 by the Action Committee. As explained later by Fernandes, &quot;the strike was called off because those conducting the strike had started speaking in different voices.&quot; Although large number of prisoners were released, among them Fernandes, thousands remained in detention, charged with specific offences. The strike led to a sense of insecurity and threat that led to Indira Gandhi&#x27;s imposition of the Emergency era in 1975. Previous strikes were aimed at companies or industries, but this strike was aimed at the government and from its ramifications proved to be the most successful of disastrous industrial actions in Indian history.

===Emergency era and union ministry===
The reigning Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declared a state of emergency on 25 June 1975 due to internal political disturbances. Accordingly, all fundamental rights enjoyed in the Indian Constitution were suspended. Political dissidents, newspaper reporters, opposition leaders who opposed the emergency were jailed. George Fernandes, along with like-minded leaders, opposed what he saw as a blatant misuse of power. 
A day before the emergency George Fernandes had arrived in Berhampur City in Odisha (on 24 June 1975) and was staying at his father-in-law Humayun Kabir&#x27;s house on Gopalpur-On-Sea beach near Berhampur City, Odisha. Humayun Kabir was the education minister in former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s cabinet.

George Fernandes&#x27; 25 June schedule in Berhampur city was packed. He attended a meeting of the Berhampur University Employees Association, a meeting with socialist leaders and workers and a gathering of intellectuals in the evening. He was scheduled to attend a meeting of the Railways Workers Association of Odisha on 26 June in Berhampur City but before that he hid himself there secretly.
A warrant was issued in Fernandes&#x27; name and subsequently he went underground to escape arrest and prosecution. When the police failed to capture him, they arrested and tortured his brother, Lawrence Fernandes, to reveal his brother&#x27;s whereabouts. Snehalata Reddy, a chronic asthmatic was arrested for being in touch with George Fernandes and, as she was not given adequate care in the prison, died soon after her release.

In July 1975, Fernandes arrived in Baroda. There, he met Kirit Bhatt, who was president of Baroda Union of Journalists, and Vikram Rao, a staff correspondent of &quot;The Times of India&quot; at Baroda, both who opposed the Emergency. They used to meet and discuss on what could be done to topple the autocratic Indira Gandhi Government. An industrialist friend, Viren J. Shah, managing director of Mukand Ltd., helped them find contacts for procuring dynamite, used extensively in quarries around Halol (near Baroda). They aimed at blowing up toilets in government offices and cause explosions near the venue of public meetings to be addressed by Indira Gandhi. The idea was not to injure anybody, but only create a scare. The explosions were to be carried out either late in the night or hours before the public meeting was to begin to avoid injury. A plan was hatched to blow up a dais four hours before Indira Gandhi was to address a meeting in Varanasi. The conspiracy later came to be known as the infamous Baroda dynamite case.

According to Bhatt, there were two more plans that never worked out. Fernandes also wanted to rob a train used to carry weapons from Pimpri (near Poona) to Bombay. The weapons were to be used to blast government offices. Yet another plan was to take the help of other countries by using ham radio.

On 10 June 1976, he was finally arrested in Calcutta on charges of smuggling dynamite to blow up government establishments in protest against the imposition of emergency, in what came to be known as the Baroda dynamite case. After his arrest, Amnesty International members cabled the Government requesting that he be given immediate access to a lawyer and that his physical protection be guaranteed. Three world leaders from Germany, Norway and Austria were believed to have cabled Indira Gandhi and cautioned her against harming Fernandes. From Baroda, the accused were shifted to Tihar Jail. The accused were never chargesheeted.

====Union Minister and Muzaffarpur MP post-1977====
After the emergency was lifted, elections were held in India from 16 to 20 March 1977. The Congress Party, led by Indira Gandhi, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Janata Party, a coalition created in 1977 out of several small parties that opposed Gandhi&#x27;s Emergency era. The Janata Party and its allies came to power, headed by Morarji Desai, who became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. Fernandes won the Muzaffarpur seat in Bihar by an over 300,000 vote margin in 1977 from jail where he was lodged in the Baroda dynamite case, despite his not even visiting the constituency.

On 28 March 1977, he was appointed as Minister of Post and Telegraph. In his speech, on 31 March 1977, in Lok Sabha, he emphasised on expanding postal services to rural areas. On 7 July 1977, he was appointed the Union Minister for Industries. During his union ministership, he clashed with American multinationals IBM and Coca-Cola insisting they implement FERA, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, which had been passed under Indira Gandhi&#x27;s government. Under the FERA, foreign investors could not own more than 40 per cent of the share capital in Indian enterprises. The two multinationals decided to shut down their Indian operations, when Fernandes pressed ahead with rigid enforcement of FERA. On 1 May 1978, he launched District Industrial Centre to provide employment in rural areas.

During his first tenure as MP, Fernandes set up a Doordarshan Kendra (1978), Kanti Thermal Power Station (1978) and the Lijjat papad factory to generate employment in Muzaffarpur. Fernandes also insisted on women&#x27;s empowerment. In November 2014, Kanti Thermal Power Station was renamed as George Fernandes Thermal Power Station (GFTPS).

In November 1978, he sent his resignation letter to Desai to work for the organization of Janata Party, which was rejected. On 12 July 1979, speaking on Motion of no confidence brought by Yashwantrao Chavan, George Fernandes defended Morarji Desai&#x27;s government. But on 15 July 1979, George along with other ministers like Biju Patnaik, Purushottam Kaushik, Bhanu Pratap Singh resigned from Desai&#x27;s cabinet.

===Party memberships and railway ministry===

During his tenure as a minister in the Janata Party, he continued to be uncomfortable with certain elements of the broad-based Janata coalition, especially with the leaders of the erstwhile Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Jan Sangh in the Union Cabinet. In a debate preceding a vote of confidence two years into the government&#x27;s tenure in 1979, he vehemently spoke out against the practice of permitting members to retain connections to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) while being in the ministry in the Janata Party. The leaders of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, among them Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani, refused to give up their allegiance with the RSS, leading to a split within the Janata Party. The issue of &quot;dual membership&quot; caused Morarji Desai to lose the vote of confidence, and his government was reduced to a minority in the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot;. After the Janata Party started disintegrating in 1979, Charan Singh left it to form the Janata (Secular) Party and with support from the Congress Party, replaced Desai as prime minister.

In the seventh general elections held in 1980, the Janata (Secular) ministry failed to maintain a majority in the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot;, and Congress once again became the ruling party. Fernandes retained his Parliamentary seat from Muzaffarpur in 1980, and sat in the opposition. He contested for the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot; in 1984 from Bangalore North constituency against future Railway minister and Congress candidate C. K. Jaffer Sheriff, but lost the election by a margin of 40,000 votes. He then decided to shift his base to Bihar in 1989, when an anti-Congress wave was sweeping the country in the wake of the Bofors scandal, and won Muzaffarpur in the 1989 and 1991 general elections, He later joined the Janata Dal, a party which was formed from the Janata Party at Bangalore in August 1988. His second tenure as Minister of Railways in the V. P. Singh&#x27;s government from 1989 to 1990, though short-lived, was quite eventful. He was one of the driving forces behind the Konkan Railway project, the first major development in the Rail transport in India#History since independence.

Fernandes broke away from the erstwhile Janata Dal and formed the Samata Party in 1994, which became a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP formed a short-lived government in the 1996 general elections along with the Samata Party and other allies. The government survived only for 13 days, since the BJP could not gather enough support from other parties to form a majority. Fernandes later served in the opposition along with BJP during the two United Front governments (1996–1998) led by Janata Dal ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral. After the collapse of the United Front ministry led by Gujral, BJP and its allies won a slender majority in the 1998 general elections. The government lasted only for 13 months, due to the non-co-operation of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader Jayalalithaa.

After the collapse of the second BJP-led coalition government, BJP and its allies formed a 24 party alliance called National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which became the first non-Congress coalition government in post-independence India to survive a full five-year term (1999–2004). Later, Fernandes became the convenor of NDA. On 27 July 1999, the Janata Dal again split into two factions, the Janata Dal (United) and the Janata Dal (Secular). In 2003, Fernandes reunited with the Janata Dal (United), and also merged his Samata Party with it.

===Defence minister===
Fernandes served as the Defence Minister of India in both the first and second National Democratic Alliance governments (1998–2004). During his tenure as the defence minister, the Kargil war over Kashmir broke out between India and Pakistan in 1999. The war began when heavily armed Pakistan-backed intruders dug themselves in at heights of  – on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC) along an stretch north of Kargil. They began attacking the strategic highway linking Srinagar and Leh. As a result, the Indian army undertook the Operation Vijay to push back the Pakistani intruders and regain the occupied territories. The inability of the Indian intelligence and military agencies to detect the infiltration early received criticism, both by the opposition as well as the media. However, Fernandes refused to acknowledge the failure of intelligence agencies in detecting infiltration along Kargil sector.

In May 1998, India conducted five nuclear tests at the Pokharan range in Rajasthan. Earlier a staunch supporter of nuclear disarmament, Fernandes openly endorsed the NDA government&#x27;s decision to test the nuclear bombs. He was also involved in skirmishes with the then Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy, Vishnu Bhagwat, over promotion of Vice-Admiral Harinder Singh as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. Bhagwat was subsequently sacked over the issue. After the Tehelka defence scandal broke out in March 2001, Fernandes quit as defence minister, but was reappointed to the post later. Fernandes is the only defence minister of a nuclear power who had a picture of Hiroshima bombing in his office. He made 18 visits to the icy heights of the Siachen glacier in Kashmir, which holds the record of being &quot;the world&#x27;s highest battlefield&quot;. He was known for overseeing a huge increase in India&#x27;s defence budget as compared to the allocations made by previous governments.

===After the defence ministership===
The NDA Government lost power to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in the 2004 general elections. On 11 October 2004, George Fernandes along with Chandra Shekhar and Subramanian Swamy formed Rashtriya Swabhiman Manch to oppose Sonia Gandhi and policies adopted by the UPA government.

Later, political observers alleged that Fernandes was locked in a bitter party rivalry with his one-time friend, Samata Party co-founder, Nitish Kumar. In the 2009 general elections, he contested from Muzaffarpur as an independent candidate after being denied a ticket by the Janata Dal (United) on health grounds, but he lost the election. On 30 July 2009, Fernandes filed his nomination as an independent candidate for the mid-term poll being held for the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav. The Janata Dal (United) did not field any candidate against him, which led to his being elected unopposed. He was sworn in on 4 August 2009.

==Reception==
===Support to secessionist groups in Sri Lanka===
Fernandes supported and endorsed many secessionist movements and groups. He was a long time supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an organisation which sought to create an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka. Before 1997, he organised a controversial public convention of pro-LTTE delegates in New Delhi. In July 1998, he reportedly prevented the Indian Navy from intercepting ships that were suspected of carrying illegal weapons to Tamil guerrilla groups. Fernandes was also a patron of the Fund Raising Committee backed by the LTTE, with an objective to help the 26 accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The Sri Lankan government stated that, &quot;the LTTE&#x27;s biggest supporter in India is Defence Minister George Fernandes.&quot; He also expressed support for Tibetan refugees fighting for freedom against China, and Burmese pro-democratic rebel groups fighting against the military government in Myanmar.

He revealed the infamous &quot;Operation Leech&quot; incident, which resulted in the capture of Arakan Army insurgents in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He also fought for the welfare and release of anti-Burmese rebels held by the Indian Government.

===CIA funding===

During the Emergency, as chairman of the Socialist Party of India, he faced prosecution for alleged conspiracy against the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He allegedly sought to obtain funding from the US Central Intelligence Agency and the French government to organise underground sabotage activities. US diplomatic cables said that after an initial request to seek funding from the French government was turned down, he was &quot;prepared to accept money from the CIA&quot;.

===Tehelka scandal===

Fernandes&#x27; name figured prominently in Operation West End, a sting operation in which journalist Mathew Samuel, armed with hidden cameras, from a controversial investigative journal, Tehelka, posing as representatives of a fictitious arms company, appeared to bribe the Bharatiya Janata Party President, Bangaru Laxman, a senior officer in the Indian Army and Jaya Jaitly, the General Secretary of the Samata Party and Fernandes&#x27; companion.

The scandal caused uproar all over India and Fernandes was forced to resign from his post as Defence Minister. He was subsequently cleared by the one man commission headed by retired Justice Phukan. The Phukan Committee Report was rejected by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government headed by the Congress Party and a new committee headed by Justice K Venkataswami was appointed. The Committee investigated the case in detail, but Justice Venkataswami resigned before submitting the report in the case.

===Barak Missile scandal===

On 10 October 2006, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a First information report (FIR) against Fernandes, his associate Jaya Jaitly, and former navy chief Admiral Sushil Kumar for alleged irregularities in purchasing the Barak 1 system from Israel in 2000. Fernandes, however, said that the scientific adviser to the Defence Minister in National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government (1998–2004), who later became the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, had cleared the missile deal.

===As defence minister===
Following the Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998, he openly branded China as &quot;India&#x27;s enemy number one&quot;. He later expressed regret for his statements, saying it was wrongly interpreted by the media. He has also criticised China for providing sophisticated weapons to Pakistan to build its missiles, and has rapped the Chinese for strengthening their military across the Himalayas in Tibet.

Fernandes has claimed that he was strip searched twice at Dulles Airport in the US Capital area, when he was defence minister—once on an official visit to Washington in early 2002 and another time while en route to Brazil in mid-2003. The details of the strip-search were mentioned in American foreign policy analyst Strobe Talbott&#x27;s book &quot;Engaging India – Diplomacy, Democracy and the Bomb&quot;. However, the US embassy in Delhi issued a formal denial that Fernandes had been strip-searched, and said that, &quot;Fernandes was not strip-searched but a security wand was waved over him when a key in his pocket set off the metal detector.&quot; Subsequently, the then United States Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, personally apologised to Fernandes over the matter. This was one in a series of incidents involving the detention and search of Indian VIPs at US airports that marred Indian–US relations post 9/11.

He was accused in the 2002 coffin scam, following allegations that 500 poor quality aluminium caskets were bought from the United States at rates 13 times more than the actual price, to transport the bodies of slain soldiers, after the Kargil War. However, the CBI gave a clean sheet to Fernandes in the scam in its 2009 charge sheet.

== Positions held ==
==Writings, journalism and other contributions==

Fernandes liked writing and journalism in his student days. He was the editor of a Konkani language monthly &quot;Konkani Yuvak&quot; (Konkani Youth) in 1949. The same year, he was the editor of the &quot;Raithavani&quot; weekly in Kannada. The &quot;Dockman&quot; weekly in English, which had ceased publication, reappeared under the editorship of Fernandes in 1952–53. Though not a prolific writer, Fernandes wrote several books on politics including &quot;What Ails the Socialists&quot; (1972), &quot;Socialist Communist Interaction in India&quot;, &quot;In the year of the disabled: India&#x27;s disabled government&quot; (1981), &quot;Dignity for All: Essays in Socialism and Democracy&quot; (1991), and his autobiography titled &quot;George Fernandes Speaks&quot; (1991). He was the editor of an English monthly, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, and the chairman of the editorial board of the Hindi monthly &quot;Pratipaksh&quot;. A human rights activist, Fernandes had been a member of Amnesty International, the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties and the Press Council of India.
In the year 2022, a Canada-based Mangalorean origin writer &quot;Chris Emmanuel Dsouza&quot; published a book titled &quot;Bandh Samrat – Tales of eternal rebel &quot; that chronicled George Fernandes&#x27;s early days of Trade union activism in his hometown of Mangalore, his early slog in his adopted city of Bombay and his association with stellar socialist figures of Mangalore like the noted Ammembala Balappa and Placid D’Mello.

==Family and personal life==
Fernandes met Leila Kabir, the daughter of former Union minister Humayun Kabir, on a flight back to Delhi from Calcutta. Fernandes, then the general secretary of the Samyukta Socialist Party, was returning from Bangladesh while Kabir was on her way back from the battlefront where she had gone as an assistant director of the Red Cross. They began dating and were married on 22 July 1971. They had a son, Sean Fernandes, who is an investment banker based in New York. Fernandes and Kabir separated in the mid-1980s. Jaya Jaitly was Fernandes&#x27; companion from 1984.

Fernandes spoke ten languages—Konkani, English, Hindi, Tulu, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Malayalam, and Latin. Konkani was his mother tongue. He learnt Marathi and Urdu in jail, and Latin while he was in the seminary in his early youth. He was fluent in Hindi and English.

Fernandes was reported to be suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s diseases, and in January 2010 was undergoing treatment at Baba Ramdev&#x27;s ashram at Haridwar for the diseases at the request of Leila Kabir, who had recently returned to his life. In February 2010, Fernandes&#x27; brothers were reported to have been considering a court order for medical treatment and visitation; Kabir and Sean Fernandes are alleged to have forcibly removed Fernandes to an undisclosed location. In July 2010, the Delhi High Court ruled that Fernandes would stay with Kabir and that Fernandes&#x27; brothers would be able to visit.

In August 2012 the Supreme Court of India granted permission to Jaya Jaitly, a former aide, to visit him, a move which was opposed by his wife on the grounds of her &quot;locus standi&quot;.

He died at the age of 88 on 29 January 2019, in Delhi following a swine flu infection.

<text>Constantin Mugur Isărescu (; born 1 August 1949) is the governor of the National Bank of Romania, a position he has been holding since September 1990, with the sole exception of a period of time of one year (22 December 1999 to 28 December 2000), during which he served as Prime Minister of Romania. In addition, he is also a member of the Romanian Academy.

==Early life==
Isărescu was born in Drăgășani, Vâlcea County, Romania. His father was a school teacher who, after the establishment of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic, studied at the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest (ASE), worked as a bank executive during the 1950s, and then was a professor of accounting for 20 years.

Isărescu studied international trade at the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, which he graduated in 1971, and where he was an assistant professor between 1975 and 1989. In 1989, Isărescu defended his Ph.D. thesis on exchange rate policies under the supervision of Costin Kirițescu.

For 19 years, he worked as a researcher for the Institute of International Economics. He took a number of courses in the United States, writing several papers on capitalist economics. Isărescu claims it was as if he prepared for 20 years for the 1990 moment.

During this period he gave notes under several aliases to the Communist Secret Services about ladies with different problems, about colleagues at the institute, and about the foreigners he was meeting. One alias Isărescu used to sign the information notes to the Securitate was &quot;Manole&quot;.

In February 1990, after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, he began working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In March 1990, he was sent to work as an economic and monetary affairs secretary at the Romanian Embassy in the United States, being in charge of handling Romania&#x27;s relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

He expected that Romania would need IMF help within a couple of years, but he was surprised to find that the government depleted the foreign-exchange reserves within six months and, as such, he was recalled to Romania in July 1990 to head the National Bank.

==Governor of the National Bank of Romania==
In September 1990, he was named Governor of the National Bank of Romania by the Romanian government. During the early years, he negotiated several agreements with the International Monetary Fund. His mandate was renewed by the Parliament of Romania in 1991, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 and 2024.

According to a World Record Academy article, Isărescu managed in 19 years of leadership at the National Bank of Romania to create and maintain a mysterious aura around the policies of the National Bank, and many pointed out that the agenda of the Bank remained independent from any Romanian Government. The same article states that many credit the National Bank team for saving Romania&#x27;s economy from a Bulgarian-type collapse, raising the national gold and Euro reserves beyond needs, cutting down inflation to single-digit figures and introducing the New Leu. In 2009, the World Record Academy named him as the longest-serving governor of a central bank.

He was involved in a series of legislative debates regarding some consumer protection laws, as &quot;datio in solutium&quot; and Swiss franc to Romanian leu conversion, when he had a pronounced role, strongly supporting banks against Romanian debtors, in last two years.

==Prime Minister of Romania==
In 1999, Isărescu was asked to become Prime Minister of Romania, which he accepted on the condition that he could return to the National Bank after it was over. Then-President Emil Constantinescu agreed with the terms and on 16 December 1999 Isărescu was sworn in as Prime Minister of Romania, but only for about a year, since in November 2000, the ruling coalition lost the election.

In November 2000 Isărescu ran for President of Romania but was soundly defeated, coming in fourth place and receiving 9% of the vote. Thereafter, he returned to the National Bank of Romania for another term as governor.

Although Isărescu served only one year as Prime Minister, Isărescu is considered to have started the reform process, continued later by Adrian Năstase and Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. During his premiership, on February 15, 2000, Romania formally initiated negotiations with the European Union (a process started by the Romanian application in 1995 and European Commission approval on October 13, 1999). As governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isărescu has coordinated Romania&#x27;s economic policy since 1990.

Isărescu was considered several times between 2009 and 2012 as a suitable replacement for Emil Boc as Prime Minister of Romania. Isărescu declined the offer from President Băsescu, refusing to re-assume his former office in order to remain Governor of BNR.

<doc id="480669" wikidata="Q410142" url="?curid=480669" title="Serotonin transporter">
<text>The serotonin transporter (SERT or 5-HTT) also known as the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and solute carrier family 6 member 4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC6A4 gene. SERT is a type of monoamine transporter protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin from the synaptic cleft back to the presynaptic neuron, in a process known as serotonin reuptake.

This transport of serotonin by the SERT protein terminates the action of serotonin and recycles it in a sodium-dependent manner. Many antidepressant medications of the SSRI and tricyclic antidepressant classes work by binding to SERT and thus reducing serotonin reuptake. It is a member of the family. A repeat length polymorphism in the promoter of this gene has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin uptake and may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome, aggressive behavior in Alzheimer disease patients, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression-susceptibility in people experiencing emotional trauma.

== Mechanism of action ==
Serotonin-reuptake transporters are dependent on both the concentration of potassium ion in the cytoplasm and the concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the extracellular fluid. In order to function properly the serotonin transporter requires the membrane potential created by the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase.

The serotonin transporter first binds a sodium ion, followed by the serotonin, and then a chloride ion; it is then allowed, thanks to the membrane potential, to flip inside the cell freeing all the elements previously bound. Right after the release of the serotonin in the cytoplasm a potassium ion binds to the transporter which is now able to flip back out returning to its active state.

== Function ==
The serotonin transporter removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft back into the synaptic boutons. Thus, it terminates the effects of serotonin and simultaneously enables its reuse by the presynaptic neuron.

Neurons communicate by using chemical messengers like serotonin between cells. The transporter protein, by recycling serotonin, regulates its concentration in a gap, or synapse, and thus its effects on a receiving neuron&#x27;s receptors.

Medical studies have shown that changes in serotonin transporter metabolism appear to be associated with many different phenomena, including alcoholism, clinical depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), romantic love, hypertension and generalized social phobia.

The serotonin transporter is also present in platelets; there, serotonin functions as a vasoconstrictive substance. It also serves as a signalling molecule to induce platelet aggregation.

==Pharmacology==

In 1995 and 1996, scientists in Europe had identified the polymorphism 5-HTTLPR, a serotonin-transporter in the gene &quot;SLC6A4&quot;. In December 1996, a group of researchers led by D.A. Collier of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, published their findings in &quot;Molecular Psychiatry&quot;, that, &quot;5-HTTLPR-dependent variation in functional 5-HTT expression is a potential genetic susceptibility factor for affective disorders.&quot;

SERT spans the plasma membrane 12 times. It belongs to the NE, DA, SERT monoamine transporter family. Transporters are important sites for agents that treat psychiatric disorders. Drugs that reduce the binding of serotonin to transporters (serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SRIs) are used to treat mental disorders. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine are examples of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Following the elucidation of structures of the homologous bacterial transporter, LeuT, co-crystallized with tricyclic antidepressants in the vestibule leading from the extracellular space to the central substrate site it was inferred that this binding site did also represent the binding site relevant for antidepressant binding in SERT. However, studies on SERT showed that tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors bind to the central binding site overlapping the substrate binding site. The &quot;Drosophila&quot; dopamine transporter, which displays a pharmacology similar to SERT, was crystallized with tricyclic antidepressants and confirmed the earlier finding that the substrate binding site is also the antidepressant binding site.

==Genetics==
|
The gene that encodes the serotonin transporter is called &quot;solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin), member 4&quot; (SLC6A4, see Solute carrier family).
In humans the gene is found on chromosome 17 on location 17q11.1–q12.

Mutations associated with the gene may result in changes in serotonin transporter function, and experiments with mice have identified more than 50 different phenotypic changes as a result of genetic variation.
These phenotypic changes may, e.g., be increased anxiety and gut dysfunction.
Some of the human genetic variations associated with the gene are:
* Length variation in the serotonin-transporter-gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR)
* rs25531 — a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5-HTTLPR
* rs25532 — another SNP in the 5-HTTLPR
* STin2 — a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the functional intron 2
* G56A on the second exon
* I425V on the ninth exon

=== Length variation in 5-HTTLPR ===
According to a 1996 article in &quot;The Journal of Neurochemistry&quot;, the promoter region of the SLC6A4 gene contains a polymorphism with &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; repeats in a region: 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR or &quot;SERTPR&quot;).
The short variation has 14 repeats of a sequence while the long variation has 16 repeats. A second 1996 article stated that the short variation leads to less transcription for SLC6A4, and it has been found that it can partly account for anxiety-related personality traits. This polymorphism has been extensively investigated in over 300 scientific studies (as of 2006). The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism may be subdivided further:
One study published in 2000 found 14 allelic variants (14-A, 14-B, 14-C, 14-D, 15, 16-A, 16-B, 16-C, 16-D, 16-E, 16-F, 19, 20 and 22) in a group of around 200 Japanese and Caucasian people.

In addition to altering the expression of SERT protein and concentrations of extracellular serotonin in the brain, the 5-HTTLPR variation is associated with changes in brain structure. One 2005 study found less grey matter in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala for short allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism compared to subjects with the long/long genotype.

In contrast, a 2008 meta-analysis found no significant overall association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and autism. A hypothesized gene–environment interaction between the short/short allele of the 5-HTTLPR and life stress as predictor for major depression has suffered a similar fate: after an influential initial report in 2003 there were mixed results in replication in 2008, and a 2009 meta-analysis was negative. See 5-HTTLPR for more information.

=== rs25532 ===
rs25532 is a SNP (C&gt;T) close to the site of 5-HTTLPR.
It has been examined in connection with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

=== I425V ===
I425V is a rare mutation on the ninth exon.
In 2003, researchers from Japan and the US reported that they had found this genetic variation in unrelated families with OCD, and have found that it leads to faulty transporter function and regulation. A second variant in the same gene of some patients with this mutation suggests a genetic &quot;double hit&quot;, resulting in greater biochemical effects and more severe symptoms.

=== VNTR in STin2 ===
Another noncoding polymorphism is a VNTR in the second intron (STin2). In a 2005 study, it was found with three alleles: 9, 10 and 12 repeats.
A meta-analysis has found that the 12 repeat allele of the STin2 VNTR polymorphism had some minor (with odds ratio 1.24), but statistically significant, association with schizophrenia.
A 2008 meta-analysis found no significant overall association between the STin2 VNTR polymorphism and autism.
Furthermore, a 2003 meta-analysis of affective disorders, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, found a minor association to the intron 2 VNTR polymorphism, but the results of the meta-analysis were dependent upon a large effect from one individual study.

The polymorphism has also been related to personality traits with a 2008 Russian study finding individuals with the STin2.10 allele having lower neuroticism scores as measured with the Eysenck Personality Inventory.

== Neuroimaging ==
The distribution of the serotonin transporter in the brain may be imaged with positron emission tomography using radioligands called DASB and DAPP; the first such studies on the human brain were reported in 2000. DASB and DAPP are not the only radioligands for the serotonin transporter. There are numerous others, with the most popular probably being the β-CIT radioligand with an iodine-123 isotope that is used for brain scanning with &quot;single-photon emission computed tomography&quot; (SPECT) according to a 1993 article in the &quot;Journal of Neural Transmission&quot;. The radioligands were used in 2006 to examine whether variables such as age, gender or genotype are associated with differential serotonin transporter binding. Healthy subjects that have a high score of neuroticism—a personality trait in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory—were found to have more serotonin transporter binding in the thalamus in 2007.

== Neuroimaging and genetics ==
Studies on the serotonin transporter have combined neuroimaging and genetics methods, e.g., a voxel-based morphometry study found less grey matter in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala for short allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism compared to subjects with the long/long genotype.

<text>The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is a high performance sports training institution in Australia. The institute&#x27;s headquarters were opened in 1981 and are situated in the northern suburb of Bruce, Canberra. The AIS is a division of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), part of the Australian Government under the Department of Health and Aged Care.

==History==

Two reports were the basis for developing the AIS: &quot;The Role, Scope and Development of Recreation in Australia (1973)&quot; by John Bloomfield and &quot;Report of the Australian Sports Institute Study Group (1975)&quot; (group chaired by Allan Coles). The need for the AIS was compounded in 1976 when the Australian Olympic team failed to win a gold medal at the Montreal Olympics, which was regarded as a national embarrassment for Australia. The institute&#x27;s well-funded programs (and more generally the generous funding for elite sporting programs by Australian and State Governments) have been regarded as a major reason for Australia&#x27;s recent success in international sporting competitions.

In 2011, Minister for Sport Mark Arbib announced the AIS would take responsibility for the strategic direction of high performance sport in Australia. In November 2012, the ASC released &quot;Australia&#x27;s Winning Edge 2012–2022&quot;, a high performance sport plan, which highlighted a new role for the AIS particularly in terms of developing coaches and talent identification but not directly managing national sports organisations elite athlete programs as it had done since 1981.

=== Timeline ===
A brief overview of the history of the AIS follows.

==Institute==
The AIS employs a number of staff who primarily work in Sports Science and Sports Medicine, which includes disciplines such as sports nutrition, performance analysis, skill acquisition, physiology, recovery, biomechanics, athlete career education, strength and conditioning, psychology, physical therapies, talent identification, and applied performance research.

There are a number of sculptures located throughout the Bruce Campus, such as &#x27;Acrobats&#x27;, &#x27;Gymnast&#x27;, &#x27;Pole Vaulter&#x27; and &#x27;Soccer Players&#x27; by John Robinson and the &#x27;Swimmer&#x27; by Guy Boyd. After the Sydney 2000 Olympics, two of the three sculptures - &#x27; Gymnast&#x27; and &#x27;Wheelchair Basketballer&#x27; - that were located on the Sydney Tower Eye prior to the Olympics were installed at the AIS.

The AIS Arena is a 4,200 capacity indoor stadium which has been used for sports such as basketball, gymnastics and volleyball as well as music concerts. Directly adjacent to, but not strictly part of the institute is the 25,000 capacity outdoor Canberra Stadium which has hosted matches of all the major forms of football played in Australia.

In 2005, 2009, and 2010 the institute won awards at the prestigious Canberra and Capital Region Tourism Awards. These awards were given in recognition of the daily public tours that are available. Each tour, which takes in several different buildings of the institute as well as the arena and the Sportex zone, is led by an athlete currently training there.

==Logo==
Shortly after its inception in 1981, the AIS held a competition for a symbol that would depict the AIS aim of &quot;achieving supremacy in sport&quot;. Over 500 designs were submitted. The winner was Rose-Marie Derrico, a design student from Bendigo, Victoria. Her design showed an athlete with hands clasped above the head in recognition of victory. The colours of the logo were red, white and blue, which are the same colours as the Australian flag.

On 3 February 2014, the AIS launched a new logo in line with its new direction as outlined in its Winning Edge program that was launched in 2012. Landor Associates designed the new brand and logo. The gold in the brand representing Australia&#x27;s pursuit of gold.

==National Training Centres==
From 2014, as a result of Australia&#x27;s Winning Edge 2012-2023 strategy, the AIS no longer directly offered scholarships to athletes. As a result of the strategy, many national sporting organisations are utilizing the AIS facilities and services on an ongoing or regular basis. Several national sports organisations have located their national centres for excellence at the AIS. These include: Basketball Australia Centre for Excellence, Netball Australia Centre for Excellence, Football Federation of Australia Centre of Excellence, Rowing Australia National Training Centre, Volleyball Australia Centre of Excellence, and Swimming Australia National Training Centre.

The AIS does continue to support other athletes in other sports however they are self funded and not under the National Training Centre banner.

==Former sports programs==
Up until 2013, the AIS offered scholarships to athletes across 36 programs in 26 different sports:
* Artistic gymnastics, athletes with disabilities - swimming, athletics and winter sports, basketball, netball, rowing, football (men &amp; women), tennis, swimming, track and field, volleyball (men) and water polo (women) administered from Canberra
* Diving, squash, softball and cricket (men &amp; women) administered from Brisbane
* Sailing and slalom canoeing administered from Sydney
* Hockey administered from Perth
* Sprint canoeing, triathlon and BMX administered from the Gold Coast
* Road cycling, track cycling and beach volleyball administered from Adelaide
* Australian rules football, rugby union and rugby league are camps based programs
* Winter sports (in partnership with the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia) administered from Melbourne
Sports that previously had an AIS program but were discontinued prior to 2013 included: weightlifting, water polo (men), volleyball (women), wrestling, shooting, archery, boxing (1997 - 2010) and golf. .

The head coach for the AIS boxing program from 1997 to 2010 was Bodo Andreass.

==Notable athletes==
Many prominent Australian athletes have taken up AIS scholarships. In 2001, the AIS established the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; Award to recognise highly performed AIS athletes. As of 2011, the following athletes have been recognised - Alisa Camplin, Robert De Castella, John Eales, Simon Fairweather, Neil Fuller, Bridgette Gusterson, Rechelle Hawkes, Shane Kelly, Luc Longley, Michelle Martin, Glenn McGrath, Michael Klim, Michael Milton, Clint Robinson, Louise Sauvage, Kate Slatter, Zali Steggall, Mark Viduka, Vicki Wilson, Todd Woodbridge, Lauren Jackson, Chantelle Newbery, Petria Thomas, Kerry Saxby-Junna, Jamie Dwyer, Anna Meares, Malcolm Page, Ricky Ponting, Oenone Wood and Matthew Cowdrey. In August 2013, Stuart O&#x27;Grady was indefinitely suspended from the &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27; due to his admission to doping in 1998.

The Australian Institute of Sport Alumni highlights the many prominent Australian athletes that the AIS has assisted.

=== Athlete of the Year ===
Since 1984, the AIS has named an Athlete of the Year. For the first twenty years, the award was predominately made to one athlete only. In 2004 a male and female athlete were awarded with the accolade; and the awarding has varied over the ensuing years.

==Notable coaches==
AIS was established to provide high level coaching to Australian athletes. Since its establishment in 1981, the AIS has employed highly credentialed Australian and international coaches. Original coaches were - Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley (swimming), Wilma Shakespear in netball, Adrian Hurley and Patrick Hunt (basketball), Peter Lloyd and Kazuyu Honda (gymnastics), Jimmy Shoulder (football), Ray Ruffels and Helen Gourlay (tennis), Kelvin Giles, Gary Knoke and Merv Kemp (track and field), and Lyn Jones (weightlifting).

Other notable AIS coaches - Charlie Walsh (cycling), Barry Dancer and Richard Charlesworth(hockey), Terry Gathercole (swimming), Marty Clarke (basketball).

==Sports medicine and sport science==
AIS established sports medicine and sports science services and research programs when established in 1981. Dr Dick Telford was its first Co-ordinator of Sports Science and Medicine. Other notable staff have included: Dr Peter Fricker, Professor Allan Hahn, Professor Louise Burke, Dr Bruce Mason and Keith Lyons.

The current Chief Medical Officer of the AIS is David Hughes. The AIS Sports Medicine department in 2020 released guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in athletes and a template for return to sport in Australia after the Coronavirus lockdown. These guidelines were used by the Australian government National Cabinet and the various Australian state governments to recommend stages for recommencing sport after the vast majority closed down in late March to early May 2020. Generally the doctors working at the AIS have been sports medicine specialists qualified through the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians.

In March 2022 the AIS released the National High Performance Sport Research Agenda, designed to prioritise resources in areas of critical importance to Australia&#x27;s high performance sport system. In July 2022 the AIS awarded grants to six Australian research teams, aimed at optimising the performance of alite athletes, coaches and support staff. The document &quot;Recommendations for conducting AIS-supported research in high performance sport&quot; was also released in 2022. The National Sport Research Agenda was released in December 2022.

==Olympic Winter Institute of Australia==

The AIS and the Australian Olympic Committee formed the Australian Institute of Winter Sports after the 1998 Winter Olympics. The organisation was renamed to the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia on 1 July 2001. It provides training in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (including aerial and mogul), snowboarding, short track speed skating and figure skating. It is also a partner with the AIS in skeleton (toboganning).

== Elite Athlete Education Network ==

The Elite Athlete Education Network (EAEN), formerly known as the Elite Athlete Friendly Universities (EAFU) network, is a network of universities and other education providers who are committed to supporting elite student athletes in partnership with the Australian Institute of Sport. The guiding principles which underpin the network include:

*Appointing a dedicated staff contact to support elite student athletes during their studies. This contact is responsible for advising student athletes in regard to academic planning, as well as supporting flexible arrangements to fulfil academic requirements. 
*Tailoring or developing flexible study options to support the needs of elite student athletes.

== Basketball program ==
The AIS Men&#x27;s Basketball Program played in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) between 1982 and 2010. The team was coached by Patrick Hunt from 1982 to 1992, then Gordie McLeod (1993–97), Frank Arsego (1998–2002), and Marty Clarke (2003–10). They made the playoffs just six times, but behind coach Arsego and future NBA player Andrew Bogut, the AIS won the 2002 East Conference championship. They went on to lose 98–93 to the Hobart Chargers in the 2002 National Championship game. Following the 2010 season, the program had a change of direction and withdrew from the SEABL.
In 2014, after Basketball Australia assumed responsibility of the AIS basketball program, the team returned to the SEABL under a new moniker, the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence (BA CoE). The AIS women&#x27;s team originally played in the WNBL from 1983 to 2012, before being resurrected in 2014 alongside the men&#x27;s team, thus entering the SEABL for the first time.

Both teams were ineligible for the playoffs between 2014 and 2017 due to not playing full seasons. With a change to playing full seasons in 2018, both teams became eligible for the playoffs for the first time. Following the demise of the SEABL, both BA Centre of Excellence teams played in the inaugural NBL1 season in 2019.

In 2020 and 2021, both BA Centre of Excellence teams competed in the Waratah League. The men&#x27;s team were crowned co-champions of the 2021 season.

In 2022, both BA Centre of Excellence teams were entered into the NBL1 as part of a Wildcard conference playing against the top teams from all five NBL1 State Conferences.

In 2023, both BA Centre of Excellence teams played in the NBL1 East.

<text>Essence () has various meanings and uses for different thinkers and in different contexts. It is used in philosophy and theology as a designation for the property or set of properties or attributes that make an entity the entity it is or, expressed negatively, without which it would lose its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property or attribute the entity has accidentally or contingently, but upon which its identity does not depend.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;essence&quot; comes from Latin &quot;essentia&quot;, via French &quot;essence&quot;. The original Latin word was created purposefully, by Ancient Roman philosophers, in order to provide an adequate Latin translation for the Greek term &quot;ousia&quot;. 

The concept originates as a precise technical term with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato), who used the Greek expression &quot;to ti ên einai&quot; literally meaning &quot;the what it was to be&quot;. This also corresponds to the scholastic term quiddity or sometimes the shorter phrase &quot;to ti esti&quot; literally meaning &quot;the what it is&quot; and corresponding to the scholastic term haecceity (thisness) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word &quot;essentia&quot; to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (&quot;horismos&quot;).

Stoic philosopher Seneca (d. 65 AD) attributed creation of the word to Cicero (d. 43 BC), while rhetor Quintilian (d. 100 AD) claimed that the word was created much earlier, by the stoic philosopher Sergius Plautus (&quot;sec.&quot; I AD).

Early use of the term is also attested in works of Apuleius (d. 170 AD) and Tertullian (d. 240 AD). During Late Antiquity, the term was often used in Christian theology, and through the works of Augustine (d. 430), Boethius (d. 524) and later theologians, who wrote in Medieval Latin, it became the basis for consequent creation of derived terms in many languages.

Thomas Aquinas, in his commentary on &quot;De hebdomadibus&quot; (Book II) by Boethius, states that in this work the distinction between essence (&quot;id quod est&quot;, what the thing is) and Being (&quot;esse&quot;) was introduced for the first time. Whereas the Being participated in entities is infinite and infinitely perfect, the essence — and not the matter — delimits the perfection of the Being in entities and makes them finite.

==Philosophy==
===Ontological status===
In his dialogues Plato suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to &quot;forms&quot;abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms of which sensible things are &quot;copies&quot;. Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato&#x27;s reckoning, less real than the forms which are eternal, unchanging, and complete. Typical examples of forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty, and justice.

According to nominalists such as William of Ockham, universals are not concrete entities, just names (i.e., labels); there are only individuals. Universals are words that can call to several individuals; for example, the word &quot;homo&quot;. Therefore, a universal is reduced to a spoken sound (according to Roscelin), or the (mental) concept to which it corresponds (as Ockham had it)—rather than a substantial, actual &quot;thing&quot; that exists outside of these contexts.

John Locke distinguished between &quot;real essences&quot; and &quot;nominal essences&quot;. Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.

According to Edmund Husserl, essence is &quot;ideal&quot;. However, &quot;ideal&quot; means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as &quot;sense&quot;.

===Existentialism===
Existentialism is often summed up by Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s statement that for human beings &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, which he understood as a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him. Instead of &quot;is-ness&quot; generating &quot;actuality,&quot; he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward.

In this respect he breaks with Søren Kierkegaard, who, although often described as a proto-existentialist, identified essence as &quot;nature.&quot; For him, there is no such thing as &quot;human nature&quot; that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be. First, he or she exists, and then comes property. Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.

Thus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to:
* a physical aspect or property;
* the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals); or
* the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.

==Religion==
===Buddhism===
Within the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, Candrakirti identifies the self as &quot;an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is selflessness&quot;. Buddhapālita adds, while commenting on Nagārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, &quot;What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them&quot;.

For the Madhyamaka Buddhists, &#x27;Emptiness&#x27; (also known as Anatta or Anatman) is the strong assertion that:
* all phenomena are empty of any essence;
* anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis; and
* it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of all suffering.
However, the Madhyamaka also rejects the tenets of idealism, materialism or nihilism; instead, the ideas of &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;existence&quot;, along with any assertions that depend upon them, are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to relativism or pragmatism. For the Madhyamaka, replacement paradoxes such as Ship of Theseus are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

In Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika&quot; Chapter XV examines essence itself.

===Christianity===
Essence, nature, or substance in Christianity means what something is in itself and is distinguished from something&#x27;s accidents (appearance). For example, according to transubstantiation, the eucharistic bread and wine appear to be bread and wine, but are in actuality - that is, in essence - Jesus&#x27; body and blood.}} Another example is Jesus&#x27; teaching &quot;Stop judging by appearances, but judge justly.&quot; A third example is the Beatific Vision: the angels and saints in Heaven see God&#x27;s essence.

===Hinduism===

In understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one&#x27;s &quot;Swadharma&quot; (essence) and &quot;Swabhava&quot; (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one&#x27;s interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality – smarana – we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one&#x27;s samskaras and take control over them). Dharma is derived from the root &quot;dhr&quot; &quot;to hold.&quot; It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one&#x27;s dharma is to be righteous, to do one&#x27;s dharma is to do one&#x27;s duty (express one&#x27;s essence).

<text>The Broons (English: The Browns) is a comic strip in Scots published in the weekly Scottish newspaper &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;. It features the Brown (Broon) family, who live in a tenement flat at 10 Glebe Street (since the late 1990s) in the fictional Scottish town of Auchentogle or Auchenshoogle.

Created by writer/editor R. D. Low and artist Dudley D. Watkins, the strip made its first appearance in the issue dated 8 March 1936.

Since its inception, &quot;The Broons&quot; have had their own biennial, alternating each year with &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;. No annuals were published during 1943 and 1944 due to paper rationing in World War II, but jigsaws were created instead. Following the 80th anniversary in 2016, an additional annual of The Broons was issued for 2017, breaking from the biennial pattern.

==Characters==

The family members include:
*Paw Broon – the patriarch, a working man who occasionally tries to keep enough back for a bit of &quot;baccy&quot; (tobacco) and a bet on the horses. In a flashback to his youth, Paw was seen with his immediate family before he and Maw were married. His mother, Granmaw, was seen as well as his sister Daphne and brother Joseph. As Granpaw is a widower, and Aunt Daphne and Uncle Joseph are never seen, Paw has named two of his children after his siblings – his oldest daughter, Daphne, and his second son, Joe. With his comb-over hairstyle and walrus moustache, his appearance was supposedly based on A.C. &quot;Archie&quot; Brown, the chief editor of publisher D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd at the time &quot;The Broons&quot; originated. Paw disapproves of most young behaviour. He is a main character: there are very few strips where he is not featured. It is usually him who ends up being made the idiot of, after he has made a smart-alec comment. He is generally said to be still working at the shipyards. However, in a few strips, he is depicted as being retired.
*Maw Broon – the formidable mother of eight. She has to run every aspect of the household and keep her husband, Paw, in line. Her first name was once used when her brother came to visit. He burst into No. 10 addressing her as &quot;Maggie&quot; and looking for money for his taxi fare. The name Maggie was confirmed in &quot;Maw Broon&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;, published in 2007. Another book was &quot;The But an&#x27; Ben Cookbook&quot;, Waverley Books, 2008 (the book from the family&#x27;s holiday home, &quot;the wee hoose among the heather&quot;). In a 1980s strip, the opening rhyme featured her name as Maigret (Margaret) Broon as well but this never continued. Maw comes from a more upper-class background, as seen in &quot;Maw Broon&#x27;s Remedies &amp; Suchlike&quot; where her mother has given her the book as a present and writes about how Maw should stop seeing Paw. In earlier strips, she can be seen to make the family act rather posh and her daughters take after her by doing the same.
*Granpaw Broon – Paw&#x27;s widowed, 80-year-old father, lives in his own house and spends most of his time sitting on a park bench with his &quot;cronies&quot; (friends), or tending his allotment. He shares Paw&#x27;s preoccupation with having an ample supply of tobacco. Granpaw was a slightly later addition, not appearing in the earliest strips. In some of these, the family had a picture of Granpaw on their wall; it could do certain actions, such as wagging its finger at the children. Initially, Granpaw was portrayed in a bad light, as a miser and a scheming moocher but was later written as a loveable rogue often who gets into more mischief than his young grandchildren. It was revealed in &quot;Maw Broon&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; (2007) that his late wife was named Jeannie, a Scottish variation of &quot;Jean&quot; or &quot;Jenny&quot; that was once very popular. Granmaw was only seen twice, once in 1937, during a flashback of Maw and Paw&#x27;s courting days, and again in 1959, when comparing life to the old days.
*Hen (Henry) Broon – The lanky, awkward eldest son and firstborn child of Maw and Paw. About 31 years old. He is often taken advantage of for his height, for example, being made to act as a clothes pole to keep the washing line up. Early &quot;Broons&quot; cartoons featured Hen wearing a zoot suit. Hen is aspirational. For example, every couple of years or so he buys a car. Such purchases, however, always end in failure.
*Daphne Broon – The plump, somewhat dowdy daughter who is always playing second fiddle to her beautiful sister Maggie on double dates. Every few years she has a stroke of luck when the double dates get mixed up and she gets Maggie&#x27;s man. At least once a year, Daphne tries to go on a diet but fails to lose any weight. She is often mocked by Hen and Joe about her diets, although their taunts are intentionally harmless. Daphne is a skilled dressmaker but has a penchant for flamboyant hats.
*Joe (Joseph) Broon – the epitome of the ordinary working man, usually noted for his good looks, strength and love of sports and boxing. Joe is something of a ladies&#x27; man, and can sometimes be seen sharing a bitter rivalry with Hen over a beautiful woman, with Joe winning. Hen envies Joe&#x27;s luck with the girls, and the twins see him as a role model.
*Maggie (Margaret) Broon – The beautiful, glamorous daughter with blonde hair and fashionable clothing. She has a steady stream of beaux and is bitterly envied by the drab Daphne. In the later editions, Maggie became a model, and a . Despite their rivalry over men, Daphne and Maggie share a close bond and Maggie even stands up for Daphne when she is taunted; notably in one strip, she flirted with a man in a bar and threw the drink he had bought her over him as revenge for his hurtful comments toward Daphne.
*Horace Broon – A bookish and bespectacled teenage schoolboy forever trying to learn French or poetry by rote amidst the chaos of a do-it-yourself chimney-sweeping mishap or other domestic turmoil. He is quite pompous and likes to think of himself as an example to the twins, but recently seems to aspire to be like Joe (for example, purchasing muscle-building equipment). However, he is nowhere near as popular with girls as Joe. Horace is seen as a young teenager in the early years of secondary school. However, during the 1990s, his appearance was that of someone slightly older. 
*The Twins – Identical twin boys, who are in primary school. Although one is called Eck (short for &quot;Alexander&quot;), they are always referred to collectively, with few exceptions (such as Granpaw calling them &quot;ae twin&quot; and &quot;the ither twin&quot;). They are rambunctious youngsters and usually add to the chaos with a fistfight or a good game of cowboys and Indians.
*The Bairn – The youngest of the family at about four years of age. She is basically a smaller version of Maw, getting in her share of indignant moral pronouncements and pointing out the foolishness of the male Broons. She and Granpaw are deeply close. Her first name is never revealed; she is simply addressed as &quot;my wee lamb&quot;, &quot;dear&quot;, &quot;pet&quot; etc.

==Storylines==
The family surname &quot;Broon&quot; is the Scots for Standard English &quot;Brown&quot;, as indicated by the nameplate that occasionally appears on the front door of their flat. Also, when a family member is addressed by a non-Scot (i.e. an Englishman or an American), he or she is addressed as &quot;Mister (or Mrs or Miss) Brown&quot;.

Early strips written in the 1930s featured less dialogue and the pictures told the story. This was more common in &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; strips. However, occasional &quot;Broons&quot; strips did this too.

During the 1970s, stories drawn by Tom Lavery, another character named Dave MacKay was regularly featured. Dave was Maggie&#x27;s long-term boyfriend and later her fiancé, although the latter aspect only featured in the original Sunday Post strips, with all mentions of the engagement removed for the annual reprints. Although his father was an old school friend of Paw, his mother was upper–middle-class, much to the chagrin of Paw and Maw. Despite the Broons&#x27; perpetual deference to their social &#x27;betters&#x27;, many comical premises were built on the family&#x27;s attempts to impress members of the landed gentry, or the clergy. Many storylines featured Paw bringing shame on the family by being seen wearing torn trousers or working clothes by the &#x27;Meenister&#x27; (Church of Scotland minister). Maggie&#x27;s character also changed during this time, becoming more posh. Unlike the rest of the Broons, she spoke Standard English rather than Modern Scots. When Peter Davidson took over from Lavery, the character was dropped without explanation. The 2012 special annual &quot;The Broons and Oor Wullie: Classic Strips from the 70&#x27;s&quot; reveals the fate of the character which was created specially for this book.

Most of the humour derives from the timeless themes of the &quot;generation gap&quot;, stretching the money as far as possible, and the constant struggle for each family member to live in a very small flat with the other nine Broons. In the end, the family always support one another, getting through life with a gentle good humour as they argue amongst themselves.

Another staple of the series is misunderstanding: inevitably the bairn or the twins mishear something Granpaw or another family member says, and the whole family acts on it until the truth is revealed in the final panel. An example is where the twins are told by Daphne that she is bringing her boyfriend up to dinner and that he is half Polish and half French. While Maggie makes a French salad and Paw finds a flag from each country, Hen asks if they know the man&#x27;s name – Angus MacKay. Hen and Paw go with the twins to see his shop. It turns out he is a French-polisher – &quot;polish&quot; being pronounced the same as &quot;Polish&quot; in Scots.

==Locations==
As with &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;, Watkins left the location of the strips unnamed, although the Broons&#x27; tenement is located on Glebe Street, a commonly used name in many Scottish towns. However, as originally written, Watkins&#x27; use of words and phrases more commonly associated with the east coast of Scotland, such as &quot;bairn&quot; for &quot;child&quot;, as opposed to the west-central &quot;wean&quot;, suggests he was using his own immediate environment. (He lived in Broughty Ferry.) He worked in Dundee and the Broons&#x27; dialect is mainly Dundonian. Since the 1990s, however, &quot;The Broons&quot; has been set in the fictional town of Auchenshoogle.

The Broons own a small cottage, called the but and ben, somewhere in the Highlands but within a relatively short distance of their home. They enjoy weekends away there, although the younger Broons show some reluctance to go there. In a 1940s strip, the house is shown to be on a hillside on the east side of the River Ness and an arrow also points to Auchentoogle being located on the northern bank of Loch Ness near Dores. The house was referred to as being in a secret location in &quot;The Broons Days Oot&quot; travel guide published in 2009. In &quot;Still Game&quot;&#x27;s 2007 Hogmanay special, &quot;Hootenanny,&quot; Jack compares Joe&#x27;s Highland cottage to &quot;the but &#x27;n ben out of the bloody Broons&quot;, as a comical way to comment upon how shabby it appears.

==Annuals==
Although the Broons and Oor Wullie started in 1936, annuals were not published until 1939, starting with &quot;The Broons&quot;. since then the annuals alternate years with &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;, another D. C. Thomson product. Books pre-1965 were not dated. After that they had a copyright date with annuals normally published in Autumn. The early editions of &quot;The Broons&quot; annual are highly sought-after collectors&#x27; items, fetching in excess of four-figure sums at auction. A facsimile of the very first &quot;Broons&quot; annual was released on 25 November 2006.

Watkins drew the strip from his Broughty Ferry home until his death in 1969. For five years after Watkins&#x27; death, D. C. Thomson recycled old strips in the newspaper and annuals, fearing no adequate replacement could be found to match Watkins&#x27; unique style. In these repeated strips, some particularly Scots words were replaced (e.g., &#x27;ahint&#x27; became &#x27;behind&#x27;) and the pre-decimal coinage was updated. Mike Donaldson is the current artist, succeeding Peter Davidson. BBC Radio Scotland presenter Tom Morton was the scriptwriter until 2006 when Dave Donaldson took over. Morris Heggie, former editor of &quot;The Dandy&quot; is one of the current writers, however credits are now attributed when published in The Sunday Post.

==Television==
&quot;The Broons&quot; were portrayed in a sketch on the BBC Scotland comedy show &quot;Naked Video&quot;. Tony Roper was cast as Paw, Gregor Fisher played Maw, Elaine C. Smith portrayed the Bairn, Jonathan Watson appeared as Joe, and Louise Beattie appeared as Horace, with the other family members (and Oor Wullie) mentioned in passing. The sketch revolved around Paw&#x27;s naivety in the modern world and his inability to move with the times, not even realising that his entire offspring are the product of an affair Maw was having with a farmer.

In December 2005, the BBC Scotland documentary &quot;Happy Birthday Broons&quot; celebrated the family&#x27;s 70th anniversary with celebrity guests including Muriel Gray, Ford Kiernan, Sanjeev Kohli, Eddi Reader, Elaine C. Smith, Ricky Ross, Tony Roper, Tam Cowan, Grant Morrison, Frank Quitely and was narrated by Ewan McGregor. The programme was made by Angel Eye Media and was nominated for a Best Documentary BAFTA. It was followed by &quot;Happy Birthday Oor Wullie&quot;.

<text>On November 18, 1883, United States and Canadian railroads instituted standard time in time zones. Before then, time of day was a local matter, and most cities and towns used some form of local solar time, maintained by some well-known clock (for example, on a church steeple or in a jeweler&#x27;s window). The standard time system was not immediately embraced by all. Standard time in time zones was established in U.S. law in the Standard Time Act on March 19, 1918, at which time daylight saving time was also instituted.

Use of standard time gradually increased because of its obvious practical advantages for communication and travel. Standard time in time zones was established in U.S. law in the Standard Time Act on March 19, 1918. The act established daylight saving time, which was and is a contentious idea. Daylight saving time was repealed in 1919, but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter; ultimately, it was reinstated nationally early in World War II and was continuously observed until the end of the war. After the war its use varied among states and localities. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 provided standardization in the dates of beginning and end of daylight time in the U.S. but allowed for local exemptions from its observance. 

Time zone boundaries have changed greatly since their original introduction, and changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when these changes are made. Generally, time zone boundaries have tended to shift westward. Places on the eastern edge of a time zone can effectively move sunset an hour later (by the clock) by shifting to the time zone immediately to their east. If they do so, the boundary of that zone is locally shifted to the west; the accumulation of such changes results in the long distance term westward trend. The process is not inexorable, however, since the late sunrises experienced by such places during the winter may be regarded as too undesirable. Furthermore, under the law, the principal standard for deciding on a time zone change is the &quot;convenience of commerce&quot;. Proposed time zone changes have been both approved and rejected based on this criterion, although most such proposals have been accepted.

==Railway time==
One of the first reported incidents which brought about a change in how time was organized on railways in the United States occurred in New England in August 1853. Two trains heading towards each other on the same track collided in the Valley Falls train collision because the train conductors had different times set on their watches, resulting in the death of 14 passengers. Railway schedules were coordinated in New England shortly after this incident Numerous other collisions led to the setting up of the General Time Convention, a committee of railway companies to agree on scheduling.

In 1870 Charles F. Dowd, who was unconnected with the railway movement or civil authorities, proposed &quot;A System of National Times for Railroads&quot;, which involved a single time for railways but the keeping of local times for towns. Although this did not find favor with railway managers, in 1881 they agreed for the idea to be investigated by William Frederick Allen, who was the secretary of the General Time Convention and managing editor of the &quot;Travellers&#x27; Official Guide to the Railways&quot;. He proposed replacing the 50 different railway times with five time zones. He eventually persuaded the railway managers and the politicians running the cities that had several railway stations that it was in their interests to speedily adopt his simpler proposals, which aligned the zones with cities&#x27; railroad stations. In doing so, they would pre-empt the imposition of more costly and cumbersome arrangements by different state legislators and the naval authorities, both of whom favored retention of local times. 

On 11 October 1883, a convention of railroad executives met in Chicago at the General Time Convention (latter renamed the American Railway Association) and agreed to the implementation of five time zones in North America, using Greenwich Mean Time as a basis. Right to the end there was opposition expressed by many smaller towns and cities to the imposition of railway time. For example, in Indianapolis the report in the daily &quot;Sentinel&quot; for November 17, 1883, protested that people would have to &quot;eat sleep work ... and marry by railroad time&quot;. However, with the support of nearly all railway companies, most cities and influential observatories such as Yale and Harvard, this collaborative approach led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on November 18, 1883. This consensus held and was incorporated into federal law in 1918.

==Standard time and war time==

Daylight saving time (DST) was established by the Standard Time Act of 1918. The act was intended to save electricity for seven months of the year, during World War I. DST was repealed in 1919 over a presidential veto, but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter.
During World War II, Congress enacted the War Time Act (56 Stat. 9) on January 20, 1942. Year-round DST was reinstated in the United States on February 9, 1942, again as a wartime measure to conserve energy resources. This remained in effect until after the end of the war. After V-J Day, the word &#x27;war&#x27; and the middle letter &#x27;W&#x27; were changed to &#x27;prevailing&#x27; and &#x27;P&#x27;, but the advance in the clock was not reverted. The Amendment to the War Time Act (59 Stat. 537) ended DST as of September 30, 1945. During this period, the official designation War Time was used for year-round DST. For example, Eastern War Time (EWT) would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time during this period.

==Local-option daylight saving time==

From 1945 to 1966 U.S. federal law did not address DST. States and cities were free to observe DST or not, and most places that did observe DST did so from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September. In the mid-1950s many areas in the northeastern United States began extending DST to the last Sunday in October. The lack of standardization led to a patchwork where some areas observed DST while adjacent areas did not, and it was not unheard of to have to reset a clock several times during a short trip (e.g., bus drivers operating on West Virginia Route 2 between Moundsville, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, had to reset their watches seven times over 35 miles).

In summer 1960 April–October Daylight Time was nearly universal in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and states east and north of there. In Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia and states north and east of there, some areas used DST and some did not. Except for California and Nevada, which had April–September Daylight Time, 99% of the rest of the country used Standard Time year-round. (The Official Guide says &quot;State law prohibits the observance of &quot;Daylight Saving&quot; time in Kentucky but Anchorage, Louisville and Shelbyville will advance their clocks one hour from Central Standard time for the period April 24 to October 29, inclusive.&quot;)

==Uniform Time Act==
In the mid-1960s the airline and other transportation industries lobbied for uniformity of DST dates in the United States. The federal Uniform Time Act became law on April 13, 1966, and it mandated that DST begin nationwide on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October, effective in 1967. The act explicitly preempted all previously enacted state laws related to the beginning and ending of DST effective in 1966. Any state that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law, provided that it exempted the entire state, and Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, and Michigan chose to do so. However, Alaska, Indiana, and Michigan subsequently chose to observe DST.

The act also continued the authority of the ICC over time zone boundaries. In subsequent years, the United States Congress transferred the authority over time zones to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). 

The law was amended in 1972 to permit states that straddle a time zone boundary to exempt the entire area of the state lying in one time zone. Indiana chose to exempt the portion of the state lying in the Eastern Time Zone; however, that exemption was eliminated in 2006, and the entire state of Indiana now observes DST, leaving Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii as the only two states not to observe DST. 

In response to the 1973 oil crisis, DST began earlier in both 1974 and 1975, commencing on the first Sunday in January (January 6) in the former year and the last Sunday in February (February 23) in the latter. The extension was not continued due to public opposition to late sunrise times during the winter months. In 1976, the United States reverted to the schedule set in the Uniform Time Act.

==Daylight saving time extensions==

On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law that contained a daylight saving rider authored by Senator Slade Gorton. The start date of DST was amended from the last Sunday of April to the first Sunday in April effective in 1987, extending DST three to four weeks; DST continued to end on the last Sunday in October. While the states retain the capability to exempt themselves from DST, they are forbidden by the 1966 federal law (15 USC 260a(b)) from increasing a state&#x27;s time spent on DST, unless the United States Congress does this for the entire nation.

Starting March 11, 2007, DST was extended another four to five weeks, by moving both its start date to the second Sunday of March and its end date to the first Sunday of November. This time the change was introduced by Representatives Fred Upton and Ed Markey and added to the Energy Policy Act of 2005; the United States House of Representatives had originally approved a motion that would have extended DST even farther from the first Sunday in March to the last Sunday in November, but Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici agreed to scale back the proposal in conference committee due to complaints from farmers and the airline industry. Proponents claimed that the extension would save &quot;the equivalent of&quot; of oil per day, but this figure was based on outdated United States Department of Energy information from the 1970s; later studies by the U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission have predicted much smaller energy benefits. There is very little recent research on what the actual positive effects, if any, might be.

=== Controversy ===
Since DST moves sunrise one hour later by the clock, late sunrise times become a problem when DST is observed either too far before the March equinox or too far after the September equinox. Because of this, the extension was greeted with criticism by those concerned for the safety of children who would have been forced to travel to school before sunrise, especially in the month of March. In addition, the airline industry was especially concerned if DST were to be extended through to the last Sunday in November, as this is very often the Sunday after Thanksgiving (except for 2013, 2019, 2024, and 2030), as this is always the Sunday after the fourth Friday in November, and Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday in November. This is one of the busiest travel days at American airports, and could have resulted in much havoc among travelers who forgot that the clocks were changing that day.

If the original proposal to extend DST through the last Sunday in November had been adopted, the entire United States, with the exception of the states that exempted themselves, would have experienced the latest sunrises of the year during the month of November, which would have approached the extremely late sunrise times when DST went into effect on January 6, 1974, due to the 1973 energy crisis creeping after 9 am in places like New Salem, North Dakota at the northwestern edges of time zones.

Under the current rules, the latest sunrise occurs on the day before DST ends, everywhere in the United States that observes DST. This sunrise time is later than any during the winter months.

<doc id="480685" wikidata="Q594646" url="?curid=480685" title="Paillier cryptosystem">
<text>The Paillier cryptosystem, invented by and named after Pascal Paillier in 1999, is a probabilistic asymmetric algorithm for public key cryptography. The problem of computing &quot;n&quot;-th residue classes is believed to be computationally difficult. The decisional composite residuosity assumption is the intractability hypothesis upon which this cryptosystem is based.

The scheme is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem; this means that, given only the public key and the
encryption of formula_1 and formula_2, one can compute the encryption of formula_3.

==Algorithm==
The scheme works as follows:

=== Key generation ===
#Choose two large prime numbers formula_4 and formula_5 randomly and independently of each other such that formula_6. This property is assured if both primes are of equal length.
#Compute formula_7 and formula_8. lcm means Least Common Multiple. 
#Select random integer formula_9 where formula_10
#Ensure formula_11 divides the order of formula_9 by checking the existence of the following modular multiplicative inverse: formula_13,
:where function formula_14 is defined as formula_15 .
::Note that the notation formula_16 does not denote the modular multiplication of formula_17 times the modular multiplicative inverse of formula_18 but rather the quotient of formula_17 divided by formula_18, i.e., the largest integer value formula_21 to satisfy the relation formula_22.

*The public (encryption) key is formula_23.
*The private (decryption) key is formula_24
If using p,q of equivalent length, a simpler variant of the above key generation steps would be to set formula_25 and formula_26, where formula_27 .
The simpler variant is recommended for implementational purposes, because in the general form the calculation time of formula_28 can be very high with sufficiently large primes p,q.

=== Encryption ===
#Let formula_29 be a message to be encrypted where formula_30
#Select random formula_31 where formula_32 and formula_33. &lt;br&gt; (Note: if you find a value that has formula_34, you can use this to calculate the private key: this is unlikely enough to ignore.)
#Compute ciphertext as: formula_35

=== Decryption ===
#Let formula_36 be the ciphertext to decrypt, where formula_37
#Compute the plaintext message as: formula_38

As the original paper points out, decryption is &quot;essentially one exponentiation modulo formula_39.&quot;

=== Homomorphic properties ===
A notable feature of the Paillier cryptosystem is its homomorphic properties along with its non-deterministic encryption (see Electronic voting in Applications for usage). As the encryption function is additively homomorphic, the following identities can be described:

* Homomorphic addition of plaintexts

: The product of two ciphertexts will decrypt to the sum of their corresponding plaintexts,

:: formula_40

: The product of a ciphertext with a plaintext raising formula_9 will decrypt to the sum of the corresponding plaintexts,

:: formula_42

* Homomorphic multiplication of plaintexts

: A ciphertext raised to the power of a plaintext will decrypt to the product of the two plaintexts,

:: formula_43
:: formula_44

: More generally, a ciphertext raised to a constant &quot;k&quot; will decrypt to the product of the plaintext and the constant,

:: formula_45

However, given the Paillier encryptions of two messages there is no known way to compute an encryption of the product of these messages without knowing the private key.

===Background===
Paillier cryptosystem exploits the fact that certain discrete logarithms can be computed easily.

For example, by binomial theorem,
:: formula_46

This indicates that:
:: formula_47
Therefore, if:
:: formula_48
then
:: formula_49.
Thus:
:: formula_50,
:where function formula_14 is defined as formula_52 (quotient of integer division) and formula_53.

===Semantic security===
The original cryptosystem as shown above does provide semantic security against chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA). The ability to successfully distinguish the challenge ciphertext essentially amounts to the ability to decide composite residuosity. The so-called decisional composite residuosity assumption (DCRA) is believed to be intractable.

Because of the aforementioned homomorphic properties however, the system is malleable, and therefore does not enjoy the highest level of semantic security, protection against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2). 
Usually in cryptography the notion of malleability is not seen as an &quot;advantage,&quot; but under certain applications such as secure electronic voting and threshold cryptosystems, this property may indeed be necessary.

Paillier and Pointcheval however went on to propose an improved cryptosystem that incorporates the combined hashing of message &quot;m&quot; with random &quot;r&quot;. Similar in intent to the Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem, the hashing prevents an attacker, given only &quot;c,&quot; from being able to change &quot;m&quot; in a meaningful way. Through this adaptation the improved scheme can be shown to be IND-CCA2 secure in the random oracle model.

===Applications===

Semantic security is not the only consideration. There are situations under which malleability may be desirable. Secure electronic voting systems can utilize the above homomorphic properties. Consider a simple binary (&quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot;) vote. Let &quot;m&quot; voters cast a vote of either &quot;1&quot; (for) or &quot;0&quot; (against). Each voter encrypts their choice before casting their vote. The election official takes the product of the &quot;m&quot; encrypted votes and then decrypts the result and obtains the value &quot;n&quot;, which is the sum of all the votes. The election official then knows that &quot;n&quot; people voted &quot;for&quot; and &quot;m-n&quot; people voted &quot;against&quot;. The role of the random &quot;r&quot; ensures that two equivalent votes will encrypt to the same value only with negligible likelihood, hence ensuring voter privacy.

====Electronic cash====
Another feature named in paper is the notion of self-blinding. This is the ability to change one ciphertext into another without changing the content of its decryption. This has application to the development of ecash, an effort originally spearheaded by David Chaum. Imagine paying for an item online without the vendor needing to know your credit card number, and hence your identity. The goal in both electronic cash and electronic voting, is to ensure the e-coin (likewise e-vote) is valid, while at the same time not disclosing the identity of the person with whom it is currently associated.

====Electronic auction====
The Paillier cryptosystem plays a crucial role in enhancing the security of electronic auctions. It prevents fraudulent activities such as dishonest auctioneers and collusion between bidders and auctioneers who manipulate bids. By ensuring the confidentiality of actual bidding values while revealing auction results, the Pailler cryptosystem successfully promotes fair practices. 

====Threshold cryptosystem====
The homomorphic property of Paillier cryptosystem is sometimes used to build Threshold ECDSA signature.

<doc id="480696" wikidata="Q7767384" url="?curid=480696" title="The Sunday Post">
<text>The Sunday Post is a weekly newspaper published in Dundee, Scotland, by DC Thomson, and characterised by a mix of news, human interest stories and short features. The paper was founded in 1914 and has a wide circulation across Scotland, Ulster (chiefly across Northern Ireland and County Donegal), and parts of Northern England.

The current editor is Dave Lord.

Sales of &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; in Scotland were once so high that it was recorded in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the newspaper with the highest per capita readership penetration of anywhere in the world; in 1969, its total estimated readership of 2,931,000 represented more than 80 per cent of the entire population of Scotland aged 16 and over. &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; has seen a decline in circulation in common with other print titles; in 1999, circulation was around 700,000, dropping to just under 143,000 in December 2016, with a year-on-year fall of 13.5% recorded for 2016.

2007 saw DC Thomson launch an advertising drive for &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;, primarily used on buses, in which the exclamation &quot;Strip Sensation!&quot; is seen by a picture of the folded paper displaying its masthead; next to this is the tagline punning on the exclamation: &quot;A thoroughly decent read&quot;.

The newspaper backed a &quot;No&quot; vote in the referendum on Scottish independence.

In 2014, a weekly magazine supplement was reintroduced. Called &quot;IN10&quot;, it features entertainment, food, homes, gardens, travel and books as well as &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;&#x27;s man in Hollywood, Ross King.

==Regular features==
Regular columns include:
*&quot;My Week&quot; by Francis Gay (a generic character), featuring sentimental stories and a weekly short poem
*&quot;The Honest Truth&quot; – question and answer celebrity interview feature
*&quot;Raw Deal&quot; – consumer problems
*&quot;The Doc Replies&quot; – medical advice
*&quot;Can You Do Me a Favour?&quot; – readers asking if fellow readers can help them in their quest to find an item (discontinued)
*&quot;The Queries Man&quot; – readers send in questions on a range of topics, which an unnamed person answers
*&quot;Your Money&quot; – Personal finance feature.
*&quot;On The Box&quot; – TV review column.

<doc id="480700" wikidata="Q669391" url="?curid=480700" title="Biosensor">
<text>A biosensor is an analytical device, used for the detection of a chemical substance, that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector. 
The &quot;sensitive biological element&quot;, e.g. tissue, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc., is a biologically derived material or biomimetic component that interacts with, binds with, or recognizes the analyte under study. The biologically sensitive elements can also be created by biological engineering.
The &quot;transducer&quot; or the &quot;detector element&quot;, which transforms one signal into another one, works in a physicochemical way: optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical,
electrochemiluminescence etc., resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element, to easily measure and quantify.
The biosensor reader device connects with the associated electronics or signal processors that are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-friendly way. This sometimes accounts for the most expensive part of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user friendly display that includes transducer and sensitive element (holographic sensor). The readers are usually custom-designed and manufactured to suit the different working principles of biosensors.

==Biosensor system==

A biosensor typically consists of a bio-receptor (enzyme/antibody/cell/nucleic acid/aptamer), transducer component (semi-conducting material/nanomaterial), and electronic system which includes a signal amplifier, processor &amp; display. Transducers and electronics can be combined, e.g., in CMOS-based microsensor systems. The recognition component, often called a bioreceptor, uses biomolecules from organisms or receptors modeled after biological systems to interact with the analyte of interest. This interaction is measured by the biotransducer which outputs a measurable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample. The general aim of the design of a biosensor is to enable quick, convenient testing at the point of concern or care where the sample was procured.

==Bioreceptors==
In a biosensor, the bioreceptor is designed to interact with the specific analyte of interest to produce an effect measurable by the transducer. High selectivity for the analyte among a matrix of other chemical or biological components is a key requirement of the bioreceptor. While the type of biomolecule used can vary widely, biosensors can be classified according to common types of bioreceptor interactions involving: antibody/antigen, enzymes/ligands, nucleic acids/DNA, cellular structures/cells, or biomimetic materials.

===Antibody/antigen interactions===
An immunosensor utilizes the very specific binding affinity of antibodies for a specific compound or antigen. The specific nature of the antibody-antigen interaction is analogous to a lock and key fit in that the antigen will only bind to the antibody if it has the correct conformation. Binding events result in a physicochemical change that in combination with a tracer, such as fluorescent molecules, enzymes, or radioisotopes, can generate a signal. There are limitations with using antibodies in sensors: 1. The antibody binding capacity is strongly dependent on assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature), and 2. the antibody-antigen interaction is generally robust, however, binding can be disrupted by chaotropic reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation.

Antibody-antigen interactions can also be used for serological testing, or the detection of circulating antibodies in response to a specific disease. Importantly, serology tests have become an important part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Artificial binding proteins===
The use of antibodies as the bio-recognition component of biosensors has several drawbacks. They have high molecular weights and limited stability, contain essential disulfide bonds and are expensive to produce. In one approach to overcome these limitations, recombinant binding fragments (Fab, Fv or scFv) or domains (VH, VHH) of antibodies have been engineered. In another approach, small protein scaffolds with favorable biophysical properties have been engineered to generate artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP), capable of specific binding to different target proteins while retaining the favorable properties of the parent molecule. The elements of the family that specifically bind to a given target antigen, are often selected in vitro by display techniques: phage display, ribosome display, yeast display or mRNA display. The artificial binding proteins are much smaller than antibodies (usually less than 100 amino-acid residues), have a strong stability, lack disulfide bonds and can be expressed in high yield in reducing cellular environments like the bacterial cytoplasm, contrary to antibodies and their derivatives. They are thus especially suitable to create biosensors.

===Enzymatic interactions===
The specific binding capabilities and catalytic activity of enzymes make them popular bioreceptors. Analyte recognition is enabled through several possible mechanisms: 1) the enzyme converting the analyte into a product that is sensor-detectable, 2) detecting enzyme inhibition or activation by the analyte, or 3) monitoring modification of enzyme properties resulting from interaction with the analyte. The main reasons for the common use of enzymes in biosensors are: 1) ability to catalyze a large number of reactions; 2) potential to detect a group of analytes (substrates, products, inhibitors, and modulators of the catalytic activity); and 3) suitability with several different transduction methods for detecting the analyte. Notably, since enzymes are not consumed in reactions, the biosensor can easily be used continuously. The catalytic activity of enzymes also allows lower limits of detection compared to common binding techniques. However, the sensor&#x27;s lifetime is limited by the stability of the enzyme.

===Affinity binding receptors===
Antibodies have a high binding constant in excess of 10^8 L/mol, which stands for a nearly irreversible association once the antigen-antibody couple has formed. For certain analyte molecules like glucose affinity binding proteins exist that bind their ligand with a high specificity like an antibody, but with a much smaller binding constant on the order of 10^2 to 10^4 L/mol. The association between analyte and receptor then is of reversible nature and next to the couple between both also their free molecules occur in a measurable concentration. In case of glucose, for instance, concanavalin A may function as affinity receptor exhibiting a binding constant of 4x10^2 L/mol. The use of affinity binding receptors for purposes of biosensing has been proposed by Schultz and Sims in 1979 and was subsequently configured into a fluorescent assay for measuring glucose in the relevant physiological range between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/L. The sensor principle has the advantage that it does not consume the analyte in a chemical reaction as occurs in enzymatic assays.

===Nucleic acid interactions===
Biosensors employing nucleic acid based receptors can be either based on complementary base pairing interactions referred to as genosensors or specific nucleic acid based antibody mimics (aptamers) as aptasensors. In the former, the recognition process is based on the principle of complementary base pairing, adenine:thymine and cytosine:guanine in DNA. If the target nucleic acid sequence is known, complementary sequences can be synthesized, labeled, and then immobilized on the sensor. The hybridization event can be optically detected and presence of target DNA/RNA ascertained. In the latter, aptamers generated against the target recognise it via interplay of specific non-covalent interactions and induced fitting. These aptamers can be labelled with a fluorophore/metal nanoparticles easily for optical detection or may be employed for label-free electrochemical or cantilever based detection platforms for a wide range of target molecules or complex targets like cells and viruses. Additionally, aptamers can be combined with nucleic acid enzymes, such as RNA-cleaving DNAzymes, providing both target recognition and signal generation in a single molecule, which shows potential applications in the development of multiplex biosensors.

===Epigenetics===
It has been proposed that properly optimized integrated optical resonators can be exploited for detecting epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications) in body fluids from patients affected by cancer or other diseases. Photonic biosensors with ultra-sensitivity are nowadays being developed at a research level to easily detect cancerous cells within the patient&#x27;s urine. Different research projects aim to develop new portable devices that use cheap, environmentally friendly, disposable cartridges that require only simple handling with no need of further processing, washing, or manipulation by expert technicians.

===Organelles===
Organelles form separate compartments inside cells and usually perform functions independently. Different kinds of organelles have various metabolic pathways and contain enzymes to fulfill its function. Commonly used organelles include lysosome, chloroplast and mitochondria. The spatial-temporal distribution pattern of calcium is closely related to ubiquitous signaling pathway. Mitochondria actively participate in the metabolism of calcium ions to control the function and also modulate the calcium related signaling pathways. Experiments have proved that mitochondria have the ability to respond to high calcium concentrations generated in their proximity by opening the calcium channels. In this way, mitochondria can be used to detect the calcium concentration in medium and the detection is very sensitive due to high spatial resolution. Another application of mitochondria is used for detection of water pollution. Detergent compounds&#x27; toxicity will damage the cell and subcellular structure including mitochondria. The detergents will cause a swelling effect which could be measured by an absorbance change. Experiment data shows the change rate is proportional to the detergent concentration, providing a high standard for detection accuracy.

===Cells===
Cells are often used in bioreceptors because they are sensitive to surrounding environment and they can respond to all kinds of stimulants. Cells tend to attach to the surface so they can be easily immobilized. Compared to organelles they remain active for longer period and the reproducibility makes them reusable. They are commonly used to detect global parameter like stress condition, toxicity and organic derivatives. They can also be used to monitor the treatment effect of drugs. One application is to use cells to determine herbicides which are main aquatic contaminant. Microalgae are entrapped on a quartz microfiber and the chlorophyll fluorescence modified by herbicides is collected at the tip of an optical fiber bundle and transmitted to a fluorimeter. The algae are continuously cultured to get optimized measurement. Results show that detection limit of certain herbicide can reach sub-ppb concentration level. Some cells can also be used to monitor the microbial corrosion. Pseudomonas sp. is isolated from corroded material surface and immobilized on acetylcellulose membrane. The respiration activity is determined by measuring oxygen consumption. There is linear relationship between the current generated and the concentration of sulfuric acid. The response time is related to the loading of cells and surrounding environments and can be controlled to no more than 5min.

===Tissue===
Tissues are used for biosensor for the abundance of enzymes existing. Advantages of tissues as biosensors include the following:

* easier to immobilize compared to cells and organelles
* the higher activity and stability from maintaining enzymes in the natural environment
* the availability and low price
* the avoidance of tedious work of extraction, centrifuge, and purification of enzymes
* necessary cofactors for an enzyme to function exists
* the diversity providing a wide range of choices concerning different objectives.

There also exist some disadvantages of tissues, like the lack of specificity due to the interference of other enzymes and longer response time due to the transport barrier.

===Microbial biosensors===
Microbial biosensors exploit the response of bacteria to a given substance. For example, arsenic can be detected using the ars operon found in several bacterial taxon.

==Surface attachment of the biological elements==
An important part of a biosensor is to attach the biological elements (small molecules/protein/cells) to the surface of the sensor (be it metal, polymer, or glass). The simplest way is to functionalize the surface in order to coat it with the biological elements. This can be done by polylysine, aminosilane, epoxysilane, or nitrocellulose in the case of silicon chips/silica glass. Subsequently, the bound biological agent may also be fixed—for example, by layer by layer deposition of alternatively charged polymer coatings.

Alternatively, three-dimensional lattices (hydrogel/xerogel) can be used to chemically or physically entrap these (whereby chemically entrapped it is meant that the biological element is kept in place by a strong bond, while physically they are kept in place being unable to pass through the pores of the gel matrix). The most commonly used hydrogel is sol-gel, glassy silica generated by polymerization of silicate monomers (added as tetra alkyl orthosilicates, such as TMOS or TEOS) in the presence of the biological elements (along with other stabilizing polymers, such as PEG) in the case of physical entrapment.

Another group of hydrogels, which set under conditions suitable for cells or protein, are acrylate hydrogel, which polymerizes upon radical initiation. One type of radical initiator is a peroxide radical, typically generated by combining a persulfate with TEMED (Polyacrylamide gel are also commonly used for protein electrophoresis), alternatively light can be used in combination with a photoinitiator, such as DMPA (2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone). Smart materials that mimic the biological components of a sensor can also be classified as biosensors using only the active or catalytic site or analogous configurations of a biomolecule.

==Biotransducer==
Biosensors can be classified by their biotransducer type. The most common types of biotransducers used in biosensors are:

* electrochemical biosensors
* optical biosensors
* electronic biosensors
* piezoelectric biosensors
* gravimetric biosensors
* pyroelectric biosensors
* magnetic biosensors

===Electrochemical===
Electrochemical biosensors, based on enzymes, work through the enzymatic catalysis of reactions that directly or indirectly produce or consume electrons (such enzymes are rightly called redox enzymes). The sensor design usually consists of three electrodes; a reference electrode, a working electrode, and a counter electrode. The target analyte is involved in the reaction that takes place on the surface of the active working electrode, and the reaction may cause either electron transfer across the double layer (producing a current) or can contribute to the double layer potential (producing a voltage). The current (rate of flow of electrons is now proportional to the analyte concentration) can be measured at a fixed potential or the potential can be measured at zero current (this gives a logarithmic response). Note that potential of the working electrode is space charge sensitive and this is often used. Additionally, the label-free and direct electrical detection of small peptides and proteins is possible by their intrinsic charges using biofunctionalized ion-sensitive field-effect transistors.

Another example, the potentiometric biosensor, (potential produced at zero current) gives a logarithmic response with a high dynamic range. Such biosensors are often made by screen printing the electrode patterns on a plastic substrate, coated with a conducting polymer and then some protein (enzyme or antibody) is attached. They have only two electrodes and are extremely sensitive and robust. They enable the detection of analytes at levels previously only achievable by HPLC and LC/MS and without rigorous sample preparation. All biosensors usually involve minimal sample preparation as the biological sensing component is highly selective for the analyte concerned. The signal is produced by electrochemical and physical changes in the conducting polymer layer due to changes occurring at the surface of the sensor. Such changes can be attributed to ionic strength, pH, hydration and redox reactions, the latter due to the enzyme label turning over a substrate. Field effect transistors, in which the gate region has been modified with an enzyme or antibody, can also detect very low concentrations of various analytes as the binding of the analyte to the gate region of the FET cause a change in the drain-source current.

Impedance spectroscopy based biosensor development has been gaining traction nowadays and many such devices / developments are found in the academia and industry. One such device, based on a 4-electrode electrochemical cell, using a nanoporous alumina membrane, has been shown to detect low concentrations of human alpha thrombin in presence of high background of serum albumin. Also interdigitated electrodes have been used for impedance biosensors.

===Ion channel switch===

The use of ion channels has been shown to offer highly sensitive detection 
of target biological molecules. By embedding the ion channels in supported or tethered bilayer membranes (t-BLM) attached to a gold electrode, an electrical circuit is created. Capture molecules such as antibodies can be bound to the ion channel so that the binding of the target molecule controls the ion flow through the channel. This results in a measurable change in the electrical conduction which is proportional to the concentration of the target.

An ion channel switch (ICS) biosensor can be created using gramicidin, a dimeric peptide channel, in a tethered bilayer membrane. One peptide of gramicidin, with attached antibody, is mobile and one is fixed. Breaking the dimer stops the ionic current through the membrane. The magnitude of the change in electrical signal is greatly increased by separating the membrane from the metal surface using a hydrophilic spacer.

Quantitative detection of an extensive class of target species, including proteins, bacteria, drug and toxins has been demonstrated using different membrane and capture configurations. The European research project Greensense develops a biosensor to perform quantitative screening of drug-of-abuse such as THC, morphine, and cocaine in saliva and urine.

===Reagentless fluorescent biosensor===
A reagentless biosensor can monitor a target analyte in a complex biological mixture without additional reagent. Therefore, it can function continuously if immobilized on a solid support. A fluorescent biosensor reacts to the interaction with its target analyte by a change of its fluorescence properties. A Reagentless Fluorescent biosensor (RF biosensor) can be obtained by integrating a biological receptor, which is directed against the target analyte, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, whose emission properties are sensitive to the nature of its local environment, in a single macromolecule. The fluorophore transduces the recognition event into a measurable optical signal. The use of extrinsic fluorophores, whose emission properties differ widely from those of the intrinsic fluorophores of proteins, tryptophan and tyrosine, enables one to immediately detect and quantify the analyte in complex biological mixtures. The integration of the fluorophore must be done in a site where it is sensitive to the binding of the analyte without perturbing the affinity of the receptor.

Antibodies and artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP) are well suited to provide the recognition module of RF biosensors since they can be directed against any antigen (see the paragraph on bioreceptors). A general approach to integrate a solvatochromic fluorophore in an AgBP when the atomic structure of the complex with its antigen is known, and thus transform it into a RF biosensor, has been described. A residue of the AgBP is identified in the neighborhood of the antigen in their complex. This residue is changed into a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. The fluorophore is chemically coupled to the mutant cysteine. When the design is successful, the coupled fluorophore does not prevent the binding of the antigen, this binding shields the fluorophore from the solvent, and it can be detected by a change of fluorescence. This strategy is also valid for antibody fragments.

However, in the absence of specific structural data, other strategies must be applied. Antibodies and artificial families of AgBPs are constituted by a set of hypervariable (or randomized) residue positions, located in a unique sub-region of the protein, and supported by a constant polypeptide scaffold. The residues that form the binding site for a given antigen, are selected among the hypervariable residues. It is possible to transform any AgBP of these families into a RF biosensor, specific of the target antigen, simply by coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore to one of the hypervariable residues that have little or no importance for the interaction with the antigen, after changing this residue into cysteine by mutagenesis. More specifically, the strategy consists in individually changing the residues of the hypervariable positions into cysteine at the genetic level, in chemically coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore with the mutant cysteine, and then in keeping the resulting conjugates that have the highest sensitivity (a parameter that involves both affinity and variation of fluorescence signal). This approach is also valid for families of antibody fragments.

A posteriori studies have shown that the best reagentless fluorescent biosensors are obtained when the fluorophore does not make non-covalent interactions with the surface of the bioreceptor, which would increase the background signal, and when it interacts with a binding pocket at the surface of the target antigen. The RF biosensors that are obtained by the above methods, can function and detect target analytes inside living cells.

=== Magnetic biosensors ===
Magnetic biosensors utilize paramagnetic or supra-paramagnetic particles, or crystals, to detect biological interactions. Examples could be coil-inductance, resistance, or other magnetic properties. It is common to use magnetic nano or microparticles. In the surface of such particles are the bioreceptors, that can be DNA (complementary to a sequence or aptamers) antibodies, or others. The binding of the bioreceptor will affect some of the magnetic particle properties that can be measured by AC susceptometry, a Hall Effect sensor, a giant magnetoresistance device, or others.

===Others===
Piezoelectric sensors utilise crystals which undergo an elastic deformation when an electrical potential is applied to them. An alternating potential (A.C.) produces a standing wave in the crystal at a characteristic frequency. This frequency is highly dependent on the elastic properties of the crystal, such that if a crystal is coated with a biological recognition element the binding of a (large) target analyte to a receptor will produce a change in the resonance frequency, which gives a binding signal. In a mode that uses surface acoustic waves (SAW), the sensitivity is greatly increased. This is a specialised application of the quartz crystal microbalance as a biosensor

Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is nowadays a leading technique in biosensors. Since the excited species are produced with an electrochemical stimulus rather than with a light excitation source, ECL displays improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to photoluminescence, with minimized effects due to light scattering and luminescence background. In particular, coreactant ECL operating in buffered aqueous solution in the region of positive potentials (oxidative-reduction mechanism) definitively boosted ECL for immunoassay, as confirmed by many research applications and, even more, by the presence of important companies which developed commercial hardware for high throughput immunoassays analysis in a market worth billions of dollars each year.

Thermometric biosensors are rare.

==Biosensor MOSFET (BioFET)==
The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, Later, Leland C. Clark and Champ Lyons invented the first biosensor in 1962. Biosensor MOSFETs (BioFETs) were later developed, and they have since been widely used to measure physical, chemical, biological and environmental parameters.

The first BioFET was the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), invented by Piet Bergveld for electrochemical and biological applications in 1970. the adsorption FET (ADFET) was patented by P.F. Cox in 1974, and a hydrogen-sensitive MOSFET was demonstrated by I. Lundstrom, M.S. Shivaraman, C.S. Svenson and L. Lundkvist in 1975. The ISFET is a special type of MOSFET with a gate at a certain distance, and where the metal gate is replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. The ISFET is widely used in biomedical applications, such as the detection of DNA hybridization, biomarker detection from blood, antibody detection, glucose measurement, pH sensing, and genetic technology.

By the mid-1980s, other BioFETs had been developed, including the gas sensor FET (GASFET), pressure sensor FET (PRESSFET), chemical field-effect transistor (ChemFET), reference ISFET (REFET), enzyme-modified FET (ENFET) and immunologically modified FET (IMFET). By the early 2000s, BioFETs such as the DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET), gene-modified FET (GenFET) and cell-potential BioFET (CPFET) had been developed.

==Placement of biosensors==
The appropriate placement of biosensors depends on their field of application, which may roughly be divided into biotechnology, agriculture, food technology and biomedicine.

In biotechnology, analysis of the chemical composition of cultivation broth can be conducted in-line, on-line, at-line and off-line. As outlined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the sample is not removed from the process stream for in-line sensors, while it is diverted from the manufacturing process for on-line measurements. For at-line sensors the sample may be removed and analyzed in close proximity to the process stream. An example of the latter is the monitoring of lactose in a dairy processing plant. Off-line biosensors compare to bioanalytical techniques that are not operating in the field, but in the laboratory. These techniques are mainly used in agriculture, food technology and biomedicine.

In medical applications biosensors are generally categorized as &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; systems. An &quot;in vitro&quot;, biosensor measurement takes place in a test tube, a culture dish, a microtiter plate or elsewhere outside a living organism. The sensor uses a bioreceptor and transducer as outlined above. An example of an &quot;in vitro&quot; biosensor is an enzyme-conductimetric biosensor for blood glucose monitoring. There is a challenge to create a biosensor that operates by the principle of point-of-care testing, i.e. at the location where the test is needed. Development of wearable biosensors is among such studies. The elimination of lab testing can save time and money. An application of a POCT biosensor can be for the testing of HIV in areas where it is difficult for patients to be tested. A biosensor can be sent directly to the location and a quick and easy test can be used. 
An &quot;in vivo&quot; biosensor is an implantable device that operates inside the body. Of course, biosensor implants have to fulfill the strict regulations on sterilization in order to avoid an initial inflammatory response after implantation. The second concern relates to the long-term biocompatibility, i.e. the unharmful interaction with the body environment during the intended period of use. Another issue that arises is failure. If there is failure, the device must be removed and replaced, causing additional surgery. An example for application of an in vivo biosensor would be the insulin monitoring within the body, which is not available yet.

Most advanced biosensor implants have been developed for the continuous monitoring of glucose. The figure displays a device, for which a Ti casing and a battery as established for cardiovascular implants like pacemakers and defibrillators is used. Its size is determined by the battery as required for a lifetime of one year. Measured glucose data will be transmitted wirelessly out of the body within the MICS 402-405 MHz band as approved for medical implants.

Biosensors can also be integrated into mobile phone systems, making them user-friendly and accessible to a large number of users.

==Applications==
There are many potential applications of biosensors of various types. The main requirements for a biosensor approach to be valuable in terms of research and commercial applications are the identification of a target molecule, availability of a suitable biological recognition element, and the potential for disposable portable detection systems to be preferred to sensitive laboratory-based techniques in some situations. Some examples are:

* glucose monitoring in diabetes patients, other medical health related targets, 
* environmental applications, e.g. the detection of pesticides, detection and determining of organophosphate, and river water contaminants, such as heavy metal ions, 
* remote sensing of airborne bacteria, e.g. in counter-bioterrorist activities, 
* remote sensing of water quality in coastal waters by describing online different aspects of clam ethology (biological rhythms, growth rates, spawning or death records) in groups of abandoned bivalves around the world, 
* detection of pathogens, 
* determining levels of toxic substances before and after bioremediation, 
* routine analytical measurement of folic acid, biotin, vitamin B12 and pantothenic acid as an alternative to microbiological assay, 
* determination of drug residues in food, such as antibiotics and growth promoters, particularly meat and honey, 
* drug discovery and evaluation of biological activity of new compounds, 
* protein engineering in biosensors, and 
* detection of toxic metabolites such as mycotoxins.

A common example of a commercial biosensor is the blood glucose biosensor, which uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so it first oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of the enzyme) to FADH2. This in turn is oxidized by the electrode in a number of steps. The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.

A canary in a cage, as used by miners to warn of gas, could be considered a biosensor. Many of today&#x27;s biosensor applications are similar, in that they use organisms which respond to toxic substances at a much lower concentrations than humans can detect to warn of their presence. Such devices can be used in environmental monitoring, trace gas detection and in water treatment facilities.

===Glucose monitoring===

Commercially available glucose monitors rely on amperometric sensing of glucose by means of glucose oxidase, which oxidises glucose producing hydrogen peroxide which is detected by the electrode. To overcome the limitation of amperometric sensors, a flurry of research is present into novel sensing methods, such as fluorescent glucose biosensors.

===Interferometric reflectance imaging sensor===
The interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS) is based on the principles of optical interference and consists of a silicon-silicon oxide substrate, standard optics, and low-powered coherent LEDs. When light is illuminated through a low magnification objective onto the layered silicon-silicon oxide substrate, an interferometric signature is produced. As biomass, which has a similar index of refraction as silicon oxide, accumulates on the substrate surface, a change in the interferometric signature occurs and the change can be correlated to a quantifiable mass. &quot;Daaboul et al.&quot; used IRIS to yield a label-free sensitivity of approximately 19 ng/mL. &quot;Ahn et al.&quot; improved the sensitivity of IRIS through a mass tagging technique.

Since initial publication, IRIS has been adapted to perform various functions. First, IRIS integrated a fluorescence imaging capability into the interferometric imaging instrument as a potential way to address fluorescence protein microarray variability. Briefly, the variation in fluorescence microarrays mainly derives from inconsistent protein immobilization on surfaces and may cause misdiagnoses in allergy microarrays. To correct for any variation in protein immobilization, data acquired in the fluorescence modality is then normalized by the data acquired in the label-free modality. IRIS has also been adapted to perform single nanoparticle counting by simply switching the low magnification objective used for label-free biomass quantification to a higher objective magnification. This modality enables size discrimination in complex human biological samples. &quot;Monroe et al.&quot; used IRIS to quantify protein levels spiked into human whole blood and serum and determined allergen sensitization in characterized human blood samples using zero sample processing. Other practical uses of this device include virus and pathogen detection.

===Food analysis===
There are several applications of biosensors in food analysis. In the food industry, optics coated with antibodies are commonly used to detect pathogens and food toxins. Commonly, the light system in these biosensors is fluorescence, since this type of optical measurement can greatly amplify the signal.

A range of immuno- and ligand-binding assays for the detection and measurement of small molecules such as water-soluble vitamins and chemical contaminants (drug residues) such as sulfonamides and Beta-agonists have been developed for use on SPR based sensor systems, often adapted from existing ELISA or other immunological assay. These are in widespread use across the food industry.

===Detection/monitoring of pollutants===
Biosensors could be used to monitor air, water, and soil pollutants such as pesticides, potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic, and/or toxic substances and endocrine disrupting chemicals.

For example, bionanotechnologists developed a viable biosensor, , that can detect levels of diverse water pollutants.

===Ozone measurement===
Because ozone filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation, the discovery of holes in the ozone layer of the earth&#x27;s atmosphere has raised concern about how much ultraviolet light reaches the earth&#x27;s surface. Of particular concern are the questions of how deeply into sea water ultraviolet radiation penetrates and how it affects marine organisms, especially plankton (floating microorganisms) and viruses that attack plankton. Plankton form the base of the marine food chains and are believed to affect our planet&#x27;s temperature and weather by uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis.

Deneb Karentz, a researcher at the Laboratory of Radio-biology and Environmental Health (University of California, San Francisco) has devised a simple method for measuring ultraviolet penetration and intensity. Working in the Antarctic Ocean, she submerged to various depths thin plastic bags containing special strains of &quot;E. coli&quot; that are almost totally unable to repair ultraviolet radiation damage to their DNA. Bacterial death rates in these bags were compared with rates in unexposed control bags of the same organism. The bacterial &quot;biosensors&quot; revealed constant significant ultraviolet damage at depths of 10 m and frequently at 20 and 30 m. Karentz plans additional studies of how ultraviolet may affect seasonal plankton blooms (growth spurts) in the oceans.

=== Metastatic cancer cell detection ===

Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another via either the circulatory system or lymphatic system. Unlike radiology imaging tests (mammograms), which send forms of energy (x-rays, magnetic fields, etc.) through the body to only take interior pictures, biosensors have the potential to directly test the malignant power of the tumor. The combination of a biological and detector element allows for a small sample requirement, a compact design, rapid signals, rapid detection, high selectivity and high sensitivity for the analyte being studied. Compared to the usual radiology imaging tests biosensors have the advantage of not only finding out how far cancer has spread and checking if treatment is effective but also are cheaper, more efficient (in time, cost and productivity) ways to assess metastaticity in early stages of cancer.

Biological engineering researchers have created oncological biosensors for breast cancer. Breast cancer is the leading common cancer among women worldwide. An example would be a transferrin- quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). As a biosensor, quartz crystal microbalances produce oscillations in the frequency of the crystal&#x27;s standing wave from an alternating potential to detect nano-gram mass changes. These biosensors are specifically designed to interact and have high selectivity for receptors on cell (cancerous and normal) surfaces. Ideally, this provides a quantitative detection of cells with this receptor per surface area instead of a qualitative picture detection given by mammograms.

Seda Atay, a biotechnology researcher at Hacettepe University, experimentally observed this specificity and selectivity between a QCM and MDA-MB 231 breast cells, MCF 7 cells, and starved MDA-MB 231 cells in vitro. With other researchers she devised a method of washing these different metastatic leveled cells over the sensors to measure mass shifts due to different quantities of transferrin receptors. Particularly, the metastatic power of breast cancer cells can be determined by Quartz crystal microbalances with nanoparticles and transferrin that would potentially attach to transferrin receptors on cancer cell surfaces. There is very high selectivity for transferrin receptors because they are over-expressed in cancer cells. If cells have high expression of transferrin receptors, which shows their high metastatic power, they have higher affinity and bind more to the QCM that measures the increase in mass. Depending on the magnitude of the nano-gram mass change, the metastatic power can be determined.

Additionally, in the last years, significant attentions have been focused to detect the biomarkers of lung cancer without biopsy. In this regard, biosensors are very attractive and applicable tools for providing rapid, sensitive, specific, stable, cost-effective and non-invasive detections for early lung cancer diagnosis. Thus, cancer biosensors consisting of specific biorecognition molecules such as antibodies, complementary nucleic acid probes or other immobilized biomolecules on a transducer surface. The biorecognition molecules interact specifically with the biomarkers (targets) and the generated biological responses are converted by the transducer into a measurable analytical signal. Depending on the type of biological response, various transducers are utilized in the fabrication of cancer biosensors such as electrochemical, optical and mass-based transducers.

=== Pathogen detection ===

Biosensors could be used for the detection of pathogenic organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1002/bab.1621&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedded biosensors for pathogenic signatures – such as of SARS-CoV-2 – that are wearable have been developed – such as face masks with built-in tests. See also: COVID-19 public transport R&amp;D

New types of biosensor-chips could enable novel methods &quot;such as drone-deployed pathogen sensors actively surveying air or wastewater&quot;. Protein-binding aptamers could be used for testing for infectious disease pathogens. Systems of electronic skins (or robot skins) with built-in biosensors (or chemical sensors) and human-machine interfaces may enable wearable as well as remote sensed device- or robotic-sensing of pathogens (as well as of several hazardous materials and tactile perceptions).

== Types ==
=== Optical biosensors ===
Many optical biosensors are based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. This utilises a property of gold and other materials (metals); specifically that a thin layer of gold on a high refractive index glass surface can absorb laser light, producing electron waves (surface plasmons) on the gold surface. This occurs only at a specific angle and wavelength of incident light and is highly dependent on the surface of the gold, such that binding of a target analyte to a receptor on the gold surface produces a measurable signal.

Surface plasmon resonance sensors operate using a sensor chip consisting of a plastic cassette supporting a glass plate, one side of which is coated with a microscopic layer of gold. This side contacts the optical detection apparatus of the instrument. The opposite side is then contacted with a microfluidic flow system. The contact with the flow system creates channels across which reagents can be passed in solution. This side of the glass sensor chip can be modified in a number of ways, to allow easy attachment of molecules of interest. Normally it is coated in carboxymethyl dextran or similar compound.

The refractive index at the flow side of the chip surface has a direct influence on the behavior of the light reflected off the gold side. Binding to the flow side of the chip has an effect on the refractive index and in this way biological interactions can be measured to a high degree of sensitivity with some sort of energy. The refractive index of the medium near the surface changes when biomolecules attach to the surface, and the SPR angle varies as a function of this change.

Light of a fixed wavelength is reflected off the gold side of the chip at the angle of total internal reflection, and detected inside the instrument. The angle of incident light is varied in order to match the evanescent wave propagation rate with the propagation rate of the surface plasmon polaritons. This induces the evanescent wave to penetrate through the glass plate and some distance into the liquid flowing over the surface.

Other optical biosensors are mainly based on changes in absorbance or fluorescence of an appropriate indicator compound and do not need a total internal reflection geometry. For example, a fully operational prototype device detecting casein in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on detecting changes in absorption of a gold layer. A widely used research tool, the micro-array, can also be considered a biosensor.

=== Biological biosensors ===
Biological biosensors, also known as optogenetic sensors, often incorporate a genetically modified form of a native protein or enzyme. The protein is configured to detect a specific analyte and the ensuing signal is read by a detection instrument such as a fluorometer or luminometer. An example of a recently developed biosensor is one for detecting cytosolic concentration of the analyte cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a second messenger involved in cellular signaling triggered by ligands interacting with receptors on the cell membrane. Similar systems have been created to study cellular responses to native ligands or xenobiotics (toxins or small molecule inhibitors). Such &quot;assays&quot; are commonly used in drug discovery development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Most cAMP assays in current use require lysis of the cells prior to measurement of cAMP. A live-cell biosensor for cAMP can be used in non-lysed cells with the additional advantage of multiple reads to study the kinetics of receptor response.

Nanobiosensors use an immobilized bioreceptor probe that is selective for target analyte molecules. Nanomaterials are exquisitely sensitive chemical and biological sensors. Nanoscale materials demonstrate unique properties. Their large surface area to volume ratio can achieve rapid and low cost reactions, using a variety of designs.
Other evanescent wave biosensors have been commercialised using waveguides where the propagation constant through the waveguide is changed by the absorption of molecules to the waveguide surface. One such example, dual polarisation interferometry uses a buried waveguide as a reference against which the change in propagation constant is measured. Other configurations such as the Mach–Zehnder have reference arms lithographically defined on a substrate. Higher levels of integration can be achieved using resonator geometries where the resonant frequency of a ring resonator changes when molecules are absorbed.

=== Electronic nose devices ===

Recently, arrays of many different detector molecules have been applied in so called electronic nose devices, where the pattern of response from the detectors is used to fingerprint a substance. In the Wasp Hound odor-detector, the mechanical element is a video camera and the biological element is five parasitic wasps who have been conditioned to swarm in response to the presence of a specific chemical. Current commercial electronic noses, however, do not use biological elements.

===DNA biosensors===
DNA can be the analyte of a biosensor, being detected through specific means, but it can also be used as part of a biosensor or, theoretically, even as a whole biosensor.

Many techniques exist to detect DNA, which is usually a means to detect organisms that have that particular DNA. DNA sequences can also be used as described above. But more forward-looking approaches exist, where DNA can be synthesized to hold enzymes in a biological, stable gel. Other applications are the design of aptamers, sequences of DNA that have a specific shape to bind a desired molecule. The most innovative processes use DNA origami for this, creating sequences that fold in a predictable structure that is useful for detection.

Scientists have built prototype sensors to detect DNA of animals from sucked in air, &quot;airborne eDNA&quot;.

&quot;Nanoantennas&quot; made out of DNA – a novel type of nano-scale optical antenna – can be attached to proteins and produce a signal via fluorescence when these perform their biological functions, in particular for distinct conformational changes.

=== Graphene-based biosensor ===
Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon-based substance with superior optical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The ability to absorb and immobilize a variety of proteins, particularly some with carbon ring structures, has proven graphene to be an excellent candidate as a biosensor transducer. As a result, various graphene-based biosensors have been explored and developed in recent times.
 Graphene has been employed as a biosensor in various formats especially electrochemical sensors and field effect transistors. Amongst them graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) especially have shown excellent performance as rapid point of care (PoC) diagnostics as observed through a surge in number of research articles reporting COVID-19 diagnostics using GFETs. They have been reported to have some of the lowest limit of detection whilst also having a rapid turn around time of a few seconds along with multiplexing abilities. These capabilities allow for immediate disease detection especially in cases with overlapping symptoms which are hard to distinguish at the outset, thus allowing for better patient outcomes especially in resource strained medical settings.

<doc id="480721" wikidata="Q658568" url="?curid=480721" title="Valérian and Laureline">
<text>Valérian and Laureline (), originally titled Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent () and also commonly known as Valérian, is a French science fiction comics series, created by writer Pierre Christin and artist Jean-Claude Mézières. It was first published in &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine in 1967; the final installment was published in 2010. All of the &quot;Valérian&quot; stories have been collected in comic album format, comprising some twenty-one volumes plus a short story collection and an encyclopædia.

The series focuses on the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the universe through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave, who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is the wrong thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin&#x27;s scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières&#x27;s art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well; traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.

Many of the stories have been translated into several languages, including English. The series has received recognition through a number of prestigious awards, including the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême. An animated television series, &quot;Time Jam: Valerian &amp; Laureline&quot;, was released in 2007, and a feature film directed by Luc Besson, &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, was released in 2017.

==Concept and setting==
The original setting for the series was the 28th century. Humanity has discovered the means of travelling instantaneously through time and space. The capital of Earth, Galaxity, is the centre of the vast Terran Galactic Empire. Earth itself has become a virtual utopia with most of the population living a life of leisure in a virtual reality dream-state ruled by the benign Technocrats of the First Circle. The Spatio-Temporal Service protects the planets of the Terran Empire and guards against temporal paradoxes caused by rogue time-travellers. Valérian and Laureline are two such spatio-temporal agents.

However, since the end of the story &quot;The Wrath of Hypsis&quot; (&quot;Les Foudres d&#x27;Hypsis&quot;), in which Galaxity disappears from space-time as a result of a temporal paradox, the pair have become freelance trouble-shooters travelling through space and time offering their services to anyone willing to hire them while also searching for their lost home.

In the first two albums Valérian travels through time in a two-seater device, the &quot;XB27&quot;, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in &quot;Les Mauvais Rêves&quot; (&quot;Bad Dreams&quot;) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship &quot;XB982&quot;, which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story &quot;The Great Collector&quot; (&quot;Le Grand Collectionneur&quot;). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.

The initial albums were generally straightforward good versus evil adventure stories. However, thanks to Pierre Christin&#x27;s interest in politics, sociology, and ethnology, as the series progressed the situations typically arose from misunderstandings or ideological differences between various groups that could be resolved through reason and perseverance. The core theme of the stories is an optimistic liberal humanism: the adventures are not about defeating enemies but about exploring, facing challenges, and celebrating diversity. Thus, according to the academic John Dean, Christin &quot;as a rule works into his narratives political, environmental and feminist concerns – thereby showing social ills are universal, no matter on what planet you land&quot;.

Another concept that developed was Galaxity as a proxy for Western democracy; contrary to its benign self-image it is actually imperialist and prone to a corrupt real-politik. Other themes include:
* Natural simplicity as superior to technological complexity.
* Rejection of machismo, violence and war in favour of femininity and nature.
* Distrust of power and the suppression of individuality.
* The ability of women to manipulate males sexually without being manipulated themselves.

These themes are underpinned by the vivid drawings of Jean-Claude Mézières, whose &quot;visually stunning backgrounds: complex architecture, futuristic machines, otherworldly landscapes and odd-looking aliens&quot;, are what John Dean calls &quot;staples of Mézières&#x27; seeming boundless visual inventiveness&quot;, resulting in what the artist Pepo Pérez likens to &quot;&quot;National Geographic&quot;, but on a cosmic scale&quot;.

==Principal characters==
===Valérian===
Valérian was born on Earth, in Galaxity, capital of the Terran Galactic Empire in the 28th century. He joined the Spatio-Temporal Service in the year 2713. He has been trained to think that Galaxity is always right – even when he receives orders that go against his morals he will, reluctantly, follow them. He much prefers to be a man of action than sitting around pondering what course to take next.

The early stories present Valérian as a typical square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and dependable (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In &quot;World Without Stars&quot; (&quot;Le Pays sans étoile&quot;), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists&#x27; home-made booze, in &quot;On the False Earths&quot; (&quot;Sur les terres truquées&quot;), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in &quot;Heroes of the Equinox&quot; (&quot;Les Héros de l&#x27;Equinoxe&quot;), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in &quot;Heroes of the Equinox&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos&quot;.

When Galaxity disappears in &quot;The Wrath of Hypsis&quot; he contemplates following his fellows into oblivion, much to Laureline&#x27;s horror. Even afterwards, he feels the loss of Galaxity much more than Laureline, as it is his birthplace.

The name Valérian comes from Eastern Europe, although its origin is Latin, from &quot;valere&quot; (&quot;to be strong&quot;). Valérian was created by Mézières and Christin as a reaction to the fearless boy-scout (e.g. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;) and American superhero characters that were prevalent in comics available in France at the time. Instead they sought to devise a &quot;banal character&quot; with &quot;no extraordinary means of action&quot;. Eventually, with Christin feeling that they had gone too far with this angle and that the Valérian character had become too stupid, from &quot;The Ghosts of Inverloch&quot; (&quot;Les Spectres d&#x27;Inverloch&quot;) onwards, Valérian was made more sympathetic and given a greater piece of the action.

In &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, a 2017 movie by Luc Besson, Valérian is played by Dane DeHaan.

===Laureline===
Laureline is a peasant girl from 11th-century France. In the debut adventure, &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;, she rescues Valérian from the enchanted Forest of Arelaune. When she accidentally discovers Valérian is a time-traveller, he is forced to bring her back with him to Galaxity where she is trained as a Spatio-Temporal Agent and assigned as his partner.

In the early stories, Laureline generally sits in the background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops. &quot;World Without Stars&quot;, the fourth serial published in &quot;Pilote&quot;, the two characters are separated for most of the adventure, with Laureline stepping out from under Valérian&#x27;s shadow for the first time, and she proves to be more than an equal to Valérian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.

&quot;Welcome to Alflolol&quot; (&quot;Bienvenue sur Alflolol&quot;) brings Laureline&#x27;s rebellious nature to the fore; unlike Valérian, she has not been born and raised by Galaxity and is prepared not only to question Galaxity&#x27;s authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in &quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Ambassadeur des Ombres&quot;), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in &quot;The Living Weapons&quot; (&quot;Les Armes Vivantes&quot;).

Despite being independent and efficacious, Laureline is not afraid to exploit her considerable sex appeal if it is to her advantage. For example, she attracts the attention of the Emperor of Valsennar in &quot;World Without Stars&quot; and, dressed in leather gear and boots, she manipulates Crocbattler and Rackalust in &quot;Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos&quot; and regularly charms the Shingouz when negotiating with them for information. She has appeared nude in some adventures. Mézières drew a picture of her for the French edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1987.

She also has a certain affinity for animals such as the Alflololian Goumon in &quot;Welcome to Alflolol&quot;, the Grumpy Converter from Bluxte, first seen in &quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot;, and the Tüm Tüm (de Lüm) and the Tchoung-Tracer, both introduced in &quot;On the Frontiers&quot; (&quot;Sur les Frontières&quot;).

The name &quot;Laureline&quot; was invented by Mézières and Christin who were seeking a name that would sound &quot;medieval&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;. The name has proven popular and there are now several thousand women in France named Laureline, the first one born in 1968, just a year after the publication of &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;. There have also been variations such as &quot;Loreline&quot; and &quot;Laurelyne&quot;. Laureline was initially created just for the first story, &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;, but recognising that they had a female character who was different from the bimbo types common to comics of the time, Mézières and Christin fell for her and, in response to positive reader feedback, retained her for the subsequent stories.

In &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, a 2017 movie by Luc Besson, Laureline is played by Cara Delevingne.

===Other characters===

====Mr Albert====

Mr Albert is Galaxity&#x27;s contact on 20th-century Earth. He makes his first appearance in &quot;Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia&quot;. He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives in the suburbs of Paris, France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery. He is also a pigeon fancier and uses his carrier pigeons to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved in the thick of the action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.

The character of Albert is partially influenced by that of August Faust, the main character in the strip &quot;The Extraordinary and Troubling Adventure of Mr August Faust&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;extraordinaire et Troublante Aventure de M. August Faust&quot;), written by Fred and drawn by Mézières in 1967. 

====The Shingouz====

The Shingouz are aliens who make their first appearance in &quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot; and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums. They are brown, short-furred creatures, slightly less than a metre tall, resembling flightless birds with a snout instead of a beak.

Shingouz have a high alcohol tolerance and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have struck up a relationship with a group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.

In the feature film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, the Shingouz are replaced with the similar negotiating species Dogan Daguis.

==Origins==

Childhood friends Jean-Claude Mézières and Pierre Christin had previously collaborated on the comic strip &quot;Le Rhum du Punch&quot; (&quot;Rum Punch&quot;) in 1966 while both were living and working in the United States. Upon their return to France they initially intended to create a Western strip but, with the genre already well represented in French comics thanks to &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot; and &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;, Christin instead proposed that they turn their hand to science fiction, a genre he felt was unrepresented in French comics at the time. The decision to work in the science fiction genre was also influenced by the political climate in France at the time; Mézières and Christin saw &quot;Valérian&quot; as a &quot;backdoor&quot; means to react against the prevailing doctrine of Gaullism. Although science fiction was not a favourite of &quot;Pilote&quot; editor René Goscinny, Goscinny wanted his magazine to be diverse and innovative and so agreed to commission &quot;Valérian&quot;.

There had been French science fiction comics before &quot;Valérian&quot; such as Kline&#x27;s &quot;Kaza the Martian&quot; (a childhood favourite of Mézières), Roger Lecureux and Raymond Poivet&#x27;s &quot;Les Pionniers de l&#x27;Espérance&quot; &quot;(The Pioneers of Hope)&quot; (which Christin found tired and repetitive) and Jean-Claude Forest&#x27;s &quot;Barbarella&quot;. &quot;Barbarella&quot; is famous for its strong female titular character, but Christin has denied any influence on the character of Laureline, stating that she was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot; as well as the burgeoning feminist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, contemporary reviews of the early stories by Jean-Pierre Andrevon describe the books as &quot;Forestian&quot;. Mézières and Christin were also heavily influenced by literary science fiction such as that by Isaac Asimov (especially &quot;The End of Eternity&quot;), Jack Vance (especially &quot;The Blue World&quot;), and John Brunner. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier have also suggested that Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Time Patrol&quot; books, about an official organization dedicated to protecting time from interference, are a major influence on the series.

Christin has also cited the whodunit genre—notably novels by Georges Simenon and Ed McBain—as an influence on &quot;Valérian&quot; since they taught him, as a writer, that all characters in a narrative must be seen to have motivations.

Mézières&#x27;s drawings in the early albums were influenced by such &quot;comic-dynamic&quot; artists as Morris (&quot;Lucky Luke&quot;), André Franquin (&quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;) and Jack Davis (&quot;Mad&quot; magazine), leading Jean-Pierre Andrevon to refer to &quot;Valérian&quot; as &quot;a kind of &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; of space-time&quot;. As the series progressed, Mézières developed a more realistic style, akin to that of Jijé, though in more recent albums he has returned to the more cartoonish style of the earlier stories.

==Legacy==

===In comics===

&quot;Valérian&#x27;s&quot; arrival on the French comics scene was contemporaneous with the debuts of other notable French science fiction strips including &quot;Luc Orient&quot; by Greg and Eddy Paape and &quot;Lone Sloane&quot; by Philippe Druillet. The success of these strips would eventually lead to the creation of &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, the highly influential French comics magazine dedicated to science fiction. The influence of &quot;Valérian&quot; has been noticed in such strips as &quot;&quot; (by Víctor Mora and Carlos Giménez) and &quot;Gigantik&quot; (by Mora and José Maria Cardona). The visual style of &quot;Valérian&quot; has also influenced some American comics artists, notably Walt Simonson and Gil Kane. Sometimes the impact of &quot;Valérian&quot; has gone beyond mere influence; following a complaint by Mézières, the artist Angus McKie admitted that several panels of his strip &quot;So Beautiful and So Dangerous&quot; were copied from &quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot;.

===In other media===
Outside of comics, the &quot;Valérian&quot; series has been particularly influential on science fiction and fantasy film.

Several commentators, such as Kim Thompson of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, film critic Jean-Philippe Guerand and the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, have noted certain similarities between the &quot;Valérian&quot; albums and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. Both series are noted for the &quot;lived-in&quot; look given to their various settings and for the diverse alien creatures they feature. Mézières&#x27;s response upon seeing &quot;Star Wars&quot; was that he was &quot;dazzled, jealous ... and furious!&quot;. As a riposte, Mézières produced an illustration for &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine in 1983 depicting the &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa meeting Valérian and Laureline in a bar surrounded by a bestiary of alien creatures typical of that seen in both series. &quot;Fancy meeting you here!&quot; says Leia. &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ve been hanging around here for a long time!&quot; retorts Laureline. Mézières has since been informed that Doug Chiang, design director on &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, kept a set of &quot;Valérian&quot; albums in his library.

Mézières has also noticed similarities between some of the sets in the 1982 film &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and the planet seen in &quot;Birds of the Master&quot; (&quot;Les Oiseaux du Maître&quot;) and between some of the production sketches for the alien fighters in the 1996 film &quot;Independence Day&quot; and Valérian and Laureline&#x27;s astroship.

The 1999 Danish film &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot;, directed by Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, features a character, Rud, who is a fan of &quot;Linda and Valentin&quot; (as &quot;Valérian&quot; is known in Denmark) who believes the character of Liva is in fact Linda (i.e. Laureline).

Jean-Claude Mézières himself has worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for director Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel&#x27;s novel &quot;La Nuit des temps&quot; (&quot;The Ice People&quot;). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot; for director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières&#x27;s concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in &quot;Mézières Extras&quot;.

In 1991 Mézières began work producing concept art for the director Luc Besson for his film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. When the project stalled and Besson moved on to work on the film &quot;Léon&quot; in 1994, Mézières returned to &quot;Valérian&quot; for the album &quot;The Circles of Power&quot; (&quot;Les Cercles du Pouvoir&quot;). This featured a character, S&#x27;Traks, who drove a flying taxi around a great metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières sent a copy of the album to Besson who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas, the lead character of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Mézières produced further concept drawings for Besson, including flying taxi cabs. He also re-used certain aspects of the design of the space liner seen in the 1988 &quot;Valérian&quot; album &quot;On the Frontiers&quot; for the Fhloston Paradise liner seen in second half of the film. &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was finally completed and released in 1997. The importance of the four classical elements to the film is similar to the significance the elements have in the two-part &quot;Valérian&quot; story &quot;Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos&quot;. However, Besson has claimed that he first came up with the idea for the film at the age of 16 which would pre-date the publication of these two albums.

Gary Numan used the name &quot;Valerian&quot; early in his career.

===Awards===
&quot;Valérian&quot; and its creators have also received recognition through a number of prestigious awards. Most notably, in 1984, Jean-Claude Mézières was honoured with the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême for his comics work, including &quot;Valérian&quot;. Mézières and Christin also received a European Science Fiction Society award for &quot;Valérian&quot; in 1987 and the album &quot;Hostages of the Ultralum&quot; (&quot;Otages de l&#x27;Ultralum&quot;) won a Tournesal award, given to the comic that best reflects the ideals of the Green Party, at the 1997 Angoulême International Comics Festival. The encyclopedia of the alien creatures found in the &quot;Valérian&quot; universe &quot;Les Habitants du Ciel: Atlas Cosmique de Valérian et Laureline&quot; (&quot;The Inhabitants of the Sky: The Cosmic Atlas of Valerian and Laureline&quot;) received a special mention by the jury at the 1992 Angoulême International Comics Festival in the Prix Jeunesse 9–12 ans (Youth Prize 9–12 years) category.

&quot;Valérian&quot; has also been nominated for a Haxtur Award in 1995 for &quot;The Circles of Power&quot; and for a Harvey Award in 2005 for &quot;The New Future Trilogy&quot;, an English-language compilation of three of the albums.
==Publication history==
===Original publication===
&quot;Valérian&quot; first appeared on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;, and every &quot;Valérian&quot; story from &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; to &quot;The Wrath of Hypsis&quot; was initially serialised in &quot;Pilote&quot;. The second &quot;Valérian&quot; story, &quot;The City of Shifting Waters&quot; (&quot;La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes&quot;), was the first to be collected in graphic novel album format by Dargaud. Since &quot;On the Frontiers&quot;, every &quot;Valérian&quot; story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the digest-sized &quot;Super Pocket Pilote&quot; in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in &quot;Across the Pathways of Space&quot; (&quot;Par Les Chemins De l’Espace&quot;) in 1997. The series was originally published under the title &quot;Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent&quot;. However, with the publication of &quot;The Order of the Stones&quot; in 2007, the series now goes under the title &quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot;.

On 22 January 2010, the last album, &quot;L&#x27;OuvreTemps&quot; (&quot;The Time Opener&quot;), was published. With this album the authors concluded the entire comic series with the intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, &quot;Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu&quot; (&quot;Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared&quot;), and indicated that Valérian and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.

===English translations===

The first &quot;Valérian&quot; album to be translated into English was &quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot; which was serialised across four issues of the magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in 1981 (Volume 4, Number 10 (January 1981) to Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1981)).

&quot;Ambassador of the Shadows&quot; was later republished in English in album format as were &quot;World Without Stars&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Alflolol&quot; and &quot;Heroes of the Equinox&quot; by the short-lived Dargaud-USA and Dargaud-Canada between 1981 and 1984 and in the United Kingdom by Hodder-Dargaud in 1984 and 1985.

In 1989 it was announced that NBM Publishing were going to reissue the four English language albums published by Dargaud-USA and also release a translation of &quot;Empire of a Thousand Planets&quot; but nothing seems to have come of this.

&quot;Heroes of the Equinox&quot; was republished in July 1996 in black and white by &quot;Fantasy Flight Publishing&quot; (an offshoot of &quot;Fantasy Flight Games&quot;) in two issues as standard American sized comic-books as part of an unsuccessful attempt to translate and print several European comic book series including &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; and &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;.

In November 2004, iBooks published &quot;Valérian: The New Future Trilogy&quot;, collecting the albums &quot;On the Frontiers&quot;, &quot;The Living Weapons&quot; and &quot;The Circles of Power&quot; in one volume reduced to standard American graphic novel size. These were the only &quot;Valérian&quot; stories &quot;iBooks&quot; published and the company has since declared bankruptcy.

Since July 2010, UK publisher Cinebook has been publishing English language editions of Valérian. These began at a rate of one volume every six months. However, as the cinematic release of Luc Besson&#x27;s film&quot; Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets &quot;approached, the rate increased to one every three months. Twenty-two volumes had been published by the end of 2017. Pursuant the individual softcover title releases, the publisher announced in December 2016 a complete hardcover book series, &quot;aka&quot; &quot;Intégrales&quot;, of Valérian, slated to launch in 2017 as &quot;Valerian - The Complete Collection&quot;. Completed in 2018, each outing in the seven-volume series collects 3-4 titles of the original individual book releases. An international effort, Cinebook&#x27;s release was, save for the language, identical to the ones concurrently released in French, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil only), and Standard Chinese.

===In other languages===
Many of the &quot;Valérian&quot; stories have, be it in part or in whole as a series, been translated from their original French into several other languages besides English, including German (as &quot;Valerian und Veronique&quot;), Dutch (as &quot;Ravian: Tijd/ruimte-agent&quot;), the Scandinavian languages (Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish) (as &quot;Linda og/och Valentin&quot;), Finnish (as &quot;Valerian ja Laureline&quot; and previously as &quot;Avaruusagentti Valerianin seikkailuja&quot;), Spanish, Portuguese (as &quot;Valérian, agente espácio-temporal&quot;), Serbian (as &quot;Valerijan&quot;), Italian, Turkish, Polish, Indonesian and Standard Chinese. &quot;Intégrale&#x27; editions have been published in several of these languages as well, of which the later, aforementioned Cinebook version and those of its international companions incidentally, were merely slightly updated editions, only enhanced with a long interview with the two creators and film director Luc Besson, spread over the individual volumes of the collection.

==Adaptations to other media==

===Animated television series===

The notion of making an animated adaptation of &quot;Valérian&quot; dates back to at least 1976. In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled &quot;The Asteroids of Shimballil&quot; (&quot;Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil&quot;) which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Dargaud Films&quot; financed the production of a three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by &quot;Studio 32&quot; in Paris and Luxembourg, but nothing came of this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in &quot;Mézières Extras&quot;. Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing came of this attempt either.

An animated series entitled &quot;Time Jam: Valerian and Laureline&quot; made its debut on Canal+ Family in France on 20 October 2007. In total, forty 26-minute episodes have been made. The series is a Franco–Japanese co-production, directed by Philippe Vidal.

The scripts were written by a French team under the supervision of Peter Berts; while Charles Vaucelles was responsible for the realisation of the characters and Vincent Momméja was responsible for the design of the locations and spacecraft. Music is by Alexandre Azzaria. In the French dub of the series Valérian is voiced by Gwendal Anglade and Laureline by Mélodie Orru. Three trailers were released to promote the series: the first on 24 April 2006, the second on 10 October 2006 and the third on 30 August 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blog/3rdTrailer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The series differs from the original comics in that Valerian comes from the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics Valerian takes Laureline back to the 28th century without any trouble, in the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the Solar System.

According to Animation World Network, &quot;&quot;Time Jam - Valerian &amp; Laureline&quot; sets out to answer the question: Where on Earth has Earth gone? Valerian and Laureline, our two young heroes, seem to be the only representatives of the human race in the unsafe galaxy where the nightmarish Vlagos are conspiring to control the world. Sent out on an assignment by the head of STS (the Spatial-Temporal Service), Valerian and Laureline discover the existence of a time-portal, a mysterious phenomenon, which may hold the key to the recovery of Earth. The series from Dargaud Marina mixes 2D and CGI animation with an anime touch&quot;. The series has also been sold to Belgium, Spain, Israel and Morocco.

===Feature film===

In 2012, it was announced that Luc Besson planned to make a movie for the big screen of Valérian and Laureline. The film was shot in January 2016 and stars Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne. It was released on 21 July 2017.

<text>A mouth organ is any free reed aerophone with one or more air chambers fitted with a free reed.
Though it spans many traditions, it is played universally the same way by the musician placing their lips over a chamber or holes in the instrument, and blowing or sucking air to create a sound. Many of the chambers can be played together or each individually.

The mouth organ can be found all around the world and is known by many different names and seen in many different traditions. The most notable variations include the harmonica, and Asian free reed wind instruments consisting of a number of bamboo pipes of varying lengths fixed into a wind chest; these include the &quot;sheng&quot;, &quot;khaen&quot;, &quot;lusheng&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;, &quot;shō&quot;, and &quot;saenghwang&quot;. The melodica, consisting of a single tube that is essentially blown through a keyboard, is another variation.

<doc id="480735" wikidata="Q924232" url="?curid=480735" title="Vince Gill">
<text>Vincent Grant Gill (born April 12, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He began in a number of local bluegrass bands in the 1970s, and from 1978 to 1982, he achieved his first mainstream attention after taking over as lead singer of the soft rock band Pure Prairie League. Gill sang lead on their hit single &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight&quot; in addition to writing several songs of theirs. After leaving Pure Prairie League, Gill briefly played guitar in Rodney Crowell&#x27;s backing band the Cherry Bombs before beginning a solo career in country music in 1984. Gill recorded for RCA Records Nashville from then until 1988 with minimal success. A year later he signed with MCA Nashville, and he has recorded for this label ever since.

His commercial peak came in the first half of the 1990s, starting with his breakthrough album &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot;. Gill has 65 entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, including four solo number one hits: &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Our Love Start Slippin&#x27; Away&quot;, &quot;One More Last Chance&quot;, and &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get Over You&quot;, all between 1992 and 1994. He has also had number-one singles as a guest on Reba McEntire&#x27;s &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot; in 1993, as well as Chris Young&#x27;s &quot;Sober Saturday Night&quot; and the multi-artist collaboration &quot;Forever Country&quot;, both in 2016. All of Gill&#x27;s albums released in the 1990s were certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the highest being 1992&#x27;s &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; at quintuple-platinum. Gill has won 22 Grammy Awards, the most among solo male country music artists.

Gill was a member of Western swing group the Time Jumpers from 2010 to 2020, and joined the rock band Eagles in 2017 following the death of longtime member Glenn Frey. He has also participated in a variety of collaborations, including songs by Patty Loveless, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Kelly Clarkson, and Maren Morris. From 1980 to 1997 he was married to Janis Oliver, one-half of the country duo Sweethearts of the Rodeo; after they divorced, he married contemporary Christian music singer Amy Grant in 2000. Additionally, Gill has written songs for Alabama and Ty Herndon, and holds a number of credits as a backing vocalist and session musician.

Gill&#x27;s music is known for his songwriting, his tenor singing voice, and his lead guitar work, with many critics noting his prolificacy in both ballads and up-tempo material. In addition to guitar, he plays mandolin, banjo, and Dobro.

==Biography==

Vincent Grant Gill was born April 12, 1957, in Norman, Oklahoma, as the youngest of three children to Jerene and Stan Gill. Stan Gill worked as a judge and also played guitar and banjo, both of which he also taught his son how to play. Jerene also sang and played harmonica. The Gill family often listened to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio, as well as contemporary rock and roll artists. Both parents also enjoyed golf, a pastime which Gill himself would develop as well. As a child, Gill began playing a guitar his grandmother owned, and learned how to play &quot;Old Shep&quot; on it when he was five years old; three years later, he and his half-brother Bob played the Beach Boys&#x27;s &quot;Long Tall Texan&quot; on a local radio show. Gill also took guitar lessons from a local guitarist named J. Julian Akins. Additionally, Gill brought his guitar to school for show and tell a number of times, where he would entertain students by playing &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;. Gill also learned how to play Dobro, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, and bass guitar during his teenage years.

He developed an interest in bluegrass music after becoming friends with the son of his father&#x27;s friend, who was a fan of the genre and also played mandolin. After graduating high school, Gill chose to become a lead guitarist performer. He briefly founded his own bluegrass band called Mountain Smoke, which once opened for the hard rock band Kiss. According to Gill, the crowd began booing and throwing objects on the stage during Mountain Smoke&#x27;s set, to which he responded by flipping the bird and mooning them before leaving the stage. After Mountain Smoke disbanded, Gill moved to the state of Kentucky. There he played in the bands Bluegrass Alliance and Boone Creek, the latter of which also featured Ricky Skaggs as a member. In 1976, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he briefly joined fiddle player Byron Berline&#x27;s backing band, Sundance.

==Music career==
===Early 1980s: Pure Prairie League and the Cherry Bombs===
In 1978, soft rock band Pure Prairie League was auditioning for new lead singers after their previous vocalist Larry Goshorn departed. Gill attended the auditions at the recommendation of a friend, as he had served as an opening act for the band while in Mountain Smoke. By October 1978, Gill had begun performing in concert as guitarist and vocalist for Pure Prairie League. He appeared on their 1979 album &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; in addition to writing several songs on it. During Gill&#x27;s tenure as lead vocalist, the band had a top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight&quot;; he also wrote its follow-up &quot;I&#x27;m Almost Ready&quot;, as well as five other songs on the corresponding album &quot;Firin&#x27; Up&quot;. Of this album, Joe Viglione of AllMusic thought that Gill&#x27;s contributions to the album were &quot;highly entertaining&quot; and showed more of a country pop and adult contemporary influence than his later works. By comparison, Jim Worbois wrote of &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; on the same site, &quot;By this time, they are [Pure Prairie League] in name only as there is no resemblance between this and the original band.&quot; Overall, Gill recorded three albums as lead singer of Pure Prairie League.

In 1982, Gill was invited by singer Rodney Crowell to play guitar in his backing band, the Cherry Bombs. Gill had previously been offered to do so during the success of &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight&quot; and declined, but chose to accept Crowell&#x27;s offer the second time because the following singles and albums had not been successful. As a result, he quit Pure Prairie League and was replaced by Gary Burr. His role as guitarist in the Cherry Bombs also led to him briefly playing guitar for Crowell&#x27;s then-wife, Rosanne Cash. Because of these roles, Gill moved to Nashville, Tennessee, a year later.

===19831988: Beginning of solo career===

Another member of the Cherry Bombs, keyboardist and record producer Tony Brown, became the president of artists and repertoire at RCA Records Nashville in 1983. As Gill wanted to become a solo artist, Brown recommended him to Joe Galante, then an executive of the same label, who signed him that same year. Shortly before his signing with RCA, Gill also appeared as a guest vocalist on David Grisman&#x27;s &quot;Here Today&quot;, and sang backing vocals on Steve Wariner&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Fire&quot;, on which Brown was a producer.

Gill debuted on RCA in 1984 with a six-song extended play titled &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;. The project accounted for three singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts: &quot;Victim of Life&#x27;s Circumstances&quot;, &quot;Oh Carolina&quot;, and the title track, all of which peaked just within the top 40. Delbert McClinton wrote the former of these, while Gill wrote the title track. The album was produced by Emory Gordy Jr., also a member of the Cherry Bombs at the time. Despite the minimal success of &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, Gill won Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music in 1984. Word of mouth within the Nashville community towards Gill&#x27;s extended play also led to him serving as a backing vocalist and session musician for a number of other country singers. He served in this capacity for Conway Twitty and Lee Greenwood, in addition to providing backing vocals on Rosanne Cash&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Rhythm &amp; Romance&quot;.

After &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, Gill performed a number of shows at Nashville&#x27;s Bluebird Café, a popular venue for songwriters, as a means of refining his own songwriting. His first full album for RCA was 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Things That Matter&quot;. While the lead single &quot;True Love&quot; underperformed on the country charts, the follow-up &quot;If It Weren&#x27;t for Him&quot; (a duet with Cash) became Gill&#x27;s first top-ten country hit the same year. This song was originally to have been included on &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, but was delayed until &quot;The Things That Matter&quot; due to legal complications between Gill&#x27;s and Cash&#x27;s labels. &quot;The Things That Matter&quot; accounted for another top-ten in &quot;Oklahoma Borderline&quot;, which Gill wrote with Crowell and Guy Clark. &quot;With You&quot;, the final single, was less successful. To promote the album, Gill began touring as an opening act for Ricky Skaggs.

Author Jo Sgammato stated that while Gill&#x27;s first two projects for RCA were not commercially successful, both were well-received by music critics and fans. For his third RCA release, &quot;The Way Back Home&quot; (1987), Gill wanted to choose a new producer to vary his sound. He selected Richard Landis, who had previously worked with Juice Newton. Gill recalled Landis as being &quot;outspoken&quot; and initially thought Landis would make a &quot;slick pop record&quot;, but ultimately noted that Landis was open to production suggestions from Gill. In particular, Landis allowed Gill to play mandolin, banjo, and Dobro, as well as guitar. Crowell provided backing vocals, as did Sweethearts of the Rodeo, a duo consisting of Gill&#x27;s then-wife Janis and her sister Kristine. &quot;The Way Back Home&quot; produced four singles. First was &quot;Cinderella&quot;, written by Reed Nielsen, which peaked at number five on the country charts in 1987. The album&#x27;s second and third singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Something&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; were both top-20 hits, but the final single &quot;The Radio&quot; stopped at number 39 on the country charts. After this album, Gill ended his contract with RCA as Galante wanted him to record only songs by other writers. Despite this disagreement, Gill stated that he left RCA amicably and still considered Galante a friend. During Gill&#x27;s departure from RCA, Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler invited Gill to join the band on their then-upcoming world tour, but Gill declined as he wanted to stay within country music.

===19891992: Early years with MCA Nashville===
Gill had remained in contact with Tony Brown, who by 1988 was president of MCA Nashville Records and helped him sign a contract with that label in 1989. Brown would also go on to serve as Gill&#x27;s producer throughout the entirety of the 1990s. Of their relationship, Brown stated that he considered himself more of a &quot;coach&quot; due to his perception of Gill&#x27;s artistic identity. Brown also chose to put more emphasis on Gill&#x27;s vocals by mixing them more prominently than the instruments; previously, both Gordy and Landis had mixed the instruments more prominently due to Gill&#x27;s lack of confidence at the time over his singing ability. His first single release for MCA was &quot;Never Alone&quot;, previously recorded by Cash on &quot;Rhythm &amp; Romance&quot; and co-written by both of them. This was the first of four singles off his MCA debut &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot;, considered by the editors of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; to be Gill&#x27;s breakthrough album. &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot; included a large number of backing vocalists. Among them were Kathie Baillie (of Baillie &amp; the Boys), Patty Loveless, Emmylou Harris, and Herb Pedersen. The second single from the album was &quot;Oklahoma Swing&quot;, a duet with Reba McEntire. This charted within the top 20 in early 1990, with Sgammato noting that some stations refused to play the song due to its Western swing sound. It was followed by the number two title track and number three &quot;Never Knew Lonely&quot; by year&#x27;s end. &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot; also received a music video. AllMusic writer Thom Jurek praised the singles in particular, stating that the album &quot;serves as the testament to Gill&#x27;s arrival as a star and an enduring part of the country music legacy.&quot;

&quot;When I Call Your Name&quot; accounted for a number of accolades. The album itself was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1996, honoring shipments of two million copies in the United States. The title track won Gill his first Grammy Award in 1991, in the category of Best Male Vocal Country Performance; it was also nominated for Best Country Song. Additionally, the song won Single of the Year from the Country Music Association (CMA), his first award from that institution, in 1990. It would win Song of the Year in 1991, where Gill was also awarded Male Vocalist of the Year and Vocal Event of the Year. He would win the former again in 1993, 1994, and 1995. The success of &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot; led to Gill touring in support of the album, which included a concert at SeaWorld San Antonio and one opening for McEntire at Caesars Palace, along with an induction into the Grand Ole Opry.

Next on MCA was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Pocket Full of Gold&quot;. The title track charted at number seven on Hot Country Songs that same year. Follow-up &quot;Liza Jane&quot;, another collaboration between Gill and Reed Nielsen, reached the same peak. &quot;Look at Us&quot; (co-written by Gill and Max D. Barnes) and &quot;Take Your Memory with You&quot; also charted within top five between then and 1992. Gill told Bob Paxman of the blog Sounds Like Nashville that he allowed Brown to select songs for the album, as he &quot;trusted [Brown&#x27;s] song sense&quot;. &quot;Pocket Full of Gold&quot; was inspired by an idea given to Gill by Brian Allsmiller, a friend of his who at the time was playing basketball for Vanderbilt University&#x27;s college team. Although Gill wrote the song by himself, he credited Allsmiller as a co-writer. Once again, Loveless and Pedersen were among the backing vocalists. Another contributor to the album was pedal steel guitar player John Hughey, whose intro on &quot;Look at Us&quot; Gill later described as &quot;iconic&quot;. Like its predecessor, &quot;Pocket Full of Gold&quot; was also certified double-platinum. The album accounted for Gill&#x27;s second consecutive Grammy nomination in the category of Best Male Vocal Country Performance, as well as CMA Award for Song of the Year. In October 1991, Gill hosted the CMA awards telecast with Clint Black. Gill went on to host the awards ceremony every subsequent year through 2003.

===19921993: &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Peace on Earth&quot;===
The late-1992 release &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; was Gill&#x27;s third on MCA. It also became his best-selling album, receiving a quintuple-platinum RIAA certification. The title track became Gill&#x27;s first number-one on Hot Country Songs in September 1992, a peak also achieved by its follow-up &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Our Love Start Slippin&#x27; Away&quot; between December 1992 and January 1993. After this song, Gill provided duet vocals on Reba McEntire&#x27;s number-one single &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot;, on which Brown was also a producer. She had originally intended to record the song with Kenny Rogers, but after proving unable to find a key in which both of them could sing the song comfortably, she instead chose Gill. The next single off &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; was the number three &quot;No Future in the Past&quot;. Following this, &quot;One More Last Chance&quot; and &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get Over You&quot; both topped Hot Country Songs between late 1993 and early 1994. The latter was also Gill&#x27;s first solo entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; contrasted &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; favorably against then-labelmate Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot; in a dual review, considering both singers to have emotive vocals and an affinity for mature lyrics. She praised the lyrics of &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; and &quot;No Future in the Past&quot; in particular. AllMusic writer Johnny Loftus considered Gill to have a &quot;smooth&quot; voice, while finding influences of soul music on the title track and of bluegrass music on &quot;No Future in the Past&quot;. &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; won both Best Country Song and Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993, while &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot; was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals a year later. Gill won five CMA Awards in 1993, including Album of the Year, Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and Song of the Year, the last of which went to &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot;.

During promotion for &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; in 1993, Gill also released his first Christmas album &quot;Let There Be Peace on Earth&quot;. The album included a number of traditional Christmas songs as well as a cover of &quot;Let There Be Peace on Earth&quot;, a 1955 gospel song written by Harlene Wood and Sy Miller. Gill&#x27;s rendition featured vocals from his daughter Jenny. Other vocalists on the album included Gene Merlino, Sally Stevens, and Chris Rodriguez. Gill also included the original songs &quot;One Bright Star&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Til the Season Comes Around Again&quot;, and &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be the Same This Year&quot;.

===19941995: &quot;When Love Finds You&quot; and &quot;Souvenirs&quot;===
His next release on MCA was 1994&#x27;s &quot;When Love Finds You&quot;, which would chart a total of six singles between then and 1995. First among these were &quot;Whenever You Come Around&quot; and &quot;What the Cowgirls Do&quot;, both of which peaked at number two. Next were the title track, &quot;Which Bridge to Cross (Which Bridge to Burn)&quot;, and &quot;You Better Think Twice&quot;. All peaked within the top five throughout 1995. The sixth and final single was &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot; at number 14. Jurek thought that &quot;When Love Finds You&quot; was more reliant on ballads than the preceding albums, but praised the lyrical qualities of each, as well as the country rock influence of &quot;You Better Think Twice&quot;. Bill Anderson co-wrote &quot;Which Bridge to Cross&quot;, and attributed renewed interest in his music in the late 1990s to the success of this song. Gill had begun writing &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot; in 1989 as a tribute to Keith Whitley following his death that same year, but did not finish it until four years later when the death of Gill&#x27;s half-brother Bob Cohen inspired him. Patty Loveless and Ricky Skaggs provided backing vocals on the track. Despite its lower chart showing, &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot; remained popular among fans and critics. Dayton Duncan&#x27;s &quot;Country Music: An Illustrated History&quot; (adapted from the Ken Burns documentary &quot;Country Music&quot;) described it as a popular song for fans to commemorate the deaths of family members and friends. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 17 in a list of the 40 Saddest Country Songs. In addition, the song received a platinum certification in 2023. At the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;When Love Finds You&quot; won Best Male Country Vocal Performance and was nominated for Best Country Song; a year later, &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot; would receive both awards. &quot;When Love Finds You&quot; was nominated for Best Country Album during the former ceremony as well.

Gill ended 1995 with a pair of compilation albums. First was &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, a greatest hits album featuring most of his MCA singles to that point as well as selected collaborations. In a review for &quot;The Orange County Register&quot; reprinted in &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Gene Harbrecht thought the compilation showed Gill&#x27;s artistic growth in the intervening years, while also noting its mix of ballads and up-tempo material. At the same time, RCA released &quot;The Essential Vince Gill&quot;, consisting of 20 singles and other songs he had recorded while on that label in the 1980s.

===19961999: &quot;High Lonesome Sound&quot; and &quot;The Key&quot;===

In 1996, MCA released Gill&#x27;s next studio album &quot;High Lonesome Sound&quot;, with its title track also serving as the lead single. This song peaked at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, and went to number one on the Canadian country music charts then published by &quot;RPM&quot;. The album featured two versions of the song: one accompanied by studio musicians, and one accompanied by Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station. Next was the top five hit &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, followed by &quot;Pretty Little Adriana&quot; and &quot;A Little More Love&quot;, which both peaked at number two. Last was &quot;You and You Alone&quot;, a top-ten country hit for him in 1997. Gill was inspired to write &quot;Pretty Little Adriana&quot; after reading a news story about a girl named Adriana Dickerson, who was shot to death outside a Nashville supermarket in 1995. Michael McCall of AllMusic thought individual tracks off &quot;High Lonesome Sound&quot; showed influence of bluegrass, Chicago blues, and Cajun music; he also considered the ballads such as &quot;Pretty Little Adriana&quot; overall the strongest, calling them &quot;more progressively atmospheric&quot; than his previous ballads. Writing for Country Standard Time, Brian Wahlert praised Gill&#x27;s vocals and guitar work, but thought that some songs including &quot;Pretty Little Adriana&quot; and the title track were &quot;trite&quot; and &quot;cliché&quot;. The version of &quot;High Lonesome Sound&quot; featuring Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station won Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, and &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; won Best Male Country Vocal Performance, at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997; one year later, &quot;Pretty Little Adriana&quot; won the latter award as well. Gill continued to tour in 1997, with his tours that year being the fourth most profitable among country artists. Despite this, he canceled a number of dates later in the year to take some time off following the death of his father, Stan.

Gill released two albums in 1998. First was the studio release &quot;The Key&quot;. It was led off by the song &quot;If You Ever Have Forever in Mind&quot;, a top-five country hit. The song won the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. Also released as singles were &quot;Kindly Keep It Country&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Cryin&#x27; to Me&quot;, and &quot;My Kind of Woman/My Kind of Man&quot;. The last of these, a duet with Patty Loveless, also appeared on her 1999 compilation &quot;Classics&quot;. In addition to Loveless, other featured vocalists included Dawn Sears on &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Cryin&#x27; to Me&quot; and Lee Ann Womack on &quot;Kindly Keep It Country&quot;, as well as Alison Krauss, Shelby Lynne, Sonya Isaacs, Faith Hill, and Sara Evans. In turn, Gill sang backing vocals on Hill&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot; and Evans&#x27;s &quot;No Place That Far&quot;, both of which were number-one country songs between late 1998 and early 1999. AllMusic writer Jana Pendragon summarized her review of the album by writing, &quot;For emotional depth, honesty, and the kind of musical depth and artistry listeners have come to expect from Gill, &quot;The Key&quot; stands among his very finest recordings.&quot; &quot;No Depression&quot; writer Grant Alden also reviewed the album with favor, noting that Gill wrote most of the songs by himself; he also described the album&#x27;s sound and lyrics as containing &quot;emotion and elegance&quot;. Later in the year was Gill&#x27;s second Christmas project, &quot;Breath of Heaven: A Christmas Collection&quot;, on which he was accompanied by Patrick Williams and his orchestra. AllMusic reviewer Jana Pendragon praised the album for its orchestral accompaniment, as well as its inclusion of both secular and Christian material. Both &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;Breath of Heaven: A Christmas Collection&quot; were certified platinum.

===20002003: &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;===

In 2000, Gill released the studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye&quot;. The album accounted for three singles in its title track, &quot;Feels Like Love&quot;, and &quot;Shoot Straight from Your Heart&quot;. Of these, &quot;Feels Like Love&quot; was the most successful with a peak of number six on Hot Country Songs. It also accounted for his highest solo Hot 100 peak of number 52. Amy Grant, to whom Gill would become married during the recording of the album, co-wrote and provided duet vocals on the track &quot;When I Look into Your Heart&quot;. Many critics considered the album&#x27;s themes to have been influenced by the then-recent marriage. Jurek noted that the project was dominated by songs about falling in love, but praised Gill&#x27;s lyrics and vocals, as well as Brown&#x27;s production. Nash criticized the sound of the album as &quot;goop&quot; and &quot;tepid&quot; outside the title track. Similarly, in a review for Knight Ridder republished in the &quot;Ventura County Star&quot;, Howard Cohen panned the project for &quot;stock sentiments and imagery&quot; of love and &quot;overly slick balladry&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye&quot; was certified gold after release.

Gill did not issue another studio album until 2003&#x27;s &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;. He wrote its lead single and title track &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; with John Hobbs and former NRBQ member Al Anderson; the song would become Gill&#x27;s last solo top-20 country chart entry upon release. Also released from the album were the less successful singles &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Town&quot;. In a 2003 telephone interview with Country Standard Time, Gill said that many of the lyrics on &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; were inspired by his increasing age and the rise of younger artists who had surpassed him commercially in the intervening years. He also wanted the album to include more humorous material than his previous works. As Brown had stopped working for MCA at the time, this left him unavailable as a producer, so Gill produced the project by himself. Jurek praised the album for including more songs than normal for a country album and having strong production. His review highlighted the singles in particular, additionally noting the contributions of Grant and Michael McDonald. The track &quot;Real Mean Bottle&quot; (inspired by a comment session guitarist Harold Bradley made about Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;The Bottle Let Me Down&quot;) was later covered by Bob Seger on his 2006 album &quot;Face the Promise&quot;. &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance.

===20042007: The Notorious Cherry Bombs and &quot;These Days&quot;===
In 2004, Gill and Rodney Crowell decided to re-establish Crowell&#x27;s former backing band the Cherry Bombs after most of the members had reunited at an awards banquet for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). This lineup included all the former members except for bassist Emory Gordy Jr., who declined to participate, and drummer Larrie Londin, who died of a heart attack in 1992. Their respective roles were taken over by session musicians Michael Rhodes and Eddie Bayers. Crediting themselves as the Notorious Cherry Bombs, this group of musicians recorded one self-titled album for Universal South Records (now Show Dog-Universal Music) in 2004, which featured Gill and Crowell alternating as vocalists. The project charted one single on Hot Country Songs with &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Kiss the Lips at Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day Long&quot;.

Gill&#x27;s next project for MCA was 2006&#x27;s &quot;These Days&quot;, a box set comprising four albums each recorded in a different style. These were &quot;Workin&#x27; on a Big Chill&quot; for country rock, &quot;The Reason Why&quot; for soul music, &quot;Some Things Never Get Old&quot; for neotraditional country, and &quot;Little Brother&quot; for bluegrass music. Among the guest vocalists on the album were Grant, McDonald, Loveless, Crowell, Del McCoury, LeAnn Rimes, Sheryl Crow, Diana Krall, and Trisha Yearwood. Gill co-produced with Justin Niebank and John Hobbs, and wrote most of the songs by himself. Jurek reviewed the project favorably on AllMusic, highlighting the stylistic and lyrical diversity; he concluded his review by stating that the project was &quot;an exhaustive, profound, fun and fulfilling set that not only gives fans something to delight in, but goes wide and if given half a chance could and would attract many new ones.&quot; Scott Jordan of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; panned the songs on &quot;The Reason Why&quot; but compared the tracks on &quot;Workin&#x27; on a Big Chill&quot; favorably to Delbert McClinton and praised the introspective lyrics in some of the tracks on &quot;Little Brother&quot;. The project charted two singles: &quot;The Reason Why&quot; (featuring Alison Krauss) and &quot;What You Give Away&quot; (featuring Sheryl Crow). At the end of 2006, &quot;These Days&quot; was certified platinum. &quot;The Reason Why&quot; won Gill a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007; one year later, &quot;These Days&quot; won Best Country Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.

===20082015: The Time Jumpers, &quot;Guitar Slinger&quot;, and &quot;Bakersfield&quot;===

Despite recording fewer albums throughout the first two decades of the 21st century, Gill remained active as a touring artist. He and Amy Grant accompanied actor, comedian, and musician Steve Martin in May 2009 for his debut on the Grand Ole Opry, which also served as promotion for Martin&#x27;s album &quot;The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo&quot;. In 2010, Gill joined the Time Jumpers, an informal collection of musicians who play bluegrass and Western swing concerts at various venues around Nashville. The ensemble recorded their self-titled second studio album at Gill&#x27;s home studio in 2012. During his tenure in the band, Gill and the Time Jumpers won Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song for the track &quot;Kid Sister&quot; from their 2016 album of the same name. Gill would continue to perform with the Time Jumpers until 2020.

His next solo release was 2011&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Slinger&quot;. The album once again featured songs written or co-written by Gill, along with vocal contributions from Bekka Bramlett, Chris Stapleton, then-former McBride &amp; the Ride member Billy Thomas, and Gill&#x27;s daughter Jenny. Hobbs and Niebank also co-produced with Gill. Grant also provided a duet vocal on the track &quot;True Love&quot;. The project charted one single in &quot;Threaten Me with Heaven&quot;. Jurek thought this track and others on the album had themes of &quot;mortality&quot;, which he considered unusual for Gill&#x27;s work. Additionally, Jurek found influences of rhythm and blues and gospel music among individual tracks. Two years later, Gill collaborated with session steel guitar player Paul Franklin on the cover song project &quot;Bakersfield&quot;. This featured their renditions of songs by Merle Haggard and Buck Owens, two of the main artists known for the Bakersfield sound. Gill and J.T. Corenflos alternated as lead guitarists on the sessions, with other musical contributors including bassist Willie Weeks, drummer Greg Morrow, and backing vocalist Dawn Sears. Both Franklin and Sears had also recorded with Gill in the Time Jumpers. Among the tracks covered were Owens&#x27;s &quot;Together Again&quot; and Haggard&#x27;s &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot;. Jurek thought that the album&#x27;s song choices highlighted the &quot;edgier&quot; nature of the Bakersfield sound, while also speaking favorably of Gill&#x27;s vocals and Franklin&#x27;s playing. Roughstock writer Matt Bjorke also praised the musicianship and song selection, stating that &quot;Mainstream channels may not care much for this kind of music anymore but it&#x27;s still as vibrant and fantastic as it has always been and in the loving hands of Vince Gill and Paul Franklin it shines once again.&quot;

===2016present: &quot;Down to My Last Bad Habit&quot;, membership in Eagles, and &quot;Okie&quot;===
Gill released &quot;Down to My Last Bad Habit&quot; through MCA in 2016. The lead single to the project was &quot;Take Me Down&quot;, featuring guest vocals from Little Big Town. He wrote the song with Richard Marx and Jillian Jacqueline. Cam also contributed vocals to the track &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting for You&quot;. The former was issued as the project&#x27;s lead single. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Gill &quot;maintains an elegant, soulful air throughout the record&quot;, while highlighting the number of guest artists and considering the sound to be influenced by Memphis soul.

Following the death of Eagles member Glenn Frey in 2017, Gill was asked by the remaining band members to replace him. He accepted the offer, as he considered himself a fan of not only the Eagles, but also of Frey&#x27;s solo material. Gill debuted as a member of the band at a concert held in Dodger Stadium in 2017. Both Gill and Frey&#x27;s son Deacon have continued to tour as members of the band throughout the 2010s and 2020s, and plan to continue doing so until the end of the band&#x27;s farewell tour in 2025. Of his membership with the Eagles, Gill stated in an interview with Taste of Country in 2018 that he had a sense of &quot;gratitude&quot; for the other band members choosing him as Frey&#x27;s replacement, but also added, &quot;in my heart of hearts I wish I wasn&#x27;t doing it. That would mean Glenn would still be around, but life is what it is and you just go do what you can do because of what happens. Those songs deserve to live on as long as they can.&quot;

His next release on MCA was 2019&#x27;s &quot;Okie&quot;. Once again, Gill produced with Niebank, in addition to playing guitar alongside Jedd Hughes and Tom Bukovac. According to Taste of Country, Gill conceived the album as more autobiographical than his previous works. The track &quot;Letter to My Mama&quot; was promoted as the first single. The track features Gill playing Dobro. Jurek considered the album &quot;a laid-back collection of original songs that are more poignant and more nakedly autobiographical and topical than anything he&#x27;s previously issued.&quot; The album included a song about Amy Grant titled &quot;When My Amy Prays&quot;, which won Gill the Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance after release.

A second collaborative album with Paul Franklin followed in 2023. Titled &quot;Sweet Memories: The Music of Ray Price &amp; the Cherokee Cowboys&quot;, it features the two covering songs by Ray Price. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, both musicians stated that they wanted to do a second album following &quot;Bakersfield&quot;, and chose Ray Price because both had contributed to some of his later albums.

==Work for other artists==
Gill is known for a large number of collaborative works as a duet partner, session musician, songwriter, and backing vocalist. Of his prolificacy as a collaborative artist, Brown stated in 1998 that Gill often sang harmony for other artists because he enjoyed doing so. One of his first collaborations came in 1987 when Emmylou Harris chose Gill to appear on her album &quot;Angel Band&quot;, a compilation of gospel music standards. Gill played mandolin and sang backing vocals on the project, which also included Emory Gordy Jr. and bluegrass musician Carl Jackson. Alabama recorded one of Gill&#x27;s compositions, &quot;Here We Are&quot;, on their 1990 album &quot;Pass It On Down&quot;. Their version went to number two on the country music charts in 1991. Also in 1991, Mark O&#x27;Connor recorded a cover version of Carl Perkins&#x27;s &quot;Restless&quot; for his album &quot;The New Nashville Cats&quot;. This rendition featured O&#x27;Connor on fiddle, with Gill, Steve Wariner, and Ricky Skaggs alternating on lead vocals and guitar. Credited to Mark O&#x27;Connor &amp; the New Nashville Cats, this rendition went to number 25 on the country charts. All four artists won Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals in 1992 for this song, as well as CMA Vocal Event of the Year. Gill covered the Eagles&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot; for the late-1993 tribute album &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot;, with then-former Eagles member Timothy B. Schmit on backing vocals and Jim Horn on soprano saxophone. While not officially promoted as a single, this cover reached number 42 on Hot Country Songs due to unsolicited airplay. On two occasions, Gill collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel on a cover of a Bob Wills song. The first was &quot;Red Wing&quot; on the 1993 album &quot;Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot;; the second was &quot;Bob&#x27;s Breakdowns&quot; from &quot;Ride with Bob: A Tribute to Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot; six years later. Both collaborations won Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance in their respective years of release. Gill&#x27;s third instrumental Grammy Award win came in 2001 on a rendition of Earl Scruggs&#x27;s &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;, done for the collaboration album &quot;Earl Scruggs and Friends&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Gill was a frequent collaborator of Patty Loveless. He sang backing vocals on her 1987 self-titled debut album, and also on her 1989 hit &quot;Timber, I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;. Additionally, she did likewise on several of his singles, including &quot;When I Call Your Name&quot;, &quot;Pocket Full of Gold&quot;, and &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot;. In 1994, Gill contributed to two collaborations. First was &quot;House of Love&quot;, a duet with Amy Grant from her album of the same name. The song was a top-40 hit on the Hot 100 after its release. Gill&#x27;s other collaboration in 1994 was on &quot;Kermit Unpigged&quot;, an album released by Jim Henson performing in-character as the Muppets alongside a number of musical guests. On this album, Gill and Henson in-character as Kermit the Frog recorded a cover of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot;; this cover reached number 65 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country charts. A year later, Gill sang a duet with Dolly Parton on a re-recording of her hit &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; on her album &quot;Something Special&quot;. Gill had originally wanted to wait until after &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot; to release the duet version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. However, demand from radio caused the duet to chart prematurely and ascend the charts simultaneously with &quot;Go Rest High on That Mountain&quot;, and Gill chose not to intervene. Gill co-wrote and provided backing vocals on the track &quot;You Just Get One&quot;, recorded in 1995 by Ty Herndon on his debut album &quot;What Mattered Most&quot;. Jeff Wood later released a version of the song in 1997, which featured Gill on both lead guitar and mandolin. Also in 1997, both Gill and Alison Krauss were credited for their backing vocals on Mark Chesnutt&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;; the three had originally recorded it in 1992 for Chesnutt&#x27;s album &quot;Longnecks &amp; Short Stories&quot;, but Chesnutt chose to include it on his 1997 album &quot;Thank God for Believers&quot; and release it as a single as he thought the song still had potential as a single. In 1998, Gill won another Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance, as a featured performer on Randy Scruggs&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Joy&quot; from his album &quot;Crown of Jewels&quot;. A year later, he sang duet vocals on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;If You Ever Leave Me&quot;.

Gill and Sheryl Crow were both credited for their backing vocals on Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Building Bridges&quot;, a top-five country hit in 2006. Brad Paisley&#x27;s 2008 instrumental album &quot;&quot; featured Gill as one of several instrumentalists on the track &quot;Cluster Pluck&quot;, which accounted for Gill&#x27;s fourth Grammy win in the category of Best Country Instrumental Performance. Gill was featured on Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s 2012 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush&quot; as well. A year later he co-produced Ashley Monroe&#x27;s album &quot;Like a Rose&quot; and co-wrote two songs on it. The two toured with Charlie Worsham in 2015. Between late 2016 and early 2017, Gill was credited for his backing vocals and lead guitar on Chris Young&#x27;s &quot;Sober Saturday Night&quot;, which also went to number one on the country charts. Gill also charted in 2017 as a guest vocalist on Maren Morris&#x27;s promotional single &quot;Dear Hate&quot;, written in response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The song was Gill&#x27;s 65th entry on the country charts.

Three notable multi-artist collaborations have featured Gill as a performer. First was &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, a charity single written by Kix Brooks and Pam Tillis featuring over 20 country music singers, and released by Warner Records to honor the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. In 1996, he participated in &quot;Hope: Country Music&#x27;s Quest for a Cure&quot;, a charity single by the T.J. Martell Foundation to honor cancer and leukemia research. He also participated in the 2016 collaboration &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a medley of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;Country Roads, Take Me Home&quot; recorded by 30 country artists to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Country Music Association. This collaboration went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts under the credit &quot;Artists of Then, Now, and Forever&quot;.

==Musical style==
Gill&#x27;s music is defined by his tenor voice, guitar playing, and breadth of influences. The editors of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; wrote of Gill, &quot;With an aching tenor, award-winning songwriting skills, and virtuoso guitar chops that rivals those of any ace Nashville session player, Vince Gill is one of today&#x27;s biggest country superstars.&quot; His vocal style has also been noted for its bluegrass music phrasing. Steve Huey of AllMusic describes Gill as &quot;one of the most respected musicians in the history of country music&quot;. He characterizes Gill&#x27;s early work as influential in the neotraditional country movements of the late 1980s to early 1990s, but thought his membership in both Pure Prairie League and the Eagles showed an interest in his music outside of country music as well. Sarah Rodman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to Gill as &quot;the Oklahoma native with the tenor kissed by angels and the guitar prowess of a man who made a deal with the devil&quot; and stated that he &quot;rose to become one of the most respected names in country music, often serving as a link between the classic artists that preceded him and the generation of stars that have followed in his footsteps.&quot; Jeffrey B. Remz, writing for Country Standard Time, stated that Gill &quot;was a fine singer with his sturdy tenor, and his guitar playing has always been considered top notch. A heavy touring schedule resulted from his success with concerts sometimes going on for three hours. He was not a paint-by-the-numbers kind of country performer.&quot; Joe Bosso of &quot;Guitar World&quot; describes Gill as having &quot;virtuosic and sweetly expressive solos&quot; in both flatpicking and fingerstyle guitar; in the same article, Gill himself stated that he &quot;play[s] what&#x27;s necessary&quot;. Of his guitar playing, Jo Sgammato stated that his playing lead guitar while also being a vocalist was uncommon among country music artists; she also noted that critics had compared his style to Eric Clapton and Chet Atkins.

Gill cites Merle Haggard as one of his main influences. In 2003, he stated in an interview with Country Standard Time, &quot;he&#x27;s the greatest singer, the greatest phraser, and then on top of that, his songs are really poetic.&quot; He has also named female artists he grew up on, such as Patsy Cline and Kitty Wells, as influences. Outside of country, Gill has also named Bruce Springsteen and John Fogerty as influences, as he considered their works to have &quot;honesty&quot;. Gill said that he characterized his own songwriting by &quot;simplicity&quot;, a characteristic he also thought was present in the works of Hank Williams. Jo Sgammato also noted in &quot;The Vince Gill Story&quot; that Gill&#x27;s albums had a higher number of songs written by him than his contemporaries did. She also thought the track &quot;Nothing Like a Woman&quot; from &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; had a Motown influence due to Gill&#x27;s &quot;high, wailing chorus&quot;, while comparing both &quot;Say Hello&quot; from the same album and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Cryin&#x27; to Me&quot; from &quot;The Key&quot; to the Bakersfield sound. Additionally, Sgammato observed that Gill tended to have hits with ballads more frequently than with up-tempo material, although she cited &quot;Liza Jane&quot; and &quot;One More Last Chance&quot; as successful examples of the latter.

Gill has also been named as an influence by other artists. Jason Sellers played bass guitar in Gill&#x27;s road band in the late 1990s, and consulted Gill a number of times for career advice prior to singing with BNA Records in 1997. In a review of his debut album, Jeff Davis of Country Standard Time thought that Sellers idolized Gill and was &quot;imitative&quot; of him. In turn, Sellers filled in for Gill on a number of live performances of &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush&quot; where Gill was unavailable. Country and bluegrass singer Charlie Worsham has named Gill as an influence, and claimed that &quot;Liza Jane&quot; was one of the first songs he learned to play on guitar. In 2018, Gill gave Worsham a custom-made guitar, which Worsham played on his second album &quot;Beginning of Things&quot;.

==Personal life==
In April 1980, Gill married singer Janis Oliver, who would join her sister Kristine in the country duo Sweethearts of the Rodeo later in the decade. Gill wrote both &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;The Radio&quot; about his relationship to her. The two divorced in 1997, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple had one daughter, Jenifer &quot;Jenny&quot; Gill, of whom Janis assumed custody following their divorce. Jenny has contributed to her father&#x27;s albums on a number of occasions, including &quot;Let There Be Peace on Earth&quot;. Steve Huey, writing for AllMusic, noted that many critics thought songs from &quot;The Key&quot; were influenced by the divorce from Oliver. Gill began dating contemporary Christian music singer Amy Grant in 1999 following her divorce from singer Gary Chapman. The two married on March 10, 2000. AllMusic writer Thom Jurek thought that certain tracks on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye&quot; were inspired by his marriage to Grant, which occurred during the recording of that album. One year after their marriage, in March 2001, the couple had a daughter, named Corrinna. In 2023, Corrinna Gill began releasing her own music online.

Gill is known for his pleasant demeanor and frequent involvements in charity works, leading many publications to refer to him as the &quot;nicest guy in Nashville&quot;. In an article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; republished in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, journalist Richard Harrington described Gill as &quot;perpetually affable, easily approachable, [and] ego-deficient.&quot; Gill enjoys golf and in 1993 started a golf charity known as the Vinny Pro-Celebrity Golf Invitational, which raises money for children&#x27;s golf in the state of Tennessee. Gill received a 2003 Distinguished Service Award from Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America to honor this charity. In 1995, Gill held a concert to benefit the American Red Cross following the Oklahoma City bombing. Overall, Gill is credited with contributing to over 60 charities, including All for the Hall, an annual benefit concert for the Country Music Hall of Fame.

<text>Meixian District () is a district of Meizhou City, in northeastern Guangdong Province, China. The district is an important Hakka settlement and is the ancestral home of many Hakka descendants living in Taiwan and other countries worldwide.

== History ==
Its original name was Chengxiang county () during the southern Han Dynasty where it was first created, all the way to the Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, and then renamed Jiaying county during the Qing dynasty. It only obtained the name Meixian in 1911 during the Xinhai Revolution.

== Geography ==

Meixian almost completely surrounds Meizhou&#x27;s central urban Meijiang District. This is due to the old urban core of Meixian becoming separated from the bulk of the county in the territorial reorganization following the 1949 establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, when it was given equal status.

==Ethno-linguistic make-up==

Meixian is noted for its large Hakka population.

== Administrative divisions ==
Meixian has administrative jurisdiction over one subdistrict and 18 towns.

; Subdistrict:
* Xincheng ()

; Towns:
*Chendong () 
*Shisan () 
*Meixi ()
*Daping ()
*Shikeng () 
*Shuiche ()
*Meinan () 
*Bincun () 
*Baidu () 
*Songyuan () 
*Longwen () 
*Taoyao ()
*Shejiang () 
*Yanyang ()
*Songkou () 
*Nankou ()
*Chengjiang () 
*Fuda ()

== Culture ==
With a majority Hakka population, Meixian, along with Dabu County, is known as the home of Standard Hakka.

<text>The Patrons of Industry in Canada were based on the Patrons of Industry of Michigan that had formed in 1889. It was dedicated to upholding and encouraging the moral, social, intellectual, political and financial situation of farmers and to preserve the way of life that existed in farming communities in the late nineteenth century against encroaching industrialization. It cooperated with the urban labour movement to address the political frustrations of both groups with big business.

The Patrons&#x27; first appearance in Canada was The Grand Association of the Patrons of Industry in Ontario, founded in 1890. It declared itself independent of the U.S. group in 1891.

Although centred in Ontario, the organization branched out into Manitoba (see Patrons of Industry in Manitoba), Alberta, Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The Patrons&#x27; membership exceeded 30,000 at its peak.

In the Maritimes, the Patrons of industry had some successes but soon collapsed. In the 1895 New Brunswick general election, two Patrons of Industry MLAs were elected.
Duncan Marshall in 1895 established more than eighty lodges in Prince Edward Island alone. He also edited a Charlottetown weekly newspaper &quot;The Patron of Industry&quot;. He contested a by-election in 1896 but the organization was unable to break into the established two-party alignment in the province and was soundly defeated. Marshal left the province soon after the election (and would go on to be a cabinet minister in Alberta and in Ontario), and the movement in the region collapsed.

The Patrons ran candidates in the 1894 Ontario provincial election. Three Patrons of Industry candidates were elected, and 13 other members of the Legislative Assembly were elected with Patrons of Industry support — 12 Liberals and one Conservative.

The Patrons of Industry ran 31 candidates (including three in Manitoba and one in Quebec) in the 1896 federal election (see below). Several, including David Dickson Rogers, William Varney Pettet, John Tolmie and Douglas Moffat, were elected, Rogers by acclamation.

The party was soon divided on the question of cooperation with the Ontario Liberal Party, and the group was virtually extinct by 1900. Both Rogers and Pettet ran for re-election in the 1900 federal election but not under the Patrons banner.

The party achieved a few gains for farmers, such as institution of a cooling-off period to ban Ontario defeated politicians from holding office in government for one year after defeat and a cut in tariffs effected in 1894.

<doc id="480747" wikidata="Q1786960" url="?curid=480747" title="Oostvaardersplassen">
<text>The Oostvaardersplassen () is a nature reserve in the Netherlands, managed by the &quot;Staatsbosbeheer&quot; (state forestry service). Covering about in the province of Flevoland, it is an experiment in rewilding. It is in a polder created in 1968; by 1989, its ecological interest had resulted in its being declared a Ramsar wetland. It became part of Nieuw Land National Park when that was established in 2018.

== Geography ==
The Oostvaardersplassen is located in the municipality of Lelystad, between the towns of Lelystad and Almere, in the province of Flevoland in the Netherlands. The area of is situated on the shore of the Markermeer in the center of the Flevopolder. The Oostvaardersplassen can be divided into a wet area in the northwest and a dry area in the southeast.

== Wet and dry areas ==
In the wet area along the Markermeer, there are large reedbeds on clay, where greylag geese often feed. Oostvaardersplassen is also a Special Protection Area for birdlife such as the great cormorant, common spoonbill, great egret, white-tailed eagle, Eurasian bittern, common kingfisher, grey heron, common raven, barnacle goose, little egret, Savi&#x27;s warbler, and bearded reedling, among many other animals such as the European red fox, and &quot;Nicrophorus vespillo&quot; burying beetle.

Before the establishment of the reserve, the dry area was a nursery for willow trees, and in the first year hundreds of seedlings could be found on each square metre. This led to concern that a dense woodland would develop, significantly reducing the value of the habitat for water birds. To avoid this, the park&#x27;s managers brought in a number of large herbivores to keep the area more open, including Konik horses, red deer and Heck cattle. These large grazing animals are kept out in the open all year round without supplemental feeding for the winter and early spring, and are allowed to behave as wild animals (without, for example, for now, castrating males). The ecosystem developing under their influence is thought to resemble those that would have existed on European river banks and deltas before human disturbance. However, there is some controversy about how natural the ecosystem is because it is a fenced in area with limited space, there are currently no wildlife corridors to connect the reserve to other places, it has a pumping station to control and prevent floods, and the area lacks large predators to keep the large numbers of herbivores in check such as the Eurasian wolf, Eurasian brown bear and Eurasian lynx.

== Large herbivores ==

Before they were driven to extinction, large herbivores in this part of Europe included the tarpan (wild horse), wisent (European bison), red deer and aurochs (wild cattle). The tarpan and aurochs are extinct, but Konik ponies and Heck cattle are able to act as functional equivalents, occupying a similar ecological niche. The only native large herbivores now missing from Oostvaardersplassen are the elk (&quot;Alces alces)&quot;, the roe deer &quot;formerly present in the park&quot;, the wild boar and the wisent. There is a chance that the wild boar will find its way naturally from the Veluwe.

=== Management ===
The reserve is the subject of decades of management reports and protests against the large reported number of grazers dying by starvation or shot to death, while the animals are kept behind a fence and cannot migrate. 
During a particularly harsh winter in 2005, many animals in the Oostvaardersplassen died of starvation, leading to public outcry against alleged animal cruelty and leading to the culling strategy. In the winter of 2017–2018, almost 3.300 deer, horses and cattle starved to death dividing the Dutch public and leading to demonstrations and individuals feeding hay to the animals despite police arrests.

The Province asked the Van Geel Commission to write a policy which was presented in April and approved on 11 July 2018. This Van Geel report advised to manage the terrain instead of rewilding. The consequence is a reduction of the numbers of remaining animals either by replacing or shooting which led to another outburst of protests and court cases.

Mass mortalities were likely also caused by failure to connect the reserve to the Veluwe nearby due to conflicts with farmers and a lack of political support, abandonment of due to political transition, and failure to introduce large predators.

== Future development ==
In many ways the Oostvaardersplassen is an isolated area; it is in a polder and there are currently no corridors connecting it to other nature reserves. The &quot;Ecological Main Structure&quot; plan proposes connections between nature reserves in the Netherlands, calling for a corridor to be created toward nearby . The resulting network, called &quot;Oostvaardersland&quot;, would be part of Natura 2000, the European-wide network of habitats to which Oostvaardersplassen belongs. The creation of Oostvaardersland will allow seasonal small scale migration and take some strain off the big grazers in winter. In the summer, Oostvaardersplassen will offer rich grazing and the sea winds will keep biting insects at bay, in the winter, the Horsterwold will offer protection from cold winds and supply browse. Oostvaardersland will comprise a total area of . Furthermore, there is an option for a connection to the Veluwe forest. Eventually this could allow wild animals to move to and from Germany.

Oostvaardersland was expected to be finished by 2014. However, the project ran into financial and political troubles. In 2012 the creation of , the 7 × 1 mi connecting corridor between Oostvaardersplassen and the Horsterwold, was stopped, and four members of the regional parliament resigned. The government then planned to sell back the property to the previous owners for less money than it originally paid for the property; according to European nature laws it would then have to turn other lands into wilderness areas to compensate for the loss of the Oostvaarderswold nature area. 

As above-mentioned, the plan to connect to the veluwe in Gelderland also failed.

<text>A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.

Originally, clockmakers were master craftsmen who designed and built clocks by hand. Since modern clockmakers are required to repair antique, handmade or one-of-a-kind clocks for which parts are not available, they must have some of the design and fabrication abilities of the original craftsmen. A qualified clockmaker can typically design and make a missing piece for a clock without access to the original component.

Clockmakers generally do not work on watches; the skills and tools required are different enough that watchmaking is a separate field, handled by another specialist, the watchmaker.

==Origins and specialities==
The earliest use of the term &quot;clokkemaker&quot; is said to date from 1390, about a century after the first mechanical clocks appeared. From the beginning in the 15th century through the 17th century, clockmaking was considered the &quot;leading edge&quot;, most technically advanced trade existing. Historically, the best clockmakers often also built scientific instruments, as for a long time they were the only craftsmen around trained in designing precision mechanical apparatus. In one example, the harmonica was invented by a young German clockmaker, which was then mass-produced by another clockmaker, Matthias Hohner.

Prior to 1800 clocks were entirely handmade, including all their parts, in a single shop under a master clockmaker. Examples of these complex movements can be seen in the many longcase clocks constructed in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the 19th century, clock parts were beginning to be made in small factories, but the skilled work of designing, assembling, and adjusting the clock was still done by clockmaking shops. By the 20th century, interchangeable parts and standardized designs allowed the entire clock to be assembled in factories, and clockmakers specialized in repair of clocks.

In Germany, Nuremberg and Augsburg were the early clockmaking centers, and the Black Forest came to specialize in wooden cuckoo clocks.

==Guilds==
As the art of making clocks became more widespread and distinguished, guilds specifically for this trade emerged around the sixteenth century. One of the first guilds developed in London, England, known as the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers; the group formed after a small number of foreign-trained clockmakers spent time working in London. A requirement of joining the guild was to practise their craft and gain as much experience as possible, along with joining one of many other trade guilds, such as the Blacksmiths, Stationers, or Drapers Company. There are many guilds where clockmakers meet to buy, sell and get clocks to repair from customers, the IWJG is one of the most prominent in the world.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of consumerism in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London. However, by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition. Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of Huguenot craftsmen, and in the 19th century the Swiss industry &quot;gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches&quot;. The leading firm of the day was Patek Philippe founded by Antoni Patek of Warsaw and Adrien Philippe of Bern.

==Tools==
Early clockmakers fashioned all the intricate parts and wheelwork of clocks by hand, using hand tools. They developed specialized tools to help them.

* Balance Truing Caliper: This device was used in fashioning the wheels and gearwork of the clock, to make sure the wheel, particularly the balance wheel was balanced and circular. The pivots of the wheel were mounted in the caliper. An index arm was moved next to the edge and the wheel was spun to see if the edge was true.
* Die/Screw Plate: The die plate was used to cut threads on small screws. It had a number of threaded die holes of different sizes for making different threads. A piece of wire was inserted in a hole and turned to cut a thread on the end. Then a head would be formed on the other end of the wire to make a screw.
* File: Hardened steel files were used to shape the metal before it was used to make and fit wheels or plates. There were many variations of files.
* Rivet Extracting Pliers: Made of brass or steel, rivet extracting pliers were used to remove rivets from assorted clock parts.
* Jeweler’s Piercing Saw: The blade of the saw was released by undoing the thumbscrew adjacent to the handle. To start an interior cut, a hole was drilled and the blade was inserted and reattached to the saw. This device was popular among clockmakers to repair the ends of clock hands.
* Staking tool: An iron vertical plunger was used with an array of stakes for placing rollers and balanced wheels on staffs.
* Turns: The &quot;turns&quot; was a small bow-operated lathe used for furbishing parts and for working gear blanks to size. During use, the device was clamped in a vise and the worker held a cutting or polishing tool on a tee-shaped tool rest with one hand, and shifted the bow back and forth to spin the part.
* Cross Peen Riveting Hammer: The flat end of the tool was for general use, whereas the radiused peen end was used for flattening rivet heads. This tool was used for forging, riveting, striking steel, etc.

==Other uses==

&quot;Clockmaker&quot; is also the name of several movies.

Deists often call God the &quot;Clockmaker&quot;. The Temple of the Great Clockmaker, in the novel &quot;The Case Of The Dead Certainty&quot; by Kel Richards, is a temple which represents deism.

The Clock Maker Theory and the watchmaker analogy describe by way of analogy religious, philosophical, and theological opinions about the existence of god(s) that have been expressed over the years.

During the 1800s and 1900s, clocks or watches were carried around as a form of flaunting social status. They were also a way of instilling a sense of time regulation for work in the budding industrial market.

In 2004, Jim Krueger wrote a comic book entitled &quot;The Clock Maker&quot;, published by German publisher Image Publishing, that focuses on the life of a clockmaker.

Artist Tony Troy creates the Illustration titled &quot;The Clockmaker&quot; in 2003 for his Broadway musical &quot;The Fluteplayer&#x27;s Song&quot;.

<text>Spencer Woolley Kimball (March 28, 1895 – November 5, 1985) was an American religious leader who was the twelfth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

The grandson of early Latter-day Saint apostle Heber C. Kimball, Kimball was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He spent most of his early life in Thatcher, Arizona, where his father, Andrew Kimball, farmed and served as the area&#x27;s stake president. He served an LDS mission in Independence, Missouri, from 1914 to 1916, then worked for various banks in Arizona&#x27;s Gila Valley as a clerk and bank teller. Kimball later co-founded a business selling bonds and insurance that, after weathering the Great Depression, became highly successful. Kimball served as a stake president in his hometown from 1938 until 1943, when he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Like most other LDS Church apostles, Kimball traveled extensively to fulfill a wide variety of administrative and ecclesiastical duties. Early in his time as an apostle, Kimball was directed by church president George Albert Smith to spend extra time in religious and humanitarian work with Native Americans, which Kimball did throughout his life. He initiated the Indian Placement Program, which helped many Native American students gain education in the 1960s and 1970s while they stayed with LDS foster families.

In late 1973, following the sudden death of Harold B. Lee, Kimball became the LDS Church&#x27;s twelfth president, a position he held until his death in 1985. Kimball&#x27;s presidency was noted for the 1978 announcement ending the restriction on church members of black African descent being ordained to the priesthood or receiving temple ordinances. Kimball&#x27;s presidency saw large growth in the LDS Church, both in terms of membership and the number of temples. Kimball was the first church president to state publicly that the church expects all able-bodied male members to serve missions in young adulthood, resulting in an increase in missionary service.

==Ancestry==
Kimball&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Heber C. Kimball, was one of the original LDS apostles who were called when Joseph Smith first organized the Quorum of the Twelve in February 1835. Kimball later served as first counselor to Brigham Young in the church&#x27;s First Presidency from 1847 until his death in 1868.

Kimball&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Edwin D. Woolley, was a prominent LDS bishop in Salt Lake City for many years.

== Early life (1895–1916) ==
Kimball was born on March 28, 1895, in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to Andrew Kimball and Olive Woolley. He had ten siblings. In 1898, when Kimball was three years old, his father was called as president of the St. Joseph Arizona Stake, and his family relocated to the town of Thatcher, in Southeastern Arizona&#x27;s Graham County.

During his childhood, Kimball had a number of medical problems, including typhoid fever and facial paralysis (likely Bell&#x27;s palsy), and he once nearly drowned. Four of his sisters died in childhood, and his mother died when he was eleven. Though only tall as an adult, Kimball was an avid basketball player, and he was the star and leading scorer on most of his school and recreational teams. In addition to being an athlete, Kimball was an honor student at the LDS Gila Academy (modern Eastern Arizona College). During summer holidays, he often worked at a dairy in Globe, Arizona, milking cows, cleaning stalls, and washing bottles for $50 to $60 per month as well as room and board.

Kimball graduated from high school in May 1914 and, one week later, was called to serve as a missionary in the Swiss–German Mission. Less than two months later, his European mission call was cut short by the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and the subsequent outbreak of World War I. Kimball was reassigned to the Central States Mission and spent most of the rest of his mission in the towns and rural settlements of Missouri until 1916.

==Marriage and early career (1917–1925)==

Hoping to become a schoolteacher, Kimball spent one semester at the University of Arizona in the spring of 1917, but he received an army draft notice later that year. During that time, he courted Camilla Eyring (1894–1987), a schoolteacher at Gila Academy, where Kimball had attended high school. They began dating in August 1917 and exchanged letters regularly after Kimball left for a semester at Brigham Young University (BYU) the next month. After one month at BYU, Kimball was notified that his call into the army was imminent, and he had to leave the university and return to his hometown. He returned to Arizona, but his army group was never called for duty before World War I ended with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

Kimball and Eyring&#x27;s relationship deepened quickly, and by late October, they had decided to marry. Because of their employment commitments and lack of money, the couple could not afford to travel to Utah to marry in the nearest LDS temple. They were married in a civil ceremony in Camilla&#x27;s home in Pima, Arizona, on November 16, 1917. Seven months later, the couple made the two-day journey by train to Salt Lake City where they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on June 7, 1918. They eventually had four children: Spencer L. &quot;Spence&quot; (1918–2003), Olive Beth &quot;Bobby&quot; (1922–2018), Andrew E. (1927–2020), and Edward L. &quot;Ed&quot; (1930–2016).

In 1921, Kimball began work at the Thatcher branch of the Arizona Trust and Savings Bank, where he was eventually promoted to assistant cashier at $225 per month, a high salary at the time. The bank failed in 1923 in the aftermath of the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank. Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including playing the piano and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal laxative company, and clerical work for local stores.

Shortly after Kimball married, his father called him to serve as clerk for the St. Joseph Stake. In the 1920s, local stake clerks still performed the extensive record-keeping and reporting duties that are now digitized and done centrally at the LDS Church&#x27;s headquarters in Salt Lake City. The position of stake clerk was essentially a part-time job, and those called were paid a monthly salary of $50.

==Career and stake presidency (1925–1943)==
In 1925, Kimball and Joseph W. Greenhalgh, a Latter-day Saint businessman who served as a bishop in a local ward, began a small securities business making and purchasing loans from local businesses and individuals. By 1927, the business became independent, and after investing $150 of his own money in the business, Kimball began running it full-time in Safford, Arizona, as the Kimball–Greenhalgh Agency, dealing in local insurance, real estate, debt collection, and bonds. The business suffered greatly during the Great Depression and lost much of its capital between 1930 and 1933. Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the Great Depression and became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball&#x27;s initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.

Kimball was active in many civic organizations, including the Parent-Teacher Association, city council, Red Cross, Boy Scouts, and he was elected leader of the Arizona Rotary Club in 1936. Kimball had achieved record success in organizing new Rotary Club chapters, and the Arizona membership voted to pay for him and his wife to travel to the club&#x27;s 1936 international convention in Nice, France. They went by train to Chicago and then to Montreal, where their oldest son, Spencer L., was serving as an LDS missionary. They traveled on a week-long passage on an ocean liner to Le Havre. From there, they visited Paris, Monte Carlo, Genoa, Rome, Pompeii, Florence, Venice, Vienna, the Swiss Alps, Belgium, the Netherlands, and London.

In February 1938, LDS apostle Melvin J. Ballard was sent to Thatcher to divide the growing St. Joseph Stake. The newly created Mount Graham Stake covered the eastern half of the old stake, and Kimball was called as its first stake president. Though smaller than the previous stake, the newly formed stake covered a large area that extended east as far as El Paso, Texas. For Kimball and his two counselors to visit each ward in the stake required traveling a total of . During the Mount Graham Stake&#x27;s semiannual stake conference in September 1941, unusually heavy rains caused the Gila River to overflow its banks, flooding several of the towns in the stake and causing $100,000 in damage to the farms and buildings of Latter-day Saints in the area. As stake president, Kimball coordinated the LDS Church&#x27;s humanitarian response, which quickly mobilized funds, materials, and manpower to care for displaced residents and begin recovery.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the subsequent entry of the United States into World War II, a number of young men from the stake left to join the US military. At one point, 250 men from the stake served in the war, and Kimball ensured that every one received a copy of the monthly stake bulletin and often wrote personal notes on each copy to the recipient.

Kimball was widely known and respected in the community, and he was constantly stopped on the streets of Safford by acquaintances and friends asking for his advice. After he was called to serve as stake president, non-Mormon residents and travelers in Safford often asked Kimball to perform marriages for them. Kimball&#x27;s demanding schedule of managing the Kimball–Greenhalgh Agency, serving in civic organizations, and serving in LDS Church leadership positions as well as making time for his wife and children took mental and physical tolls on his body. His journals from the 1930s and early 1940s often mention his exhaustion from days that were spent working 16 hours or more: &quot;Am on a tension from 7 a.m. till 11 p.m. every single minute every day. I know I&#x27;m working too hard but there seems no place to stop.&quot;

==Apostolic ministry (1943–1973)==
===Calling===
The deaths of Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two vacancies in the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received a telephone call from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark&#x27;s permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball&#x27;s desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum&#x27;s seniority.

In accordance with church requirements and tradition, the Kimballs immediately began the transition from Arizona to Salt Lake City upon Kimball&#x27;s call to be an apostle. Kimball sold his share in the Kimball–Greenhalgh Agency for $65,000 and sold their home and all their other property in Arizona. Kimball was particularly saddened to leave his local Rotary Club chapter and his other professional associations; Camilla worried about leaving her elderly parents in Arizona and relocating their second son, Andrew, who had just been elected senior class president at Safford High School.

=== World War II ===
Kimball&#x27;s first years as an apostle were dominated by World War II. Kimball often encouraged American church members to purchase war bonds to support the war effort, which they would then be able to cash out after the war and use the accumulated interest to send returned soldiers on LDS missions. Kimball lamented the global destruction of World War II and once wrote in his journal, &quot;How outraged the Lord must feel to see His children fighting down here like wild beasts.&quot; As the keynote speaker at BYU&#x27;s 1944 baccalaureate service, Kimball publicly criticized members of Allied nations for concentrating on &quot;the tyranny and shackles of [other] nations and at the same time [remaining] in bondage individually to sin.&quot;

As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball and other LDS Church leaders constantly responded to the needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball&#x27;s eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Franklin&quot;, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God&#x27;s all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.

=== Native Americans ===

In May 1945, shortly after becoming church president, George Albert Smith instructed Kimball, &quot;I want you to look after the Indians—they are neglected. Take charge and watch after the Indians in all the world.&quot; Kimball saw the assignment as fulfillment of a prophecy given in the patriarchal blessing he received as an eight-year-old in 1903, which had stated that Kimball would &quot;preach the Gospel to many people, but more especially to the Lamanites.&quot; That term refers to a people in the Book of Mormon believed by Latter-day Saints to be among the ancestors of modern Native Americans; another term was Nephites. In September 1946, George Albert Smith again gave Kimball the charge to watch over the interests of the indigenous people of the Americas. At this time Smith explicitly included the indigenous peoples of the Pacific islands.

In October 1946, Kimball and several other general authorities toured the Navajo Nation in an effort to improve relations between the LDS Church and the Navajo people. Kimball was dismayed at the abject poverty among the Navajo and empathized with their distrust of the US government. At that time, the average Navajo person ate no more than a day, and a single dentist served the entire population of 55,000. Though the reservation of the Navajo Nation covered , only 0.01% of that area was arable. In 1947, Golden Buchanan, an LDS leader in Sevier County, Utah, heard of a 17-year-old Navajo girl working on a sugar beet farm who wanted to stay in Utah and attend public school. Buchanan wrote Kimball with an idea for the children of Navajo families to live with local LDS families so that they could receive proper nutrition and educations. Kimball supported the idea and asked Buchanan if his family would be willing to take Helen John, the Navajo girl, as a foster daughter to begin the program. Buchanan&#x27;s family agreed. While it took time to develop the program, that is referred to as the start of the LDS Church&#x27;s Indian Placement Program, also known as the &quot;Lamanites Placement Program&quot;. By 1954, the program had 68 students, and the church had standardized some of its approach. By 1969, nearly 5,000 students were placed with LDS families throughout the Western United States and Canada.

Kimball was particularly distressed by the racism against Native Americans that was still widespread among white church members in the 1940s and 1950s. At the LDS Church&#x27;s April 1954 general conference, Kimball openly denounced the prevalent prejudices against non-whites and compared such church members to the Pharisees who mistreated Jesus Christ and the priest and Levite from the parable of the Good Samaritan. Kimball subsequently repeated his warning at a BYU campus devotional, stating that there were &quot;too many Pharisees among the white [students and faculty]... too many Levites who pull their robes about them and pass by with disdain.&quot;

===Individual counseling===
When not touring missions or presiding over weekend stake conferences, Kimball spent weekdays answering correspondences at his home or working in his office at LDS Church headquarters in Salt Lake City. Kimball was noted among the apostles for his willingness to meet with church members struggling with serious personal problems, particularly married couples considering divorce or individuals wishing to confess serious violations of the LDS Church&#x27;s law of chastity, which prohibits sexual relations outside of marriage. During his time as an apostle, Kimball met with thousands of church members and full-time missionaries who, for various reasons, felt their own local church leaders could not help them. Kimball &quot;had no patience for sin [but] almost infinite patience for sinners&quot; and often spent long hours with individuals in great distress. In 1959, Kimball and fellow apostle Mark E. Petersen were assigned to counsel church members dealing with homosexuality, which Kimball believed could, &quot;like all other problems&quot;, be overcome through &quot;consistent prayerful exercise of self-restraint&quot;. Kimball&#x27;s experiences impelled his writing of &quot;The Miracle of Forgiveness&quot;, first published in 1969, which dealt with the serious nature of LDS standards on sexual morality and counseled church members on repentance and avoidance of such problems.

=== Health challenges ===
Beginning in 1932, Kimball suffered from boils and infectious sores, which plagued him until the advent of antibacterial medicines such as sulfonamides and penicillin during World War II.

In May 1948, while he was holding church meetings throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish throughout the rest of the trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family&#x27;s finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting at the Navajo Nation. At his physician&#x27;s urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight. Kimball&#x27;s chest pains recurred occasionally throughout the next several years, particularly in times of greatest stress or fatigue.
In early 1950, when he was 55, Kimball, who had never smoked or used tobacco, began experiencing persistent hoarseness and after a physical examination, he underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball&#x27;s hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding in the back of his throat. Kimball&#x27;s physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (1892–1977), an expert on cancers of the head and neck. Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated &quot;borderline malignancy&quot;, and in early 1957, Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy. At the time, the biopsy itself could cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle, he should have sought McKay&#x27;s approval before he underwent surgical procedures that could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties.

McKay stated that he believed Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him to go forward with the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball&#x27;s vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, his physician allowed him to resume speaking in public. Kimball&#x27;s voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.

In early 1972, when he was 77, Kimball began experiencing difficulty breathing, excessive fatigue, and sleeplessness. Medical examinations discovered serious aortic calcification and some coronary artery disease. Meanwhile, Kimball had experienced a recurrence of his earlier throat cancer. He arranged a meeting between his physicians, cardiologist Ernest L. Wilkinson and cardiothoracic surgeon Russell M. Nelson (a future LDS Church president), and the church&#x27;s First Presidency. Nelson later described the meeting:

Kimball&#x27;s heart surgery was postponed for him to undergo radiation therapy on his throat, which was successful. Immediately following the conclusion of the LDS Church&#x27;s April 1972 general conference, Kimball successfully underwent a 4.5 hour open-heart surgery that was performed by Nelson. Kimball spent the next several months recovering.

==Church presidency (1973–1985)==

Given Kimball&#x27;s history of health problems, many peopleincluding Kimball himselfdid not anticipate him living long enough to become president of the LDS Church. However, on December 26, 1973, Harold B. Lee, who was four years younger than Kimball and had previously been in much better health, unexpectedly died, leaving Kimball as the most senior apostle and thus the presumptive new church president. Kimball was ordained church president on December 30, 1973, the day after Lee&#x27;s funeral, choosing N. Eldon Tanner and Marion G. Romney as his first and second counselors. LDS apostle Boyd K. Packer recalled shortly afterward discovering Kimball sitting alone in the church president&#x27;s office quietly weeping, and Kimball saying to him: &quot;I am such a little man for such a big responsibility!&quot;

Kimball traveled more than any previous church president, visiting a total of 85 countries worldwide. His other contributions included announcing 27 temples, dedicating four, establishing satellite communication in church buildings, and decreasing the duration of church services to three hours.

===Missionary work===
Kimball was the earliest church president to state clearly that all able-bodied LDS young men should serve a full-time mission. When Kimball became president in 1974, the church had 17,000 full-time missionaries, and within several years, it had 25,000. Additionally, under Kimball&#x27;s leadership, the number of missionaries in North America increased from 2,000 to 7,000. Between 1976 and 1978, the church built and dedicated its Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, north of BYU, where new missionaries go to receive training in scripture, teaching methods, and, if necessary, a new language.

=== 1978 revelation on priesthood ===

Beginning in the late 1840s, men of black African descent were prohibited from ordination to the LDS Church&#x27;s priesthood, which is normally held by all male members who meet church standards of spiritual &quot;worthiness&quot;, and from receiving temple ordinances such as the endowment and celestial marriage (sealing). During the 20th century, most LDS church leaders and members believed the policy had originated during founding prophet Joseph Smith&#x27;s time, but church research in the 1960s and 1970s found no evidence of the prohibition before the presidency of Brigham Young. LDS Church presidents Heber J. Grant and David O. McKay are known to have stated privately that the restriction was a temporary one that would be lifted later by a divine revelation to a church president.

In the years prior to his presidency, Kimball kept a binder of notes and clippings related to the issue. In the first years of his presidency, he was recorded as frequently making the issue one of investigation and prayer. In June 1977, Kimball asked at least three general authoritiesapostles Bruce R. McConkie, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packerto write him memoranda &quot;on the doctrinal basis of the prohibition and how a change might affect the Church.&quot; McConkie wrote a long treatise concluding there were no scriptural impediments to a change. In 1977, Kimball obtained a personal key to the Salt Lake Temple for entering in the evenings after the temple closed and often spent hours alone in its upper rooms praying for divine guidance on a possible change. On May 30, 1978, Kimball presented his two counselors with a statement that he had written in longhand that removed all racial restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, stating that he &quot;had a good, warm feeling about it&quot;.

On June 1, 1978, following the monthly meeting of general authorities in the Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that the time had come for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: &quot;There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude.&quot; L. Tom Perry described: &quot;I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed.&quot; Gordon B. Hinckley later said: &quot;For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren.&quot;

The church formally announced the change on June 9, 1978. The story led many national news broadcasts and was on the front page of most American newspapers, and in most largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho, telephone networks were completely jammed with excited callers. The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference and is included in the LDS Church&#x27;s edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.

===Equal Rights Amendment===
In 1972, the US Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which introduced an amendment to the US Constitution guaranteeing that equal rights could not be denied by the federal government or any U.S. state on the basis of gender. Upon becoming church president in late 1973, Kimball initially indicated to media outlets that the LDS Church had no official stand on the amendment and made no comment on it. In July 1974, Belle S. Spafford, the general president of the Relief Society, the LDS Church&#x27;s women&#x27;s organization and one of the oldest and largest women&#x27;s organizations in the world, gave a public talk in New York City in which she expressed her view that the amendment&#x27;s objectives would be better achieved through legislation, not the constitutional amendment, which she feared was too broad and vague. Her successor, Barbara B. Smith, echoed those sentiments later that year in a talk at the church&#x27;s Institute of Religion at the University of Utah, which was followed by a supporting editorial in the LDS &quot;Church News&quot;.

The two women&#x27;s comments, combined with the &quot;Church News&quot; editorial, greatly increased opposition to the ERA among the Utah populace, and when the Utah State Legislature voted on its ratification in February 1975, it was defeated by a wide margin. Kimball and his counselors in the First Presidency did not release a formal statement on the ERA until October 1976, when the amendment was only four states away from passing. The statement indicated that the First Presidency recognized and &quot;deplore[d]&quot; the legal injustices women had suffered throughout history, but warned that the amendment would not help women and &quot;could indeed bring them far more restraints and repression.&quot; In August 1978, the First Presidency issued a second statement elaborating on the first, in which Kimball and his counselors stated that the ERA&#x27;s &quot;deceptively simple language ... [constitutes] encouragement of those who seek a unisex society, [and] an increase in the practice of homosexual and lesbian activities.&quot;

Contemporary media coverage of the church&#x27;s opposition to the ERA was frequently negative. At the October 1980 General Conference, about 30 picketers marched outside the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and when Kimball was presented to the congregation during the customary sustaining of church officers, three women stood and shouted &quot;No! ERA policy, no!&quot; At the dedication of the church&#x27;s new temple in Seattle, in November 1980, several dozen protesters demonstrated. Minor protests and pickets continued across the United States at major church events until June 1982, when the ratification period expired without the amendment reaching the three-fourths of the states needed for ratification.

===Physical decline and death===
On March 28, 1975, his 80th birthday, Kimball said: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe that I am eighty years old... I don&#x27;t feel eighty, and I don&#x27;t think in those terms.&quot; However, Kimball suffered from a myriad of mostly minor health issues ranging from blurred vision to osteoarthritis in his spine. In July 1979, Kimball suffered a series of three minor strokes, theorized to have been caused by small nylon fibers shed by his artificial heart valve, which briefly incapacitated him but had little lasting effect. In September 1979, Kimball suddenly experienced loss of strength throughout his entire body without affecting his mental clarity. A CT scan indicated Kimball had a subdural hematoma, but its cause was never pinpointed. A neurosurgeon drilled a small hole in Kimball&#x27;s skull, just above his right ear, from which nearly one cup (235 mL) of blood and fluid drained out. Kimball left the hospital 12 days after his operation and insisted on participating in the October 1979 general conference. In November 1979, Kimball underwent a similar operation on another less severe hematoma.

In the summer of 1981, Kimball&#x27;s health began to decline rapidly. He began suffering from bouts of confusion and difficulty speaking. Realizing his deteriorating capacity and the poor health of his two counselors in the church&#x27;s First Presidency, Kimball called Gordon B. Hinckley as an additional counselor to assist in the church&#x27;s daily administration. Shortly following Hinckley&#x27;s selection, Kimball developed a third subdural hematoma of greater seriousness than the previous two. The subsequent surgery left Kimball with intermittent difficulty in speaking and activity and further damaged his vision and hearing. By 1982, Kimball was rarely well enough to appear in public, and his leadership as church president was largely limited to giving final approval or denial to more important church matters that were brought to him by Hinckley. However, Kimball still attended at least one session of each semiannual general conference of the church until his death. At the Sunday afternoon session of the church&#x27;s April 1982 general conference, Kimball unexpectedly took the pulpit to deliver a short closing message, which proved to be his final public address:

Over subsequent years, Kimball would occasionally attend meetings in the Salt Lake Temple and was able to give assent or direction on matters of significance, such as the calling of Russell M. Nelson and Dallin H. Oaks to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984, but he was otherwise mostly incapacitated.

Kimball was mentally alert for his 90th birthday on March 28, 1985, and he attended that week&#x27;s meeting of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple. In November 1985, he suffered a recurrence of a previous bleeding peptic ulcer, and his family decided not to take surgical action. Kimball died shortly after 10:00pm on November 5, 1985, at the age of 90. One of Kimball&#x27;s final utterances, which he had repeated several times in the days before his death, was &quot;My life is at an end now. She&#x27;s so happy, oh so very happy.&quot; When asked who was meant by &quot;she&quot;, Kimball indicated his mother, Olive Woolley Kimball, who had died in 1906, when he was 11.

Kimball&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2007 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==Awards and recognition==

<doc id="480756" wikidata="Q3497648" url="?curid=480756" title="K. B. Hedgewar">
<text>Keshav Baliram Hedgewar (1 April 1889 – 21 June 1940), also known by his moniker Doctorji, was an Indian physician, Hindutva activist, and the founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Hedgewar founded the RSS in Nagpur in 1925, based on the ideology of Hindu nationalism.

== Early life ==
Hedgewar was born on 1 April 1889 in a Marathi family in Nagpur, Maharashtra. His great grandfather Narhar Shastri migrated from Kandakurthi, Nizamabad district in present-day Telangana to Nagpur. His parents were Baliram Pant Hedgewar and Revatibai, a Marathi couple of modest means. When Hedgewar was thirteen both of his parents died in the Plague Epidemic of 1902. Hedgewar&#x27;s uncle ensured that he continued to receive a good education, and B. S. Moonje became a patron and a father-figure for the young Hedgewar.

He studied at Neel City High School in Nagpur, from where he was expelled singing &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; in violation of the circular issued by the then British colonial government. As a result, he had to pursue his high school studies at the Rashtriya Vidyalaya in Yavatmal and later in Pune. After matriculating, he was sent to Kolkata by B. S. Moonje (a member of the Indian National Congress, who later became the President of the Hindu Mahasabha) in 1910 to pursue his medical studies. After passing the L.M.S. Examination from the Calcutta Medical College in June 1916, he completed a yearlong apprenticeship and returned to Nagpur in 1917 as a physician.

== Ideological roots ==
After completing his education, Hedgewar joined the Anushilan Samiti in Bengal, which was influenced deeply by the writings of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. Hedgewar&#x27;s initiation into this group, rooted in Hindu symbolism, was an important step in his path towards creating the RSS. Hedgewar was also deeply influenced by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar treatise &quot;&quot;. Dr. Hedgewar was also highly influenced by Samarth Ramdas&#x27;s Dasbodh and Lokamanya Tilak&#x27;s Geeta Rahasya. His letters often bore quotes from Tukaram.

== Formation of RSS ==
Hedgewar participated in the Indian National Congress in the 1920s, but he became disillusioned with their policies and politics. He had been an active member of the party&#x27;s volunteer division - Hindustani Seva Dal, the predecessor of the Congress Seva Dal. He was deeply influenced by the writings of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Babarao Savarkar, Sri Aurobindo and B. S. Moonje. He also read Mazzini and other enlightenment philosophers. He considered that the cultural and religious heritage of Hindus should be the basis of Indian nationhood.
Hedgewar founded RSS in 1925 on the day of Vijayadashami with an aim to organise Hindu community for its cultural and spiritual regeneration and make it a tool for achieving complete independence for a united India. Hedgewar suggested the term &#x27;Rashtriya&#x27; (national) for his Hindu organization, for he wanted to re-assert the Hindu identity with &#x27;Rashtriya&#x27;. Hedgewar supported the setting up of a women&#x27;s wing of the organization in 1936 called Rashtra Sevika Samiti.

Those that participated in the movement were called Swayamsevaks (meaning volunteers). Early Swayamsevaks included Bhaiyaji Dani, Babasaheb Apte, M. S. Golwalkar, Balasaheb Deoras, and Madhukar Rao Bhagwat, among others. The Sangh (Community) was growing in Nagpur and the surrounding districts, and it soon began to spread to other provinces. Hedgewar went to a number of places and inspired the youths for taking up Sangh work. Gradually all his associates had begun to endearingly call him &#x27;Doctor ji.&#x27;

== Political activities post formation of RSS ==
After founding the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in 1925, Hedgewar maintained a healthy distance from Indian Independence movement as led by Gandhi. Instead he encouraged local Swayamsevaks to participate on their own accord with the struggle. This lack of enthusiasm in the Independence Movement is heavily criticised. Hedgewar was actively discouraging RSS cadres to not join the movement which was led by Gandhi. The RSS biographer C. P. Bhishikar states, &quot;after establishing Sangh, Doctor Saheb in his speeches used to talk only of Hindu organization. Direct comment on (British) Government used to be almost nil.&quot;

When the Congress passed the Purna Swaraj resolution in its Lahore session in December 1929, and called upon all Indians to celebrate 26 January 1930 as Independence Day, Hedgewar issued a circular asking all the RSS shakhas to observe the occasion through hoisting and worship of the Bhagwa Dhwaj (saffron flag), rather than the Tricolor (which was, by consensus, considered the flag of the Indian national movement at that time).

1930 was the only year when the RSS celebrated 26 January and it stopped the practice from the next year onwards. However, such celebration became a standard feature of the freedom movement and often came to mean violent confrontation with the official police. C. P. Bhishikar states,[In April 1930], Mahatma Gandhi gave a call for &#x27;Satyagraha&#x27; against the British Government. Gandhi himself launched the Salt Satyagraha undertaking his Dandi Yatra. Dr. Hedgewar decided to participate only individually and not let the RSS join the freedom movement officially. He sent information everywhere that the Sangh will not participate in the Satyagraha. However those wishing to participate individually in it were not prohibited.

Hedgewar emphasized that he participated in the Civil Disobedience movement of 1930 in an individual capacity, and not as a RSS member. His concern was to keep the RSS out of the political arena. According to Hedgewar&#x27;s biography, when Gandhi launched the Salt Satyagraha in 1930, he sent information everywhere that the RSS will not participate in the Satyagraha. However those wishing to participate individually in it were not prohibited.

For Hedgewar, India was an ancient civilisation, and the freedom struggle was an attempt to re-establish a land for the Hindus after almost 800 years of foreign rule, primarily by the Mughals and then by the British. The tri-colour according to Hedgewar did not encapsulate the ancient past of India. Hedgewar insisted that the RSS must only be involved with &quot;man-making&quot;.For the Pro British sentiment of RSS, several freedom fighters criticized RSS strengthening the British power.He was critical of Hindu society and its degeneration over the centuries with its out-dated and often backward practices. The RSS, he wrote, must be completely devoted to establishing men of character and worthy of respect the world over.

==Establishment of Rashtra Sevika Samiti==
Laxmibai Kelkar was the founder of the Rashtra Sevika Samiti. Before establishing the organization, Kelkar visited Dr. K.B. Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS, in 1936 and had a long discussion to persuade him regarding the need for starting a women&#x27;s wing in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh itself. Hedgewar, though, continued to restrict membership of the RSS to men. However, Hedgewar advised Laxmibai Kelkar to establish an entirely separate organization that would be autonomous and independent of the RSS, as both groups were ideologically identical. Hedgewar promised Kelkar unconditional solidarity, support and guidance for the Samithi. Following this, Kelkar established the Rashtra Sevika Samiti at Wardha on 25 October 1936.

== Death and legacy ==

His health deteriorated in later years of his life. Often he suffered from chronic back pain. He started delegating his responsibilities to M. S. Golwalkar, who later succeeded him as Sarsanghchalak of RSS. In January 1940, he was taken to Rajgir in Bihar for the hot-spring treatment.

He attended the annual &quot;Sangh Shiksha Varg&quot; (officer training camp) in 1940, where he gave his last message to Swayamsevaks, saying: &#x27;I see before my eyes today a miniature Hindu Rashtra.&quot; He died on the morning of 21 June 1940 in Nagpur. His last rites were performed in the locality of Resham Bagh in Nagpur, which was later developed as Hedgewar Smruti Mandir.

Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee described Hedgewar as a great patriot, freedom fighter and nationalist during his commemoration on a postal stamp in 1999. Hedgewar was described as &quot;a great son of Mother India&quot; by former President of India Pranab Mukherjee during his visit to Hedgewar&#x27;s birthplace in Nagpur.

<text>The Denel Rooivalk (previously designated AH-2 and CSH-2) is an attack helicopter manufactured by Denel Aviation of South Africa. &quot;Rooivalk&quot; is Afrikaans for &quot;Red Falcon&quot;, which refers to the lesser kestrel. Development of the type began in 1984 by the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. Its development was closely connected to the Atlas Oryx transport helicopter, with both aircraft being based on the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma and having started development at the same time.

Development of the Rooivalk was protracted due to the impact of limited budgets during the 1990s, and a desire to produce a highly advanced attack helicopter. The South African Air Force (SAAF) ordered 12 Rooivalk, designated the Rooivalk Mk 1 in SAAF service, the first of which were officially handed over in April 2011. The helicopters are flown by 16 Squadron, based at AFB Bloemspruit near Bloemfontein.

==Development==
===Origins===
The Rooivalk project began in early 1984 under the auspices of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation, a predecessor of Denel Aviation. Faced with the increasingly conventional nature of the South African Border War, the South African Defence Force recognised the need for a dedicated attack helicopter and began developing a suitable aircraft. The helicopter was to escort helicopter troop transports, conduct strike missions upon anti-aircraft positions, and effectively counter the increasing presence of Soviet tanks; in the latter role, it was to be equipped with anti-tank missiles. At the time, South Africa was under an arms embargo enacted by United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 due to its policy of apartheid, which prevented foreign combat helicopters from being imported.

Developing an entirely new helicopter from scratch would have involved designing and developing many accompanying subsystems and components, such as the turboshaft engines and the dynamic systems, such as the main and tail rotor systems and the gearboxes. Due to the great difficulty posed by the prospects of designing and manufacturing a clean-design helicopter, which would have substantially increased the cost and timescale of the project, it was decided to base the attack helicopter upon an existing design. At the time, the SAAF operated two principal helicopter types – the Aérospatiale Alouette III and the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. The Alouette III was a small helicopter which originated from the 1960s; due to the age of the design and a lack of engine power, it was not considered a favourable candidate for further development work.

The Puma was substantially larger and was equipped with more powerful engines; both factors provided a broader basis for the accommodation of additional equipment and for potential growth. Another key factor for its selection was the parallel development of a localised and improved model of the Puma in South Africa, known as the Atlas Oryx. The Oryx possessed an increased power-to-weight ratio and had improved performance in the high temperature climate that the type was typically being operated in; development of the Oryx was far quicker than what would become the Rooivalk as it was a more straightforward program. Other potential sources were mooted, such as the use of propulsion elements of the Aérospatiale SA 365 Dauphin; the adoption of these components has been speculated to have likely resulted in a smaller and potentially more economic rotorcraft.

Ultimately, it was decided to adopt both the powerplant and dynamic systems of the Oryx—which bore significant similarities to their Puma and Aérospatiale AS332 Super Puma ancestors—as the basis for the planned attack helicopter; commonality with the Oryx systems would simplify logistics and reduce maintenance costs. This meant that the attack helicopter would have a significantly large airframe, giving it long range and the capability to carry many sensors and armaments. During the 1980s, the defence budgets of South Africa were relatively generous, especially in contrast to later decades, thus Denel sought to provide a rotorcraft that would be amongst, even potentially superior to, the best attack helicopters in the world. The helicopter, later named the Rooivalk, was envisioned as an agile, highly sophisticated gunship, especially suited to the threats of the Angolan theatre and countering vehicles such as the T-55 tank.

The Atlas XH-1 Alpha was the first prototype to emerge from the program. It was developed from an Alouette III airframe, retaining that helicopter&#x27;s engine and dynamic components; modifications included the replacement of the original cockpit with a stepped tandem counterpart, the addition of a 20 mm cannon on the nose and the conversion of the undercarriage to a tail-dragger configuration. On 3 February 1985, the XH-1 conducted its maiden flight. The results of flight tests of the XH-1 were ultimately good enough to convince both Atlas and the SAAF that the concept was feasible, opening the door to proceed with the development of the Rooivalk.

===Into flight===

The prototype first flew on 11 February 1990, by which time the program had suffered a considerable setback. Some of the program&#x27;s ailments were a consequence of the ambition to produce a world-leading attack helicopter; while a simpler aircraft may have been completed during the 1980s, allowing it to possibly enter service around the same time as the Oryx, the Rooivalk instead suffered from a highly extended development time. In 1988, the Border War came to a close, which soon led to substantial cuts in the defence budget. The planned attack helicopter acquisition was cut from 36 rotorcraft to only 12, greatly affecting the economies of scale. In pursuit of a high-end system, the cost of the program in comparison to a simpler attack helicopter were driven upwards, although the increases were never in excess of the allotted budget between 1984 and 1990.

It has been claimed that some SAAF officials were of the viewpoint that the Rooivalk was a direct threat to fixed-wing aircraft, particularly in light of the diminishing defence budget, and sought its termination. The South African Army were broadly supportive of the Rooivalk program, in part as the presence of South African attack helicopters would reduce the need for large numbers of tanks to be procured and maintained. The Army thus provided funding for the Rooivalk program for a time, helping it survive the tightening budgetary constraints. The delays and escalating costs of the project were a hindrance not only to its introduction but to its later viability. By 1998, the year in which the first production Rooivalk was delivered to the SAAF, the lengthy development time meant that the rotorcraft was already suffering from some alleged obsolescence issues; it was an aerodynamically sound aircraft but the avionics, while advanced for the 1980s, were relatively outdated, which harmed the type&#x27;s export potential.

The topic of support for the rotorcraft was another decisive factor in prospective export sales. Beyond doubts present over the long term future of Denel and thus its ability to provide the necessary manufacturer support to operate the type, the Rooivalk relies extensively on French technology, presently owned by Airbus Helicopters; due to the Rooivalk being a rival to the Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter, the firm allegedly warned potential buyers that the necessary support for the aircraft&#x27;s dynamic systems, which they provided, may not be forthcoming. Political factors had been attributed as a major hindrance on the export market, such as pressure allegedly exercised by the United States government to persuade foreign customers to select the rival Boeing AH-64 Apache instead.

Various potential export opportunities were investigated, such as Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, however no such sales had emerged by 2013. The development of the Rooivalk had a positive effect on the development of the South African aviation and high technology industries, leading to the creation of firms such as Aerosud and Advanced Technologies and Engineering (ATE). The industrial impact of the Rooivalk program has been claimed to have enabled South African defence businesses to participate in other aerospace programs, such as the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, BAE Systems Hawk, AgustaWestland AW109, and Airbus A400M Atlas.

===Further development===
In 2016, Denel was reportedly proceeding with a &quot;Mk 1.1&quot; upgrade program for the existing Rooivalk fleet; prospective improvements include the addition of a missile approach warning system and enhancements to the rotorcraft&#x27;s avionics. On 15 September 2016, it was announced that Airbus Helicopters and Denel had signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on the SAAF modernisation program; further details on the changes included reliability and survivability improvements, an increased payload, and the replacement of obsolete targeting systems and armaments.

In September 2014, Denel Group chief executive Riaz Saloojee stated that the firm were studying the feasibility of reopening the Rooivalk production line, which had been mothballed in 2007 after the production of the initial 12 SAAF aircraft. Saloojee stated that new production aircraft conforming to an entirely new platform that used Rooivalk technology could be produced. In September 2016, the South African government authorised government-to-government negotiations on the topic of restarting production of the Rooivalk. According to Victor Xaba, deputy chief executive of Denel Aerostructures, the company needed commitments for at least 70 rotorcraft for the re-establishment of the assembly line to be viable.

The production of a prospective &quot;Rooivalk Mk 2&quot; had been periodically mooted. In July 2015, Saloojee spoke on the company&#x27;s efforts to gain support for a Rooivalk Mk 2 programme which would involve a large proportion of new systems and for which the firm had already produced a roadmap. In late 2016, Denel stated that it was conducting a series of talks with various nations on the Rooivalk Mk 2, including Egypt, Brazil, Nigeria, Poland, and India.

In 2023, Denel Aeronautics and Aselsan signed an agreement to collaborate on the avionics upgrade of the Rooivalk.

==Design==
Due to the SAAF&#x27;s decades of helicopter experience in the harsh African environment, the Rooivalk has been designed to operate for prolonged periods without sophisticated support. All that is needed to keep the Rooivalk flying is a medium transport helicopter equipped with a basic spares supply plus four groundcrew.

The Rooivalk carries a range of weapons depending on the mission profile. It is generally fitted with a nose-mounted 20 mm cannon and can also carry air-to-air missiles, anti-armour missiles and unguided rockets. The Rooivalk has a fire control system for target acquisition and tracking as well as an advanced navigation system using Doppler radar and GPS. Also incorporated is an electronic countermeasures suite coupled with chaff and flare dispensers. The Rooivalk has a nose-mounted gyro-stabilised sensor turret housing with auto-tracking. The Rooivalk uses a Thales TopOwl helmet mounted display (also used by several other attack and transport helicopters around the world). The system was developed by Société de Fabrication d’Instruments de Mesure (SFIM) in 1999/2000.

Notable features include a tandem cockpit, starboard tail rotor with a port tailplane, a fixed wheeled undercarriage as well as wire cutters above and below the cockpit and on the undercarriage. The Rooivalk is capable of doing a loop and thus momentarily &quot;flying upside down&quot;.

The following types of missions are foreseen for the Rooivalk: reconnaissance, heliborne escort, close air support, deep penetration, and anti-armour.

==Operational service==
By April 2005, only six of the 12 aircraft were available for operational test and evaluation with the others in need of software upgrades. The Chief of the South African Air Force, Lt. Gen. Carlo Gagiano, hoped that the helicopters would be ready around June 2007, indicating the &quot;extremely worrying factor of time that the project was taking to reach maturity&quot;, attributing the delays to the exodus of personnel from Denel as well as its financial problems. This has forced the SAAF to assess alternative defence development partners.

One airframe was damaged beyond repair on 3 August 2005 after an &quot;uncontrolled landing&quot;.

On 17 May 2007, Denel group CEO Shaun Liebenberg announced a decision to cease further development and funding for the Rooivalk as an export product following its failure to win the Turkish attack helicopter tender against the Agusta A129 Mangusta.

During November 2007, Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota announced in Parliament, that the SAAF was to invest R962 million (about US$137 million in 2007 exchange rates) in the helicopter over three years to 2010/2011, in order to bring it up to full operational status. The helicopter was expected to be deployed on peace-keeping duties as soon as initial operating capability is achieved.

On 1 April 2011, the SAAF received the first five of eleven (one of the twelve aircraft originally delivered to the SAAF was written off after an accident) Block 1F upgraded Rooivalk. The upgrade involves improved targeting systems and other avionics which enable the helicopter to use guided missiles for the first time. The Mokopa ATGM was qualified as part of the upgrade process. Gearbox components were improved and cooling problems with the F2 20 mm cannon were also addressed. The ninth and tenth Rooivalk attack helicopters were delivered in September 2012 following their upgrade to the Block 1F initial operating standard. The eleventh and final Rooivalk was delivered on 13 March 2013.

Three Rooivalk attack helicopters have been deployed with the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade to support the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2013.

On 4 November 2013, two Rooivalks with the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade fired &quot;FZ 90 70mm FFAR&quot; rockets on M23 positions near Chanzu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<text>François Schuiten (; born 26 April 1956) is a Belgian comic book artist. He is best known for drawing the series &quot;Les Cités Obscures&quot;.

==Biography==

François Schuiten was born in Brussels, Belgium, in 1956. 
His father, Robert Schuiten, and his mother, Marie-Madeleine De Maeyer, were both architects. He has five brothers and sisters, one of whom is also an architect.

During his studies at the Saint-Luc Institute in Brussels (1975–1977), he met Claude Renard, who led the comics department at the school. Together they created several books. Schuiten&#x27;s brother Luc also worked with him several times as a writer for the series &quot;Terres Creuses&quot;.

Schuiten published his first comic on 3 May 1973, consisting of five black and white pages in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;; four years later he was published in the more experimental magazine &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;. He married Monique Toussaint in 1980; they have four children.
Schuiten&#x27;s love of architecture became apparent in the series &quot;Cities of the Fantastic&quot;, an evocation of fantastic, partly imaginary cities that he created with his friend Benoît Peeters from 1983 for the Belgian monthly comics magazine &quot;À Suivre&quot;. Every story focuses on one city or building, and further explores a world where architects, urbanists, and ultimately &quot;urbatects&quot;, are the leading powers and architecture is the driving force behind society. Styles explored in the series include Stalinist and fascist architecture in &quot;La Fièvre d&#x27;Urbicande&quot;, skyscrapers in &quot;Brüsel&quot;, but also the Gothic cathedrals in &quot;La Tour&quot;. This fascination with architecture and the possible and impossible cities it can generate is further explored in &quot;The Gates of the Possible&quot;, a weekly series Schuiten created for the newspapers &quot;Le Soir&quot; and &quot;De Morgen&quot; in 2005.

Inspired by artists and scientists alike, Schuiten&#x27;s work can be considered to mix the mysterious worlds of René Magritte, the early scientific fantasies of Jules Verne, the graphical worlds of M. C. Escher and Gustave Doré, and the architectural visions of Victor Horta and Étienne-Louis Boullée. The creative synergy between Schuiten&#x27;s work and the books of Jules Verne culminated in 1994 when he was asked to illustrate and design a cover for the publication of Verne&#x27;s rediscovered book &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot;.

Schuiten also collaborated with Maurice Benayoun on the computer graphics series &quot;Quarxs&quot;, and worked as a production designer for a few movies: &quot;Gwendoline&quot; by Just Jaeckin, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; and &quot;Toto le héros&quot; by Jaco Van Dormael, &quot;Taxandria&quot; by Raoul Servais, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; by Chris Weitz and &quot;Mars et Avril&quot; by Martin Villeneuve. He is currently working with Benoît Sokal and Martin Villeneuve on the script of &quot;Aquarica&quot;, a film that will use CGI and motion capture technology.

As a scenographer, Schuiten designed the metro stations of Porte de Hal/Hallepoort in Brussels and Arts et Métiers in Paris, and a mural in Brussels. In 2000, he designed the scenography for &quot;A planet of visions&quot;, one of the main pavilions of the Expo 2000 in Hannover, which attracted more than five million visitors. In 2004–05, a large exhibition was held in Leuven, &quot;The Gates of Utopia&quot;, showing different aspects of his work. He also created the interior of the Belgian pavilion at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, with the painter Alexandre Obolensky. François Schuiten has also designed fifteen Belgian stamps.

Schuiten together with Peeters also helped to save and subsequently restore the Autrique House in Brussels, the first house designed by Art Nouveau architect Victor Horta.

<text>Baron Inchiquin () is one of the older titles in the Peerage of Ireland. It was one of two titles created on 1 July 1543 for Murrough O&#x27;Brien, Prince of Thomond, who claimed descent from Brian Boru, a High King of Ireland. The English titles were granted under the policy of surrender and regrant, and therefore conditional upon the abandonment of any Irish titles, the adoption of English customs and laws, pledging of allegiance to the Crown, apostasy from the Catholic Church, and conversion to the Church of Ireland. Murrough was made both Earl of Thomond in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his nephew Donough O&#x27;Brien and Baron Inchiquin, with remainder to his male heirs. Following the death of his cousin, Conor Myles John O&#x27; Brien in June 2023, Conor John Anthony O&#x27; Brien is currently the 19th Baron Inchiquin 

==History==

On his death in 1551, Murrough was succeeded in the earldom, according to the special remainder, by his nephew, the second Earl (see Earl of Thomond for the later history of this title), but the barony of Inchiquin passed to his son Dermod, the second baron. Dermod&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the sixth baron, was a prominent military commander during the Irish Confederate Wars (1643–48), first for the English Parliament, then as a Royalist commander during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53) during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1654 he was created Earl of Inchiquin in the Peerage of Ireland.

He was succeeded by his son, William O&#x27;Brien, 2nd Earl of Inchiquin, who served as governor of English Tangier and as Governor of Jamaica. His son, William O&#x27;Brien, 3rd Earl of Inchiquin, became Governor of Kinsale in 1693. The fourth earl, also named William O&#x27;Brien, represented Windsor, Camelford and Aylesbury in the British House of Commons.

The fifth earl, Murrough O&#x27;Brien, was the nephew and son-in-law of his predecessor. In 1800, he was created Marquess of Thomond in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his brother, the Honorable Edward Dominic O&#x27;Brien, a captain in the British Army. The following year he was made Baron Thomond of Taplow in the County of Buckingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom to allow him to sit in the House of Lords, with remainder to the male heirs of his body. He died without male issue in 1808, when the barony of Thomond became extinct.

He was succeeded in the marquessate according to the special remainder, and in the other Irish titles, by his nephew William O&#x27;Brien, 2nd Marquess of Thomond, the third son of the aforementioned Captain Edward O&#x27;Brien. The second marquess was an Irish representative peer. In 1826 he was created Baron Tadcaster of Tadcaster in the County of York in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He had no sons and on his death in 1846 the barony of Tadcaster became extinct.

He was succeeded in the Irish peerages by his younger brother, James O&#x27;Brien, 3rd Marquess of Thomond, an admiral in the Royal Navy. He had no sons and on his death in 1855 the marquessate and earldom of Inchiquin became extinct.

In 1855, he was succeeded in the barony of Inchiquin by his distant relative Sir Lucius O&#x27;Brien, 5th Baronet, who became the 13th Baron Inchiquin. The O&#x27;Brien Baronetcy, of Leaghmenagh in the County of Clare, had been created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1686 for Donough O&#x27;Brien, who had earlier represented County Clare in the Irish House of Commons. He was the great-great-grandson and namesake of Donough O&#x27;Brien (died 1582), younger son of the first Earl of Thomond and first Baron Inchiquin. His grandson, the second baronet, great-grandson the third baronet, and great-great-grandson the fourth baronet, also represented County Clare in the Irish Parliament, with the fourth baronet also representing Ennis. The latter was succeeded by his son, the fifth baronet.

Before becoming the 13th Baron, the fifth Baronet O&#x27;Brien had represented County Clare in the House of Commons and was later an Irish Representative Peer. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Clare. He was succeeded by his son, Edward O&#x27;Brien, 14th Baron Inchiquin, also an Irish Representative Peer and Lord Lieutenant of County Clare. His son, Lucius O&#x27;Brien, 15th Baron Inchiquin, also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer, and also served in the British military and had been appointed High Sheriff of Clare in 1898, and justice of the peace of Salop.

According to Desmond Oulton (owner of Clontarf Castle), his father John George Oulton had suggested to Éamon de Valera towards the end of the Irish Free State, that Ireland should have its own king again, as it was in the times of Gaelic Ireland. He suggested to him, a member of the O&#x27;Brien Clan, descended in the paternal line from Brian Boru, a previous High King of Ireland: the most senior representative at the time was Donough O&#x27;Brien, 16th Baron Inchiquin. Oulton said that Donough&#x27;s nephew Conor O&#x27;Brien, 18th Baron Inchiquin, confirmed that De Valera did offer Donough O&#x27;Brien the title of Prince-President of the Irish Republic, but this was turned down and so a President of Ireland was instituted instead. The 16th Baron was succeeded by his younger brother Phaedrig O&#x27;Brien, 17th Baron Inchiquin, a consulting geologist, who in turn was succeeded by his nephew, the 18th baron. Following the death of the 18th baron in 2023, the direct male line of the 15th baron failed; the 18th baron was succeeded by his second cousin.

In the Gaelic nobility, Lord Inchiquin is The O&#x27;Brien, Chief of the Name, Prince of Thomond.

The family seat of the O&#x27;Brien Baronetcy was Dromoland Castle, near Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare. The current Baron Inchiquin lives in Thomond House adjacent to Dromoland.

<text>Baron Carbery, of Carbery in the County of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1715 for George Evans, with remainder to the heirs male of his father and namesake George Evans, a supporter of William and Mary during the Glorious Revolution, who had earlier declined the offer of a peerage. After his elevation to the peerage, Lord Carbery represented Westbury in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Westbury. His grandson, the fourth Baron, briefly represented Rutland in Parliament. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Baron. On his death, the line of the eldest son of the first Baron failed. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron, who had previously succeeded his father as second Baronet, of Castle Freke. Lord Carbery sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1824 to 1845. His nephew, the eighth Baron, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1891 to 1894. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the twelfth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2012.

The Baronetcy, of Castle Freke in the County of Cork, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1768 for John Evans-Freke, son of Grace daughter and heiress of Sir Ralph Freke, 1st Baronet of West Bilney Norfolk and the Hon. John Evans, younger son of the first Baron Carbery. On his death, the title passed to his son, the second Baronet. In 1807 he succeeded his first cousin once removed as sixth Baron Carbery. The titles have remained united since.

As of 28 February 2014, the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2012.

<text>Back to Reality is a reality television show featuring stars from previous reality television programmes. The show was broadcast on Channel 5 between 15 February 2004 to 5 March 2004.

It was advertised by Channel 5 as being &quot;The biggest reality show of all time&quot; however in terms of ratings, it failed to deliver. The 12 contestants spent 3 weeks in a studio built mansion, with no natural sunlight. In the final two weeks, the public voted for their favourite housemate with the two people with the lowest votes every 3/4 nights being put to the housemate vote, where the other contestants had to vote for who they wanted to leave. The show was presented by Tess Daly and Richard Bacon, the first and only series of the show finished with James Hewitt winning the show ahead of Maureen Rees and Craig Phillips.

==Ratings==
The ratings rarely went over 1.6 million despite the show extending its hours (early morning and afternoon live streaming). The lack of ratings was put down to the lack of tabloid interest in the show, despite the sponsoring of the show by popular celebrity magazine &#x27;Heat&#x27; and the constant arguments and major events that happened in the house.

==Highlights==
Events included the threatened walk-out of the contestants after Nick Bateman was referred to as &quot;Nasty Nick&quot;, the planned addition of Jade Goody&#x27;s then boyfriend Jeff Brazier (from the reality TV show &quot;Shipwrecked&quot;) as a thirteenth contestant, Uri Geller walking out, the suspicion of Josie D&#x27;Arby being a mole (and the subsequent arguments and divides), the love interest between James Hewitt and Sarah Kozer, the rushing of Jade Goody to hospital and the &quot;Ricardo Incident&quot; when the flamboyant cross-dresser Rocardo Ribero argued with other housemates and then proceeded to destroy the kitchen. The show ended when the public voted &quot;The Games&quot; star James Hewitt to be the winner with Maureen Rees coming second.

==Aftermath==
Since the show, Channel 5 confessed that &quot;Back to Reality&quot; was an expensive but worthwhile experiment however it is unlikely to return. Goody&#x27;s aggression towards Rik Waller in the series, though attracting little comment at the time, was later cited as evidence that she was a serial bully following her appearance in Celebrity Big Brother. However they only actually had one row and made up soon afterwards for the duration of the series.

=== Notes ===
*: James, who received the most votes after the vote count, had to break the tie in order for either Lizzy or Sarah to be evicted.

<doc id="480844" wikidata="Q357212" url="?curid=480844" title="Rewi Alley">
<text>Rewi Alley (known in China as 路易•艾黎, Lùyì Aìlí, 2 December 1897 – 27 December 1987) was a New Zealand-born writer and political activist. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he dedicated 60 years of his life to the cause and was a key figure in the establishment of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives and technical training schools, including the Bailie Schools and Peili Vocational Institute (now Beijing Bailie University), both named after his mentor Joseph Bailie. Alley was a prolific writer about 20th century China, and especially the communist revolution. He also translated numerous Chinese poems.

==Early life and influences==
Rewi was born in the small town of Springfield, in inland Canterbury, New Zealand. He was named after Rewi Maniapoto, a Māori chief who famously resisted the British military during the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s. Alley&#x27;s father was a teacher, and Rewi attended primary school at Amberley; then Wharenui School in Christchurch, where his father was appointed headmaster in 1905; and finally Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School. His mother, Clara, was a leader of the New Zealand women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

His parents&#x27; keen interest in social reform and education influenced all of their children:
*brother Geoff (1903–1986) became an All Black and worked as a travelling WEA (Workers&#x27; Educational Association) tutor sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, before becoming New Zealand&#x27;s first National Librarian in 1964;
*sister Gwendolen (Gwen Somerset) (1894–1988) was a pioneer in primary school education practices, and president of the New Zealand Federation of Nursery Play Centres&#x27; Associations (Playcentre);
*younger sister Joyce (1908–2000) became a prominent nursing administrator; and
*brother Philip (1901–1978) was a lecturer at the engineering school of the University of Canterbury. He is credited with the idea of moving the university campus from central Christchurch to the suburb of Ilam.
Rewi&#x27;s elder brother, Eric, fought in WW1 in the Otago Regiment, NZEF, and rose to the rank of captain. He was fatally wounded in action and died on 17 June 1916, at the age of 23.

In 1916, Alley joined the New Zealand Army and was sent to serve in France, where he won the Military Medal. There, he met workers in the Chinese Labour Corps who had been sent to work for the Allied armies. During the war, he was injured and caught in no man&#x27;s land. Lyall McCallum and another man rescued him and took him back to safety. After the war, Alley tried farming in New Zealand.

In 1927, he decided to go to China. He moved to Shanghai with thoughts of joining the Shanghai Municipal Police, but instead, he became a fire officer and municipal factory inspector. The duties exposed him to the poverty in the Chinese community and the racism in the Western communities. He joined a political study group whose members included Alec Camplin, George Hatem, Ruth Weiss, Trude Rosenberg, Heinz Schippe, Irene Wiedemeyer, Talitha Gerlach, Maud Russell, Lily Haass, Cora Deng and Cao Liang.

His politics turned from fairly-conventional right-wing pro-empire sentiments to thoughts of social reform. In particular, a famine in 1929 made him aware of the plight of China&#x27;s villages. Using his holidays and taking time off work, Alley toured rural China helping with relief efforts. He adopted a 14-year-old Chinese boy, Duan Si Mou, whom he named Alan, in 1929.

After a brief visit to New Zealand, where Alan experienced public racism, Alley became Chief Factory Inspector for the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1932. By then, he was a secret member of the Chinese Communist Party and was involved in anti-criminal activities on behalf of the party. He adopted another Chinese son, Li Xue, whom he called Mike, in 1932. After the outbreak of war with Japan in 1937, Alley set up the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. He also set up schools, which he called Bailie Schools after his American friend Joseph Bailie. Edgar Snow wrote of Alley&#x27;s work in the CIC: &quot;Where Lawrence brought to the Arabs the distinctive technique of guerilla war, Alley was to bring China the constructive technique of guerilla industry...&quot;

By 1941, Alley was one of the contacts of the Chinese Communist Party in the English-speaking world. Due to his purported knowledge of the Chinese way of war, Colonel Gordon Grimsdale of the Far East Combined Bureau interviewed him after being asked by Major-General Christopher Maltby (who recently assumed the post as General Officer Commanding Hong Kong) about recruiting more Hong Kong soldiers for local defence in face of the coming war. Alley, however, oversold his case. He &quot;expressed the gravest doubts as to the efficacy of attempting to raise an infantry unit for purely local defence&quot; because he did not &quot;think suitable material [was] available either as leaders or for the rank and file&quot;, and questioned if the garrison had the time to train and equip such a unit. On the other hand, Alley was &quot;extremely optimistic on the subject of starting a guerrilla unit for the indirect defence of the Colony&quot;, and proposed to send &quot;a [suitably] equipped party to Canton to burn Japanese aeroplanes on the Canton aerodrome, or to destroy some important bridge(s)&quot;. Training would be carried out in Hong Kong, in the name of forming a labour battalion, and the soldiers should consist of those who were interned in Hong Kong. He stressed the importance of introducing &quot;pro-Chinese&quot; education for the soldiers and he pro- posed that &quot;the best man he can suggest as the chief organizer is Yeh Chieh Ying (Ye Jianying)&quot;, a Cantonese Communist general.

In 1945, he became headmaster of the Shandan Bailie School after the death of George Hogg.

==After communist victory==
Following the Communist victory over the Nationalists in 1949, Alley was urged to remain in China and to work for the Chinese Communist Party. He produced many works praising the party and the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including &quot;Yo Banfa!&quot;, &quot;Man Against Flood&quot; and &quot;China&#x27;s Hinterland in the Great Leap Forward&quot;. Some of his published works have historic interest. Although imprisoned and &quot;struggled with&quot; during the Cultural Revolution, Alley remained committed to communism and bore no grudges.

In 1963, Edgar Snow after the publication of his book &quot;The Other Side of The River: Red China Today&quot;, was described as an associate of Alley in a Sydney book review.

In 1973, New Zealand civil servant Gerald Hensley and the new New Zealand Ambassador to China, Bryce Harland, called on Alley. &quot;He was in his seventies, a bald, pink-faced man with bright blue eyes, and an inexhaustible flow of conversation. We sat and talked for most of an afternoon, with Rewi occasionally jumping up to fetch a book or check a point. He had, he said, lost the best of two libraries, once to the Japanese and again to the Red Guards, who had thrown out his collections and torn up his pictures in front of him. He was still bitter over their behaviour.&quot; He was living in the old Italian Legation, which had been converted into flats for the leading foreign friends of China, which were allocated on the &quot;bleak basis&quot; of seniority. On the death of the previous occupant Anna Louise Strong, Rewi moved downstairs into the best front apartment and everyone else moved on one place.

Unlike most of the friends of the Chinese Communist Party who remained in Beijing, Alley had little trouble travelling around the world, usually lecturing on the need for nuclear disarmament. The New Zealand government did not strip Alley of his passport and remained proud of his ties to important party leaders. In the 1950s, he is reported to have been offered a knighthood but turned the honour down. He supported the Communist North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for community service in the 1985 New Year Honours. At the ceremony, New Zealand&#x27;s Prime Minister, David Lange, made a moving and dramatic speech, turned to Alley at its conclusion and said with sincerity, &quot;New Zealand has had many great sons, but you, Sir, are our greatest son.&quot;

==Death and legacy ==
He died in Beijing on 27 December 1987. New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange eulogised him on his 90th birthday, just weeks before his death.

His house in Beijing is now the offices of the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

In 1996, Jack Body wrote an opera in three acts, &quot;Alley&quot;, based on his life, with libretto by Geoff Chapple. It was performed at the International Festival of the Arts in Wellington in 1998.

===Memorial at Springfield===
An extensive memorial to Rewi Alley has been erected at Springfield, Canterbury, New Zealand. It contains a large stone carving and a number of panels giving details of his life.

===Rewi Alley Memorial Hall and Research Centre at Lanzhou City University College===
Opened in 2017 on the occasion of the 120th anniversary of Alley&#x27;s birth is a three-story Rewi Alley Memorial Building. The memorial hall operates as a free public museum and is within the grounds of the Lanzhou City University Bailie Campus (the site of the former Bailie Oil School, the successor to Rewi Alley and George Hogg&#x27;s Bailie Vocational School in nearby Shandan). The Memorial Hall contains an extensive and permanent display of Rewi Alley history and chronicles his contributions as an educator and internationalist in China. The hall is open at normal opening hours and can be found adjacent to the Rewi Alley bust at the Bailie Campus of the university.

===Rewi Alley Memorial House in Shandan===
A replica of the home that Alley lived in when he was the headmaster of the original Shandan Bailie School has samples of Rewi&#x27;s belongings and furniture, including a kang bed, tables, typewriter, books, and pictures of 1940s school life.

==Views of China and New Zealand==

Some of Alley&#x27;s private conversations revealed his views on his birth and adopted countries:

&quot;Never mind about whether you are a student of China or not, as long as you are among the ordinary people you will get an understanding, a real understanding of this country. You&#x27;re already in amongst it... Some very bad things happened. The price of China breaking free of foreign domination and the bad things of its past was enormous. They reckon that it cost 30 million lives to build new China. The West should have a bit more gratitude for the struggle of the Chinese. If it wasn&#x27;t for the resistance in China during the Second World War, the Japanese would have had tens of thousands more men and they may have got as far as Australia and New Zealand. Back then sides were clear-cut. They were clearer even before the war, if you had the wit to see it. I became involved in China&#x27;s struggle and I chose my side. After the war and the revolution, I knew I had a choice. I could have joined the critics of China, but China had become like my family and as in all families, even though you might have been arguing with each other, when the guests come you present a loyal unified face to the world. I could have joined the journalists and so-called sinologists in condemning everything about the revolution, but I had already chosen my side.&quot;

&quot;This place (China) is a great case study of humanity; one of the biggest examples of humanity&#x27;s struggle. If you can&#x27;t feel for these people, you can&#x27;t feel anything for the world. Although it was in France, in the First World War, that I first had a taste of China. I can remember when there were a lot of shells falling and we had our rifles and our steel helmets on and there were these coolies. Coolies, that&#x27;s a word people don&#x27;t use much any more; but that&#x27;s what they were, these Chinese labourers. Coolie comes from the word bitterness. These blokes were eating their fair share of bitterness in France. Navvies for the poms, they were. Shells bursting and the ground shaking like there was an earthquake, and they were stripped to their skinny waists and just kept unloading the wagons. I saw endurance and a determination that I had seldom seen before. Then later, back there in the thirties, I was involved in the factories in Shanghai and I can remember seeing sacks in the alleys at the back of the factories. At first I thought they were sacks of rubbish, but they weren&#x27;t, they were dead children. Children worked to death in the foreign-owned factories. Little bundles of humanity worked to death for someone&#x27;s bloody profit. So I decided that I would work to help China. I suppose then it was like a marriage of sorts and I wrote what I wrote and said what I said out of loyalty to that marriage. I know China&#x27;s faults and contradictions; there are plenty of those. But I wanted to work for this place and I still do. I woke up to some important things here and so I felt I owed China something for that.&quot;

&quot;I had human principles and I made choices based on these. I have always been and will always be a New Zealander; although New Zealand has not always seen me as that. But I know my own motives. The buggers even refused to renew my passport at one point and they treated my adopted son very badly. Did you know that when Robert Muldoon visited Mao Zedong in the 1970s he was the last head of state to see him? Well I&#x27;m told that when Muldoon asked what he could do for Mao, Mao is supposed to have said &#x27;Give Alley his passport back.&#x27; &quot;

&quot;I love New Zealand, and sometimes miss it. New Zealand is a good country, populated by basically just and practical people. But there is a fascist streak in New Zealand as well, and we must always be vigilant to prevent it from having too much sway. I remember as a boy, I was walking along the beach near Christchurch and there was a group of men coming back from a strike, or a picket of some kind. Suddenly, out of the dunes came police on horseback and they rode into these unarmed workingmen, swinging their clubs as if they were culling seals. I will stand up against such forces as long as I can stand. Even here, in the Cultural Revolution, when some young blokes came in here and started breaking things I grabbed one of them and put him over my knee and gave him a proper hiding. I got army guards on the gate after that. That was thanks to Zhou Enlai, looking after an old mate from Shanghai; but I stood up to them. I know many in New Zealand see me as a traitor to their culture, but I have never betrayed New Zealand. What I betrayed was the idea many New Zealanders had of what a Kiwi should be and what was right and wrong in the political world. There is a very big difference.&quot;

&quot;Successive New Zealand governments have tried hard to discredit me as if I was some sort of communist threat to them or a traitor. Well I am a communist, but I am not a traitor. I have always loved New Zealand. I just said what I thought was important and true.&quot;

==Private life==
Anne-Marie Brady in &quot;Friend of China&quot; wrote that Rewi Alley was homosexual. Jack Body (who in 1998, with Geoff Chapple, wrote an opera based on Alley&#x27;s life) has stated that this assertion was likely to be true and his sexual orientation was important in understanding Alley&#x27;s personality and the choices he made.
Roderic Alley wrote in &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand Biography&quot; &quot;Alley was almost certainly homosexual, and never married.&quot;

He met the British biochemist and historian Joseph Needham in the summer of 1943 and they became lifelong friends.

==Works==

Alley translated numerous Chinese poems and wrote a number of original works. Alley described his writing as follows: &quot;It became my way of contributing. There was so much going on in China. I felt I had to help people understand. I am not a writer. I am certainly not much of a poet. But it was my work. You know, sometimes it would take me hours to get one page finished.&quot;

<doc id="480845" wikidata="Q2191" url="?curid=480845" title="Leningrad Oblast">
<text>Leningrad Oblast (, ; ; ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). The oblast has an area of and a population of 2,000,997 (2021 Census); up from 1,716,868 recorded in the 2010 Census. Leningrad Oblast is highly industrialized. Its administrative center and largest city is Gatchina.

The oblast was established on 1 August 1927, although it was not until 1946 that the oblast&#x27;s borders had been mostly settled in their present position. The oblast was named after the city of Leningrad. In 1991, the city restored its original name, Saint Petersburg, but the oblast retains the name of Leningrad. It overlaps the historical region of Ingria, and is bordered by Finland (Kymenlaakso and South Karelia) in the northwest and Estonia (Ida-Viru County) in the west, as well as five federal subjects of Russia: the Republic of Karelia in the northeast, Vologda Oblast in the east, Novgorod Oblast in the south, Pskov Oblast in the southwest, and the federal city of Saint Petersburg in the west.

The first governor of Leningrad Oblast was Vadim Gustov (in 1996–1998). The current governor, since 2012, is Aleksandr Drozdenko.

==Geography==

Leningrad Oblast is located around the Gulf of Finland and south of two great freshwater lakes, Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The oblast includes the Karelian Isthmus and some islands, including Gogland in the Gulf of Finland and Konevets in Lake Ladoga.

Much of the area of the oblast belongs to the drainage basin of the Neva, which is the only outflow of Lake Ladoga. The Neva, which flows to the Gulf of Finland (the city of Saint Petersburg is located in its river delta) is relatively short, but its drainage basin is very large, including Lake Onega and Lake Ilmen. The Svir and the Volkhov flow from Lake Onega and Lake Ilmen, respectively, to Lake Ladoga. Other major tributaries of Lake Ladoga include the Vuoksi and the Syas. Rivers in the western part of the oblast flow to the Gulf of Finland; the two biggest rivers there are the Luga and the Narva, which forms the border of Russia and Estonia. Small areas in the east of the oblast lie within the river basin of the Chagodoshcha, a tributary of the Mologa, and of the Suda, both within the Volga basin. A ridgeline in Tikhvinsky District in the eastern oblast forms part of the divide between the Baltic Sea and Caspian Sea basins.

The terrain of Leningrad Oblast is relatively flat and mostly covered with forest and swamps. An exception is the rocky Karelian Isthmus, which contains a lake district, as well as the Vepsian Upland in the east. The biggest lakes on the isthmus are Lake Vuoksa, Lake Sukhodolskoye, and Lake Otradnoye.

Leningrad Oblast contains two federally protected natural areas, the Nizhnesvirsky Nature Reserve and Mshinskoye Boloto Zakaznik, both created to protect the forest and swamp landscapes of northwestern Russia.

===Flora===
The most taxonomically diverse vascular plant families are Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Rosaceae. By far the most diverse genus is &quot;Carex&quot; (68 species). The diversity in genera &quot;Hieracium&quot; (with &quot;Pilosella&quot;), &quot;Ranunculus&quot; (with &quot;Batrachium&quot;), &quot;Alchemilla&quot;, &quot;Galium&quot;, &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, &quot;Salix&quot;, &quot;Veronica&quot;, &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Juncus&quot;, &quot;Artemisia&quot;, &quot;Potentilla&quot;, &quot;Rumex&quot;, &quot;Festuca&quot;, &quot;Epilobium&quot;, &quot;Poa&quot;, &quot;Trifolium&quot;, &quot;Campanula&quot;, &quot;Vicia&quot;, &quot;Lathyrus&quot;, &quot;Geranium&quot; is also considerable. The territory has no endemic plant taxa. Vascular plant species of Leningrad Oblast listed in the red data book of Russia are &quot;Botrychium simplex&quot;, &quot;Cephalanthera rubra&quot;, &quot;Cypripedium calceolus&quot;, &quot;Epipogium aphyllum&quot;, &quot;Lobelia dortmanna&quot;, &quot;Myrica gale&quot;, &quot;Ophrys insectifera&quot;, &quot;Orchis militaris&quot;, &quot;Pulsatilla pratensis&quot;, &quot;Pulsatilla vernalis&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The territory of present-day Leningrad Oblast was populated shortly after the end of the Weichselian glaciation and now hosts numerous archaeological remnants. The Volga trade route and trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks crossed the territory. Staraya Ladoga, the first capital of legendary Rurik, founded in the 8th-9th century, is situated in the east of the oblast, on the Volkhov River.

In the 12th-15th centuries, the territory was divided between the Kingdom of Sweden and Novgorod Republic (see Swedish-Novgorodian Wars) and populated mostly by various Baltic Finns people such as Karelians (northwest), Izhorians and Votes (west), Vepsians (east), as well as Ilmen Slavs of Novgorod (south). During the Russo-Swedish Wars of the 15th-17th centuries, the border moved back and forth over the land.

The central part of the territory is known as the historical region of Ingria (or the land of Izhora) and in the 17th century, after most of the present-day territory of Leningrad Oblast was captured by Sweden with the Treaty of Stolbovo of 1617, became subject to substantial Finnish Lutheran population influx from Finnish Karelia (which included Karelian Isthmus, the northwestern part of present-day Leningrad Oblast) and Savonia. Having faced religious pressure from Lutheran pastors and Swedish authorities, the local Orthodox population of Russian and Finnic ancestry massively fled from Ingria to neighbour Russian provinces, so Ingrian Finns soon became the dominant ethnic group.

During the Great Northern War (1700–1721) the territory of what is now Leningrad Oblast was conquered from Sweden by Russia under Peter the Great, who founded Saint Petersburg amidst the land in 1703, which soon became the capital of the Russian Empire. In 1708, most of the territory was organized into Ingermanland Governorate under Governor General Alexander Menshikov. It was renamed Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710 (the borders of that governorate, however, differed very significantly from those of the present-day oblast and included much of the areas of current Novgorod, Pskov, and Vologda Oblasts). In 1721, the territorial concessions of Sweden were confirmed with the Treaty of Nystad.

The life of the countryside was greatly influenced by the vicinity of the imperial capital, which became a growing market for its agricultural production as well as the main consumer of its mineral and forest resources. In 1719–1810, Ladoga Canal was dug between the Svir River and the Neva River as part of the Volga-Baltic waterway to bypass stormy waters of Lake Ladoga. Since the advent of rail transport in the late 19th century, the areas in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg had been popular summer resort destinations (dachas) for its residents. However, while Saint Petersburg itself was populated mostly by Russians from the very beginning, it was not until the 20th century that its surrounding population was Russified.

In 1914, with the beginning of World War I, Saint Petersburg was renamed Petrograd and the governorate was accordingly renamed Petrograd Governorate. After the Russian Revolution, in 1918, the capital was transferred from Petrograd to Moscow, farther from the borders of the country. In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the Northwestern White Army advancing from Estonia and led by Nikolai Yudenich tried to capture Petrograd and even managed to reach its southern outskirts, but the attack against the Red Army under Leon Trotsky ultimately failed, and Yudenich retreated. The border with Estonia was established in the Russian-Estonian Treaty of Tartu of 1920. Finland-backed Ingrian Finns of North Ingria attempted to secede in 1918–1920, but were incorporated back with the Russian-Finnish Treaty of Tartu, which settled the border between Finland and Soviet Russia. In 1924, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad, and Petrograd Governorate was again renamed accordingly (Leningrad Governorate).

===Leningrad Oblast===
Leningrad Oblast was established on 1 August 1927, by the resolutions of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee &quot;On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast&quot; and &quot;On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast&quot; by merging Cherepovets, Leningrad, Murmansk, Novgorod, and Pskov Governorates. The territory of the oblast corresponded to the modern territories of the present-day Leningrad Oblast (with the exception of the Karelian Isthmus and the territories along the border with Estonia), Novgorod Oblast, Pskov Oblast, parts of Vologda Oblast, most of Murmansk Oblast, and the federal city of Saint Petersburg. The total area of the oblast was ; more than four times larger than the modern entity. Administratively, the oblast was divided into nine okrugs (Borovichi, Cherepovets, Leningrad, Lodeynoye Pole, Luga, Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, and Velikiye Luki), each of which was in turn subdivided into districts.

In 1929, Velikiye Luki Okrug was transferred to newly formed Western Oblast. Leningrad was administratively separated from Leningrad Oblast in December 1931. In 1935 five southernmost districts were made part of Kalinin Oblast. In 1936 some parts of the territory of Leningrad Suburban District of Leningrad was returned to Leningrad Oblast and divided into Vsevolozhsky District, Krasnoselsky District, Pargolovsky District and Slutsky District (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944). Vologda Oblast, which has included the easternmost districts of Leningrad Oblast (former Cherepovets Governorate), was created in 1937. Murmansk Oblast was split from Leningrad Oblast in 1938.

In the autumn of 1934, the Forbidden Border Zone along the western border of the Soviet Union was established, where nobody could appear without special permission issued by the NKVD. It was officially only 7.5 km deep initially, but along the Estonian border it extended to as much as 90 km. The zone was to be cleansed of Finnic and other peoples who were considered &quot;politically unreliable&quot; by the regime. Starting from the 1929, the Soviet authorities carried out mass deportations of the Ingrian Finnish population of the oblast, which constituted the majority in many rural localities as late as in the beginning of the 20th century, to the east, replacing them with people from other parts of the Soviet Union.

On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union waged the Winter War against neighbouring Finland and with the Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940 gained some territories, including the Karelian Isthmus. Their Karelian population was hastily evacuated to inner Finland and later replaced with people from other parts of the Soviet Union. A small part of the territory (the municipalities of Kanneljärvi, Koivisto and Rautu) was incorporated into Leningrad Oblast, the rest being included within the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.

In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, and shortly thereafter the territory became the site of the Battle of Leningrad. The Wehrmacht captured the southwestern part of the oblast and reached Tikhvin in the east, while Finnish troops quickly recaptured the ceded territories in the Continuation War, encircling Leningrad from the land. In 1944 Soviet offensives managed to expel the Wehrmacht and put military pressure on Finland, which ceded the Karelian Isthmus again in the Moscow Armistice of September 19, 1944. This time the newly acquired territories on the isthmus were incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast (Vyborgsky and Priozersky Districts). In 1947 the territorial gains were confirmed with the Paris Peace Treaty. Novgorod and Pskov Oblasts were formed out of the southern parts of Leningrad Oblast in 1944. In January 1945 a small part of the Estonian SSR to the east of the River Narva with the town of Jaanilinn (now Ivangorod) was transferred to the Russian SFSR and incorporated into Leningrad Oblast. Since then, the territory of Leningrad Oblast has not changed significantly, although some suburbs of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) have been excluded from the oblast and incorporated into the city. In October 1946 Leningrad gained from the oblast some former Finnish territories along the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland divided into Sestroretsky District and Kurortny District, including the town of Terijoki.

In 1953, Pavlovsky District of the oblast was abolished, and parts of its territory including Pavlovsk were made subordinate to Leningrad. In 1954 the settlements Levashovo, Pargolovo and Pesochny were also transferred to Leningrad. In 1956 Boksitogorsky District of Leningrad Oblast gained a small territory of Novgorod Oblast. Uritsk was transferred from the oblast to the city of Leningrad in 1963, Krasnoye Selo and several settlements nearby—in 1973, Lomonosov—in 1978.

After a referendum in 1991, the city of Leningrad was renamed back to Saint Petersburg, but Leningrad Oblast retained its name. On 13 June 1996, Leningrad Oblast, alongside Tver Oblast and Saint Petersburg, signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 18 April 2002.

They connect Saint-Petersburg with Moscow (Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway), Helsinki via Vyborg, Murmansk via Petrozavodsk, Sortavala via Priozersk, Tallinn via Kingisepp, Riga via Pskov, Vitebsk via Dno, and Veliky Novgorod. There is a network of railways at the Karelian Isthmus, in particular, connecting Vyborg and Priozersk, as well as south of Saint-Petersburg. There also railway lines connecting Veymarn with Slantsy, Veymarn with Petergof via Sosnovy Bor, Mga with Sonkovo via Kirishi, Volkhov with Vologda via Tikhvin and Cherepovets, Volkhov with Chudovo, and Lodeynoye Pole with Sortavala via Olonets. Most of them support intensive passenger and cargo traffic.

Paved roads well cover the western and the central parts of Leningrad Oblast. The M10 highway connects Saint Petersburg with Moscow via Veliky Novgorod in the south and with the Finnish border, continuing across the border to Helsinki, in the north. It is split between European routes E18 (Saint Petersburg to Finland) and E105 (Saint Petersburg to Moscow), and much of it within the oblast is built as a dual carriageway. R21 highway (also part of E105) runs from Saint Petersburg to Murmansk via Petrozavodsk, and A180 (part of E20) connects Saint Petersburg with Ivangorod and continues across the Estonian border to Tallinn. R23 connects Saint Petersburg with Pskov; it is a part of the E95. A114 runs to Vologda via Cherepovets. A paid motorway between Saint Petersburg and Moscow and the new A121 from Saint-Petersburg to Sortavala, around the Western coast of Ladoga are under construction. Roads are well served by bus traffic.

The Luga, the Svir, the Volkhov, and the Neva are all navigable and heavily user for cargo transport, however, there is no scheduled passenger navigation within the oblast, except for seasonal leisure river cruises from Saint-Petersburg. The Onega Canal, shared with Vologda Oblast, serves as a bypass of Lake Onega from the south. Similarly, the Ladoga Canal bypasses Lake Ladoga from the east, from the Svir to the Neva. It is a part of the Volga–Baltic Waterway. In contrast, the Tikhvinskaya water system, connecting the Syas and the Mologa, which provided access from the Ladoga to the river basin of the Volga, is disused. The trans-border Saimaa Canal connects Lake Saimaa in Finland with the Gulf of Finland, has special status, and is occasionally used for passenger navigation.

Ust-Luga, Vyborg, Vysotsk, and Primorsk are the major sea terminals on the Gulf of Finland.

There is a number of airfields in Leningrad oblast that are now used only by the general aviation. Scheduled and international flights are available exclusively from Pulkovo airport in Saint-Petersburg.

===Energy===

The Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant is located in the city of Sosnovy Bor. There are four major hydroelectric plants in the oblast. The Volkhov Hydroelectric Station, on the Volkhov River, was constructed in 1921 and became the first major hydropower station in the Soviet Union. The others are the Upper Svir Hydroelectric Station and the Lower Svir Hydroelectric Station, both on the Svir River, and the Narva Hydroelectric Station on the Narva River.

===Science and technology===
There are many science and high-tech institutions around Saint Petersburg, some of which are located in the oblast. For example, Gatchina is the site of the and Sosnovy Bor hosts the Research Institute of Optical and Electronic Devices.

===Architecture===
Since prehistory, the Volkhov and the Neva Rivers were constituents of major trade routes, and archaeological sites dot their banks. Staraya Ladoga has many pre-1700 sites, including two of about a couple of dozens standing pre-Mongol churches in Russia. Both of them were built in the 1160s. The Oreshek Fortress in Shlisselburg and the Koporye Fortress, both built in the 14th century, and the Ivangorod Fortress, originally built in 1492, are excellent examples of Russian fortification art. Podporozhsky District contains the best samples of wooden ecclesiastical architecture in Leningrad Oblast, some of which are collectively referred to as &quot;Podporozhye Ring&quot;: The Resurrection Church in the settlement of Vazhiny, the Saint Nicholas Church in the village of Soginitsy, the Sts Peter and Paul Chapel in the village of Zaozerye, and the Saint Athanasy chapel in the village of Posad. The two other notable wooden churches are located in the villages of Gimreka and Shcheleyki close to the Onega Lakeshore. The center of Vyborg preserves many examples of medieval Swedish architecture, unique for Russia.

After Saint Petersburg was founded in 1703, many estates and residences were founded around the city. Some of them still stand and are listed as World Heritage sites, aggregated into the site of Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. includes, among others, estates in Gostilitsy, Ropsha, and Taytsy.

Localities in the Karelian Isthmus preserve some fine inter-war Finnish architecture. The best-known example is the Viipuri Municipal Library by Alvar Aalto.

<text>Thom Kallor is a character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, primarily as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. The character has also been known as Star Boy and [[Starman (DC Comics)|Starman]].

Kallor as Star Boy has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily those featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes. He is voiced by Bumper Robinson in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006) and Elyes Gabel in &quot;Justice League vs. the Fatal Five&quot;.

==Publication history==
Thom Kallor first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #282 and was created by Otto Binder and George Papp.

==Fictional character biography==
===Legion of Super-Heroes===

Star Boy is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, a group of young heroes living a millennium in the future. He is born to astronomer parents on a satellite orbiting the planet Xanthu, and can temporarily increase the mass of an object, up to the mass of a star.

Star Boy is expelled from the Legion for killing his girlfriend Dream Girl&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Kenz Nuhor in self-defense. After this, he and Dream Girl join the Legion of Substitute Heroes before returning to the Legion.

Following &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, which reboots the Legion&#x27;s continuity, Thom Kallor discovers that he is destined to travel back to the 21st century, assume the mantle of Starman, and die.

===2005 reboot===

Mark Waid&#x27;s 2005 Legion reboot depicts Star Boy as black and Cosmic Boy&#x27;s right-hand man.

In &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, Thom Kallor is depicted as having schizophrenia before Gog restores his sanity. It is also revealed that his suit is a map of the multiverse and was created by Brainiac 5.

In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, it is revealed that Starman was sent to the 21st century to resurrect Superboy and carry out R. J. Brande&#x27;s will.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Thom Kallor is killed in an attack by the Fatal Five before being resurrected. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Doctor Manhattan erases Kallor and the Legion from existence before eventually restoring them.

==Powers and abilities==
Star Boy can temporarily increase the mass and density of any object or person. The version of Thom working with the Justice Society of America can travel between universes using a combination of his mass-controlling powers and his uniform, a map of the multiverse created by Brainiac 5.

As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Thom has a Legion Flight Ring, which enables him to fly and survive in space and other dangerous environments.

<doc id="480872" wikidata="Q732355" url="?curid=480872" title="Baron Farnham">
<text>Baron Farnham, of Farnham in the County of Cavan, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1756 for John Maxwell, who had previously represented Cavan Borough in the Irish House of Commons. John Maxwell&#x27;s son, the second Baron, was created Viscount Farnham in 1760 and Earl of Farnham in 1763. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland but became extinct when he died childless in 1779. His brother and successor, the third Baron, was again created Viscount Farnham in 1781 and Earl of Farnham in 1785. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. His son, the second Earl, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1816 to 1823. However, he had no children and on his death in 1823 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.

He was succeeded in the barony by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the eldest son of The Rt Rev. and Hon. Henry Maxwell, Lord Bishop of Meath, third son of the first Baron. Lord Farnham sat as a Member of Parliament for County Cavan and was an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1825 to 1838. His nephew, the seventh Baron (who succeeded his father in 1838), also represented County Cavan in the House of Commons and served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1839 and 1868. Lord Farnham and his wife were killed in the Abergele train disaster of 1868. The title then passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baron, who had earlier represented County Cavan in Parliament. He was succeeded by another brother, the ninth Baron, who also sat as a Member of Parliament for County Cavan. In 1885 he succeeded a distant relative as eleventh Baronet of Calderwood. On his death, the titles passed to his nephew, the tenth Baron. He served as Lord Lieutenant of County Cavan and was briefly an Irish Representative Peer from 1898 until his early death in 1900. His son, the eleventh Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1908 to 1957. the titles are held by his grandson, the thirteenth Baron, who succeeded his elder brother in 2001. Lord Farnham is the son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Somerset Arthur Maxwell. He lives in Oxfordshire in Great Britain.

The Maxwell baronetcy of Calderwood was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1627 for Sir James Maxwell (died ). The 2nd baronet died without issue, and was succeeded by a son of Colonel John Maxwell who died in Dunbar in 1650. The 6th baronet also died without issue, and was succeeded by the son of Alexander Maxwell of Leith, third son of 4th baronet. This line too failed, when his grandson, the tenth Baronet died in 1885. The next holder was the aforementioned 9th Baron, who succeeded as eleventh Baronet. The title passed to the 10th Baron and continued to his descendants.

The Farnhams are remembered in the name of one of the main streets in Cavan town, &quot;Farnham Street&quot;, as well as in the name of a hotel, &quot;The Farnham Arms&quot;, which has the family crest with inscription &quot;Je suis pret&quot; (&quot;I am ready&quot;) above the door.

The family seat was Farnham House, near Cavan, County Cavan.

<text>Murmansk Oblast is a federal subject (an oblast) of Russia, located in the northwestern part of the country, with a total land area of . Its only internal border is the Republic of Karelia to the south, and it is bordered internationally by Finland to the west and Norway to the northwest and the Barents Sea lies to the north and White Sea lies to the south and east. Its administrative center is the city of Murmansk. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 795,409, but at the 2021 Census this had declined to 667,744.

== Geography ==

Geographically, Murmansk Oblast is located mainly on the Kola Peninsula almost completely north of the Arctic Circle and is a part of the larger Sápmi (Lapland) region that spans over four countries. The oblast borders with the Republic of Karelia in Russia in the south, Lapland Region in Finland in the west, Finnmark County in Norway in the northwest, and is bounded by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the south and east. Arkhangelsk Oblast of Russia lies across the White Sea.

Much of the oblast&#x27;s relief is hilly, with the Khibiny and Lovozero ranges rising as high as above sea level and stretching from west to east. The highest point of Murmansk Oblast is Yudychvumchorr, a flat-topped peak of the Khibiny. The north of the oblast is mostly covered by tundra; forest tundra prevails further south, while the southern regions are in the taiga zone. There are over 100,000 lakes and 18,000 rivers in the oblast. The coast contains the Rybachy Peninsula and the Cape Svyatoy Nos peninsulas.

The climate is harsh and unstable, due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream on one side and Arctic cold fronts on the other. Sharp temperature changes, high winds, and abundant precipitation are common throughout the year, with the heating season lasting for ten straight months. However, the waters of the Murman Coast in the south remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.

There is also a large number of islands belonging to the oblast, the main ones being (west to east) the Aynovy Islands, Bolshoy Oleny Island, Kildin Island Malyy Oleniy Island, Kharlov Island, Vesknyak Island, Litskiye Island, Nokuyev Island, Vitte Island, Lumbovskiy Island, Goryainov Island and Sosnovets Island.

*Lake Yurkhyamyayarvi

=== Climate ===

Most areas of the Kola Peninsula are subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfc&quot;). The nearby islands usually belong to tundra (Köppen climate classification: &quot;ET&quot;).


== History ==
The Saami, now a very small minority, are the indigenous people of the region. Russians started exploring the shores of the White Sea as early as in the 12th century, and in 1916 during World War I founded the Russian city of Murmansk as an ice-free supply port.
As of 2010, Murmansk had people – nearly 40% of the oblast&#x27;s population. Many Finns also immigrated to Murmansk during the Finnish famine, around the year 1860.

The oblast was established on May 28, 1938 from Murmansk Okrug of Leningrad Oblast (comprising the city of Murmansk, Kirovsky, Kolsky, Lovozersky, Polyarny, Saamsky, Teribersky, and Tersky Districts) and Kandalakshsky District of the Karelian ASSR.

The area of Pechengsky District (&quot;Petsamo&quot; in Finnish), which was ceded to Finland by the 1920 Treaty of Tartu and gave Finland access to the Barents Sea, became once again part of the RSFSR in 1940. After the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947, the local Saami population was given the choice either of staying in Soviet Russia or resettling in Finland. Most of them chose the second option. On 30 October 1997, Murmansk, alongside Astrakhan, Kirov, Ulyanovsk, and Yaroslavl signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, gaining autonomy. The autonomous status operated until 31 May 2003.

== Politics ==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Murmansk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Murmansk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Murmansk Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter by the Constitution of Russia.

In addition, 28% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 12% is atheist, and 12.5% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
== Economy ==
The Murmansk Oblast is very rich in natural resources and has deposits of over 700 minerals. The main industries of the region are in the sphere of raw material extraction and basic processing. The largest industries are metallurgy (36,6%), electric power-production (22,9%) and food-industry, including fishing (13,7%). The icefree port of Murmansk plays an important role in marine transportation in Russia, and the oblast has a 41% share of the total Russian marine transport market. The fishing industry is among the most profitable in the region, supplying 16% of Russia&#x27;s total fish production. Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia&#x27;s largest, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet.
The economy of the region is export-oriented. Main export items are nickel products, apatite concentrate, copper and copper products, aluminium and ferrous metals. The Murmansk Region produces almost 100 percent of Russia&#x27;s apatite concentrate (3.7 million tons in 1998), 43 percent of nickel, 15 percent of copper, 12 percent of iron ore and iron ore concentrate (17.7 million and 6.4 million tons in 1998), and 40 percent of cobalt.
The largest companies of the region – constituting 90% of the oblast&#x27;s production – are Pechenganickel, Olcon, the Kola Nuclear Power Plant, Sevrybkholodflot, Murmanrybprom, Murmansk Trawl Fleet and Murmansk Shipping Company.

Large oil and gas resources have been discovered on the shelf of the Barents sea, including the massive Shtokman field – one of the world&#x27;s largest gas fields with estimated reserves of 3.8 trillion cubic meters. Prospective oil fields could potentially yield up to 40 million tons in the next 10–15 years. However, the development of the oil and gas resources will require considerable investment.

In 2006, the Murmansk Oblast&#x27;s gross regional product was 141.9 billion rubles, which amounts to about 0.4% of the Russian GDP. Unemployment in 2006 was 3,4%. GRP per capita in 2007 was 225,044 rubles. Regional automobile code is 51.

<doc id="480901" wikidata="Q319159" url="?curid=480901" title="Eala Frya Fresena">
<text>Eala Frya Fresena ( ) is the motto for the coat of arms of East Frisia in northern Germany. The motto is often mistranslated as &quot;Hail, free Frisians!&quot;, but it was the reversal of the feudal prostration and is better translated as &quot;Stand up, free Frisians!&quot;. According to 16th-century sources, it was spoken at the Upstalsboom in Aurich where Frisian judges met on Pentecost and it is traditionally answered with &quot;Lever dood as Slaav&quot;, or in English, &quot;rather dead than slaves&quot;.

The motto refers to the legendary &quot;Frisian Freedom&quot;, a polity and right to accept no rule besides the Holy Roman Emperor and the Christian God. The right was in the Middle Ages supposed to have been granted by Charlemagne for Frisian support of Pope Leo IV (who was not contemporary with Charlemagne). It was said to have been renewed by Charles the Fat in 885 for saving him from Normans. The Frisian freedom basically meant a claim of freedom from tax and fief, to defend themselves against the Normans, Vikings and the northern sea. Friesland offered unclaimed land for everyone, however the unclaimed land of the country was under water half of the day. The daily fight against the northern sea ensured equality of the people who were living on warfs during this time. Tax and fief was therefore replaced by the duty to build dikes.

==History==

The number of Frisian sealands grew from the original seven up to 27 at their height in the early 14th century. Each Frisian sealand sent two seajudges during Pentecost to an annual meeting at the Upstalsboom, to discuss disputes between the tribes. Friesland had a nearly democratic government, unlike most of Europe during Middle Ages. While the seajudges had been delegated to rule legally, the hovedlinge had been self-elected by their wealth to rule the military. Several of them became known for supporting pirates to refinance their wealth. For example, the hoveling Keno ten Broke hosted the famous Klaus Störtebeker.

In the late Middle Ages, Friesland had no central government, but was ruled by either their local chieftains or changing foreign powers. The Frisians revolted often against the foreigners. The Stedinger revolt of 1233–34 caused Pope Gregory IX to call a crusade against them, marking the decline of Frisian freedom. Frisian freedom officially ended in 1498 when Emperor Maximilian I gave Friesland as a fief to Albert, Duke of Saxony to pay a 300,000-guilder debt, but Albert had to conquer Friesland himself first.

== In popular culture ==
The band Eastfrisian Terror, from Emden, Germany, released their debut EP &quot;Lever Dood As Slav&quot;, the third song of which was titled &quot;Eala Frya Fresena&quot;.

<doc id="480905" wikidata="Q2479497" url="?curid=480905" title="Write-in candidate">
<text>A write-in candidate is a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot but seeks election by asking voters to cast a vote for the candidate by physically writing in the person&#x27;s name on the ballot. Depending on electoral law it may be possible to win an election by winning a sufficient number of such write-in votes, which count equally as if the person were formally listed on the ballot.

Writing in a name that is not already on the election ballot is considered a practice of the United States. However, some other jurisdictions have allowed this practice. In the United States, there are variations in laws governing write-in candidates, depending on the office (federal or local) and whether the election is a primary election or the general election; general practice is an empty field close by annotated to explain its purpose on the ballot if it applies. In five U.S. states there are no elections to which it can apply, under their present laws. Election laws are enacted by each state and in the District of Columbia, to apply to their voters.

==How to write in the name==
Some U.S. states and local jurisdictions allow a voter to affix a sticker, with the write-in candidate&#x27;s name, to the ballot in lieu of actually writing in the candidate&#x27;s name.

Write-in candidacies are sometimes a result of a candidate being legally or procedurally ineligible to run under their own name or party; write-in candidacies may be permitted where term limits bar an incumbent candidate from being officially nominated for, or being listed on the ballot for, re-election. They are also typically used when a candidate, often an incumbent, has lost a primary election but still wishes to contest the general election.

In some cases, write-in campaigns have been organized to support a candidate who is not personally involved in running; this may be a form of draft campaign.

==Write-in candidates may have to register as candidates==
Write-in candidates have won elections on rare occasions. Also, write-in votes are sometimes cast for ineligible people or fictional characters, often as a form of protest vote.

Some jurisdictions require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election. This is standard in elections with a large pool of potential candidates, as there may be multiple candidates with the same name that could be written in.

==The spoiler effect==
In some cases, the number of write-in votes cast in an election is greater than the entire margin of victory, suggesting that the write-ins may have been sufficient to tip the balance and change the outcome of the election by creating a spoiler effect.

==Primary elections in the United States==
Many U.S. states and municipalities allow for write-in votes in a partisan primary election where no candidate is listed on the ballot to have the same functional effect as nominating petitions: for example, if there are no Reform Party members on the ballot for state general assembly and a candidate receives more than 200 write-in votes when the primary election is held (or the other number of signatures that were required for ballot access), the candidate will be placed on the ballot on that ballot line for the general election. In most places, this provision is in place for non-partisan elections as well.

==Write-in option in a referendum==
A write-in option may occasionally be available in a multiple-choice referendum; for example in the January 1982 Guamanian status referendum.

==Contrast from a blank ballot election system==

The term &quot;write-in candidate&quot; is used in elections in which names of candidates or parties are preprinted on a paper ballot or displayed on an electronic voting machine. The term is not generally used in elections in which all ballots are blank and thus all voters must write in the names of their preferred candidates. Blank ballot election systems reduce the cost of printing the ballots, but increase the complexity of casting and counting votes. Such systems are used in Japan, and were used in the past in the French Second Republic and in elections in the Philippines from World War II until the 2010 general election. Some systems use a semi-blank ballot, such as Finland, where the voter must fill in a candidate&#x27;s given number or letter from a separate ballot, but where there is a clear-cut arrangement with a circle or box with a description of how to vote for a given candidate. Blank-ballot systems typically require candidates to be nominated in advance.

==United States==
The requirements to appear on the general election ballot as an independent candidate or to have write-in votes counted vary by state and by political office sought.

As of 2024, 40 states and the District of Columbia allow write-in votes on their ballots, including for president; Alaska, New Mexico and South Carolina allow write-in candidates for some offices but not for president; Mississippi allows write-in votes only to substitute a candidate listed on the ballot who was removed, withdrew or died; Arkansas, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma and South Dakota do not allow any write-in votes. Most of the jurisdictions allowing write-in votes require that the write-in candidates register by a certain date for their votes to be counted. Typically this registration consists only of a declaration of candidacy, but some states also require signatures of a certain number of voters, additional paperwork or fees. The deadline to register as a write-in candidate is usually later than to petition to be listed on the ballot.

=== 2024 presidential general election ===

;Notes
=== Presidential primary ===
*In the 1960 presidential elections, both major party candidates won a few primaries as write-in candidates, in contests that did not feature any candidates named on the ballot. John F. Kennedy won the Democratic primaries as a write-in candidate in Illinois (with 34,332 votes), Massachusetts (with 91,607 votes), and Pennsylvania (with 183,073 votes). Richard Nixon won the Republican primaries as a write-in candidate in Massachusetts (with 53,164 votes) and in Nebraska (with 74,356 votes). Kennedy also received write-in votes in the Republican primaries in New Hampshire (2,196 votes, which were 3.0% of votes cast), Massachusetts (2,989 votes, which were 4.8% of votes cast), Pennsylvania (3,886 votes, which were 0.4% of votes cast), and Oregon (2,864 votes, which were 1.3% of votes cast).
*In the 1964 Republican presidential primary, a write-in campaign organized by supporters of former U.S. Senator and vice presidential nominee Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the Republican primaries for president in New Hampshire defeating the frontrunner candidate Barry Goldwater. Lodge also won the Republican presidential primaries in New Jersey as a write-in candidate, as the primaries (for both the Democratic and Republican parties) featured no candidates, with all votes cast requiring candidates&#x27; names be written-in (Lodge also received a handful of votes in the Democratic primary).
*In the 1968 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, incumbent President Lyndon Johnson did not file, but received write-ins totaling 50% of all Democratic votes cast. Senator Eugene McCarthy, who campaigned actively against Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam War policies, was on the ballot. He received 41% of the vote and gained more delegates than the President, who was reportedly &quot;so stunned that he did not run for reelection&quot;.
*In the 1992 Democratic presidential primary and the 1992 Republican presidential primary, consumer advocate Ralph Nader ran a write-in campaign during the New Hampshire primary for the presidential nomination of both parties. Declaring himself the &quot;none of the above candidate&quot; and using his Concord Principles as his platform, Nader received 3,054 votes from Democrats and 3,258 votes from Republicans.
*In the 2024 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary, incumbent president Joe Biden received 79,100 write-in votes, more than any listed candidate. Biden did not run in primary because of a dispute between the Democratic National Committee and the New Hampshire Democratic Party regarding the scheduling of that year&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary. Biden did not support the write-in effort mounted by his supporters.

===U.S. Senate===

*Republican William Knowland was elected in 1946 to the U.S. Senate from California, for a two-month term. The special election for the two-month term featured a November ballot with no names printed on it, and all candidates in that special election were write-in candidates.
*Democrat Strom Thurmond was elected in 1954 to the United States Senate in South Carolina as a write-in candidate, after state Democratic leaders had blocked him from receiving the party&#x27;s nomination.
*In 2010 incumbent Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski lost the Republican primary to Joe Miller. Following her defeat she ran in the general election as a write-in candidate. Murkowski had filed, and won, a lawsuit requiring election officials to have the list of names of write-in candidates distributed at the polls, and subsequently won the election with a wide enough margin over both Miller, and Democratic Party candidate Scott T. McAdams, to make moot the write-in ballots that had been challenged by Miller.
*In 2020, Chris Janicek won the Democratic Senatorial nomination, but during the campaign he sent out sexually inappropriate text messages to staffers causing the Nebraska Democratic Party to withdraw its support from him. The Nebraska Democratic Party attempted to replace Janicek with Alisha Shelton, but Janicek refused to drop out preventing the replacement. Preston Love Jr. later announced his intention to run a write-in senatorial campaign and received the support of the Nebraska Democratic Party, making him the first black person to receive the support of a major party for United States Senate in Nebraska. Both Janicek and Love lost to Republican incumbent Ben Sasse.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
*In 1918, Peter F. Tague was elected to the U.S. House as a write-in independent Democrat, defeating the Democratic nominee, John F. Fitzgerald.
*In 1930 Republican Charles F. Curry Jr. was elected to the House as a write-in from Sacramento, California. His father, Congressman Charles F. Curry Sr., would have been listed on the ballot unopposed but, due to his untimely death, his name was removed and no candidate&#x27;s name was listed on the ballot.
*In 1958, Democrat Dale Alford was elected as a write-in candidate to the United States House of Representatives in Arkansas. As member of the Little Rock school board, Alford launched his write-in campaign a week before the election because the incumbent, Brooks Hays, was involved in the incident in which president Eisenhower sent federal troops to enforce racial integration at Little Rock Central High School. Racial integration was unpopular at the time, and Alford won by approximately 1,200 votes, a 2% margin.
*In 1964 Democrat Gale Schisler was nominated for Congress in Illinois as a write-in candidate when no Democrat filed to run in the primary election. He defeated incumbent Robert McLoskey in the November General Election.
*In November 1980, Republican Joe Skeen was elected to Congress in New Mexico as a write-in candidate, because of a spoiler candidate who also happened to be a write-in. No Republican had filed to run against the incumbent Democrat, Harold L. Runnels, before the close of filing. Runnels died on August 5, 1980, and the Democrats requested a special primary to pick a replacement candidate. The New Mexico Secretary of State allowed the Democrats to have a special primary, but did not allow the Republicans to have a special primary, because they had already gone with no candidate. So Skeen ran as a write-in candidate. After Runnels&#x27; widow lost the Democratic special primary, she launched her own write-in candidacy, which split the Democratic vote, taking enough votes from the Democratic nominee to give the election to the Republican, Skeen, who won with a 38% plurality.
*Ron Packard of California finished in second place in the 18-candidate Republican primary to replace the retiring Clair Burgener. Packard lost the primary by 92 votes in 1982, and then mounted a write-in campaign as an independent. He won the election with a 37% plurality against both a Republican and a Democratic candidate. Following the elections, he re-aligned himself as a Republican.
*Democrat Charlie Wilson was the endorsed candidate of the Democratic Party for Ohio&#x27;s 6th congressional district in Ohio to replace Ted Strickland in 2006. Strickland was running for Governor, and had to give up his congressional seat. Wilson, though, did not qualify for the ballot because only 46 of the 96 signatures on his candidacy petition were deemed valid, while 50 valid signatures were required for ballot placement. The Democratic Party continued to support Wilson, and an expensive primary campaign ensued – over $1 million was spent by both parties. Wilson overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate on May 2, 2006, against two Democratic candidates whose names were on the ballot, with Wilson collecting 44,367 votes, 67% of the Democratic votes cast. Wilson faced Republican Chuck Blasdel in the general election on November 7, 2006, and won, receiving 61% of the votes.
*Democrat Dave Loebsack entered the 2006 Democratic primary in Iowa&#x27;s second congressional district as a write-in candidate after failing to get the required number of signatures. He won the primary and in the general election he defeated 15-term incumbent Jim Leach by a 51% to 49% margin.
*Jerry McNerney ran as a write-in candidate in the March 2004 Democratic Primary in California&#x27;s 11th congressional district. He received 1,667 votes (3% of the votes cast), and, having no opposition (no candidates were listed on the Democratic primary ballot), won the primary. Although he lost the November 2004 general election to Republican Richard Pombo, McNerney ran again in 2006 (as a candidate listed on the ballot) and won the Democratic Primary in June, and then the rematch against Pombo in November.
*Shelley Sekula-Gibbs failed as a write-in candidate in the November 7, 2006, election to represent the 22nd Texas congressional district in the 110th Congress (for the full term commencing January 3, 2007). The seat had been vacant since June 9, 2006, due to the resignation of the then representative Tom DeLay. Therefore, on the same ballot, there were two races: one for the 110th Congress, as well as a race for the unexpired portion of the term during the 109th Congress (until January 3, 2007). Sekula-Gibbs won the race for the unexpired portion of the term during the 109th Congress as a candidate listed on the ballot. She could not be listed on the ballot for the full term because Texas law did not allow a replacement candidate to be listed on the ballot after the winner of the primary (Tom DeLay) has resigned.
*Peter Welch, a Democrat representing Vermont&#x27;s sole congressional district, became both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the House when he ran for re-election in 2008 and 2016. Because the Republicans did not field any candidate on the primary ballot in those elections, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.

===State legislatures===
*Several members of the Alaska House of Representatives were elected as write-in candidates during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly from rural districts in the northern and western portions of the state. Factors in play at the time include the newness of Alaska as a state and the previous absence of electoral politics in many of the rural communities, creating an environment which made it hard to attract candidates to file for office during the official filing period. Most of the areas in question were largely populated by Alaska natives, who held little political power in Alaska at the time. This only began to change following the formation of the Alaska Federation of Natives and the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Known examples of successful write-in candidates include Kenneth A. Garrison and Father Segundo Llorente (1960), Frank R. Ferguson (1972), James H. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Huntington (1974), and Nels A. Anderson Jr. (1976). The incumbent in Llorente&#x27;s election, Axel C. Johnson, ran for re-election as a write-in candidate after failing to formally file his candidacy paperwork. Johnson and Llorente, as write-in candidates, both outpolled the one candidate who did appear on the ballot. Ferguson and Anderson were both incumbents who launched their write-in campaigns after being defeated in the primary election. Anderson&#x27;s main opponent, Joseph McGill, had himself won election to the House in 1970 against a write-in candidate by only five votes.
*Carl Hawkinson of Galesburg, Illinois won the Republican primary for the Illinois Senate from Illinois&#x27;s 47th District in 1986 as a write-in candidate. He went on to be elected in the general election and served until 2003. Hawkinson defeated another write-in, David Leitch, in the primary. Incumbent State Senator Prescott Bloom died in a home fire after the filing date for the primary had passed.
* Arizona state senator Don Shooter won the 2010 primary as a write-in and went on to win the general election.
*After failing to receive the Republican Party&#x27;s 1990 Wilson Pakula nomination, incumbent and registered Conservative New York State Senator Serphin Maltese won the party&#x27;s nomination as a write-in candidate.
*Charlotte Burks won as a Democratic write-in candidate for the Tennessee Senate seat left vacant when the incumbent, her husband Tommy, was assassinated by his opponent, Byron Looper, two weeks before the elections of November 2, 1998. The assassin was the only name on the ballot, so Charlotte ran as a write-in candidate.
*Winnie Brinks was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2012 after a series of unusual events. In May of that year, State Representative Roy Schmidt – who had previously filed to run for re-election as a Democrat – withdrew from the Democratic primary and re-filed as a Republican. A friend of Schmidt&#x27;s nephew filed to run as a Democrat, but withdrew two days later amid anger among local Democrats. This left Democrats without a candidate. Brinks ran as a write-in to be the Democratic nominee. She won the primary and was listed on the ballot in the general election, which she also won. Coincidentally, the general election also saw a write-in candidate, Bing Goei, receive significant support.
*Scott Wagner was elected as an anti-establishment Republican write-in candidate to the Pennsylvania Senate in a March 2014 special election over endorsed Republican nominee Ron Miller and Democrat Linda Small.
*Nick Freitas was re-elected as a write-in candidate after missing a filing deadline to appear on the ballot in the Virginia House of Delegates.
*In November 2024, Scott Madon won the election as a write-in candidate for the Kentucky State Senate. The incumbent state senator, Johnnie Turner, died two weeks before the election. Madon was one of 11 write-in candidates who ran to replace the late Turner, and he won with more the double the votes of his nearest rival.

===Local government===
* Angela Allen was elected mayor of Tar Heel, North Carolina (population 115), as a write-in candidate in 2003.
* Julia Allen of Readington, New Jersey, won a write-in campaign in the November 2005 elections for the Township Committee, after a candidate accused of corruption had won the primary.
* Tom Ammiano, President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, entered the race for mayor of San Francisco as a write-in candidate two weeks before the 1999 general election. He received 25% of the vote, coming in second place and forcing incumbent Mayor Willie Brown into a runoff election, which Brown won by margin of 59% to 40%. In 2001, the campaign was immortalized in the award-winning documentary film &quot;See How They Run&quot;.
* John R. Brinkley ran as a write-in candidate for governor of Kansas in 1930. He was motivated at least in part by the state&#x27;s revocation of his medical license and attempts to shut down his clinic, where he performed alternative medical procedures including transplantation of goat glands into humans. He won 29.5% of the vote in a three-way race. Brinkley&#x27;s medical and political career are documented in Pope Brock&#x27;s book &quot;Charlatan&quot;.
* Mike Duggan filed petition to run for mayor of Detroit in 2013; however, following a court challenge, Duggan&#x27;s name was removed from the ballot. Duggan then campaigned as a write-in in the August 2013 primary, with the intent of being one of the top two vote-getters and thus advancing to the general election in November. Duggan received the highest number of votes in the primary, and advanced to the runoff in November. He eventually defeated challenger Sheriff Benny Napoleon and became the mayor of Detroit.
* Donna Frye ran as a write-in candidate for mayor of San Diego in 2004. A controversy erupted when several thousand votes for her were not counted because the voters had failed to fill in the bubble next to the write-in line. Had those votes been counted, she would have won the election.
* Michael Jarjura was re-elected mayor of Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2005 as a write-in candidate after losing the Democratic party primary to Karen Mulcahy, who used to serve as Waterbury&#x27;s tax collector before Jarjura fired her in 2004 &quot;for what he claimed was her rude and abusive conduct toward citizens&quot;. After spending $100,000 on a general elections write-in campaign, Jarjura received 7,907 votes, enough for a plurality of 39%.
* James Maher won the mayorship of Baxter Estates, New York, on March 15, 2005, as a write-in candidate with 29 votes. Being the only one on the ballot, the incumbent mayor, James Neville, did not campaign, as he did not realize that there was a write-in campaign going on. Neville received only 13 votes.
* Beverly O&#x27;Neil won a third term as Mayor of Long Beach, California, as a write-in candidate in 2002. The Long Beach City City Charter has a term limit amendment that says a candidate cannot be on the ballot after two full terms, but does not prevent the person from running as a write-in candidate. She finished first in a seven-candidate primary, but did not receive more than 50% of the vote, forcing a runoff contest. In the runoff, still restricted from the ballot, she got roughly 47% of the vote in a three-way election that included a second write-in candidate.
* Michael Sessions, an 18-year-old high school senior, won as a write-in candidate for Mayor of Hillsdale, Michigan, in 2005. He was too young to qualify for the ballot.
* In 2021, Byron Brown, the incumbent mayor of Buffalo, New York, defeated Democratic challenger India Walton in the general election, by running a successful write-in campaign after losing the Democratic primary to Walton.
* In Galesburg, Illinois, an error by the Galesburg Election Commission in late 2010 gave city council candidate Chuck Reynolds the wrong number of signatures he required to be on the ballot for the April 2011 city council election, resulting in his removal from the ballot when challenged by incumbent Russell Fleming. Reynolds ran as a write-in vote in the April 2011 election, and lost by nine votes.
* Anthony A. Williams, then incumbent Mayor of Washington, D.C., was forced to run as a write-in candidate in the 2002 Democratic primary, because he had too many invalid signatures for his petition. He won the Democratic primary, and went on to win re-election.
* In the November 8, 2011, election for Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney of Richmond County, Virginia, 16-year incumbent Wayne Emery was certified the winner as a write-in candidate over challenger James Monroe by a margin of 53 votes (2.4%) out of 2,230 votes cast, after his petitions were challenged and his name was removed from the ballot.
* In the August 4, 2020, primary election of Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, Monica Ross-Williams, a then Ypsilanti Township Trustee, received 3,478 write-in votes for Ypsilanti Township Clerk, for the highest number of write-in votes in any election in Washtenaw County, Michigan history.
* In the 1997 election for Mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, Stubbs the Cat won over the two human candidates. He was re-elected every mayoral election thereafter, and served until his death on July 2, 2017.
* In 2011, in Pacific, Washington, Marine veteran Cy Sun ousted incumbent mayor Rich Hildreth as a write-in candidate, using a comprehensive ground game in the small town to convince locals to support him over Hildreth, whom he accused of corruption. After the election, the county elections office reported that a sufficient number of write-ins votes had made it possible that a write-in could win, and after a count of the write-ins, Sun beat Hildreth by 464 to 401. Sun&#x27;s mayorship was plagued by political and physical challenges, and Sun would be recalled in 2013.
* Eau Claire County, Wisconsin sheriff Ron Cramer, formerly a sheriff&#x27;s deputy, won election as Eau Claire County&#x27;s 47th sheriff, defeating disgraced 10-year incumbent sheriff Richard M. Hewitt in a write-in campaign hastily organized just weeks before the election in 1996. He has handily won reelection every four years since, usually running unopposed.
* Lynda Neuwirth defeated the lone candidate on the ballot, Joseph DiPasquale, for the Ellicottville, New York village justice position on March 19, 2019; Neuwirth received three votes to DiPasquale&#x27;s two. Neuwirth was ousted after only two months in the position, as voters had approved a referendum abolishing the court the previous November; when the abolition was delayed two months, Neuwirth was not allowed to retain her seat and was replaced by a justice from the surrounding town, which will absorb the village court&#x27;s jurisdiction.
* Lon Lafferty won as a write-in for the Martin County, Kentucky Judge Executive election in 2022, defeating four other write-in candidates—Marlena Slone, Jimmy Don Kerr, Benjamin York and Mitchell Crum—with approximately 60% of the vote. This election was solely decided by write-in—the first election in Martin County&#x27;s history in which all of the candidates were write-ins—after the previous Judge Executive, Colby Kirk, resigned from office and withdrew his candidacy three weeks before the election to take over as President/CEO of economic development organization One East Kentucky. (Governor Andy Beshear had appointed Lafferty to fill the seat for the remaining two months of Kirk&#x27;s term.)

===Other elections===
*Aaron Schock was elected to the District 150 School Board in Peoria, Illinois, in 2001 by a write-in vote, after his petitions were challenged and his name was removed from the ballot. He defeated the incumbent by over 2,000 votes, approximately 6,400 to 4,300 votes. He went on to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives, and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2008. He was later forced to resign in an expenses scandal.
*John Adams became an Orange County, California judge in November 2002 after running along with 10 other write-in candidates in the primaries on March 5, 2002, against incumbent Judge Ronald Kline. After the filing deadline in which no candidate filed to run against Kline, a computer hacker discovered that Judge Kline had child pornography on his home computer. Kline got less than 50% of the vote in the primaries, requiring a runoff between him and write-in candidate John Adams (who actually received more votes than Kline). After some legal maneuvers, Kline&#x27;s name was removed from the general elections, leaving the general election a runoff between Adams and Gay Sandoval, who was the second highest write-in vote getter. Charges against Kline were eventually thrown out.
*On September 15, 2009, four write-in candidates in the Independence Party primaries for various offices in Putnam County, New York, defeated their on-ballot opponents.
*In a May 2011 school board election for the Bentley School Board in Michigan, Lisa Osborn ran as a write-in candidate and needed just one vote to win a seat. However, she did not receive any votes, even from herself. She explained herself by saying that she was at her son&#x27;s baseball game and did not have time to go to the polls.

===California&#x27;s Proposition 14 impact on write-in candidates===
In 2010, California voters passed Proposition 14 which set up a new election system for the United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, all statewide offices (governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, state controller, attorney general, insurance commissioner, and superintendent of public instruction), California Board of Equalization, and for the California State Legislature. In the system set up by Proposition 14, there are two rounds of voting, and the top two vote-getters for each race in the first round (the primary, held in June 2004 – 2018 and March 2020–present) advance to a second round (the general election, held in November). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round, and this prohibition was upheld in a court challenge. Another court challenge to the prohibition on write-in candidates in the second round was filed in July 2014.

Although Proposition 14 prohibits write-in candidates in the second round of voting, it has created conditions that can make it easier for write-in candidates in the first round to advance to the second round. This generally happens in elections where only one candidate is listed on the ballot. Since in each race the top two vote-getters from the first round are guaranteed to advance to the second round, if only one candidate is listed on the ballot, a write-in candidate can easily advance to the second round, as the write-in candidate would only have to compete with other write-in candidates for the second spot, not with any listed candidates. In some jungle primary systems, if the winner in the first round wins by more than 50% of the vote, then the second (runoff) round gets cancelled, but in the system set up by Proposition 14, a second (runoff) round is required regardless of the percent of the vote that the winner of the first round received. Proposition 14 therefore guarantees that if only one candidate is listed on the ballot in the first round, a write-in candidate running against the one listed candidate can earn a spot for the second round with as little as one vote.

The first election in which Proposition 14 went into effect was the 2012 elections.
==Other countries==
With a few exceptions, the practice of recognizing write-in candidates is typically viewed internationally as a tradition in the United States.

*A bizarre incident involving a fictitious write-in candidacy occurred in the small town of Picoazá, Ecuador, in 1967. A company ran a series of campaign-themed advertisements for a foot powder called Pulvapies. Some of the slogans used included &quot;Vote for any candidate, but if you want well-being and hygiene, vote for Pulvapies&quot;, and &quot;For Mayor: Honorable Pulvapies&quot;. The foot powder Pulvapies ended up receiving the most votes in the election.
*In Brazil, until the introduction of electronic voting in 1994, the ballot had no names written for legislative candidates, so many voters would protest by voting on fictional characters or religious figures. In a famous case, the São Paulo city zoo rhinoceros &quot;Cacareco&quot; got around 100,000 votes in the 1959 elections for the municipal council, more than any candidate. However, those votes were not considered because Brazilian law stipulates that a candidate must be affiliated to a political party to take office.
* Until 2013, write-in candidates were permitted at municipal elections in France for councils of communes with a population of less than 2500.
* Elections in Sweden are open list, with voters placing into the ballot box an envelope containing their choice of either a ballot preprinted with the name of a registered party or else a blank ballot on which they write the name of a party (registered or unregistered) and optionally that of a candidate. A person must consent to being a candidate listed on a preprinted ballot, but there was no such obligation for write-in names until the 2018 general election. In the 2006 municipal elections, the Sweden Democrats (SD) won seats on several councils where they had no nominee or preprinted ballots; most SD voters wrote the party name but no candidate name. The seats were filled by the name most often written, if any, and left empty if no voter wrote in a name. One example was Vårgårda Municipality, where only 3 of 143 SD voters wrote in names, of which two were for an ineligible non-resident; the winner resigned his seat as he opposed the SD and his sole vote was cast by his father as a joke. In 2010 one Jimmy Åkesson was elected to Staffanstorp Municipality council after a single SD voter wrote his name. The voter apparently intended SD leader Jimmie Åkesson, not resident in Staffanstorp.
* In elections in Austria, writing on a ballot paper does not invalidate a vote provided the voter&#x27;s preference is clear. In the 1990 legislative election the unpopular SPÖ, worried that voters would not select it on the party-list ballot, advised them to write in the name of Franz Vranitzky, its popular leader. Such ballots would be interpreted as SPÖ votes.
* In many German federal states, it is possible to write people on the ballot paper by hand in municipal council elections or mayoral elections if only one person is running or if the number of candidates is lower than the number of seats in the municipal council (″Einzelvorschlag″).

==Protest==
*In United States elections, write-in votes are sometimes cast for fictional characters, notably Mickey Mouse, whose name usage as a protest vote has been attested since 1932.
*&quot;Mad&quot; magazine satirically called to vote for Alfred E. Neuman as a write-in candidate for every U.S. presidential election from 1956 to 1980 with slogans like &quot;You could do worse– you always have!&quot; and &quot;There are bigger idiots running for office!&quot;.
*In the 1980 U.S. presidential election, guitarist Joe Walsh ran a mock write-in campaign, promising to make his song &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot; the new national anthem if he won, and running on a platform of &quot;Free Gas for Everyone&quot;. Though Walsh (then aged 33) was not old enough to actually assume the office, he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. (In 1992, Walsh purportedly ran for &quot;vice&quot;-president, in his song &quot;Vote For Me&quot;, a track on his album &quot;Songs for a Dying Planet&quot;, which was released that year.)
*During the 2000 United States Congress Elections, film-maker Michael Moore led a campaign for voters to submit a ficus tree as a write-in candidate. This campaign was replicated across the country and was recounted in an episode of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;.
*In 2012, a campaign was waged to write in Charles Darwin against Georgia congressman Paul Broun (who was running unopposed) after Broun &quot;called evolution and other areas of science &#x27;lies straight from the pit of hell. Darwin received approximately 4,000 votes. However, because Darwin was not registered as an official candidate (some states require even write-ins to be pre-registered), the Georgia Secretary of State did not tabulate those votes.
*In 2016, several grassroots campaigns to elect Bernie Sanders President as a write-in candidate were established on social media in the run-up to the United States presidential election. Though Sanders continued to campaign for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, supporters pointed to alleged DNC bias in the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential primaries against Sanders, and Clinton&#x27;s email scandal, and continued to support him. Both Clinton and Donald Trump would have had to win less than the required 270 electoral college votes for Sanders to have denied either candidate the presidency, and for the election to be passed to the House of Representatives – thus the initial write-in campaign around Vermont, offering only three college votes, was not successful, but Sanders did receive almost six percent of the vote there. The campaign expanded to include all 12 eligible states (one of which listed Sanders as an official write-in candidate), and relied on states such as California, with a high electoral college vote count and large support for Sanders, to be successful in denying both Trump and Clinton.
* In Sweden, all handwritten votes are scanned by computer and the results published online, although only votes for valid parties count towards determining successful candidates. In the 2010 general election, ineffective votes included 120 for Donald Duck and 2 for &quot;myself&quot;, as well as several computer code snippets apparently intended as code injection attacks aimed at either the program which tallied the votes or the browsers of users who accessed the results website.
* In the 2018 Egyptian presidential election, owing to a large number of candidates being arrested or barred from running, Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah received over a million votes, as many Egyptians cancelled out the names of both candidates and wrote his instead. This was higher than the number of votes received by the second place candidate, Moussa Mostafa Moussa. Write-in votes are not deemed valid in Egypt.

<text>Joseph Fielding Smith Jr. (July 19, 1876 – July 2, 1972) was an American religious leader and writer who served as the tenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1970 until his death in 1972. He was the son of former church president Joseph F. Smith and the great-nephew of church founder Joseph Smith.

Smith was named to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1910, when his father was the church&#x27;s president. When Smith became president of the church, he was 93 years and 6 months old; he began his presidential term at an older age than any other president in church history. Smith&#x27;s tenure as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1951 to 1970 is the third-longest in church history; he served in that capacity during the entire presidency of David O. McKay.

Smith spent some of his years as an apostle as the Church Historian and Recorder. He was a religious scholar and a prolific writer. Many of his works are used as references for church members. Doctrinally, Smith was known for rigid orthodoxy and as an arch-conservative in his views on evolution and race, although it has been said that age had softened him and as a result he put up less resistance to reforms by the time he had become president.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, on July 19, 1876, as the first son of Julina Lambson Smith, the second wife and first plural wife of Joseph F. Smith, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. By agreement between his parents, Smith was given his father&#x27;s name, even though Joseph F. Smith&#x27;s third and fourth wives had previously had sons. Growing up, Smith lived in his father&#x27;s large family home at 333 West 100 North in Salt Lake City. The house was opposite the original campus of the University of Deseret (modern University of Utah), on a site now occupied by Ensign College. He also often worked on the family farm in Taylorsville, Utah, as a child.

In January 1879, when Smith was two years old, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; upheld the constitutionality of the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862, which had criminalized the Mormon practice of plural marriage. Due to aggressive federal enforcement of this ruling, as well as the Edmunds Act of 1882 and the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887, many LDS Church leaders, including Smith&#x27;s father, were either imprisoned or forced into hiding and exile during most of the 1880s. Smith&#x27;s father, as the keeper of the records of the Endowment House, felt a special need to avoid capture since the records could allow the federal authorities to easily prove polygamy charges against certain Latter-day Saint men. In January 1885, Smith&#x27;s parents and his younger sister, Julina, left for the Sandwich Islands (modern Hawaii), where Smith&#x27;s father had served a mission as a teenager in the 1850s. In their absence, Smith continued to live in the family home with his brothers and sisters and his father&#x27;s other wives, whom he &quot;lovingly called &#x27;aunties&#x27;&quot;. Smith&#x27;s mother returned to Salt Lake City in 1887, followed later by his father. Even after his return, Joseph F. Smith was unable to openly visit and care for his wives and children until receiving a presidential pardon from U.S. President Benjamin Harrison in September 1891.

Smith&#x27;s mother worked as a midwife to help provide for the family, and delivered nearly 1,000 babies in her career without ever having a mother or infant die in childbirth. As a boy, Smith often drove his mother by wagon to the various deliveries that she attended in Salt Lake City. Smith&#x27;s primary schooling took place in &quot;ward schools&quot;, which in the 19th century were semi-formal schools run by members of each ward which taught the traditional &quot;three R&#x27;s&quot;: reading, writing, and arithmetic. As a teenager Smith completed two years of study at the Latter-day Saint College, an institution equivalent to the modern U.S. high school, which provided courses in the basic areas of mathematics, geography, history, basic science, and penmanship. After leaving the college, Smith began working as a stock clerk doing manual labor at ZCMI to supplement the family&#x27;s income. Smith was present in the large assembly room of the Salt Lake Temple for its dedication on April 6, 1893, by church president Wilford Woodruff.

==Family and personal life==
Smith married his first wife, Louie Emily &quot;Emyla&quot; Shurtliff (born June 16, 1876) on April 26, 1898. In March 1899, church president Lorenzo Snow called him on a mission to Great Britain, which he completed (May 1899 - July 1901), leaving Louie in Salt Lake City. On May 12, 1899, Smith was set apart as a missionary and ordained a seventy by his father. A small group of missionaries, including Smith and his older brother, Joseph Richards Smith, left the next day for England. After his return from the British mission, Smith and his wife had two daughters, Josephine and Julina. Louie died of complications of a third pregnancy on March 28, 1908. For part of this time Smith was a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, including time with Evan Stephens as conductor.

Smith married Ethel Georgina Reynolds (born October 23, 1889), the daughter of prominent LDS Church leader George Reynolds, on November 2, 1908. They had four girls (Emily, Naomi, Lois, and Amelia) and five boys (Joseph Fielding (often called Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr.), Lewis Warren, George Reynolds, Douglas Allan, and Milton Edmund). Their youngest daughter, Amelia, married Bruce R. McConkie, who was named to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shortly after Smith&#x27;s death. Ethel died of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 26, 1937, at age 47.

Ethel had specifically requested that Jessie Ella Evans (December 29, 1902 – August 2, 1971) sing at her funeral. Evans, born to Jonathan Evans and Janet Buchanan Evans, had joined the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 1918, was a member of the American Light Opera Company (1923–27), and was the Salt Lake County Recorder. In November 1937, Evans and Smith were engaged to be married.

In April 12, 1938, Smith married Evans in the Salt Lake Temple. The marriage was performed by Heber J. Grant. The couple had no children and Jessie died on August 2, 1971.

==Church service==

After completing his mission in 1901, Smith began working in the office of the Church Historian and Recorder. In 1906, he was given the position of Assistant Church Historian. He wrote his first doctrinal book, &quot;The Origins of the Reorganized Church and the Question of Succession&quot; in 1909, to defend the LDS Church against the recent proselytizing by missionaries for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) in Utah. He was the acting recorder of the 1910 general conference when he was called as an apostle. Prior to his call as a general authority, Smith served as the secretary and treasurer of the Genealogical Society of Utah. In 1921, Smith assumed the office of Church Historian and Recorder, which he held until 1970.

Before 1910, Smith was a member of a stake high council and a home missionary (somewhat similar to a modern ward missionary). He also served on the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association General Board.

Early in his apostleship, his creationist views on the dispute between Mormonism&#x27;s Biblical teachings and the theory of evolution brought him attention. (See Mormonism and evolution.) Smith authored the book &quot;Man, His Origin and Destiny&quot; on the subject and unsuccessfully tried to make it the basis of a course of study at the church seminaries. The book was met with disapproval from church president David O. McKay, who made it clear that the book was unauthorized by the church and was not to be taken as reflecting church doctrine. However, because Smith was the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the time of publication and later became president of the church, his views carried substantial weight with the general church membership and grew to be accepted by a significant portion.

Smith lived most of his time as an apostle in Salt Lake City. He also was president of the Salt Lake Temple from 1945 to 1949. During this time, Smith was sent on a tour of the church&#x27;s Spanish-American Mission. Before his return to Salt Lake City, he informed the president of the Arizona Temple that he would recommend to the First Presidency that the temple ceremonies be translated into Spanish.

Smith served as president of the Genealogical Society of Utah and its successor the Genealogical Society of the LDS Church from 1934 to 1961. At the time of his release from this position, he had been President of the Quorum of the Twelve for over a decade. During the late 1950s, Smith attempted to reduce staff turnover at the Society by trying to convince the First Presidency that women should be permitted to stay on as employees after they married. However, Smith was only able to get a change to allow them to work six months past marriage.

In early 1961, Smith preached to a stake conference congregation in Hawaii:
We will never get a man into space. This earth is man&#x27;s sphere and it was never intended that he should get away from it. The moon is a superior planet to the earth and it was never intended that man should go there. You can write it down in your books that this will never happen.

Earlier, Smith had written that &quot;it is doubtful that man will ever be permitted to make any instrument or ship to travel through space and visit the moon or any distant planet&quot;. At the 1970 press conference where Smith was introduced as President of the LDS Church, he was asked about these statements; Smith reportedly responded, &quot;Well, I was wrong, wasn&#x27;t I?&quot;

Smith&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2014 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

===Service abroad===
Smith did at times take church assignments abroad. In 1939, he toured the missions in Europe and supervised the withdrawal of missionaries as World War II began. In 1950 Smith toured the church&#x27;s Mexican Mission. In July and August 1955 he made an extensive tour of Asia, during which he dedicated Korea and the Philippines for the preaching of the gospel. In 1957 he went to Europe for the dedication of the London Temple and also presided over the excommunication of several missionaries in the French mission who had apostatized. From October 1960 to January 1961 he and Jessie toured the church missions in Central and South America.

==Writings==
The first book Smith published was &quot;Asael Smith of Topsfield, Massachusetts, with some Account of the Smith Family&quot; (1902). In all, Smith published 25 books.

==Church president==
Smith became LDS Church&#x27;s president on January 23, 1970, following the death of David O. McKay. He chose Harold B. Lee and N. Eldon Tanner as his counselors. Smith elected not to retain Hugh B. Brown in the First Presidency. According to Church Historian Leonard J. Arrington, Smith&#x27;s age and health prevented him from having much of a supervising role during his presidency; most work was done by his two counselors.

Although he served as church president for less than three years, Smith&#x27;s administration introduced several new initiatives: Area conferences were introduced, significant organizational restructuring in the church&#x27;s Sunday School system and the church&#x27;s Department of Social Services occurred, and the church magazines were consolidated into the &quot;Ensign&quot;, &quot;New Era&quot; and &quot;Friend&quot; in English, with centralized planning for all publications. His tenure was also marked by steady growth in the number of missionaries, and the dedication of temples in Ogden and Provo, Utah.

==Death==
Smith died at his home in Salt Lake City on July 2, 1972, at age 95. He attended church services with his ward that day, and while visiting with one of his daughters that evening he quietly died while sitting in his favorite chair. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<text>Kursk Oblast (, ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Kursk. As of the 2021 census, Kursk Oblast had a population of 1,082,458.

==History==

The territory of Kursk Oblast has been populated since the end of the last ice age. Slavic tribes of the Severians inhabited the area. From 830 the current Kursk Oblast was part of the Rus&#x27; Khaganate and Kievan Rus&#x27; states. The oldest towns in the region are Kursk and Rylsk, first mentioned in 1032 and 1152, respectively, both capitals of small medieval eponymous duchies. In the 13th century, the region was conquered by the Mongol Empire.

In the 15th century it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under the Jagiellonian dynasty. It was lost in the 16th-century Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. A real growth of the area around Kursk began soon after that, with a large migration from Central Russia after the Russian famine of 1601–1603. The region was affected by Crimean–Nogai slave raids in the 16th and 17th centuries. The current southwestern outskirts of the oblast with the town of Sudzha were part of Sloboda Ukraine and populated by Ukrainians since the mid-17th century. Between 1708 and 1719, Kursk was part of the newly created Kiev Governorate. From 1719 to 1727, it was a part of Belgorodsky Uyezd of Kiev Governorate. From 1727, Kursky Uyezd was part of Belgorod Governorate. On 23 May 1779, Kursk Governorate was established.

During World War I and the Russian Civil War, in 1918, it was the site of fights of anti-Bolshevik Ukrainians and Germans against Soviet Russia. In 1918, the western portion of the current Kursk Oblast with the towns of Rylsk and Sudzha was part of the Ukrainian State. Korenevo was the place of signing of a ceasefire between the Ukrainian State, Germany and Soviet Russia in May 1918. Kursk was the place of establishment of the Provisional Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Government of Ukraine, and Sudzha was its first seat in November-December 1918. Sudzha remained part of Soviet Ukraine until 1922.

The Kursk Governorate existed until 1928, when the territory of Kursk Governorate became a part of Central Black Earth Oblast. As Central Chernozem Oblast was very large its administration was very difficult, on 13 June 1934 it was divided into two oblasts: Kursk Oblast and Voronezh Oblast. In the period between 1934 and 1954, oblasts&#x27; borders were frequently adjusted. However, the area and borders of the oblast have remained stable from 1954.

During World War II, the territory of Kursk Oblast was occupied by German troops from the autumn of 1941 until the summer of 1943. The Battle of Kursk, which was one of the major battles of World War II, took place in the region between 5 July 1943 and 23 August 1943.

The 4th leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, was born in Kalinovka, a village that is now part of the Kursk Oblast.

As of 2024, the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod pipeline in Sudzha was the last remaining point through which natural gas flowed from Russia to Europe via Ukraine.

In August 2024, Ukrainian forces crossed the border into Kursk Oblast during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine resulting in a small part of the oblast coming under Ukrainian occupation.

==Geography==

Kursk Oblast is bordered by Bryansk Oblast to the north-west (border length: ), Oryol Oblast to the north (), Lipetsk Oblast to the north-east (), Voronezh Oblast to the east (), Belgorod Oblast to the south (), and Sumy Oblast of Ukraine to the west ().

The average elevation is and the Timsko-Shchigrinsky ridge contains the highest point at above sea level. The low relief, gentle slopes, and mild winters make the area suitable for farming, and much of the forest has been cleared. Chernozem soils cover around 70% of the oblast, and podsol soils 26%; chernozem is among the best soils for agriculture, and podsol among the worst. 

Kursk Oblast contributes to two major drainage areas: the Dnieper River and the Don River (78% and 22% respectively).

The inland waters of Kursk oblast consist of 145 artificial lakes and about 550 small ponds.

===Natural resources===

Kursk Oblast is one of Russia&#x27;s major producers of iron ore. The area of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly has one of the richest iron-ore deposits in the world. Rare earths and base metals also occur in commercial quantities in several locations. Refractory loam, mineral sands, and chalk are quarried and processed in the region. The oblast&#x27;s reserves of artesian-well water are proving useful for medical purposes.

===Climate===
The oblast&#x27;s location at the center of the European part of Russia gives the region a medium continental climate: warm summers and relatively mild winters. In July the average daytime high temperature is . In January the average high is . The average number of frost-free days ranges from 150 in the north to 160 in the south.

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kursk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991, CPSU lost power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Kursk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Kursk Oblast Duma is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

The oblast&#x27;s industrial production dropped rapidly during the 1990s, as an industrial crisis was stimulated by the nationwide economic crisis which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, by the end of the decade output was increasing. Moreover, the manufacturing sector, despite a sagging economy in the late 20th century, continues to account for about 40% of the oblast&#x27;s GDP. The engineering, electric-power, metal-working, chemicals, and food processing are the dominant industries.

The Mikhailovsky Mining Plant is one of the largest iron ore mining and processing facilities in Russia.

The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is one of the three biggest nuclear power plants in Russia and one of the four biggest electricity producers in the country.

<text>Lipetsk Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Lipetsk. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 1,143,224.

==Geography==
Lipetsk Oblast borders with Ryazan Oblast (NE), Tambov Oblast (E), Voronezh Oblast (S), Kursk Oblast (SW), Oryol Oblast (W), and Tula Oblast (NW).

==History==
According to archaeologists and historians, the territory of the modern Lipetsk Oblast has been inhabited since ancient times. Even before the arrival of the Mongol-Tatar troops, the area had the following settlements: Yelets, Dobrinsk (presumed to be the village of Dobroye) Dubok (presumed to be the village Dubki) (Dankovsky District), Staroye Gorodische (presumably Bogorodskoye of the Dankovsky district) Vorgol (destroyed), Onuza (destroyed), Voronozh (destroyed), Lipets (destroyed) and others. During the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, many fortified cities were destroyed.

At the beginning of the period belonged to the disintegration of the Principality of Chernigov. After 1202, after the fall of Chernigov, Prince Igor Svyatoslavich Yelets arose, Lipetsk and Vorgolskoe fiefdoms. Taking advantage of the weakness of the Principality of Chernigov, Ryazan princes seized all the lands of the upper Don, Voronezh River and annexed them. The newly acquired territories in the south of the Ryazan principality subsequently used the name &quot;Ryazan Ukraine.&quot;

The revival of the territory began after the expulsion of the nomads. In a relatively short period of time (end of the 16th and early 17th centuries) were built fortified city: Duncan Talitskii jail, Eletskaya fortress Lebedian. In 1635, construction began on a strong fortified line - Belgorod defense line, which in the Lipetsk region within a modern fortress stood out: Good, Sokolsk and Usman.

Near the plants have populations of workers. One of these settlements was working Lipetsk settlement that gave rise to the city of Lipetsk.

At this time, because of the creation of the Navy and the regular army increased the need for flax, hemp and wool. So begins to actively develop agriculture.

The 18th century saw the continued growth of large land estates. Lipetsk region, with its rich black earth, was the breadbasket of the Russian state. Subsequently, it became widely known as a resort town, mainly because of its mineral waters.

During the February Revolution, the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War, the lives of many cultural values, private collections of art and literature, but because of the ensuing repression against the church and the &quot;bourgeois past&quot; seriously affected the architectural ensembles of the estates of the nobility, monasteries and churches.

==Politics==

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Lipetsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The current head of the Council of Deputies is Pavel Putilin.

The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official, who is elected by the Oblast&#x27;s inhabitants for a five year term and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

Since 2019, the Governor is Igor Artamonov.

<doc id="480921" wikidata="Q4862570" url="?curid=480921" title="Baron Lisle">
<text>Baron Lisle was a title which was created five times in the Peerage of England during the Middle Ages and Tudor period, and once in the Peerage of Ireland in the 18th century.

==First creation (of Wootton), (1299–1311/14)==

The earliest creation was in 1299 for Sir John I Lisle, of Wootton on the Isle of Wight, then in Hampshire. The family&#x27;s name in French was &quot;de l&#x27;Isle&quot; and in Latin &quot;de Insula&quot;, both meaning &quot;of the Island&quot;, though some texts refer to them as &quot;de Bosco&quot; from their home at Wootton. They are assumed to have arrived on the Isle of Wight as followers of the magnate Richard de Redvers (died 1107), who was Lord of the Isle of Wight and father of Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon. After the de Redvers family, that of Lisle was the most important on the Island.

Sir John I Lisle was summoned to Parliament by writs from 29 December 1299 to 13 September 1302 and died shortly before 10 June 1304. His son and heir Sir John II Lisle was summoned from 12 November 1304 to 19 December 1311 (or possibly 29 July 1314). As no further summons arrived for the rest of his life, and no lawful descendant was ever summoned, the barony expired.

==Second creation (of Rougemont), (1311)==
The barony of 1311 was created for De Lisle &quot;of Rougemont&quot;, another unrelated family, thought to have originated on the Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire, East Anglia, where they were feudal tenants of the Bishop of Ely, They were seated at Rougemont Castle in the parish of Weeton, North Yorkshire and bore arms: &quot;Or, a fess between two chevrons sable&quot;.

==Third creation (of Kingston Lisle), (1357)==
The barony of 1357 was for Lisle &quot;of Kingston Lisle&quot; in the parish of Sparsholt in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire), a junior branch of Lisle of Rougemont. Robert de Lisle of Rougemont married Alice FitzGerold (granddaughter of Henry FitzGerold I (d.1173/4)), the heiress of Kingston, Sparsholt. In 1269 Alice granted the manor of Kingston to her younger son Gerard I de Lisle, whose family adopted the arms of FitzGerold: &quot;Gules, a lion statant guardant argent crowned or&quot;. Gerard I&#x27;s grandson was Gerard II de Lisle (1305–1360), created Baron Lisle in 1357.

==Sixth creation (1758)==
The most recent creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1758, when John Lysaght was made Baron Lisle, of Mountnorth in the County of Cork. He had previously represented Charleville in the Irish House of Commons. the title is held by his descendant, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2003. The barony is pronounced &quot;Lyle&quot;, the family surname of Lysaght &quot;Lycett&quot;.

==Barons Lisle, first creation (1299)==
*John Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle (died 1304)
*John Lisle, 2nd Baron Lisle (1281–1337)

==Barons Lisle (of Rougemont), second creation (1311)==
* Robert Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle of Rougemont (1288–1344)
* John Lisle, 2nd Baron Lisle of Rougemont (c. 1318–1355)
* Robert Lisle, 3rd Baron Lisle of Rougemont (1334–1399)
* William de Lisle, 4th Baron Lisle of Rougemont (? - before June 1428)
&quot;[T]he barony presumably fell into abeyance between the issue of the daughters of Robert, 1st Lord Lisle [1311].&quot;

==Barons Lisle (of Kingston Lisle), third creation (1357)==
* Gerard Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle (1305–1360)
* Warin Lisle, 2nd Baron Lisle (1333–1382), son
* Margaret Lisle, 3rd Baroness Lisle (1360–1392), daughter
* Elizabeth Berkeley, 4th Baroness Lisle (c.1386–1422) (abeyant 1422), daughter

==Barons Lisle, fourth creation (1444)==
*John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle (1426–1453) (created Viscount Lisle 1451), grandson
*Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle (1443–1470), son; (viscountcy extinct, barony abeyant 1470)

<text>Electromagnetic radiation can be affected in several ways by the medium in which it propagates.  It can be scattered, absorbed, and reflected and refracted at discontinuities in the medium.  This page is an overview of the last 3. The transmittance of a material and any surfaces is its effectiveness in transmitting radiant energy; the fraction of the initial (incident) radiation which propagates to a location of interest (often an observation location). This may be described by the transmission coefficient.

==Surface Transmittance==
===Hemispherical transmittance===
Hemispherical transmittance of a surface, denoted &quot;T&quot;, is defined as
:formula_1
where
*Φet is the radiant flux &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation;
*Φei is the radiant flux received by that surface.
Hemispheric transmittance may be calculated as an integral over the directional transmittance described below.

===Spectral hemispherical transmittance===
Spectral hemispherical transmittance in frequency and spectral hemispherical transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted &quot;T&quot;ν and &quot;T&quot;λ respectively, are defined as
:formula_2
:formula_3
where
*Φe,νt is the spectral radiant flux in frequency &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation;
*Φe,νi is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that surface;
*Φe,λt is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation;
*Φe,λi is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that surface.

===Directional transmittance===
Directional transmittance of a surface, denoted &quot;T&quot;Ω, is defined as
:formula_4
where
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ωt is the radiance &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface into the solid angle Ω;
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ωi is the radiance received by that surface.

===Spectral directional transmittance===
Spectral directional transmittance in frequency and spectral directional transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted &quot;T&quot;ν,Ω and &quot;T&quot;λ,Ω respectively, are defined as
:formula_5
:formula_6
where
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ω,νt is the spectral radiance in frequency &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface;
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ω,νi is the spectral radiance received by that surface;
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ω,λt is the spectral radiance in wavelength &quot;transmitted&quot; by that surface;
*&quot;L&quot;e,Ω,λi is the spectral radiance in wavelength received by that surface.

===Luminous transmittance===

In the field of photometry (optics), the luminous transmittance of a filter is a measure of the amount of luminous flux or intensity transmitted by an optical filter. It is generally defined in terms of a standard illuminant (e.g. Illuminant A, Iluminant C, or Illuminant E). The luminous transmittance with respect to the standard illuminant is defined as:

:formula_7

where:
*formula_8 is the spectral radiant flux or intensity of the standard illuminant (unspecified magnitude).
*formula_9 is the spectral transmittance of the filter
*formula_10 is the luminous efficiency function

The luminous transmittance is independent of the magnitude of the flux or intensity of the standard illuminant used to measure it, and is a dimensionless quantity.

== Internal Transmittance ==

=== Optical Depth ===
By definition, internal transmittance is related to optical depth and to absorbance as
:formula_11
where
*&quot;τ&quot; is the optical depth;
*&quot;A&quot; is the absorbance.

=== Beer–Lambert law ===
The Beer–Lambert law states that, for &quot;N&quot; attenuating species in the material sample,
:formula_12
:formula_13
where
*&quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the attenuation cross section of the attenuating species &quot;i&quot; in the material sample;
*&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number density of the attenuating species &quot;i&quot; in the material sample;
*&quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the molar attenuation coefficient of the attenuating species &quot;i&quot; in the material sample;
*&quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the amount concentration of the attenuating species &quot;i&quot; in the material sample;
*&quot;ℓ&quot; is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
:formula_14
and number density and amount concentration by
:formula_15
where NA is the Avogadro constant.

In case of &quot;uniform&quot; attenuation, these relations become
:formula_16
:formula_17

Cases of &quot;non-uniform&quot; attenuation occur in atmospheric science applications and radiation shielding theory for instance.
