<text>A Lichtenberg figure (German: &quot;Lichtenberg-Figur&quot;), or Lichtenberg dust figure, is a branching electric discharge that sometimes appears on the surface or in the interior of insulating materials. Lichtenberg figures are often associated with the progressive deterioration of high-voltage components and equipment. The study of planar Lichtenberg figures along insulating surfaces and 3D electrical trees within insulating materials often provides engineers with valuable insights for improving the long-term reliability of high-voltage equipment. Lichtenberg figures are now known to occur on or within solids, liquids, and gases during electrical breakdown.

Lichtenberg figures are natural phenomena that exhibit fractal properties.

==History==
Lichtenberg figures are named after the German physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, it was thought that their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric &quot;fluids&quot;.

In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large electrophorus to generate high-voltage static electricity through induction. After discharging a high-voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns by sprinkling various powdered materials onto the surface. By then pressing blank sheets of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern xerography.

This discovery was also the forerunner of the modern day science of plasma physics. Although Lichtenberg only studied two-dimensional (2D) figures, modern high-voltage researchers study 2D and 3D figures (electrical trees) on, and within, insulating materials.

== Formation ==
Two-dimensional (2D) Lichtenberg figures can be produced by placing a sharp-pointed needle perpendicular to the surface of a non-conducting plate, such as of resin, ebonite, or glass. The point is positioned very near or contacting the plate. A source of high voltage such as a Leyden jar (a type of capacitor) or a static electricity generator is applied to the needle, typically through a spark gap. This creates a sudden, small electrical discharge along the surface of the plate. This deposits stranded areas of charge onto the surface of the plate. These electrified areas are then tested by sprinkling a mixture of powdered flowers of sulfur and red lead (Pb3O4 or lead tetroxide) onto the plate.

During handling, powdered sulfur tends to acquire a slight negative charge, while red lead tends to acquire a slight positive charge. The negatively electrified sulfur is attracted to the positively electrified areas of the plate, while the positively electrified red lead is attracted to the negatively electrified areas. 

In addition to the distribution of colors thereby produced, there is also a marked difference in the form of the figure, according to the polarity of the electrical charge that was applied to the plate. If the charge areas were positive, a widely extending patch is seen on the plate, consisting of a dense nucleus from which branches radiate in all directions. Negatively charged areas are considerably smaller and have a sharp circular or fan-like boundary entirely devoid of branches. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz employed Lichtenberg dust figures in his seminal work proving Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic wave theories.
If the plate receives a mixture of positive and negative charges as, for example, from an induction coil, a mixed figure results, consisting of a large red central nucleus, corresponding to the negative charge, surrounded by yellow rays, corresponding to the positive charge. The difference between positive and negative figures seems to depend on the presence of air, for the difference tends to disappear when the experiment is conducted in a vacuum. Peter T. Riess (a 19th-century researcher) theorized that the negative electrification of the plate was caused by the friction of the water vapour, etc., driven along the surface by the explosion that accompanies the disruptive discharge at the point. This electrification would favor the spread of a positive, but hinder that of a negative discharge.

It is now known that electrical charges are transferred to the insulator&#x27;s surface through small spark discharges that occur along the boundary between the gas and insulator surface. Once transferred to the insulator, these excess charges become temporarily stranded. The shapes of the resulting charge distributions reflect the shape of the spark discharges which, in turn, depend on the high voltage polarity and pressure of the gas. Using a higher applied voltage will generate larger-diameter and more branched figures. It is now known that positive Lichtenberg figures have longer, branching structures because long sparks within air can more easily form and propagate from positively charged high-voltage terminals. This property has been used to measure the transient voltage polarity and magnitude of lightning surges on electrical power lines.

Another type of 2D Lichtenberg figure can be created when an insulating surface becomes contaminated with semiconducting material. When a high voltage is applied across the surface, leakage currents may cause localized heating and progressive degradation and charring of the underlying material. Over time, branching, tree-like carbonized patterns are formed upon the surface of the insulator, called electrical trees. This degradation process is called &quot;tracking&quot;. If the conductive paths ultimately bridge the insulating space, the result is catastrophic failure of the insulating material. Some artists purposely apply salt water to the surface of wood or cardboard and then apply a high voltage across the surface to generate complex carbonized 2D Lichtenberg figures on the surface.

=== Fractal similarities ===
The branching, self-similar patterns observed in Lichtenberg figures exhibit fractal properties. Lichtenberg figures often develop during the dielectric breakdown of solids, liquids, and even gases. Their appearance and growth appear to be related to a process called diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA). A useful macroscopic model that combines an electric field with DLA was developed by Niemeyer, Pietronero, and Weismann in 1984, and is known as the dielectric breakdown model (DBM).

Although the electrical breakdown mechanisms of air and PMMA plastic are considerably different, the branching discharges turn out to be related. The branching forms taken by natural lightning also have fractal characteristics.

===Constructal law===
Lichtenberg figures are examples of natural phenomena that exhibit fractal properties. The emergence and evolution of these and the other tree-like structures that abound in nature are summarized by the constructal law. First published by Duke professor Adrian Bejan in 1996, the constructal law is a first principle of physics that summarizes the tendency in nature to generate configurations (patterns, designs) that facilitate the free movement of the imposed currents that flow through it. The constructal law predicts that the tree-like designs described in this article should emerge and evolve to facilitate the movement (point-to-area) of the electrical currents flowing through them.

== Natural occurrences ==

Lichtenberg figures are fern-like patterns that may appear on the skin of lightning strike victims and typically disappear in 24 hours. They are also known as Keraunographic markings.

A lightning strike can also create a large Lichtenberg figure in grass surrounding the point struck. These are sometimes found on golf courses or in grassy meadows. Branching root-shaped &quot;fulgurite&quot; mineral deposits may also be created as sand and soil are fused into glassy tubes by the intense heat of the current.

Electrical treeing often occurs in high-voltage equipment prior to causing complete breakdown. Following these Lichtenberg figures within the insulation during post-accident investigation of an insulation failure can be useful in finding the cause of breakdown. From the direction and shape of the trees and their branches, an experienced high-voltage engineer can see exactly the point where the insulation began to break down, and using that knowledge, possibly find the initial cause as well. Broken-down transformers, high-voltage cables, bushings, and other equipment can usefully be investigated in this manner. The insulation is unrolled (in the case of paper insulation) or sliced in thin slices (in the case of solid insulating materials). The results are then sketched or photographed to create a record of the breakdown process.

== In insulating materials ==
Modern Lichtenberg figures can also be created within solid insulating materials, such as acrylic (polymethyl methacrylate, or PMMA) or glass by injecting them with a beam of high energy electrons from a linear electron beam accelerator (or Linac, a type of particle accelerator). Inside the Linac, electrons are focused and accelerated to form a beam of high-speed particles. Electrons emerging from the accelerator have energies up to 25 MeV and are moving at an appreciable fraction (95 – 99+ percent) of the speed of light (relativistic velocities).
If the electron beam is aimed towards a thick acrylic specimen, the electrons easily penetrate the surface of the acrylic, rapidly decelerating as they collide with molecules inside the plastic, finally coming to rest deep inside the specimen. Since acrylic is an excellent electrical insulator, these electrons become temporarily trapped within the specimen, forming a plane of excess negative charge. Under continued irradiation, the amount of trapped charge builds until the effective voltage inside the specimen reaches millions of volts. Once the electrical stress exceeds the dielectric strength of the plastic, some portions suddenly become conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown.

During breakdown, branching tree or fern-like conductive channels rapidly form and propagate through the plastic, allowing the trapped charge to suddenly rush out in a miniature lightning-like flash and bang. Breakdown of a charged specimen may also be manually triggered by poking the plastic with a pointed conductive object to create a point of excessive voltage stress. During the discharge, the powerful electric sparks leave thousands of branching chains of fractures behind, creating a permanent Lichtenberg figure inside the specimen. Although the internal charge within the specimen is negative, the discharge is initiated from the positively charged exterior surfaces of the specimen, so that the resulting discharge creates a positive Lichtenberg figure. These objects are sometimes called &quot;electron trees&quot;, &quot;beam trees&quot;, or &quot;lightning trees&quot;.

As the electrons rapidly decelerate inside the acrylic, they also generate powerful X-rays. Residual electrons and X-rays darken the acrylic by introducing defects (color centers) in a process called solarization. Solarization initially turns acrylic specimens a lime green color, which then changes to an amber color after the specimen has been discharged. The color usually fades over time, and gentle heating, combined with oxygen, accelerates the fading process.

== On wood ==
Lichtenberg figures can also be produced on wood. The types of wood and grain patterns affect the shape of the Lichtenberg figure produced. By applying a coat of electrolytic solution to the surface of the wood, the resistance of the surface drops considerably. Two electrodes are then placed on the wood and a high voltage is passed across them. Current from the electrodes will cause the surface of the wood to heat up until the electrolyte boils and the wooden surface burns. Because the charred surface of the wood is mildly conductive, the surface of the wood will burn in a pattern outwards from the electrodes. Applying fractal burning to wood can be dangerous; it results in deaths every year from electrocution.

<doc id="476423" wikidata="Q5815" url="?curid=476423" title="Tyumen">
<text>Tyumen ( ; ) is the administrative center and largest city of Tyumen Oblast, Russia. It is situated just east of the Ural Mountains, along the Tura River. Fueled by the Russian oil and gas industry, Tyumen has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, rising to a population of 847,488 at the 2021 Census. Tyumen is among the largest cities of the Ural region and the Ural Federal District. Tyumen is often regarded as the first Siberian city, from the western direction.

Tyumen was the first Russian settlement in Siberia. Founded in 1586 to support Russia&#x27;s eastward expansion, the city has remained one of the most important industrial and economic centers east of the Ural Mountains. Located at the junction of several important trade routes and with easy access to navigable waterways, Tyumen rapidly developed from a small military settlement to a large commercial and industrial city. The central part of Old Tyumen retains many historic buildings from throughout the city&#x27;s history.

Today, Tyumen is an important business center. It is the transport hub and industrial center of Tyumen Oblast – an oil-rich region bordering Kazakhstan – as well as the home of many companies active in Russia&#x27;s oil and gas industry.

==Etymology==
In Turkic and Mongolic languages, &quot;Tümen/Түмэн&quot; (in Siberian Tatar Tömän/Төмән) means a myriad, or ten thousand. Etymologically connected to the Tumen River that delineates sections of the borders between North Korea, Russia, and China.

==History==

The Cossack ataman Yermak Timofeyevich conquered the Tyumen area, originally part of the Siberia Khanate, for the Tsardom of Russia in 1585. The fighting completely destroyed both capitals of the Siberia Khanate, Sibir/Qashliq and Tyumen/Chimgi-Tura (the capital in the 15th century). Sibir was never rebuilt - though it gave its name to all concurrent and future lands in North Asia annexed by Russia - but Tyumen was later re-founded. On July 29, 1586, Tsar Feodor I ordered two regional commanders, Vasily Borisov-Sukin and Ivan Myasnoy, to construct a fortress on the site of the former Siberian Tatar town of Chingi-Tura (&quot;city of Chingis&quot;), also known as &quot;Tyumen&quot;, from the Turkic and Mongol word for &quot;ten thousand&quot; – &quot;tumen&quot;.

Tyumen stood on the &quot;Tyumen Portage&quot;, part of the historical trade-route between Central Asia and the Volga region. Various South Siberian nomads had continuously contested control of the portage in the preceding centuries, and Siberian Tatar and Kalmyk raiders often attacked early Russian settlers. The military situation meant that streltsy and Cossack garrisons stationed in the town predominated in the population of Tyumen until the mid-17th century. As the area became less restive, the town began to take on a less military character.

By the beginning of the 18th century, Tyumen had developed into an important center of trade between Siberia and China to the east and Central Russia to the west. A influx of prisoners-of-war from the Swedish army which surrendered after the Battle of Poltava in 1709 arrived in Tyumen - some of them settled permanently.
Tyumen became an important industrial center, known for leatherworkers, blacksmiths, and other craftsmen. In 1763, 7,000 people were recorded as living in the town.

In the 19th century, the town&#x27;s development continued. In 1836, the first steam boat in Siberia was built in Tyumen. In 1862 a telegraph service reached the town, and in 1864 the first water mains were laid. Further prosperity came to Tyumen after the construction, in 1885, of the Trans-Siberian Railway. For some years, Tyumen served as the Russian Empire&#x27;s easternmost railhead and as the site of transhipment of cargoes between the railway and the cargo boats plying the Tura, Tobol, Irtysh, and Ob Rivers.

By the end of the 19th century, Tyumen&#x27;s population exceeded 30,000, surpassing that of its northern rival Tobolsk, and beginning a process whereby Tyumen gradually eclipsed the former regional capital. The rise of Tyumen culminated on August 14, 1944 when the city finally became the administrative center of the extensive Tyumen Oblast.

Early in the Russian Civil War in 1917, forces loyal to Admiral Alexander Kolchak and his Siberian White Army controlled Tyumen. Soviet insurrectionists took control on January 5, 1918;
the White Army took over on 20 July 1918;
and Red Army troops drove out Kolchak&#x27;s forces on 8 August 1919.

During the 1930s, Tyumen became a major industrial center of the Soviet Union. By the onset of World War II, the city had several well-established industries, including shipbuilding, furniture manufacture, and the manufacture of fur- and leather-goods. World War II saw rapid growth and development in the city. In the winter of 1941, twenty-two major industrial enterprises evacuated to Tyumen from the European part of the Soviet Union. These enterprises went into operation the following spring. Additionally, war-time Tyumen became a &quot;hospital city&quot;, where thousands of wounded soldiers were treated. When it seemed that Moscow might fall to German forces during Operation Barbarossa, in October 1941 Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s body was secretly moved from his mausoleum in Moscow to a hidden tomb in what is now the Tyumen State Agriculture Academy. Between 1941 and 1945, more than 20,000 Tyumen natives fought at the front, and some 6,000 were killed.

Rich oil- and gas-fields were discovered in the Tyumen Oblast in the 1960s. While most of these lay hundreds of kilometers away, near the towns of Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk, Tyumen was the nearest railway junction and so the city became their supply base while the railway was extended northwards. As the result of this economic and population boom, with tens of thousands of skilled workers arriving from across the Soviet Union between 1963 and 1985, the rapid growth of the city also brought a host of problems. Its social infrastructure was limited and the lack of city-planning has resulted in uneven development, with which Tyumen has continued to struggle.

==Geography==
Tyumen is located in Western Siberia, east of Moscow, east of Yekaterinburg, and west of Siberia&#x27;s largest city, Novosibirsk. The city covers an area of . Its primary geographical feature is the Tura River, which crosses the city from northwest to southeast. The river is navigable downstream of the city. The left bank of the Tura is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills. The Tura is a shallow river with extensive marshlands.

The river floods during the snow melting season in the spring. The spring flood usually peaks in the second half of May, when the river becomes 8–10 times wider than during the late-summer low water season. The city is protected from flooding by a dike which can withstand floods up to high. The highest ever flood water level in Tyumen was , recorded in 1979. More recently, in 2007, a water level of 7.76 was recorded. In spring 2005, a flood higher than the critical mark was expected, but did not appear.

=== Cityscape ===

Historically, Tyumen occupied a small area on the high bank of the Tura River around the foundation site of the city. The city consisted of one and two-storey wooden buildings, surrounded by a number of villages. With time, the territory of the city was developed and extended by including the surrounding villages.

When viewed from above, present-day Tyumen appears to be a collection of low-rise towns with occasional clusters of tall buildings. Two areas of the city, Yamskaya Sloboda and Republic Street are noted for their historic character. These areas are dominated by old brick and wooden merchant houses and buildings, with the occasional intrusion of mid-century Soviet low-rise buildings.

Bukharskaya Sloboda is a historic residential area on the low bank of the Tura river. This area is mostly made up of very old one and two-storey wooden buildings. The area is part of the Historical Centre on the city and has a mostly Muslim population. Low bank Dormitories is a cluster of standard 9-storey buildings was built on reclaimed land east of Bukharskaya Sloboda – Zareka and Vatutina.

The area to the east of the historical town centre built between 1948 and 1978 and is mostly 4 and 5-storey buildings. Earlier buildings in this area have individual designs, but the later buildings have a rectangular style. This area contains most of the political and business activities of the town.


The Old Dormitories area features standard five-storey blocks of flats constructed in the 1960s and 1970s at the west and east extremities of the city. However, today this area is actually in the town centre. While there are almost no variety in the area&#x27;s architecture, this area has the most greenery in the city and the best social infrastructure.

The New Dormitories area features clusters of standard tall buildings constructed after 1980 at the south and south-east edges of Tyumen. This area is considered to be the worst place to live in the city. The area is remote, badly planned, and has very poor social infrastructure.

In 2022, the Ministry of Construction published an updated rating of the new urban digitalization index. Tyumen entered the top three cities with a population of 250 thousand to a million people.

==== Architecture ====
Tyumen is not characterized by any particular architectural style. The town was built without planning for decades and because of that its architecture is an eclectic mix of buildings of different styles and eras.

Tyumen&#x27;s nickname is the Capital of Villages because the most of its territory is built up by lumber houses. Many of the wooden buildings located in the historical part of the city are considered culturally valuable.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Tyumen is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Tyumensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Tyumen—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Tyumen is incorporated as Tyumen Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
Tyumen is divided into four administrative okrugs: Kalininsky, Leninsky, Tsentralny, and Vostochny.

==Government==
===City government===
The legislative authority of Tyumen is the City Duma. In addition to legislative activities, the City Duma appoints the Head of the Tyumen City Administration, who is the chief executive officer of the city.

===Oblast government===
Since Tyumen is the administrative center of the oblast, all the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city. They include the elected Legislative Assembly (Duma) of Tyumen Oblast, which also confirms the appointment of the Governor of Tyumen Oblast, who is nominated by the President of Russia.

==Demographics==
Tyumen&#x27;s population grew steadily from the 16th century through the 19th century. However, when the Trans-Siberian Railway arrived at the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s rate of population growth was greatly boosted. Tyumen rapidly became the largest town in the region, with about 30,000 inhabitants by the beginning of the 20th century. Tyumen again experienced rapid population growth with the coming of World War II. The evacuation of workers from factories in central Russia in 1941 more than doubled Tyumen&#x27;s population to 150,000.

In the 1960s, the discovery of the rich oil and gas fields in Western Siberia caused the city&#x27;s population, which had not been forecast to exceed 250,000 inhabitants that decade, to swell to almost half a million. After the growth of the 1960s, a period of population stability lasted until 1988, when economic depression hit the Soviet Union. The city&#x27;s population in 1989 was 476,869, according to the census of that year. However, within five or six years Tyumen was again a major economic center with a rising population. By 2002, Tyumen&#x27;s population had risen to 510,719. Further population growth (mainly due to migration and the incorporation of surrounding settlements) meant that by 2021 Tyumen&#x27;s population increased to 847,488 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
While the population of Tyumen includes people from over a hundred different ethnicities, most belong to one of the following ethnicities:

===Religion===

, there are over ten operational Orthodox temples (both newly built and historical), two mosques (both newly built), one synagogue, and one Roman Catholic church in Tyumen (St. Joseph&#x27;s Church).

====Orthodox Christianity====
While the state religion of the Russian Empire was Orthodoxy, this religion historically prevailed in Tyumen. In 1616, Trinity Monastery was established in Tyumen by Nifont of Kazan. In 1709–1711, this monastery was rebuilt in stone by the order of Filofey Leshchinsky, the first Metropolitan of Siberia. In 1761, the Tyumen Religious School was established. Overall, from 1708 to 1885, twelve stone Orthodox churches of different size, and two monasteries were constructed in Tyumen.

During Soviet times, two of the churches were completely destroyed, but the rest remained. , most of them are accessible and operating. Some operational churches are also under restoration. Tyumen Religious School was reopened in 1997.

====Other religions====
Despite the predominance of Orthodoxy, Catholic churches as well as mosques and synagogues were also built. However, only one Catholic church remains preserved. The Tyumen Mosque was completely destroyed, but its reconstruction on the same site caused controversy. The Tyumen synagogue collapsed in 2000, but was reconstructed on the same site. At the start of the 20th century, there was a strong Old Believers community in Tyumen.

All of the aforementioned religions operate cultural centers in Tyumen. There are also several other religious bodies with a few adherents in Tyumen.

Tyumen Trinity Monastery was built with special permission of Peter the Great. At the time, the construction of stone buildings outside Saint Petersburg was prohibited. The Church of Savior Uncreated was visited by Crown prince Alexandr (later Alexander II) during his Siberian tour.

==Economy==
Tyumen is an important service center for the gas and oil industries in Russia. Due to its advantageous location at the crossing of the motor, rail, water and air ways and its moderate climate Tyumen was an ideal base town for servicing the oil and gas industry of the West Siberia. As a result, today Tyumen is a center of industry, science, culture, education and medicine. Many large oil and gas companies such as Gazprom, LUKoil, Gazpromneft and Shell have their representative offices in Tyumen.

There are numerous factories, engineering companies, oil industry service companies (KCA DEUTAG and Schlumberger), design institutes, shipyard and other oil servicing companies located in Tyumen. 

==Transportation==
=== Railway ===

Tyumen railway station was built in 1885. Currently the station administratively belongs to the Tyumen Division of Sverdlovskaya Rail Road. The station is located in the center of the city. At the regional level, the station services three directions to Yekaterinburg, Omsk, and Tobolsk. The railroad to Yekaterinburg has been electrified since 1980. At the international level, the station services passage to (Trans-Siberian Railway): Poland, Germany, China, Mongolia, and Azerbaijan.

Additional stations within the city territory include: Tyumen North, Tyumen yard, Voynovka yard.

=== Public transportation ===
Public transportation in Tyumen is dominated by both municipal bus services and by numerous private operators (marshrutkas), which account for nearly a third of all transport capacity. The city&#x27;s bus fleet is in process of modernization and expansion, with newly acquired Russian buses replacing the severely aged Soviet models.

Tyumen is a major hub for intercity bus service, centered on the bus terminal, which was constructed in 1972, and greatly expanded between 2006 and 2008.

=== Air transportation ===
Tyumen is served by the international Roschino Airport located west of the city. In addition Plekhanovo Airport is in the area. The Roschino airport has permits to handle the following types of aircraft: Tu-154, Tu-134, An-12, An-24, An-26, Yak-40, Yak-42, IL-18, L-410, B-737, B-767, B-757, IL-86, IL-76, ATR-42, ATR-72, HS-125. The airport also has a permit to handle all types of helicopters. The airstrip is capable of handling large freight aircraft such as the An-22 Antaeus.

The city has a regular service to a large number of Russian towns, including, Moscow (9 flights a day), St. Petersburg, and Samara. There are also weekly or biweekly flights to the following international locations: Baku, Erevan, Khujand, and Tashkent.

=== Roads ===
Tyumen is divided by the Tura River, the Tyumneka River, and the Trans-Siberian Railroad, creating several isolated zones. Ten bridges, one footbridge, seven flyovers, and five foot crossings connect these zones.

In addition, the road network was planned before the fall of the Soviet Union, and in its current state, it can operate normally only in the scheme which includes public transportation only. Compact planning of the city center prevents expansion of main roads; congestion coming from the city periphery moves slower and slower as it approaches the town center. To date, the road network serves about 200% above planned capacity, which leads to numerous traffic jams and high accident rates.

Since 2002, city and regional authorities have undertaken numerous initiatives to improve Tyumen&#x27;s road network, but due to the continued growth of private automobile ownership rates, these efforts have only had short term positive effects. To date, a complex transport infrastructure reconstruction project is being directed by Regional Administration. In January 2015, a paid parking program and prohibition of vehicle access for non-residents began.

<text>Vilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes ( , ; 14 March 1862 – 9 April 1951) was a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist who did much to found the modern practice of weather forecasting. He formulated the primitive equations that are still in use in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling, and he developed the so-called Bergen School of Meteorology, which was successful in advancing weather prediction and meteorology in the early 20th century.

==Life and career==

Born in Christiania (later renamed Oslo), Bjerknes enjoyed an early exposure to fluid dynamics, as assistant to his father, Carl Anton Bjerknes, who had discovered by mathematical analysis the apparent actions at a distance between pulsating and oscillating bodies in a fluid, and their analogy with the electric and magnetic actions at a distance. Apparently no attempt had been made to demonstrate experimentally the theories arrived at by the older professor until Vilhelm Bjerknes, then about 17 or 18 years of age, turned his mathematical knowledge and mechanical abilities to the devising of a series of instruments by which all the well-known phenomena of electricity and magnetism were illustrated and reproduced by spheres and discs and membranes set into rhythmic vibration in a bath containing a viscous fluid such as syrup. These demonstrations formed the most important exhibit in the department of physics at the Exposition Internationale d&#x27;Électricité held in Paris in 1881, and aroused greatest interest in the scientific world.

Vilhelm Bjerknes became assistant to Heinrich Hertz in Bonn 1890–1891 and made substantial contributions to Hertz&#x27; work on electromagnetic resonance. He succeeded in giving the explanation of the phenomenon called &quot;multiple resonance,&quot; discovered by Sarasin and De la Rive. Continuing his experiments at the University of Christiania (1891–1892), he proved experimentally the influence which the conductivity and the magnetic properties of the metallic conductors exert upon the electric oscillations, and measured the depth to which the electric oscillations penetrate in metals of different conductivity and magnetic permeability (the &quot;skin effect&quot;). Finally, in 1895 he furnished a complete theory of the phenomenon of electric resonance, involving a method of utilizing resonance experiments for the determination of the wavelengths, and especially of the damping (the logarithmic decrement) of the oscillations in the transmitter and the receiver of the electric oscillations. These methods contributed much to the development of wireless telegraphy. His papers on electric oscillations were published in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; (1891–1895).

In 1895, he became professor of applied mechanics and mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm where he had been lecturer since 1893. There he elucidated the fundamental interaction between fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. His major contribution was the primitive equations which are used in climate models.
It was this work that inspired both V. Walfrid Ekman and Carl-Gustav Arvid Rossby to apply it to large-scale motions in the oceans and atmosphere and to make modern weather forecasting feasible. Bjerknes himself had foreseen the possible applications as early as 1904. This attack upon the meteorological problems from a hydrodynamical point of view was after 1906 supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., of which he became a research associate. Two introductory volumes, &quot;Statics and Kinematics&quot;, of a greater work, &quot;Dynamic Meteorology and Hydrography&quot;, were published in 1913 under the auspices of the Institution.

In his 1906 work &quot;Fields of force&quot;, Bjerknes was the first to describe and mathematically derive translational forces on bubbles in an acoustic field, now known as Bjerknes forces.

In his &quot;Vorlesungen über Hydrodynamische Fernkräfte nach C. A. Bjerknes Theorie&quot; (1900–1902) he gave the first complete mathematical and experimental exposition of the discoveries of his father, whose age and excessive self-criticism had prevented him from finishing his work himself. In a later book, &quot;Die Kraftfelder&quot; (1909), he stated the same theory in a very much generalized form according to methods of his own.

In 1907, Bjerknes returned to the Royal Frederick University in Oslo before becoming professor of geophysics at the University of Leipzig in 1912. In 1916, he started the publication &quot;Synoptische Darstellung atmosphärischer Zustände über Europa&quot;. In 1917, he founded the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen where he wrote his book &quot;On the Dynamics of the Circular Vortex with Applications to the Atmosphere and to Atmospheric Vortex and Wave Motion&quot; (1921), and laid the foundation for the Bergen School of Meteorology, which was not a literal school but a school of thought on how the practice of weather forecasting and meteorology should be undertaken. He was the originator of an improved and more scientific weather service, afterwards controlled by his son and collaborator, the meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes (1897–1975).

From 1926 to his retirement in 1932, he held a position at the University of Oslo. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1905 and of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1936 and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the 1932 Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society.

He died of heart problems in Oslo. In 1893, Bjerknes had married Honoria Bonnevie, who in earlier years assisted him much in his scientific work. Their son Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes also became a meteorologist.

The craters Bjerknes on the Moon and Bjerknes on Mars are named in his honor.

<text>Sakhir () is a desert area located in the Southern Governorate of Bahrain, near Zallaq. It contains the Al-Sakhir Palace, built in 1870.

Camping in Sakhir during the winter months is a popular activity in the country.

==Notable sites==
In the early 2000s, the area saw many changes such as the creation of the University of Bahrain main campus and Bahrain International Circuit, the home of Formula One&#x27;s Bahrain Grand Prix. During the 2020 Formula One season, the track hosted a second race, the Sakhir Grand Prix, using an alternate track layout.

Sakhir is also the location of the biannual Bahrain International Airshow as well as the Al Areen Wildlife Park, the only nature reserve and zoo located on land in Bahrain.

Bell Sports, an American manufacturer of bicycle and motorsport helmets, has a showroom located near Bahrain International Circuit.

<text>Jason Andrew Dawe (born 4 May 1967) is an English journalist and television presenter. Brought up in Cornwall, Dawe worked at car dealerships and as a motoring industry trainer; he had been a long-time columnist of the motoring section of &quot;The Sunday Times.&quot; He also presented the first series of the rebooted &quot;Top Gear&quot; on BBC Two alongside Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond before being replaced by James May from the next series of the show onwards.

==Journalism==

Dawe is a regular columnist in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; motoring section, where he has written extensively about used cars. Together with Nick Rufford of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; he has also made many video broadcasts of car reviews. He writes for many other motoring magazines and is a regular contributor to radio and TV shows as a motoring expert.

In addition to this, Dawe has also been occasionally known to write in the &quot;Automobile Association&quot; magazine.

==Television career==
Initially, Jeremy Clarkson wanted James May to present the rebooted series of &quot;Top Gear&quot;; however, May was rejected by the BBC, with Dawe agreeing to present the first series alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond. 

When May wished to present the show for the second series due to the increasing popularity of the programme, Clarkson thought about Dawe staying and to have four presenters. However, his co-presenter Richard Hammond was close to being fired by BBC management alongside Dawe. Nevertheless show executive producer Andy Wilman strongly supported Hammond&#x27;s position on the show at the time, stating later in &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine &quot;There was no doubt that Richard would stay”. 

Following his departure from &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Dawe returned to his presenting career in 2005, appearing on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Used Car Roadshow&quot; with Penny Mallory until the programme was cancelled in 2007. From 2009 to 2010, he presented &quot;Classic Gear&quot; alongside Mallory and Alice Crocker, a show about classic cars. Dawe went on to present the 2020 Body Shop Awards, reuniting with Mallory again.

His theoretical innovations included Laban movement analysis (a way of documenting human movement) and Labanotation (a movement notation system), which paved the way for further developments in dance notation and movement analysis. He initiated one of the main approaches to dance therapy. His work on theatrical movement has also been influential. He attempted to apply his ideas to several other fields, including architecture, education, industry, and management.

Following a dress rehearsal of Laban&#x27;s last choral work, Of the Warm Wind and New Joy, which he had prepared for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Joseph Goebbels cancelled the piece after which time Laban fell out of favor with the National Socialist government. He eventually left Germany for England in 1937 after four years of working with the Nazi regime. Between 1945 and 1946, he and his long-term collaborator and former student Lisa Ullmann founded the Laban Art of Movement Guild in London, and the Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, where he worked until his death. The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London has continued this legacy.

==Life and work==
Laban was the son of Rudolf Laban Sr. (1843–1907), a military governor in Pressburg (Pozsony) and (from 1899) field marshal in the Austro-Hungarian Army in the provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Marie (née Bridling; 1858–1926). In 1897, Laban senior was ennobled by the Hungarian monarchy in recognition of his military merit and received the nobiliary predicate &quot;de&quot; to his family name (choosing &quot;Laban de Váralja&quot;; a place name associated with the Laban family), whereupon Laban junior was rightly entitled to use &quot;von&quot; in his family name in the German-speaking world. Laban grew up in the courtly circles of Vienna and Sarajevo.

At a young age, Laban joined a csárdás dance group. At age 15 Laban entered the Theresian Military Academy, but later turned his back on military service. In 1899, Laban moved to Munich and began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts (&quot;Akademie der bildenden Künste&quot;). There Laban met the painter Martha Fricke from Hanover, whom he married on 15 December 1900. They moved to &quot;Arcisstr 44&quot;, where their daughter Azraela was born in 1901.

Parallel to Laban&#x27;s studies at the art academy, he took courses at the newly opened teaching and experimental studio for free and applied art (&quot;Lehr- und Versuchsatelier für Freie und Angewandte Kunst&quot;). There Laban met his future friend Hermann Obrist, who ran the nature studies course. In 1904 Laban decided to leave Munich to visit the most famous art school in Europe, the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris to study architecture.

Laban&#x27;s son, Arpad, was born in Paris in 1905. After three years of a fulfilled bohemian lifestyle with his wife, Martha Fricke died suddenly. Barely two months after the death of Laban&#x27;s wife, his father also died, who had made it possible for Laban to lead an independent life with substantial financial support. From then onwards, Laban&#x27;s two children grew up with their maternal grandparents.

In the years that followed, Laban led an unsteady life between Paris and Vienna, Sanremo and Nice. Financially bankrupt, Laban completed an apprenticeship as an accountant in Nice, from which he also successfully graduated. That was to be Laban&#x27;s only encounter with a regular working life.

Living with his mother in Vienna, Laban made a living as a graphic artist and caricaturist. Laban drew for the magazines &quot;Simplicissimus&quot; and &quot;Jugend&quot; and continued the studies he had begun in Paris on historical dance forms. At a cultural event, Laban met the singer Maja Lederer from Munich and married her on 8 May 1910 in Pressburg. In the same year, they moved to Munich. With his second wife, Laban moved into a dwelling in Schwabing at &quot;Hohenzollernstraße 120&quot;.

In 1911, Laban rented a room in a rear building in Munich&#x27;s &quot;Theresienstraße&quot;, which he set up as a makeshift movement studio. Laban couldn&#x27;t make a living with his school; he had to continue working as a commercial artist and caricaturist. Overworked to the point of exhaustion, Laban collapsed in 1912 and went to the near Dresden for a cure, where patients were cared for according to the life-reform (&quot;Lebensreform&quot;) principles. In this natural healing institution, Laban met and fell in love with Suzanne Perrottet, who was also a patient there. In the years that followed, a largely harmonious triangular relationship developed between Perrottet, Laban and his wife.
Perrottet was to become Laban&#x27;s most important collaborator (along with Mary Wigman and Katja Wulff), lover and mother of his child Allar Perrottet (later André Perrottet von Laban) in Ascona and Zürich. During the First World War, Laban created a school on the natural healing colony Monte Verità in the Swiss canton of Ticino, in the municipality of Ascona, which soon attracted many followers of the new dance art. It was here that Laban conducted his famous summer dance courses from 1913 to 1919. Here the students also strived to live in harmony with nature by growing their own food, vegetarianism, weaving cloth and making their own reform-style clothing, and dancing in the great outdoors nature often nude experimenting with dynamic improvisations. Here Laban experienced his intellectual and artistic breakthrough, celebrating the &quot;&quot;neuen Menschen&quot;, &quot;Fiur-Menschen&quot;, &quot;Anarchos&quot;, and &quot;Orgiastos&quot;&quot; in expressionist dance dramas.

In 1915 Laban, his wife and their two children and Perrottet and son Allar moved to Hombrechtikon near Zürich. There, the extended family lived a self-sufficient lifestyle similar to that on Monte Verità, growing their own food, doing a lot of manual work and sewing their own clothes (e.g. Perrottet developed comfortable clothing for everyday work and dance, which can be attributed to the dress reform movement). At the same time, Laban founded a school for the art of movement (&quot;Schule für Bewegungskunst&quot;) in Zürich. It included interdisciplinary dance art, pantomime, improvisation and experiments with the body, voice, instruments, texts and even drawing. Later Laban only mentioned the terms: form, sound, word.

The conclusion of a large vegetarian and pacifist congress at the end of summer 1917 on Monte Verità in Ascona was the three-part dance drama &quot;&quot; to a text by Otto Borngräber. It began with the setting of the sun, which was followed by the dance of the demons of the night. This part was staged at midnight high in the mountains in front of poet-prophet Gustav Gräser&#x27;s rock grotto. The face masks were created by the Dadaist Marcel Janco. Early in the morning the rising, &quot;victorious&quot; sun was greeted as an expression of the hope of overcoming the war and a utopian higher development of mankind. At these performances worked also Mary Wigman, Sophie Taeuber and Suzanne Perrottet.

===Freemasonry===
Laban had been a member of a Freemason association since 1913, and had founded his own masonic lodge &quot;Johannis lodge of ancient Freemasons of the Scottish-and-Memphis-and-Misraim-Rites in the valley of Zürich&quot; which had six brothers and ten sisters. Whilst on Monte Verità, Laban met the occultist Theodor Reuss, who had been on Monte Verità for some time and had established a local Freemason lodge. On 24 October 1917, Reuss issued a charter to Laban and Hans Rudolf Hilfiker-Dunn (1882–1955) to operate a III° Ordo Templi Orientis Lodge in Zürich called &quot;Libertas et Fraternitas&quot;.

===Weimar Germany===

After the end of World War I, Laban returned to Germany. The Zürich Laban School was taken over and continued by Perrottet. After an interlude in Stuttgart, where Laban worked with the painter Max Ackermann, Laban founded the &quot;Tanzbühne Laban&quot; (Dance Stage Laban) in Hamburg, Weimar Germany in 1922.

The first public performance of a dance poem by Laban took place in Lübeck in the autumn of 1922 in the State Theatre. They called the performance poster by Karl Gatermann the Elder &quot;Der schwingende Tempel&quot; (The Swinging Temple), archived under the number PLK-Laban 29 in the Dance Archive Leipzig. In 1923, the first Laban school was founded, which had its own movement choir. The numerous graduates of the Hamburg School successfully carried Laban&#x27;s method on to various cities in Germany and Europe. In the years that followed, 24 Laban schools were set up across Europe.

In addition, Laban built up a &quot;Choreographic Institute&quot; in Würzburg (1926/27) and Berlin (1928/29). Together with Dussia Bereska, Laban also directed the Chamber Dance Stage (&quot;Kammertanzbühne&quot;) (1925–1927). Bereska from the Laban School in Hamburg features in the popular 1925 German cultural silent film &quot;Wege zu Kraft und Schönheit&quot; (Ways to Strength and Beauty) performing &quot;Die Orchidee&quot; (The Orchid); also featuring in the same film is Mary Wigman and her dance group and the end scene from Laban&#x27;s dance drama &quot;Das lebende Idol&quot; (The living Idol) where Laban himself makes an appearance.

From 1930 to 1934, Laban took over the direction of the ballet of the Berlin State Opera. Laban integrated the ideas of psychologist Carl Jung, and in Laban&#x27;s warm up program the practices of Joseph Pilates, whom according to Pilates, Laban had observed whilst Pilates was working with patients in Hamburg.

===Laban under National Socialism===
Laban directed major festivals of dance under the funding of Joseph Goebbels&#x27; propaganda ministry from 1934 to 1936. Laban even wrote during this time that &quot;we want to dedicate our means of expression and the articulation of our power to the service of the great tasks of our &quot;Volk&quot; (People). With unswerving clarity our &quot;Führer&quot; points the way&quot;. In 1936 Laban become the chairman of the association &quot;German workshops for dance&quot; and received a salary of 1250 ℛℳ per month, but a duodenal ulcer in August of that year bed bound him for two months, eventually leading him to ask to reduce his responsibilities to consultancy. This was accepted and his wage reduced to 500 ℛℳ, Laban&#x27;s employment then ran until March 1937 when his contract ended.

Several allegations of Laban&#x27;s attachment to Nazi ideology have been made, for instance, as early as July 1933 Laban was removing all pupils branded as non-Aryan from the children&#x27;s course he was running as a ballet director. However, some Laban scholars have pointed out that such actions were necessary for survival in Nazi Germany at that time, and that his position was precarious as he was neither a German citizen nor a Nazi party member. In fact, the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933 had an immediate effect on Laban&#x27;s work through the new law passed against racial overcrowding in German schools and universities of 25 April 1933 (&quot;&quot;), Laban was thus bound by this new law of vetting students with the racial characteristic of a &quot;non-Aryan&quot; descent. His work under the Nazi regime culminated in 1936 with Goebbel&#x27;s banning of &quot;Vom Tauwind und der Neuen Freude&quot; (Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy), a choreography intended for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, for not furthering the Nazi agenda.

===England===
In very poor health, Laban managed to travel to Paris in August 1937. Eventually, he was invited to England, where in February 1938 he joined up with two of his former students Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder at the Jooss-Leeder Dance School they had founded at Dartington Hall in Devon (thanks to the philanthropy of Leonard Elmhirst and his wife Dorothy Whitney), where innovative dance was already being taught by other refugees from Nazi Germany.

Laban was greatly assisted in his dance teaching during these years by his close associates and long-term partners Lisa Ullmann and Sylvia Bodmer. Their collaboration led to the founding of the Laban Art of Movement Guild (now known as Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance) in 1945 and The Art of Movement Studio in Manchester in 1946.

In 1947, together with management consultant Fredrick Lawrence, Laban published a book &quot;Effort&quot;, Fordistic study of the time taken to perform tasks in the industrial workplace and the energy used. Laban tried to provide methods intended to help eliminate &quot;shadow movements&quot; (which he believed wasted energy and time) and to focus instead on constructive movements necessary to the job at hand. Laban published &quot;Modern Educational Dance&quot; in 1948 when his ideas on dance for all including children were taught in many British schools. Laban died in England in 1958.

===Notable Laban dance students and associates===
Among Laban&#x27;s students, friends, and associates were Mary Wigman, Suzanne Perrottet, Katja Wulff, Kurt Jooss, Lisa Ullmann, Albrecht Knust, Dussia Bereska, Lilian Harmel, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Hilde Holger, Ana Maletić, Milča Mayerová, Gertrud Kraus, Gisa Geert, Warren Lamb, Elizabeth Sneddon, Dilys Price, Yat Malmgren, Sylvia Bodmer, Betty Meredith-Jones, and Irmgard Bartenieff.

==Legacy==
The Laban Collection in the Laban Archive at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance documents Laban&#x27;s life and work in the 1920s-1950s. The Rudolf Laban Archive at the National Resource Centre for Dance, collected and organised by Lisa Ullmann and Ellinor Hinks, documents his educational work in the UK and contains many of his original drawings. The John Hodgson Collection in the Brotherton Library at Leeds University holds original documents relating to Laban&#x27;s career in Europe in the early twentieth century. Other archives holding material about Laban include the Tanzarchiv Leipzig, Dartington Archive, and the German Dance Archives, Cologne.

Laban&#x27;s students went on to found their own schools of modern dance, influencing their own pupils through the 20th century:

<text>Minusinsk (; ) is a historical town in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. Population: 44,500 (1973).

==History==
&quot;About 330-200 B.C. the iron age triumphed at Minusinsk, producing spiked axes, partly bronze and partly iron, and a group of large collective burial places.&quot; Greco-Roman funerary masks, like those found at Pazyryk, make up the &quot;Minusinsk group: at Trifonova, Bateni, Beya, Kali, Znamenka, etc.&quot; &quot;The Indo-European aristocracy with its Sarmatian connections was succeeded at Minusinsk by the Kirghiz after the third century A.D.&quot;

The Russian settlement of Minyusinskoye () was founded in 1739-1740 at the confluence of the Minusa River with the Yenisei. The Turkic &quot;Min Usa&quot; means &quot;my brook&quot;, or &quot;thousand rivers&quot;. The name transformed to Minusinskoye () in 1810.

By 1822, Minusinsk had emerged as a regional center of farming and transit trade and was granted town status. During the 19th century, it was a node of cultural activities for a very large area. The Martyanov Natural History Museum was opened there in 1877. It is still very active and publishes a quite useful annual report of its scientific findings, meetings, etc.

The town was also a place of political exile. George Kennan wrote in his very influential book &quot;Siberia and the Exile System&quot; (NY 1891) of the town and the museum being an intellectual haven for those tsarist political activists and revolutionaries who had been exiled from European Russia in the 1880s. Vladimir Lenin used to visit Minusinsk on numerous occasions when he was in exile in the nearby village of Shushenskoye between 1897 and 1900. In November 1918, during the Russian Civil War, Minusinsk peasants started a short-lived rebellion against the White Army because of extortion and high taxes. However, poor equipment and supplies led to eventual defeat in the December, and the rebels were subjected to execution, exile, prison or fines.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Minusinsk serves as the administrative center of Minusinsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with the urban-type settlement of Zelyony Bor, incorporated separately as the krai town of Minusinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the krai town of Minusinsk is incorporated as Minusinsk Urban Okrug.

==Geography==
Minusinsk marks the center of the Minusinsk Hollow, one of the most important archaeological areas north of Pazyryk. It is associated with the Afanasevo, Tashtyk, and Tagar cultures—all of them named after settlements in the vicinity of Minusinsk.

===Climate===
Minusinsk has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Dwb&quot;), with very cold winters and warm summers. Precipitation is quite low, but is much higher from June to September than at other times of the year.

== Council of Deputies ==
The seventh convocation of the City Council was elected on the single voting day in 2022 using a mixed majority-proportional system. The composition included 22 deputies - 11 under the majoritarian system, 11 under the proportional system with a barrier of 5%.

The Chairman of the Minusinsk City Council of Deputies since 5 October 2022 is Larisa Ivanovna Chumachenko.

==Culture==

*Minusinsk Drama Theater
Established in 1882 as an amateur theatrical society, the Minusinsk Drama Theater was known as the &quot;Sovtheater&quot; from 1920 to 1930. The theater building was constructed on the initiative of the exiled Kon F.Y. and funded mainly by the fire society. In the beginning, the theater was on the second floor and the fire department took up the first floor. The modern Minusinsk Drama Theater performs in this building until today. 
Milestones in the theater performances were &#x27;Vasilisa Melentyeva&#x27; by Alexander Ostrovsky, &#x27;Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich&#x27; by Alexey Tolstoy, &#x27;Death Squadron&#x27; by A. Korneichuk, &#x27;Destiny&#x27; by Petr Proskurin, &#x27;Is Not Listed&#x27; by Boris Vasiliev. A performance of Alexei Cherkasov&#x27;s drama “Hop” won the Stanislavsky State Prize.
*The Martyanov Natural History Museum (Museum of Local Lore) 
The main attraction of the town is The Martyanov Natural History Museum. Based in 1877, it is one of the oldest in Siberia and first museum in the Yenisei&#x27;s guberniya (province).
*Museum of Decembrists in Minusinsk
*Memorial building of Krzhizhanovsky and Starkov
*Minusink Art Gallery 
*Museum &quot;Automobiles And Motor Vehicles Of The Soviet Union&quot;

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Minusinsk is twinned with:
* Norilsk, Russia

<text>Personal names in German-speaking Europe consist of one or several given names (&quot;Vorname&quot;, plural &quot;Vornamen&quot;) and a surname (&quot;Nachname, Familienname&quot;). The &quot;Vorname&quot; is usually gender-specific. A name is usually cited in the &quot;Western order&quot; of &quot;given name, surname&quot;. The most common exceptions are alphabetized list of surnames, e.g. &quot;Bach, Johann Sebastian&quot;, as well as some official documents and spoken southern German dialects. In most of this, the German conventions parallel the naming conventions in most of Western and Central Europe, including English, Dutch, Italian, and French. There are some vestiges of a patronymic system as they survive in parts of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, but these do not form part of the official name.

Women traditionally adopted their husband&#x27;s name upon marriage and would occasionally retain their maiden name by hyphenation, in a so-called &quot;Doppelname&quot;, e.g. &quot;Else Lasker-Schüler&quot;. Recent legislation motivated by gender equality now allows a married couple to choose the surname they want to use, including an option for men to keep their birthname hyphenated to the common family name in the same way. It is also possible for the spouses to do without a common surname altogether and to keep their birthnames.

The most common given names are either Biblical (&quot;Christian&quot;, derived from names of Biblical characters or saints; &quot;Johann/Hans&quot; &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Georg/Jörg&quot; &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Jakob&quot; &quot;Jacob&quot; and &quot;James&quot;; &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Christina&quot;) or from Germanic names (&quot;Friedrich&quot; &quot;Frederick&quot;, &quot;Ludwig&quot; &quot;Louis&quot;, etc.) Since the 1990s, there has however been a trend of parents picking non-German forms of names, either for originality, or influenced by international celebrities, e.g. &quot;Liam&quot; (Gaelic form of &quot;William&quot;) rather than the German equivalent &quot;Wilhelm&quot; and &quot;Mila&quot;.

Most surnames are derived either from given names (patronym), occupations, or from geographical origin, less often from bodily attributes. They became heritable with the beginning of central demographic records in the early modern period.

==Forenames==

The &quot;Vorname&quot; (in English &quot;forename&quot;) is usually given to a child by the parents shortly after birth. It is common to give a child several &quot;Vornamen&quot; (forenames), one of them intended for everyday use and known as the &quot;Rufname&quot; (&quot;appellation name&quot; or &quot;call name&quot;). 
This &quot;Rufname&quot; is often underlined on official documents, as it is sometimes the second or third name in the sequence of given names on official record, even though it is the given name in daily use from childhood. For example, in the resume submitted by mathematician Emmy Noether to Erlangen University in 1907,

the underlining of &quot;Emmy&quot; communicates that this is the &quot;Rufname&quot;, even though it is the second of two official given names.

In Germany, the chosen name must be approved by the local Standesamt (civil registry office). Although a 1980 law previously stated that the name must indicate the gender of the child, a 2008 court ruling unanimously upheld the right of parents to decide their child&#x27;s name, stating that the only legal limitation is that the name does not negatively affect the well-being of the child.

Among German nobility, a fashion arose in the early modern period to give a large number of forenames, often six or more. This fashion was to some extent copied by the bourgeois class, but subsided again after the end of the 19th century, so that while two or three forenames remain common, a larger number is now rare. The practice persists among German nobility, e.g. Johann Friedrich &quot;Konrad&quot; Carl Eduard Horst Arnold Matthias, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, Duke of Saxony (b. 1952), &quot;Ernst August&quot; Albert Paul Otto Rupprecht Oskar Berthold Friedrich-Ferdinand Christian-Ludwig, Prince of Hanover (b. 1954), &quot;Christian&quot; Heinrich Clemens Paul Frank Peter Welf Wilhelm-Ernst Friedrich Franz Prince of Hanover and Dukelin, Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg (b. 1985).

===Popular given names===
Traditionally, there are dialectal differences between the regions of German-speaking Europe, especially visible in the forms of hypocorisms. These differences are still perceptible in the list of most popular names, even though they are marginalized by super-regional fashionable trends: As of 2012, the top ten given names of Baden-Württemberg (Southern Germany) and of Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany) share the entries &quot;Ben, Paul, Finn, Luca, Max&quot; (male), &quot;Mia, Emma, Lea, Leonie, Anna, Lena, Hanna&quot;, while Schleswig-Holstein retains the traditionally northern (Low German) forms &quot;Lasse&quot; (male) and &quot;Neele&quot; (female) in the top ten.

The following table gives the most popular given names in Germany for every tenth year (since 1890).

==Surnames==

Surnames (&quot;family name&quot;; &quot;Nachname&quot;, &quot;Familienname&quot;) were gradually introduced in German-speaking Europe during the Late Middle Ages. Many of such surnames are derived from nicknames. They are generally classified into four groups by derivation: 
given names, occupational designations, bodily attributes, and toponyms (including references to named buildings). Also, many family names display characteristic features of the dialect of the region they originated in.

* Given names often turned into family names when people were identified by their father&#x27;s name. For example, the first name &quot;Ahrend&quot; developed into the family name &quot;Ahrends&quot; by adding a genitive s-ending, as in &quot;Ahrend&#x27;s son&quot;. Examples: &quot;Ahrends/Ahrens&quot;, &quot;Burkhard&quot;, &quot;Wulff&quot;, &quot;Friedrich&quot;, &quot;Benz&quot;, &quot;Fritz&quot;. With many of the early city records written in Latin, occasionally the Latin genitive singular -i was used such as in &quot;Jakobi&quot; or &quot;Alberti&quot; or (written as -&#x27;y&#x27;) in Mendelssohn Bartholdy.
* Occupational names are the most common form of family names; anybody who had an unusual job would have been bound to be identified by it. Examples: &quot;Gaschler&quot; (glass), &quot;Schmidt&quot; (smith), &quot;Müller&quot; (miller), &quot;Meier&quot; (farm administrator; akin to tenant, steward, sometimes also a bailiff), &quot;Schulze&quot; (constable), &quot;Fischer&quot; (fisherman), &quot;Schneider&quot; (tailor), &quot;Maurer&quot; (mason), &quot;Bauer&quot; (farmer), &quot;Zimmermann&quot; (carpenter), Metzger or Fleischer (butcher), Töpfer, Toepfer (potter) or Klingemann (weapons smith). Also, names referring to nobility such as &quot;Kaiser&quot; (emperor), &quot;König&quot; (king), &quot;Graf&quot; (count) are common, with the name bearers probably only a minor functionary of a monarch.
* Bodily attribute names are family names such as &quot;Krause&quot; (curly), &quot;Schwarzkopf&quot; (black head), &quot;Klein&quot; (small), Groß (big).
* Geographical names (toponyms) are derived from the name of a city or village, or the location of someone&#x27;s home. They often have the &#x27;-er&#x27; postfix that signifies origin (as in English &quot;New Yorker&quot;). Examples: &quot;Kissinger&quot; (from Kissingen), &quot;Schwarzenegger&quot; (from Schwarzenegg or Schwarzeneck), &quot;Bayer&quot; (from Bavaria, German &quot;Bayern&quot;). Böhm indicates that a family originated in Bohemia. A special case of geographical names were those derived from a building or a natural landmark, e.g. a &quot;Busch&quot; (bush) or &quot;Springborn&quot; (spring/well). Before the advent of street names and numbers, even for long times afterwards, many important buildings like inns, mills and farmsteads were given house names or &quot;Hofnamen&quot; &quot;estate names&quot;, e.g. &quot;Rothschild&quot; &quot;red sign/escutcheon&quot;, &quot;Lachs&quot; &quot;(sign of the) salmon&quot;, &quot;Bär&quot; &quot;bear&quot;, &quot;Engels&quot; from &quot;Engel&quot; &quot;angel&quot;, etc. A house or estate name could be combined with a profession, e.g. &quot;Rosenbauer&quot; (rose-farmer, from a farmstead called &#x27;the rose&#x27;); &quot;Kindlmüller&quot; (child&#x27;s miller, from a mill named &#x27;the Christmas child&#x27;, &#x27;the prodigal child&#x27; or &#x27;the king&#x27;s child&#x27;). 
The preposition &quot;von&quot; (&quot;of&quot;) was used to distinguish nobility; for example, if someone was baron of the village of Veltheim, his family name would be &quot;von Veltheim&quot;. In modern times, people who were elevated to nobility often had a &#x27;von&#x27; added to their name. For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe had his name changed to &quot;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&quot;. This practice ended with the abolition of the monarchy in Germany and Austria in 1919. Sometimes &quot;von&quot; is also used in geographical names that are not noble, as in &quot;von Däniken&quot;.

With family names originating locally, many names display particular characteristics of the local dialects, such as the south German, Austrian and Swiss diminutive endings &quot;-l&quot; &quot;-el&quot;, &quot;-erl&quot;, &quot;-le&quot; or &quot;-li&quot; as in &quot;Kleibl&quot;, &quot;Schäuble&quot; or &quot;Nägeli&quot; (from &#x27;Nagel&#x27;, nail). The same is true for regional variants in the naming of professions. While a barrel-maker from Hamburg may have been called &quot;Böttcher&quot;, a Bavarian could easily have been called &quot;Schäffler&quot;.

The surnames of the German Jews are a special case, as they were introduced later, in the late 18th to early 19th century, per &quot;fiat&quot;. The Prussian authorities imposed made-up and sometimes derogatory names. For instance, the name &quot;Waldlieferant&quot; (lit.: forest supplier) was &quot;created&quot; to ridicule a Jewish timber trader. Even way more offensive expressions (&quot;Afterduft&quot;; lit.: anus odour) were in use. This is by no means the rule, though; on the contrary, those surnames most quickly recognized as probably Jewish in origin are distinctly poetical ones, probably as they were made-up choices by the people themselves (e.g. &quot;Rosenzweig&quot;).

Immigration, often sponsored by local authorities, also brought foreign family names into the German-speaking regions. Depending on regional history, geography and economics, many family names have French, Dutch, Italian, Hungarian or Slavic (e.g. Polish) origins. Sometimes they survived in their original form; in other cases, the spelling would be adapted to German (the Slavic ending &quot;ic&quot; becoming the German or or Baltic &quot;-kis&quot; becoming &quot;-ke&quot;). Over time, the spelling often changed to reflect native German pronunciation (&quot;Sloothaak&quot; for the Dutch &quot;Sloothaag&quot;); but some names, such as those of French Huguenots settling in Prussia, retained their spelling but with the pronunciation that would come naturally to a German reading the name: &quot;Marquard&quot;, pronounced in French, ended up being pronounced much like the German &quot;Markwart&quot; from which it was originally derived.

===Marriage===
Traditionally, the wife adopts her husband&#x27;s &quot;Nachname&quot; on marriage and drops her own. However, due to the legal equality of sexes, the opposite is possible as well, though rare.

A few examples of the practice under German law, if &quot;Herr (Mr) Schmidt&quot; and &quot;Frau (Miss) Meyer&quot; marry:

# They can keep their former &quot;Nachnamen&quot;: Herr Schmidt and Frau (Mrs) Meyer. In the 1990s, the law was thus changed. They can later change to variant 2, though the inverse is not possible.
# They can declare one name as a &quot;marriage name&quot; (&quot;Ehename&quot;). In doing so, they can either both adopt the husband&#x27;s name, or both adopt the wife&#x27;s name as an &quot;Ehename&quot;: Herr Meyer and Frau Meyer; Herr Schmidt and Frau Schmidt.
# One partner, but not both, may combine both names by a hyphen. Thus, one of them then bears a double name (&quot;Doppelname&quot;). (Herr Schmidt and Frau Meyer-Schmidt (or Frau Schmidt-Meyer); the children have to be called Schmidt.) Both partners cannot have &quot;Doppelnamen&quot;; thus, there would be no Herr Meyer-Schmidt &quot;and&quot; Frau Meyer-Schmidt.

All children of a family have to receive the same non-hyphenated &quot;Nachname&quot; at birth, which may be either the mother&#x27;s or the father&#x27;s &quot;Nachname&quot; (traditionally it was the father&#x27;s). If the parents adopted an &quot;Ehename&quot; this is the &quot;Nachname&quot; of the child. It is strictly forbidden to give children &quot;Doppelnamen&quot; if it is not the &quot;Ehename&quot;. The latter case can arise with traditional aristocratic &quot;Doppelnamen&quot; (e.g. Faber-Castell).

In Austria (§ 93 ABGB), a couple can choose either of their surnames as married name. In the default case, each partner retains their unmarried name. The partner who is changing surnames has the possibility to use their unmarried name alongside the married name with hyphenation.

In Switzerland (Art. 160 ZGB), the couple can opt to both retain their unmarried name, or the couple can choose to use either surname as their married name. If both retain their name, they need to declare which will be the surname of any future children.

===Nobility===
Titles of former aristocrats (like &quot;Graf&quot; for &quot;Count&quot;) have become parts of the &quot;Nachname&quot; in Germany, giving longer names of several words, usually including the nobiliary particle &quot;von&quot; (meaning &quot;of&quot;) or &quot;zu&quot; (meaning &quot;to&quot;, sometimes &quot;at&quot;), often &quot;von und zu&quot; are also found together (meaning &quot;of and to/at&quot;). The legal rules for these names are the same as those for other &quot;Nachnamen&quot;, which gives rise to a number of cases where people legally bear such names but are not recognized by the associations of formerly noble families in Germany, which continue to apply the old rules of the German Empire in their publications. Most of these cases come about when a woman of noble descent marries a man with no title, and the two adopt the woman&#x27;s name as their common &quot;Nachname&quot;, which was impossible under imperial law.

In Austria, titles of nobility including certain other orders and honours held by Austrian citizens have since 3 April 1919 been abolished, including nobiliary particles such as &quot;von&quot;, the use of such titles by Austrian citizens is an offence punishable with a financial enforcement penalty. For example, Otto von Habsburg, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s last crown prince, was referred to as Otto Habsburg(-Lothringen) in Austria. In Switzerland, where titles of nobility have been rare for several centuries, they can be used in private conversation, but are not officially recognized.

=== Common surnames ===
==== Germany ====

The most common surnames in Germany, counting different spellings together, are roughly:
# 0,87 %: Schmidt, Schmitt, Schmitz, Schmied (&quot;smith, blacksmith&quot;)
# 0,83 %: Müller, Möller (&quot;miller&quot;)
# 0,73 %: Meyer, Meier, Meir, Meyr, Mayer, Maier, Mair, or Mayr (often the senior farmer in a given settlement [running a &quot;full range&quot; farmstead in terms of area, workforce and harvest, compared to various partitions of lesser size], often as the leaseholder of a landlord like an abbey, a worldly ruler, etc.; &quot;tenant, steward, sometimes also a bailiff, but &quot;not&quot; a mayor&quot;)
# 0,43 %: Schulz, Schulze, Schultze, Schulte, Schultheiß, Scholz (&quot;constable&quot;)
# 0,34 %: Schneider (&quot;tailor&quot;)
# 0,30 %: Hoffmann, Hofmann (&quot;steward; tenant/leaseholder; courtier&quot;; with the same meaning, but here not counted, are Hofer, Hoffer, Hoffner, Höfer, Höffer, Höffner, etc)
# 0,28 %: Becker, Beck, Beckmann, Bäcker (&quot;baker&quot;)
# 0,27 %: Fischer (&quot;fisherman&quot;)
# 0,26 %: Weber (&quot;weaver&quot;)
# 0,23 %: Wagner (&quot;carter, cartwright&quot;)
# 0,21 %: Bauer, Baur (&quot;farmer&quot;)
# 0,1925 %: Lange, Lang (&quot;long, tall&quot;)
# 0,1918 %: Wolf, Wolff (&quot;wolf&quot;)

If different spellings are counted separately, the order is different:
# Müller
# Schmidt
# Schneider
# Fischer
# Weber
# Meyer
# Wagner
# Schulz
# Bauer
# Becker

These ten names are all occupational names, designating common occupations around 1600 when surnames became heritable. That&#x27;s why these names arose independently across Germany.

===Gender-specific surname variants===
Traditionally, there was a differentiation of surnames of women from those of their male siblings, which was widespread in Germany until the 18th century. Thus, in old records, especially church registers on rites de passage, such as baptisms, deaths and marriages etc., women may appear bearing regionally typical female surname variants (like, in South Germany: Peter Huber, but Anna Huberin). With the establishment of general official registration of legal names, this practice was abolished in the 18th and the 19th centuries, depending on the legislation of the respective states.

Also, the spelling of given and surnames, varying previously from author to author, or even entry to entry, was then mostly fixed according to the official recorded form. Former noble titles appearing in male and female variants were transformed by the Weimar Constitution, article 109, into parts of the surnames in Germany, but a new tradition of gender-specific variants, for official registration, was established for these surnames. This practice was confirmed in a judgement by the Reichsgericht on 10 March 1926.

Colloquially, surname variants for women continue to appear in some German dialects. In Bavarian dialect surnames of women sometimes are formed by adding the ending &quot;-in&quot;, used in standard High German to indicate noun variants for women or items of grammatical feminine gender, such as Näherin (seamstress), with Näher (seamster) being the male form. Thus a Frau (Mrs.) Gruber may be referred to as &quot;Gruberin&quot;. In West Low German parlance the ending &quot;…sch(e)&quot; is sometimes added to surnames of women, related to the standard High German adjective ending &quot;…isch&quot; (cognitive to English &quot;&quot;), suffixed to nouns or adjectives indicating belonging / pertaining to, being of the kind described by the suffixed word: for example, &quot;de Smidtsche&quot;, is Ms Schmidt (Smith), but literally something like &quot;the Smithian&quot; (the woman pertaining to a man/family named Schmidt).

Another form, indicating a female bearer of a surname, was the addition of a genitive &quot;s&quot; (like the Saxon genitive), the daughter or wife of Mr. Bäcker (literally Baker) would appear as Ms Bäckers (in German without an apostrophe), as being Bäcker&#x27;s daughter or wife.

==Pseudonyms==
Pseudonyms can be used by artists (&quot;Künstlername&quot;, &quot;artist&#x27;s name&quot;) and members of religious orders (&quot;Ordensname&quot;); If a pseudonym is widely known in public it can be added to the passport of that person (under the weaker legal status of &quot;Künstlername&quot;) and be used instead of the original name in most situations. The same field in the passport also serves to show religious names, i.e. the new name somebody takes on when becoming a monk or nun.

==Academic degrees and titles==
The academic degree of &quot;Doktor&quot; (&quot;Dr.&quot;) and the academic title of &quot;Professor&quot; (&quot;Prof.&quot;) are not part of the name in Germany but can be entered into an identity card or passport and are frequently used in documents and addresses.

They are, however, often used in a written address (e.g., Dr. Meier, Prof. Dr. Müller), and will often be used in formal speech or sometimes by lower-ranked persons such as students, though many academics prefer being addressed just like anyone else, i.e. by &quot;Herr&quot; or &quot;Frau&quot; alone (see below).

==Hofname (estate name)==

In rural areas it is common that farmers are known by the traditional name of their &quot;Hof&quot; (farm or estate). Because of the long-standing tradition of impartible inheritance in German-speaking Europe, ownership of a &quot;Hof&quot; had often been tied to direct patrilineal descent over centuries.
Thus, farmers were traditionally known by their &quot;Hofname&quot; even before the development of the &quot;Nachname&quot; in the early modern period, and the two systems came to overlap. Many &quot;Nachnamen&quot; are in fact derived from such &quot;Hofnamen&quot;, but in some instances, the &quot;Hofname&quot; tradition survived alongside the official &quot;Nachname&quot;.

Historically, the &quot;Hofname&quot; was the first type of commoners&#x27; family name to become heritable. This process began still in the Late Middle Ages (14th to 15th century); e.g. Ulrich Zwingli (b. 1484) inherited his father&#x27;s surname, in origin a &quot;Hofname&quot; (from the term &quot;Twing&quot;, denoting a type of walled-in estate) even though he did not inherit his estate.

In cases where &quot;Nachname&quot; and &quot;Hofname&quot; are not identical (usually because there was no male heir at some point in the family history) they are joined in official documents by &quot;genannt&quot; (abbr. &quot;gen.&quot;), e.g. &quot;Amann gen. Behmann&quot;. In Austria the term &quot;vulgo&quot; (abbr. &quot;vlg.&quot;) is used instead of &quot;genannt&quot;. This is called a or vulgo name.
Historically, other forms can be found as well, including Amann &quot;sonst&quot; Behmann &quot;genannt&quot;, Amann &quot;oder&quot; Behmann, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;auf&quot;, &quot;zu&quot;, &quot;alias&quot;, &quot;modo&quot;, &quot;vel&quot;, &quot;dictus&quot;, &quot;dicti&quot;, &quot;vero&quot;, &quot;qui et&quot;, or &quot;de&quot;. In some cases the form &quot;genannt&quot; changed into &quot;von&quot; over time, in other cases it was changed into a hyphenated surname (like Amann-Behmann), but these examples are not the only origins for these latter types of names.

==Name changes==
There are only a few circumstances in which one is allowed to change one&#x27;s name:
# On marriage: the couple can choose the name of either partner, they can both keep their original names, or (provided the original family name of neither partner contains a hyphen), one partner can modify their own name, appending the partner&#x27;s family name to their own, creating a hyphenated name (&quot;Mr. Schmid and Ms. Meier-Schmid&quot; or &quot;Mr. Schmid-Meier and Ms. Meier&quot;).
# Correction of a name: if the state has made an error with the name and this can be proven, the original name can be restored. Example: &quot;Maſs&quot; became &quot;Mahs&quot; and is corrected to &quot;Mass&quot;.
# Gender reassignment, in the case of transsexuals.
# Naturalization of foreigners (per Article 47 of the EGBGB). In this case, the foreigners may choose to adopt German forms of their first and last names, or adopt new first names if their old first names cannot be adapted into German.
# Changing a name that is too complicated (too long or difficult spelling because of origin), too common (like Müller or Schmidt), or causes ridicule (which can be because of the name itself, like &quot;Fick&quot; (&quot;Fuck&quot;, even though of different etymologic origin), or because of association, like &quot;Adolf&quot;).

Though the &quot;Namensänderungsgesetz&quot; (Law concerning the changing of names) allows changing because of any &quot;important reason&quot;, in practice this will very rarely be allowed.

Adding &quot;Doktor&quot; (Ph.D.) in Germany, and adding any academic degree in Austria, into one&#x27;s identity card or passport is not considered a name change.

==Order of names and use of articles==
The &quot;Nachname&quot; is put after the &quot;Vorname&quot;. In the rural use of several regions where heavy dialect is spoken (i.e. Bavaria, Saxony, the Palatinate or the Saarland), the order is reversed, e.g. &quot;der Mühlbach Klaus&quot; instead of &quot;Klaus Mühlbach&quot;. The definite article is always added in this style of naming. Especially in these regions, it is also the usual administrative way, but with a comma; the said person would appear in documents as &quot;Mühlbach, Klaus&quot; or even, with a title or profession &quot;Mühlbach, Klaus, Dr./OLt/Bäcker&quot;.

Except for Southern Germany, usage of the definite article with the name outside of dialect is uncommon, and considered a mistake in Standard German. It is considered familiar language, but not as a mark of rough, rural manners as in French. It is used especially when talking of and/or with children, but also in some other situations. E.g., &quot;Ich bin der Nils&quot; (&#x27;I am the Nils&#x27;).

In Austria, the definite article is always used in informal spoken language, but most of the time not in very formal or written language.

In some dialects (such as those spoken in the Western Palatinate, the Saarland and parts of the Rhineland), the article used with women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; names is not the feminine, but the neuter article. This is because the German word for &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;Mädchen&quot;, is a neuter noun, due to the diminutive suffix &quot;-chen&quot;.

<text>The Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, or Super Tweet, is a light attack aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Cessna.

It was developed during the Vietnam War in response to military interest in new counter-insurgency (COIN) aircraft to replace aging types such as the Douglas A-1 Skyraider. A formal United States Air Force (USAF) evaluation of the T-37 Tweet basic trainer for the COIN mission was conducted in late 1962, after which it was concluded that it could be modified to effectively perform the role. The attack-orientated A-37 was directly derived from the T-37, roughly doubling in both all-up weight and engine thrust to permit considerable quantities of munitions to be carried along with extended flight endurance and additional mission avionics. The prototype YAT-37D performed its maiden flight during October 1964.

While test results were positive, a production contract was not immediately forthcoming until an uptick in combat intensity and aircraft losses became apparent. An initial batch of 25 A-37As was deployed to Vietnam under the &quot;Combat Dragon&quot; evaluation program in August 1967, flying from Bien Hoa Air Base on various missions, including close air support, helicopter escort, FAC, and night interdiction. The type proved itself to be effective in the theater, leading to the USAF issuing a contract to Cessna for an improved Super Tweet, designated the &quot;A-37B&quot;, in early 1967. It was largely operated over South Vietnam, as well as in neighboring Laos and Cambodia, typically flying close air support missions in coordination with US ground forces. The A-37 proved to be relatively low-maintenance, accurate, and suffered relatively few combat losses.

Following the end of the conflict, the USAF&#x27;s A-37Bs were transferred from the Tactical Air Command (TAC) to TAC-gained units in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. The type was assigned to the FAC (Forward Air Control) role and given the designation &quot;OA-37B&quot;. The type were eventually phased out in the 1980s and 1990s, having been replaced in the FAC mission by the more formidable Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in American service. Various international operators, many of which being South American countries, also operated the A-37; it saw active use during the Salvadoran Civil War. Over 200 aircraft were also supplied to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF), and numerous A-37Bs would be captured by North Vietnamese forces near the conflict&#x27;s end.

==Design and development==
During the early 1960s, American military involvement in Vietnam was growing, leading to strong interest from military officials in counter-insurgency (COIN) aircraft. Existing platforms such as the Douglas A-1 Skyraider were less than fully satisfactory, in part because younger pilots, having been trained and used to flying jet aircraft, had difficulties adapting to the A-1&#x27;s increasingly uncommon features for a frontline combat aircraft, such as a radial engine and a &#x27;taildragger&#x27; landing gear arrangement. At the time, the Cessna T-37 Tweet was in widespread use by the military as a basic trainer aircraft. In late 1962, the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) Special Air Warfare Center at Eglin Air Force Base&#x27;s Hurlburt Field in Florida evaluated two T-37Cs for the mission.

The USAF determined the T-37 to be a promising COIN aircraft and expressed its interest in a prospective improved version that would be able to carry a much larger payload along with greater endurance and better short-field performance. These requirements meant the aircraft would have to be considerably heavier and thus necessitate the use of more powerful engines. As to account for the drastic increase in airframe weight along with the need to a significant payload as well, Cessna opted to double the aircraft&#x27;s engine power by replacing its twin Continental J-69 engines with General Electric J85-J2/5 turbojet engines, each capable of generating up to of thrust. During 1963, the USAF awarded a contract to Cessna to produce two prototype aircraft, designated &quot;YAT-37D&quot;; these were essentially heavily modified T-37s.

Specific alterations made for the YAT-37D included the adoption of strengthened wings, the use of larger wingtip fuel tanks of capacity, additional avionics suitable for battlefield communications, navigation, and targeting, toughened landing gear that were suitable for rough-field operation, and the fitting of a General Electric-supplied GAU-2B/A &quot;Minigun&quot; Gatling-style machine gun capable of a rate of fire of 3,000 rounds/minute and 1,500 rounds of ammunition that was installed in the right side of the aircraft&#x27;s nose behind a large access panel along with an accompanying gunsight and gun camera. Perhaps most importantly, three stores pylons were installed on each wing that were compatible with a wide range of munitions.

During October 1964, the first YAT-37D performed its maiden flight, followed one year later by the second prototype. The second prototype was equipped with four stores pylons under each wing as opposed to three, the first prototype was subsequently upgraded to this configuration as well. Test results were good, however, the USAF&#x27;s interest in counter-insurgency (COIN) aircraft had decreased over time. The program went into limbo for a time, with the second prototype &quot;put out to pasture&quot; at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

The conflict in Southeast Asia continued to escalate during the mid 1960s. Losses of Douglas A-1 Skyraider close-support aircraft in USAF, United States Navy, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force service proved to be greater than anticipated, which led to a revival in the USAF&#x27;s interest in COIN aircraft. The YAT-37D seemed like a promising candidate for the role, yet the USAF felt that the only means of being certain was to evaluate the aircraft in real world combat. At the time, this was a relatively unorthodox approach to military aircraft procurement. The USAF issued a contract to Cessna for a pre-production batch of 39 YAT-37Ds, opting for only a few minor changes relative to the prototypes, to be rebuilt from existing T-37Bs. These aircraft were initially designated &quot;AT-37D&quot;, but the designation was quickly changed to &quot;A-37A&quot;. The second prototype YAT-37D was pulled out of the USAF Museum and upgraded to A-37A standards as part of the test program.

The A-37A had a gross takeoff weight of , of which was ordnance. It was a relatively uncomplex aircraft, avoiding any advanced weapon systems or the need for a complex training program to operate. The A-37A retained the dual controls of its T-37B ancestor, allowing it to be used as an operational trainer. In combat &quot;forward air control (FAC)&quot; operations, the second seat was occupied by an observer. Only a single crewman normally flew in the aircraft for close support missions, which permitted a slight increase in ordnance.

==Operational history==

===Vietnam War===
In August 1967, 25 A-37As were deployed to Vietnam under the &quot;Combat Dragon&quot; evaluation program, and flew from Bien Hoa Air Base on USAF &quot;air commando&quot; missions, including close air support, helicopter escort, FAC, and night interdiction. Combat loads included high-explosive bombs, cluster munition dispensers, unguided rocket packs, napalm tanks, and the SUU-11/A Minigun pod. For the majority of missions, the aircraft also carried two additional external fuel tanks on the inner stores pylons.

During this period, the A-37As flew thousands of sorties; none were lost to enemy fire, although two were wrecked in landing accidents. While the aircraft was formally named the &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, many pilots called it the &quot;Super Tweet&quot;. The Combat Dragon program was successful, but unsurprisingly the combat evaluation revealed some of the deficiencies of the A-37A. The most noticeable problem was that the aircraft lacked range and endurance. Other concerns were heavy control response during attack runs (the flight controls were not power-boosted) and the vulnerability of the aircraft&#x27;s non-redundant flight control system. Some pilots also criticised the machine gun as ineffective and negatively impacting the pilot&#x27;s view.
The USAF signed a contract with Cessna in early 1967 for an improved Super Tweet, designated the &quot;A-37B&quot;. The initial order was for 57 aircraft, but this was quickly increased to 127; the unit cost of these aircraft were roughly one quarter of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II all-weather fighter aircraft. The A-37Bs were primarily intended to be supplied to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) as replacements for their A-1 Skyraiders. The A-37B prototype was rolled out in September 1967, with deliveries to the South Vietnamese beginning in 1968.

The A-37Bs were all newly built airframes that were considerably stronger than those of the A-37A, capable of pulling six &quot;g&quot; instead of five, and were built to have a longer fatigue life of 4,000 hours. Field experience would demonstrate that 7,000 hours between overhauls could be tolerated. The A-37B weighed almost twice as much as the T-37C; a remarkable fraction of the loaded weight, , could be external stores. In practice, the A-37B usually operated with at least two and sometimes four underwing fuel tanks to improve combat endurance. The A-37B added a refueling probe to the nose, leading to pipes wrapped around the lower lip of the canopy, for probe-and-drogue aerial refueling. This was an unusual fit for USAF aircraft, which traditionally are configured for boom refueling. Other improvements included updated avionics, a redesigned instrument panel to make the aircraft easier to fly from either seat, an automatic engine inlet de-icing system, and revised landing gear. Like its predecessors, the A-37B was not pressurized.

In order to accommodate the increased weight, the A-37B was powered by General Electric J85-GE-17A engines, providing thrust each. These engines were canted slightly outward and downward to improve single-engine handling. Air commando pilots in Vietnam operating the A-37A had found single-engine cruise an effective means of improving their flight endurance. Modifications were made to control surfaces to improve handling. To improve aircraft and crew survivability, the A-37B was fitted with redundant elevator control runs that were placed as far apart as possible. The ejection seats were armored, the cockpit was lined with nylon flak curtains, and foam-filled self-sealing fuel tanks were installed. To extend endurance, pilots were authorized to fly the A-37 on only one active engine, an uncommon practice outside of emergency situations at that time.

The GPU-2/A and AMD cannon pods were tested with favorable results on the A-37B, but reports indicate that such pods were either seldom or never used in operation.

The A-37 proved to excel at the close air support mission. It was able to engage targets at speeds roughly 100 miles per hour slower than swept-wing fighters and by doing so improve its bombing accuracy; pilots were reportedly able to achieve an average accuracy of . While the aircraft&#x27;s slow speed was feared to make it more vulnerable to hostile ground fire, the A-37&#x27;s relatively small size, atypical speeds, and relatively low altitudes combined to make it somewhat hard to effectively hit with gunfire. The A-37 required a relatively low amount of maintenance compared to contemporary fighters—only two hours of maintenance for each hour of flight time, six times less than that of the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo; a feat was partially due to the convenient placement of multiple access panels at strategic locations.

The A-37 did not typically attract attention from the media, unlike many other USAF combat aircraft used in the theatre; one reason for this was that the type was never flown into North Vietnam, where hostile air defenses were proved to be challenging, claiming to have downed almost 200 F-4s and 300 F-105s by the conflict&#x27;s end. Instead, A-37s operated in the south, as well as in neighboring Laos and Cambodia, where it was typically used to support US ground forces.

A total of 577 A-37Bs were constructed, 254 of which being delivered to the RVNAF. By the war&#x27;s end, the A-37 had flown over 160,000 combat sorties, during which only 22 USAF aircraft were recorded as lost due to combat. The type remained active in the theatre right up until the Fall of Saigon, shortly prior to which efforts were made to retrieve as many as possible before they fell into North Vietnamese hands. As a consequence of the North Vietnamese capture of Da Nang Air Base at the end of March 1975, their forces captured large amounts of stores and equipment, including 33 intact A-37s. On 28 April 1975, several of these captured A-37s were used by the North Vietnamese to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base, still held by the South Vietnamese.

====Post-Vietnam era====
Approximately 187 A-37Bs are believed to have been in RVNAF service by the Fall of Saigon in April 1975. Ninety-two of these were recovered by the US, while the other 95 aircraft would be operated by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force in missions over Cambodia and during the China conflict in 1979. These &quot;renegade&quot; aircraft were phased out of service in the late 1970s or early 1980s, likely due to the lack of spare parts. Some of these captured A-37s were shipped to Vietnam&#x27;s then-Communist allies such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union and East Germany. Others were sold to private foreign owners; six A-37B became the property of American warbird fans while four A-37Bs became privately owned by individuals in Australia and New Zealand.

Following the conflict&#x27;s end, the USAF opted to transfer their A-37Bs from the USAF Tactical Air Command (TAC) to TAC-gained units in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. During the early 1980s, these aircraft were assigned to the FAC (Forward Air Control) role and given the designation &quot;OA-37B&quot;. The OA-37Bs were eventually phased out in the 1980s and 1990s and replaced in the FAC mission by the much more formidable Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in USAF, Air National Guard, and USAF Reserve service.

OA-37s from the 24th Composite Wing&#x27;s (later 24th Wing&#x27;s) &quot;24th Tactical Air Support Squadron&quot; (24 TASS) also saw service during Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989.

===Salvadoran Civil War===

A-37Bs were used extensively by the Salvadoran Air Force during the Salvadoran Civil War, supplied by the United States in 1983 as a replacement for the Salvadoran Air Force&#x27;s Dassault Ouragans, several of which had been destroyed on the ground by the FMLN. A-37Bs were used to bomb rebel bases, columns, towns, provided close air support, and flew interdiction missions. A total of 21 A-37Bs and 9 OA-37Bs were supplied during the war, one of which was lost on November 18, 1989 when fire from a Dragunov sniper rifle killed the co-pilot, causing the pilot to eject, and another that was shot down by an SA-7 missile on November 23, 1990.

Nine A-37s remained in operational condition by the end of the war.

===Other Latin American countries===
The A-37B was also exported to Latin America, mostly during the 1970s. It was well suited to their needs because of its simplicity, low cost, and effectiveness for insurgent warfare. Most of the A-37Bs exported south had the refueling probe shortened to act as a single-point ground refueling probe, or deleted completely.

During the late 1970s, amid rising tensions between Argentina and Chile over conflicting territorial claims, commonly referred to be as the Beagle conflict, the Chilean Air Force retrofitted their T-37s into an armed configuration near identical to that of the A-37. In anticipation of a need for additional combat aircraft, the service subsequently procured A-37s from the United States as well.

The Guatemalan Air Force flew the A-37 in extensive counter-insurgency operations throughout the 1970s-1990s, losing one aircraft in action in 1985. The type has also been widely used for counter-narcotics operations.

During the mid-1970s, 36 A-37Bs were procured for the Peruvian Air Force. On 10 February 1983, a Peruvian A-37 was shot down by an Ecuadorian Air Force IAI Kfir over a border dispute. On 20 April 2001, a Peruvian A-37B shot down a civilian Cessna A185E floatplane with a minigun under surveillance by CIA controllers who advised against engaging. The Peruvian controller had the final authority in this situation, and he believed that the flight was carrying drugs out of the country, and so ordered the A-37 pilot to open fire. As a result a US missionary and her daughter were killed. The Cessna A185E crash landed in a river where locals in their boats helped the passengers.

<doc id="476448" wikidata="Q7851756" url="?curid=476448" title="Tuinal">
<text>Tuinal was the brand name of a discontinued combination drug composed of two barbiturate sodium salts (secobarbital and amobarbital) in equal proportions.

Tuinal was introduced as a sedative-hypnotic (sleeping pill) medication in the late 1940s by Eli Lilly. It was also used in obstetrics for childbirth. It was produced in brightly colored half-reddish orange and half-turquoise blue gelatin capsule form (bullet-shaped Pulvules) for oral administration. Individual capsules contained 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of barbiturate salts. The combination of a short-acting barbiturate, secobarbital, with an intermediate-acting barbiturate, amobarbital, aimed to provide &quot;a rapid yet prolonged hypnotic action&quot;.

Eli Lilly has discontinued the manufacture of Tuinal in the United States due to the diminishing use of barbiturates (largely replaced by the benzodiazepine family of drugs) in outpatient treatment, and its widespread abuse. Currently, Valleant Labs markets secobarbital capsules only. Flynn Pharma of Ireland no longer manufactures Tuinal, Seconal (secobarbital), or Amytal (amobarbital). Amytal has been discontinued, though injectable forms of amobarbital sodium remain. 

The drug was featured in &quot;Psycho Therapy,&quot; a song by the musical band Ramones, who stated &quot;I like takin&#x27; Tuinal/It keeps me edgy and mean/I&#x27;m a teenage schizoid/I&#x27;m a teenage dope fiend.&quot;

==Abuse==

Tuinal saw widespread abuse as a recreational drug from the 1960s through the 1980s. The pill was known colloquially under the street names &quot;tuies&quot;, &quot;tumies&quot;, &quot;double trouble&quot;, &quot;blue tips&quot;, &quot; F-66&#x27;s&quot; (which were the markings on Lilly&#x27;s capsule), &quot;rainbows&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;, &quot;nawls&quot; and &quot;jeebs&quot;. It came in the form of bullet-shaped capsules, half-reddish orange and half-turquoise blue. Like other barbiturate depressants, Tuinal promotes physical and psychological dependency beginning after one week of regular use and carries a high risk of overdose. It was reported in the 1980s as one of the most common ways of self-poisoning. Abuse of this particular drug tapered off after it was discontinued by manufacturers in the late 1990s.

Tuinal is classified as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, meaning it requires a prescription from a licensed practitioner.

<text>The SEAT Ibiza is a supermini car that has been manufactured by Spanish car manufacturer SEAT since 1984. It is SEAT&#x27;s best-selling car. The Ibiza is named after the Spanish island of Ibiza and was the second SEAT model to be named after a Spanish location, after the SEAT Málaga. It was introduced at the 1984 Paris Motor Show as the first car developed by SEAT as an independent company, although it was designed by SEAT in collaboration with well-known firms including Italdesign, Karmann, and Porsche.

From the second-generation version onwards, SEAT formed part of the German automotive industry concern Volkswagen Group. All subsequent Ibiza generations, and the rest of the SEAT model range, incorporated Volkswagen Group platforms, parts, and technologies.

The Ibiza spans five generations, among which it has debuted twice (in its second and in its fourth generations) a new platform of the Volkswagen Group. All of them were the top-selling model in SEAT&#x27;s product line.

The Ibiza is now available only in five-door hatchback variants; between 1993 and 2008, saloon, coupé, and estate versions were sold as the SEAT Córdoba. In 2010, an estate version, called Ibiza ST, was launched.

==First generation (021A; 1984)==


Introduced at the 1984 Paris Motor Show, the SEAT Ibiza Mk1 (codenamed &quot;021A&quot;) entered production on the &#x27;Zona Franca&#x27; assembly lines on 27 April 1984 and proved to be a success for the Spanish manufacturer, as it sold 1,342,001 units prior to the launch of the second-generation Ibiza in 1993. The Ibiza&#x27;s sales success gave the SEAT marque a platform to build on, as it looked to increase sales in following years.

This version, while it established the now classic Ibiza shape, was advertised as having &quot;Italian styling and German engines&quot;: its bodywork was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign, and it was prepared for industrialisation by the German manufacturer Karmann. It was based on the SEAT Ronda, a small family car, which in turn was based on the Fiat Ritmo. The gearbox and powertrain were developed in collaboration with Porsche, thus named under licence &quot;System Porsche&quot;. Despite Porsche&#x27;s direct involvement in the Ibiza&#x27;s engines, it was only after paying a royalty of seven German marks per car sold back to Porsche that SEAT gained the right to put the &#x27;System Porsche&#x27; inscription on the engine blocks.

By the time Giugiaro was assigned to the Ibiza project, his previous proposal for the second generation of the Volkswagen Golf had been rejected by Volkswagen. So when SEAT approached him with the proposal for a spacious supermini-class contender, that particular project was reincarnated as the first generation of the SEAT Ibiza.

Using a compact car as a basis, it was larger than most superminis like the Ford Fiesta and Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova, but smaller than small family cars such as the Ford Escort and Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra. The luggage capacity started from 320 litres, or 1,200 litres after folding rear seats.

It was launched in the United Kingdom market in September 1985, along with the Málaga saloon. It largely competed with budget offerings like the Hyundai Pony, and gave budget buyers a more modern alternative to the outdated offerings from Lada, Škoda, Yugo, and FSO. After a slow start, sales picked up and reached the 10,000-per-year milestone by the end of the decade.

The interior space was good but the styling was fairly unimaginative even though it was known for having a rather quirky interior instrument layout, marked by a lack of control stalks. The indicators were operated by a rocker-switch, and the headlights by a sliding switch. It had three principal trim levels (L, GL, and GLX) with body styles of 3 and 5 doors and several versions including Base, Special, Disco, Chrono, Designer, Fashion, and SXi. As power outputs dropped due to more stringent emissions requirements, a 1.7-litre version of the engine was developed for the Sportline version. For the same reason, a turbocharged version of the 1.5-litre engine was developed for the Swiss market and presented in March 1989.

In the meantime, SEAT had already signed a cooperation agreement with Volkswagen (1982), and in 1986, the German car maker became SEAT&#x27;s major shareholder. The Ibiza Mark 1 received a very light restyling in early 1989 with a moderate exterior face lift, an entirely new, less radical interior, and many mechanical modifications. This is referred to as the second series, although it can be hard to distinguish from the original. Most obvious is the shift from a black plastic grille with seven bars to one with four body-coloured ones, with some models receiving new side moldings. The interior was all new, with new seats and a new steering wheel, while the gearbox was thoroughly redesigned, and the brakes and steering improved. At the time, the Ibiza was being produced at a rate of 1,100 cars per day, and the cumulative production had reached a half million.

A more thorough restyling was launched in 1991 under the name &quot;New style&quot;, although by now an all-new Ibiza was being developed.

The following year, in February 1992, SEAT launched the Ibiza &quot;Serie Olímpica&quot; to celebrate SEAT&#x27;s participation in the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona as a sponsor, and the SEAT Ibiza Mk1 along with the SEAT Toledo Mk1 became the official cars of the Games.

===Engine specifications===
All engines were inline-four-cylinder units, front transverse mounted: The 0.9-litre and 1.2-litre engines had carburetors, as did the 1.5-litre 85 hp engine, while the 1.5-litre 90 hp and 1.7-litre engines, introduced in 1989, used single-point injection systems. The 1.5-litre 100 hp, introduced in 1988, had multi-point fuel injection. The 1.7-litre diesel was an indirect injection unit.

===Motorsport===
The SEAT Ibiza Mk1 took part in several rally events and formed the basis on which the Campeonato SEAT Ibiza de Rallies was organised by the SEAT Sport division in 1985, however its most notable rally version has been the all-wheel-drive Ibiza Bimotor, manufactured in 1986 and equipped with two engines, each delivering power to one axle.

===Rebadges===

In 1997, the Ibiza Mk1 design license was bought by a joint venture between Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile Group and Malaysia&#x27;s Lion Group. In June 1999, it entered production as the Eagle, and was redeveloped and rebadged into the Nanjing Yuejin Soyat in the late 2003. Chinese Ibiza production came to a final end in 2008, after another facelift in 2007.

===Derivatives===
The Spanish company &quot;Emelba&quot; produced two derivatives of the SEAT Ibiza Mk1: a pickup truck version, and the Emelba Siete, a 7-seat MPV derivative.

In addition to the Emelba variants, further Ibiza Mk1 derivative models have been produced from several companies, including the Anibal Raider and Podadera models.

===Concept cars===
SEAT also built a cabriolet version of the SEAT Ibiza Mk1, Ibiza Cabrio, but it did not enter production.
==Second generation (6K; 1993)==
The Ibiza Mk2 (&quot;Typ&quot; 6K) was the first Ibiza generation fully developed and produced under Volkswagen Group ownership. Its platform variant was based on the Volkswagen Polo 6N and Volkswagen Golf Mk3. In the interior, the pre-facelift Ibiza 6K shared its dashboard with many other models from SEAT and Volkswagen, such as the SEAT Córdoba Mk1, the Volkswagen Polo Classic, the SEAT Inca, the Volkswagen Polo Mk3, and others.

This Ibiza was available in three- and five-door models; the saloon/coupé variant was known as the SEAT Córdoba, and the estate was known as the SEAT Córdoba Vario. The Ibiza was regularly the best-selling car in Spain and sold relatively well in the rest of Europe, helping SEAT increase its sales figures significantly from 1993 onwards.

Before the facelift, the trim levels were i, CL, CLX, GLX, Pasion, S, and GTI.

===1996 revision===

The 6K Ibiza had a minor facelift in 1996, which included changing the general aesthetics of the car, by adding smoother bumpers and changing the grille and headlamps and the trim levels offered (Base, E, S, SE, SXE, Sport, GT, GTI, GTI 16V, Cupra, and Sport).

In addition to changes to the appearance of the car, the powertrain and running gear changed with the addition of the 2.0-litre 16v ABF petrol engine.

====Engine specifications====

===1999 facelift===


The 1999 Ibiza Mk2 facelift (&quot;Typ&quot; 6K2, also known as 6K GP01, and sometimes referred to in the UK as the Mk3) was the second Ibiza to be produced under Volkswagen Group management. In addition to a revised front and rear end, new styling cues were added, such as the tailgate-mounted SEAT badge that doubled as a boot release switch when pushed. In the interior, the changes included a newly designed dashboard along with new door panels. The launch of the Cupra models, along with success in rallying, gave it a much stronger, sporty image, which helped align SEAT vis-à-vis the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s recently acquired budget brand Škoda Auto.

The Ibiza&#x27;s 1.05-, 1.4-, 1.6-, and 1.8-litre petrol, and 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) and Suction Diesel Injection (SDI) diesel engines were the same as those used in the Volkswagen Polo. The Ibiza&#x27;s powertrain and running gear were also used in the SEAT Córdoba saloon, estate, and coupé.

Under Volkswagen&#x27;s ownership, SEAT was marketed as a sporty and youthful brand whose cars were sold at competitive prices. The available trim levels were Entry, S, SE, SX, Award, Stella, Signo, Sport (1.8T 20V 156 PS), Cupra, and Cupra R.

SEAT later introduced a more powerful hot hatch, dubbed Cupra, equipped with a turbocharged 1.8-litre engine, followed by the Cupra R, of which only 200 units were produced. The main difference between the two were suspension, Brembo four-opposed piston front disc brake calipers, and a power upgrade from to on the Cupra R model.

By the time production of the second generation Ibiza/Córdoba ceased during 2002, the range had established itself as one of the most popular superminis in Europe of the past decade, having sold 1,522,607 cars from 1993 to 2002.

====Engine specifications====

===Motorsport===
SEAT was not involved in the World Rally Championship after the 1977 season, until 1995, when, after an 18-year gap, they returned with an Ibiza 1.8-litre 16v driven by Erwin Weber in the Rally of Portugal, in the two-wheel-drive category. That same year, Weber won first place in the two-wheel-drive category in the Acropolis Rally, with Antonio Rius in second place. The Copa Ibiza 16V also made its debut that year. The successes of the 1995 season encouraged SEAT to participate the following year in the World Rally Championship in the 2.0-litre engine category, with the SEAT Ibiza Kit Car, a decision which proved to be successful as SEAT won the 1996 FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup title, becoming the first brand to win the world title in its debut year. SEAT Sport in the next two seasons reaffirmed its domination, winning 2.0-litre WRC championship titles in 1997 and 1998, with drivers Harri Rovanperä, Oriol Gómez, Toni Gardemeister, Jörgen Jonasson, and Gwyndaf Evans.

===Safety===
In 2000, the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 was tested for its safety performance under the Euro NCAP assessment scheme and it achieved a 3-star overall rating:


===Rebadges===

The Ibiza was also produced in South Africa, where it was rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo Playa.

===Awards===
* Car of the year 1994, in Spain
* Car of the year award in 1994, in Portugal
==Third generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 6L; 2002)==

The Ibiza Mk3 (&quot;Typ&quot; 6L) was the second Ibiza generation to be fully produced under Volkswagen Group ownership. Built on the same PQ24 platform as the Volkswagen Polo Mk4 (&quot;Typ&quot; 9N), it was styled by the Italian designer Walter de Silva to have a sporty, performance image. The model lineup included two hot hatch variants, the Ibiza FR and Cupra, which compensated for the lack of Polo hot hatch variants (the Polo GTI wasn&#x27;t launched until 2006).

Its production was initially focused in SEAT&#x27;s main plant in Martorell, Spain, however in September 2002 a decision was taken by the Volkswagen Group that a part of the production (up to 50,000 units annually) would be transferred to Volkswagen&#x27;s plant in Bratislava, Slovakia.

Apart from the more aggressive styling, it was larger than the previous two generations, with room for five adults, and a spacious (if rather short) boot. The standard trim level on this model was noticeably higher than previous models. This was regarded by some magazines to be the best supermini, with &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine calling it &quot;Car of the Year&quot; in 2003, and their &quot;Supermini of the Year&quot; for three years in a row.

The SEAT Ibiza Mk3 was also used for several purposes, from police cars to rally cars.

The Ibiza Mk3 pre-facelift model was available with the Award, S, SX, Stylance, Reference, Signo, Stella, Sport, FR, and Cupra R trim levels.

The facelifted third generation Ibiza was made from 2006 to 2008. In 2006, slight cosmetic changes were made to both the interior and exterior, but otherwise the model was very similar to the original Mk3. New trim levels were introduced in 2006 as well: Reference, Stylance, Freerider, Sportrider, Sport, DAB Sport (2006 limited edition), Formula Sport (2007 limited edition), FR, and Cupra, as well as engines with increased power (1.2-litre 12v and 1.4-litre 16v) and a new 1.4-litre TDI diesel version. The FR and Cupra R TDI versions used a 1.9-litre Pumpe-Düse diesel engine with and respectively. The top petrol versions used a 1.8-litre 20v turbo engine with for the FR model and for the Cupra R model. The Ibiza Cupra R TDI and Cupra R 1.8T versions were the top models of the brand, hot hatches designed to compete with rivals in the front-wheel-drive hot hatch segment. There were also two special editions of the Ibiza Cupra R. The first one was called Nürburgring Edition (2006–2007), distinguished by black painted side mirrors and a &quot;Nürburgring&quot; inscription on the door panels. The second was the Last Edition (2008 only) with a new interior logo on the front seats and the gear knob.

===Concept cars===
At the 2006 Geneva Motorshow, SEAT presented the SEAT Ibiza Vaillante concept car, which was based on a three-door SEAT Ibiza Mk3.
== Fourth generation (6J/6P; 2008) ==

The Ibiza Mk4 (&quot;Typ&quot; 6J) was previewed at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show in the form of the Bocanegra concept car. It was styled by the Belgian car designer Luc Donckerwolke with a distinctive &quot;arrow design&quot;, dispensing with the basic Ibiza design language that had been in place since the 1984 original. It was the first among other Volkswagen Group models (Volkswagen Polo Mk5 and Audi A1) to use the latest Volkswagen Group PQ25 platform in the segment of supermini cars,

The model range featured a 5-door hatchback, a 3-door version, and a 5-door estate; the latter was added in Q4 2010.

The new model first went on sale in the middle of 2008, in the 5-door format, followed by a 3-door variant, marketed as the Ibiza SportCoupé or Ibiza SC. An Ibiza Ecomotive model, powered by an , 1.4-litre diesel engine emitting 98 g/km of , was launched in late 2008.

High-performance Ibiza FR, Cupra, and Bocanegra models were launched in June 2009. The Ibiza FR was powered by a 1.4-litre TSI twincharger (turbo and supercharger) engine with a seven-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), while the Ibiza Cupra and Bocanegra have the same powertrain tuned to .

In January 2010, SEAT introduced, for the first time in the Volkswagen Group on the Ibiza&#x27;s specific platform, the 2.0-litre TDI Diesel engine in both a SportCoupe and a five-door Ibiza FR specification. The 2.0 TDI boasts and an average consumption of .

In September 2010, the Ibiza&#x27;s SportCoupe and 5-door variants were extended with the addition of the new 1.2-litre TSI engine.

A special version of the Ibiza Mk4, called &quot;25th anniversary&quot;, was presented at the Barcelona Motor Show in 2009, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Ibiza.

There were many different trim levels for the Ibiza Mk4. From 2009 onwards, the SEAT Ibiza was used exclusively by the UK-based Young Driver Scheme. The Young Driver Scheme uses a mixture of the SportsCoupe and 5-door variants, powered by the 1.2-litre engine.

In July 2010, a revised Ibiza Ecomotive was announced, powered by a 1.2-litre TDI common rail diesel engine with emissions of 89 g/km.

===Facelift===

The facelift model was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, and sales began shortly thereafter. The facelift consisted of a light exterior and interior refresh.

===Ibiza ST===
A 5-door estate car variant, the Ibiza ST, was announced in March 2010, at the Geneva Motor Show. 
The preview of the Ibiza ST was shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show in the form of the IBZ concept car.

The Ibiza ST was long, which increased the boot volume to 430 litres. Two new engine options were introduced with this model, a 105 PS 1.2-litre TSI (petrol) and a 75 PS 1.2-litre TDI diesel.

===Ibiza CONNECT===

The CONNECT model was presented at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show and was equipped with Full Link connectivity technology and the SEAT ConnectApp. This app allowed the user&#x27;s smartphone to be connected to the car&#x27;s infotainment system and to use connectivity features. The SEAT Ibiza CONNECT had a range of exterior body colours that allowed the mirrors and wheels to be customised.

In 2011, the SEAT Ibiza Mk4 was tested for its safety performance under the Euro NCAP assessment scheme and it achieved a 5-star overall rating:

===Second facelift===
The Ibiza received a second, more thorough facelift in 2015. The interior as well as the exterior were changed. According to SEAT, the interior raw materials used were higher in quality, and the overall design was more driver-focused and ergonomic. It was possible to personalise the steering wheel, gear stick, air vents, radio buttons, and door handles with a range of available colours. The centre console was more accessible and there were multiple new technology additions. It was equipped with a multifunctional steering wheel, ambient lighting, and an integrated navigation system along with Full Link technology. The Full Link technology allowed connectivity with the driver&#x27;s mobile phone in a safe and easy way. Mirror Link technology, through the second-generation MIB infotainment system, also replicated the smartphone screen when a compatible device was plugged in. Full Link was also compatible with both Android and Apple smartphones.

The safety features included were: daytime full-LED lights, parking assist with audio warnings, and a rear-view camera which provides live video from the rear of the car to make the driver aware of obstacles when reversing.

Externally, the biggest difference was full LED lights. It was available as a 5-door, sport coupé, and sport tourer, as with the previous Ibiza. A range of Volkswagen Group&#x27;s new 1.0-litre three-cylinder engines (MPI and TSI) were also available with the facelifted Ibiza.

==Fifth generation (6F/KJ1; 2017)==

The fifth-generation SEAT Ibiza 5-door hatchback (&quot;Typ&quot; 6F) was introduced at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. It was based on the MQB A0 platform. It was 2 mm shorter and 87 mm wider than the preceding generation. It was the first vehicle in the VAG group to use the MQB A0 platform, before the VW Polo, Skoda Fabia, and the Audi A1. Engine options included the 1.0-litre MPi, 1.0-litre TSI 3-cylinder petrol, 1.0-litre TSI 3-cylinder CNG, 1.5-litre TSI EVO, and the 1.6-litre TDI four-cylinder diesel.

=== Facelift ===
The facelifted SEAT Ibiza was revealed on April 15, 2021. There were minimal changes made for the exterior styling but the interior received a number of changes such as a larger-sized screen of the touchscreen infotainment system, newly designed steering wheel and the inclusion of soft-touch materials on dashboard.

===Safety===

==== Euro NCAP ====
==== Latin NCAP ====
In 2018, the updated Spanish-built Ibiza in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 5 stars for adult occupants and 5 stars for child occupants from Latin NCAP.

==Motorsport==

The SEAT Ibiza is currently used by German team Münnich Motorsport in the FIA World Rallycross Championship. Debuting at the 2016 World RX of Portugal, the vehicle has had a best result of fifth in the French round of the 2016 season.

==Reliability==
Reliability has been mixed. &quot;Auto Bild&quot; endurance tests from 2011 showed the Ibiza had achieved not only the &quot;best result of any car in the VW Group&quot; but also the &quot;best result for a small car in the history of the AutoBild 100,000 km endurance tests&quot;. Warranty Direct lists the Ibiza name among the UK&#x27;s 100 most reliable cars despite recent generations scoring poorly, with SEAT ranked 26th of 40 manufacturers overall.

==Sales==
Since the first generation of the SEAT Ibiza launched in 1984, more than four million SEAT Ibiza cars had been sold as of 2011.

In the year 2009, the total annual retail sales number of SEAT Ibiza cars was 170,833 vehicles, while the annual production of SEAT Ibiza vehicles made in SEAT&#x27;s Martorell plant was 173,715 units.
The total production per year of SEAT Ibiza cars, manufactured in SEAT and other Volkswagen group&#x27;s plants, is shown in the following table:

<doc id="476451" wikidata="Q3596201" url="?curid=476451" title="Ali Jawdat Al-Ayyubi">
<text>Ali Jawdat Al-Ayyubi (; November 11, 1886 – March 3, 1969) was Prime Minister of Iraq from 1934–1935, 1949–1950, and in the latter half of 1957.

== Early education and careers ==
Ali Jawdat Al-Ayyubi was born in Mosul in 1886 while Iraq was under Ottoman rule. His father served as a police sergeant, and upon retirement owned a grocery store. He was also purportedly a descendant of Saladin. At a young age, Ali was dispatched by his parents from the town of Beaji where they lived, on a ten-day boat trip to Baghdad, where he stayed in the care of an aunt and attended the Rashidiyeh military school. Upon graduation, he went by camel and ship to Istanbul where he attended the Military College with other Iraqis, including Ja&#x27;far al-Askari, Nuri al-Said, Jamil al-Midfai and Yasin al-Hashimi. With these latter, he fought during the First World War throughout the Arab lands for independence from Ottoman rule. Upon establishment in 1921 of the Kingdom of Iraq, with King Faisal I as its ruler, each served in turn in positions of leadership.

== Political career ==
Ali Jawdat served as Military Governor for Aleppo and Homs, during the short-lived tenure of the first Arab Kingdom of Syria, under King Faisal, and thereafter served in turn as Governor of Hillah, Najaf, Karbala, Mosul, Diyala, and Basra and variously as Minister of Finance, Minister of the Interior, Foreign Minister and Iraqi Ambassador to France and Washington, where he established the first Iraqi embassy in the United States. He served three times as Prime Minister (1934, 1949 and 1957), successively under King Faisal I, King Ghazi, and King Faisal II. He was the president of the Chamber of Deputies from March 1935 to August 1935.

The name “Jawdat” was given to him by his teachers and colleagues, and it means “quality” in Arabic. An ardent Arab nationalist, he espoused an inclusionary, non-sectarian vision of Iraq, encompassing its various ethnicities, sects and tribes. He strove to achieve greater autonomy from the influence of the British Empire, as embodied principally in the acquiescent behavior of the Regent, Abd al-Ilah and occasionally of his friend Nuri al-Said, and once resigned as Minister of Finance in Nuri Pasha&#x27;s cabinet in protest at a treaty of cooperation with Great Britain to which Nuri agreed.

The Iraqi monarchy, represented by King Faisal II, was toppled in the 14 July Revolution led by Abd al-Karim Qasim, driven by months of intensive radio propaganda by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Voice of the Arabs. Ali Jawdat survived the coup, but Nuri al-Said and other leaders did not.

== Personal life ==
While Military Governor of Aleppo and Homs in 1919, he met and married Nazik Tahseen, and they had three children, Nizar, Selwa and Nameer. Ali Jawdat lived simply and modestly, and was recognized for his integrity, courage and dedication to Arab nationalism.

== Death ==
He died in Beirut on March 3, 1969, shortly after completing his memoire.

<text>Pskov Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located in the west of the country. Its administrative center is the city of Pskov. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 599,084.

==Geography==
Pskov Oblast is the westernmost federal subject of contiguous Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast, while located further to the west, is an exclave). It borders with Leningrad Oblast in the north, Novgorod Oblast in the east, Tver and Smolensk Oblasts in the southeast, Vitebsk Oblast of Belarus in the south, and with the counties of Latvia (Alūksne Municipality, Balvi Municipality, and Ludza Municipality) and Estonia (Võru County) in the west. In the northwest, Pskov Oblast is limited by Lake Peipus, which makes up most of the state border with Estonia.

The oblast is located in the Baltic Sea drainage basin, mostly in the basin of the Narva River. The biggest river of this basin is the Velikaya, which flows across the whole oblast from south to north and drains into Lake Peipus. The drainage basin of the Velikaya covers the whole territory of the oblast, with the exception of relatively minor areas in its southern, eastern, and northeastern parts. The rivers in the southeast drain into the Lovat, which has its source in Belarus and crosses Pskov Oblast from south to north, continuing to Novgorod Oblast. 

The Lovat is a major tributary of Lake Ilmen and is itself in the Neva River&#x27;s basin. Another tributary of Lake Ilmen is the Shelon River, which flows in the eastern part of the oblast. Finally, minor areas in the south lie in the basin of the Western Dvina. A short stretch of the Western Dvina makes up the border between Pskov and Tver Oblasts.

The north of the oblast is flat and swampy, whereas the central and the southern parts are formed by glacial landscapes. There are many lakes, especially in the south. The biggest one, after Lake Peipus, is Lake Zhizhitskoye, with an area of . It is located in the southeast of the oblast, in the basin of the Western Dvina.

Wood is one of the most important natural resources in the oblast, with forests taking up to one-third of the territory. Total wood reserves as of January 1, 2005 were estimated to be at .

==History==
Pskov was first mentioned in chronicles under the year 903, and several versions of the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks ran through its current territory, along the Velikaya and the Lovat rivers. Until the 1230s, Pskov was a principality; subsequently it was subordinated to Novgorod and became a republic, one of the two republics in Rus. In the Pskov Republic, the highest authority was the assembly of citizens. In 1348, the Treaty of Bolotovo was concluded, recognizing the independence of Pskov. Over time Pskov became dependent on the Grand Duchy of Moscow and after 1399 Moscow appointed viceroys to Pskov. Formal independence ended in 1510, when Pskov was occupied by the troops of Vasili III of Russia, the Grand Prince of Moscow. Throughout history, Pskov lands were always situated in the west of Russian Lands, and its rulers were almost constantly at war. In 1242 the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus stopped the expansion of the Teutonic Knights to the east. During the Livonian War, in 1581, the Polish troops laid siege to Pskov. The areas which now constitute the southern part of the oblast changed hands many times, but after the Livonian War, they were made part of Poland and remained as such until the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The southeastern part of the oblast then became part of the Principality of Toropets before it was attached to Moscow in the 15th century.

, 1708 Tsar Peter the Great issued an edict which established seven governorates. The north of the present area of Pskov Oblast, which at the time belonged to Russia, was a part of Ingermanland Governorate, which was renamed Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710. In 1727, a separate Novgorod Governorate was established, and the area was transferred there. It was subdivided into five provinces, and the current area of Pskov Oblast was split between two of them - Pskov and Velikiye Luki Provinces. In 1772, in order to accommodate areas acquired by Russia as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Pskov Governorate with the seat in Opochka was created. It quickly proved to be unmanageable and was split in 1776 into Pskov and Polotsk Governorates. Pskov was made the administrative center of Pskov Governorate. In 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed into Pskov Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished, and the emperor Paul I issued a decree restoring Pskov Governorate. The southern part of Pskov Oblast wento through a number of administrative reforms, before ending up in Vitebsk Governorate. After 1919, Vitebsk Governorate was a part of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished, and its northeastern part was transferred to Pskov Governorate. Besides, in 1920 the westernmost areas of the Pskov Governorate including Pechory, Izborsk, Vyshgorodok and Pytalovo that since 1918 were occupied by the North-Western Army, Latvian and Estonian republican units, were ceded from Russian SFR to Latvia and Estonia respectively under the Tartu Peace Treaty and Riga Peace Treaty.

On August 1, 1927 the governorates were abolished, and the area became a part of newly established Leningrad Oblast. The southern part was soon split off and went through a number of administrative reforms, being at different times located in Western Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, and Kalinin Oblast. Between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944, during World War II, the current area of Pskov Oblast was occupied by German troops. In particular, the partisan movement was pretty active in the area. After the liberation, on August 22, 1944, Velikiye Luki Oblast was established, with the center in Velikiye Luki, and on the following day, August 23, 1944, Pskov Oblast was established. In 1945 areas ceded by Russian SFR to Latvia and Estonia in 1920 were transferred back from Estonian and Latvian Soviet Socialist Republics to Pskov Oblast, including the town of Pechory. Together, Pskov and Velikiye Luki Oblasts now contained all the areas which currently constitute Pskov Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished and split between Pskov and Kalinin Oblasts. After Kholmsky and Ploskoshsky Districts were transferred to Novgorod and Kalinin Oblasts, respectively, in July 1958, the borders of Pskov Oblast did not change.

In the course of 20th century the population of the Pskov oblast declined significantly and its composition changed. In 1926 almost 1.7 million people lived within the modern borders of the oblast, 92% in rural localities. By 1950 the population dropped to little more than one million due to the forced collectivisation in the 1930s, losses during the Second World War and internal migration to other areas of the Soviet Union. Further population movements and the general Russian demographic crisis of the 1990s brought the population down to less than 700 thousand. The industrialisation led to the increase of the urban population which reached 50% in 1976.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Pskov CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside the elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Pskov Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

Liya Milushkina, supporter of Alexey Navalny and former head of the regional Open Russia organisation, and her husband Artyom were convicted for sale of illegal drugs and sentenced to 10.5 and 11 years in prison respectively. They said that the drugs had been planted and the conviction was politically motivated.

===Restricted access===
The areas close to Estonian-Russian and Latvian-Russian border are included into the border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russian Federation from unwanted activity. None of towns or urban-type settlements is currently included in the border security zone. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local FSB department is required.

===Authorities===
According to the Charter of the Pskov Oblast, state power in the region is exercised based on the separation of powers into legislative and executive branches. The state authorities of the Pskov Oblast are located in Pskov.

====Legislature====
The Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies exercises legislative power. The first convocation began work on 8 April 1994. Since 2002, it has been elected by the inhabitants of the Oblast according to a mixed system - the region was one of the first to apply such a model. Since 2007, it has consisted of 44 deputies (22 + 22): one half is elected on party lists (proportional system), the second - in single-member districts (majority system). To obtain the right to participate in the distribution of mandates to the Assembly under the proportional system, parties must overcome the 5% threshold.

The current 6th convocation was elected on 18 September 2016. The seats in the Assembly were distributed as follows: United Russia received 33 seats (in all 22 single-mandate districts and 11 on party lists), the Communist Party of the Russian Federation - 5 seats (all on party lists), the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia - 3 seats (all on party lists), A Just Russia - 2 places (all on party lists) and Yabloko - one place (on party lists). Alexander Kotov, who headed the Assembly of the fifth convocation, was again elected Chairman.

The powers of the convocation will last five years - until September 2021.

As of 1 August 2020, the seats in the Assembly are distributed as follows: 31 seats - United Russia (in 20 single-mandate constituencies and 11 on party lists), the Communist Party of the Russian Federation - 5 seats (all 5 on party lists), the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia - 3 seats (all 3 on party lists), A Just Russia - 2 seats (all 2 on party lists), and Yabloko - 2 seats (1 single-member district and 1 on party lists), one deputy - outside the faction (single-member district). The chairman of the regional Assembly of Deputies is Alexander Kotov, who headed the Assembly of the fifth convocation.

====Executive====
Executive power is exercised by the governor of the Pskov Oblast, who heads the administration of the Pskov Oblast and other executive authorities. The governor is the highest official in the region, elected by the region&#x27;s residents for five years. The same person cannot be governor for more than two terms in a row.

Andrey Turchak was the governor from 2009 to 2017.

On 12 October 2017, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Vedernikov, who previously held the position of Deputy Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Northwestern Federal Okrug, was appointed acting Governor of the Pskov Oblast.

On 9 September 2018, Mikhail Vedernikov was elected governor of the Pskov Oblast (he was nominated for election by the Pskov Oblast branch of the United Russia party based on the results of a preliminary intra-party vote), won the first round, gaining 70.68% of the vote, and took office on 17 September 2018.

== Transportation ==
The railway connecting Bologoye and Pskov via Dno and Porkhov crosses the district from east to west. It continues to Pechory and across the border to Tartu, though there is no railway passenger connections between Pskov and Estonia. In Pskov, it crosses another railroad connecting Saint Petersburg with Riga via Plyussa, Ostrov, and Pytalovo. Gdov is connected by railroad with Veymarn via Slantsy. This is a part of the railway which continued south to Pskov, however, the stretch between Gdov and Pskov was destroyed during World War II and never rebuilt. In the south, the railway connecting Moscow with Riga crosses the oblast from east to west, passing through Velikiye Luki, Novosokolniki, and Sebezh. Another railway, running in the east of the oblast in the north–south direction, connects Saint Petersburg via Dno and Novosokolniki with Nevel. In Nevel it splits into two railway lines, both running southeast into Belarus: One line to Vitebsk, and another one to Grodno via Polotsk and Molodechno. Finally, Velikiye Luki is a terminus of the railway line running northeast to Bologoye.

The road network in the oblast is relatively dense, excluding depopulated swampy areas in the east of the oblast. The two most significant highways are the M9 highway which connects Moscow and Riga and runs in the east–west direction, and the M20 highway which connects Saint Petersburg and Kiev, running from north to south. The two highways cross near Pustoshka. A number of road stretches are toll roads. Ostrov is the northern terminus of the European route E262, which proceeds to Kaunas via Rēzekne and Daugavpils.

The oblast is served by airports in Pskov and Velikiye Luki. Pskov Airport (Kresty) serves regular flights to Moscow Domodedovo and Saint Petersburg Pulkovo. These flights are operated by Pskovavia, a local airline.

The very lowest part of the Velikaya is navigable.

==Culture and recreation==
Pskov, similarly to Novgorod, avoided the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, and therefore it conserved the best examples of Old Russian architecture. The Christ&#x27;s Transfiguration Cathedral of Mirozhsky Monastery in Pskov, built in the 12th century, contains the 12th-century frescoes, which are extremely rare in Russia. The only other pre-Mongol building in Pskov Oblast is the katholikon of the Ivanovsky Monastery in Pskov, which was constructed in the 1140s and is allegedly the oldest surviving building in the oblast. In Pskov and its immediate surroundings there are several dozens churches built between the end of the 14th and the 17th century. They all have a very simple architecture, painted white from the outside, and most of them have a belfry constructed just on the main church building. Another architecture feature of Pskov is a presence of a large number of the 17th century living houses (&quot;palatas&quot;). Pre-18th century civil architecture is extremely rare in Russia, only a handful of building survived, and Pskov contains several dozens of the best samples of this genre.
Pskov for a considerable part of its history was located at the west border of Russia, and therefore the fortification architecture was particularly useful in the area. The best surviving examples are the Pskov Kremlin, the walls and the towers surrounding the historic center of Pskov, the fortress in Izborsk, the Pskov-Caves Monastery in the town of Pechory, and the fortress in Porkhov.

Pskov Governorate happened to be the location of the family estate of Alexander Pushkin, a Russian poet credited with the creation of contemporary Russian language. He spent considerable time at the estate, and once was banished there for two years. In Soviet times, the estate and surrounding areas were transformed into the Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve and became a primary tourist attraction. The estate which belonged to the family of the composer Modest Mussorgsky in Kunyinsky District is also preserved as a museum.

<text>Christophorus Henricus Diedericus Buys Ballot (; October 10, 1817February 3, 1890) was a Dutch chemist and meteorologist after whom Buys Ballot&#x27;s law and the Buys Ballot table are named. He was first chairman of the International Meteorological Organization, the organization that would become the World Meteorological Organization.

==Biography==

Buys Ballot was the son of a Dutch Reformed minister, born in Kloetinge, Netherlands. He attended the Gymnasium at Zaltbommel and the University of Utrecht. After receiving his doctorate in 1844, he became lecturer in mineralogy and geology at Utrecht; he added theoretical chemistry in 1846. In 1847 he was appointed professor of mathematics and from 1867 until his retirement he was professor of physics.

Buys Ballot tested the Doppler effect for sound waves in 1845 by using a group of musicians playing a calibrated note on a train in the Utrecht-Amsterdam line.

He died in the Dutch city of Utrecht.

==Accomplishments==

Buys Ballot is best known for his accomplishments in the field of meteorology, specifically the explanation of the direction of air flow in large weather systems. Furthermore, he founded the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute in 1854 and he remained its chief director until his death. He was one of the first to see the need for international cooperation, and in 1873 he organized and became the first chairman of the International Meteorological Organization, a precursor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Buys Ballot&#x27;s law states that if a person in the Northern Hemisphere stands with his back to the wind, the atmospheric pressure is low to the left, high to the right. His main research effort in meteorology went into examining long-time series for regularities; he was more concerned with establishing the regularities than in explaining them. He made no contributions to the theory of meteorology which is perhaps surprising given his training in physics. The contrast with his American contemporary, William Ferrel, who discovered Buys-Ballot&#x27;s law slightly earlier, is striking.

Buys Ballot devised a tabular method for investigating periodicity in time series. In 1847 he used the table now named after him to determine the period of the sun&#x27;s rotation from daily observations of temperature in the Netherlands from 1729 to 1846.

Buys Ballot became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855 and an honorary member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters in 1887.

Among his students was the prominent Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn.

==Eponym==
In 1970 the lunar crater Buys-Ballot, on the far side of the Moon, was named in his honour.

<text>Nehemiah Grew (26 September 164125 March 1712) was an English plant anatomist and physiologist, known as the &quot;Father of Plant Anatomy&quot;.

== Biography ==
Grew was the only son of Obadiah Grew (1607–1688), Nonconformist divine and vicar of St Michaels, Coventry, and was born in Warwickshire. He graduated at Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1661, and ten years later took the degree of MD at Leiden University, his thesis being &quot;Disputatio medico-physica de liquore nervoso&quot;. He began observations on the anatomy of plants in 1664, and in 1670 his essay, &quot;The Anatomy of Vegetables begun&quot;, was communicated to the Royal Society by Bishop Wilkins, on whose recommendation he was in the following year elected a fellow. In 1672, when the essay was published, he settled in London, and soon acquired an extensive practice as a physician. In 1673 he published his &quot;Idea of a Phytological History&quot;, which consisted of papers he had communicated to the Royal Society in the preceding year, and in 1677 he succeeded Henry Oldenburg as secretary of the society. He edited the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; in 1678–1679, and in 1681 he published by request a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved at Gresham College, with which were printed some papers he had read to the Royal Society on the &quot;Comparative Anatomy of Stomachs and Guts&quot;.

In 1682 appeared his great work on the &quot;Anatomy of Plants&quot;, which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was divided into four books, &quot;Anatomy of Vegetables begun&quot;, &quot;Anatomy of Roots&quot;, &quot;Anatomy of Trunks&quot; and &quot;Anatomy of Leaves, Flowers, Fruits and Seeds&quot;, and was illustrated with eighty-two plates, while appended to it were seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly hypothesized that stamens are male organs. &quot;Anatomy of Plants&quot; also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.

Much of Grew&#x27;s pioneering work with the microscope was contemporary with that of Marcello Malpighi (b.1628-d.1694), and the two reportedly borrowed freely from one another. Grew&#x27;s work on pollen was more extensive than that of Malpighi, leading to the discovery that although all pollen is roughly globular, size and shape is different between species; however, pollen grains within a species are all alike. This discovery is central to the field of palynology.

Among his other publications were &quot;Seawater made Fresh&quot; (1684), the &quot;Nature and Use of the Salt contained in Epsom and such other Waters&quot; (1697), which was a rendering of his &quot;Tractatus de salis&quot; (1693), and &quot;Cosmologia Sacra&quot; (1701).

Linnaeus named a genus of trees &quot;Grewia&quot; in his honour.

At Pembroke there is a stained-glass representation of a page of his work in the college&#x27;s Library.

Grew is also considered to be one of the pioneers of dactyloscopy. He was the first person to study and describe ridges, furrows, and pores on hand and foot surfaces. In 1684, he published accurate drawings of finger ridge patterns.

<text>Nottingham Trent University (NTU) is a public research university located in Nottingham, England. Its origins date back to 1843 with the establishment of the Nottingham Government School of Design, which still operates within the university. 

Nottingham Trent University is the sixth largest university in the UK (out of ) with over 40,000 students across six different campuses mainly concentrated in Nottingham (including the city centre, Southwell, and Clifton). The university recently opened a new campus in London. 

The university is composed of nine academic schools: School of Animal, Rural &amp; Environmental Sciences, School of Architecture, Design &amp; the Built Environment, School of Art &amp; Design, School of Arts &amp; Humanities, Nottingham Business School, Nottingham Law School, School of Science &amp; Technology, School of Social Sciences, and Confetti. 

In recent years, the university has received various awards, including the Times Higher Education University of the Year award in 2017. The university is a member of the European University Association, Association of Commonwealth Universities, Universities UK, Association of MBAs, and Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. 

==History==

Nottingham Trent University was formed by the amalgamation of several institutions of higher education in Nottingham. It originated from the Nottingham Government School of Design founded in 1843.

In 1945, the Nottingham and District Technical College was established. In 1958, Nottingham Regional College of Technology opened and in 1959, the Nottingham College of Education began at Clifton. In 1964, Nottingham Regional College was opened and in 1966, the original Nottingham College of Design was linked with the Regional College. Together they merged and the institution was upgraded to Polytechnic status in 1970 to become &#x27;Trent Polytechnic&#x27;. In 1975 it amalgamated with Nottingham College of Education, and in 1988 the official name changed to &#x27;Nottingham Polytechnic&#x27;.

Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, all polytechnics and some higher education colleges became eligible for full university status; at this point, the institution officially became &#x27;Nottingham Trent University&#x27;.

==Campuses==
The university has six campuses: City, Clifton, Creative Quarter, Brackenhurst, Confetti London, and NTU in Mansfield.

===City campus===

Located just north of Nottingham City Centre, the City site is home to over 17,000 students from Nottingham Business School, Nottingham Law School, School of Architecture, Design and the Built Environment, School of Art &amp; Design, School of Social Sciences, and the Centre for Broadcasting &amp; Journalism. The university&#x27;s flagship buildings are the regenerated Newton and Arkwright, which are both Grade II listed buildings. On 18 May 2011, the two buildings were officially opened by Sir David Attenborough.

==Environmental profile==

===Sustainability===
The university was named &quot;the most environmentally friendly university in the country&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and in 2009 it was awarded the title of &quot;the most environmentally friendly university in the UK&quot;, by The People &amp; Planet Green League (the only independent ranking of British universities&#x27; environmental and ethical performance – published by the Times Higher Education); with 100% of the university&#x27;s electricity generated by renewable sources since 2009.

Between 2009 and 2012, NTU received four First Class Awards from Green League, reflecting its commitment to carbon reduction and its efforts to become an environmentally aware higher education institution.

Aside from organising various &#x27;green&#x27; activity clusters (e.g., The Carbon Elephant, The Wind Turbines Project, The UCycle Scheme), the university has also been formally awarded Fairtrade status. Fairtrade products are therefore available in all campus shops, catering outlets and the Students&#x27; Union. Also, Nottingham Trent University branded T-shirts and hoodies sold in the Student Union shops are made from Fairtrade cotton. Additionally, the university holds a yearly Fairtrade Fortnight Celebration, featuring a range of events and activities to raise awareness of the work of the Fairtrade Foundation and NTU&#x27;s commitment to ensuring that farmers in some of the poorest areas of the world receive a fair price for their produce.

The university published a Sustainable Purchasing Policy in 2007, which was said to outline specific aims meant to embed sustainability into the institution&#x27;s purchasing activities. NTU also acknowledged its responsibility to operate in an ethical manner and claims to take into account social, environmental and ethical considerations in all of its activities, including financial investment. The university&#x27;s Treasury Management Policy included a separate section on Ethical Investment, which states that &quot;investments shall only be made with institutions with a clear and transparent Ethical Investment Policy which reflect the university&#x27;s ethical values&quot;.

===Campus biodiversity===

The university&#x27;s conglomerated estate includes approximately 250 hectares of land, spread across its three campuses. These different land types, ranging from urban centres to farmland, are considered valuable ecological assets by the university, which is dedicated to conserving the biodiversity found on and around its grounds.

*City Campus

Despite the intense density of buildings typical of any urban setting, the university has been making efforts to enhance biodiversity found within the site. Newton and Arkwright, the flagship buildings of NTU, house not only staff and students, but also two peregrine falcons, which are protected under Schedule One of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In this sense, the university runs a collaborative project with the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust; since 2002, the building has been regularly used by the peregrines, who nest on a specially arranged ledge near the top of the skyscraper. The nest site, which is being publicly broadcast on the Internet, has been successfully used to raise 16 chicks between 2008 and 2012.

Newton and Arkwright&#x27;s common roof has varieties of sedum covering it. Bird species that can be found include blackbirds, song thrushes, wrens, robins and even rare black redstarts.

*Clifton Campus

Located south of Nottingham city centre, on the outskirts of Clifton Village, the area comprises 32 hectares of land in a relatively enclosed campus environment.

Biodiversity can be noticed around the campus, including a variety of species of birds, bats and insects. Habitats are also provided within areas such as The Grove, bounding the site to the north-east, comprising mature trees along the River Trent. The university&#x27;s commitment to biodiversity across all of its estates includes constant investigating into exactly what creatures share the campus with humans and how the environment can be enhanced to encourage numbers to increase, and to entice new wildlife to the campus. Future plans to help enhance biodiversity and manage the landscape have been made publicly available by the university in 2012.

*Brackenhurst Campus

Brackenhurst Campus comprises a 200-hectare scenic estate situated on the outskirts of Southwell, and is set around a former country house built in 1828.

Given its rural setting, a vast array of wildlife co-exists with staff and students; present are species and habitats such as the great crested newt, badger, European hare, ancient hedgerows, the Victorian Walled Garden (a listed Heritage site), and Sheepwalk&#x27;s pond and Wildlife Hide (Wetland Conservation Area). Webcams on campus enable the monitoring of such species and habitats.

=== UKIP Controversy ===

In late 2014, some Nottingham Trent University UKIP students attempted to form an official society for their party. The Union&#x27;s Societies Assembly voted to block the formation of this group in spite of similar Labour and Conservative societies already existing.

The situation rose to prominence in January 2015 when an article appeared on the website of Young Independence calling the ban &quot;An affront to democracy&quot; and this sentiment was echoed by UKIP&#x27;s Margot Parker MEP in a statement a few days later. Various news outlets became interested in the story, including Sky News.

On 21 January 2015 the Union admitted that some members of the Societies Assembly made their decision based on personal political beliefs and therefore overturned the ban.

NTU sports scholars have competed in the summer and winter Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games and world championships. NTU alumni include England Rugby player Nick Easter and GB Hockey players Crista Cullen and Alastair Wilson.

<text>Vindaloo or vindalho is a Goan curry dish. It is known globally in its British Indian form as a staple of curry house and Indian restaurant menus and is often regarded as a fiery, spicy dish. Vindaloo evolved from the Portuguese dish carne de vinha d&#x27;alhos. The traditional vindaloo recipe is pork, but alternative versions are also commonly used, such as beef, chicken, lamb, mutton, prawns, vegetables and tofu.

== History ==

A standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese &quot;carne de vinha d&#x27;alhos&quot; (meat in wine and garlic marinade; literally &quot;meat of vine of garlic&quot;), a vindaloo is a dish of meat marinated in vinegar and garlic. The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the Portuguese sailor&#x27;s &quot;preserved&quot; raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of alternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in red wine. This was adapted by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the red wine, and the addition of spices. It evolved into the localized and easy-to-pronounce dish &quot;vindaloo&quot;.

The British Indian version of vindaloo calls for the meat to be marinated in vinegar, sugar, fresh ginger and spices, then cooked with more spices.

== Traditional Goan preparation and Indian variations ==

Restaurants in Goa offering traditional Goan cuisine prepare vindalho with pork, which is the original recipe. Christians from Kochi, Kerala prepare it using pork or, less commonly, beef. The dish was popularized by Goan cooks (whom the British favoured, because they had no objections in kitchens and bars with handling beef, pork or alcohol) in British establishments and on ocean-going liners. Restaurants in other parts of India prepare vindaloo with other meats including beef, chicken, goat meat, lamb and seafood; local taboos against pork popularized the addition of other meats. Cubed potatoes are sometimes added to reduce preparation costs.

Even though the word &quot;aloo&quot; (आलू) means &quot;potato&quot; in Hindi, traditional Goan vindalho does not include potatoes; the name is from Portuguese with no Hindi etymology. Some Indian versions do include potatoes due to the confusion with the Hindi &quot;aloo&quot;, and vindaloo dishes outside India often include potatoes.

== Outside India ==


Vindaloo has gained popularity outside of India, where it is typically featured on menus at Indian restaurants. Vindaloo served in restaurants of the United Kingdom differs from the original vindaloo dish; it is simply a spicier version of the standard &quot;medium (spiciness)&quot; restaurant curry with the addition of vinegar, potatoes and chili peppers.

Vindaloo is one of the spiciest dishes available on British Asian menus where it is served, although British Bangladeshi restaurants have innovated the , which is a quite different dish that originated in Bangladesh. The British variation originated from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 1970s. Vindaloo is considered a predecessor to phall.

<text>The University of Reading is a public research university in Reading, Berkshire, England. It was founded in 1892 as University College, Reading, a University of Oxford extension college. The institution received the power to grant its own degrees in 1926 by royal charter from King George V and was the only university to receive such a charter between the two world wars. The university is usually categorised as a red brick university, reflecting its original foundation in the 19th century.

Reading has four major campuses. In the United Kingdom, the campuses on London Road and Whiteknights are based in the town of Reading itself, and Greenlands is based on the banks of the River Thames in Buckinghamshire. It also has a campus in Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia. The university has been arranged into 16 academic schools since 2016. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £339.2 million of which £33.7 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £257.2 million.

==History==

===University College===
The university owes its first origins to the Schools of Art and Science established in Reading in 1860 and 1870. In 1892, the &quot;College at Reading&quot; was founded as an extension college by Christ Church, a college of the University of Oxford. The first president was the geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder, and the college&#x27;s first home was the old hospitium building behind Reading Town Hall. The Schools of Art and Science were transferred to the new college by Reading Town Council in the same year.

The new college received its first treasury grant in 1901. Three years later it was given a site, now the university&#x27;s London Road Campus, by the Palmer family (connected with the firm of Huntley &amp; Palmers). The same family supported the opening of Wantage Hall in 1908 and of the Research Institute in Dairying in 1912.

===University status===
The college first applied for a royal charter in 1920 but was unsuccessful at that time. However a second petition, in 1925, was successful, and the charter was officially granted on 17 March 1926. With the charter, the college became the University of Reading, the only new university to be created in the United Kingdom between the two world wars. It was added to the Combined English Universities constituency in 1928 in time for the 1929 general election.

In 1947, the university purchased Whiteknights Park, which was to become its principal campus. In 1984, the university started a merger with Bulmershe College of Higher Education, which was completed in 1989.

===2006–present===
In October 2006, the Senior Management Board proposed the closure of its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of alternative ideas and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in Parliament over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general. On 10 October, the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the council on 20 November. Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering. The university council decided in March 2009 to close the School of Health and Social Care, a school whose courses have consistently been oversubscribed.

In January 2008, the university announced its merger with the Henley Management College to create the university&#x27;s new &quot;Henley Business School&quot;, bringing together Henley College&#x27;s expertise in MBAs with the university&#x27;s existing Business School and ICMA Centre. The merger took formal effect on 1 August 2008, with the new business school split across the university&#x27;s existing Whiteknights Campus and its new Greenlands Campus that formerly housed Henley Management College.

A restructuring of the university was announced in September 2009, which would bring together all the academic schools into three faculties, these being the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Social sciences, and Henley Business School. The move was predicted to result in the loss of some jobs, especially in the film, theatre and television department, which has since moved into a brand new £11.5 million building on Whiteknights Campus.

In late 2009 it was announced that the London Road Campus was to undergo a £30 million renovation, preparatory to becoming the new home of the university&#x27;s Institute of Education. The Institute moved to its new home in January 2012. The refurbishment was partially funded by the sale of the adjoining site of Mansfield Hall, a former hall of residence, for demolition and replacement by private sector student accommodation.

The university is a lead sponsor of UTC Reading, a new university technical college which opened in September 2013.

In 2016, a move to reorganise the structure of Reading University provoked student protests. On 21 March 2016, staff announced a vote of no confidence in the vice chancellor Sir David Bell. Eighty-eight per cent of those who voted backed the no confidence motion.

In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported the university was in &quot;a financial and governance crisis&quot; after recently reporting itself to regulators over a £121 million loan. The university is sole trustee of the charitable National Institute for Research in Dairying trust, and after selling trust land had then borrowed the £121 million proceeds from the trust, despite the potential conflict of interest in the decision making. Including this loan, the university has debts of £300 million, as well as having an operating deficit of over £40 million for the past two years.

In 2021, the university declared, in a statement reply to the student&#x27;s union, that it would not refund tuition fees for its students.

==Campuses==


The university maintains over of grounds, in four distinct campuses:

===Whiteknights===
Whiteknights Campus, at , is the largest and includes Whiteknights Lake, conservation meadows and woodlands as well as most of the university&#x27;s departments. Though within the Reading urban area, most of the campus actually falls within Wokingham District (parish of Earley). The campus takes its name from the nickname of the 13th century knight John De Erleigh IV or the &#x27;White Knight&#x27;, and was landscaped in the 18th century by the Marquis of Blandford. The main university library, in the middle of the campus, holds nearly a million books and subscribes to around 4,000 periodicals. The URS building, designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge &amp; Amis in concrete brutalist style in the 1970s is Grade II listed. The Whiteknights campus was voted one of the best green spaces in the United Kingdom for the seventh year running in the 2017 Green Flag People&#x27;s Choice awards.

===London Road===
The smaller London Road Campus is the original university site and is closer to the town centre of Reading, sited across from the Royal Berkshire Hospital. The London Road site is home to The Institute of Education – a major provider of teacher training in the UK. The Institute moved to its new home in January 2012 after the campus was refurbished at a cost of £30 million. The London Road site also plays host to the university graduation ceremonies twice a year, in the Great Hall.

===Greenlands===
The Greenlands Campus, on the banks of the River Thames in Buckinghamshire. Once the home of William Henry Smith, son of the founder of WH Smith, and latterly the site of the Henley Management College, this campus became part of the university on 1 August 2008, with the merger of that college with the university&#x27;s Business School to form the &quot;Henley Business School&quot;. The school&#x27;s MBA and corporate learning offerings will be based at Greenlands, with undergraduate and other postgraduate courses being based at Whiteknights.

===Malaysia===
An Asian campus at Iskandar, Malaysia was formally opened in February 2016. It offers a range of professional programmes at foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate levels including the Henley Business School MBA. First announced in October 2012, it is the university&#x27;s first overseas campus. The project was overseen by Tony Downes. Professor Wing Lam took over as Provost in May 2018 after the retirement of Tony Downes and restructured the campus to enable it to focus on core professional disciplines that were aligned with the region&#x27;s need for talent.

===Other sites===
The former Bulmershe Court Campus in Woodley was the site of the former Bulmershe Teaching College, which merged with The University of Reading in 1989. The campus was sold in January 2014 as the university decided to concentrate its activity on its three other campuses. It had previously moved all teaching and research at Bulmershe either to Whiteknights or to London Road, and closed the student accommodation.

The university also owns of farmland in the nearby villages of Arborfield, Sonning and Shinfield. These support a mixed farming system including dairy cows, ewes and beef animals, and host research centres of which the flagship is the Centre for Dairy Research.

As part of the proposed Whiteknights Development Plan in Autumn 2007, the university proposed spending up to £250 million on its estates over 30 years, principally to focus academic activities onto the Whiteknights site. The university also announced its intention to site some functions on the London Road site, and proposed a complete withdrawal from Bulmershe Court by 2012, which was accomplished.

===Museums, libraries and botanical gardens===

Reading University maintains four museums, the main campus library, a range of inter-departmental libraries, and a botanical garden. The largest and best known of these museums is the Museum of English Rural Life, which has recently relocated from a location on Whiteknights Campus to a site nearer the town centre next to the London Road Campus. The Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology, the Cole Museum of Zoology, the University of Reading Herbarium and the Harris Garden are all on the Whiteknights Campus. The Department of Typography and Graphic Communication holds a number of lettering, printing and graphic design collections including those of Isotype, Ephemera, printing presses, Twentieth-century posters, non-Latin typefaces and the archive of partners Banks and Miles.

The University Library at Whiteknights makes available over 1 million physical resources, as well as a range of electronic online resources, from 14,000 square metres of space across seven floors. The secondary site library at the university&#x27;s Bulmershe campus closed in 2011 and its operative collections were transferred. There is also a library in the university&#x27;s Meteorology department.

The library underwent refurbishment costing £40 million starting in 2016 and was re-opened in autumn 2019. The redevelopment aimed to improve the energy efficiency of the building with the installation of new windows, cladding and roofing. New lifts, additional study seating capacity, a larger Library cafe with an outside seating area, more toilets (including disabled and gender-neutral provision) and card-access security barriers were also part of the refurbishment programme.

===Graduate school===
The university-wide Graduate School is a faculty providing training and a range of support for doctoral researchers and related staff across the other four faculties.

===Governing bodies and roles===
The university is nominally led by a chancellor, who is the titular head of the university and is normally a well-known public figure. The day-to-day chief executive role is the responsibility of the vice-chancellor, a full-time academic post. The senior management board of the university is headed by the vice-chancellor, assisted by a deputy-vice-chancellor, three pro-vice-chancellors, four deans and five heads of directorate. It is responsible for the day-to-day management of the university and meets fortnightly throughout most of the year.

The senior management board reports to the university&#x27;s Senate, the main academic administrative body. The senate has around 100 members and meets at least four times a year and advises on areas such as student entry, assessment and awards. Membership includes deans, heads and elected representatives of schools, as well as professional staff and students. The Senate in turn reports to the Council, which is the supreme governing body of the university, setting strategic direction, ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and approving constitutional changes. The Council meets four times a year and comprises a broad representation of lay members drawn from commercial, community and professional organisations.

On 24 March 2016, it was announced that William Waldegrave was to be the new chancellor of Reading University. Lord Waldegrave is the fourth Conservative politician to be appointed chancellor of the university, following Austen Chamberlain, Sir Samuel Hoare and Lord Carrington. Waldegrave&#x27;s predecessor, Sir John Madejski is also a supporter of, and contributor to, the Conservative Party.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Reading had a total income of £339.2 million (2022/23 – £321.9 million) and total expenditure of £257.2 million (2022/23 – £325.7 million). Key sources of income included £198.8 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £186.9 million), £32 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £36.5 million), £33.7 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £34 million), £9.6 million from investment income (2022/23 – £7.4 million) and £4.1 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £4.9 million).

At year end, Reading had endowments of £111.4 million (2023 – £101.9 million) and total net assets of £533.6 million (2023 – £453.2 million). It holds the thirteenth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

Between 2009 and 2010, the university was beset by controversy, with the closure of departments and job losses among staff. The university lost 7.7% of its HEFCE funding in fiscal year 2010–2011. In 2016 a move to reorganise the structure of Reading University provoked protests.

==Academic profile==
===Admissions===

New students entering the university in 2020 had an average of 129 points (the equivalent of ABB at A Level). According to the 2023 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 13% of Reading&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools.

===Reputation and rankings===
Departments in the university have been awarded the biannual Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education five times: in 1998, in the Humanities, Social Sciences and Law category, for work on Shakespeare; in 2005, in the Environment category; in 2008, again in Humanities, Social Sciences and Law; in 2011, for &quot;teaching and design applications in typography, through print and new technologies&quot; in Typography &amp; Graphic Communication; and in 2021, again in the category of Environment And Conservation, for &quot;connecting communities with climate change&quot; through &quot;new modelling work on the interaction between the Earth’s climate and local weather systems, enabling the development of risk assessment, community preparedness and action to tackle climate change.&quot;

Reading was ranked 35th in the UK amongst multi-faculty institutions for the quality (GPA) of its research and 28th for its Research Power in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. In total, 98% of the university&#x27;s research is labelled as &#x27;internationally recognised&#x27;, 78% as &#x27;internationally excellent and 27% as &#x27;world leading&#x27;.

Its School of Agriculture Policy and Development was ranked top in the UK and 11th in the world, according to the QS classification of universities by subject.

Reading has been highly ranked in meteorology and atmospheric science. In the 2023 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects, it was ranked 5th in the world for atmospheric science. It was ranked 15th in the world for Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2024 and 13th among global universities in atmospheric science in the 2024 SCImago Institutions Rankings.
It was ranked 2nd in the world in meteorology and atmospheric sciences by the Center for World University Rankings in 2017 (the most recent year subject rankings were published).

===Affiliated institutions===
The Gyosei International College in the U.K. was established on property acquired from the University of Reading in 1989. The college, later renamed Witan International College, was acquired by the University of Reading in 2004. Witan College closed in 2008.

In 2009 the university partnered with the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology to offer Chinese students courses taught by the department of chemistry. In 2015 this was expanded to form the NUIST Reading Academy which currently offers six degree programs and enrolls nearly 400 students annually.

==Student life==
===Students’ Union===
Reading University Students&#x27; Union (RUSU) is the affiliated student organisation which represents the students&#x27; interests. The university also has a number of Junior Common Rooms that are linked to the Students&#x27; Union. The Students&#x27; Union has been the launchpad for many successful careers including Penny Mordaunt (Former MP for Portsmouth North), who was the 1994–5 president of the Students&#x27; Union.

The Students&#x27; Union runs the student radio station. It broadcasts locally from the Whiteknights campus in university retail outlets and over an internet live stream on a full-time basis. The station was formed in 1997 and started broadcasting in 2001 on 1287AM and transferred to solely online in 2007. It also publishes the Spark, a newspaper aimed at the student population of the university, which is published fortnightly during term-time only and student television station RU:ON.

The union provides a free advice service to students, and facilitates over 160 different activities for students to get involved in. The Students&#x27; Union building on Whiteknights Campus contains a 2500 capacity venue called 3sixty (recently renovated in 2018), with seven bars, and a number of retail outlets. The retail outlets include an Asian supermarket, a Starbucks and a hairdressers.

===Halls and accommodation===

Student accommodation is provided in a number of halls of residence offering a mix of partially catered (19 meals per week) and self-catering accommodation, along with other self-catering accommodation. Following a major review the university is now proceeding with the integrated Halls and Catering Strategy, that will see several halls replaced as well as new ones created with social, catering &amp; welfare facilities provided in hub areas. Most of the halls of residence lie close to the northern campus periphery and in residential areas close by.

Wantage Hall is the second oldest purpose-built hall in England outside of Oxford and Cambridge, opening a year after Hulme Hall at the University of Manchester, and is built in the style of an &#x27;Oxbridge&#x27; college.

St. Andrews Hall closed in 2000 and is now the home of the Museum of English Rural Life.

St. George&#x27;s Hall and the Reading Student Village (renamed Benyon) are leased back to the university from UPP. The cost of leasing back the Student Village to the university, according to the university accounts, was £1.3 million in 2002–03 and £1.5 million for 2003–04.

In 2011 the management of the mature and international halls, Hillside and Martindale, was taken over by the &quot;Estates management team&quot;, as was Bulmershe Hall in 2012, the sale of which was finalised in 2014. In the same year the new Kendrick Halls were opened on the ground of halls which had not been in use for many years. These are not managed by the university.

==Working with business==
Reading hosts a number of private sector businesses on its campuses, either occupying dedicated buildings or in managed space at the Science &amp; Technology Centre or Enterprise Hub.

===Science &amp; Technology Centre===
The University of Reading Science &amp; Technology Centre is situated on the eastern side of Whiteknights Campus. The Science &amp; Technology Centre supports and accommodates technology companies from start-up through to larger SMEs.

Notable companies currently or previously based at the Science &amp; Technology Centre include Reading Scientific Services Ltd.

===Reading Enterprise Hub===
Reading Enterprise Hub is a business incubator opened in 2003. The hub was jointly sponsored by the university and SEEDA, and sought to attract startup high tech companies, particularly those with interests in environmental technology, information technology, life sciences, and materials science.

The hub was originally situated in World War II-era temporary office buildings on the university&#x27;s Whiteknights campus. During the summer of 2008, the hub was demolished, along with the neighbouring former agriculture buildings, and the remaining tenants relocated to a building on the London Road campus. As of April 2010, a new Reading Enterprise Centre is being constructed on the hub&#x27;s original site.

<text>Bryansk Oblast (), also known as Bryanshchina (, ), is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Bryansk. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 1,169,161.

==Geography==

Bryansk Oblast lies in western European Russia in the central to western parts of the East European Plain, on the divide between the Desna and Volga basins. The oblast borders with Smolensk Oblast in the north, Kaluga Oblast in the northeast, Oryol Oblast in the east, Kursk Oblast in the southeast, Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts of Ukraine in the south, and with Gomel and Mogilev Oblasts of Belarus in the west.

Natural resources include deposits of peat, sand, clay, chalk, marl, and other building materials, as well as phosphorite. About a quarter of the total area of the oblast is covered by forests, mainly coniferous, mixed, and deciduous, as well as forest-steppe.

Bryansky Les Nature Reserve is a biosphere reserve that protects, among other things, a limited population of European bison.

===Ecology===
As a result of the Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986, part of the territory of Bryansk Oblast (mainly Gordeyevsky, Klimovsky, Klintsovsky, Krasnogorsky, Surazhsky, and Novozybkovsky Districts) has been contaminated with radionuclides. In 1999, some 226,000 people, representing approximately 16% of the oblast&#x27;s population, lived in areas with the contamination level above 5 Curie/km2.

==History==
The Venus of Eliseevichi is a piece of Paleolithic art (dated to 14,000 YBP) found in the region. The Eliseevichi site is also associated with the earliest recognized dog remains, dating to 15,000 YBP.

In the 9th to 11th centuries AD Slavic tribes lived along the banks of the Desna River and in the forests of the land between the Desna and the Oka. The city of Bryansk was established in 985.

Bryansk remained poorly attested until the 1237-1242 Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;. It was the northernmost of the Severian cities in the possession of the Chernigov Rurikids and the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk. After the Mongols murdered Prince Mikhail of Chernigov in 1246 and his capital was destroyed, his son Roman Mikhailovich moved his seat to Bryansk. In 1310, when the Mongols sacked the town again, it belonged to the principality of Smolensk. After the Mongols took Chernigov, the Principality of Bryansk was formed. In 1356 Bryansk territory was under the authority of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
The Great Duchy of Moscow conquered Bryansk following the Battle of Vedrosha in 1503. The town was turned into a fortress that played a major role during the Time of Troubles of 1598–1613. Bryansk became Moscow&#x27;s south-western outpost in the fights against Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Kingdom of Poland, and Crimean Khanate. In 1618 the Truce of Deulino saw the southern and western area of the modern Bryansk Oblast ceded to Poland.

After the annexation of the lands by the Tsardom of Russia in 1654, all the left bank of the Dnieper, including the south-western area of Bryansk, was divided into hundreds of administrative regiments. One of the largest was Starodub. In 1781, these regiments merged into districts and several territories.

Peter the Great () incorporated Bryansk into the Kiev Governorate, but Empress Catherine the Great deemed it wise to transfer the town to the Oryol Governorate in 1779. She also promulgated the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

In 1709, part of the Bryansk (Bryansky, Karachevsky, Sevsky, and Trubchevsky Uyezds) belonged to Kiev Governorate. In 1727, became part of the newly formed Belgorod Governorate.

The 17th and 18th centuries saw a period of significant regional economic development. The industrial revolution began in the 18th century, particularly in the eastern part of Bryansk; due to its reserves of sand Bryansk saw the growth of the glass industry.
On April 1, 1920, Bryansk Oblast was established but on October 1, 1929 it was incorporated into the Western Oblast. On September 27, 1937, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union decided to abolish the Western Krai, dividing it into Smolensk and Oryol Oblasts. The current territory of Bryansk Oblast became a part of Oryol Oblast.

In August–October 1941 Axis troops took over the region. From the first days of occupation, the struggle against the invaders took on the character of a popular movement. In the Bryansk area about 60,000 guerrillas from the guerrilla units of Sydir Kovpak, Oleksiy Fedorov and Alexander Saburov operated. The fighting resulted in the destruction and burning of many towns and villages, affecting some 111,000 homes and many important industrial enterprises. After the Red Army liberated the area (August–September 1943), extensive restoration work commenced.

A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR established the modern Bryansk Oblast on July 5, 1944. On 4 July 1997, Bryansk, alongside Chelyabinsk, Magadan, Saratov, and Vologda, signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The power-sharing would be abolished on 9 August 2002.

On 2 March 2023, the villages of Lyubechane and Sushany were attacked by pro-Ukrainian forces during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Administrative divisions==
==Economy==

===Transportation===

A large railway junction is located in the capital of Bryansk. Most rail lines in the oblast are electrified, using AC power.
In connection with the border situation, Bryansk there are several major customs terminals.

The oblast is crossed by the M3 Moscow—Kiev highway and the M13 Bryansk-Novozybkov-Boundary Belarus—(Kobrin), and fourteen kilometers from the administrative center of the oblast is the Bryansk International Airport.

=== Exports ===

==Politics==

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the First Secretary of the Bryansk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the Chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, the CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside an elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Bryansk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Bryansk Oblast Duma is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter under the Constitution of Russia.

The current governor of Bryansk Oblast since 2015 is Alexander Bogomaz, a member of the United Russia party. He was re-elected in 2020, winning 71.7% of the vote.

== Sights ==
&quot;&#x27;Church of the Ascension in the village of Veliky Bor&#x27;&quot;

The supplier on the hill of intermediaries is the compositional center of his development. Year of construction of the church (by order of Count Bezborodko) - 1809. By now, the side porticos and the top of the bell tower have been lost. An interesting example of a cross-shaped manor church in the style of mature classicism. Around the building were comparatively short sidearms, which were slightly protruding rectangular altars ending in a lowered semicircular apse.

The originality of the composition is given by a large light quadrangle towering over the center with a tetrahedral dome cover and a small dome on a cubic pedestal. A small refectory with one window on the side facades is adjoined by a preserved quadrangle of the bell tower. A profiled belt bypasses all facades of the building at the level of the apse cornice. Four Tuscan pilasters decorating the ends of the side arms correspond to the columns of the lost porticoes.

Between them, in the center, there are side entrances marked with triangular sandrids, and on the sides - rectangular windows. Above the openings, there are, respectively, an oval and two round niches. A large semicircular three-part Empire-type window is cut in the upper part of each quadrangle facet. The tier of the bell tower is decorated with large flat-arched niches in the center of the facets, rusticated corner parts to the waist, and round niches-medallions above it. In the interior, all the side parts are completely open into the high central one, forming a single space of the temple.

The central part is covered with a four-lane closed vault, the altar is covered with a conch, and the altar vima, the side arms, and the refectory are covered with cylindrical vaults. The lower tier of the bell tower with rounded inner corners has a corrugated vault along the north–south axis. On the sides of the trapezoidal passage to the refectory, there are small rooms with a staircase in the southern one. Only the plaster cornices at the base of the vaults and at the top of the main quadrangle, as well as pilasters between the windows on the north and south walls, have survived from the interior decoration.

==Heraldry==

The Flag of Bryansk Oblast represents a panel burgundy with a ratio of 1:1,5. In the center of the cloth is placed the coat of arms of the Bryansk region and includes a hammer and sickle up top. The coat of arms is a blue shield representing Slavic unity between the states of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. In the upper part of the shield is a stylized golden spruce with a three-tiered crown representing the forests of Bryansk. The flag is burgundy in color, representing the color of the banners under which the army and guerrillas fought for the liberation of Bryansk.

<doc id="476476" wikidata="Q2801" url="?curid=476476" title="Bryansk">
<text>Bryansk (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Bryansk Oblast, Russia, situated on the Desna River, southwest of Moscow. It has a population of 379,152 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Based on excavations at the end of the 20th century, information was found on the birth of the city in the 10th century on the Chashin Kurgan. For ease of perception, the conventional date of birth was chosen as 985 AD.

The first written mention of Bryansk, as Debryansk, dates to 1146 in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;. The name appears variously as , and in other spellings. Etymologically, it derives from &quot;дъбръ&quot;, a Slavic word for &quot;ditch&quot;, &quot;lowland&quot;, or &quot;dense woodland&quot;; the area was known for its dense woods, of which very little remains today. Local authorities and archaeologists, however, believe that the town had existed as early as 985 as a fortified settlement on the right bank of the Desna River.

Bryansk remained poorly attested until the 1237–1242 Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;. It was the northernmost of the Severian cities in the possession of the Olgovichi clan of Chernigov. After the Mongols executed Prince Mikhail of Chernigov in 1246 and his capital was destroyed, his purported son Roman Mikhailovich moved his seat to Bryansk. In 1310, when the Mongols sacked the town again, it belonged to the Principality of Smolensk.

Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania acquired Bryansk through inheritance in 1356 and gave it to his son, Dmitry the Elder. Until the end of the century Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania, the future Grand Duke Švitrigaila of Lithuania, and Grand Duke Yury of Smolensk contested control of the town.

The Grand Duchy of Moscow conquered Bryansk following the Battle of Vedrosha in 1503. The town was turned into a fortress which played a major role during the Time of Troubles (1598–1613). During the Time of Troubles the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied the town in 1610, and it remained in Polish-Lithuanian hands as part of Smolensk Voivodeship until the Truce of Deulino in 1634. In 1709 Tsar Peter the Great incorporated Bryansk into the Kiev Governorate, but Empress Catherine the Great deemed it wise to transfer the town to the newly-formed Oryol Governorate in 1779. She also promulgated the town&#x27;s coat of arms (August 1781).

In the 17th and 18th centuries the economy of Bryansk, which had become a regional trading center, was based on the Svenskaya fair (), the largest in European Russia. The fair took place annually under the auspices of the nearby Svensky Monastery. After the town started to manufacture cannon and ammunition for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1783, Bryansk evolved from a regional market town into an important industrial center for metallurgy and textiles. The city&#x27;s population exceeded 30,000 by 1917. In 1812 Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; fought the Russians in Bryansk and in Oryol during the French invasion of Russia.

In 1918 the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic and Ukrainian People’s Republic both claimed Bryansk, but Bolshevik forces took the town in 1919. During World War II the German Wehrmacht captured Bryansk and encircled the Soviet 3rd,13th and 50th armies. The town remained under Axis occupation from October 6, 1941 to September 17, 1943, with the city left heavily damaged by fighting. About 60,000 Soviet partisans were active in and around Bryansk, inflicting heavy losses on the German Army. In 1944, soon after its liberation, Bryansk became the administrative center of Bryansk Oblast.

In 2016 the city council approved a new general city plan, which called among others for laying of a new route from Burov Street along the Bolva River to Vokzalnaya Street with the intersection of the railway and Bolva. In the southern direction, it is proposed to extend the road along the Desna to the Fokinsky District to Moskovsky Prospekt, construction of a road from the Black Bridge along the Karachizh ravine with the intersection of Stanke Dimitrova Avenue to Sakharova Street, reconstruction of Sakharova Street to the bypass road and the R120 highway, as well as development of the area of the old airport (area of Gorbatova, Stepnaya streets).

A large fire was noted at an oil depot on April 25, 2022. Speculation was that it might have been a result of military action during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

December 7, 2023 - shooting happened in gymnasium No. 5.As a result of the same shooting,two people died(including the attacker)and five were injured. Also,this shooting caused a high public result(although usually such cases mainly cause public outcry!).

==Geography==
===Urban layout===

The location of the settlement was originally associated with navigable river-routes and was located in the area of the Chashin Kurgan, where the fortress walls were erected. For reasons that have not yet been clarified, the city changed its location and by the middle of the 12th century had established itself on the steep slopes of the right bank of the Desna on Pokrovskaya Hill (). The foundations of the future urban development of the city were laid even earlier, when around the city-fortress in the 17th century after the Time of Troubles of 1598–1613 on the coastal strip at the foot of the Bryansk fortress the posadskaya &quot;Zatinnaya Sloboda&quot; was upset, and on the upper plateau, between Verkhniy Sudok and White Kolodez - the &quot;Streletskaya Sloboda&quot;.

Somewhat earlier behind the posad (the territory between the fortress and the Peter-Pavlovsky monastery), after the annexation of Bryansk to the Moscow state and the organization of the Yamskaya service in 1503, the Yamskaya Sloboda appeared. Zatinnaya Sloboda is located on the site of the ancient &quot;Zhitny Gorod&quot; - a fortified territory of food warehouses and salt storages. Later, the settlement gave way to a cannon yard, on the site of which the Arsenal was located in the 18th century.

The general plan of the city of Bryansk plan laid the foundations for the development of the city in a regular system designed to streamline the existing buildings for centuries, limit the spontaneous growth of the city, and create a new community center. In the drawing, the territory of the upper plateau was covered with a geometrical grid of quarters formed by streets going down to the Desna and perpendicular to them.

Three squares were &quot;strung&quot; on two of them: Sobornaya - on the coastal Moskovskaya street, Krasnaya gorodskaya - in the center of the plateau and Shchepnaya market - on the western border of the city (by the entrance to the present-day Dynamo stadium). The plan captures the historical layout. The city is spread out on the right bank of the Desna. It was a picturesque group of different-sized, irregularly shaped quarters. The city center did not stand out in terms of planning, it was defined by a fortress on Pokrovskaya Hill, dominating the city.

Streets descending from the upper plateau were united into one, following along the bank of the Desna. The city was almost entirely wooden, with the exception of only a few stone (mainly religious) buildings. The street network included all buildings significant at that time. The central quarters were designated for the construction of stone public, commercial and residential buildings. Red (Krasnaya) Square was to be decorated with the buildings of public offices, magistrates and commercial institutions; the market square - built up with handicraft enterprises, smithies and shops.

The plan as revised in 1802 significantly increased the territory of the city and included in the regular system not only the coastal area and the area between Sudki, but also the Petrovskaya Gora area and Yamskaya Sloboda with Forest Sheds in the north and north-east, the area between the White Kolodez ravine and the Podar River on south; it increased the territory of the central part in the northwest behind the market square. The quarters were enlarged, the streets classified, and squares located on a larger scale to the territory of the city.

Smolenskaya Street - in common parlance Rozhdestvenskaya Gora (now Sovetskaya Street - Gagarin Boulevard) - is the main highway connecting the upland part with the coastal one. It connects three squares: Cathedral, Red and Sennaya (former Shchepnaya). Two other highways run in the longitudinal direction: Bolshaya Moskovskaya (now Kalinin Street) in the coastal part and Petropavlovskaya-Voskresenskaya Street (now Lenin Avenue), which unites the city in the upland part.

Petropavlovskaya and Voskresenskaya streets, continuing it, crossing the whole city, at the intersection with Trubchevskaya (now Krasnoarmeyskaya) street ended in a new, fourth square - Khlebnaya (on the site of the modern Partizanskaya Square, there was once a mill on this place). From here there were roads to Trubchevsk and Karachev. All squares were square. At the beginning of the 19th century, out of 867 houses in the city, only 25 were of stone; out of 17 stone churches there were 10. A little more than a dozen buildings built in the second half of the 18th century have survived to this day.

The unique architectural silhouette of the city, which was formed by the beginning of the 19th century, was skilfully expanded and enlarged by the end of the century. In the center, on the territory of the Spaso-Polikarpov Monastery, the Novopokrovsky Cathedral was erected (1862–1897), which emphasized the planning center of the district town with its scale. On the right flank there was a building of a trade and craft school, built by the architect N. A. Lebedev, which linked the building of the Arsenal plant and the Tikhvin church into a single chain of historical buildings.
The first isographic depiction of the city is a 1857 panorama from the left bank of the Desna, painted in watercolor by self-taught artist Gabriel Vasilyevich Khludov, a draftsman of the Bryansk Arsenal. In the center of the picture is Pokrovskaya Hill with the stone church of the same name and a bell tower, at the bottom right of the Arsenal building, then the Resurrection, Nikolskaya and Trinity churches, the ensemble of the Peter-Pavlovsky Monastery, and in the foreground - the Ascension Church of the Zaretskaya Sloboda.

It is not definitively known when the first Bryansk fortress appeared as a long-term fortification. The reports of the governor of 1629, and paintings from 1678, 1682, 1685, 1686 testify that the fortress on Pokrovskaya Hill was cut down, like in the old days, from oak logs and consisted of walls with towers. Inventories noted that the fortress was built on a native mountain. The city - &quot;oak, chopped, covered with planks&quot; - included a system of blind and drive-through towers connected by walls, supplemented by embankments and a wooden &quot;standing prison in one log&quot;.

The fortress had towers: Spasskaya, Arkhangelskaya, Bezymyannaya, Bushuevskaya, the first and second Voskresensky, Nikolskaya, Pyatnitskaya, Rukavnaya, Sudkovskaya, Prechistenskaya, Rozhdestvenskaya, Georgievskaya, Karachevskaya and Tainichnaya. The fortress of the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; cities had a certain number of towers and a different amount of weapons.

The fortress was described at the beginning of the 18th century: &quot;an ancient fortress in the city of Bryansk occupied the top of a small mountain, but with rather steep slopes and, in terms of its position relative to the city located on the right bank of the Desna, constituted a citadel. Its fortified fence was in an irregular quadrangle, at the corners of which there were small ledges. They were joined by a chain retransmission, placed on one of the ledges of a raised area.&quot;

===Climate===

<text>Jackson Volney Scholz (March 15, 1897 – October 26, 1986) was an American sprint runner. In the 1920s, he became the first person to appear in an Olympic sprint final in three different Olympic Games. After his athletic career, he also gained fame as a writer.

Born to Susan and Zachary Scholz in Buchanan, Michigan, Jackson Scholz, nicknamed &quot;The New York Thunderbolt&quot;, competed for the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri (where he joined Kappa Alpha Order), and later the New York Athletic Club. While quite successful in the Olympics, he won only a single national title, the 220 yards AAU title in 1925.

His first Olympic appearance was in Antwerp in 1920, where he won a gold medal with the American 4 × 100 m relay team. Individually he placed fourth in the 100 m. Later that year, Scholz equaled the World Record in the 100 m, running 10.6 s in Stockholm.

Four years later, he was one of the favorites for the sprint titles in the 100 and 200 m. He lived up to the expectations in the 200 m, but was beaten to the gold in the 100 m by Britain&#x27;s Harold Abrahams. The 100 m race, and the 400 m race won by Eric Liddell, are depicted in the movie &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, which was released in 1981 – five years before Scholz&#x27;s death at the age of 89. He was played in the film by actor Brad Davis.

Scholz made a third Olympic appearance in 1928. As the reigning champion, he placed fourth in the 200 m.

During the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, an American Express credit card commercial (&quot;Don&#x27;t leave home without it&quot;) included Ben Cross and the 87-year-old Scholz. When Cross—who portrayed Abrahams in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;—said something about beating Scholz, the latter remarked, &quot;&quot;You&quot; didn&#x27;t beat me!&quot; with mock indignation. Proving he was &quot;still pretty fast,&quot; Scholz beat Cross to the draw in picking up the tab with his credit card.

<text>Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie is an epic poem by the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, written in English and published in 1847. The poem follows an Acadian girl named Evangeline and her search for her lost love Gabriel during the Expulsion of the Acadians (1755–1764).

The idea for the poem came from Longfellow&#x27;s friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. Longfellow used dactylic hexameter, imitating Greek and Latin classics. Though the choice was criticized, it became Longfellow&#x27;s most famous work in his lifetime and remains one of his most popular and enduring works.

The poem had a powerful effect in defining both Acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It represents lost loved ones and heartbreak but also keeping hope. While Longfellow was a poet, not a historian, twenty-first century scholarship has included those who chose to expound their view that Longfellow&#x27;s work fails as a scientific historical document.

==Plot==
&quot;Evangeline&quot; describes the betrothal of a fictional Acadian girl named Evangeline Bellefontaine to her beloved, Gabriel Lajeunesse, and their separation as the British deport the Acadians from Acadie in the Great Upheaval.

== Composition and publication history ==
Longfellow was introduced to the true story of the Acadians in Nova Scotia by his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was told a story of separated Acadian lovers by Boston minister Rev. Horace Conolly, who heard it from his parishioners. Hawthorne and Longfellow had attended Bowdoin College together, though they were not friends at the time. Years later, in 1837, Hawthorne contacted Longfellow for his opinion on his recently published tales in the &quot;North American Review&quot;, which Longfellow praised as works of genius; the two became lifelong friends. Hawthorne was not interested in fictionalizing Conolly&#x27;s idea, because, as he told Conolly, &quot;It is not in my vein: there are no strong lights and heavy shadows.&quot; Longfellow took the idea and turned it into a poem after months of studying the histories of Nova Scotian families.

Longfellow, who had never visited the setting of the true story, relied heavily on Thomas Chandler Haliburton&#x27;s &quot;An Historical and Statistical Account of Nova Scotia&quot; and other books for further background information. He noted his reliance on other sources in his journal on January 7, 1847: &quot;Went to the library and got Watson&#x27;s Annals of Philadelphia, and the Historical Collections of Pennsylvania. Also, Darby&#x27;s Geographical Description of Louisiana. These books must help me through the last part of &quot;Evangeline&quot;, so far as facts and local coloring go. But for the form and the poetry,—they must come from my own brain.&quot;

&quot;Evangeline&quot; was published in book form on November 1, 1847 by William D. Ticknor &amp; Co., and by 1857 it had sold nearly 36,000 copies. During this time, Longfellow&#x27;s literary payment was at its peak; for &quot;Evangeline&quot;, he received &quot;a net of twenty-five and sixteenths per cent&quot; royalties, believed to be an all-time high for a poet. Longfellow said of his poem: &quot;I had the fever a long time burning in my own brain before I let my hero take it. &#x27;Evangeline&#x27; is so easy for you to read, because it was so hard for me to write.&quot;

==Analysis==
The poem is written in unrhymed dactylic hexameter, possibly inspired by Greek and Latin classics, including Homer, whose work Longfellow was reading at the time he was writing &quot;Evangeline&quot;. He also had recently, in 1841, translated &quot;The Children of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, a poem by Swedish writer Esaias Tegnér, which also used this meter. &quot;Evangeline&quot; is one of the few nineteenth-century compositions in that meter which is still read today.

Some criticized Longfellow&#x27;s choice of dactylic hexameter, including poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who said the poem would have been better in a prose style similar to Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Longfellow was conscious of the potential criticism. When sending a copy of the poem to Bryan Procter, Longfellow wrote: &quot;I hope you will not reject it on account of the meter. In fact, I could not write it &quot;as it is&quot; in any other; it would have changed its character entirely to have put it into a different measure.&quot; Even Longfellow&#x27;s wife Fanny defended his choice, writing to a friend: &quot;It enables greater richness of expression than any other, and it is sonorous like the sea which is ever sounding in Evangeline&#x27;s ear.&quot; As an experiment, Longfellow reassured himself that he was using the best meter by attempting a passage in blank verse. Even so, while looking over the proofs for a second edition, Longfellow briefly wished he had used a different poetic structure:
The name &quot;Evangeline&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;evangelium&quot; meaning &quot;gospel&quot;. The Latin word itself is derived from the Greek words &quot;eu&quot;—&quot;good&quot;—and &quot;angela&quot;—&quot;news&quot;.

==Prologue==
Longfellow does not explicitly title the opening three stanzas as the prologue, but publishers generally treat these lines as such. The poem&#x27;s story begins with the end. The French farmers and fishermen who once inhabited the colony of Acadie in Nova Scotia are gone; the moss-covered trees and the ocean are left to tell the tale.

==Critical response==
&quot;Evangeline&quot; became Longfellow&#x27;s most famous work in his lifetime and was widely read. It has been called the first important long poem in American literature. Contemporary reviews were very positive. A reviewer for &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot; said, &quot;No one with any pretensions to poetic feeling can read its delicious portraiture of rustic scenery and of a mode of life long since defunct, without the most intense delight&quot;. Longfellow&#x27;s friend Charles Sumner said he had met a woman who &quot;has read &#x27;Evangeline&#x27; some twenty times and thinks it the most perfect poem in the language&quot;. Other admirers of the poem included King Leopold I of Belgium. Speaking privately, all of Longfellow&#x27;s literary associates but Whittier attacked the piece, including his old friend John Neal, who wrote: &quot;You really ought to be hanged–drawn and quartered&quot; for writing in hexameter.

== Influence ==

Prior to the influence of Longfellow&#x27;s poem, historians generally focused on the founding of Halifax (1749) as the beginning of Nova Scotian history. Longfellow&#x27;s poem shed light on the 150 years of Acadian settlement that preceded the establishment of Halifax.

The Expulsion was planned and executed by the British and New England authorities. Longfellow omitted from the poem New England&#x27;s involvement in the expulsion. Through his poem, Longfellow defines America as a place of refuge for the exiled Acadians. Longfellow&#x27;s account was later challenged by historian Francis Parkman, in his book &quot;Montcalm and Wolfe&quot; (1884). Parkman claimed the real reason for the expulsion was the &quot;influence&quot; held by the French over the Acadians, particularly by Abbé Jean-Louis Le Loutre. American historian John Brebner eventually wrote &quot;New England&#x27;s Outpost&quot; (1927), which identified how instrumental New Englanders were in the expulsion of the Acadians.

The poem had a powerful impact in defining both Acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. More recent scholarship has revealed both the historical misconceptions in the poem and the complexity of the Expulsion and those involved, which the poem obscures. For example, Longfellow&#x27;s poem depicts Acadia as a utopia and the Acadians as a homogeneous and passive people who are incapable of violence, which ignores the efforts of resistance leader Joseph Broussard and the extensive military history of the Acadians. The poem also allowed for generations of Protestant Anglo-Americans to sympathize with the plight of the Acadians while maintaining anti-Catholic viewpoints. The poem also provided a safe symbolic space for Acadians to develop arguments for more recognition and respect in the United States.

=== Landmarks and statues ===
In 1920, at Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia, Acadians reconstructed the French church with a statue of Evangeline in the courtyard. Almost a decade later, in 1929, a statue of Evangeline, posed for by silent Mexican film star Dolores del Río, who starred in the 1929 film &quot;Evangeline&quot;, was donated to the town of St. Martinville, Louisiana, by the film&#x27;s cast and crew. In 1934, the first state park in Louisiana was named the Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site.

Felix Voorhies wrote the book &quot;Acadian Reminiscences: The True Story of Evangeline&quot; and other later works of fiction expanded upon the material of the poem, claiming the &quot;real names&quot; of the characters had been &quot;Emmeline LaBiche&quot; (in Longfellow, her full name is Evangeline Bellefontaine) and &quot;Louis Arceneaux&quot; (in the poem, Gabriel Lajeunesse) Lafayette, Louisiana, which supposedly belonged to Gabriel, and the grave of Emmeline in the Perpetual Adoration Garden &amp; Historic Cemetery in St. Martin de Tours Church Square, on Main Street, St. Martinville (the site having been determined for its convenience by local boosters about the turn of the 20th century). &quot;Evangeline Oak&quot; trees in St. Martinville also lay claim to marking the original meeting place of Emmeline and Louis.

Another site claiming to have relation to the historical figures that &quot;Evangeline&quot; was based upon is the Arceneaux House in Hamshire, Texas, which is marked by a Texas Historical Marker. The house was given to Mary Gadrac Arceneaux, great-great-granddaughter of Louis Arceneaux by her husband.

=== Place names ===
&quot;Evangeline&quot; has also been the namesake of many places in Louisiana and the Canadian Maritime Provinces. It is also often used as a street name in Acadian communities.

==== Louisiana ====
In Louisiana, places named Evangeline include:
* Evangeline Parish, Louisiana
* Evangeline, Louisiana, a community in Acadia Parish where the first oil well in Louisiana was drilled
* Evangeline Hall, a residence hall built in 1936 at Louisiana State University

==== Canada ====
Places named Evangeline in Canada include, for example:
* Evangeline, Gloucester County, New Brunswick
* Evangeline-Miscouche, a rural community in Prince Edward Island
* Evangeline, a community within Greater Moncton in Westmorland County, New Brunswick

The Evangeline Trail is a historic route in Nova Scotia that traces the Annapolis Valley, ancestral home of the Acadians. The scenic trail is lined by more than a dozen small Acadian villages, running from Grand-Pré, site of the first expulsions, south to Annapolis Royal near the Habitation at Port-Royal, historic site of the original French settlement in North America. The Evangeline Trail ends in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia on the southwest coast.

=== Film ===
There have also been numerous film adaptations of the poem &quot;Evangeline&quot;. &quot;Evangeline&quot; was the first Canadian feature film, produced in 1913 by Canadian Bioscope of Halifax. It was shot in the Annapolis Valley and at Grand-Pré. In 1919, Raoul Walsh made a film based on the poem for 20th Century Fox. It was suggested by and starred his wife Miriam Cooper. The film was one of the duo&#x27;s biggest hits but is now lost. In 1929, Edwin Carewe made a film version starring Dolores del Río, shot in Louisiana and accompanied by a theme song written by Al Jolson and Billy Rose.

The poem was mentioned in the 1987 film &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, starring Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro. &quot;Evangeline&quot; is also referenced in the 2009 Disney film &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, wherein a Cajun firefly named Raymond falls in love with Evangeline, who appears as a star. Following his death, they are reunited and appear side by side in the night sky.

=== Music and musical theatre ===
&quot;Evangeline&quot; has been the subject of numerous songs:
* A popular song in French titled &quot;Evangeline&quot; was written in 1971 by Michel Conte. Originally sung by Isabelle Pierre, a version performed by Annie Blanchard won the ADISQ award for most popular song in 2006.
* Robbie Robertson of The Band wrote the song &quot;Evangeline&quot;, performed with Emmylou Harris. In his lyrics, Evangeline is a girl from the Maritimes who awaits her absent lover in Louisiana, but the storyline and time period differ from Longfellow&#x27;s original. Another Robertson song, &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot; from 1975, was also influenced by Longfellow&#x27;s poem.
* A half-hour suite of guitar music by guitarist and composer Loren Mazzacane Connors, based on scenes in the Longfellow story, was released as a compact disc titled &quot;Evangeline&quot; (RoadCone, 1998), with a title track vocal by Suzanne Langille.
* Indie folk artist Tony Halchak released an EP titled &quot;A Tale of Acadie&quot; in 2011, based on the poem but told from Gabriel&#x27;s point of view.

The poem was first adapted into a theatrical musical in 1874, as &quot;Evangeline; or, The Belle of Acadia&quot;, which was a Broadway success through the late 19th century.

The Canadian folk singer-songwriter Susan Crowe mentions the &quot;statue of Evangeline&quot; in her song &quot;Your One and Only Life&quot;, the first track on an album entitled &quot;The Door to the River&quot; released in 1996.

A 1999 adaptation by Paul Taranto and Jamie Wax, &quot;Evangeline: The Musical&quot;, resulted in a 1999 cast album, and a Shreveport, Louisiana production of this version was broadcast in 2000 by PBS.

A 2013 musical adaptation, by Canadian Ted Dykstra, premiered in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and was revived in 2015 in Prince Edward Island and in Alberta at Edmonton&#x27;s Citadel Theatre. The production featured Brent Carver as the father.

Otto Luening&#x27;s three-act opera &quot;Evangeline&quot; premiered at Columbia University in New York City in 1948.

An opera based on &quot;Evangeline&quot;, composed by Colin Doroschuk, debuted in 2012 in reduced concert form, and was first performed in full in 2014 at Opéra-Théâtre de Rimouski. Doroschuk had previously been a member, with his brothers, of the Canadian pop band Men Without Hats.

Edmonton Opera&#x27;s Brian Deedrick directed an original musical version of &quot;Evangeline&quot;, written by playwright Winn Bray and composer Tom Doyle, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, for the Mount Royal College theatre, in 2000.

The poem was mentioned by the band Highly Suspect in the closing song of their 2022 album &quot;The Midnight Demon Club&quot;. The song is titled Evangeline after the poem, and mentions the characters: &quot;Call me Gabriel and you&#x27;re my Evangeline&quot;

=== Other ===
* The opening phrase of the poem, &quot;This is the forest primeval&quot;, has entered the cultural lexicon.
* The Evangeline League operated as a minor-league baseball circuit (primarily in Louisiana) in the 1930s, 40s and 50s.
* A depiction of Evangeline from Longfellow&#x27;s poem was incorporated into the Dominion Atlantic Railway logo along with the text &quot;Land of Evangeline Route&quot;. Additionally, there was once a Via Rail train known as the &quot;Evangeline&quot; that ran from Halifax to Yarmouth, but it ended in 1990.
* VIA Rail’s “Evangeline Park” a passenger dome / observation / sleeping car. All but one of these Park Cars can be traced to Canadian National or Provincial parks, except for Evangeline Park. Information from Ian Thom&#x27;s book &quot;Murals from a Great Canadian Train&quot; suggest that it was named for the Evangeline Memorial Park established by the Dominion Atlantic Railway, which is now the Grand Pré National Historic Site in Nova Scotia.
* &quot;L&#x27;Évangeline&quot; was also an important daily newspaper in New Brunswick, from 1887 to 1982.
* Evangeline Downs is a horse racing track located near Lafayette, Louisiana.
* The 1999 musical version of &quot;Evangeline&quot; was performed in 2014 at the Conseil Acadien de Par-en-Bas theatre in Tusket, Nova Scotia. An actor travelled from Louisiana to perform the role of Gabriel.
* Historical flaws in the poem (and in the Voorhies work) are revealed, as there is no record of the surnames &quot;LaBiche&quot;, &quot;Bellefontaine&quot;, nor &quot;Lajeunesse&quot; in any of the censuses taken of the Acadians.
* Carrie Jenkins Harris&#x27;s final novel &quot;A modern Evangeline&quot; (1896) is a nod to the poem.

<doc id="476499" wikidata="Q5432731" url="?curid=476499" title="False protagonist">
<text>In fiction, a false protagonist is a literary technique, often used to make the plot more jarring or more memorable by fooling the audience&#x27;s preconceptions, that constructs a character who the audience assumes is the protagonist but is later revealed not to be.

A false protagonist is presented at the start of the fictional work as the main character, but then is eradicated, often by killing them (usually for shock value or as a plot twist) or changed in terms of their role in the story (i.e. making them a lesser character, a character who leaves the story, or revealing them to actually be the antagonist).

==Overview==
In film, a character can be made to seem like the main protagonist based on a number of techniques (beyond just simply focusing the plot on their role). Star power is a very effective method; audience members generally assume that the biggest &quot;name&quot; in a film will have a significant part to play. An abundance of close-ups can also be used as a subliminal method. Generally, the star of a film will get longer-lasting and more frequent close-ups than any other character, but this is rarely immediately apparent to viewers during the film. Alternatively, the false protagonist can serve as a narrator to the film, encouraging the audience to assume that the character survives to tell their tale later.

Many of the same techniques used in film can also apply to television, but the episodic nature adds an additional possibility. By ending one or more episodes with the false protagonist still in place, the show can reinforce the viewers&#x27; belief in the character&#x27;s protagonist status. Also, because TV shows often have changes of cast between seasons, some series can have unintentional false protagonists: characters who begin the series as the main character but then are replaced early in the show&#x27;s run by another character entirely. When the series is viewed as a whole, this can lead to the appearance of a false protagonist.

In video games, a false protagonist may initially be a playable character, only to be killed or revealed to be the antagonist. One key way in which video games employ the method that differs from uses in non-interactive fiction is by granting the player direct control over the false protagonist. Since most video games allow a player to control only the main characters (and their success or failure is based on playing skill, not pre-determined story), the sudden demise of the character that is being controlled serves to surprise the player.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*The &quot;Book of Samuel&quot; begins with Samuel&#x27;s birth and God&#x27;s call to him as a boy. At this point, readers are led to believe that Samuel is the central figure of the book. However, by the sixteenth chapter, the book begins to primarily focus on David.
* The story of Aladdin in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; begins with a wizard undertaking a difficult quest from Morocco to China to recover a powerful magical lamp. Gradually, it becomes clear that the boy Aladdin, whom the Wizard meets in China, is the true protagonist, while the Wizard is the story&#x27;s villain. 
* Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 science fiction short story &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; begins with an orator stirring up a rebellion among the workers of the story&#x27;s &quot;roadtowns&quot; (wide rapidly moving passenger platforms). The orator enumerates the workers&#x27; grievances, gaining their and the reader&#x27;s sympathy. However, the rebelling workers then callously cause mass death and injuries among commuters, and the true protagonist is revealed to be the director working effectively and courageously to put down the rebellion. By the end, the original orator is depicted as a cowardly and contemptible villain. 
*George R. R. Martin&#x27;s novel &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the first entry in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; epic fantasy series, features chapters told from the point of view of numerous characters, though the most prominent is Ned Stark. In the television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, he was portrayed by Sean Bean, who received top billing among the cast for Season One. Stark is generally assumed to be the series&#x27; main protagonist until the final chapters of the novel (corresponding to the penultimate episode of the first season) where he is unexpectedly executed.
*The light novel &quot;Goblin Slayer&quot; introduces a Warrior, Mage, and Monk who recruit a Priestess for a goblin killing quest. The three are eaten, poisoned to death, and humiliated to the point of ending up in a vegetative state. The Priestess is rescued by the legendary Goblin Slayer who replaces her escorts as the protagonist. The escorts were featured in promotional marketing material for the novel and its anime adaptation until the first episode was released.
*Juan Rulfo&#x27;s novel &quot;Pedro Paramo&quot; initially features Juan Preciado, who is searching for his father as a final wish made to his dying mother, as the main protagonist of the story. Halfway through the novel, Juan Preciado unexpectedly dies in the abandoned town of Comala. The latter half of the novel focuses exclusively on the life of Pedro Paramo, his rise to power, and how his ambition and ruthlessness leads to Comala&#x27;s demise.

===Comics===
*The webcomic &quot;Sleepless Domain&quot; introduces a team of five magical girl characters, initially presenting Tessa, the team leader, as the main protagonist. However, in the second chapter, three of Tessa&#x27;s teammates are killed in a battle with a powerful monster, and the fourth, Undine, is severely injured. Tessa sacrifices her powers to heal Undine, and the story shifts to focus on Undine as she struggles to cope with the loss of her friends. Tessa, now powerless, becomes a supporting character.
===Film===
* In Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Sicario&quot;, the story is told from the point of view of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who is enlisted for a government task force overseen by CIA officer Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) to take down the leader of a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Although most of the story is told from Kate&#x27;s perspective, she is constantly kept in the dark about the purpose of the task force as she comes to learn that she has is merely an observer who has no agency in the events unfolding around her. In the final act of the film it is revealed that this is Alejandro&#x27;s story and the perspective switches to follow him as he seeks revenge on the cartel leader who murdered his family. 
* Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot; opens with Marion Crane as the main character. However, she is killed partway through the film, making the murder far more unexpected and shocking. Hitchcock felt that the opening scenes with Marion as the false protagonist were so important to the film that when it was released in theaters, he compelled theater owners to enforce a &quot;no late admission&quot; policy.
* In the action film &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, the character played by Steven Seagal is introduced as a major protagonist only to be killed at the end of the first act, leaving the character played by Kurt Russell as the film&#x27;s true hero.
* Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode is the false protagonist of &quot;&quot; after the ending of &quot;Halloween H20&quot; was retconned to suggest Michael swapped places with a paramedic. Fans expressed displeasure and outrage at this event, as Strode is killed in the opening scene, but the events that follow are completely unrelated.
*In &quot;Mindhunters&quot;, J.D. (Christian Slater) was one of the central characters in the film&#x27;s opening, alongside Sara (Kathryn Morris). However, J.D (Slater) was killed half hour into the film, and was the first character to be killed off. Val Kilmer&#x27;s character Jack Harris was also ubiquitous at the beginning of the film, who was a leader. His character abruptly goes offscreen, until the other characters learn that he was killed.
*Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; had a series of notable actors who played false protagonists. They all either end up dying or being captured by the aliens. The actors who played false protagonists include Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan and Michael J. Fox. The characters who survived were played by actors who were less known at that time (Natalie Portman, for one).
*In &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;, nature photographer Jerry Manley (Mark L. Taylor) is initially portrayed as the protagonist. However, a few minutes into the film, he is bitten and killed by the venom of a poisonous spider, and the focus shifts to Dr. Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels).
*In the Coen brothers film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, Llewllyn Moss (Josh Brolin) appears to be the story&#x27;s central character until he is killed offscreen in the last half hour of the movie and the narrative switches focus to the sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones.
*In &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot;, a mild-mannered couple (played by Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich), who are the main protagonists, discover that there are psychopaths stalking and murdering tourists in the Hawaiian islands. The ending reveals that they are the actual killers.
*In the 2002 horror film &quot;The Ring&quot;, Samara (Daveigh Chase) is introduced as a tragic protagonist during flashbacks where viewers are meant to sympathize with her, only for the movie&#x27;s ending to reveal that she is a malevolent entity. 
* The 2020 film &quot;The Hunt&quot; introduces a string of false protagonists beginning with Emma Roberts, and continuing through Justin Hartley and Ike Barinholtz, before revealing Betty Gilpin&#x27;s character Crystal to be the true protagonist.
* In Wes Craven&#x27;s 1996 slasher film Scream, Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) is introduced as the main character in the opening scene of the film before she is violently killed by Ghostface, the film&#x27;s killer. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is then introduced as the film&#x27;s actual protagonist. Barrymore was originally attached to play the character of Sydney, but decided to play Casey, suggesting to the producers that her character be killed because &quot;You kind of always have this tension, but you kind of know that your hero is going to make it. And I thought &#x27;What if I die?&#x27;, and then it&#x27;ll be like all bets are off, anybody could get killed in this movie and would take away that cliché safety net of &#x27;the girl always gets away.&#x27;&quot;

<text>American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), also known as American storax, hazel pine, bilsted, redgum, satin-walnut, star-leaved gum, alligatorwood, gumball tree, or simply sweetgum, is a deciduous tree in the genus &quot;Liquidambar&quot; native to warm temperate areas of eastern North America and tropical montane regions of Mexico and Central America. Sweetgum is one of the main valuable forest trees in the southeastern United States, and is a popular ornamental tree in temperate climates. It is recognizable by the combination of its five-pointed star-shaped leaves (similar to maple leaves) and its hard, spiked fruits. It is currently classified in the plant family Altingiaceae, but was formerly considered a member of the Hamamelidaceae.

==Names==
This plant&#x27;s genus name &quot;Liquidambar&quot; was first given by Linnaeus in 1753 from the Latin (&#x27;fluid&#x27;) and the Arabic (&#x27;amber&#x27;), in allusion to the fragrant terebinthine juice or gum which exudes from the tree. Its specific epithet &quot;styraciflua&quot; is an old generic name meaning &#x27;flowing with storax&#x27; (a plant resin). The name &quot;storax&quot; has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of &quot;L. orientalis&quot; of Turkey, and to the resin better known as benzoin from various tropical trees in the genus &quot;Styrax&quot;.

The sweetgum has a Nahuatl name, &quot;Ocotzocuahuitl&quot;, which translates to &#x27;tree that gives pine resin&#x27; from &quot;ocotl&quot; (&#x27;pine&#x27;), &quot;tzotl&quot; (&#x27;resin&#x27;), &quot;cuahuitl&quot; (&#x27;tree&#x27;), which refers to the use of the tree&#x27;s resin.

The common name &quot;sweetgum&quot; refers to the species&#x27; &quot;sweetish gum&quot;, contrasting with the blackgum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), only distantly related, with which the sweetgum overlaps broadly in range. The species is also known as the &quot;redgum&quot;, for its reddish bark.

== History ==
The earliest known published record of &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; is in a work by Spanish naturalist Francisco Hernández published posthumously in 1615, in which he describes the species as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the genus name &quot;Liquidambar.&quot; In John Ray&#x27;s &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; (1686) it is called &quot;Styrax liquida&quot;. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the governor of Cuba, in the year 1517.
Juan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas &quot;who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour.&quot;
The species was introduced into Europe in 1681 by John Banister, the missionary collector sent out by Bishop Compton, who planted it in the palace gardens at Fulham in London, England.

===Fossil record===
An ancestor of &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; is known from Tertiary-aged fossils in Alaska, Greenland, and the mid-continental plateau of North America, much further north than &quot;Liquidambar&quot; now grows. A similar plant is also found in Miocene deposits of the Tertiary of Europe.

== Description ==
=== Size ===
&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; is a medium-sized to large tree, growing anywhere from in cultivation and up to in the wild, with a trunk up in diameter, on average. Trees may live to 400 years. The tree is a symmetrical shape and crowns into an egg shape when the branches get too heavy after its first two years of cultivation.

=== Bark and branches ===
Another distinctive feature of the tree is the peculiar appearance of its small branches and twigs. The bark attaches itself to these in plates edgewise instead of laterally, and a piece of the leafless branch with the aid of a little imagination readily takes on a reptilian form; indeed, the tree is sometimes called &quot;alligatorwood&quot;.
The bark is a light brown tinged with red and sometimes gray with dark streaks and has a density of . It is deeply fissured with scaly ridges. The branches carry layers of cork. The branchlets are pithy, many-angled, winged, and at first covered with rusty hairs, finally becoming red brown, gray or dark brown. As an ornamental tree, the species has a drawback—the branches may have ridges or &quot;wings&quot; that cause more surface area, increasing weight of snow and ice accumulation on the tree. However, the wood is heavy and hard with an interlocking grain, but is difficult to season.

=== Leaves ===
The leaves usually have five (but sometimes three or seven) sharply pointed palmate lobes. They are wide on average and have three distinct bundle scars.

They are long and broad, with a petiole. The rich dark green, smooth, shiny, star-shaped leaves generally turn brilliant yellow, orange, red, and purple colors in the autumn. This autumnal coloring has been characterized as not simply a flame, but a conflagration. Its reds and yellows compare to those of the maples (&quot;Acer&quot;), and in addition it has the dark purples and smoky browns of the ash (&quot;Fraxinus&quot;). However, in the northern part of its range, and where planted in yet colder areas, the leaves are often killed by frost while still green. On the other hand, in the extreme southern or tropical parts of its range, some trees are evergreen or semi-evergreen, with negligible fall color. The leaves are broad with glandular serrate teeth. The base is truncate or slightly heart-shaped. They come out of the bud plicate, downy, pale green, when full grown are bright green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath. They contain tannin and when bruised give a resinous fragrance.

While the starry five-pointed leaves of &quot;Liquidambar&quot; resemble those of some maples (&quot;Acer&quot;), &quot;Liquidambar&quot; is easily distinguished from &quot;Acer&quot; by its glossy, leathery leaves that are positioned singly (alternate), not in pairs (opposite) on the stems. Luna and promethea moth caterpillars feed on the leaves.

=== Flowers ===

The flowers typically appear in spring and persist into autumn/fall, sometimes persisting into winter. They are typically about in diameter and are covered with rusty hairs. The flowers are unisexual and greenish in color. Staminate flowers in terminal racemes long, the pistillate in a solitary head on a slender peduncle borne in the axil of an upper leaf. Staminate flowers destitute of calyx and corolla, but are surrounded by hairy bracts. Stamens indefinite; filaments short; anthers introrse. Pistillate flowers with a two-celled, two-beaked ovary, the carpels produced into a long, recurved, persistent style. The ovaries all more or less cohere and harden in fruit. There are many ovules but few mature.

=== Fruit ===
The distinctive compound fruit is hard, dry, and globose, in diameter, composed of numerous (40–60) capsules. Each capsule, containing one to two small seeds, has a pair of terminal spikes (for a total of 80–120 spikes). When the fruit opens and the seeds are released, each capsule is associated with a small hole (40–60 of these) in the compound fruit.

Fallen, opened fruits are often abundant beneath the trees; these have been popularly nicknamed &quot;burr (or bir) balls&quot;, &quot;gum balls&quot;, &quot;space bugs&quot;, &quot;sticker balls&quot;, &quot;spike balls&quot;, or &quot;monkey balls&quot;.

The fruit is a multicapsular spherical head and hangs on the branches during the winter. The woody capsules are mostly filled with abortive seeds resembling sawdust. The seeds are about thick, winged, and wind-dispersed. Goldfinches, purple finches, squirrels, and chipmunks eat the seeds of the tree. The seeds stratify within 30–90 days at or soaked in water for 15–20 days.
The long-stemmed fruit balls of &quot;Liquidambar&quot; resemble those of the American sycamore or buttonwood (&quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;), but are spiny and remain intact after their seeds are dispersed; the softer fruits of &quot;Platanus&quot; disintegrate upon seed dispersal. The long-persisting fallen spiked fruits can be unpleasant to walk on; sweet gum is banned in some places for this reason. In abundance, they can leave a lawn lumpy. The winter buds are yellow brown, long, acute. The inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming long, green tipped with red.

==Distribution==
Sweetgum is one of the most common hardwoods in the southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States, where it occurs naturally in lowlands from southwestern Connecticut south to central Florida, through central Ohio and west to Illinois, southern Missouri, and eastern Texas, but not colder highland areas of Appalachia or the Midwestern states. The species also occurs in Mexico from southern Nuevo León south to Chiapas, as well as in Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, Nicaragua and Honduras. In Mexico and Central America, it is a characteristic plant of cloud forests, growing at middle elevations in various mountainous areas where the climate is humid and more temperate.

The US government distribution maps for this species are incorrect concerning the southern limit of distribution in Florida. This species occurs abundantly at Highlands Hammock State Park in Sebring, Highlands County, Florida, and even southwest of Lake Okeechobee.

==Uses==

=== Wood ===

Sweetgum &quot;(Liquidambar styraciflua)&quot; is one of the most important commercial hardwoods in the Southeastern United States. Its wood is bright reddish brown (with the sapwood nearly white) and may have black grain in the heartwood; it is heavy, straight, satiny, and close-grained, but not strong. It takes a beautiful polish, but warps badly in drying. The wood has a specific gravity of 0.5910. It is too liable to decay for outdoor use.
In the carpentry industry, the timber is referred to as satin walnut and is one of the most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork. It was formerly used in the interior finish of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames. The wood is also used to make chopsticks for the East Asian market, as it has a naturally light color with appeal to certain segments of the Asian market.

=== Resin ===
The tree&#x27;s gum resin, for which the tree is named, exudes from the bark of the tree when wounded. It has many names, including liquid amber or copalm balsam. It is a kind of native balsam, or resin, resembling turpentine. It may be clear, reddish, or yellow, with a pleasant smell like ambergris. As the resin ages, it solidifies, the form in which it was historically exported in barrels. The resin is produced by stripping, boiling, and pressing the tree&#x27;s bark. The gum was used both medicinally and to make chewing gum.

=== Shikimic acid ===
&quot;L. styraciflua&quot; seeds may be a renewable source of shikimic acid.

=== Medicinal ===
Traditionally, sweet gum has been used in Chinese medicine to treat issues such as diarrhea, coughs, and skin sores.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; is a popular ornamental and forestal tree, cultivated for its distinctive foliage and intense autumn colors. It is commonly grown throughout its native North American range as well as many other temperate parts of the world, including moderately high elevations in the tropics. It is highly regarded in Bogota, Colombia. The species grows best in moist, acidic loam or clay soil, and tolerates poor drainage. It typically grows with other coastal plain species such as willow oak and sweetbay magnolia. Its salt tolerance is moderate. Chlorosis can develop on alkaline soil, especially where organic matter is low. Also, the American sweetgum tree does not grow well in shady areas. Grown as an ornamental tree in Australia, &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; has a distribution on mainland Australia from southwestern Western Australia, southern South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, and all the way up to the Atherton Tablelands in far North Queensland.

During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sweetgums were a popular landscaping and street tree. Three varieties, &quot;Palo Alto&quot;, &quot;Festival&quot;, and &quot;Burgundy&quot;, introduced in the late 1950s by the Saratoga Horticultural Foundation in Palo Alto, California became popular in the urban landscapes of California because of their pleasing appearance, striking fall colors, and ability to grow quickly and thrive; however, as the trees matured, the damage caused by surface roots and the increased production of seed balls led to the tree being considered a nuisance and a liability. Thousands of trees would be removed and repairs had to be conducted on nearby structures damaged by roots. The Western Arborist published a study that concluded that Sweetgums accounted for the greatest number of trees causing damage; in the city of Alameda alone it was found that 69% of Liquidambars planted in the city were either damaging or beginning to damage nearby structures. It is now recommended that the trees be planted at least 15 to 20 feet from structures and that they should not be used as street trees.

Among the many cultivars of &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; are (those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit): 
* &#x27;Burgundy&#x27; – dark red to purple fall colors may persist through winter
* &#x27;Clydesform&#x27; – columnar or narrowly pyramidal; slow growth to 9 meters; yellow-orange fall colors; also sold as &#x27;Emerald Sentinel&#x27;

* &#x27;Slender Silhouette&#x27; – very narrow columnar form
* &#x27;Worplesdon&#x27; () – cutleaf cultivar with orange, red and purple fall colors
The organizers of the September 11th Memorial in New York donated a grove of sweetgum trees to the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

=== Infection on &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; ===
The imperfect fungus &quot;Dicarpella dryina&quot; is a leaf parasite reported to occur on a wide range of host plants, including species of sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; ). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5 mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on sweetgum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of &quot;D. dryina&quot; were investigated on leaves of sweetgum using a combination of microscopic techniques. &quot;D. dryina&quot; infection on sweetgum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that &quot;D. dryina&quot; can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., sweetgum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus.

Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of &quot;D. dryina&quot;. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweetgum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweetgum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by &quot;D. dryina&quot;.

<text>Narrow Street is a narrow road running parallel to the River Thames through the Limehouse area of east London, England. It used to be much narrower, and is the oldest part of Limehouse, with many buildings originating from the eighteenth century.
== History ==
Most archaeologists believe that Narrow Street represents the line of the medieval river wall. The wall was built to reclaim riverside marshland and to protect it from the tides. Houses were built, on the wall itself at first, but then outwards onto the foreshore by a process of encroachment. The eastern end of Narrow Street was previously known as Fore Street.
A combination of tides and currents made this point on the Thames a natural landfall for ships, the first wharf being completed in 1348. Lime kilns or oasts (&quot;lymehostes&quot;) used in the production of mortar and pottery were built here in the fourteenth century.

The area grew rapidly in Elizabethan times as a centre for world trade and by the reign of James I nearly half of the area&#x27;s 2,000 population were mariners. The area supplied ships with ropes and other necessities; pottery was also made here for the ships. Ship chandlers settled here building wooden houses and wharves in the cramped space between street and river. Narrow Street may take its name from the closeness of the original buildings. An 1865 report to Parliament noted that no part of Narrow Street was wider than 25 feet.

The Limehouse Cut for barges, which ran under Narrow Street and led to the Lee Navigation, was established in 1766. Limehouse Basin was built in 1820, to transship goods to barges on the Regent&#x27;s Canal.

In 1661, Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary of a visit to a porcelain factory in Narrow Street alighting via Duke Shore Stairs while en route to view work on boats being built for herring fishing. The Limehouse area fitted out, repaired and resupplied ships. In 1772, Smith &amp; Sykes ran a sugar house, a small factory that baked and refined sugar.

Limehouse Cut was redirected into Limehouse Basin, which was one of the first docks to close in the late 1960s. Nicholas Hawksmoors&#x27; Church St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse was designated a conservation area by the London Docklands Development Corporation in the 1980s.

For much of the 20th century the area was dominated by the tall chimney of Stepney Power Station at Blyth Wharf, which has since been demolished.

Access to the area was always difficult, with the dock standing to the north, and the entrance to the Rotherhithe Tunnel at one end. In 1993 the Limehouse Link tunnel was completed, further restricting traffic to the riverside area. The Narrow Street swing bridge is sited between Limehouse Basin and the Thames.

In 1977 the north side of the street was demolished. Until then it was half its present width.

== Chinatown ==
In the eighteenth century a small group of Chinese sailors from Canton and Southern China settled along the old Limehouse Causeway creating the original London Chinatown. The Chinese community later moved to Soho following the Blitz.

== Historic buildings ==

On the south side of Narrow Street is a rare example of an early Georgian brick terrace. With the exception of the westernmost property (The Grapes public house) it was standing derelict and abandoned, but in 1964 the writer Andrew Sinclair bought and saved one of the houses and persuaded his Cambridge friends to buy the others. (Early Georgian houses can be distinguished from late ones in the way that the windows are not set back from the brick frontage.) The Grapes (formerly The Bunch of Grapes, and known to the young Charles Dickens) was notably bought in 2011 by actor Sir Ian McKellen, director Sean Mathias and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; owner Evgeny Lebedev.

== Redevelopment ==
The late twentieth century brought much development to the area, with the erection of the Canary Wharf tower close by. Since the 1990s, many new apartment complexes have been built around the Limehouse Basin as well as Victorian warehouse conversions, with Limehouse now being one of the most sought after property sites in London. Its close proximity to the River Thames has made property prices around Limehouse and the Docklands soar over the last decade. However, a 2001 Census listed 5.4 per cent of homes in Poplar and Limehouse as being without central heating and/or private bathroom.

The street is home to a number of pubs and restaurants, including &quot;The Narrow&quot;, a gastropub run by Gordon Ramsay. Booty&#x27;s Riverside Bar, which closed in 2013, was an independently owned pub dating to the 16th century. In the 18th century Booty&#x27;s was an engineering shop for the barge builders, Sparkes. In the 19th century it was re-fronted, and by the 1870s it was a licensed bar called The Waterman&#x27;s Arms owned by Taylor Walker. It was absorbed by Woodward Fisher, a lighterage firm run by Anne Fisher, popularly known as &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot;. She was a real-life London version of the protagonist in the film of that name. One of the great East End characters, she commanded a fleet of 200 barges.

==Residents==

Famous residents include or have included the inventor Richard Trevithick, the poet Ernest Dowson, actors Sir Ian McKellen, Steven Berkoff and Cleo Rocos, the politician Lord Owen, and the authors Matthew Parris and Andrew Sinclair. The writer, photographer and television presenter Daniel Farson lived at number 92 for several years. It was also the home of the film director Sir David Lean.

== Art and literature ==
Its picturesque buildings and atmospheric location abutting onto the River Thames attracted artists and writers.
*Charles Dickens&#x27; godfather Christopher Huffam ran his sail-making business from Newell Street, Limehouse.
*James McNeill Whistler and Charles Napier Hemy sketched and painted at locations on Narrow Street&#x27;s river waterfront.

==Transport==
Cycle Superhighway 3 CS3 between Tower Gateway to Barking and is one of London&#x27;s first Cycle Superhighways. Some residents raised a petition calling for CS3 to be moved from Narrow Street onto the A13 Commercial Road, arguing that the street was too narrow and that incidents of abuse and aggression had risen sharply since the route was introduced. Transport for London (TfL) said they had no plans to move it. Mayor Boris Johnson defended the choice as a road that was already popular with cyclists to and from the City. The London Cycling Campaign supported the route but called for improvements. In 2011, TfL agreed to remove logos from the road surface, but not to change the route.

The National Trail Thames Path for walkers runs along Narrow Street and it is also included in the London Marathon course.

Docklands Light Railway stations are &quot;Limehouse&quot; (for National Rail as well) and &quot;Westferry&quot;.

The London River Services pier is Canary Wharf Pier.

<text>The Nepalese rupee (, Roman: &quot;Rupaiyām̐&quot;; symbol: रु.; code: NPR) is the official currency of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. The Nepalese rupee is subdivided into 100 &quot;paisa&quot;. The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal. The Nepalese rupee was introduced in 1932 when it replaced the Nepalese mohar at the rate 2:1.

The Nepalese rupee (रु.) has been pegged to the Indian rupee (₹) at the rate रु.1.60 = ₹1 since 1994; prior to this, it had been pegged at the rate रु.1.45 = ₹1.

==History==
The rupee was introduced in 1932, replacing the silver mohar at a rate of 2 mohar = 1 rupee. At first, the rupee was called the &quot;Mohru&quot; in Nepali.

=== The &quot;Bullet paisa&quot; ===
In 1955, 4 Paisa coins were minted, made from rifle cartridge cases from World War II that were used by the Gurkha soldiers who fought against the Imperial Japanese in the Pacific. The coins were produced by removing the primer from the cases and the cases were then converted into the 4 Paisa coins to commemorate the Gurkha&#x27;s courage and victory during the war.

Due to the small number of cases found, these coins were minted for one year only.

They are known as the &quot;Nepal Bullet Paisa&quot;.

===1972–2007===
During King Birendra’s rule, one can also distinguish between two major series of banknotes. The first series features the king wearing the military uniform while on the notes of the second series the king is wearing the traditional Nepalese crown adorned with feathers of the bird of paradise. During this period regular banknotes of 2 and 20 rupees and special banknotes of 25 and 250 rupees were issued for the first time. The legends found on the last issues of Gyanendra revert to Nepal &quot;sarkar&quot; (&quot;Nepalese government&quot;), thus omitting the reference to the king.

===2007–Present===


In October 2007, a 500-&quot;rupee&quot; note was issued on which the king&#x27;s portrait was replaced by Mount Everest. This reflects the historic change from a monarchy to a republic which took place in May 2008 in Nepal. Further notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000 rupees with Mount Everest and without reference to the king in their legends followed in 2008. The first issues of the 500- and 1000-rupee notes were printed on paper which still had the king&#x27;s crowned portrait as a watermark in the &quot;window&quot; on the right part of the face of the notes. It was decided to print a red Rhododendron flower (Nepal&#x27;s national flower) on top of the watermark. Notes of these denominations which were issued in 2009 and thereafter are printed on paper which has a Rhododendron flower as watermark instead of the royal portrait and were therefore released without the additional overprint in red.

==Banknotes==
On 17 September 1945, the government introduced banknotes for 5, 10 and 100 rupees, with the name mohru used in Nepalese. There are also 250-rupee notes commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Birendra Bir Bikram Shah in 1997. Since 2007, Nepalese rupee banknotes have been produced by Perum Peruri, the mint company of Indonesia.

In 2012, Nepal Rastra Bank issued a revised banknote series that is similar to the 2007 series, but now include inscriptions in English and the year of issue on the back.

==Exchange rates==
Between 1857 and 1930, the Nepalese rupee (two half-rupees or mohars) was fixed at 1.28 per Indian rupee. After this period, its value fluctuated against the Indian rupee, falling to रु1.60 = ₹1 in 1939, rising to रु0.60 = ₹1 during the Second World War and falling again afterwards. In 1952, the government of Nepal officially pegged the Nepalese rupee at रु1.28 = ₹1, although the market rate remained at रु1.60 = ₹1.

Between 1955 and 1957, there was a series of soft peg revaluations that started at रु1.755 = ₹1 and appreciated to रु1.305 = ₹1 by 1957. In 1958, the government applied a new exchange rate of रु1.505 = ₹1 for the purchase of plane tickets only. A hard peg of रु1.60 = ₹1 was instituted in 1960, which was revalued to रु1.0155 = ₹1 when the Indian rupee was sharply devalued on 6 June 1966. The Indian rupee ceased to be legal tender in Nepal in 1966.

From 1967 to 1975, the government pegged the Nepalese rupee against the Indian rupee, the US dollar and gold, starting at रु1.35 = ₹1, रु10.125 = US$1 and रु1 = 0.08777g gold. By the time the gold peg was removed in 1978, the exchange rate was रु1.39075 = ₹1, रु12.50 = $1 and रु1 = 0.0808408g gold.

In 1983, the Nepali rupee&#x27;s anchor was changed to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, which in practice amounted to a hard peg against the Indian rupee. This remained until 1993, when the peg was officially set at रु1.60 = ₹1.

<text>Rodolphe Töpffer ( ; ; 31 January 1799 – 8 June 1846) was a Swiss teacher, author, painter, cartoonist, and caricaturist. He is best known for his illustrated books (&quot;littérature en estampes&quot;, &quot;graphic literature&quot;), which are possibly the earliest European comics. He is known as the father of comic strips and has been credited as the &quot;first comics artist in history.&quot;

Paris-educated, Töpffer worked as a schoolteacher at a boarding school, where he entertained students with his caricatures. In 1837, he published (published in the United States in 1842 as &quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot;). Each page of the book had one to six captioned cartoon panels, much like modern comics. Töpffer published several more of these books, and wrote theoretical essays on the form.

== Biography ==

Töpffer was born on 12 pluviôse of the seventh year of the French Republican calendar at ten hours after noon (« dix heures après midi »), that is on 31 January 1799, in Geneva, Léman, France. His father Wolfgang-Adam Töpffer was a painter and occasional caricaturist. His grandfather, Georg-Christoph, a master tailor, had come from Franconia and held a sock factory in Geneva. Töpffer was educated in Paris from 1819 to 1820, then returned to Geneva and became a school teacher. By 1823, he established his own boarding school for boys. In 1832, he was appointed Professor of Literature at the University of Geneva.

Relatively successful in his profession, Töpffer gained fame from activities he pursued in his spare time. He painted local landscapes in a style considered influenced by contemporary Romanticism. He wrote short stories and entertained his students by drawing caricatures. He collected these caricatures in books; the first of them, (&quot;The Story of Mr. Wooden Head&quot;), was completed by 1827 but not published until 1837. It was 30 pages, each containing one to six captioned panels. It was translated and republished in the United States in 1842 as &quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot;. The stories were reproduced by &quot;autography&quot;, a variation of lithography that allowed him to draw on specially prepared paper with a pen. The process allowed for a loose line, and was quicker and freer than the more common engraving process.

== Publications ==

The comedic story was not originally intended for publication, but Töpffer continued to create others in his spare time to entertain his acquaintances. Notable among them was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who in 1831 persuaded Töpffer to publish his stories. Seven of them were eventually published in newspaper form across Europe, but Goethe would not live to see them.

*&quot;Histoire de Mr. Jabot&quot; – created 1831, first published 1833. It features the adventures of a middle class dandy who attempts to enter the contemporary upper class.
*&quot;Monsieur Crépin&quot; – first published in 1837. It features the adventures of a father who employs a series of tutors for his children and falls prey to their eccentricities.
*&quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot; – created 1827, first published 1837. The above-mentioned story.
*&quot;Monsieur Pencil&quot; – created 1831, first published 1840. An escalating series of events beginning with an artist losing his sketch to the blowing wind and almost resulting in a global war.
*&quot;Histoire d&#x27;Albert&quot; – first published in 1845. The adventures of an inexperienced young man in search of a career. After many attempts he ends up as a journalist in support of radical ideas. The panels show the erection of barricades and crowds singing La Marseillaise.
*&quot;Histoire de Monsieur Cryptogame&quot; – first published in 1845. The story of a lepidopterist who goes to great lengths to replace his current lover with a more suitable one.
*&quot;Le Docteur Festus&quot; (or &quot;Voyages et aventures du Docteur Festus&quot;) – created 1831, first published 1846. A scientist wanders the world, offering his assistance. He is blissfully unaware that disaster marks his path.

All seven are considered satirical views of 19th century society and proved popular at the time. In 1842, Töpffer published &quot;Essais d&#x27;autographie&quot;.

On 14 September 1842, the &quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot; was first introduced to a United States audience as &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck&quot;. It was published in comic book form as a supplement to that day&#x27;s edition of &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, a New York City newspaper edited by author John Neal. It has come to be considered the first American comic book and, according to several Robert Beerbohm articles published in &quot;Comic Art&quot; and the &quot;Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot;, the inspiration for an entire U.S. genre of nineteenth-century graphic novel.

The University Press of Mississippi published an English translation of his full-length stories as well as previously unpublished works in 2007.

Töpffer is considered alternatively the father or at least an important precursor to the modern art form of comics. He is also considered to be an influence on younger comics artists such as Wilhelm Busch, creator of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;.

==Child art==
Töpffer wrote two chapters on child art and child creativity in his book (1848), which was published after his death. He wrote that children often displayed greater creativity than trained artists, whose creativity was often overshadowed by their technical skill.

<text>David Edwards (born 1962) is a British media campaigner who is co-editor of the Media Lens website with David Cromwell. Edwards specialises in the analysis of mainstream, or corporate, mass media, which are normally considered impartial or liberal, an interpretation both men believe is disputable.

Born in Maidstone, Kent, Edwards was raised in the village of Bearsted, and spent summers in Sweden, his mother&#x27;s country of origin. He sees this as influencing his attitudes to modern living. After graduating from Leicester University with a Politics degree he worked in sales and marketing management for several large corporations, but became profoundly dissatisfied with the corporate working environment. According to Edwards, while working at British Telecom in the late 1980s, his employment there became untenable after he attempted to set up a &quot;green initiatives&quot; project. In 1991, feeling he was &quot;not fully alive&quot;, he left the business world completely to begin his writing career, taking the advice of Joseph Campbell, the American mythologist, to &quot;follow your bliss&quot;, Edwards earned most of his income at this time by teaching English as a foreign language.

After his early articles were published on human rights and environmental issues by independent magazines and journals (such as &quot;Z Magazine&quot;), Edwards wrote his first book, &quot;Free to be Human&quot;, (Green Books, 1995), which later appeared in the United States as &quot;Burning All Illusions: a Guide to Personal and Political Freedom&quot; (South End Press, 1996). It relies on Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky&#x27;s propaganda model, as well as on the writings of Erich Fromm. Edwards advanced the thesis that corporate structural factors conspire to make the mass media give a picture of the world that goes beyond the political indoctrination postulated by Herman and Chomsky, to encompass almost all aspects of personal life, by constantly promoting the values of blind consumerism.

Edwards has also drawn on his practice of Buddhism in his writings. Edwards, writing for the New York-based &quot;&quot; in 2005, commented: &quot;The antidotes to systemic greed, I am convinced, are political movements motivated by unconditional compassion for suffering. This compassion needs to be rooted in genuinely profound and authentic sources—the kind provided today by the best Buddhist teachers and organisations.&quot;

Edwards was remote working in Bournemouth for the International Society for Ecology and Culture at the time he first met David Cromwell. Together with Cromwell, Edwards co-founded in 2001 (and remains a co-editor of) Media Lens, a website correcting what they perceive as bias in the British &quot;corporate media&quot;. The Media Lens&#x27; editors have collaborated on two books, &quot;Guardians of Power: The Myth of the Liberal Media&quot; (2006) and &quot;Newspeak in the 21st Century&quot; (2009).

<text>Nyssaceae is a family of flowering trees sometimes included in the dogwood family (Cornaceae). Nyssaceae is composed of 37 known species in the following five genera:

*&quot;Camptotheca&quot;, the happy trees: two species in China
*&quot;Davidia&quot;, the dove tree, handkerchief tree, or ghost tree: one species in central China
*&quot;Diplopanax&quot;: two species in southern China and Vietnam
*&quot;Mastixia&quot;: about nineteen species in Southeast Asia
*&quot;Nyssa&quot;, the tupelos: about 7–10 species in eastern North America and East to Southeast Asia
Among the extinct genera of the family are &quot;Mastixicarpum&quot;, very similar to &quot;Diplopanax&quot;, and &quot;Tsukada&quot;, an extinct relative of &quot;Davidia&quot;.

In some treatments, &quot;Davidia&quot; is split into its own family, the Davidiaceae. &quot;Diplopanax&quot; and &quot;Mastixia&quot; are also sometimes separated into the family Mastixiaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group APG III system included the genera of Nyssaceae within Cornaceae. The APG IV system recognizes Nyssaceae as a distinct family

<doc id="476536" wikidata="Q442570" url="?curid=476536" title="Silbannacus">
<text>Silbannacus was an obscure Roman emperor or usurper during the Crisis of the Third Century. Silbannacus is not mentioned in any contemporary documents and his existence was forgotten until the 20th century, when two coins bearing his name were discovered, the first in the 1930s and the second in the 1980s. His unusual name suggests that he might have been of Gallic descent.

As the only known evidence for his existence is the two coins, the exact time and extent of Silbannacus&#x27;s rule is not known. Based on the design of the coin and its silver content, Silbannacus was most likely concurrent with the reigns of Philip the Arab (244–249), Decius (249–251), Trebonianus Gallus (251–253), Aemilian (253), or Valerian (253–260). The two most prevalent ideas are the older hypothesis, that Silbannacus was a usurper in Gaul during the reign of Philip the Arab, at some point between 248 and 250, and the newer hypothesis, based on the design of the second coin, that Silbannacus was a briefly reigning legitimate emperor, holding Rome between the death of Aemilian and the arrival of Valerian.

== Name ==
The coins of Silbannacus give him the style &quot;Imperator Mar. Silbannacus Augustus&quot;. Per the German historian Felix Hartmann, writing in 1982, and the English historian Maxwell Craven, writing in 2019, the unusual name Silbannacus appears to be of Celtic origin, due to the suffix &quot;-acus&quot;, suggesting that Silbannacus might have been of Gallic, or perhaps even British, descent. Another possibility is that Silbannacus is a misspelling of Silvannacus or Silvaniacus, names derived from the Roman forest god Silvanus. Silvanus might have been based on the Etruscan god Selvans, which could suggest Silbannacus as originating from central Italy (the homeland of the Etruscans). Otherwise, northern Italy had Celto-Gallic influences, an alternate explanation of the suffix &quot;-acus&quot;, which suggest a northern Italian origin. The name being misspelled is possible, as there exist known examples of misspellings on coins of other emperors: some of the coins of Licinius (308–324) refer to him as &quot;Licinnius&quot; and some of the coins of Vetranio (350) refer to him as &quot;Vertanio&quot;.

As there were several common Roman names that began with Mar., the correct reading of his &quot;nomen&quot; is not certain. Though some modern reference works refer to him as &quot;Marcus Silbannacus&quot;, Marcus was typically a &quot;praenomen&quot;, unlikely to be featured on coins in this period. More likely readings, according to Craven &quot;the only likely alternatives&quot;, are either Marcius or Marius. Additionally, the German historian Christian Körner suggested the name Marinus as a third possibility in 2002. If his &quot;nomen&quot; was Marcius, Craven considers it possible that he could have been related to Marcia Otacilia Severa, the wife and empress of Emperor Philip the Arab (244–249).

== Interpretations and speculation ==
Both coins of Silbannacus were found in what was once Gaul; the first coin was discovered in the 1930s, reputedly in Lorraine and the second coin was found in the 1980s somewhere near Paris. The Lorraine coin was acquired by the British Museum in 1937 from a Swiss coin dealer. The unique coin baffled the researchers and raised many questions. Romans minted coins in large numbers, meaning that there only being a single known example made its authenticity, and the existence of Silbannacus, uncertain. The British Museum did not doubt the coin as being genuine, as it resembled other coins of the third century in design and composition, but there were questions as to whether Silbannacus was a real figure. Further evidence taken to confidently establish the coin as genuine was the fact that the portrait of Silbannacus did not completely match that of any other emperor, that there was no evidence of retouching on the letters, and that the image on the reverse of the coin was otherwise more or less unknown. The design and the silver content of the coin confidently places it in the middle of the third century, minted at some point between AD 238 and 260. This makes Silbannacus an emperor or usurper during the turbulent Crisis of the Third Century when the Roman Empire was plagued by both internal instability and external threats.

The second coin was held in a private collection for many years after its discovery and its existence was not widely known until it was published by the French historian Sylviane Estiot in 1996. It was only with Estiot&#x27;s paper that Silbannacus became widely accepted as a real historical figure, his existence now supported by two coins, rather than a single one. Though the coins share the same inscription on the obverse side, they differ on the reverse side. The first coin contains the inscription VICTORIA AVG. and the second coin contains MARTI PROPVGT (&quot;To Mars the defender&quot;). As the only evidence for his existence is two coins, the reign or usurpation of Silbannacus might have been very brief, perhaps lasting just a few weeks, or perhaps just a few days. Considering the period and his obscurity, it is likely that his reign, or usurpation, ended in Silbannacus&#x27; death.

Based on the depiction on his coins, Silbannacus was relatively young, had a small head and slightly elongated face, with a slightly aquiline nose. In contrast to the many fully-bearded contemporary emperors, Silbannacus apparently did not have a full beard, but whiskers descending alongside the jawbone, and a beardless chin.

=== As usurper in Gaul ===

It is not clear from the coins alone when Silbannacus would have been active. In 1940, the British numismatist Harold Mattingly dated the 1937 coin, based on its style, to 249/250. Most later authors have agreed with this approximate mid-3rd century date, and he is most often placed as a usurper in the turbulent reign of Philip the Arab. Craven suggests 248 as the most likely year, placing a revolt by Silbannacus shortly prior to the uprisings of the subsequent usurpers Sponsian, Pacatian and Jotapian. Though it is the most common suggestion, the coin being from the time of Philip is an educated guess, and far from certain. Some historians place Silbannacus in the reign of Philip&#x27;s successor Decius (249–251) instead, and others place him as directly preceding Postumus (260–269), who founded the breakaway Gallic Empire, an idea first proposed by the French historian J. M. Doyen in 1989.

In addition to the location of discovery of the coins, another point that might also connect Silbannacus to Gaul is the reverse side of the 1937 coin depicting Mercury holding a Victoria; Mercury being a pre-eminent god in Gaul who would later be used on the coins of Postumus. The inclusion of Mercury is one of the features that makes dating the coin precisely difficult, the deity only being found infrequently on coins before the late third century.

In a 1982 study on usurpers in the third century, Hartmann offered a speculative reconstruction of a revolt by Silbannacus, writing that he might have revolted against Philip in Germania Superior, near the Rhine frontier. Hartmann speculates that Silbannacus might have commanded Germanic auxiliaries in the Roman army. The speculative revolt may have lasted until the beginning of Decius, who is mentioned by the 4th-century historian Eutropius as suppressing an uprising in Gaul. It is possible that Eutropius actually refers to an uprising in Galatia (in Anatolia), and that reading it as &quot;Gaul&quot; is an error.

In 2019, Craven offered a speculative reconstruction similar to that of Hartmann, writing that Silbannacus might have begun as governor of either Germania Superior or Germania Inferior, elevated by his troops to emperor after dealing with some forgotten crisis on the Rhine frontier. As the 1937 coin depicts Victoria, and the 1996 coin depicts Mars, deities associated with success in battle, Craven speculated that Silbannacus might have inflicted some surprise defeat on a Germanic invasion. These reconstructions are highly speculative: there are no known records of Germanic tribes threatening the Rhine frontier during the reign of Philip, and the ideas that Silbannacus was a commander or governor are as of yet baseless.

=== As emperor in Rome ===

The style of the second coin of Silbannacus appears to copy the design used on the coins of the emperor Aemilian (253), which suggests that Silbannacus ruled later than the time of Philip, possibly around the time of Aemilian&#x27;s short reign. In particular, both the bust of Silbannacus on the coin, as well as the legend MARTI PROPVGT appears very similar to Aemilian&#x27;s coins. The similarity might suggest that the coins were made in the same mint, which would mean that Silbannacus held brief control of the mint in the imperial capital.

253 was a turbulent year and many of the events that took place are obscure due to a lack of surviving sources. Aemilian&#x27;s predecessor was Trebonianus Gallus (251–253) and Aemilian had been proclaimed emperor by his troops after winning a victory against the Goths by the Danube. Gallus ordered the general Valerian to defeat the usurper, but Aemilian quickly reached Italy and overthrew Gallus. Aemilian&#x27;s reign would be cut short when Valerian rebelled against him within weeks. Aemilian departed Rome to battle Valerian but was assassinated by his soldiers before a battle could take place. As features of the second coin are similar to features of coins minted at Rome, it is possible that Silbannacus was not an usurper in Gaul, but a briefly reigning ruler of the Roman capital.

Per the British historian Kevin Butcher, one possibility is that Silbannacus was an officer of Aemilian, who in the aftermath of Aemilian&#x27;s death secured Rome and tried to rally against Valerian. If this is true, Silbannacus would have been unsuccessful, as Valerian took control of Rome shortly after Aemilian&#x27;s death. That the coins of Silbannacus have both been found in Gaul does not discredit the idea that he ruled in Rome: currency moved around in the empire and there exists a traceable line of movement of coins from the capital to the Rhine frontier. Before the suggestion that the first coin was minted in Gaul was made, Mattingly had initially written that it was similar to the coins produced for Philip the Arab at Rome. If he ruled the capital, which would require support from the Roman Senate, Silbannacus may be counted as a legitimate, albeit ephemeral, emperor, rather than a failed usurper. Silbannacus as a ruler in Rome is supported as the most likely option by some historians, such as Estiot, who published the second coin, and the German historian Udo Hartmann.

<text>The flight deck of an aircraft carrier is the surface from which its aircraft take off and land, essentially a miniature airfield at sea. On smaller naval ships which do not have aviation as a primary mission, the landing area for helicopters and other VTOL aircraft is also referred to as the flight deck. The official U.S. Navy term for these vessels is &quot;air-capable ships&quot;.

Flight decks have been in use upon ships since 1910, the American pilot Eugene Ely being the first individual to take off from a warship. Initially consisting of wooden ramps built over the forecastle of capital ships, a number of battlecruisers, including the British and , the American and , and the Japanese &quot;Akagi&quot; and battleship &quot;Kaga&quot;, were converted to aircraft carriers during the interwar period. The first aircraft carrier to feature a full-length flight deck, akin to the configuration of the modern vessels, was the converted liner which entered service in 1918. The armoured flight deck was another innovation pioneered by the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Early landing arrangements relied on the low speed and landing speed of the era&#x27;s aircraft, being simply &quot;caught&quot; by a team of deck-hands in a fairly hazardous arrangement, but these became impractical as heavier aircraft with higher landing speeds emerged; thus an arrangement of arrestor cables and tailhooks soon became the favoured approach.

During the Cold War era, numerous innovations were introduced to the flight deck. The angled flight deck, invented by Dennis Cambell of the Royal Navy, was one prominent design feature that drastically simplified aircraft recovery and deck movements, enabling landing and launching operations to be performed simultaneously rather than interchangeably; it also better handled the higher landing speeds of jet-powered aircraft. In 1952, became the first aircraft carrier to trial the angled flight deck. Another advance was the ski-jump, which fitted an angled ramp on the flight deck near the end of the aircraft&#x27;s takeoff run; the change greatly reduced the distance required and became particularly useful for operating STOVL aircraft. Furthermore, various unsuccessful concepts to replace or complement the conventional flight deck have emerged over the years, from the flexible flight deck to the submarine aircraft carrier and flying boat fighter aircraft.

==Evolution==
===Early===
The first flight decks were inclined wooden ramps built over the forecastle of warships. Eugene Ely made the first fixed-wing aircraft take-off from a warship from on 14 November 1910.

Two months later, on 18 January 1911, Ely landed his Curtiss pusher plane on a platform on anchored in San Francisco Bay using the first tailhook system, designed and built by circus performer and aviator Hugh Robinson. Ely told a reporter: &quot;It was easy enough. I think the trick could be successfully turned nine times out of ten.&quot; On 9 May 1912, Commander Charles Samson became the first man to take off from a ship which was underway when he flew his Short S.27 off , which was steaming at .

Because the take-off speed of early aircraft was so low, it was possible for an aircraft to make a very short take off when the launching ship was steaming into the wind. Later, removable &quot;flying-off platforms&quot; appeared on the gun turrets of battleships and battlecruisers starting with , allowing aircraft to be flown off for scouting purposes, although there was no chance of recovery.

On 2 August 1917, while performing trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Harris Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup successfully on board the flying-off platform of , becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. However, on his third attempt, a tire burst as he attempted to land, causing the aircraft to go over the side, killing him; thus Dunning also has the dubious distinction of being the first person to die in an aircraft carrier landing accident.

The landing arrangements on &quot;Furious&quot; were highly unsatisfactory. In order to land, aircraft had to maneuver around the superstructure. &quot;Furious&quot; was therefore returned to dockyard hands to have a deck added aft for landing, on top of a new hangar. The central superstructure remained, however, and turbulence caused by it badly affected the landing deck.

===Full length===
The first aircraft carrier that began to show the configuration of the modern vessel was the converted liner , which had a large flat wooden deck added over the entire length of the hull, giving a combined landing and take-off deck unobstructed by superstructure turbulence. Because of her unobstructed flight deck, &quot;Argus&quot; had no fixed conning tower and no funnel. Rather, exhaust gases were trunked down the side of the ship and ejected under the fantail of the flight deck (which, despite arrangements to disperse the gases, gave an unwelcome &quot;lift&quot; to aircraft immediately prior to landing). 

The lack of a command position and funnel was unsatisfactory, and &quot;Argus&quot; was used to experiment with various ideas to remedy the solution. A photograph in 1917 shows her with a canvas mock-up of a starboard &quot;island&quot; superstructure and funnel. This was placed on the starboard side because the rotary engines of some early aircraft created torque which pulled the nose left, meaning an aircraft naturally yawed to port on take-off; therefore, it was desirable that they turned away from the fixed superstructure. This became the typical aircraft carrier arrangement and was used in the next British carriers, and .

After World War I, battlecruisers that otherwise would have been discarded under the Washington Naval Treaty—such as the British and , the American and , and the Japanese &quot;Akagi&quot; and battleship &quot;Kaga&quot;—were converted to carriers along the above lines. Being large and fast they were perfectly suited to this role; the heavy armoring and scantlings and low speed of the converted battleship &quot;Eagle&quot; served to be something of a handicap in practice. 

Because the military effectiveness of aircraft carriers was then unknown, early ships were typically equipped with cruiser-calibre guns to aid in their defense if surprised by enemy warships. These guns were generally removed in World War II and replaced with anti-aircraft guns, as carrier doctrine developed the &quot;task force&quot; (later called &quot;battle group&quot;) model, where the carrier&#x27;s defense against surface ships would be a combination of escorting warships and its own aircraft.

In ships of this configuration, the hangar deck was the strength deck and an integral part of the hull, and the hangar and light steel flight deck were considered to be part of the superstructure. Such ships were still being built into the late 1940s, classic examples being the U.S. Navy&#x27;s and carriers. However, in 1936, the Royal Navy began construction of the . 

In these ships, the flight deck was the strength deck, an integral part of the hull, and was heavily armored to protect the ship and her air complement. The flight deck as the strength deck was adopted for later construction. This was necessitated by the ever-increasing size of the ships, from the 13,000 ton in 1922 to over 100,000 tons in the latest and carriers.

===Armored===
When aircraft carriers supplanted battleships as the primary fleet capital ship, there were two schools of thought on the question of armor protection being included into the flight deck. The United States Navy (USN) initially favored unarmored flight decks because they maximized aircraft carrier hangar and flight deck size, which in turn maximized aircraft capacity in the hangar, and on the flight deck, in the form of a permanent &quot;deck park&quot; for a large proportion of the aircraft carried. 

In 1936 the Royal Navy developed the armored flight deck aircraft carrier which also enclosed the hangar sides and ends with armor. The addition of armor to the flight deck offered aircraft below some protection against aerial bombs while the armored hangar sides and ends helped to minimize damage and casualties from explosions or fires within or outside the hangar. The addition of armor to the hangar forced a reduction in top-weight, so the hangar height was reduced, and this restricted the types of aircraft that these ships could carry, although the Royal Navy&#x27;s armored carriers did carry spare aircraft in the hangar overheads. 

The armor also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armored flight deck aircraft carrier. Additionally, Royal Navy aircraft carriers did not use a permanent deck park until approximately 1943; before then the aircraft capacity of RN aircraft carriers was limited to their hangar capacity. 

The 23,000-ton British had a hangar capacity for 36 Swordfish-sized aircraft and a single hangar, but carried up to 57 aircraft with a permanent deck park, while the 23,400-ton featured increased hangar capacity with a upper hangar and the addition of a lower hangar, forward of the after elevator, which had a total capacity of 52 Swordfish-sized aircraft or a mix of 48 late-war aircraft in the hangar plus 24 aircraft in a permanent deck park, but carried up to 81 aircraft with a deck park. 

The 27,500-ton USN had a hangar that was designed to handle a mix of 72 prewar USN aircraft. but carried up to 104 late-war aircraft using both the hangar and a permanent deck park. The experience of World War II caused the USN to change their design policy in favor of armored flight decks on much larger ships: &quot;The main armor carried on is the heavy armored flight deck. This was to prove a significant factor in the catastrophic fire and explosions that occurred on &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s flight deck in 1969. The US Navy learned its lesson the hard way during World War II when all its carriers had only armored hangar decks. All attack carriers built since the have had armored flight decks.&quot;

==Landing==


Landing arrangements were originally primitive, with aircraft simply being &quot;caught&quot; by a team of deck-hands who would run out from the wings of the flight deck and grab a part of the aircraft to slow it down. This dangerous procedure was only possible with early aircraft of low weight and landing speed. Arrangements of nets served to catch the aircraft should the latter fail, although this was likely to cause structural damage. A non-skid deck surface is important to prevent aircraft from sliding on a wet deck as the ship rolls.

Landing larger and faster aircraft on a flight deck was made possible through the use of arresting cables installed on the flight deck and a tailhook installed on the aircraft. Early carriers had a very large number of arrestor cables or &quot;wires&quot;. Current U.S. Navy carriers have three or four steel cables stretched across the deck at intervals which bring a plane, traveling at , to a complete stop in about . 

The cables are set to stop each aircraft at the same place on the deck, regardless of the size or weight of the plane. During World War II, large net barriers would be erected across the flight deck so aircraft could be parked on the forward part of the deck and recovered on the after part. This allowed increased complements but resulted in a lengthened launch and recovery cycle as aircraft were shuffled around the carrier to allow take-off or landing operations.

A barricade is an emergency system used if a normal arrestment cannot be made. Barricade webbing engages the wings of the landing aircraft, and momentum is transferred to the arresting engine.

==Cold War innovations==

===Angled===

The angled flight deck was invented by Royal Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) Dennis Cambell, as an outgrowth of design study initially begun in the winter of 1944–1945. A committee of senior Royal Navy officers decided that the future of naval aviation was in jets, whose higher speeds required that the carriers be modified to &quot;fit&quot; their needs. 

With this type of deck – also called a &quot;skewed deck&quot;, &quot;canted deck&quot;, &quot;waist angle deck&quot;, or the &quot;angle&quot; – the aft part of the deck is widened, and a separate runway dedicated to landing is positioned at an angle from the centreline. 

The angled flight deck was designed with the higher landing speeds of jet aircraft in mind, which would have required the entire length of a centreline flight deck to stop. The design also allowed for concurrent launch and recovery operations, and allowed aircraft failing to connect with the arrestor cables to abort the landing, accelerate, and relaunch (&quot;bolter&quot;) without risk to other parked or launching aircraft.
The redesign allowed for several other design and operational modifications, including the mounting of a larger island (improving both ship-handling and flight control), drastically simplified aircraft recovery and deck movement (aircraft now launched from the bow and landed on the angled flight deck, leaving a large open area amidships for arming and fueling), and damage control. Because of its utility in flight operations, the angled deck is now a defining feature of STOBAR and CATOBAR equipped aircraft carriers.

The angled flight deck was first tested in 1952 on by painting angled deck markings onto the centerline of the flight deck for touch-and-go landings. This was also tested on the same year. 

Despite the new markings, in both cases the arresting gear and barriers were still aligned with the centerline of the original deck. From September to December 1952, had a rudimentary sponson installed for true angled-deck tests, allowing for full arrested landings, which proved during trials to be superior. In 1953, &quot;Antietam&quot; trained with both U.S. and British naval units, proving the worth of the angled-deck concept. was modified with an overhanging angled flight deck in 1954. 

The U.S. Navy installed the decks as part of the SCB-125 upgrade for the and SCB-110/110A for the . In February 1955, became the first carrier to be constructed and launched with an angled deck, rather than having one retrofitted. This was followed in the same year by the lead ships of the British &quot;Majestic&quot; class () and the American ().

===Ski-jump===

A ski-jump converts part of the aircraft&#x27;s forward motion to upward motion through the use of a curved ramp located at the end of the flight deck. As a result, the aircraft starts out its flight with a positive rate-of-climb. This allows heavier aircraft to take off even though the lift generated is smaller. Gravity causes the upward velocity to decline, but the aircraft continues to accelerate after leaving the flight deck. By the time the upward velocity has decayed to zero, the aircraft is going fast enough to attain stable flight.

Ski-jumps can be used to enable conventional aircraft to takeoff on STOBAR aircraft carriers. They can also enable heavier payloads for STOVL aircraft.

===Flexible===
An idea tested, but never put into service, was the flexible or inflated, air-cushioned, &quot;rubber deck&quot;. In the early jet age it was recognised that eliminating the landing gear for carrier borne aircraft would improve the flight performance and range, since the space taken by the landing gear could be used to hold additional fuel tanks. This led to the concept of a deck that would absorb the energy of landing. 

With the introduction of jet aircraft the risk of damaging propellers was no longer an issue, though take off would require some sort of launching cradle. Tests were carried out with a de Havilland Sea Vampire flown by test pilot Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown onto a flexible deck fitted to . 

The deck consisted of a rubberised sheet fully supported on multiple layers of pressurised fire hose. Supermarine designed its Type 508 for rubber deck landings. The flexible deck idea was found to be technically feasible but was abandoned, as the weight of carrier aircraft increased and there were always doubts about the ability of an average pilot to land in this way. The Type 508 was subsequently developed into a conventional carrier aircraft, the Supermarine Scimitar.

The US Navy evaluated a shore-based flexible deck made by Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. using two modified Grumman F9F-7 Cougars. Three US pilots had participated in the British flexible deck trials at Farnborough and the US Navy, despite liaison with the British, partially redid the Farnborough trials, with 23 landings at Patuxent River, before cancelling the project in March 1956 for similar reasons.

==Alternatives==
During the Cold War era, multiple unorthodox alternatives to the conventional flight deck were proposed and, in some cases, experimented with.

The Shipborne Containerised Air-defence System (SCADS) was a proposed modular kit to convert a RO-RO or container ship into aviation vessels, with one scheme allowing a container ship to be converted to a STOVL aircraft carrier in two days during an emergency and quick removal after use for storage. A prefabricated flight deck and ski jump would allow six Sea Harriers and two helicopters to be operated, with shipping containers providing hangarage for the aircraft and housing their support systems and personnel as well as defensive systems and missiles. Several variants of the SCADS concept were devised for different missions roles; one implementation was tailored towards helicopter operations for example. It was effectively a modern equivalent to the Second World War-era merchant aircraft carrier.

The Skyhook system was developed by British Aerospace, involving the use of a crane with a top mating mechanism hung over the sea to catch and release VTOL aircraft, such as the Harrier jump jet. The system could be installed on ships of various configurations and sizes, even those as small as frigates, enabling virtually any Royal Navy ship to deploy a handful of Harriers. It was intended for the Skyhook to enable not only the launch and recovery of such aircraft, but to enable rapid rearming and refuelling operations to be performed. The system was marketed to various foreign customers into the 1990s, such as to enable Japan&#x27;s fleet of helicopter destroyers to operate Harriers by installing the Skyhook on board. Perhaps the most elaborate implementation proposed was the application of the Skyhook to large submarines, such as the Russian , to produce a submarine aircraft carrier.

The Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 was a prototype jet-propelled flying boat fighter, developed during the 1940s with the intention of eliminating the monopoly held by aircraft carriers on launching jet fighters. Described as being the first water-based aircraft to harness jet propulsion in the world, the SR.A/1 attracted interest from both British and American officials, with data on the project being transferred. However, officials concluded that the concept had been rendered obsolete in comparison to increasingly capable land-based fighters, together with the inability to resolve engine difficulties, compelling a termination of work. During June 1951, the SR.A/1 prototype (TG263) flew for the last time.

During the early 1950s, Saunders-Roe worked on a new fighter design, designated &quot;Project P.121&quot;, that featured skis aircraft publication &quot;Flight&quot; referred to it as the &quot;Saunders-Roe Hydroski&quot; with the aim of bringing its performance closer to that of land-based aircraft. By adopting hydroskis and dispensing with the hull approach of the SR.A/1, no concessions to hydrodynamic requirements were imposed upon the fuselage. On 29 January 1955, the company decided not to proceed with the construction of a prototype, the proposal having not attracted any official support.

The Convair F2Y Sea Dart was a supersonic seaplane jet fighter that had skis rather than wheels. In the late 1940s, the United States Navy feared that supersonic aircraft would stall at low speeds required for a carrier arresting gear, and therefore would not be able to land on a conventional aircraft carrier. The Sea Dart would land on (smooth) water; then be lowered and raised from the sea via crane. The Navy also considered combining the Sea Dart with the unorthodox approach of a submarine aircraft carrier that could carry up to three such aircraft inside purpose-built pressure chambers. They would have been raised by a portside elevator aft of the sail and either take off on their own from a smooth sea or be catapult launched from the aft in a higher sea. During the test flight phase, the hydro-skis generated violent vibrations during takeoff and landing, while a fatal crash caused by structural failure also marred the programme; the Navy opted to cancel all production aircraft.

The United States Navy held considerable interest in the submarine aircraft carrier concept during the late 1940s. A study performed in 1946 envisioned very large submarines, ranging from to in length, to carry two XA2J Super Savage bombers for the strategic nuclear strike mission, or alternatively four F2H Banshee fighters. Another proposal would have involved the conversion of redundant Second World War-era fleet submarines to enable carriage and launch of a seaplane model of the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft, which would have been equipped with hydro-skis for takeoff similar to those of the Sea Dart.

<text>The Iranian parliamentary elections of February 20 and May 7, 2004 were a victory for Islamic conservatives over the reformist parties. Assisting the conservative victory was the disqualification of about 2500 reformist candidates earlier in January.

==Background==
The first round of the 2004 elections to the Iranian Parliament were held on February 20, 2004. Most of the 290 seats were decided at that time but a runoff was held 2½ months later on May 7, 2004, for the remaining thirty-nine seats where no candidate gained sufficient votes in the first round. In the Tehran area, the runoff elections were postponed to be held with the Iranian presidential election of June 17, 2005.

The elections took place amidst a serious political crisis following the January 2004 decision to ban about 2500 candidates — nearly half of the total — including 80 sitting Parliament deputies. This decision, by the conservative Council of Guardians vetting body, &quot;shattered any pretense of Iranian democracy&quot;, according to some observers.

The victims of the ban were reformists, particularly members of the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF), and included several leaders. Prominent banned candidates included Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Mirdamadi, Mohammad-Reza Khatami and Jamileh Kadivar. In many parts of Iran, there weren&#x27;t even enough independent candidates approved, so the reformists couldn&#x27;t form an alliance with them. Out of a possible 285 seats (5 seats are reserved for religious minorities: Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians), the participating reformist parties could only introduce 191 candidates. Many pro-reform social and political figures, including Shirin Ebadi, asked people not to vote (although some reformist party leaders, such as those in the IIPF, specifically mentioned they would not be boycotting the elections). Some moderate reformists, however, including President Mohammad Khatami, urged citizens to vote in order to deny the conservative candidates an easy majority.

Conservative political groups included the Militant Clergy Association and the Islamic Coalition Society. Liberal–reformist groups included the Militant Clerics Society, Islamic Iran Participation Front, Construction Executives, and Worker&#x27;s House.

The day before the election, the reformist newspapers &quot;Yas-e-no&quot; and &quot;Shargh&quot; were banned.

===Analysis===
Political historian Ervand Abrahamian credits the victory of Abadgaran and other conservatives in the 2004 elections (as well as the 2003 and 2005 elections) to the conservatives&#x27; retention of their core base of 25% of the voting population; their recruiting of war veteran candidates; their wooing of independents using the issue of national security; and most of all &quot;because large numbers of women, college students, and other members of the salaried middle class&quot; who make up the reformists&#x27; base of support &quot;stayed home&quot;. Pro-reform voters were discouraged by division in the reform movement and by the disqualifying of reform candidates from running for office.

==Official statistics (from the Ministry of Interior)==
* Total candidates: 4679
* Decided in the first round: 225 of 289 seats
* To be decided in the second round: 64 seats
* Number of voting booths in the country: 39,885
* Number of staff: about 600,000
* Number of voters: 23,725,724 (1,971,748 in Tehran and its suburbs)

<text>Pacatian (; ; died &quot;c.&quot; 248) was a usurper in the Danube area of the Roman Empire during the time of Philip the Arab.

He is known from coins, and from mentions in Zosimus and Zonaras, who say that he was an officer in one of the Danube legions. According to Zosimus, the revolts of Pacatian in Moesia (he probably controlled Viminacium) and Jotapian in Syria prompted Philip to make an offer to the Roman Senate to step down, but the senator Decius (who was sent by Philip to deal with the rebellion), correctly predicted that Pacatian would soon be killed by his own men before his own arrival.

<doc id="476548" wikidata="Q715237" url="?curid=476548" title="Sponsianus">
<text>Sponsianus, also known in English as Sponsian, may have been a Roman usurper during the third century AD. His existence is implied by a series of coins bearing his name, ostensibly part of a hoard excavated in the eighteenth century. 

No corresponding figure named Sponsianus is mentioned in any ancient sources, and the coins are widely believed to be the work of modern forgers. However, a study of wear marks on the coins published in November 2022 concluded that the coins were authentic, supporting Sponsian&#x27;s existence as a historical figure. The study&#x27;s methodology and conclusions have been criticized by a number of scholars.

Scholars who accept the historicity of Sponsianus date his activity to the Crisis of the Third Century, often locating him in the particularly unstable province of Dacia. More precise dating is a matter of controversy: some scholars have conjectured that he may have proclaimed himself emperor in the 260s, after Dacia was cut off from the rest of the Empire, or in the early 270s after it was formally abandoned by Aurelian. Others contend he may have been active earlier, during the reign of Philip the Arab or his son, Philip II.

==Discussion==
=== Physical description and provenance ===
The sole evidence for the existence of Sponsianus is his name on a few double-aurei reportedly uncovered in a coin-hoard in Transylvania in 1713, and subsequently dispersed among several collections. One was kept in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow University, alongside three coins depicting other figures also claimed to have been from the hoard. Another entered the bequest of Baron Samuel von Brukenthal, a Habsburg governor of Transylvania.

The aurei are highly unusual for the period. Firstly, the obverse of the coin features unusual lettering and gives Sponsianus&#x27; name in the genitive case (instead of the usual nominative). Second, the reverse of the coin is a copy of a Republican denarius struck in 135 BC with an apparently corrupted inscription. The coins are also unusually heavy, and appear to have been cast, rather than produced using the more usual stamping process.

=== Traditional numismatic analysis ===

The traditional consensus among numismatists has been to regard the coins as modern forgeries. As early as 1828, Eckhel noted the strangeness of the coins and concluded against the historicity of Sponsianus. In 1868, the French numismatist Henri Cohen dismissed them as &quot;very poor quality modern forgeries,&quot; and 1923 analysis, concluding that the coins were modern forgeries, is considered definitive by many numismatists. More recently, the coins were described as &quot;strange and barbaric&quot; in &quot;Roman Imperial Coinage&quot;, a British catalogue of Roman Imperial currency, and some numismatists have objected to their inclusion in the catalogue altogether. Other scholars concur with the &quot;RIC&quot;, and classify the coins as third-century imitations of Roman coinage, while still others contend that the coins can be ascribed to a historical usurper Sponsianus. In general, ancient historians have been more willing to accept the historicity of Sponsianus and the authenticity of the coins.

=== 2022 study and reactions ===

In 2022, a group of scientists led by Paul Pearson of University College London argued that scratch marks on one coin bearing Sponsianus&#x27; name and image, visible under an electron microscope, proved that the coin circulated in antiquity. The group also conducted a chemical analysis, concluding the earth deposits found in the coin&#x27;s recesses showed that the coins had been buried in soil for hundreds of years. The study attracted significant scholarly and media attention, and led the Brukenthal Museum in Sibiu to reclassify another coin bearing Sponsianus&#x27; image as genuine.

In the aftermath of Pearson&#x27;s analysis, several researchers have criticized the study and its conclusions. In an article for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Mary Beard suggests that the unusual features of the Sponsianus coin are better explained by its being an eighteenth-century forgery. Richard Abdy, the curator of the collection of Roman coins at the British Museum, condemned the study, stating &quot;they&#x27;ve gone full fantasy.&quot; In the Journal &quot;Antigone&quot;, Alfred Deahl argued that the coins are forgeries, drawing attention to the unusual features of the coins as well as the oddness of the other coins purportedly found in the same hoard. These doubts are echoed by Aleksander Bursche and Kyrylo Myzgin, who add that the very early finding and low gold content may count against the coins&#x27; authenticity. Alice Sharpless from the American Numismatic Society summarized criticism of the Pearson study by writing &quot;the evidence of wear and of surface deposits cannot be shown conclusively not to have occurred in the modern period... Unless further study can provide more certain answers, it seems that these coins should continue to be regarded as modern forgeries.&quot;

Pearson&#x27;s study has attracted significant attention from Romanian numismatists and classicists. Emanuel Petac, President of the Romanian Numismatic Society, stated that the coin &quot;has nothing to do with the Roman world. Petac notes that the legend irregularly excludes his praenomen and cognomen, or whose son or grandson he is. Another Romanian academic, Florian-Matei Popescu, highlighted the lack of written attestations of Sponsianus or his name—though the name Sponsianus is attested in the Roman world in inscriptions, these are very rare. Popescu argues that if the coins are real, which he deems unlikely, they date to the reign of Philip the Arab, who opened a mint in Dacia making low-value bronzes to pay the army.

==The name Sponsianus==
The name &quot;Sponsianus&quot; is an authentic, but exceedingly rare, Roman name, derived from the Latin word &quot;spondere&quot;, to solemnly promise. Pearson notes only one instance, from a funerary inscription naming an obscure person called Nicodemus Sponsianus, dating from the early first century. This inscription was not published until 1726, several years after the supposed discovery of Sponsian&#x27;s coins, and Pearson regards this as an argument for their authenticity: a forger would not have known of the name. Two other instances appear in the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot;, a catalogue of known Latin inscriptions, all dating from the same period, while a further two inscriptions give the abbreviated form &quot;Sposianus&quot;; all five inscriptions are from Rome. One of the latter was published by Jan Gruter well before the first known appearance of the coins, and other examples are known besides these, so a forger might still have been aware of or guessed at the existence of such a name.

==Theories==
Scholars who accept the historicity of Sponsianus have proposed several possibilities for when and where Sponsianus would have been active. One explanation, based upon the other coins found with the aurei, would date Sponsian&#x27;s activity to the 240s, during the rule of Gordian III (AD 238–244) or Philip the Arab (AD 244–249). Based upon the location of his aurei, some scholars posit that he may have staged a revolt in Pannonia. Ilkka Syvänne places the revolt early in Philip&#x27;s reign, and identifies Sponsianus with the obscure Severus Hostilianus mentioned in later Byzantine histories (though he notes the evidence is circumstantial).

Another explanation is that he was a military commander who crowned himself as emperor when Dacia was cut off from the rest of the empire around 260. With an ongoing pandemic and civil war, and the empire being fragmented at the time, Sponsianus may have assumed supreme command to protect the military and civilian population of Dacia until order was restored. The Romans eventually evacuated Dacia between 271 and 275. According to Jesper Ericsson:

The Roman Empire in this period was highly unstable; many peripheral areas were left to fend for themselves. Dacia in particular was abandoned in the 270s by Aurelian after it was deemed too difficult to defend. Sponsianus may have found himself responsible for thousands of people, without support from the central regime of the empire, and surrounded by hostile tribes; in this context, Sponsianus taking the title of emperor has been characterized as an attempt to maintain order. He would have had access to a military force consisting of two legions there and their associated auxiliary personnel, totalling tens of thousands of soldiers. No other evidence has been found of Sponsianus&#x27; rule, and if he did exist, this would seem to indicate that Sponsianus was either uninterested or unsuccessful in expanding his territory.

<text>Shargh (; also as Sharq) is one of the most popular Reformist daily newspapers in Iran.

The owner is Mehdi Rahmanian, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Ali Dehghan and the editor-in-chief of online is Sina Rahimpour.

==History and profile==
&quot;Shargh&quot; was founded in 2003. The daily is managed by Mehdi Rahmanian. Its chief editor was Mohammad Ghouchani in its first period of publication. Mohammad Ghouchani and Mohammad Atrianfar, its ex-head of policy-making council, left &quot;Shargh&quot; in March 2007 and joined &quot;Ham-Mihan&quot;, another reformist newspaper managed by Gholamhossein Karbaschi.

Arash Karami, an Iranian journalist, described &quot;Shargh&quot; as the opposite of conservative paper &quot;Kayhan&quot; in terms of political stance.

==Bans==
&quot;Shargh&quot; had published 141 editions before the temporary ban by the Iranian judiciary system on 4 February 2004, one day before the parliament election, following the publication of an open letter from some members of the outgoing parliament to Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader. The letter was read to journalists by Mohsen Armin, one of the organizers of the MPs sit-in criticizing the settings of the Council of Guardians.

The situation got more interesting when Mehdi Rahmanian, &quot;Shargh&quot;″s manager in charge, met Saeed Mortazavi, Tehran&#x27;s general prosecutor, the next day to discuss a removal of the ban. After that, Rahmanian wrote a public letter asking for forgiveness, saying that he couldn&#x27;t confirm that the letter was actually from the MPs and signed by them, and that even in the case it was, it would have been a non-professional act to publish &quot;offensive&quot; texts.

Mortazavi announced that he had ordered the ban because of a request by the High Council of National Security, which Hassan Rowhani, the council&#x27;s chair, and Mohammad Khatami, the president, later denied on 20 and 23 February, respectively, mentioning the matter was not even discussed at the council&#x27;s meeting. The ban was removed on 28 February 2004, and &quot;Shargh&quot; was published again from 3 March 2004. &quot;Shargh&quot; was shut down again on 11 September 2006 by the Iranian government.

In March 2007, Iran&#x27;s hardline judiciary allowed a number of banned reformist dailies to republish, including the flagship centrist daily &quot;Shargh&quot; after a half-year ban. However, the daily was banned after publishing an interview with Iranian-Canadian poet Saghi Ghahraman in August 2007. The interview was viewed as counter-revolutionary and immoral by the press directory.

The digital newspaper &quot;Your Middle East&quot; reported on 26 September 2012 that &quot;Shargh&quot; had been banned over a controversial cartoon that shows a group of men covering each other&#x27;s eyes with ribbons. The newspaper, one of the few remaining dailies close to the reformists, published the cartoon on 25 September and provoked anger among Iranian lawmakers as well as officials, who said the cartoon insulted Iranian fighters in the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88). Iranian soldiers usually had ribbons reading holy words on their foreheads during the war.

<text>Yas-e No () was a reformist daily newspaper in Tehran, Iran, unofficially an outlet of the Islamic Iran Participation Front. The paper was in circulation between 2002 and 2009 with long interruptions.

==History and profile==
&quot;Yas-e No&quot; was launched in March 2002. On 19 February 2004, the Iranian judiciary banned the newspaper, perhaps temporarily, only one day before the parliamentary election, after the paper published an open letter from some members of the outgoing parliament to Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader. The letter was read to journalists by Mohsen Armin, one of the organizers of the sit-in by MPs criticizing the vetting of candidates by the Council of Guardians. Saeed Mortazavi, Tehran&#x27;s general prosecutor, announced that he had ordered the ban because of a request by the Supreme National Security Council. Hassan Rouhani, then the council&#x27;s chair, and Mohammad Khatami, the then president, denied this assertion on 20 and 23 February, respectively, saying that the matter was not even discussed at the council&#x27;s meeting.

After five-year ban the paper was allowed to publish in May 2009. However, following the presidential election the paper was again banned on 11 June 2009.

<text>A submarine tender, in British English a submarine depot ship, is a type of depot ship that supplies and supports submarines.

==Development==

Submarines are small compared to most oceangoing vessels, and generally cannot carry large amounts of food, fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies, or a full array of maintenance equipment and personnel. The tender carries all these, and either meets submarines at sea to replenish them or provides these services while docked at a port near the submarines&#x27; operations zone. In some navies, the tenders were equipped with workshops for maintenance, and as floating dormitories with relief crews.

With the increased size and automation of modern submarines, plus in some navies the introduction of nuclear power, tenders are no longer as necessary for fuel as they once were.

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s first submarine depot ship was .

===Chile===
The term used in the Chilean Navy is &quot;submarine mother ship&quot;, as for example the BMS (buque madre de submarinos) &quot;Almirante Merino&quot;.

===China===
China&#x27;s Type 926 submarine support ship is capable of replenishing submarines and rescuing those in distress.

===France===
During the 1930s and World War II, the French Navy and later the Free French Naval Forces operated the submarine tender .

===Germany===
Unable to operate a significant number of conventional surface tenders during World War II, Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; used Type XIV submarines (nicknamed &quot;milk cows&quot;) for replenishment at sea.

===Japan===
Prior to and during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy operated submarine tenders. It also operated , a seaplane tender designed and equipped to transport and support 12 midget submarines in addition to seaplanes, and a number of submarines designed to transport, launch, and recover midget submarines.

===The Netherlands===
The Royal Netherlands Navy has one submarine support vessel, , commissioned in 1987, as a replacement of , then known as HNLMS Mercuur (A 856). Commissioned in 1956, as an ocean going Aggressive-class minesweeper, built in the US, and later used as a submarine tender.

===Russia===
The Russian Navy decommissioned all its Don and Ugra-class tenders inherited from the Soviet Navy by 2001. The last remaining ship of this class was , initially sold to the Indian Navy in 1968 for use with their fleet of s. She was reportedly decommissioned in July 2006.

===United Kingdom===
In the Royal Navy, the term used for a submarine tender is &quot;submarine depot ship&quot;, for example and .

===United States===

In the United States Navy, submarine tenders are considered auxiliary ships, with the hull classification symbol &quot;AS&quot;. , the U.S. Navy maintains two submarine tenders, and .

<doc id="476559" wikidata="Q1228562" url="?curid=476559" title="Discover Card">
<text>Discover is a credit card brand issued primarily in the United States. It was introduced by Sears in 1985. When launched, Discover did not charge an annual fee and offered a higher-than-normal credit limit. A subsequent innovation was &quot;Cashback Bonus&quot; on purchases.

Most cards with the Discover brand are issued by Discover Bank, formerly the Greenwood Trust Company. Discover transactions are processed through the Discover Network payment network. In 2005, Discover Financial Services acquired Pulse, an electronic funds transfer network, allowing it to market and issue debit and ATM cards. In February 2006, Discover Financial Services announced that it would begin offering Discover debit cards to other financial institutions, made possible by the acquisition of Pulse.

Discover is the third largest credit card brand in the U.S., with 60.6 million cardholders or about 8% of cards in circulation, placing it well behind Visa (48%) and Mastercard (36%), but slightly ahead of American Express (7.5%).

== History ==
At the time Discover was introduced, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States. It had purchased the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage organization and Coldwell, Banker &amp; Company (real estate) in 1981 as an attempt to add financial services to its portfolio of customer services. Ray Kennedy Sr., father of country singer Ray Kennedy and the credit manager for Sears, conceived the card. After a trial period in 1985, starting with a $26.77 purchase at an Atlanta Sears on September 17, the actual launch was pushed through by Philip J. Purcell and Mitchell M. Merin, the company&#x27;s senior vice president for corporate administration and manager of financial analysis, respectively. Together with the Discover Card (and its issuing bank, the Greenwood Trust Company, owned by Sears), this was named the Sears Financial Network. Early Discover Cards bore a small embossed symbol representing the Sears Tower, then the company&#x27;s headquarters.

Discover was part of Dean Witter, and then Morgan Stanley, until 2007, when Discover Financial Services became an independent company. Novus was once the major processing center that partnered with the company. The Novus logo was retired, replaced by the Discover Network logo.
Unlike other attempts at creating a credit card to rival MasterCard and Visa, such as Citibank&#x27;s Choice card, Discover gained a large national consumer base. It carried no annual fee, which was uncommon at the time, and offered a typically higher credit limit than similar cards. Cardholders could also earn a &quot;Cashback Bonus&quot;, in which a percentage of the amount spent would be refunded to the account (from 1% to 5%), depending on how much the card was used. Discover was also noteworthy for being the only credit card accepted by the U.S. Customs Service to pay customs duty, effective February 19, 1987. Since it did not charge a percentage fee to retailers, unlike Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, Discover was also the only credit card accepted at Sam&#x27;s Club; the retailer has since started to accept MasterCard and American Express (see below). A 1989 study found that Discover had strong consumer adoption in the U.S.; the number of households with Discover cards increased by 2.1 million, or 14 percent, in 1989. In this same year, Discover also signed a restaurant in Delaware as its 1 millionth merchant in its payment network.

The plan to create a one-stop financial-services center in Sears stores was not as successful as Sears had hoped, and its promotion of Discover was thought both to hurt Sears turnover and to restrict the card&#x27;s potential. Other retailers resisted it, as they were developing their own credit products and they believed they would be helping their competitor. Sears began to face difficulties in the late 1980s in light of these developments, and with strong competition both from Walmart and from so-called category killers such as Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. Discover&#x27;s introduction was costly; Sears&#x27;s Discover credit card operations accounted for a loss of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 1986, and a loss of $25.8 million in the first quarter of 1987.

In 1993, Sears spun off its Dean Witter division into a new publicly-traded company, and began to accept MasterCard and Visa in addition to its store credit card and Discover. Discover became part of the Dean Witter financial services firm, and the new company was called Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co. In 1997, this company merged with Morgan Stanley to become Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co. In 1999, this company rebranded itself as Discover Financial Services, Inc.

=== Discover Bank ===
The Greenwood Trust Company was founded in 1911 and is based in Greenwood, Delaware. It was acquired by Discover Financial Services in 1985 and renamed Discover Bank in 2000. The original location of the Greenwood Trust Company on East Market Street in Greenwood is now the town hall and police station.

=== Global alliance ===

Starting around 2005, to increase acceptance around the world, Discover has formed several agreements with other payment networks internationally. This allows Discover cardholders to perform transactions while traveling abroad. Vice versa, cardholders of other countries may utilize their cards at U.S. merchants that accept Discover. Some major examples include:
*Diners Club International worldwide
* BC Card in South Korea
* JCB in Japan
* RuPay in India
* TROY in Turkey
* UnionPay in China
* Verve in Nigeria
* DinaCard in Serbia
* Elo in Brazil
* ATH in Puerto Rico
* Mercury throughout the Middle East
* NAPAS in Vietnam
* Prosa in Mexico

Currently, Discover is accepted in 185 countries.

== Business developments ==

In October 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States chose not to review a ruling in Discover&#x27;s favor that challenged exclusionary policies of Visa and MasterCard, stating that MasterCard and Visa were violating antitrust regulations. Before this ruling, Visa and MasterCard would not allow banks to issue a Discover or American Express card if they issued a Visa or MasterCard. Within days of the court ruling, Discover filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking damages from Visa and MasterCard.

Shortly after the 2004 Supreme Court ruling, Discover struck its first deal to have its cards issued by another financial institution, GE Consumer Finance, which began to issue credit cards for retailer Walmart and its wholesale warehouse stores, Sam&#x27;s Club. Transactions were processed on the Discover Network. Sam&#x27;s Club exclusively accepted Discover for many years; since November 2006, it has also accepted MasterCard for purchases. In April 2014, Walmart announced that they were ending their relationship with Discover and would begin converting all Discover-branded cards to Mastercard beginning in June 2014.

HSBC has issued Discover-branded credit cards processed through the Discover Network since its acquisition of card issuer Metris in late 2005. Metris had originally signed an agreement with Discover in September 2005, three months prior to the HSBC acquisition.

In September 2012, Discover was ordered to pay over $200 million in fines and customer reimbursements to settle accusations by U.S. federal regulators that it had engaged in deceptive telemarketing tactics.

=== Acquisition by Capital One ===

In February 2024, Capital One announced that it would acquire Discover Financial Services in an all-stock transaction valued at $35.3 billion. If the deal is approved by regulators, the combined company will become the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. The deal has faced scrutiny from antitrust experts.

== Advertising ==

From 1998 to 2007, Discover Card owned a billboard at One Times Square, just above the flagpole where the Times Square Ball is placed, until Toshiba bought the space. As a result, its logo could be seen on national television during New Year&#x27;s Eve, while the ball dropped. Discover also sponsored the ball drop itself.

From its opening in 2001 to 2012, Sugarloaf Mills Mall in Lawrenceville, Georgia, was named Discover Mills in a naming rights partnership with Discover Card. The slogan for the mall was &quot;Where Discover Card is the Smart Choice&quot;. It was the first shopping mall to have granted naming rights to interested companies.

Since 2008, Discover has been the official credit-card partner of the National Hockey League. As part of this deal, Discover offers team- and league-branded credit cards as well as a 10% discount on purchases made from the NHL&#x27;s online store using Discover.

In 2024, actress Jennifer Coolidge starred in Discover Card&#x27;s television commercials.

<doc id="476564" wikidata="Q36793" url="?curid=476564" title="Thracian language">
<text>The Thracian language () is an extinct and poorly attested language, spoken in ancient times in Southeast Europe by the Thracians. The linguistic affinities of the Thracian language are poorly understood, but it is generally agreed that it was an Indo-European language.

The point at which Thracian became extinct is a matter of dispute. However, it is generally accepted that Thracian was still in use in the 6th century AD: Antoninus of Piacenza wrote in 570 that there was a monastery in the Sinai, at which the monks spoke Greek, Latin, Syriac, Egyptian, and Bessian – a Thracian dialect.

A classification put forward by Harvey Mayer, suggests that Thracian (and Dacian) belonged to the Baltic branch of Indo-European, or at least is closer to Baltic than any other Indo-European branch. However, this theory has not achieved the status of a general consensus among linguists. These are among many competing hypotheses regarding the classification and fate of Thracian.

== Geographic distribution ==
The Thracian language or languages were spoken in what is now Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Northern Greece, European Turkey and in parts of Bithynia (North-Western Asiatic Turkey).

== Remnants of the Thracian language ==
Little is known for certain about the Thracian language, since no text has been satisfactorily deciphered. Some of the longer inscriptions may be Thracian in origin but they may simply reflect jumbles of names or magical formulas.

Enough Thracian lexical items have survived to show that Thracian was a member of the Indo-European language family.

Besides the aforementioned inscriptions, Thracian may be attested through personal names, toponyms, hydronyms, , divine names, etc. and by a small number of words cited in Ancient Greek texts as being specifically Thracian.

There are 23 words mentioned by ancient sources considered explicitly of Thracian origin and known meaning. Of the words that are preserved in ancient glossaries, in particular by Hesychius, only three dozen can be considered &quot;Thracian&quot;. However, Indo-European scholars have pointed out that &quot;even the notion that what the ancients called &quot;Thracian&quot; was a single entity is unproven.&quot; The table below lists potential cognates from Indo-European languages, but most of them have not found general acceptance within Indo-European scholarship. Not all lexical items in Thracian are assumed to be from the Proto-Indo-European language, some non-IE lexical items in Thracian are to be expected.

== Inscriptions ==
The following are the longest inscriptions preserved. The remaining ones are mostly single words or names on vessels and other artifacts. No translation has been accepted by the larger Indo-European community of scholars.

=== Ezerovo inscription ===
Only four Thracian inscriptions of any length have been found. The first is a gold ring found in 1912 in the village of Ezerovo (Plovdiv Province of Bulgaria); the ring was dated to the 5th century BC. The ring features an inscription in a Greek script consisting of 8 lines, the eighth of which is located on the rim of the rotating disk; it reads without any spaces between:
Dimitar Dechev (Germanised as &quot;D. Detschew&quot;) separates the words as follows:

=== Kyolmen inscription ===

A second inscription, hitherto undeciphered, was found in 1965 near the village of , Varbitsa Municipality, dating to the sixth century BC. Written in a Greek alphabet variant, it is possibly a tomb stele inscription similar to the Phrygian ones; Peter A. Dimitrov&#x27;s transcription thereof is:

:ΙΛΑΣΝΛΕΤΕΔΝΛΕΔΝΕΝΙΔΑΚΑΤΡΟΣΟ
:ΕΒΑ·ΡΟΖΕΣΑΣΝΗΝΕΤΕΣΑΙΓΕΚΟΑ
:ΝΒΛΑΒΑΗΓΝ
i.e.
:ilasnletednlednenidakatroso
:eba·rozesasnēnetesaigekoa
:nblabaēgn

=== Duvanlii inscription ===
A third inscription is again on a ring, found in , Kaloyanovo Municipality, next to the left hand of a skeleton. It dates to the 5th century BC. The ring has the image of a horseman with the inscription surrounding the image. It is only partly legible (16 out of the initial 21):

The word &quot;mezenai&quot; is interpreted to mean &#x27;Horseman&#x27;, and a cognate to Illyrian &quot;Menzanas&quot; (as in &quot;Juppiter/Jove Menzanas&quot; &#x27;Juppiter of the foals&#x27; or &#x27;Juppiter on a horse&#x27;); Albanian &quot;mëz&quot; &#x27;foal&#x27;; Romanian &quot;mînz&quot; &#x27;colt, foal&#x27;; Latin &quot;mannus&quot; &#x27;small horse, pony&#x27;; Gaulish &quot;manduos&quot; &#x27;pony&#x27; (as in tribe name &quot;Viromandui&quot; &#x27;men who own ponies&#x27;).

== Classification ==
Due to a paucity of evidence required to establish a linguistic connection, the Thracian language, in modern linguistic textbooks, is usually treated either as its own branch of Indo-European, or is grouped with Dacian, together forming a Daco-Thracian branch of IE. Older textbooks often grouped it also with Illyrian or Phrygian. The belief that Thracian was close to Phrygian is no longer popular and has mostly been discarded.

There is a fringe belief that Thraco-Dacian forms a branch of Indo-European along with Baltic, but a Balto-Slavic linguistic unity is so overwhelmingly accepted by the Indo-European linguistic community that this hypothesis does not pass muster.

== Fate of the Thracians and their language ==
According to the 19th-century Greek educator Vlasios Skordelis, when Thracians were subjugated by Alexander the Great they finally assimilated to Greek culture and became as Greek as Spartans and Athenians, although he considered the Thracian language as a form of Greek. According to Crampton (1997) most Thracians were eventually Hellenized or Romanized, with the last remnants surviving in remote areas until the 5th century. According to Marinov (2015) the Thracians were likely completely Romanized and Hellenized after the last contemporary references to them of the 6th century.

Another author believes that the interior of Thrace was never Romanized or Hellenized (Trever, 1939). This was followed also by Slavonization. According to Weithmann (1978) when the Slavs migrated, they encountered only a very superficially Romanized Thracian and Dacian population, which had not strongly identified itself with Imperial Rome, while Greek and Roman populations (mostly soldiers, officials, merchants) abandoned the land or were killed. Because Pulpudeva survived as Plovdiv in Slavic languages, not under Philippopolis, some authors suggest that Thracian was not completely obliterated in the 7th century.

<doc id="476572" wikidata="Q7086777" url="?curid=476572" title="Ilkley Roman Fort">
<text>Ilkley Roman Fort is a Roman fort on the south bank of the River Wharfe, at the centre of the modern town of Ilkley, a Victorian spa town in West Yorkshire, England.

==Identification==
The traditional view is that &quot;Olicana&quot; is the fort at Ilkley, but the identification is not settled. Ptolemy mentions &quot;Olikana&quot; in his &quot;Geographia&quot; (c. 150), although Rivet and Smith give &quot;Olenacum&quot; as the proper form of the name, rejecting Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Olikana&quot; as corrupt. The 1086 Domesday Book gives &quot;Ilecliue&quot; also variants &quot;Illecliue&quot;, &quot;Illiclei&quot; and &quot;Illicleia&quot; for Ilkley. Modern scholarship has, however, suggested that the Roman name would be better applied to the fort at Elslack (&quot;Eleslac&quot; in Domesday Book) near Skipton.

Rivet and Smith suggest the name &quot;Verbeia&quot; instead, this being the Roman name for the River Wharfe. An altar-stone dedicated to the goddess Verbeia is thought to originate from the site.

==History==
The first fort at Ilkley was founded by Agricola around 80 AD and was largely constructed of wood, but this was later abandoned in the 120s. A second fort was erected around 161 AD which survived for 30 years, before being burnt down, perhaps during a documented rebellion by the inhabitants of northern Britain. It was immediately replaced by a stone fort which survived until the end of the Roman period. The fort was abandoned in the late 4th or early 5th century.

A substantial civil settlement, the &quot;vicus&quot;, formed the nucleus of the village that followed. Excavations have yet to reveal continuous habitation from Roman times, but it is quite likely that a village established itself within the ramparts of the fort following the Roman departure. Anglo-Saxon settlement probably did not take place until well into the seventh century, and the sculptured crosses are evidence of a church here in the eighth and ninth centuries.

==The site today==
A wall, once part of the fort, can still be seen from the back of Ilkley Manor House, which stands on the site. Around the area are four signs showing the edges of the walls of the fort. The area of the fort extends underneath the Manor House and nearby All Saints Parish Church whilst the vicus probably existed from the car park in the centre of Ilkley to Christchurch on The Grove. The church and Manor House both have a collection of Roman altars and tombstones, Anglo-Saxon crosses, and Medieval tombstones. The Roman altars date to the reigns of Antoninus Pius (138 to 161), and Septimius Severus and his son Caracalla (211 to 217).

<doc id="476582" wikidata="Q151052" url="?curid=476582" title="Operation Bagration">
<text>Operation Bagration () was the codename for the 1944 Soviet Byelorussian strategic offensive operation (), a military campaign fought between 22 June and 19 August 1944 in Soviet Byelorussia in the Eastern Front of World War II, just over two weeks after the start of Operation Overlord in the west. It was during this operation that Nazi Germany was forced to fight simultaneously on two major fronts for the first time since the war began. The Soviet Union destroyed 28 of 34 divisions of Army Group Centre and completely shattered the German front line. The overall engagement is the largest defeat in German military history, with around 450,000 German casualties, while 300,000 other German soldiers were cut off in the Courland Pocket.

On 22 June 1944, the Red Army attacked Army Group Centre in Byelorussia, with the objective of encircling and destroying its main component armies. By 28 June, the German 4th Army had been destroyed, along with most of the Third Panzer and Ninth Armies. The Red Army exploited the collapse of the German front line to encircle German formations in the vicinity of Minsk in the Minsk Offensive and destroy them, with Minsk liberated on 4 July. With the end of effective German resistance in Byelorussia, the Soviet offensive continued on to Lithuania, Poland and Romania over the course of July and August.

The Red Army successfully used the strategies of Soviet deep battle and maskirovka (deception) to their full extent for the first time, albeit with continuing heavy losses. Operation Bagration diverted German mobile reserves from the Lublin–Brest and Lvov–Sandomierz areas to the central sectors, enabling the Soviets to undertake the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive and Lublin–Brest Offensive. This allowed the Red Army to reach the Vistula River and Warsaw, which in turn put Soviet forces within striking distance of Berlin, conforming to the concept of Soviet deep operations—striking into the enemy&#x27;s strategic depths.

==Background==
Germany&#x27;s Army Group Centre had previously proven difficult to counter, as the Soviet defeat in Operation Mars had shown. However, by June 1944, despite shortening its front line, it was exposed following the defeats of Army Group South in the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of Kiev, the Dnieper–Carpathian offensive and the Crimean offensive in the late summer, autumn, and winter of 1943–44. In the north, Army Group North was also pushed back, leaving Army Group Center&#x27;s lines protruding towards the east and at risk of losing contact with neighbouring army groups.

The German High Command expected the next Soviet offensive to fall against Army Group North Ukraine (Field Marshal Walter Model), and it lacked the necessary intelligence capabilities to discover the Soviets&#x27; true intentions.

The Wehrmacht had redeployed one-third of Army Group Centre&#x27;s artillery, half of its tank destroyers, and 88 per cent of tanks to the south. The entire operational reserve on the Eastern front (18 Panzer and mechanised divisions, stripped from Army Groups North and Centre) was deployed to Model&#x27;s sector, leaving Army Group Centre with a total of only 580 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns. German lines were thinly held; for example, the 9th Army sector had 143 soldiers per km of the front.

A key factor in the subsequent collapse of Army Group Center during Operation Bagration was the Soviet Dnieper–Carpathian offensive in Ukraine. The success of this Soviet offensive had convinced the (Army High Command, OKH) that the southern sector of the Eastern Front would be the staging area for the main Soviet summer offensive of 1944. As a result, German forces stationed in the south, panzer divisions in particular, received priority in reinforcements. Furthermore, during this Soviet offensive in the spring of 1944, aimed at the city of Kovel, Army Group Center was significantly weakened by being forced to transfer nine divisions and numerous independent armored formations from its main front to its far right flank, located deep in the rear at the junction with Army Group South. These forces would then be attached to Army Group North Ukraine, the successor to Army Group South. This meant that Army Group Center was effectively deprived of well over 100,000 personnel and 552 tanks, assault guns and self-propelled guns at the start of Operation Bagration.

Operation Bagration, in combination with the neighbouring Lvov–Sandomierz offensive, launched a few weeks later in Ukraine, allowed the Soviet Union to recapture Byelorussia and Ukraine within its 1941 borders, advance into German East Prussia, but more importantly, the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive allowed the Red Army to reach the outskirts of Warsaw after gaining control of Poland east of the Vistula river. The campaign enabled the next operation, the Vistula–Oder Offensive, to come within sight of the German capital. The Soviets were initially surprised at the success of the Byelorussian operation which had nearly reached Warsaw. The Soviet advance encouraged the Warsaw Uprising against the German occupation forces.

The battle has been described as the triumph of the Soviet theory of the &quot;operational art&quot; because of the complete coordination of all the strategic front movements and signals traffic to fool the enemy about the target of the offensive. The military tactical operations of the Red Army successfully avoided the mobile reserves of the Wehrmacht and continually &quot;wrong-footed&quot; the German forces. Despite the massive forces involved, Soviet front commanders left their adversaries completely confused about the main axis of attack until it was too late.

==Soviet plans==
===Strategic aims and deception===
The Russian &quot;maskirovka&quot; is roughly equivalent to the English &quot;camouflage&quot;, but it has broader application in military use. During World War II the term was used by Soviet commanders to describe measures to create deception with the goal of inflicting surprise on the Wehrmacht forces.

The OKH expected the Soviets to launch a major offensive in the summer of 1944. The Stavka (Soviet High Command) considered a number of options. The timetable of operations between June and August had been decided on by 28 April 1944. The Stavka rejected an offensive in either the L&#x27;vov sector or the Yassy-Kishinev sectors owing to the presence of powerful enemy mobile forces equal in strength to the Soviet strategic fronts. Instead they suggested four options: an offensive into Romania and through the Carpathian Mountains, an offensive into the western Ukrainian SSR aimed at the Baltic coast, an attack into the Baltic, and an offensive in the Byelorussian SSR. The first two options were rejected as being too ambitious and open to flank attack. The third option was rejected on the grounds the enemy was too well prepared. The only safe option was an offensive into Byelorussia which would enable subsequent offensives from Ukraine into Poland and Romania.

The Soviet and German High Commands recognised western Ukraine as a staging area for an offensive into Poland. The Soviets, aware that the enemy would anticipate this, sought to deceive the Germans by creating a crisis in Byelorussia that would force the Germans to move their powerful armoured forces, fresh from their victory in the First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive in April–June 1944, to the central front to support Army Group Centre. This was the primary purpose of Bagration.

In order to maximize the chances of success, the maskirovka was a double bluff. The Soviets left four tank armies in the L&#x27;vov-Peremyshl area and allowed the Germans to know it. The attack into Romania in April–June further convinced the Soviets that the Axis forces in Romania needed removing and kept the Germans concerned about their defences there and in southern Poland, while drawing German forces to the L&#x27;vov sector. Once the offensive against Army Group Centre, which lacked mobile reserves and support, had been initiated, it would create a crisis in the central sector that would force the German armoured forces north to Byelorussia from Poland and Romania, despite the presence of powerful Soviet concentrations threatening German-occupied Poland.

The intent of the Soviets to strike their main blow towards the Vistula can be seen in the Red Army&#x27;s (albeit fragmented) order of battle. The Soviet general staff studies of both the Byelorussian and L&#x27;vov-Sandomierz operations reveal that the L&#x27;vov-Przemyśl operation received the overwhelming number of tank and mechanized corps. Six guards tank corps and six tank corps along with three guards mechanized and two mechanized corps were committed to the L&#x27;vov operation. This totaled twelve tank and five mechanized corps. In contrast, Operation Bagration″s Baltic and Byelorussian Fronts were allocated just eight tank and two mechanized corps. The 1st Byelorussian Front (an important part of the L&#x27;vov-Premyshl operation) is not mentioned on the Soviet battle order for the offensive. It contained a further six armies and was to protect the flank of the Lublin–Brest Offensive as well as engage in offensive operations in that area.

The bulk of tactical resources, in particular anti-tank artillery, was allocated to the 1st Ukrainian Front, the spearhead of the Vistula, L&#x27;vov-Premyshl operation. Thirty-eight of the 54 anti-tank regiments allocated to the Byelorussian-Baltic-Ukrainian operations were given to the 1st Ukrainian Front. This demonstrates that the Soviet plans for the L&#x27;vov operation were a major consideration and whoever planned the offensive was determined to hold the recently captured territory. The target for this operation was the Vistula bridgehead and the enormous anti-tank artillery forces helped repulse big counter-attacks by German armoured formations in August–October 1944. One American author suggests that these Soviet innovations were enabled, in part, by the provision of over 220,000 Dodge and Studebaker trucks by the United States to motorize the Soviet infantry.

Most of the aviation units, fighter aircraft and assault aviation (strike aircraft) were given to the L&#x27;vov operation and the protection of the 1st Ukrainian Front. Of the 78 fighter and assault aviation divisions committed to Bagration, 32 were allocated to the L&#x27;vov operation and contained more than was committed to the Byelorussian operation. This concentration of aviation was to protect the Vistula bridgeheads against air attack and to assault German counteroffensives from the air.

===Success of deception===
Towards the beginning of June 1944, the German High Command, Army Group Center and the army commands had identified a large part of the concentration against Army Group Centre, although they still considered that the main operation would be against Army Group North Ukraine. On 14 June, the Chief of Staff of Army Group Centre told General Kurt Zeitzler, the Chief of the Army General Staff, that &quot;...the Russian concentration here [in front of 9th Army] and at the Autobahn clearly indicates that the enemy attack will be aimed at the wings of the Army Group&quot;. On 10 June the OKH adopted the opinion of Army Group Centre in its estimate of the enemy situation:

On 19 June, Army Group Centre noted in its estimate of the enemy situation that the concentration of enemy air forces had become greater (4,500 out of 11,000) and that this left new doubts regarding OKH&#x27;s estimate. OKH saw no grounds for this supposition. Shortly before the beginning of the Soviet offensive, the army commands had detected some enemy forces near the front and had identified the places where the main Soviet attacks would take place, with the exception of 6th Guards Army near Vitebsk. The Soviet strategic reserves were not detected.

===Operations Rail War and Concert===
The start of Operation Bagration involved many Soviet partisan formations in the Byelorussian SSR, which were instructed to resume their attacks on railways and communications. From 19 June large numbers of explosive charges were placed on rail tracks and though many were cleared, they had a significant disruptive effect. The partisans were also used to mop up encircled German forces once the breakthrough and exploitation phases of the operation were completed.

==Disposition of forces==
The Stavka had committed approximately 1,670,300 combat and support personnel, approximately 32,718 artillery pieces and mortars, 5,818 tanks and assault guns and 7,799 aircraft. Army Group Centre&#x27;s strength was 486,000 combat personnel (849,000 total, including support personnel). The army group had 3,236 field guns and other artillery pieces (not including mortars) but only 495 operational tanks and assault guns and 920 available aircraft, of which 602 were operational. Army Group Centre was seriously short of mobile reserves: the demotorized 14th Infantry Division was the only substantial reserve formation, though the 20th Panzer Division, with 56 tanks, was positioned in the south near Bobruisk and the Panzergrenadier Division Feldherrnhalle, still in the process of forming, was also held in reserve. Furthermore, the Germans were supported by collaborationist troops such as the Lithuanian Security Police. The relatively static lines in Byelorussia had enabled the Germans to construct extensive field fortifications, with multiple trench lines to a depth of several kilometres and heavily mined defensive belts.

Besides the pro-German and pro-Soviet forces, some third-party factions were also involved in the fighting during Operation Bagration, most notably several resistance groups of the Polish Home Army. The latter mostly fought both the German as well as the Soviet-led troops. Some Home Army partisan factions regarded the Soviet Union as the greater threat, however, and negotiated ceasefires or even &quot;ad-hoc&quot; alliances with the German occupation forces. Such deals were condemned by the Home Army&#x27;s leadership, and several partisan officers who cooperated with the Germans against the Soviets were subsequently court-martialed. However, many times Polish Home Army fought Soviet troops in self-defence. Most often, Polish Home Army supported approaching Soviet forces and attacked German troops according to a plan of Operation Tempest. The plan was to cooperate with the advancing Red Army on a tactical level, while Polish civil authorities came out from underground and took power in Allied-controlled Polish territory. The plan failed, as Soviet troops would attack Polish Home Army groups after cooperation against German troops. Many Polish Home Army soldiers were killed in action, enlisted to the Soviet-controlled Polish People&#x27;s Army, murdered, imprisoned or deported.

===Order of battle===
===&quot;Feste Plätze&quot;===
The Wehrmacht&#x27;s forces were based on logistic lines of communications and centres, which on Hitler&#x27;s orders were declared &quot;Feste Plätze&quot; (fortified towns to be held at all costs) by OKH. General Jordan of 9th Army was very worried at how vulnerable this immobility made the army, correctly predicting that &quot;if a Soviet offensive breaks out the Army will either have to go over to a mobile defence or see its front smashed&quot;. Because the initial offensive in Belarus was thought to be a feint, the &quot;Feste Plätze&quot; spanned the entire length of the Eastern Front. Army Group Centre had &quot;Feste Plätze&quot; at Vitebsk, Orsha, Mogilev, Baranovichi, Minsk, Babruysk, Slutsk, and Vilnius.

==Battle – first phase: tactical breakthrough==

Operation Bagration was launched on a staggered schedule, with partisan attacks behind German lines beginning on 19–20 June. On the night of 21–22 June, the Red Army launched probing attacks on German frontline positions, combined with bombing raids on Wehrmacht&#x27;s lines of communication. The main offensive began in the early morning of 22 June, with an artillery bombardment of unprecedented scale against the defensive works. The initial assault achieved breakthroughs almost everywhere.

The first phase of Soviet deep operations, the &quot;deep battle&quot;, envisaged breaking through the tactical zones and forward German defences. Once these tactical offensives had been successful, fresh operational reserves were to exploit the breakthrough and the operational depths of the enemy front using powerful mechanized and armoured formations to encircle enemy concentrations on an Army Group scale.

===Vitebsk–Orsha offensive===

Army Group Centre&#x27;s northern flank was defended by the 3rd Panzer Army under the command of Georg-Hans Reinhardt; the lines ran through marshy terrain in the north, through a salient round the city of Vitebsk, to a sector north of the main Moscow–Minsk road, held by the 4th Army. It was opposed by the 1st Baltic Front of Hovhannes Bagramyan, and Ivan Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s 3rd Belorussian Front, which were given the task of breaking through the defences to the north and south of Vitebsk and cutting off the salient.

In the north, the 1st Baltic Front pushed the German IX Corps over the Dvina, while encircling the LIII Corps in the city of Vitebsk by 24 June, opening a gash in the frontline of wide. The Soviet command inserted its mobile forces to begin exploitation in operational depth. To the south, the 3rd Belorussian Front attacked the VI Corps, pushing it so far to the south that it came under the command of the 4th Army.

The LIII Corps had received permission to retreat on 24 June with three divisions, while leaving one division behind in the &quot;fester Platz Vitebsk&quot;. However, by the time the order arrived, the city was already encircled. General Friedrich Gollwitzer, the commander of the Vitebsk &quot;strongpoint&quot;, decided to disobey the order and have all units of his corps break out at the same time. Abandoning its heavy equipment, the corps began a breakout attempt in the morning of 26 June but quickly ran into Soviet roadblocks outside the city. Vitebsk was taken by 29 June, with the entire LIII Corps of 28,000 men eliminated from the German order of battle.

The 3rd Belorussian Front simultaneously opened operations against the 4th Army&#x27;s XXVII Corps holding Orsha and the main Moscow-Minsk highway. Despite a tenacious German defense, Orsha was liberated by 26 June, and the 3rd Belorussian Front&#x27;s mechanized forces were able to penetrate far into the German rear, reaching the Berezina River by 28 June.
The central sector of Soviet operations was against the long front of 4th Army, under the command of Kurt von Tippelskirch. Soviet plans envisaged the bulk of it, the XXXIX Panzer Corps and XII Corps, being encircled while pinned down by attacks from the 2nd Belorussian Front in the parallel Mogilev Offensive Operation. By far the most important Soviet objective, however, was the main Moscow–Minsk road and the town of Orsha, which the southern wing of Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s 3rd Belorussian Front was ordered to take. A breakthrough in this area, against General Paul Völckers&#x27; XXVII Corps, would form the northern pincer of the encirclement. The Minsk highway was protected by extensive defensive works manned by the 78th Assault Division, a specially reinforced unit with extra artillery and assault gun support. Orsha itself had been designated a &quot;Fester Platz&quot; (stronghold) under the 78th Division&#x27;s commander. 

The Soviet assault on this sector opened on 22 June with a massive artillery barrage that destroyed defensive positions, flattened bunkers, and detonated ammunition stores. Infantry from the 11th Guards Army, 5th Army and 31st Army then attacked the German positions, breaking through the first defensive belt on the same day. The German deployment of its only reserve division was met the next day with the insertion of the massed Soviet tank brigades, which achieved the operational breakthrough. By 25 June, Soviet forces began to advance into the German rear.
Völckers&#x27; position was further threatened by the near-collapse of the 3rd Panzer Army&#x27;s VI Corps, immediately to the north. By midnight on 25 June, the 11th Guards Army had shattered the remains of VI Corps, and 26 June saw the German forces in retreat. Soviet tank forces of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps were able to push up the road towards Minsk at speed, with a subsidiary force breaking off to encircle Orsha, which was liberated on the evening of 26 June. The main exploitation force, Pavel Rotmistrov&#x27;s 5th Guards Tank Army, was then committed through the gap in the German lines. VI Corps finally crumbled completely; its commander, General Georg Pfeiffer, was killed on 28 June after losing contact with his divisions. Achieving complete success, the operation effectively ceased with the arrival of 5th Guards Tank Army&#x27;s forward units at the Berezina River on 28 June.

===Mogilev offensive===

The centre of the 4th Army was holding the tip of the Byelorussian bulge, with the bulk of its forces on a shallow bridgehead east of the Dnieper River. The Mogilev Offensive opened with an intense artillery barrage against the German defensive lines on the morning of 22 June. The goal of the 2nd Belorussian Front (Colonel-General Gyorgy Zakharov) was to pin the 4th Army near Mogilev while the developing Vitebsk–Orsha and Bobruysk Offensives encircled it.

East of Mogilev, General Robert Martinek&#x27;s XXXIX Panzer Corps attempted to hold its lines in the face of an assault by the 49th Army during which the latter suffered heavy casualties. The 4th Army commander, Tippelskirch, requested that the army be allowed to withdraw on 25 June. When the permission was not forthcoming, he authorised his units to withdraw to the Dnieper; this was countermanded by the Army Group commander, Busch, who instructed Tippelskirch to order the units to return to their positions. This was however impossible as a cohesive frontline no longer existed. With the front collapsing, Busch met with Hitler on 26 June and received the authorisation to pull the army back to the Berezina River, west of Mogilev. The 49th Army forced the Dnieper crossings on the evening of 27 June and fought its way into the city during the night, while mobile units enveloped the garrison from the northwest.

During the day both the German XII Corps and XXXIX Panzer Corps began falling back towards the Berezina crossings. Travel was nearly impossible by day, due to the omnipresence of the Soviet air force, while Soviet tank columns and roadblocks provided constant obstacles. The main body of 4th Army arrived at the crossing on 30 June. It largely completed the crossing by 2 July, under heavy Soviet bombardment, but was retreating into a trap. The Mogilev Offensive fulfilled all its immediate objectives; not only was the city itself taken, but the 4th Army was successfully prevented from disengaging in time to escape encirclement in the Minsk Offensive, which commenced immediately afterwards.
===Bobruysk offensive===
To capture Bobruysk, General Konstantin Rokossovsky proposed during the planning of Operation Bagration a multi-pronged approach by seizing both Bobruysk and Slutsk and ultimately destroying the German 9th Army under Generalfeldmarschall Hans Jordan by attacking both fortress cities with equal priority and strength, with which the Soviet General Staff and Joseph Stalin himself had initially disagreed. However, Rokossovsky stubbornly insisted and promised Stalin that the operation would be a success.

According to Rokossovsky&#x27;s plan, the 1st Belorussian Front would be divided into two sectors - the Soviet 3rd Army under the command of General Alexander Gorbatov striking from Rogachev and the sector comprising the Soviet 10th, 28th and 65th Armies as well as the Cavalry-Mechanised Group(KMG) under the command of Lieutenant General Issa Pliyev mounting its assault from Parichi. The Rogachev sector would be supervised by Zhukov, while the group of forces in Parichi would be commanded by Konstantin Rokossovsky himself. A rivalry formed between the two most competent commanders of the Soviet Red Army as the two raced against each other towards Bobruysk.

On 24 June 1944, 7,000 guns, mortars and rocket launchers of the 1st Belorussian Front began firing on the troops of the German 9th Army, while ground-attack aircraft strafed and bombed the German columns as the Red Air Force firmly controlled the skies of the Belorussian balcony. Following the colossal bombardment, intended to shatter the forward defences of the 9th Army, troops of the Soviet 3rd Army launched their assault from Rogachev. They were met with obstinate resistance from the Germans in that sector and sustained heavy casualties, advancing little. Meanwhile, the sector under Konstantin Rokossovsky met much less retaliation, as the lines around Parichi were not heavily guarded by the German troops. The Cavalry-Mechanised Group (KMG) under the command of Lieutenant General Issa Pliev, consisting of the 4th Guards Cavalry Corps and the 1st Mechanised Corps, swept hastily across the edge of the Pripyet Marshes, subduing the German 9th Army troops defending &quot;Feste Plätz&quot; Slutsk, cutting through the fortress, effectively hindering the bulk of the 9th Army&#x27;s ability to flee through the south and ultimately sealing the fate of the unit. It was the ability of KMG Pliev to seize Slutsk and swing south against the 9th Army that truly showed the effectiveness of the combination of the anachronistic horse-mounted Soviet cavalrymen and the Soviet armoured formations in the form of the Cavalry-Mechanised Group in striking deep into the operational depth of the opponent, as envisaged by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s Deep Battle doctrine.

With the flanks secured by the Cavalry-Mechanised Group and the escape routes of the 9th Army severed, the Soviet 65th Army swung north and soon entered the fortress city of Bobruysk. Heavy fighting ensued, but the 65th Army was able to capture the stronghold by 29 June. The 9th Army was destroyed, unable to escape due to the fact that they had been cut off by the prior Soviet manoeuvres.

Due to the failures of the commander of Army Group Centre, Generalfeldmarschall Ernst Busch was forced to commit the 20th Panzer Division as a relief force to the 9th Army. Busch was sacked on the 28th by Adolf Hitler and replaced with the experienced master of defensive warfare, Walther Model.

The success of the Bobruysk Offensive was significant enough that Joseph Stalin began addressing Rokossovsky as Konstantin Konstantinovich as a sign of respect, a privilege that was only bestowed upon one other military officer, Boris Shaposhnikov. The vital victory at the crucial railway junction of Bobruysk also earned Konstantin Rokossovsky the title of the Marshal of the Soviet Red Army, bringing the position and reputation of the former Gulag prisoner along those of Zhukov and Ivan Konev.

==Second phase: strategic offensive against Army Group Centre==
The second phase of the operation involved the entire operation&#x27;s most significant single objective: the retaking of Minsk, capital of the Byelorussian SSR. It would also complete the large-scale encirclement and destruction, set up by the first phase, of much of Army Group Centre.

===Minsk offensive===
From 28 June, the main exploitation units of the 3rd Belorussian Front (the 5th Guards Tank Army and an attached cavalry-mechanised group) began to push on to secure crossings of the Berezina, followed by the 11th Guards Army. In the south, exploitation forces of the 1st Belorussian Front began to close the lower pincer of the trap developing around the German 4th Army.
The Germans brought back the 5th Panzer Division into Byelorussia to cover the approaches to Minsk, while the units of 4th Army began to withdraw over the Berezina crossings, where they were pounded by heavy air bombardment. After forcing crossings of the Berezina, Soviet forces closed in on Minsk. The 2nd Guards Tank Corps was the first to break into the city in the early hours of 3 July; fighting erupted in the centre, which was finally cleared of German rearguards by the following day. The 5th Guards Tank Army and 65th Army closed the encirclement to the west of Minsk, trapping the entire German 4th Army, and many of the remnants of the 9th Army.

Over the next few days, the pocket east of Minsk was reduced: only a fraction of the 100,000 soldiers in it escaped. Minsk had been liberated, and Army Group Centre destroyed, in what was possibly the Wehrmacht&#x27;s greatest defeat of the war. Between 22 June and 4 July 1944, Army Group Centre lost 25 divisions and 300,000 men. In the few subsequent weeks, the Germans lost another 100,000 men.

===Polotsk offensive===
The Polotsk offensive had the dual objective of taking Polotsk itself, and of screening the northern flank of the main Minsk Offensive against a possible German counter-offensive from Army Group North.

The 1st Baltic Front successfully pursued the retreating remnants of the 3rd Panzer Army back towards Polotsk, which was reached by 1 July. German forces attempted to organise a defense using rear-area support units and several divisions hurriedly transferred from Army Group North.

Units of the 1st Baltic Front&#x27;s 4th Shock Army and 6th Guards Army fought their way into the city over the next few days, and successfully cleared it of German forces by 4 July.

==Third phase: strategic offensive operations in the north==
As German resistance had almost completely collapsed, Soviet forces were ordered to push on as far as possible beyond the original objective of Minsk, and new objectives were issued by the Stavka. This resulted in a third phase of offensive operations, which should be regarded as a further part of Operation Bagration.

Model hoped to reestablish a defensive line running through Lida using what was left of the 3rd Panzer, 4th and 9th Armies along with new reinforcements.

===Šiauliai offensive===
The Šiauliai offensive covered the operations of the 1st Baltic Front between 5 and 31 July against the remnants of the 3rd Panzer Army. Its main objective was the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai (; ).

The 43rd, 51st, and 2nd Guards Armies attacked towards Riga on the Baltic coast with 3rd Guards Mechanised Corps attached. By 31 July, the coast on the Gulf of Riga had been reached. 6th Guards Army covered Riga and the extended flank of the penetration towards the north.

A hurriedly organised German counter-attack restored the severed connection between the remnants of Army Group Centre and Army Group North. In August, the Germans attempted to retake Šiauliai in Operation Doppelkopf and Operation Cäsar, but they failed.

===Vilnius offensive===

The Vilnius offensive was conducted by units of the 3rd Belorussian Front subsequent to their completion of the Minsk Offensive; they were opposed by the remnants of 3rd Panzer Army and the 4th Army.

Units of the 4th Army, principally the 5th Panzer Division, attempted to hold the key rail junction of Molodechno, but failed. It was taken by units of the 11th Guards Army, 5th Guards Tank Army and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps on 5 July. German forces continued a precipitate retreat, and Soviet forces reached Vilnius, held by units of the 3rd Panzer Army, by 7 July.

By 8 July, the city had been encircled, trapping the garrison, who were ordered to hold fast at all costs. Soviet forces then fought their way into the city in intense street-by-street fighting (alongside an Armia Krajowa uprising, Operation Ostra Brama). On 12 July, 6th Panzer Division counter-attacked and temporarily opened an escape corridor for the besieged troops, but the majority of them were lost when the city fell on 13 July (this phase of the operation is commonly known as the Battle of Vilnius). On 23 July, the 4th Army commander, Hoßbach, in agreement with Model, committed the newly arrived 19th Panzer Division into a counter-attack with the intention of cutting off the Soviet spearheads in the Augustow Forest. This failed.

===Belostok offensive===

The Belostok offensive covered the operations of 2nd Belorussian Front between 5 and 27 July, with the objective of the Polish city of Białystok (Belostok). The 40th and 41st Rifle Corps of 3rd Army, on the front&#x27;s left wing, took Białystok by storm on 27 July, after two days of fighting.

===Lublin–Brest offensive===
The Lublin–Brest offensive was carried out by Rokossovsky&#x27;s 1st Belorussian Front between 18 July and 2 August, and developed the initial gains of Operation Bagration toward eastern Poland and the Vistula. The 47th and 8th Guards Armies reached the Bug River by 21 July, and the latter reached the eastern bank of the Vistula by 25 July. Lublin was taken on 24 July; the 2nd Tank Army was ordered to turn north, towards Warsaw, to cut off the retreat of forces from Army Group Centre in the Brest area. Brest was taken on 28 July and the Front&#x27;s left wing seized bridgeheads over the Vistula by 2 August. This effectively completed the operation, the remainder of the summer being given over to defensive efforts against a series of German counter-attacks on the bridgeheads. The operation ended with the defeat of German Army Group North Ukraine and Soviet bridgeheads over the Vistula River west of Sandomierz.

===Kaunas offensive===
The Kaunas offensive covered the operations of Chernyakhovsky&#x27;s 3rd Belorussian Front from 28 July to 28 August, towards the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, subsequent to their completion of the offensive against Vilnius. By 30 July all Wehrmacht resistance on the approaches to the Neman River had retreated or been annihilated. Two days later the city of Kaunas was under Soviet control.

===Osovets offensive===
This offensive covered the operations of 2nd Belorussian Front from 6–14 August, after their completion of the Belostock Offensive, with the objective of the fortified area at Osowiec on one of the tributaries of the Narew River. The very large fortress complex there secured the approaches to East Prussia through the region&#x27;s marshes.

German forces were able to stabilise their line of defense along the Narew, which they held until the East Prussian offensive of January 1945.

==Aftermath==
This was by far the greatest Soviet victory in numerical terms. The Red Army recaptured a vast amount of Soviet territory and occupied some Baltic and Polish territories whose population had suffered greatly under the German occupation. The advancing Soviets found cities destroyed, villages depopulated, and much of the population killed or deported by the occupiers. To show the outside world the magnitude of the victory, some 57,000 German prisoners, taken from the encirclement east of Minsk, were paraded through Moscow: even marching quickly and twenty abreast, they took 90 minutes to pass. This was later known as the Parade of the Vanquished.

The German army never recovered from the materiel and manpower losses sustained during this time, having lost about a quarter of its Eastern Front manpower, exceeding even the percentage of loss at Stalingrad (about 17 full divisions). These losses included many experienced soldiers, NCOs and commissioned officers, which at this stage of the war the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; could not replace. According to German sources, Army Group Center suffered 27 divisions badly mauled; with 19 disbanded and 7 amalgamated to form just two divisions; losses were &quot;far worse&quot; than at Stalingrad, Tunis or Falaise.

An indication of the completeness of the Soviet victory is that 31 of the 47 German divisional or corps commanders involved were killed or captured. Of the German generals lost, nine were killed, including two corps commanders; 22 captured, including four corps commanders; Major-General Hans Hahne, commander of 197th Infantry Division disappeared on 24 June, while Lieutenant-Generals Zutavern and Philipp of the 18th Panzergrenadier and 134th Infantry Divisions died by suicide.
The near-total destruction of Army Group Centre was very costly for the Germans. Exact German losses are unknown but newer research indicates around 400,000–540,000 killed, missing or wounded. Soviet losses were also substantial, with 180,040 killed and missing, 590,848 wounded and sick, together with 2,957 tanks, 2,447 artillery pieces and 822 aircraft also lost. The offensive cut off Army Group North and Army Group North Ukraine from each other and weakened them as resources were diverted to the central sector. This forced both Army Groups to withdraw from Soviet territory much more quickly when faced with the following Soviet offensives in their sectors.

The end of Operation Bagration coincided with the destruction of many of the strongest units of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; engaged against the Allies on the Western Front in the Falaise Pocket in Normandy, during Operation Overlord. After these victories, supply problems rather than German resistance slowed the Allies&#x27; advance. The Germans transferred armoured units from the Italian front, where they could afford to give ground, to resist the Soviet advance near Warsaw.

This was one of the largest Soviet operations of WWII with 2.3 million troops engaged, three Axis armies eliminated and vast amounts of Soviet territory recaptured. In Soviet propaganda, this offensive was listed as one of Stalin&#x27;s ten blows.

<doc id="476587" wikidata="Q652792" url="?curid=476587" title="Mixco Viejo">
<text>Mixco Viejo () (&quot;Old Mixco&quot;), occasionally spelt Jilotepeque Viejo, is an archaeological site in the north east of the Chimaltenango department of Guatemala, some to the north of Guatemala City and from the junction of the rivers Pixcaya and Motagua. It is a moderate sized ruined city of the Postclassic Maya civilization.

The archaeological site and tourist attraction of Mixco Viejo was named after being erroneously associated with the Postclassic Poqomam capital referred to in colonial records by that name. The archaeological site has now been identified as Jilotepeque Viejo, the capital of the Chajoma kingdom. To distinguish between the two, the ruins of the Chajoma capital are now referred to as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) while the former Poqomam capital is referred to as Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo).

This confusion in the identification of the site has hindered study. The Chajoma capital has been investigated archaeologically, under the assumption that it was the Poqomam capital. Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically, the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely. Doubts about the identification of the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco.

Chinautla Viejo was attacked by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover the location of a cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.

Jilotepeque Viejo was settled by the Chajoma in order to provide a capital that was safer from attack from the hostile Iximche Kaqchikel kingdom than their previous capital. In spite of this, the city fell under the domination of Iximche and the city&#x27;s architecture, spread in a number of fortified groups along a ridge surrounded by deep ravines, shows a mixture of Chajoma and Kaqchikel styles. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Chajoma of Jilotepeque Viejo may have initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with Iximche and have joined in the general Kaqchikel uprising against the Spanish in 1524. The site was abandoned after the conquest and never reoccupied.

==Mixco Viejo in history: Chinautla Viejo==
The historical Mixco Viejo has been identified as Chinautla Viejo (&quot;Old Chinautla&quot;), near the modern town of Mixco. Mixco Viejo (&quot;Old Mixco&quot;) was the capital of the Poqomam Maya kingdom, and was founded on a defensive mountain-top location in the 12th century AD. The peak population in the early 16th century may have been around 10,000 people.

In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a small company to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), the capital of the Poqomam. At the Spanish approach, the inhabitants remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.

Armed with the knowledge gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.

==Archaeological site: Jilotepeque Viejo==

Although the site now known as Mixco Viejo was traditionally considered the Poqomam capital, recent investigations have instead identified the ruins as the capital of the Kaqchikel-speaking Chajoma Maya, and have suggested that its identification as the historical Mixco Viejo is the result of confusion in the interpretation of colonial records. The site was apparently known to the Chajoma by a variety of names, including &quot;Chuapec Kekacajol Nima Abaj&quot; (also spelt &quot;Chuwa Pek Q&#x27;eqak&#x27;ajol Nima Ab&#x27;aj&quot;), meaning &quot;Great stone in front of the Cave of the Children of Night&quot;, &quot;Zakicajol&quot; and &quot;Nimcakajpec&quot;. Jilotepeque Viejo is estimated to have had a population of approximately 1,500 inhabitants. Jilotepeque was close to the San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian source, giving the inhabitants ready access to the resource.

The site is open to the public and has a small museum. The site was declared a protected archaeological zone by Ministerial Accord 1210 of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education on 12 June 1970.

===Location===
The ruins are situated at the northeastern extreme of the department of Chimaltenango within the municipality of San Martín Jilotepeque; they are strung out over along a high ridge approximately from the point where the Pixcaya River flows into the Motagua River, which drains into the Caribbean Sea. The ruins are surrounded by deep ravines dropping off sharply into a tributary of the Pixcaya River. The site is from Guatemala City by road.

===History===

====Known rulers====
&quot;All dates are approximate.&quot;
====Postclassic====
Around 1450 the Chajoma, led by their king Lajuj No&#x27;j, moved to Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) from Ochal to make their capital more inaccessible to their hostile neighbours. In spite of this, Iximche defeated the Chajoma and Jilotepeque Viejo became subject to the Kaqchikel kingdom. Groups C and E show Kaqchikel influence in their architectural styles, while groups A and B have a purer Chajoma architectural style. Both ballcourts appear to have been remodelled after the Kaqchikel fashion, with thick coatings of stucco.

Around the 13th century, Group A underwent a major remodelling, including the construction of a new retaining wall and the infilling of the wide area between the old and new walls, creating a much expanded terrace for the construction of the group&#x27;s architecture. Owing to its possession of two ballcourts, it is possible that Jilotepeque Viejo served as a regional centre for the Mesoamerican ballgame during the Postclassic; no other Postclassic ballcourt has been identified in the area of San Martín Jilotepeque although three of four Classic period ballcourts at other sites appear to have continued in use. Shortly before the Spanish Conquest, the Chajoma under their lord Achi Q&#x27;alel rebelled against the Kaqchikels of Iximche.

It is possible that the Chajoma of Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with the Kaqchikel kingdom of Iximche, and that they also rebelled against the Spanish in 1524. It is known that when the lords of Iximche broke their alliance with the conquistadors, they took refuge in Jilotepeque. The site was abandoned after the Spanish conquest and the inhabitants were moved by the Spanish to San Martín Jilotepeque, after which the area was never reoccupied.

====Modern history====
German geographer Karl Sapper visited the ruins in 1896 and published a brief description of the ruins together with a site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the &quot;Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie&quot; of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled &quot;Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala&quot;. It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his &quot;Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America&quot;, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l&#x27;Homme of Paris under the direction of archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.

Although the site was restored during the archaeological investigations, it suffered considerable damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction of some of the restoration work, although some of the damage has now been repaired.

===Site description===

The ruins consist of 15 groups containing the remains of over 120 major structures, including temples, palaces, and courts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. When the site was excavated, the surface was found to be littered with abundant obsidian blades and arrowheads. Originally the city had its main entrance on the western side, a modern road has now been cut through to the ruins from the west along a similar route.

The relatively short period of occupation at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) led to an unusual unity of architectural styles for a Mesoamerican city. Almost all archaeological finds at the city, including both artefacts and earlier versions of later structures, date to the last few hundred years before the Spanish conquest. The architecture was built with mica and pumice slabs, in some cases this was coated with stucco. Stone sculpture is almost totally absent from the city, the only example being a ballcourt marker in the form of a serpent&#x27;s head with jaws agape and a human head emerging from its mouth. Originally some buildings were decorated with painted stucco but this is so poorly preserved that only a few fragments remain.

A population estimate derived from the number of residential remains suggests that the city had approximately 1450 to 1600 inhabitants.

====Architectural groups====
The architecture is divided into a number of groups and subgroups, labelled by archaeologists as Groups A through to L; those subgroups belonging to Groups A, B, C and E that fall outside the city walls are indicated with the addition of an X or an apostrophe after the group name, to give Group A-X, Group B-X, Group C&#x27; and Group E&#x27;.

=====Group A=====

Group A is located on the northern end of the ridge. The group was extended during major remodelling work that included the building of the final versions of Platforms A2 and A3 on the north side; this involved building a new retaining wall some further north, east and southeast and filling in the area between the new and old walls to create a greatly expanded terrace. Traces of charcoal at the base of the old retaining wall have been radiocarbon dated to the 13th century, indicating that the expansion of Group A took place no earlier than that.

Pyramid A1 is one of the principal structures of Group A, together with the ballcourt. The pyramid is high and measures at the base. It was built using cut stone and has four stepped levels, each of which terminates in a cornice. The pyramid faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways with 27 steps each. The stairways are flanked by smooth balustrades built from well-fitted slabs. The summit of the pyramid supports a high platform that once formed the base for the summit temple. The pyramid was built over another structure, a stucco platform with two levels, the upper of which terminated in a cornice.

Platform A2 is built along the edge of the retaining wall behind Pyramid A1. It faces west towards the pyramid and has two access stairways. Three successive versions of the platform were built, each overlying the previous. The earliest version sat upon the early retaining wall, as did the second version. The final version was much larger and was built after the new retaining wall had extended the available area for Group A.

Platform A3 encloses the north side of the eastern part of the Group A plaza. It faces south onto the plaza and was accessed via two stairways on that side. The platform was built over an earlier structure that was built on top of an early tiered retaining wall; the earlier structure extended above the retaining wall. The final version extended further to the west and further to the north. It had two levels, each terminating in a cornice. On the north side a wide bench extends along the base of the wall.

Platform A4 divides the Group A plaza in two. It was a later addition to Group A during the reorganisation of the group that involved the destruction of the earlier building under Platform A5. When excavated it was very poorly reserved but was able to be reliably restored. There was no earlier version of the structure; it consists of a platform with two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A. The upper level is topped with a cornice and access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades.

Platform A5 closes the north side of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels upon a base and a cornice terminating the walls. The platform faces south towards the plaza and ballcourt. The platform was accessed via four stairways, each with nine steps; they were flanked by steep ramps or balustrades. The visible version of Platform A5 covers the remains of an earlier structure. The earlier building was a large platform with a north-south orientation as opposed to the east-west orientation of Platform A5. The surviving parts were investigated by archaeologists and consist of the north wall and parts of the west facade. The north wall was wide, suggesting that the earlier platform was very large and probably extended south almost as far as the ballcourt. Two funerary urns were excavated from the earlier platform.
Platform A6 encloses the western extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper of which has a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older version of the same building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.

Structure A7 is a small square altar in the middle of the eastern part of the Group A plaza. It faces west with steps on that side.

Platform A8 is to the east of Pyramid A1, on the eastern side of the Group A plaza. It faces northwest towards the pyramid and had two access stairways. Behind the platform was a finely paved terrace extending along the edge of the retaining wall.

Platform A9 is to the east of the ballcourt (A11) and faces towards it. It had four access stairways set between corniced balustrades; each stairway had nine steps.

Ballcourt A11 encloses the west side of the Group A plaza, separating it from the retaining wall dropping off to the ravine behind the ballcourt. It is a sunken ballcourt with a north-south orientation and is entirely enclosed. A short sunken stairway leads from the plaza to the top of the south wall. Another stairway descends the south wall to the southern end zone of the ballcourt. A matching stairway in the northern end zone provides access from that direction. The interior of the ballcourt playing area measures north-south and the playing alley is wide between the side benches. The walls were built of small stone slabs and have a slight slope; as is common with the architecture of Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo), the walls were topped with vertical cornices. However, the end zone walls are all completely vertical. Fragments of stucco recovered around the ballcourt indicate that it was at least partly coated.

Structure A12 was a residential structure on the southwest side of the Group A plaza between the ballcourt and Platform A6. All that remains of this structure is its outline marked in stones.

Structure A14 was a residential structure immediately northeast of Platform A5.

Structures A31 and A32 were residential structures near platform A5 on the north side of the Group A plaza.

=====Group A-X=====
Group A-X defines a number of structures in two subgroups lying outside the walls of Group A, to the northeast and northwest of the main group.

=====Group B=====

Group B is near the centre of the site, roughly equidistant between Group A (to the northeast) and Group C (to the southwest). The main plaza of Group B was at the northern end of the group and was enclosed by the ballcourt on the south side, a double pyramid on the east side and three platforms. A stairway with 28 steps descends the Group B retaining wall behind the northeast corner of the double pyramid, providing an access route towards Group D. On the north side of the group another stairway, with 18 steps divided into two flights, descends towards Group A.

Ballcourt B1 is immediately south of the Group B plaza, with the northern entrance to the ballcourt directly accessing the plaza itself. It is an enclosed sunken ballcourt, as was common in the Maya highlands during the Late Postclassic. The ballcourt is aligned north-south with two transverse end zones forming a capital I shape. The ballcourt has two entrances in the form of inset stairways in the end zones, in the centre of the ballcourt&#x27;s north and south walls. The side walls of the playing alley are slightly sloped and are topped by a cornice; the playing alley is flanked by two low benches set against the east and west walls. The end zones also possess sloping walls. All the ballcourt walls were built of large stones. The ballcourt playing area measures north-south and is wide between the benches. The end zones measure east-west. The ballcourt was originally coated in stucco painted in a variety of colours; very little of this coating now remains. A drain opening empties runoff rainwater from the east side of the northern end zone; the drain continues under Platform B 2 and empties outside the retaining wall of Group B.
During archaeological investigation of the ballcourt a well-preserved tenoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by a hole in the upper part of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.
Platform B2 is aligned northeast to southwest and faces northwest onto the Group B plaza. It had two access stairways flanked by steep balustrades topped with vertical cornices. Behind the platform two stairways descend Group B&#x27;s retaining wall towards Group B-X.

Pyramid B3 is actually two pyramids built upon a single basal platform. Together they comprise the most important architectural unit in Group B. The northern pyramid of the pair is denominated B3a; the southern is B3b. The two pyramids each have five stepped levels and face west onto the plaza. Each pyramid was accessed by a single stairway flanked by wide balustrades; each had a small altar at the base of its stairway. Both stairways had nineteen steps and the pyramids stand high. Low platforms on their summits indicate where the temple buildings once stood. The double form of the twin pyramids had its origin in the Valley of Mexico and indicates foreign influences at the city. A broken stela was excavated from within the fill of Pyramid B3a; it was a plain monument broken in two parts. The bottom section still stood, while the upper section was lying beside it. It is one of very few such monuments raised in the Maya highlands and such stelae are characteristic of the Classic Period (c. 250–900). It is possible that it stands where originally erected before the pyramid was built over it. A funerary urn was excavated from underneath the rear of Pyramid B3b.

A drain near the northeast corner of Pyramid B3 carries runoff rainwater from the Group B plaza and channels it outside the retaining wall to the area between Groups B and D.
Platform B4 encloses the north side of the Group B plaza. The platform consists of a single level set upon a base and possesses corniced walls. Access was via an inset stairway in the centre of the south side. The platform top was floored with slabs and possessed a low double terrace at the rear.

Platform B5 possesses two stepped levels with cornices and encloses the northern part of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the back wall because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.

Pyramid B6 enclosed the southern portion of the west side of the Group B plaza. It is very poorly preserved and the top of the pyramid has collapsed, leaving only the lower walls. Archaeological investigation revealed that the final version of the pyramid had been built over a preceding version.

Structure B7 was a small, well-proportioned rectangular structure south of the main Group A plaza, between the north end of the ballcourt (B1) to the east and Structure B9 to the west. This structure was likely to have been an altar shrine.

Platform B8 is a range structure on the west side of Group B. It consists of a basal platform supporting inward-sloping walls that terminate in a cornice. The building faces east and possesses four access stairways separated by near-vertical balustrades. The retaining wall of Group B drops away into the neighbouring ravine behind Platform B8. A great number of funerary urns were excavated around the base of this platform.

=====Group B-X=====

Group B-X includes a number of structures in three subgroups outside the walls of Group B; they are to the northwest, northeast and east of Group B itself.

Structure B-X3 is a step pyramid with sides so steep that it is almost cubic in shape. This temple platform would originally have supported a perishable superstructure but no trace of this now remains. The pyramid faces west and was accessed by an extremely steep stairway with fifteen steps that faces directly onto the massive high retaining wall of Group B. The stairway is flanked by wide balustrades that form the western facade of the temple platform. Structure B-X3 has been restored.

Structure B-X4 has also been restored. It is a south-facing range structure with four inset access stairways.

=====Group C=====
Group C lies to the southwest of Group B and east of Group E. Group C is arranged around two large structures (C1 and C2). It possesses two small plazas; the East Plaza is the larger of the two, enclosing an area to the east of the main temple, Pyramid C1. The East Plaza was accessed via a narrow alley that ran between a large, low platform and a high-status residential structure with a patio (C8). An inset stairway climbed outside of the retaining wall of Group C and accessed the East Plaza between the high-status residence and a platform to its east. The West Plaza is located behind Platform C2 and is enclosed to the north by three platforms (C9, C10 and C17).
Pyramid C1 is the principal structure in Group C. Archaeological investigation uncovered three versions of the pyramid, each built over the last. The archaeologists restored the pyramid in such a way as to make a part of each of the three construction phases visible. The first phase of construction consisted of a platform of cut pumice blocks. This was buried under the second construction phase, which consisted of a five-level stepped pyramid. It had a double stairway on the west side; each stairway had 16 steps. The stairways were flanked and separated by ramps that terminated in sizeable masonry blocks at the top. The top of the pyramid stood high and was topped by a temple, parts of which survive and have been restored. The walls were built from packed earth coated with stucco; a section of the northern portion of the rear wall still stands to a height of . A wide stucco bench was built against the rear wall and a concave hollow in the floor was probably designed for the burning of incense. The roof of the temple was likely to have been thatched. The third and final construction phase was considerably larger than the preceding versions of the pyramid. In its final form the pyramid base measured ; it had five corniced levels and only possessed a single stairway in place of the earlier two. The stairway was flanked by two wide ramps, only the lower portion of the stairway and ramps survive. The top of the pyramid stood almost higher than the preceding version and preserved parts of the earlier temple building in its infill; the upper platform has largely collapsed and no trace remains of the final version of the temple superstructure. Both the second and third versions of the pyramid were originally coated in stucco, parts of which were preserved. New stucco was applied during restoration work to match the original coating. Although the pyramid was restored after it was excavated, the 1976 Guatemala earthquake caused considerable damage and the upper portion of the pyramid was reduced to rubble.

A burial was excavated from in front of the wall of the earliest version of the pyramid. The associated offerings included a number of clay vessels, a necklace of small gold bells and a copper axe. The earliest metal artefacts in the Maya region have been dated to the Terminal Classic period (c.800-900); the presence of metal artefacts associated with the earliest construction phase at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) demonstrates the short span of the site and suggests that all three construction phases succeeded each other relatively rapidly. Further ceramic offerings were deposited under both of the latter two phases and an artificially deformed skull was interred under the central axis of the final version.

Platform C2 faces Pyramid C1 and borders the Group C Plaza. The platform is a long rectangular structure measuring (north-south by east-west) and occupies the highest location of any structure at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The platform has two levels and has a total height of , the lower of which has a prominent cornice. The east side of the lower level has an inset stairway accessing the upper level. The upper level of the platform is recessed against the rear of the lower level and possesses an elaborate facade with four access stairways separated by corniced ramps. The entire platform was originally coated in stucco, of which only a few traces remain. On the upper level the stucco traces outline where walls once stood, leading archaeologists to conclude that several residential structures once stood on top. Platform C2 was built upon an earlier, shorter platform that possessed a facade composed of thin slabs. It is likely that Platform C2 provided restricted access to Pyramid C1. A number of funerary urns were excavated from the base of Platform C2.

Structure C6 was an observation platform that formed the south side of the East Plaza. It faced out southwards across the neighbouring valley.

Platform C7 is an L-shaped platform that closes the east side and northeast corner of the East Plaza. Steps run the entire length of the platform.
Structure C8 is a residential compound that was accessed from the alley running to the East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building in the whole of the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city&#x27;s elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.

Structure C11 was a small pyramid temple in the lower (western) section of Group C. It was built from small slabs of stone and faced west with an access stairway flanked by ramps. The structure overlies an earlier version that was built using pumice.

Structure C12 is a south-facing platform built from pumice. It divides the West Plaza in two. The upper surface of the platform is marked by a circle of burnt clay formed by the burning of incense.

Structure C13 is a platform closing the southern half of the west side of the West Plaza.

Structure C14 is a platform in the lower part of Group C, close to Pyramid C11.

=====Group C&#x27;=====
Group C&#x27; is a small group east of Group C; it is immediately south of Group B and adjoins it.

Structure C&#x27;1 is an unexcavated mound.

Structure C&#x27;2 is another unexcavated mound; it is smaller than Structure C&#x27;1.

=====Group D=====

Group D is a dispersed group to the east of Group B.

Pyramid D1 is on the east side of the Group D plaza. The pyramid had three stepped levels erected upon a low base. It faces west towards the plaza and had a single access stairway flanked by sloping balustrades that terminate in vertical sections at the upper extremes. The pyramid was of fine workmanship using well-cut stone slabs. However, itw was poorly preserved and the southern part had partially collapsed. The surviving portions of the building allowed it to be accurately restored by archaeologists.

Platform D2 is on the north side of the Group D plaza; it has not been investigated by archaeologists.

Platform D3 is on the south side of the Group D plaza and has not been subject to archaeological investigation.

Structure D4 is a small altar in the centre of the Group D plaza.

Platform D5 is a south-facing range structure of great length with just two access stairways. Excavations uncovered a number of funerary urns deposited under the back wall of the structure, the only example burial urns being interred behind such a platform.

=====Group E=====

Group E is located to the west of Group C. Group E is largely surrounded by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs to make them steeper and more defensible, and reinforced them with a retaining wall. Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the retaining wall to Group E.

Pyramid E1 is located on the east side of the Group E plaza and was the most important building in Group E. The pyramid had three construction phases, the oldest of which was built from pumice upon a natural high elevation and was found to be well preserved during excavations of the site. This early phase was packed with rounded pebbles to provide the infill for the second phase of construction. The second version of the pyramid was very poorly preserved; excavations uncovered many stucco fragments but were unable to determine which of the first two construction phases they belonged to. The third and final phase of construction was larger than the preceding versions of the building and encased both them and the natural elevation upon which they stood. The pyramid had four stepped levels upon a basal platform. It faced west with an access stairway flanked by two ramps that terminated in projecting masonry blocks at the top. A small altar was excavated at the base of the pyramid; two stones were found placed upon it. One of these stones was ball-shaped while the other was perforated and may have been a mace or club. A number of funerary urns were excavated at the base of the southern side of the pyramid.

Structure E2 is a range structure on the north side of the Group E plaza. It has not been subject to archaeological investigation.

Structure E3 is a square altar in the middle of the Group E plaza. It faces towards Pyramid E1.

Structure E4 is a platform located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses the eastern side of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform&#x27;s base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.

Platform E6 is situated on the west side of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.

=====Other groups=====
Group E&#x27; is a cluster of small buildings in the trough between the hilltops supporting Groups C and E.

Group F is to the west of Group E. Mound F is the main structure within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.

Group G consists of a number of small structures strung out along the ridge to the north of Group A.

Group H is a small group to the northeast of Group A. Structure H1 is a platform that uses a natural mound as its base.

Group I is also known as the Campana Group. It is the northernmost group at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo).

Group J is a cluster of small buildings immediately southwest of Group A and adjoining it.

====Caves====
Three small caves are found in the sides of the ridge supporting the ruins of the city; archaeological investigations have revealed that two of these caves were artificially modified in antiquity.

Cueva de La Lola (&quot;Lola&#x27;s Cave&quot;) is situated below Group A, near the bank of the Pancaco River as it flows to the northwest of the ruins. The cave is deep and wide; for most of its length it is high. The cave had been artificially widened and heightened. During the rain season rainwater filtering through the ground below the city flows out as a small waterfall at the bottom of the cave. The cave was used for ceremonial activities, related to the presence of the spring within it and the fact that the walls are formed from green phyllite; greenstone was sacred to the Maya and was associated with water and fertility. Ritual activities in the cave have continued into modern times, with ceremonial fires being lit within.

Cueva del Murciélago (&quot;Cave of the Bat&quot;) is located at the southern extreme of the site. It is deep; at its widest point it is wide and the cave is high. It was artificially widened to permit access and was still used for Maya ceremonies in the late 20th century, when archaeologists found recent evidence of activity.

===Funerary offerings===
A large quantity of funerary urns have been excavated from the bases of buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs in the form of highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.

A total of 52 urns were excavated from the ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo; 8 of these were destroyed by the 1976 earthquake leaving 44 available for study. Twelve of these were in the collection of the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris for approximately thirty years; These urns, together with all other artefacts from Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo), were repatriated to Guatemala in 1998. Each urn contained the cremated remains of a single adult. All of these appeared to be mature or elderly adults; the remains of young adults were notably absent, indicating that elite warriors were buried in some other manner. The urns themselves represented a variety of highland ceramic types. Analysis of bone fragments in the cremated remains indicates that the entire body was burnt without any special treatment for the skull, although the offering of a skull was excavated from Pyramid C1. Surviving skull fragments indicated the practice of artificial skull deformation among the elite inhabitants of the city. The remains of animal bones were found mixed among a significant portion of the contents of the urns; where identifiable these included deer bones and those of a number of bird species, particularly parrots and birds of prey.

Only six of the urns contained associated funerary offerings:

<text>In financial accounting, a cash flow statement, also known as statement of cash flows, is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities. Essentially, the cash flow statement is concerned with the flow of cash in and out of the business. As an analytical tool, the statement of cash flows is useful in determining the short-term viability of a company, particularly its ability to pay bills. International Accounting Standard 7 (IAS 7) is the International Accounting Standard that deals with cash flow statements.

People and groups interested in cash flow statements include:
* Accounting personnel, who need to know whether the organization will be able to cover payroll and other immediate expenses
* Potential lenders or creditors, who want a clear picture of a company&#x27;s ability to repay
* Potential investors, who need to judge whether the company is financially sound
* Potential employees or contractors, who need to know whether the company will be able to afford compensation
*Company Directors, who are responsible for the governance of the company, and are responsible for ensuring that the company does not trade while insolvent
* Shareholders of the company.

==Purpose==

The cash flow statement shows the sources of a company&#x27;s cash flow and how it was used over a specific time period. It is an important indicator of a company&#x27;s financial health, because a company can report a profit on its income statement, but at the same time have insufficient cash to operate. The cash flow statement reveals the quality of a company&#x27;s earnings (i.e. how much came from cash flow as opposed to accounting treatment), and the firm&#x27;s capacity to pay interest and dividends.

The cash flow statement differs from the balance sheet and income statement in that it excludes non-cash transactions required by accrual basis accounting, such as depreciation, deferred income taxes, write-offs on bad debts and sales on credit where receivables have not yet been collected.

The cash flow statement is intended to:
# provide information on a firm&#x27;s liquidity, solvency and financial flexibility (the ability to change cash flows in future circumstances)
# help predict future cash flows and borrowing needs
# improve the comparability of different firms&#x27; operating performance by eliminating the effects of different accounting methods. The cash flow statement has been adopted as a standard financial statement because it eliminates allocations, which might be derived from different accounting methods, such as various timeframes for depreciating fixed assets.

==History and variations==
Cash basis financial statements were very common before accrual basis financial statements. The &quot;flow of funds&quot; statements of the past were cash flow statements.

In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had recovered from a business slump, but had no cash to invest for a new blast furnace, despite having made a profit. To explain why there were no funds to invest, the manager made a new financial statement that was called a &quot;comparison balance sheet&quot;, which showed that the company was holding too much inventory. This new financial statement was the genesis of the cash flow statement that is used today.

In the United States in 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) defined rules that made it mandatory under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) to report sources and uses of funds, but the definition of &quot;funds&quot; was not clear. Net working capital might be cash or might be the difference between current assets and current liabilities. From the late 1970 to the mid-1980s, the FASB discussed the usefulness of predicting future cash flows. In 1987, FASB Statement No. 95 (FAS 95) mandated that firms provide cash flow statements. In 1992, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued
International Accounting Standard 7 (IAS 7), &quot;Cash Flow Statement&quot;, which became effective in 1994, mandating that firms provide cash flow statements.

US GAAP and IAS 7 rules for cash flow statements are similar, but some of the differences are:
* IAS 7 requires that the cash flow statement include changes in both cash and cash equivalents. US GAAP permits using cash alone or cash and cash equivalents.
* IAS 7 permits bank borrowings (overdraft) in certain countries to be included in cash equivalents rather than being considered a part of financing activities.
* IAS 7 allows interest paid to be included in operating activities or financing activities. US GAAP requires that interest paid be included in operating activities.
* US GAAP (FAS 95) requires that when the direct method is used to present the operating activities of the cash flow statement, a supplemental schedule must also present a cash flow statement using the indirect method. The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) strongly recommends the direct method but allows either method. The IASC considers the indirect method less clear to users of financial statements. Cash flow statements are most commonly prepared using the indirect method, which is not especially useful in projecting future cash flows.

==Cash flow activities==
International Accounting Standard 3 specifies the cash flows and adjustments to be included under each of the major activity categories. 

===Operating activities===
Operating activities include the production, sales and delivery of the company&#x27;s product as well as collecting payment from its customers. This could include purchasing raw materials, building inventory, advertising, and shipping the product.

Operating cash flows include:
* Receipts for the sale of loans, debt or equity instruments in a trading portfolio
* Interest received on loans
* Payments to suppliers for goods and services
* Payments to employees or on behalf of employees
* Interest payments (alternatively, this can be reported under financing activities in IAS 3)
* Purchases of merchandise 

Items which are added back to (or subtracted from, as appropriate) net income (which is found on the Income Statement) to arrive at cash flows from operations generally include:
* Depreciation (loss of tangible asset value over time)
* Deferred tax
* Amortization (loss of intangible asset value over time)
* Any gains or losses associated with the sale of a non-current asset, because associated cash flows do not belong in the operating section (unrealized gains/losses are also added back from the income statement)
*Dividends received general reserves

===Investing activities===
Examples of investing activities are:
* Purchase or sale of an asset
* Loans made to suppliers 
* Payments related to mergers and acquisitions

===Financing activities===
Financing activities include inflows and outflows of cash between investors and the company, such as:
* Dividends paid
* Sale or repurchase of the company&#x27;s stock
* Net borrowings
* Repayment of debt principal, including capital leases
* Other activities which impact the company&#x27;s long-term liabilities and equity

==Disclosure of non-cash activities==
Under IAS 7, non-cash investing and financing activities are disclosed in footnotes to the financial statements. Under US General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), non-cash activities may be disclosed in a footnote or within the cash flow statement itself. Non-cash financing activities may include:
* Leasing to purchase an asset
* Converting debt to equity
* Exchanging non-cash assets or liabilities for other non-cash assets or liabilities
* Issuing share
* Payment of dividend taxes in exchange for assets

==Preparation methods==
The direct method of preparing a cash flow statement results in a more easily understood report. The indirect method is almost universally used, because FAS 95 requires a supplementary report similar to the indirect method if a company chooses to use the direct method.

===Direct method===
The direct method for creating a cash flow statement reports major classes of gross cash receipts and payments. Under IAS 7, dividends received may be reported under operating activities or under investing activities. If taxes paid are directly linked to operating activities, they are reported under operating activities; if the taxes are directly linked to investing activities or financing activities, they are reported under investing or financing activities. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) vary from International Financial Reporting Standards in that under GAAP rules, dividends received from a company&#x27;s investing activities is reported as an &quot;operating activity,&quot; not an &quot;investing activity.&quot;

Sample cash flow statement using the direct method
===Indirect method===
The indirect method uses net-income as a starting point, makes adjustments for all transactions for non-cash items, then adjusts from all cash-based transactions. An increase in an asset account is subtracted from net income, and an increase in a liability account is added back to net income. This method converts accrual-basis net income (or loss) into cash flow by using a series of additions and deductions.

====Rules (operating activities)====

The following rules can be followed to calculate Cash Flows from Operating Activities when given only a two-year comparative balance sheet and the Net Income figure. Cash Flows from Operating Activities can be found by adjusting Net Income relative to the change in beginning and ending balances of Current Assets, Current Liabilities, and sometimes Long Term Assets. When comparing the change in long term assets over a year, the accountant must be certain that these changes were caused entirely by their devaluation rather than purchases or sales (i.e. they must be operating items not providing or using cash) or if they are non-operating items.
*Decrease in non-cash current assets are added to net income
*Increase in non-cash current asset are subtracted from net income
*Increase in current liabilities are added to net income
*Decrease in current liabilities are subtracted from net income
*Expenses with no cash outflows are added back to net income (depreciation and/or amortization expense are the only operating items that have no effect on cash flows in the period)
*Revenues with no cash inflows are subtracted from net income
*Non operating losses are added back to net income
*Non operating gains are subtracted from net income

The intricacies of this procedure might be seen as,

formula_1

For example, consider a company that has a net income of $100 this year, and its A/R increased by $25 since the beginning of the year. If the balances of all other current assets, long term assets and current liabilities did not change over the year, the cash flows could be determined by the rules above as $100 – $25 = Cash Flows from Operating Activities = $75. The logic is that, if the company made $100 that year (net income), and they are using the accrual accounting system (not cash based) then any income they generated that year which has not yet been paid for in cash should be subtracted from the net income figure in order to find cash flows from operating activities. And the increase in A/R meant that $25 of sales occurred on credit and have not yet been paid for in cash.

In the case of finding Cash Flows when there is a change in a fixed asset account, say the Buildings and Equipment account decreases, the change is added back to Net Income. The reasoning behind this is that because Net Income is calculated by, Net Income = Rev - Cogs - Depreciation Exp - Other Exp then the Net Income figure will be decreased by the building&#x27;s depreciation that year. This depreciation is not associated with an exchange of cash, therefore the depreciation is added back into net income to remove the non-cash activity.

====Rules (financing activities)====
Finding the Cash Flows from Financing Activities is much more intuitive and needs little explanation. Generally, the things to account for are financing activities:
*Include as outflows, reductions of long term notes payable (as would represent the cash repayment of debt on the balance sheet)
*Or as inflows, the issuance of new notes payable
*Include as outflows, all dividends paid by the entity to outside parties
*Or as inflows, dividend payments received from outside parties
*Include as outflows, the purchase of notes stocks or bonds
*Or as inflows, the receipt of payments on such financing vehicles.
In the case of more advanced accounting situations, such as when dealing with subsidiaries, the accountant must
*Exclude intra-company dividend payments.
*Exclude intra-company bond interest.
A traditional equation for this might look something like,

<doc id="476591" wikidata="Q14413567" url="?curid=476591" title="Corpus spongiosum (penis)">
<text>The corpus spongiosum is the mass of spongy tissue surrounding the male urethra within the penis. It is also called the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts.

== Structure ==
The proximal part of the corpus spongiosum is expanded to form the urethral bulb, and lies in apposition with the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, from which it receives a fibrous investment.

The urethra enters the bulb nearer to the superior than to the inferior surface. On the latter there is a median sulcus (groove), from which a thin fibrous septum (wall) projects into the substance of the bulb and divides it imperfectly into two lateral lobes or hemispheres.
The portion of the corpus spongiosum in front of the bulb lies in a groove on the under surface of the conjoined corpora cavernosa penis. It is cylindrical in form and tapers slightly from behind forward. Its anterior end is expanded in the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downward. This expansion, termed the glans penis, is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpus cavernosum penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces.

At the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical opening known as the external urethral orifice, or the urinary meatus.

The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona of glans penis, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis.

==Function==
The function of the corpus spongiosum in erection is to prevent the urethra from pinching closed, thereby maintaining the urethra as a viable channel for ejaculation. To do this, the corpus spongiosum remains pliable during erection while the corpora cavernosa penis become engorged with blood.

<doc id="476592" wikidata="Q1472347" url="?curid=476592" title="Southern Illinois University Carbondale">
<text>Southern Illinois University (SIU) is a public research university in Carbondale, Illinois, United States. Chartered in 1869, SIU is the oldest and flagship campus of the Southern Illinois University system. SIU enrolls students from all 50 states and more than 100 countries. Originally founded as a normal college, the university today provides programs in a variety of disciplines, combining a strong liberal arts tradition with a focus on research. SIU was granted limited university status in 1943 and began offering graduate degrees in 1950. A separate campus was established in Edwardsville, Illinois in 1957, eventually becoming Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – very High research activity&quot;. It is also known for its research partnerships, including those with the Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and NASA. The university is home to hundreds of student organizations, twenty-seven fraternity and sorority chapters, and a nationally-recognized competitive flight team. SIU&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are collectively known as the Southern Illinois Salukis.

==History==
Southern Illinois Normal College was chartered by an act of the Twenty-Sixth Illinois General Assembly on March 9, 1869, the second state-supported normal school to be created in Illinois. Carbondale was selected to host the university and a cornerstone-laying ceremony was held on May 17, 1870. Alternate sites considered for the university included Centralia and DuQuoin, among others. The accidental death of a site contractor and other delays prevented the university&#x27;s opening until 1874. The first session of the university was a summer institute with eight faculty members and an enrollment of 53 students.

In 1876 SIU admitted its first African-American student, Alexander Lane. In 1878 SIU established a program for the Douglas Corps Cadets, beginning a relationship with ROTC programs which lasts into the present day. The original &quot;Old Main&quot; building was destroyed by fire in 1883, and a new one was built in the same spot. The university&#x27;s first student newspaper, &quot;The Normal Gazette&quot;, was published in 1888 and its first yearbook, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sphinx&quot;, in 1899. SIU&#x27;s first sports teams, known as &quot;the Maroons&quot;, formed in the 1913-1914 school year.

The Shryock Auditorium was completed in 1918 and dedicated by former U.S. President Taft with a speech in support of the on-going war effort. Post-war prosperity aided the university&#x27;s growth, and by 1922 it enrolled over 1,000 students. Stagnation occurred with the onset of the Great Depression and the sudden deaths of university presidents Henry Shryock and Roscoe Pulliam. In 1943 SIU was granted limited university status to offer graduate degrees, and in 1947 the Illinois General Assembly officially adopted the name Southern Illinois University. Budget concerns and leadership challenges dogged the presidency of Chester F. Lay, Pulliam&#x27;s successor, until his resignation in 1948. In that same year, the first formal research conducted at SIU began with Lay&#x27;s appointment of geneticist Carl C. Lindegren.

Delyte W. Morris was inaugurated as SIU&#x27;s president in 1949. Morris was SIU&#x27;s longest-serving president, his 22-year tenure seeing the expansion and transformation of the university. New educational programs, administrative positions, and physical facilities were added, financed by a growth in student population and state-supported bonds. Housing and other amenities for students received particular focus. In 1957 a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville, near St. Louis. This school would develop into Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, now a public university within the SIU system.

President Morris left office in 1970. Formal explanations focused on Morris&#x27; declining health, but campus unrest due to the Vietnam War, the burning of the Old Main Building in 1969, financial scandals, and distrust amongst SIU&#x27;s Board of Trustees are speculated to have played a role. The university continued to grow with the creation of law, medical, and dental schools in the early 1970s. Other achievements included the opening of the long-awaited recreation center in 1977, the foundation of Project Achieve by Barbara Kupiec in 1978, and the Saluki men&#x27;s football team NCAA I-AA national football championship title win in 1983.

SIU&#x27;s enrollment reached a record enrollment of 24,869 students in 1991, a time when SIU became notorious for its party school reputation. Tensions with the surrounding community resulted in a ban on Halloween celebrations in the mid-1990s as students living in university dormitories were sent home for the holiday. Funding issues stemming from Illinois&#x27; state budget crises, including the 2015-2017 budget impasse, and declining student enrollment exacerbated a situation made worse by the unexpected deaths of university presidents Paul Sarvela and Carlo Montemagno. In recent years, a focus on research, building renovations and expansions, and stabilizing enrollment numbers have improved the university&#x27;s position. Student celebrations like the ones seen in Saturday Night Live&#x27;s &quot;Roadshow&quot; have now largely been replaced with the traditions of &quot;Unofficial Halloween&quot; and &quot;Polar Bear&quot;. Despite this, SIU was still named ninth in a list of &quot;The Top 10 Schools that Party All Day, Everyday&quot; by College Magazine in 2015.

==Campus==
At the time of SIU&#x27;s first class in 1874, the university consisted of one three-story building constructed between 1870 and 1874. Many of the university&#x27;s first buildings were constructed as the university expanded throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. Major additions were built during the 1960-70s and the 2000-10s. The age of the university is reflected in the various architectural styles on display, including examples of Victorian and Brutalist designs. In addition to its physical facilities, the campus boasts several areas of natural beauty, including Thompson Woods and Campus Lake. Various memorials, monuments, artistic structures, and other sites of interest are also present throughout the campus.

===Student amenities===

SIU offers a number of modern amenities for the benefit of its students. These include the Student Services Building, the Student Center, Morris Library, the Student Recreation Center, and the Student Health Center.

The Student Services Building contains most of the university&#x27;s student-related offices. Spread across four floors, students have easy access to help and consultation from advisors at the Undergraduate Admissions Office, Graduate School, Financial Aid Office, University Housing, Career Development Center, and numerous other offices.

The Student Center is a large building near the center of campus which serves as a hub for events held by students and community members. Containing over eight and a half acres of space, the building hosts food vendors, dining and study spaces, a bowling alley and pool room, Esports Arena, the University Bookstore, Sustainability Hub, the Craft Shop, and the Saluki Food Pantry. It is the former home of the WIDB 104.3 FM student-run radio station. It is also the main meeting space for most of SIU&#x27;s RSOs, as well as the Black Affairs Office, International Student Council, Student Programming Council, and both student governments.

The Student Recreation Center, or &quot;Rec,&quot; is the university&#x27;s primary hub for intramural and fitness activities. Most of the Rec&#x27;s budget is raised by a student recreation fee included in students&#x27; fees, meaning individual students do not need to pay for entrance or membership. Other revenue generated by instructional programs, camps, and community citizens who pay for membership.Indoor facilities include an Olympic-sized pool, areas for basketball, volleyball, racquetball, handball, and squash, a two-story running track, rooms for weightlifting, martial arts, and aerobics, and programs for the disabled.

The Student Health Center is connected to the Student Recreation Center on the east side of campus. The 57,000-square-foot health center offers a medical clinic, pharmacy, wellness resources, psychiatry clinic, sports medicine and physical therapy, and counseling and psychological services. Community partners Southern Illinois Dermatology and the Marion Eye Center also provide services.

===Instructional and research facilities===
The majority of SIU&#x27;s instructional and research facilities are enclosed on or within Lincoln Drive, which circles the university&#x27;s main campus on three sides before connecting with South Illinois Avenue. As the university expanded, new buildings with similar academic purposes to existing buildings were often added in the same location. As such, most students of any of SIU&#x27;s constituent colleges will only ever use a few of SIU&#x27;s main buildings.
One of the more recognizable buildings on campus is Pulliam Hall, the home of the School of Education and the location of SIU&#x27;s iconic clock tower. Pulliam was once known as Carbondale University High School, a functioning high school which served to train teachers. The College of Business occupies nearby Rehn Hall. The Neckers Building, Engineering Building, and Applied Sciences and Arts Building contain most of the university&#x27;s physical and chemical laboratories as well as lecture halls. The Neckers Building hosts several large telescopes, facilitating regular viewings of astronomical events. The College of Liberal Arts primarily occupies Faner Hall, whose design and size have made it a controversial symbol of the campus. Allegations that Faner was built to be riot-proof are likely apocryphal; however it is true that Faner is almost thirty feet longer than the Titanic. Faner is also the home of the University Museum which holds over 70,000 unique artifacts ranging from local history to original renaissance tapestries. Students of the agricultural sciences will spend their time in the Agricultural Building, which boasts an award-winning flower display and living wall. Students in the media arts occupy the Communications Building, which hosts the annual McLeod Summer Playhouse. SIU&#x27;s Law School is situated in the Lesar Law Building at the extreme west end of the campus.

All of the buildings on the main campus are connected by footpaths, interspersed with small parks and green areas. More heavily trafficked paths are lit up with brighter lighting at night as a safety feature. Students who choose to drive on campus will need to purchase a parking sticker from SIU&#x27;s Parking Division or else park at the pay station lot in front of the Student Center. Walking or biking is the preferred method of transport on-campus, although Carbondale and SIU entered into an agreement with Veo Scooters in 2022 to bring electric scooters to the campus during warmer months.
Morris Library is the main library for the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus. The library holds over five million volumes, 63,000 current periodicals and serials, and over 3.6 million microform units. It also provides access to the statewide automated library system (I-Share) and an array of online collections such as The Lancet, JSTOR, and The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The library is a member of the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois, Association of Research Libraries, and the Greater Western Library Alliance. SIU&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center, which holds unique and rare historical artifacts, and the Geospatial Resources area, which holds over 255,000 maps and 93,000 aerial photographs, are maintained in the library. The library is a registered depository for Illinois, U.S. Federal, and United Nations documents. Delyte&#x27;s, a coffee shop named after former SIU President Delyte W. Morris, operates near the entrance of the library.

===Old campus===
SIU&#x27;s &quot;First Building&quot; was chartered in 1869 and completed in 1874. This building burned in 1883 and was replaced by a building known as &quot;Old Main&quot;, which itself burned in 1969. While arson related to Vietnam War unrest continues to be suspected as the primary cause for the 1969 fire, this theory has never been conclusively proven. This second building was never replaced, and a rectangular green space remains where it once stood. This space is surrounded by some of the university&#x27;s earliest buildings, most of which were built throughout the early 1900s. Collectively, this area of campus is known as &quot;Old Campus&quot;.

To the east of the former site of Old Main is Davies Hall and Wheeler Hall, the latter of which served as SIU&#x27;s library until the construction of the original Morris Library. On the west side is Altgeld Hall, Shryock Auditorium, and the Allyn Building. Altgeld Hall, which served as the university&#x27;s science and astronomy building before being given to the School of Music, is affectionately known as &quot;The Castle&quot; due to its distinctive design. Similar buildings exist on four other Illinois university campuses, having been built with the funding and direction of Illinois governor John Altgeld. Shryock Auditorium is a large performance hall capped by an iconic domed roof, which was once made entirely of stained glass. The Auditorium was completed in 1918 and is named for SIU&#x27;s fifth President, Henry Shryock. On the south side of the old campus area is Anthony Hall and Parkinson Laboratory. Anthony Hall was the university&#x27;s first permanent dormitory structure; today it serves as an administrative office for executive staff. Being a women&#x27;s dormitory, it is named in honor of Susan B. Anthony. Parkinson Laboratory is named for the university&#x27;s fourth president, Daniel Parkinson, and has served continuously as the home of SIU&#x27;s geology department.

Near the Old Campus area is the Old Baptist Foundation building and Woody Hall. The former building is now used as a recital hall and the meeting place of SIU&#x27;s musical fraternity, while the latter building was completed in the early 1950s to take over Anthony Hall&#x27;s role as SIU&#x27;s permanent women&#x27;s dormitory. Woody Hall today serves as an administrative office space and alumni center.

===Natural scenery===

SIU&#x27;s campus has been recognized for its natural beauty. The most striking natural feature of the university is Campus Lake, formerly Thompson Lake, which is a 40-acre spring lake at the southwest end of the campus. The lake has been closed to swimmers for several years due to health concerns, but remains open to canoes and kayaks. In addition to this, the lake is ringed by a 2-mile walking trail popular with joggers and a large frisbee golf course. At the center of the campus is Thompson Woods, an area of natural woodlands crisscrossed by walking paths. The Thompson Woods is a completely natural area which was given to the university as a gift from the eponymous Thompson family, which once owned the woods and surrounding campus areas.

The Dorothy Morris Garden, Kumakura Garden, and Sculpture Garden are a collection of small gardens behind Faner hall. They include a tea house, fish pond, and numerous student-created sculptures. The gardens are located roughly on the former site of the home of Dorothy and Delyte Morris, SIU&#x27;s eighth president. SIU&#x27;s Rinella Field, a large green area in front of the East Campus residential area, is named after former Director of Housing Samuel Rinella. The field is often used for impromptu soccer matches as well as SIU&#x27;s Quidditch team.

SIU&#x27;s campus is located near Giant City State Park, Shawnee National Forest, and several other areas popular for hiking and camping. The campus also maintains a tagged category of its diverse tree inventory, which includes a rare Dawn Redwood planted in 1950 by William Marberry.

There are a number of derelict facilities on or related to the SIU campus which can still be visited by students. Just west of the Thompson Point housing area sits the remains of the Small Group Housing area, otherwise known as Greek Row. The set of two-story housing structures was originally built to provide safe housing space for the university&#x27;s growing fraternities and sororities, but this system largely collapsed in later decades. Southern Hills, another abandoned housing area, can be found just south of the East Campus towers along Logan Dr.

Further south of the university at the meeting of E. Pleasant Hill Road and S. Wall St. is the abandoned Marberry Arboretum. Known today by students as the &quot;Bamboo Forest&quot; due to its abundance of overgrown bamboo, the Marberry Arboretum was once owned by SIU faculty member William Marberry. The site contains a wide variety of plant species, but has not been regularly maintained by the Carbondale City Council.

Two completely demolished sites include the blue barracks and the Vocational Technical Institute.

==Organization and administration==
Systems of administration at SIU have greatly evolved since the university&#x27;s earliest days. The growth of the university after the appointment of President Delyte Morris led to shorter tenures and a speedier succession of leaders. Many of SIU&#x27;s Chancellors after this period were selected to serve in an interim capacity, a problem which persists in limited cases to this day. The early deaths of Chancellors Paul D. Sarvela and Carlo Montemagno only exacerbated this issue. The hiring of Austin Lane to fill the position of Chancellor in 2020 ended the succession issues that began after Chancellor Rita Cheng left to become President of Northern Arizona University.

The discrepancy between the title of President and Chancellor began after the founding of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1957, along with the proliferation of associated schools and programs that were created under the tenure of SIU President Delyte Morris. Currently, both SIU Carbondale and SIU Edwardsville are led by Chancellors, who in turn report to the President of the Southern Illinois University System. The current SIU System President is Daniel F. Mahoney.

Many of the buildings on the SIU campus are named after former Presidents and Chancellors. These include the Allyn Building, the Parkinson Laboratory, the Shryock Auditorium, the Pulliam Hall and the Pulliam Industrial Education Building, the Morris Library, the Hiram H. Lesar Law Building, and the Guyon Auditorium in Morris Library.

==Academics==
SIU offers 120 undergraduate majors, with more than 200 specializations, and over 100 minors. Its programs also include 80 master&#x27;s degrees and 40 doctoral degrees, in addition to professional degrees in law and medicine. The university provides general and professional training ranging from two-year associate degrees to doctoral programs, as well as certificate and non-degree programs meeting the needs of those uninterested in degree education.

SIU enrolls students from all 50 US states and over 100 other nations. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity&quot;. In 2022, The Princeton Review included SIU Carbondale among its &quot;Best of the Midwest&quot;.

===Curriculum===
The various colleges, schools, and academic departments which make up SIU have been reorganized and renamed countless times since the university&#x27;s founding. SIU&#x27;s original designation as a teachers&#x27; college, or normal school, means many of its current academic programs can trace their establishment to a period before the creation of the college they belong to today. Only the College of Liberal Arts can trace an unbroken lineage to the year SIU was officially granted limited university status in 1943.

The College of Agricultural, Life, and Physical Sciences, and the College of Health and Human Sciences were created from the now-defunct College of Science, College of Agriculture, and College of Applied Science and Arts. The College of Engineering, Computing, Technology, and Math was originally created as the College of Engineering and Technology; the result of a protracted effort to create an independent engineering college. The most recent reordering occurred when the College of Mass Communications and Media Arts became the College of Arts and Media.

The College of Agricultural, Life, and Physical Sciences consists of six constituent schools and several pre-health professional programs. It is based in the Agricultural Building, which was constructed in 1957. The college offers experiential opportunities for students in the form of a 2,000+ acre working farm, tree improvement center, and other hands-on activities. SIU is the only public university in Illinois to offer a zoology program, and one of only two to offer programs in botany and microbiology.

The College of Arts and Media consists of six constituent schools, including the School of Architecture, School of Art and Design, School of Arts and Media, School of Music, and School of Journalism and Advertising. As a mixture of liberal arts and digital humanities, the College of Arts and Media combines practical education with programs catering to creative pursuits. SIU offers a number of programs associated with College of Arts and Media students, including the McLeod Summer Playhouse theatre series, the Southern Illinois Symphony Orchestra, and SIU&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Daily Egyptian&quot;.

The College of Business and Analytics consists of three constituent schools, focusing on three major areas of academic focus for the college: the School of Accountancy, the School of Analytics, Finance, and Economics, and the School of Management and Marketing. Due to its association with the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Analytics, Finance, and Economics offers a B.A. degree in economics, one of only a few B.S. programs at SIU to also offer a B.A. option. The college offers numerous research facilities, including a trading floor equipped with Bloomberg terminals. The Saluki Student Investment Fund, a student organization directed by the college, manages a $3.8 million portfolio for the university. The college also offers an online M.B.A. program that was ranked #58 in the nation in 2023.

The College of Engineering, Computing, Technology, and Mathematics consists of six constituent schools with a wide range of national accreditation. The college is housed in a modern four-building engineering complex located near Campus Lake. The college is one of the few institutions in the United States to offer a concurrent masters with a J.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Law. Students in the School of Computing can choose between a B.A. and a B.S. degree in Computer Science, with the option to focus on Graphic Design and/or Game Design and Development by completing a joint minor with the College of Arts and Media.

The College of Health and Human Sciences consists of six constituent schools, with programs ranging from the School of Aviation, School of Automotive, Allied Health, to the School of Justice and Public Safety as well as the School of Psychological and Behavioral Sciences. SIU&#x27;s School of Aviation, which maintains separate facilities at the Transportation Education Center along with the school of Automotive near Southern Illinois Airport, hosts the nationally recognized Flying Salukis.

The College of Liberal Arts consists of six constituent schools. The college&#x27;s programs are augmented with faculty-sponsored research experiences, the ability to mix and match majors and minors to suit preferences and needs, access to internships, study abroad opportunities, and the university honors program. Most of the college&#x27;s classrooms and offices are found in Faner Hall.

==Student life==
SIU has a vibrant student culture and is home to more than 300 Registered Student Organizations (RSOs). Student groups include honor societies, sports clubs, fraternities and sororities, religious organizations, student governments, and other special interest groups. The largest RSO on campus is the Student Programming Council, which organizes events such as concerts, comedy shows, lectures, film showings, and homecoming celebrations.

===Student housing===
On-campus housing at SIU has developed steadily from the completion of a second women&#x27;s dormitory in 1953 to the expansive system of tower blocks and apartment buildings that exists today. Housing is provided in residence halls and apartments both on and near campus. Different housing opportunities are offered to undergraduates, graduates, international students, parents, and married couples.

The two main residence hall areas are known as East Campus and West Campus. West Campus, also known as Thompson Point, consists of 11 three-story dormitory structures and was built between 1957 and 1962. East Campus, also known as the Brush Towers, consists of 3 seventeen-story high rises and was built between 1965 and 1968. Each site also includes a commons building and dining hall. The traditional housing contract includes a furnished room, WiFi, utilities, and a dining plan. Residence hall rooms are fully furnished, and many have been modified to meet the needs of specific types of disability. Apartment housing is available at Evergreen Terrace, Wall &amp; Grand, and Elizabeth Apartments.

All single students under the age of 21, not residing with their parents or legal guardians, with fewer than 26 credit hours earned after high school are required to live in University-owned and operated residence halls per university policy. This policy can be circumvented if the student is living in the permanent home of a parent or guardian, provided the home is within 60 miles of campus. Furthermore, university apartment housing is restricted to those students who are married, parents, graduate students, or who are over the age of 21; the effect of this policy means that freshmen and sophomore students often live in dormitories, while older students reside in on and off-campus apartments.

===Student government===
SIU has two primary bodies of student government responsible for advising the SIU administration on student needs. The student governments are also responsible for distributing funds collected from the student activity fee to eligible RSOs. The two student governments are:
* The Undergraduate Student Government (USG)
* The Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)

Additionally, one student is elected as a student trustee and appointed by the governor to serve as a voting member of the SIU Board of Trustees.

===Greek life===
SIU is home to 17 registered fraternities and 10 registered sororities, including 7 multicultural fraternities and sororities. The Greek organizations are governed by the Interfraternity Council, The College Panhellenic Association, The Multicultural Greek Council, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council. They are responsible to the dean of students and the Office of Student Affairs. Popular events held by Greek organizations include the Go Greek Barbecue and the annual &quot;Greek Sing&quot; talent contest.

All members of the Greek organizations at SIU must maintain a 2.0 GPA or higher to be members. The university rigorously restricts hazing and discriminatory induction practices. The first fraternity and sorority appeared on SIU&#x27;s campus in 1923, although the introduction, chartering, and growth of many of the Greek groups on-campus today occurred during or after the 1940s.

===Student newspaper===
SIU&#x27;s student-run newspaper, &quot;The Daily Egyptian&quot;, has been printed without interruption since the spring of 1921. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Egyptian&quot; is published weekly in print and online during the fall and spring semesters. It has a distribution of 7,800 copies and reaches nearly 200 locations. The paper has received more than 25 awards from the Illinois College Press Association. In 2002 it received the National Newspaper Pacemaker Award for General Excellence, and in 2017 and 2018 it received the National Online Pacemaker Award. &quot;The Daily Egyptian&quot; was one of only a few university newspapers in the United States to own and operate its own printing press. The press was retired in 2015 after nearly 50 years of continuous service.

Gus Bode, a cartoon character created to give satirical commentary on the paper&#x27;s articles, has appeared regularly in the paper since 1956.

Past editions of &quot;The Daily Egyptian&quot; and other SIU student newspapers going back to 1888 are maintained on-campus by Morris Library.

===Saluki patrol===
Founded in 1959, the Saluki Patrol is one of the oldest student security teams in the country. Organized as a form of community policing, the Saluki Patrol assists the Department of Public Safety in their duties by performing foot patrols, conducting traffic enforcement, and serving as crowd control. Members of the Saluki Patrol can often be seen on-campus in the evenings and at major on-campus sporting events.

The Saluki Patrol has continued to evolve and become more professional, with personnel receiving some of the same police training as sworn officers. Many leaders in the law enforcement community both locally and at the state and federal level began their careers as a Saluki Patrol.

===Cardboard boat regatta===

The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats, and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

&quot;Commodore&quot; Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, created the regatta as a final examination for students in his freshman design class in 1974. Archer was inspired by Buckminster Fuller, then a distinguished professor at SIU, who had espoused the principle of &quot;doing the most with the least.&quot; Participation peaked in the late 1980s and 90s, drawing crowds upwards of 20,000 people and receiving coverage on CNN&#x27;s Good Morning America.

===Saluki startup and weeks of welcome===
The Saluki Startup &amp; Weeks of Welcome are held during the first five weeks of the fall semester and include a range of activities designed to introduce new students to campus. Events include job fairs, theater and orchestra auditions, a pep rally, paint and sips, concerts, RSO fairs, a pickleball tournament, board game nights, and organized meetups between the students and faculty of each college.

These events coincide with the DuQuoin State Fair and the annual football game between SIU and SEMO, called the &quot;War for the Wheel&quot;. Both of these events are attended by SIU students as part of the Weeks of Welcome.

==Athletics==


Southern Illinois University&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are collectively known as the Southern Illinois Salukis. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were informally known as the Maroons. Students and faculty began lobbying for a new name and mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official name to the Salukis. The selection of the Saluki, a royal dog of ancient Egypt, as the university&#x27;s mascot is often attributed to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and the southern Illinois region&#x27;s colloquial nickname, &quot;Little Egypt&quot;. The first women&#x27;s sports teams were formed in 1959, and all athletics programs were merged in 1988.

SIU is classified as an NCAA Division I school. Most varsity SIU teams compete in the Missouri Valley Conference, specifically in basketball, cross country, golf, softball, women&#x27;s swimming, women&#x27;s tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Men&#x27;s swimming and diving is part of the Mid-American Conference.

Between the spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, SIU athletics was led by three-time national coach-of-the-year Jerry Kill. He was replaced by Liz Jarnigan, who left the university in 2021 amid an alleged cover-up scandal. As of 2022, SIU&#x27;s athletics director is Tim Leonard, former athletics director for Towson University.

<text>The Libertarian Party of Canada () is a federal political party in Canada founded in 1973. The party subscribes to libertarian and classical liberal tenets; its stated mission is to reduce the size, scope, and cost of government. Party policies include ending drug prohibition, ending government censorship, lowering taxes, protecting gun rights, ending laws criminalising the voluntary transfer of money for sex acts between consenting adults, and non-interventionism.

== History ==
The party was founded on 7 July 1973 by Bruce Evoy (who became its first chairman) and seven others. Evoy ran unsuccessfully for election to Parliament in the 1974 federal election in the Toronto riding of Rosedale. The party achieved registered status in the 1979 federal election by running more than fifty candidates.

The party described itself as Canada&#x27;s &quot;fourth party&quot; in the 1980s, but it has since been displaced by new parties such as the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party of Canada. The party declined to join the Reform Party of Canada when it was formed in 1987. Many Libertarians were also attracted to provincial Progressive Conservative parties that moved to the right during the 1990s in Ontario under Mike Harris and in Alberta under Ralph Klein. The decline in the party&#x27;s membership and resources resulted in Elections Canada removing their status as a registered party immediately before the 1997 federal election when the party failed to run the minimum fifty candidates needed to maintain its registration.

Jean-Serge Brisson led the party from 22 May 2000 until 18 May 2008, when he was succeeded by Dennis Young. Young defeated outgoing party president Alan Mercer for the leadership. Savannah Linklater was elected deputy leader. In May 2011, Katrina Chowne was elected leader of the Libertarian Party. In May 2014, Tim Moen was elected leader of the Libertarian Party.

In the 2015 federal election, the party fielded 72 candidates and solidified their position as the sixth federal party in Canada, with growth over 500% from the 2011 federal election.

The next Federal Libertarian Party of Canada Convention took place in Ottawa from 5 July through 7 July 2018, concluding on the 45th anniversary of the party.

In September 2018, Moen, who had previously offered the leadership of the Libertarian Party to Maxime Bernier, stated that he was open to the idea of a merger with Bernier&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party of Canada. When asked by &quot;Global News&quot;, Bernier indicated he had no interest in a merger.

== Election results ==

<text>Arthur Greenwood (8 February 1880 – 9 June 1954) was a British politician. A prominent member of the Labour Party from the 1920s until the late 1940s, Greenwood rose to prominence within the party as secretary of its research department from 1920 and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in the short-lived Labour government of 1924. In 1940, he was instrumental in resolving that Britain would continue fighting Nazi Germany in World War II.

==Early life==
Greenwood was born in Hunslet, Leeds, the son of a painter and decorator. He was educated at the Yorkshire College (which later became the University of Leeds), where he took a BSc.

==Political career==

Greenwood was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election for the constituency of Nelson and Colne in Lancashire. He held the seat until being defeated at the 1931 election, but returned to Parliament the following year, winning a by-election in the Yorkshire constituency of Wakefield. Greenwood continued to represent Wakefield until his death in 1954. Greenwood was an active freemason, associated with the New Welcome Lodge.

In 1929, Greenwood was appointed Minister of Health, remaining in the post until the collapse of the Labour government in August 1931; he was sworn into the Privy Council at the time of his appointment. During his period at the Ministry of Health, Greenwood raised widows&#x27; pensions and through the Housing Act 1930 enacted large-scale slum clearance.

Greenwood became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party under Clement Attlee. During the 1935 General Election campaign, Greenwood attacked Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament, saying that the rearmament policy was &quot;the merest scaremongering; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr Chamberlain&#x27;s responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments.&quot;

On 2 September 1939, acting for Attlee who was in hospital for prostate surgery, he was called to respond to Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s ambivalent speech on whether Britain would aid Poland. As he was about to speak, he was interrupted by an angry Conservative backbencher and former First Lord of the Admiralty, Leo Amery, who electrified the chamber when he exclaimed loud and clear: &quot;Speak for England, Arthur!&quot;

A flustered Greenwood proceeded to denounce Chamberlain&#x27;s remarks, to the applause of both sides of the House, in a short speech for which he is best remembered.
When the wartime coalition government was formed, Winston Churchill appointed him to the War Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio in 1940. He was generally seen as ineffectual, but in May 1940 he emerged as Churchill&#x27;s strongest and most vocal supporter in the lengthy War Cabinet debates on whether to accept or reject a peace offer from Germany. Without the vote in favour of fighting on by Greenwood and Clement Attlee, Churchill would not have had the slim majority he needed to do so.

After that, his influence declined, and he resigned in 1943. The same year, he was elected as Treasurer of the Labour Party, beating Herbert Morrison in a close contest.

From February 1942 until the end of World War II, Greenwood also performed the function of Leader of the Opposition, though he did not receive the salary.

During the Attlee government, he served successively as Lord Privy Seal and Paymaster General.

==Death==
Greenwood died on 9 June 1954 at the age of 74, being cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 14 June 1954. His ashes and memorial lie in Bay 17 of the East Boundary Wall.

==Family==

Greenwood&#x27;s son Anthony Greenwood (later Lord Greenwood, 1911–1982) was an MP from 1946 until 1970, first for Heywood and Radcliffe and later for Rossendale, and a member of Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments.
