<text>Psyllidae, the jumping plant lice or psyllids, are a family of small plant-feeding insects that tend to be very host-specific, i.e. each plant-louse species only feeds on one plant species (monophagous) or feeds on a few closely related plants (oligophagous). Together with aphids, phylloxerans, scale insects and whiteflies, they form the group called Sternorrhyncha, which is considered to be the most &quot;primitive&quot; group within the true bugs (Hemiptera). They have traditionally been considered a single family, Psyllidae, but recent classifications divide the group into a total of seven families; the present restricted definition still includes more than 70 genera in the Psyllidae.
Psyllid fossils have been found from the Early Permian before the flowering plants evolved. The explosive diversification of the flowering plants in the Cretaceous was paralleled by a massive diversification of associated insects, and many of the morphological and metabolic characters that the flowering plants exhibit may have evolved as defenses against herbivorous insects.

Several genera of psyllids, especially among the Australian fauna, secrete coverings called &quot;lerps&quot; over their bodies, presumably to conceal them from predators and parasites.

Note: the genus &quot;Pachypsylla&quot; is now placed in the family Carsidaridae.

==Coevolution==

Insect-plant interactions have been important in defining models of coevolution and cospeciation, referring to whether plant speciation drives insect speciation and vice versa, though most herbivorous insects probably evolved long after the plants on which they feed.

==Status as pests==
With taxonomic revisions at genus level and above, species including agricultural pests, that have been classed as &quot;Psyllids&quot; may now placed in other families including the Carsidaridae, Liviidae and Triozidae.

Citrus greening, also known as &quot;huanglongbing&quot;, associated with the presence of a bacterium &quot;Liberibacter asiaticum&quot;, is an example of a plant pathogen that has coevolved with its insect vector, the &quot;Asian citrus psyllid&quot;, ACP, &quot;Diaphorina citri&quot;, such that the pathogen causes little or no harm to the insect, but causes a major disease which can reduce citrus quality, flavor, and production, as well as causing citrus trees to die. ACP was found in Florida in 1998, and has since spread across the southern US into Texas. This disease was found in Florida citrus groves in 2005. Management methods to reduce the spread of this disease and psyllid populations depend on an integrated pest management approach using insecticides, parasitoids, predators, and pathogens specific to ACP. Due to the spread of citrus greening worldwide and the growing importance of psyllid-spread diseases, an International Psyllid Genome Consortium was established. Insect genomics provides important information on the genetic basis of the pest&#x27;s biology which may be altered to suppress psyllid populations in an environmentally friendly manner. The emerging psyllid genome continues to elucidate psyllid biology, expanding what is known about gene families, genetic variation, and gene expression in insects. Thus far, two new psyllid viruses have been discovered, and are being examined as potential biological control agents to reduce psyllid populations. Psyllid cell cultures have also been established by several researchers working with virus propagation, and as a system to propagate &quot;C. liberibacter&quot; for molecular studies on infection and replication. Studies on the microbiota have also identified four new species of bacteria. Thus far, 10 microbial organisms have been identified within these psyllids, among them the primary endosymbiont, whose genome has been sequenced and posted at the NCBI database, as well as a &quot;Wolbachia&quot; species.

<text>In mathematics, specifically ring theory, a left primitive ideal is the annihilator of a (nonzero) simple left module. A right primitive ideal is defined similarly. Left and right primitive ideals are always two-sided ideals.

Primitive ideals are prime. The quotient of a ring by a left primitive ideal is a left primitive ring. For commutative rings the primitive ideals are maximal, and so commutative primitive rings are all fields.

== Primitive spectrum ==

The primitive spectrum of a ring is a non-commutative analog of the prime spectrum of a commutative ring.

Let &quot;A&quot; be a ring and formula_1 the set of all primitive ideals of &quot;A&quot;. Then there is a topology on formula_1, called the Jacobson topology, defined so that the closure of a subset &quot;T&quot; is the set of primitive ideals of &quot;A&quot; containing the intersection of elements of &quot;T&quot;.

Now, suppose &quot;A&quot; is an associative algebra over a field. Then, by definition, a primitive ideal is the kernel of an irreducible representation formula_3 of &quot;A&quot; and thus there is a surjection
: formula_4

Example: the spectrum of a unital C*-algebra.

<doc id="485843" wikidata="Q1548077" url="?curid=485843" title="Trillium grandiflorum">
<text>Trillium grandiflorum, the white trillium, large-flowered trillium, great white trillium, white wake-robin or , is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. A monocotyledonous, herbaceous perennial, the plant is native to eastern North America, from northern Quebec to the southern parts of the United States through the Appalachian Mountains into northernmost Georgia and west to Minnesota. There are also several isolated populations in Nova Scotia, Maine, southern Illinois, and Iowa.

&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is most common in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily recognized by its attractive three-petalled white flowers, opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three leaf-like bracts. It is an example of a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronized with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.

White trillium often occurs in dense drifts of many individuals. The G. Richard Thompson Wildlife Management Area in the Blue Ridge Mountains is renowned for an extensive stand of white trillium that blooms each spring. Over a two square mile area along the Appalachian Trail near Linden, Virginia there is a spectacular annual display of white trilliums estimated at near ten million individuals.

==Description==
&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is a perennial that grows from a short rhizome and produces a single, showy white flower atop a whorl of three leaves. Flowering stems are tall. The leaves are often called bracts as the &quot;stem&quot; is then considered a peduncle (the rhizome is the stem proper, aboveground shoots of a rhizome are branches or peduncles); the distinction between bracts (found on pedicels or peduncles) and leaves (borne on stems). A single rootstock will often form clonal colonies, which can become very large and dense.

The erect, odorless flowers are large, especially compared to other species of &quot;Trillium&quot;, with long petals, depending on age and vigor. The petals are shaped much like the leaves and curve outward. They have a visible venation, though this is not as heavily marked as on the leaves. Their overlapping bases and curve give the flowers a distinctive funnel shape. Between the veined petals, three acuminate (ending with a long point) sepals are visible; they are usually a paler shade of green than the leaves, and are sometimes streaked with maroon. The flowers are perched on a pedicel (i.e., flower stalk) raising them above the leaf whorl, and grow pinker as they age. The flowers&#x27; stigmas are slender, straight or mostly so, narrowing at the end. The white petals are much longer than the green sepals. The flowers have six stamens in two whorls of three, which persist after fruiting. The styles are white and very short compared to the anthers, which are pale yellow, but become a brighter shade when liberating pollen due to the latter&#x27;s color. The ovaries are six-sided with three greenish-white stigmas that are at first weakly attached, but fuse higher up. The fruit is a green, mealy and moist orb, and is vaguely six-sided like the ovary.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; was first described by André Michaux in 1803 as variety &quot;grandiflorum&quot; of &quot;Trillium rhomboideum&quot;, a species now regarded as a synonym of &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;erectum&quot;. Michaux described the variety as having broadly rhombic leaves, large white petals, and black fruit. The epithet &quot;grandiflorum&quot; means &quot;large-flowered&quot;, a name that well describes Michaux&#x27;s variety. In 1805, Richard Anthony Salisbury elevated the variety to a full species. As a consequence, and partially by accident, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is commonly known as the large-flowered white trillium.

, the name &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;  is widely recognized. The species is a member of the Grandiflorum group, a group of species typified by &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; itself. The group, which also includes &quot;Trillium nivale&quot; and &quot;Trillium ovatum&quot;, is sister to a clade comprising subgenus &quot;Sessilia&quot; (the sessile-flowered trilliums) and subgenus &quot;Delostylis&quot; (the Catesbaei group).

, Plants of the World Online (POWO) lists 20 synonyms for &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;. Although POWO accepts no infraspecific names, numerous varieties and forms have been described. Of these, perhaps the best known is &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; f. &quot;roseum&quot; , which was described by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1920. The flower of forma &quot;roseum&quot; opens a striking salmon-pink instead of the more typical white. The pink color of the form is warmer and more attractive than the pink induced by aging. It occurs rarely throughout the range of the species, except along the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where it is locally frequent. The epithet &quot;roseum&quot; means &quot;rose-like, rose-colored&quot;, and so the form is sometimes called the rose trillium.

&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;, unlike most trilliums, occasionally produces double-flowered forms with more than three petals. &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; f. &quot;polymerum&quot; , a multipetaled form described by Marie-Victorin Kirouac in 1929, occurs rather frequently in this species. Although these wild forms are stable and healthy, the plants usually lack normal floral organs and are therefore completely sterile. The epithet &quot;polymerum&quot; means &quot;many-parts&quot;, which in this case refers to the many flower petals of the form.

Some variants of &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; have abnormal green markings on the petals (floral virescence), floral organs that take on a leaf-like appearance (phyllody), or other abnormal characteristics. Many of these forms have been given taxonomic names with epithets such as &quot;albomarginatum&quot; (&quot;white-margined&quot;, referring to the petals), &quot;foliaceum&quot;, (&quot;leaf-like, leafy&quot;), &quot;giganteum&quot; (&quot;unusually large or tall&quot;), and &quot;longipetiolatum&quot; (&quot;with long petioles&quot;). A typical example is the variety &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; var. &quot;variegatum&quot; , described by Erwin Frink Smith in 1879. The epithet &quot;variegatum&quot; (&quot;streaked or spotted with color&quot;) refers to its virescent petals, a distinguishing characteristic of this variety. In 1971, it was shown that mycoplasma-like organisms (now called phytoplasmas) were present in all such forms examined (but not in normal plants). The authors concluded that &quot;such plants should now be regarded as diseased &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; and the varietal designation of Smith should be considered invalid.&quot;

Unlike other species such as &quot;Trillium erectum&quot;, which hybridize fairly easily, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is not known to form hybrids.

==Ecology==
&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; favors well-drained, neutral to slightly acid soils, usually in second- or young-growth forests. In the Northern parts of its range it shows an affinity for maple or beech forests, but has also been known to spread into nearby open areas. Depending on geographical factors, it flowers from late April to early June, just after &quot;Trillium erectum&quot;. Like many forest perennials, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is a slow growing plant. Its seeds have double dormancy, meaning they normally take at least two years to fully germinate. The seeds are dispersed in late summer, germinating after a cold and then a warm period, producing a root and after another winter the seedling&#x27;s cotyledon emerges from the soil. Like most species of &quot;Trillium&quot;, flowering age is determined largely by the surface of the leaf and size of the rhizome instead of age alone. Because growth is very slow in nature, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; typically requires seven to ten years in optimal conditions to reach flowering size, which corresponds to a minimum of of leaf surface area and of rhizome volume. In cultivation, however, wide disparity of flowering ages are observed.

===Pollination and seed dispersal===
&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; has long been thought to self-pollinate based on the fact that pollinators had rarely been observed visiting the plants and because there is low variation in chromosomal banding patterns. This has been strongly challenged, as other studies have shown high pollination rates by bumblebees and very low success of self-pollination in controlled experiments, implying that they are in fact self-incompatible. Several ovules of a given individual often fail to produce seeds. One contributing factor is pollen limitation, and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56% of their ovules produce seeds, while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66%. Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33% to 50% less likely to produce fruits than those that were, while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100% fruit set (though these fruits did not contain a 100% seed set). Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production: when pollen was in abundance, larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones. The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination, where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season.

&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; has been studied extensively by ecologists due to a number of unique features it possesses. It is a representative example of a plant whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant&#x27;s ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has also been shown to be an effective index of how intense foraging by deer is in a particular area.

Fruits are released in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (&quot;Vespula vulgaris&quot;) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided by the presence of a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.

Although myrmecochory is by far the most common dispersal method, white-tailed deer have also been shown to disperse the seeds on rare occasions by ingestion and defecation. While ants only move seeds up to about , deer have been observed to transport the seeds over . This helps to explain post-agricultural colonization of forest sites by &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;, as well as long distance gene flow which has been detected in other studies. Furthermore, it helps resolve what has been called &quot;Reid&#x27;s paradox&quot;, which states that migration during glaciation events must have been impossible for plants with dispersal rates under several hundred meters (yards) per year, such as &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;. Thus occasional long distance dispersal events, such as by deer, probably helped save this and other species with otherwise short distance dispersal ability from extinction during the glaciations of the ice ages. Furthermore, nested clade analysis of cpDNA haplotypes has shown that &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is likely to have persisted through the last glacial period in two sites of refuge in the southeastern United States and that long distance dispersal was responsible for the post-glacial recolonization of northern areas.

In addition to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance in the fact that burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few &amp; short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.

===Interaction with deer===
&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; as well as other trilliums are a favored food of white-tailed deer. Indeed, if trilliums are available deer will seek these plants, with a preference for &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot;, to the exclusion of others. In the course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This information can be used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.

When foraging intensity increases, individuals become shorter each growing season due to the reduction in energy reserves from less photosynthetic production. One study determined that the ideal deer density in northeastern Illinois, based on &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; as an indicator of overall understory health, is 4 to 6 animals per square kilometer (10 to 15 per sq. mi.). This is based on a 12 to 14 cm (5&quot; to 6&quot;) stem height as an acceptable healthy height. In practice, deer densities as high as 30 deer per square kilometers (80 per sq. mi.) are known to occur in restricted or fractured habitat where natural control mechanisms (that is, predators like wolves) are lacking. Such densities, if maintained over more than a few years, can be very damaging to the understory and lead to extinction of some local understory plant populations.

===Disease===

&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is susceptible to a greening disorder caused by bacterial organisms called phytoplasmas that alter the morphology of infected plants. Symptoms of phytoplasma infection include abnormal green markings on the petals (floral virescence), extra leaves (phyllody), and other abnormal characteristics. Infected populations occur throughout the species range but are prevalent in Ontario, Michigan, and New York.

For many years, this condition was thought to originate from mutation, and so many of these forms were given taxonomic names now known to be invalid. In 1971, Hooper, Case, and Meyers used electron microscopy to detect the presence of mycoplasma-like organisms (i.e., phytoplasmas) in &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; with virescent petals. The means of transmission was not established but leafhoppers were suspected. , the insect vector for the disorder is unknown.

Phytoplasmas were positively identified in &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; and &quot;T. erectum&quot; in Ontario in 2016 and later confirmed in 2019. Phylogenetic analysis supported the grouping of the phytoplasmas isolated from infected plants as a related strain of &#x27;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Phytoplasma pruni&#x27; (subgroup 16SrIII-F) with 99% sequence identity. This subgroup of phytoplasmas is associated with various other diseases, including milkweed yellows, &quot;Vaccinium&quot; witches&#x27; broom, and potato purple top.

==Conservation==
Some forms of the species have pink instead of white petals, while others with extra petals, also called &quot;double&quot; forms, are naturally quite common in the species, and these are especially popular with trillium gardeners. In fact, the species is the most popular of its genus in cultivation, which has led to conservation concerns due to the majority of commercially available plants being collected from the wild. A few regional governments in Canada and the United States have declared the plant vulnerable as a result. In Quebec, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is legally listed as vulnerable primarily due to habitat destruction in forests neighboring the province&#x27;s most populous regions. In New York, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is exploitably vulnerable since it is &quot;likely to become threatened in the near future throughout all or a significant portion of its range within the state if causal factors continue unchecked&quot; (NYCRR §193.3).

Due to the popularity of &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; as a garden specimen, conservation concerns have been raised as the vast majority of plants sold in commercial nurseries are believed to be collected from the wild. Indeed, there is little indication of any commercial nursery growth. Frederick and Roberta Case, botanists who specialize in trilliums, wrote in 1997, &quot;to our knowledge, no true commercial quantity &#x27;propagation&#x27; takes place at the present time.&quot; Such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas.

, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is globally secure. The species is vulnerable in Quebec, Georgia, and Illinois; and critically imperiled in Nova Scotia, Alabama, New Jersey, and South Carolina. In Maine, where its presence has not been verified in over 20 years, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is listed as potentially extirpated.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; is one of the most popular trilliums in cultivation, primarily because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; can continue flowering every year after it has begun. It is winter hardy in USDA zones 4-8.

A double-flowered cultivar, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; &#x27;Pamela Copeland&#x27;, was introduced to cultivation at the Mount Cuba Center and named for Mrs. Pamela du Pont Copeland, the center&#x27;s founder.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Uses==
The leaves were cooked and eaten by some Native Americans. The subterranean rootstalks were also chewed for various medical purposes.

==Culture==
The large white trillium is a well-known and popular American flower. The &quot;Trillium&quot; species most often observed by citizen scientists is &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot;.

The flower&#x27;s common name, wake-robin, was the title of American naturalist and essayist John Burroughs&#x27;s first essay collection, &quot;Wake-Robin.&quot;

As a particularly conspicuous forest flower, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; was designated the provincial floral emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Floral Emblem Act), and as the state wild flower of Ohio in 1987. Professional soccer teams from Toronto and Columbus compete for the Trillium Cup every year.

As an official symbol of Ontario, a stylized trillium flower features prominently in the wordmark of the Government of Ontario and on the official flag of the province&#x27;s French-speaking minority. Government agencies and programs also frequently incorporate the word &quot;trillium&quot; in their names, such as the Trillium Gift of Life Network (organ donation management agency) and the Trillium Book Award (an annual literary award sponsored by the provincial government). It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike widely believed, specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) to pick the species in Ontario.

<doc id="485846" wikidata="Q17016164" url="?curid=485846" title="Hunky punk">
<text>A hunky punk is a grotesque carving on the side of a building, especially Late Gothic churches. Such features are especially numerous in Somerset (in the West Country of England).

Though similar in appearance to a gargoyle, a hunky punk is purely decorative, with no other functional purpose (often referred to as a grotesque). A gargoyle is not strictly a hunky punk, because a gargoyle serves to drain water off the roof through its mouth. An example might be found at the corner of a church tower, along the coping ridge below any castellations. Often there are carvings on each corner, yet the roof may only drain in one direction and so there might be three hunky punks and one true gargoyle.

Hunky punks are often short squatting figures typical of those found in some Somerset churches; however, hunky punks come in many shapes and sizes, mostly in middle to late medieval construction onwards. Some theories consider that the balance of good and evil in church design was to remind worshippers of the narrow path they tread, which was present in everything. This supposes that, for every good and benign creature (such as a saint or an animal) to signify purity, there had to be an opposite to bring out the fear of evil. In York Minster, for example, the carvings in the chapter house, which are particularly obscene and which were supposedly created as caricatures of the then dean and chapter, were put there above the seats to create an opposite to each occupant, who one might like to assume was not in fact the foul person their carvings made them out to be.

The origin of the term &quot;hunky punk&quot; has been ascribed to the words &#x27; (meaning &#x27;es&#x27;) and&#x27; (&#x27;short-legged&#x27;).

==Examples==

The church tower of St Mary the Virgin, Isle Abbotts has eight hunky punks around its top. They depict a person playing the bagpipes, a lion-dog (Chinese guardian lion), a goat, a dragon, a Chinese dragon, a primitive dragon, a winged lion and a lion.

<doc id="485854" wikidata="Q115548011" url="?curid=485854" title="Transition metal alkoxide complex">
<text>A transition metal alkoxide complex is a kind of coordination complex containing one or more alkoxide ligands, written as , where R is the organic substituent. Metal alkoxides are used for coatings and as catalysts.

==Preparation==
===By metathesis reactions===
Many alkoxides are prepared by salt-forming reactions from a metal chlorides and sodium alkoxide:
Such reactions are favored by the lattice energy of the NaCl, and purification of the product alkoxide is simplified by the fact that NaCl is insoluble in common organic solvents.
For electrophilic metal halides, conversion to the alkoxide requires no or mild base. Titanium tetrachloride reacts with alcohols to give the corresponding tetraalkoxides, concomitant with the evolution of hydrogen chloride:
The reaction can be accelerated by the addition of a base, such as a tertiary amine. Other electrophilic metal halides can be used instead of titanium, for example .

===By electrochemical processes===
Many alkoxides can be prepared by anodic dissolution of the corresponding metals in water-free alcohols in the presence of electroconductive additive. The metals may be Co, Ga, Ge, Hf, Fe, Ni, Nb, Mo, La, Re, Sc, Si, Ti, Ta, W, Y, Zr, etc. The conductive additive may be lithium chloride, quaternary ammonium halide, or other. Some examples of metal alkoxides obtained by this technique: , , , , , , and .

==Reactions==
===Hydrolysis and transesterification===
Aliphatic metal alkoxides decompose in water: where R is an organic substituent and L is an unspecified ligand (often an alkoxide). A well-studied case is the irreversible hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide:

By controlling the stoichiometry and steric properties of the alkoxide, such reactions can be arrested leading to metal-oxy-alkoxides, which usually are oligonuclear. Other alcohols can be employed in place of water. In this way one alkoxide can be converted to another, and the process is properly referred to as alcoholysis (although there is an issue of terminology confusion with transesterification, a different process - see below). The position of the equilibrium can be controlled by the acidity of the alcohol; for example phenols typically react with alkoxides to release alcohols, giving the corresponding phenoxide. More simply, the alcoholysis can be controlled by selectively evaporating the more volatile component. In this way, ethoxides can be converted to butoxides, since ethanol (b.p. 78 °C) is more volatile than butanol (b.p. 118 °C).

===Formation of oxo-alkoxides===
Many metal alkoxide compounds also feature oxo-ligands. Oxo-ligands typically arise via the hydrolysis, often accidentally, and via ether elimination:
Additionally, low valent metal alkoxides are susceptible to oxidation by air.

Characteristically, transition metal alkoxides are polynuclear, that is they contain more than one metal. Alkoxides are sterically undemanding and highly basic ligands that tend to bridge metals.

Upon the isomorphic substitution of metal atoms close in properties crystalline complexes of variable composition are formed. The metal ratio in such compounds can vary over a broad range. For instance, the substitution of molybdenum and tungsten for rhenium in the complexes allowed one to obtain complexes in the range and in the range .

===Insertion into M-OR bond===
Alkoxide ligands are often nucleophilic. They often undergo insertion reactions with unsaturated substrates such as carbon dioxide and isocyanates .

===Hydrogenolysis===
The metal-alkoxide bond is susceptible to hydrogenolysis, especially for platinum metal derivatives:

<doc id="485855" wikidata="Q7449622" url="?curid=485855" title="Semiprimitive ring">
<text>In algebra, a semiprimitive ring or Jacobson semisimple ring or J-semisimple ring is a ring whose Jacobson radical is zero. This is a type of ring more general than a semisimple ring, but where simple modules still provide enough information about the ring. Rings such as the ring of integers are semiprimitive, and an artinian semiprimitive ring is just a semisimple ring. Semiprimitive rings can be understood as subdirect products of primitive rings, which are described by the Jacobson density theorem.

==Definition==
A ring is called semiprimitive or Jacobson semisimple if its Jacobson radical is the zero ideal.

A ring is semiprimitive if and only if it has a faithful semisimple left module. The semiprimitive property is left-right symmetric, and so a ring is semiprimitive if and only if it has a faithful semisimple right module.

A ring is semiprimitive if and only if it is a subdirect product of left primitive rings.

A commutative ring is semiprimitive if and only if it is a subdirect product of fields, .

A left artinian ring is semiprimitive if and only if it is semisimple, . Such rings are sometimes called semisimple Artinian, .

==Examples==

* The ring of integers is semiprimitive, but not semisimple.
* Every primitive ring is semiprimitive.
* The product of two fields is semiprimitive but not primitive.
* Every von Neumann regular ring is semiprimitive.

Jacobson himself has defined a ring to be &quot;semisimple&quot; if and only if it is a subdirect product of simple rings, . However, this is a stricter notion, since the endomorphism ring of a countably infinite dimensional vector space is semiprimitive, but not a subdirect product of simple rings, .

<text>In the branch of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a left primitive ring is a ring which has a faithful simple left module. Well known examples include endomorphism rings of vector spaces and Weyl algebras over fields of characteristic zero.

== Definition ==
A ring &quot;R&quot; is said to be a left primitive ring if it has a faithful simple left &quot;R&quot;-module. A right primitive ring is defined similarly with right &quot;R&quot;-modules. There are rings which are primitive on one side but not on the other. The first example was constructed by George M. Bergman in . Another example found by Jategaonkar showing the distinction can be found in .

An internal characterization of left primitive rings is as follows: a ring is left primitive if and only if there is a maximal left ideal containing no nonzero two-sided ideals. The analogous definition for right primitive rings is also valid.

The structure of left primitive rings is completely determined by the Jacobson density theorem: A ring is left primitive if and only if it is isomorphic to a dense subring of the ring of endomorphisms of a left vector space over a division ring.

Another equivalent definition states that a ring is left primitive if and only if it is a prime ring with a faithful left module of finite length (, Ex. 11.19, p. 191).

==Properties==
One-sided primitive rings are both semiprimitive rings and prime rings. Since the product ring of two or more nonzero rings is not prime, it is clear that the product of primitive rings is never primitive. 

For a left Artinian ring, it is known that the conditions &quot;left primitive&quot;, &quot;right primitive&quot;, &quot;prime&quot;, and &quot;simple&quot; are all equivalent, and in this case it is a semisimple ring isomorphic to a square matrix ring over a division ring. More generally, in any ring with a minimal one sided ideal, &quot;left primitive&quot; = &quot;right primitive&quot; = &quot;prime&quot;.

A commutative ring is left primitive if and only if it is a field.

Being left primitive is a Morita invariant property.

== Examples ==
Every simple ring &quot;R&quot; with unity is both left and right primitive. (However, a simple non-unital ring may not be primitive.) This follows from the fact that &quot;R&quot; has a maximal left ideal &quot;M&quot;, and the fact that the quotient module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a simple left &quot;R&quot;-module, and that its annihilator is a proper two-sided ideal in &quot;R&quot;. Since &quot;R&quot; is a simple ring, this annihilator is {0} and therefore &quot;R&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a faithful left &quot;R&quot;-module.

Weyl algebras over fields of characteristic zero are primitive, and since they are domains, they are examples without minimal one-sided ideals.

===Full linear rings===
A special case of primitive rings is that of &quot;full linear rings&quot;. A left full linear ring is the ring of &quot;all&quot; linear transformations of an infinite-dimensional left vector space over a division ring. (A right full linear ring differs by using a right vector space instead.) In symbols, formula_1 where &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over a division ring &quot;D&quot;. It is known that &quot;R&quot; is a left full linear ring if and only if &quot;R&quot; is von Neumann regular, left self-injective with socle soc(&quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;) ≠ {0}. Through linear algebra arguments, it can be shown that formula_2 is isomorphic to the ring of row finite matrices formula_3, where &quot;I&quot; is an index set whose size is the dimension of &quot;V&quot; over &quot;D&quot;. Likewise right full linear rings can be realized as column finite matrices over &quot;D&quot;.

Using this we can see that there are non-simple left primitive rings. By the Jacobson Density characterization, a left full linear ring &quot;R&quot; is always left primitive. When dim&quot;D&quot;&quot;V&quot; is finite &quot;R&quot; is a square matrix ring over &quot;D&quot;, but when dim&quot;D&quot;&quot;V&quot; is infinite, the set of finite rank linear transformations is a proper two-sided ideal of &quot;R&quot;, and hence &quot;R&quot; is not simple.

<text>The Dornier Do J &quot;Wal&quot; (&quot;whale&quot;) is a twin-engine German flying boat of the 1920s designed by &quot;Dornier Flugzeugwerke&quot;. The Do J was designated the Do 16 by the Reich Air Ministry (&quot;RLM&quot;) under its aircraft designation system of 1933.

==Design and development==
The Do J had a high-mounted strut-braced parasol wing with two piston engines mounted in tandem in a central nacelle above the wing; one engine drove a tractor and the other drove a pusher propeller. The hull made use of Claudius Dornier&#x27;s patented sponsons on the hull&#x27;s sides, first pioneered with the earlier, Dornier-designed Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV flying boat late in World War I. The Do J made its maiden flight on 6 November 1922. The flight, as well as most production until 1932, took place in Italy because of the restrictions on aviation in Germany after World War I under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Dornier began to produce the &quot;Wal&quot; in Germany in 1931; production went on until 1936.

In the military version (&quot;Militärwal&quot; in German), a crew of two to four rode in an open cockpit near the nose of the hull. There was one machine gun position in the bow in front of the cockpit and one or two amidships. Beginning with Spain, military versions were delivered to Argentina, Chile and the Netherlands for use in their colonies; examples were also sent to Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and to the end of production Italy and Germany. The main military users, Spain and the Netherlands, manufactured their own versions under licence. Several countries, notably Italy, Norway, Portugal, Uruguay and Germany, employed the &quot;Wal&quot; for military tasks.

The civil version (&quot;Kabinenwal&quot; or &quot;Verkehrswal&quot;) had a cabin in the nose, offering space for up to 12 passengers, while the open cockpit was moved further aft. Main users of this version were Germany, Italy, Brazil and Colombia.

The Do J was first powered by two 265 kW (355 hp) Rolls-Royce Eagle IX engines. Later versions used nearly every available engine on the market from makers like Hispano-Suiza, Napier &amp; Son, Lorraine-Dietrich, BMW, and even the US-built Liberty V-12 engine. The &quot;10 to-Wal&quot; used by &quot;Deutsche Lufthansa&quot; for their mail service across the South Atlantic from 1934 to 1938 had a range of , and a ceiling of 3,500 m (11,480 ft).

Over 250 &quot;Wals&quot; were built by CMASA and Piaggio in Italy, CASA in Spain, Kawasaki in Japan, Aviolanda in the Netherlands and Dornier in Germany.

Numerous airlines operated &quot;Wals&quot; on scheduled passenger and mail services with great success. The source Robert L. Gandt, in 1991, (pages 47–48) lists the following carriers: SANA and Aero Espresso of Italy; Aero Lloyd and Deutsche Luft Hansa of Germany; SCADTA of Colombia; Syndicato Condor of Brazil; Nihon Koku Yuso Kaisha of Japan. According to &quot;Nicolaou, 1996&quot; the Dornier &quot;Wal&quot; was &quot;easily the greatest commercial success in the history of marine aviation&quot;.

The Colombian Air Force used &quot;Wals&quot; in the Colombia–Peru War in 1932–1933.

The Dornier Do 18 was a completely updated successor to the Wal but shared little more than the general configuration.

===Pioneering flights===
The Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen accompanied by Lincoln Ellsworth, pilot Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, and three other team members used two Dornier seaplanes in his unsuccessful attempt to reach the North Pole in 1925. His two aircraft, &quot;N-24&quot; and &quot;N-25&quot;, landed at 87° 44&#x27; north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by any aircraft up to that time. The planes landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. One of the aircraft, the N-24, was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for over three weeks to prepare an airstrip to take off from the ice. They shoveled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (454 g) of daily food rations. In the end, six crew members were packed into the N-25. Riiser-Larsen took off, and they barely became airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphantly after widely being presumed dead.

On 18 August 1930, Wolfgang von Gronau started on a transatlantic flight in the same Dornier &quot;Wal&quot; (D-1422) Amundsen had flown, establishing the northern air route over the Atlantic, flying from Sylt (Germany)-Iceland-Greenland-Labrador-New York ) in 47 flight hours. In 1932 von Gronau flew a Dornier &quot;Wal&quot; (D-2053) called the &quot;Grönland Wal&quot; (Greenland Whale) on a round-the-world flight.

In 1926 the captain Ramón Franco became a national Spanish hero when he piloted the &quot;Plus Ultra&quot; on a trans-Atlantic flight, following the route pioneered by Portuguese aviators Sacadura Cabral and Gago Coutinho in the first flight across the South Atlantic in 1922. His co-pilot was Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz; the other crew members were Teniente de Navio (Navy Lieutenant) Juan Manuel Duran and the mechanic Pablo Rada. The &quot;Plus Ultra&quot; departed from Palos de la Frontera, in the Province of Huelva, Spain, on 22 January and arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 26 January. It stopped over at Gran Canaria, Cape Verde, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo. The journey was completed in 59 hours and 39 minutes.

The event appeared in most major newspapers worldwide, although some of them underlined the fact that the airplane itself, plus the technical expertise were foreign. Throughout the Spanish-speaking world, the Spanish aviators were wildly acclaimed, particularly in Argentina and Spain where thousands gathered at Plaza de Colón in Madrid.

In 1929 Franco attempted another trans-Atlantic flight, this time crashing the airplane in the sea near the Azores. The crew was rescued days later by the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; of the British Royal Navy.

The Portuguese military aviator major Sarmento de Beires and his crew (captain Jorge de Castilho as navigator and lieutenant Manuel Gouveia as flight engineer) made the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by night in a Dornier J named &quot;Argos&quot;. The crossing was made on the night of the 16 to 17 March 1927, from the Bijagós Archipelago in Portuguese Guinea to Fernando de Noronha island in Brazil.

Two Dornier &quot;Wals&quot; (D-ALOX &quot;Passat&quot; and D-AKER &quot;Boreas&quot;) also played an important role in the Third German Antarctic Expedition of 1939.

===South Atlantic air mail===
The biggest and last versions of the &quot;Wal&quot;, the eight and ten tonne variants (both versions also known as &quot;Katapultwal&quot; ), were operated by &quot;Lufthansa&quot; on their South Atlantic airmail service from Stuttgart, Germany to Natal, Brazil. On route proving flights in 1933, and a scheduled service beginning in February 1934, &quot;Wals&quot; flew the trans-ocean stage of the route, between Bathurst, the Gambia in West Africa and Fernando de Noronha, an island group off South America. At first, there was a refueling stop in mid-ocean. The flying boat would land on the open sea, near a converted merchant ship. This vessel was equipped with a &quot;towed sail&quot; onto which the aircraft taxied. From there it was winched aboard by a crane, refueled, and then launched by catapult back into the air. However, landing on the big ocean swells tended to damage the hull of the flying boats, especially the smaller &quot;8-tonne Wal&quot;. From September 1934 a second merchantman was available, so that &quot;Lufthansa&quot; now had a support ship at each end of the trans-ocean stage, providing radio navigation signals and catapult launchings. When they did not have to take off from the water under their own power, the flying boats could carry more fuel. Once the incoming mail from Europe had arrived in West Africa (also by &quot;Wal&quot; from the Canary Islands), the support ship would steam out to sea in the direction of South America for 36 hours before using its catapult to launch the airplane. On the return trip a &quot;Wal&quot; would fly the stage from Natal to Fernando de Noronha, and then be carried out to sea overnight. The same airplane was then catapulted off to fly to West Africa the following morning, &quot;i.e.&quot;, after twelve hours travel on the ship. From April 1935 the ships no longer carried the flying boats out to sea. The &quot;Wal&quot; was launched offshore, and flew the entire distance across the ocean. This cut the time it took for mail to get from Germany to Brazil from four days down to three.

The first ship converted to a mid-Atlantic refueling stop was the &quot;SS Westfalen&quot;, a freight and passenger liner that became out-dated for carrying mail and passengers shortly after World War I due to its small size and low cruising speed. The second vessel was the MS &quot;Schwabenland&quot;. In 1936 a new support ship went into service, the MS &quot;Ostmark&quot;, which Lufthansa had purpose-built as a seaplane tender.

&quot;Wals&quot; made over 300 crossings of the South Atlantic in regular mail service (Gandt, 1991, pages 47–48). The &quot;8-tonne Wal&quot; was not a success, only two being built. The six &quot;10-tonne Wals&quot; flew the South Atlantic from 1934 until late 1938, although aircraft of more recent design began replacing them from 1937.

From 1925 the French airline &quot;Compagnie Générale Aéropostale&quot; operated an airmail service on much the same route, from France to Brazil. The mail was flown only as far as Dakar in Senegal, West Africa, and then shipped across the South Atlantic to Natal aboard converted destroyers. The ocean crossing alone took five days, the whole trip eight days. From 1930 &quot;Aéropostale&quot; began trying to make the ocean crossing by air, but kept losing planes and crews and suffered from a lack of political support. &quot;Air France&quot;, of which &quot;Aéropostale&quot; had become a part, only began operating an &quot;all air&quot; service between Europe and South America in January 1936, nearly two years after &quot;Lufthansa&quot;. That the Germans had succeeded in establishing the world&#x27;s first regular intercontinental airline service before their competition was due, in no small part, to the sturdy and seaworthy &quot;Wal&quot; and its reliable BMW engines.

<text>SR (short for Synchronizing Resources) is a programming language designed for concurrent programming.

&quot;Resources&quot; encapsulate processes and the variables they share, and can be separately compiled. &quot;Operations&quot; provide the primary mechanism for process interaction.

SR provides a novel integration of the mechanisms for invoking and servicing operations. Consequently, it supports local and remote procedure call, rendezvous, message passing, dynamic process creation, multicast, semaphores and shared memory.

Version 2.2 has been ported to the Apollo, DECstation, Data General AViiON, HP 9000 Series 300, Multimax, NeXT, PA-RISC, RS/6000, Sequent Symmetry, SGI IRIS, Sun-3, Sun-4 and others.

<text>The National Gallery of Canada (), located in the capital city of Ottawa, Ontario, is Canada&#x27;s national art museum. The museum&#x27;s building takes up , with of space used for exhibiting art. It is one of the largest art museums in North America by exhibition space.

The institution was established in 1880 at the Second Supreme Court of Canada building, and moved to the Victoria Memorial Museum building in 1911. In 1913, the Government of Canada passed the &quot;National Gallery Act&quot;, formally outlining the institution&#x27;s mandate as a national art museum. The Gallery was moved to the Lorne Building in 1960.

In 1988, the Gallery was relocated to a new building designed for this purpose. The National Gallery of Canada is situated in a glass and granite building on Sussex Drive, with a notable view of Canada&#x27;s Parliament Buildings on Parliament Hill. The building was designed by Israeli architect Moshe Safdie and opened in 1988.

The Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection includes more than 93,000 works by European, American, Asian, Canadian, and Indigenous artists. In addition to exhibiting works from its permanent collection, the Gallery also organizes and hosts a number of travelling exhibitions.

==History==

The Gallery was first formed in 1880 by Canada&#x27;s Governor General, John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll in conjunction with the establishment of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1882, moved into its first home on Parliament Hill, housed in the Second Supreme Court of Canada building.

Eric Brown was named the first director in 1910. In 1911, the Gallery moved to the Victoria Memorial Museum building, sharing it with the National Museum of Natural Sciences. In 1913, the first &quot;National Gallery Act&quot; was passed, outlining the Gallery&#x27;s mandate and resources. During the 1920s, the building was expanded. The art gallery was given four floors, and a separate entrance was created for the art museum. In addition, a firewall was built between the Natural Sciences Museum and the National Gallery. But, the Gallery was still in temporary space in the Victoria Memorial Museum building. Longterm plans were to move it to a new permanent location, with spaces dedicated to the viewing of art.

By the 1950s, the space in the Victoria Memorial Museum building had grown inadequate for the Gallery&#x27;s collections. In 1952, the Gallery launched a design contest for architects to design a permanent home for the gallery. But the Gallery failed to garner support from the government of Louis St. Laurent, resulting in the Gallery having to abandon the winning bid. 

To provide a workable compromise for the National Gallery, St. Laurent&#x27;s government offered the National Gallery the eight-storey Lorne Building for its use. The National Gallery moved into the nondescript office building on Elgin Street. The Lorne Building has since been demolished and replaced by a 17-storey office building to house the Federal Finance Department.

In 1962, Charles Comfort, the Gallery&#x27;s director, was criticized after half of the works on display at an exhibition for Walter Chrysler&#x27;s European works were exposed as forgeries by American journalists. Comfort had allowed the Gallery to host the exhibition, despite being warned about the works by the director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.

The National Museums of Canada Corporation (NMC) absorbed the National Gallery of Canada in 1968. During the 1970s, the NMC diverted funds from the National Gallery to form regional galleries. The Gallery completed renovations to the Lorne Building in 1976. By 1980, it had become apparent that the National Gallery would need to relocate, given the poor condition of the building, historical use of asbestos there, and inadequate exhibition areas that provided only enough space for two per cent of the collection to be exhibited at any given time.

After the Canada&#x27;s &quot;Constitution&quot; was patriated in 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced a shift in policy focus towards the &quot;creation of a nation,&quot; with priority given to the arts in an effort to enrich Canadian identity. In that same year, Minister of Communications Francis Fox declared the government&#x27;s commitment to erect new permanent buildings for its national museums, including the National Gallery, and the Museum of Man within five years. The director of the National Gallery, Jean Sutherland Boggs, was chosen by Trudeau to oversee construction of the National Gallery and museums. The Gallery began construction for its permanent museum building on Sussex Drive in 1985, and was opened in May 1988.

The diversion of funds by the NMC to help fund regional museums was ended in 1982, and the National Museums of Canada formally dissolved in 1987. As a result of this dissolution, the National Gallery reacquired its institutional independence, along with the mandate and powers outlined in its formative legislative act prior to 1968.

The Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (CMCP), formerly the Stills Photography Division of the National Film Board of Canada, was an affiliated institution of the National Gallery, and was established in 1985. In 1988, the CMCP&#x27;s administration was amalgamated with that of the National Gallery&#x27;s. The CMCP later moved to its new location at 1 Rideau Canal, and continued to operate there until its closure in 2006. Its collection was later absorbed into the National Gallery&#x27;s in 2009.

In December 2000, the National Gallery announced it suspected approximately 100 works from its collection was plunder stolen by the Nazis during the Second World War. The Gallery posted images of works suspected of being stolen art online, permitting its last legal owners to examine and possibly lay claim to the works. In 2006, the Gallery returned a painting by Édouard Vuillard that had been looted by the Nazis from Alfred Lindon in 1942, &quot;The Salon of Madame Aron&quot;, to Lindon&#x27;s heirs.

In December 2009, the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Alberta issued a joint press release announcing a three-year partnership, which saw the use of the Art Gallery of Alberta&#x27;s galleries to exhibit works from the National Gallery&#x27;s collection. The program was the first &quot;satellite program&quot; between the National Gallery of Canada, and another institution, with similar initiatives launched at other Canadian art galleries in the following years.

Marc Mayer was named the Gallery&#x27;s director, succeeding Pierre Théberge, on 19 January 2009. On 19 April 2019, he was succeeded by Alexandra Suda, who was appointed the 11th Director and chief executive officer of the National Gallery of Canada. Under Sasha Suda, the Gallery underwent a major re-branding, dubbed Ankosé, to be more inclusive and work towards reconciliation. After only three years, Suda resigned. Angela Cassie was then appointed interim Director and CEO in July 2022.

==Building==

The Gallery&#x27;s present building was designed by Moshe Safdie &amp; Associates, with construction beginning in 1985, and the building opening in 1988. The building has a total floor area of . In 2000, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada chose the National Gallery as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium. The National Gallery of Canada is housed in a building on Sussex Drive, adjacent to the ByWard Market district. The building is the fourth edifice to house the art museum.

An independent Crown corporation, the Canadian Museums Construction Corporation was established to build the Gallery, with a budget of C$185 million. Following the 1984 Canadian federal election, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney dissolved the corporation. However, because the groundwork for the building was already completed, Mulroney chose to continue funding construction for the Gallery, albeit at a reduced total budget of C$162 million.

=== Exterior ===

The building&#x27;s northern, eastern, and western exterior facade is made up of pink-granite walls, or glass-windows. The southern exterior facade features an elongated glass wall, supported by concrete pylons grouped in fours. The profile of the southern facade was designed to mimic a cathedral, with the concrete pylons being used similarly to the flying buttresses found on Gothic cathedrals. The eastern portion of the building&#x27;s southern facade transitions into a low-levelled crystalline glass cupola, which holds the museum&#x27;s main entrance; and its western portion, which features a three-tiered glass cupola.

The three-tiered glass cupola is formed out of rectangular glass and narrow steel supports. The second tier of the cupola is formed out of rectangles and equilateral triangles that are further subdivided into eight or twelve smaller equilateral triangles. All these glass pieces are joined by steel struts. The third tier of the cupola is formed with similar designs, although the triangular glass panes are isosceles triangles. The isosceles triangles converge upwards, with its apexes towards the centre. The building&#x27;s three-tiered cupola is positioned in a manner in which the cupola would be flanked by the Peace Tower and the Library of Parliament to the west when approaching the museum from the east.

=== Interior ===

The interior entrance lobby is floored with pink-granite, and includes a straight wide ramp which slopes upward towards the west. Safdie noted the importance of the ramp in his design, stating that one should &quot;go through some kind of procession to make your way into something as important as the National Gallery,&quot; and that it gave the visitor the feeling of making an ascent to a ritual, a ceremony. The walls of the entrance lobby are lined with rectangular cut pink granite, excluding the southern wall, which is part of the glass-walled exterior facade. A glass and steel ceiling reminiscent of Gothic cathedral architecture, extends the entire way of the ramp. However, as opposed to most Gothic cathedrals, the ceiling has several concrete columns spaced out to support the roof. The summit of the ramp leads towards the Great Hall of the building, situated in the three-storey glass cupola.

The interior courtyard of the building includes the Taiga Garden. The garden was designed by Cornelia Oberlander, who modelled the painting &quot;Terre Sauvage&quot; by A. Y. Jackson; a painting in the National Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection. The garden attempts to mimic the taiga landscape depicted in the painting, the Canadian shield; although limestone is substituted in place of the granite typically found at the Canadian shield.

==Collection==
As of October 2018, the National Gallery of Canada&#x27;s permanent collection holds more than 93,625 works, representing several artistic movements and eras in art history. The Gallery has a large and varied collection of paintings, works on paper, sculptures and photographs. The earliest works acquired by the museum were from Canadian artists, with Canadian art remaining the focus of the institution. However, its collection also includes several works from artists around the world. The Gallery&#x27;s collection has been built up through purchases and donations. The Gallery organizes its own travelling exhibitions to exhibit its collection, travelling across Canada and abroad. The National Gallery is the largest lender of art in Canada, sending out approximately 800 works a year.

The Gallery&#x27;s prints and drawings collection includes 27,000 works on paper, dating from the 15th century to the present day. The prints and drawing collection includes 10,000 works on paper by Canadian artists; more than 800 of these prints and drawings being crafted by Inuit artists. The prints and drawing collection also includes 2,500 drawings and 10,000 prints by American, Asian, and European artists.

The Gallery also has approximately 400 works from Asian artists, dating from 200 CE to the 19th century. The Gallery&#x27;s Asian collection began in the early 20th century, with a number of works originating from the collection of Nasli Heeramaneck. The Gallery also has a collection of photographs. A number of the photographs in the collection originated from the defunct Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography.

Until the mid-1980s, the Gallery&#x27;s mandate did not include collecting art by Indigenous peoples. This has been much critiqued, and led to important changes at the Gallery from the 1980s onwards. Despite a major re-hang in 2003 of the Canadian galleries to include Indigenous art for the first time, the Gallery continues to work towards more equitable representation of Indigenous art, particularly in its historical galleries.

The largest work in the Gallery is the entire interior of the Rideau Street Chapel, which formed part of the Convent of Our Lady Sacred Heart, The interior decorations of the Rideau Street Chapel were designed by Georges Couillon in 1887. The chapel interior was acquired by the Gallery in 1972, when the convent was slated for demolition. The 1,123-piece interior was dismantled, stored and reconstructed within the Gallery as a work of art in 1988.

===Canadian and Indigenous works===
The Gallery&#x27;s Canadian collection includes works dating from the 18th century New France, to the 1990s. The collection includes paintings from pre-Confederation; abstract paintings and other postwar art; and the Henry Birks Collection of Canadian Silver. Early pre-Confederation paintings were among the first items in the Canadian collections, with the National Gallery&#x27;s earliest works originating from Canadian artists at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

The Gallery&#x27;s Canadian collection holds a large number of works by the Group of Seven. The Gallery also holds a large collection of works by Tom Thomson, with &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; added to its collection in 1918. The Gallery also holds the largest collection of works by Alex Colville. Other artists featured in the collection include William Berczy, Jack Bush, Paul-Émile Borduas, Emily Carr, Robert Field, Vera Frenkel, Theophile Hamel, Joseph Légaré, Cornelius Krieghoff, Fernand Leduc, Alexandra Luke, Ken Lum, James Wilson Morrice, John O&#x27;Brien, Antoine Plamondon, William Raphael, Jean-Paul Riopelle, William Ronald, Michael Snow, Lisa Steele, Jeff Wall, Joyce Wieland, Paul Wong, and members of the Regina Five.

In commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Canada in 2017, the Gallery undertook a C$7.4 million renovation to open the Canadian and Indigenous Art: From Time Immemorial to 1967 gallery. This gallery displays the progression of Canadian art and history, exhibiting Canadian and Indigenous works side by side. These works are exhibited in a manner which examines the intertwined relations between the two groups of people.

The Indigenous collection includes works by Indigenous artists around the world, although it has an emphasis on works by the Indigenous peoples of Canada. The Gallery collection acquired its first works by First Nations and Metis artists in the early 20th century. However, the makers of these works were often not acknowledged as Indigenous, because the Gallery&#x27;s mandate did not include the collection of art by Indigenous peoples until the 1980s. The Gallery acquired its first Inuit works in 1956, crafted by artists in Nunavik. The Gallery&#x27;s acquisition of Inuit works, at a time when it was not actively collecting art by other Indigenous peoples, is related to the Government&#x27;s promotion of Inuit art to create jobs in the North and to assert Canadian sovereignty there. In 1979, Henry Birks bequeathed a large collection to NGC consisting primarily of Quebecois pre-confederation silver; this bequest of more than 12,000 objects included around 16 works by Indigenous artists. In 1989 and 1992, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development bequeathed 570 works by Inuit artists.

A number of Indigenous artists whose works are featured in the collection include Kenojuak Ashevak, Kiawak Ashoona, Qaqaq Ashoona, Carl Beam, Faye HeavyShield, Osuitok Ipeelee, Rita Letendre, Norval Morrisseau, Shelley Niro, David Ruben Piqtoukun, Abraham Anghik Ruben, Lucy Tasseor Tutsweetok, Jeffrey Thomas, John Tiktak, and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun.

===Contemporary===

The Gallery&#x27;s contemporary collection includes 1,500 works from artists since the 1990s. The collection features a number of works from Canada and its Indigenous artists. The first Indigenous Canadian contemporary artwork acquired by the National Gallery was purchased in 1987, a piece called &quot;The North American Iceberg&quot; (1985) by Ojibwe artist Carl Beam. In 2017, Bob Rennie donated a contemporary art collection to the National Gallery in honour of Canada&#x27; 150th anniversary. The collection includes 197 paintings, sculptures, and mixed-media pieces with most of it originating from Vancouver-based artists including Geoffrey Farmer, Rodney Graham, Brian Jungen, and Ian Wallace. The Rennie collection also includes some international contemporary works, including from Doris Salcedo.

In 1990 the Gallery bought Barnett Newman&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Fire&quot; for $1.8 million, igniting a storm of controversy. However, since that time its value has appreciated to approximately C$40 million as of 2014. In 1999, the Gallery acquired a sculpture of a giant spider, &quot;Maman&quot;, by Louise Bourgeois for a cost of C$3.2 million. The sculpture was installed on the plaza in front of the Gallery. In 2011 the Gallery installed Canadian sculptor Joe Fafard&#x27;s &quot;Running Horses&quot; next to the Sussex Drive entrance, and American artist Roxy Paine&#x27;s stainless steel sculpture &quot;One Hundred Foot Line&quot; at Kìwekì Point behind the gallery. Other contemporary artists whose works are featured in the National Gallery&#x27;s collection include David Altmejd, Lee Bul, Janet Cardiff, Bharti Kher, Christian Marclay, Elizabeth McIntosh, Chris Ofili, Paine, Ugo Rondinone, and Joanne Tod.

===European, American, and Asian===

The European, American, and Asian collection area includes most of the Gallery&#x27;s works by non-Canadian artists. The Gallery acquired its first European work in 1907: the painting &quot;Ignatius Sancho&quot; by Thomas Gainsborough. Conversely, the Gallery did not begin to develop its collection of American art until the 1970s.

The Gallery&#x27;s collection includes American and European works dating from the Renaissance through the 20th century. In addition to Western art, the collection also has 400 works from India, Nepal, and Tibet.

The Gallery&#x27;s European collection has since expanded either through acquisitions or gifts. Such works include &quot;La Tour Eiffel&quot; by Marc Chagall, acquired by the Gallery in 1956 for $C16,000. In 2018, the Gallery planned to sell the work to fund other acquisitions, but abandoned those plans after the decision was found to be unpopular with the public. In 2005, the Gallery acquired a painting by Italian Renaissance painter Francesco Salviati for $4.5 million. In 2018, the Gallery acquired &quot;The Partie Carée&quot; by James Tissot from the collection of David R. Graham, putting it on display in December 2018. It is the third work by Tissot to be acquired by the museum since 1921. Other works from the collection include &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; by Anglo-American artist Benjamin West. Other artists featured in the museum&#x27;s European collection includes Alejo Fernández, Vilhelm Hammershøi, Gustav Klimt, Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, Henri Matisse, Charles Meynier, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, and Vincent van Gogh.

==Library and archives==
The library and archives of the National Gallery of Canada hold an extensive collection of literature on Canadian art. The library and archives was established alongside the Gallery in 1880, and contains documents on western art from the Late Middle Ages to the present day. The collection includes 275,000 books, exhibition catalogues, and periodicals; 76,000 documentation files; and 95,000 microforms. The archives serves as the institutional archive for the Gallery.

The library and archives&#x27; special collections includes over 50,000 auction catalogues, in addition to 182,000 slides and 360,000 research photographs. The Library and Archives&#x27; Exceptional Materials and Notable Subject Collections contains a number of rare imprints, books, and bookplates on Canadian artists, as well as items relating to historians of Canadian art.

==Management==
The federal government assumed responsibility for the Gallery in 1913, with the enactment of the &quot;National Gallery of Canada Act&quot;. The Gallery became a Crown corporation on 1 July 1990 with the proclamation of the &quot;Museums Act&quot;. The &quot;Museums Act&quot; serves as the museum&#x27;s governing legislation. It empowers a board of trustees to serve as the Gallery&#x27;s governing body, with the board, through the Chair, being accountable to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is ultimately responsible for the Museum. The Director and CEO is charged with the day-to-day management of the Gallery.

The Gallery is affiliated with several associations, including the Canadian Museums Association, the Ontario Association of Art Galleries, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>Air Gabon was the national, state-owned airline of Gabon, operating out of Libreville International Airport to a variety of destinations across western and southern Africa, as well as to Europe.
Founded in 1951, the airline went bankrupt in 2006.

==History==
Air Gabon was founded in 1951 as Compagnie Aerienne Gabonaise operating regional flights out of Libreville using Beechcraft and De Havilland aircraft. It became the national flag carrier in 1968, then renamed Société Nationale Transgabon.

Compagnie Nationale Air Gabon was established in May 1977, after Gabon withdrew from the Air Afrique consortium in December 1976. The new airline was formed from the nucleus of &quot;Société Nationale Transgabon&quot; with the mandate to operate long-haul international services from Libreville. At the time of the airline&#x27;s foundation, the fleet comprised three Fokker F-28s, two Douglas DC-6s, one Douglas DC-4, one de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, and one Sud Aviation Caravelle. Ownership in the airline was shared between the Gabonese government (70%) and Sofepag (30%), an Air France-associated company.

In April 1977, the airline placed an order for a Boeing 747-200 and Boeing 737 at a cost of approximately US$55 million. In 1978 President of Gabon Omar Bongo gave the airline his personal transport, a Fokker F-28, for use on services. On 5 October the airline&#x27;s Boeing 747, named &quot;President Léon M&#x27;ba&quot;, arrived as part of the wet lease agreement signed the previous year. On 26 February 1979 one of the airline&#x27;s Douglas DC-6s crashed into a swamp from Moanda, killing the aircraft&#x27;s three occupants.

The DC-6s and DC-4 were replaced in 1979 by two Vickers Vanguard turboprops, and the airline&#x27;s international route network was expanded to Marseille, Nice, Paris and Rome. Regionally, Air Gabon operated to ten African countries, and served 26 destinations on its domestic network. The airline leased and chartered various single engine aircraft in the early 1980s to operate services to domestic destinations which saw sporadic service, and in 1982 a CASA C-212 Aviocar operated with the airline for a short time. The airline ordered a Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules in 1984 after it was given a loan by the Export-Import Bank, which when delivered in late 1985 replaced the Vickers Vanguards.

In 1986, the airline underwent recapitalisation efforts, which saw the government&#x27;s stake increase to eighty percent, with the French Sofepag&#x27;s share decreasing to twenty percent. In 1989 the airline acquired a Fokker 100 and in 1993 two ATR 72s were ordered to replace the Fokker F28s. The airline commenced services to Johannesburg in South Africa in late 1993. By 1996, the airline had commenced direct services to London with the Boeing 747 Combi, and its international network saw services being operated from Libreville to Abidjan, Bamako, Bangui, Cotonou, Dakar, Douala, Geneva, Kinshasa, Johannesburg, Lagos, Lomé, Malabo, Marseille, Nice, Paris, Pointe-Noire and Rome.

The first flight for the reshaped airline went from Libreville to Lomé and Abidjan. The launch of European services from Libreville followed suit, with the inauguration of a regular flight to Paris (which was later dropped again). By then, the fleet consisted of two Fokker F28s, a Boeing 737-200 and a Boeing 747-200. Air Gabon restored Paris to Libreville flights in December 2004 with its Boeing 767-200, an aircraft type which had been introduced in 1998. In March 2006, Air Gabon was shut down shortly after bankruptcy. Initially, the launch of a new Gabonese national carrier as a joint-venture with Royal Air Maroc under the name Air Gabon International was planned, but has never materialized.

==Fleet==


Over the years, Air Gabon operated the following aircraft types:
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 8 December 1994, at 10:40 local time, an Air Gabon ATR 72 (registered F-OHOC) veered off the runway at Oyem Airport upon landing after a flight from Bitam Airport. Even though the plane hit some trees, there were no fatalities among the 17 passengers and 4 crew members on board.
*On 9 August 1997, an Air Gabon Boeing 727 en route from Franceville to Kigali, Rwanda with more than 100 Rwandan refugees on board who were to be deported, was hijacked by two of the passengers who attacked the pilot twenty minutes after take-off and demanded the plane be diverted to South Africa. Instead, the pilot returned to Franceville, where the perpetrators surrendered to police forces.
*On 19 December 2003, Air Gabon Flight 471, a Boeing 737-300 (registered TR-LFZ) en route from Franceville to Libreville overran the runway upon landing at Libreville International Airport at 18:44 local time, after having circled the airport for 30 minutes due to bad weather. The aircraft crashed through a boundary fence and came to rest a few hundred metres behind the runway threshold. There were no fatalities among the 125 passengers and 6 crew members on board, but the plane was damaged beyond repair.

<text>The 16th century in Canada saw the first contacts, since the Norsemen 500 years earlier, between the indigenous peoples in Canada living near the Atlantic coast and European fishermen, whalers, traders, and explorers.

Following the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and the subsequent voyage to the land that became known as Canada by John Cabot in 1497, Europeans visited the Atlantic coast with increasing frequency. Cabot&#x27;s report of abundant codfish drew European fishermen to the waters near Canada. Most of the visits in the 16th century were unrecorded, although by mid-century the number of European fishing boats and whaling ships visiting Newfoundland, Labrador, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Nova Scotia ran into the hundreds annually. Many of the Europeans came ashore to trade with the indigenous peoples or process their catch.

The tribes of indigenous people living in the area visited by Europeans were the Inuit in Labrador, the Beothuk in Newfoundland, the Micmaq in Nova Scotia and the southern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence Iroquoians along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and Ontario, and the Innu (Montagnais), north of the St. Lawrence River. The tribes of the Wabenaki and Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacies would also play a role in the history of Canada during this century.

The principal resources drawing Europeans to Canada were a seemingly inexhaustible fishery of cod and marine mammals (for oil). Toward the end of the century, trading with indigenous people for furs became important.

==Events: 1500 to 1550==

* 1501: At the direction of the king of Portugal, Gaspar Corte-Real led three caravels to North America, probably sailing along the eastern coast of Newfoundland and possibly to Labrador. Two vessels made it back to Portugal with as many as 49 captured indigenous people, probably Beothuk. Corte-Real and his vessel disappeared, fate unknown.
* 1502. The Cantino World Map was the first map showing the world-wide discoveries of Portugal. The map shows a representation of what is probably Newfoundland with the caption that this land belongs to Portugal.
* c. 1502: A vessel, the &quot;Gabriel&quot;, owned by Bristol merchants returned from North America with three indigenous captives. This vessel (or another one in the same year) may also have brought the first cargo of codfish from the Americas to Europe.
* 1504: Breton and Norman fishermen from France are known to have begun fishing near &quot;New Found Land,&quot; probably on the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland. 
* 1504: Sebastian Cabot, the son of John Cabot, headed a two ship expedition from Bristol to North America and came back to England with a cargo of salted codfish and fish livers. 
* 1504: Portugal imposed tariffs on American codfish imported into the country. 
* 1506: A ship&#x27;s captain, Jean Denys, visited Newfoundland on a fishing expedition. He was from Honfleur in Normandy and was the first Frenchman known to have visited Canada.
* 1508: France sent out an exploratory mission of two ships from the city of Dieppe under the command of Thomas Aubert. He brought back to France seven indigenous captives, the first the French had seen. Aubert named the St. Lawrence River and said he ascended the river for 80 leagues, about . He reported that the country was rich in fur-bearing animals.
* 1508-1509: Sebastian Cabot sailed from Bristol and looked for a Northwest Passage to Asia, possibly entering Hudson Bay before his mutinous crew made him turn back. He then turned south and followed the Atlantic coast to the approximate latitude of Washington, D.C. before returning to England. 
* 1517: Basque fishermen visited Newfoundland for the first time.
* 1520: João Álvares Fagundes sailed to the Americas on behalf of Portugal. He sailed along the south coast of Newfoundland. Some historians believe he founded a short-lived colony on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
* 1523-24: Giovanni da Verrazzano, sailing for France, sailed along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina north to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
* 1529: A large wooden enclosure built in the 1520s at the , Labrador indicates that whaling was underway in the Strait of Belle Isle. 
* 1534: In his first voyage to the Americas, Frenchman Jacques Cartier circled the Gulf of St. Lawrence. On the southern shore of the Gaspe Peninsula near the future town of Carleton-sur-Mer he met a group of 300 Micmaq people who were fishing from canoes. Later, he met a group of more than 200 Iroquoians, men, women, and children on Gaspe Bay. They had travelled in 40 canoes to Gaspé to fish for Atlantic mackerel which abounded in the area. They were more than from their home of Stadacona, on the site of present-day Quebec City. Both the Micmaq and the Iroquoians met the French &quot;very familiarly&quot; probably indicating previous trading contacts with Europeans. Cartier seized two Iroquoians and took them back to France with him.
* 1535-1536: Cartier with three ships and 110 men returned to Canada. He sailed up the St. Lawrence River and reached the St. Lawrence Iroquoian villages of Stadacona and Hochelaga (now Quebec City and Montreal). He was guided by the two Iroquoians he had seized on his previous voyage. Cartier wintered near Stadacona. Twenty-five of his men died of scurvy before the Iroquoians told him that tea made from the needles of the white cedar tree would prevent the disease. After growing conflict, Cartier kidnapped about ten of the Iroquoians, including the leader, Donnacona, and sailed back to France. Cartier told stories in France of the existence of a rich kingdom of Saguenay in the interior of North America.
* 1536: Spanish Basque whaling ventures began at Red Bay in southernmost Labrador on the Strait of Belle Isle. The Basques whaling operation in the 16th century was large, with an average of 15 large and often armed ships and 600 men visiting Red Bay annually during the next 40 years to hunt bowhead and right whales. Bowhead whales migrated through the Strait of Belle Isle beginning in October and right whales in June. Red Bay has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to preserve the remains of the whale oil processing operations at the site.
* 1537: Iron goods in quantity were being traded by Europeans to Indigenous peoples for marten skins in the Strait of Belle Isle. 
* c. 1540: Many thousands of fur skins were being transported from Canada to France each year.
* 1541: Jacques Cartier and Sieur de Roberval led an attempt to colonize Quebec. Cartier left France with five ships and 500 colonists and founded the first French settlement in America, Charlesbourg-Royal, at the mouth of the Rivière du Cap Rouge in what would become Quebec City. However, he encountered problems with the St. Lawrence Iroquoians at Stadacona and in other sites. His account of experiences ends at this point and what happened afterward at Charlesbourg-Royal is unknown.
* 1542: Cartier abandoned Charlesbourg-Royal and set off for France with his remaining ships and men. He met Roberval in Newfoundland and was ordered to turn back to Charlesbourg-Royal, but Cartier defied the order and left secretly for France. Roberval and his three ships continued on to Charlesbourg-Royal where he reestablished the colony. The colony was beset by problems of cold winters, famine, tension with the Iroquoians, and Roberval&#x27;s dictatorial temperament.
* 1542: At Blanc-Sablon in the Strait of Belle Isle, a St. Lawrence Iroquoian chief from Stadacona dined on board a Basque vessel and bragged of killing 35 woodcutters in the settlement established by Cartier. The Spanish Basques and the Iroquoians appear to have forged a partnership against other indigenous people of the region and other European powers. The name &quot;Iroquois&quot; probably derives from a Basque language word, as does the names of several other indigenous peoples in the region.
* 1543: Roberval abandoned his colony at Charlesbourg-Royal and returned to France with all the colonists. The only wealth he had found was fool&#x27;s gold and false diamonds. Cartier&#x27;s and Roberval&#x27;s failures in Canada inspired the proverb &quot;as false as Canadian diamonds.&quot; For the next 50 years, France had no interest in attempting to establish a colony in Canada.

==Events: 1550-1599==
* 1550: Pottery found at the Red Bay Basque whaling station in the Strait of Belle Isle is suggestive of the presence of St. Lawrence Iroquoians at the site, more than from their villages along the St. Lawrence River. An Englishmen visiting the area said that the indigenous people helped the Basques &quot;with great diligence and patience to kill, cut up and boil the whales to make...oil.&quot;
* 1570s: Isolated from the trade in Canada, and also from trade originating from the coast of the future United States, the Mohawk tribe of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy aggressively attacked northward from their homeland along the Mohawk River in New York. Possibly they were assisted by neighbouring Algonquin speaking tribes who contested the control of the St. Lawrence River by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians. Many historians believe that the disappearance of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians by about 1580 was caused by the Mohawk attacks. 
* 1576: With three small ships, Martin Frobisher of England made his first attempt to find a Northwest Passage. He landed in Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, persuaded that he had found a way to the &quot;South Sea&quot; (the Pacific Ocean) and Asia. He came into contact with the Inuit. Five of his men disappeared, apparently captured by the Inuit. Frobisher took an Inuit hostage in retaliation. 
* 1577: With financial support from the Queen of England, Frobisher set out with three vessels and about 150 men for the Americas on his second expedition. He again found his way to Frobisher Bay and spent his time loading his ships with 200 tons of &quot;gold.&quot; He also captured three Inuit and attempted to find the five men he had lost on his previous expedition. Returning to England, his &quot;gold&quot; turned out to be worthless.
* 1578: Frobisher departed England with 15 ships and 400 men with the objective of founding a colony in the Arctic lands he had previously visited. He landed in Greenland and entered the Hudson Strait between the mainland of Canada and Baffin Island which could have led him to a Northwest Passage, but he turned back because of bad weather and ice-clogged waters and returned to England. 
* 1578: Records suggest that 500 French, primarily Breton and Norman, fishing boats were engaged in the Newfoundland fishery. Basque and Portuguese fishing boats may have numbered 200 to 300. English fishing boats numbered about 50. 
* 1579. The English parliament closed all ports to imports of Basque whale oil, effectively ending the Spanish Basque dominance of whaling in Canada. Only five Basque whalers visited North American waters in 1579, down from an average of 30 in the earlier 1570s. Basques, mostly French Basques, continued to be important in Canada for whaling and trade, especially trading for furs. 
* c. 1580. The St. Lawrence Iroquoians disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley, possibly destroyed by warfare, European diseases, or dispersed among other nearby peoples, such as the Huron-Wendat. All these scenarios may have played a role in their disappearance. Their disappearance opened up the Saint Lawrence River valley to European traders, especially the French who would soon be dominant in the region.
* 1583. After being absent for 40 years, the French returned to the St. Lawrence River. Members of the French Basque Hoyarsabal family of Saint-Jean-de-Luz ascended the river and traded and hunted whales at Tadoussac. Jacques Noël also ascended the St. Lawrence to Montreal, the site of the abandoned colony of his uncle, Jacques Cartier, and the St. Lawrence Iroquoian town of Hochelaga. The Iroquoians had disappeared. 
* 1584: Micheau de Hoyarsabal took with him for trade with the indigenous people at Tadoussac 100 copper kettles, 1,921 knives, 50 axes, several swords, a variety of textile products, and glass beads. The most important products traded by the indigenous people were beaver pelts, other valuable furs, and caribou and moose hides. In the late 16th century Tadoussac became an important multi-national trading center with an estimated 100 European ships visiting annually.
* 1585: The Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604) began. England sent ships to the Grand Banks, the Newfoundland expedition led by Bernard Drake, and captured many boats in the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets. The British and French gradually replaced the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen in Canadian waters.
* 1590. Basque fisherman named a place &quot;Pequeña Canada&quot; (Little Canada), located at the mouth of the Saint-Augustin River near the Strait of Belle Isle. The name &quot;Canada&quot; is the Iroquoian word for settlement or village and possibly indicates that some of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians who had disappeared before 1583 had settled at this place.
* 1598: The Marquis de la Roche de Mesgouez was appointed lieutenant-general of Canada by the king of France and established a colony with 50 men, mostly convicts, on Sable Island. The colony lasted until 1603 when it dissolved in chaos. 
* 1599: Samuel de Champlain, who would later establish the first permanent French colony in Canada, set out on his first voyage from France to the Caribbean Sea.

<text>In chemistry, intramolecular describes a process or characteristic limited within the structure of a single molecule, a property or phenomenon limited to the extent of a single molecule.

== Relative rates ==
In intramolecular organic reactions, two reaction sites are contained within a single molecule. This configuration elevates the effective concentration of the reacting partners resulting in high reaction rates. Many intramolecular reactions are observed where the intermolecular version does not take place.

Intramolecular reactions, especially ones leading to the formation of 5- and 6-membered rings, are rapid compared to an analogous intermolecular process. This is largely a consequence of the reduced entropic cost for reaching the transition state of ring formation and the absence of significant strain associated with formation of rings of these sizes. For the formation of different ring sizes via cyclization of substrates of varying tether length, the order of reaction rates (rate constants &quot;kn&quot; for the formation of an &quot;n&quot;-membered ring) is usually &quot;k&quot;5 &gt; &quot;k&quot;6 &gt; &quot;k&quot;3 &gt; &quot;k&quot;7 &gt; &quot;k&quot;4 as shown below for a series of ω-bromoalkylamines. This somewhat complicated rate trend reflects the interplay of these entropic and strain factors:
For the &#x27;small rings&#x27; (&quot;3- and 4- membered&quot;), the slow rates is a consequence of angle strain experienced at the transition state. Although three-membered rings are more strained, formation of aziridine is faster than formation of azetidine due to the proximity of the leaving group and nucleophile in the former, which increases the probability that they would meet in a reactive conformation. The same reasoning holds for the &#x27;unstrained rings&#x27; (&quot;5-, 6-, and 7-membered&quot;). The formation of &#x27;medium-sized rings&#x27; (&quot;8- to 13-membered&quot;) is particularly disfavorable due to a combination of an increasingly unfavorable entropic cost and the additional presence of transannular strain arising from steric interactions across the ring. Finally, for &#x27;large rings&#x27; (&quot;14-membered or higher&quot;), the rate constants level off, as the distance between the leaving group and nucleophile is now so large the reaction is now effectively intermolecular. 

Although the details may change somewhat, the general trends hold for a variety of intramolecular reactions, including radical-mediated and (in some cases) transition metal-catalyzed processes.

== Examples==
Many reactions in organic chemistry can occur in either an intramolecular or intermolecular senses. Some reactions are by definition intramolecular or are only practiced intramolecularly, e.g., 
* Dieckmann condensation of diesters is the intramolecular version of aldol condensation.
* Madelung synthesis of indoles
* Smiles rearrangement
* Hydroacylation is almost invariably practiced intramolecularly to produce ketones.
:RCHO + CH2=CHR&#x27; → RC(O)CH2CH2R&#x27;
* Nazarov cyclization reaction for the synthesis of cyclopentenones
*The Wurtz reaction, involving reductive coupling of alkyl halides, essentially is only useful when conducted intramolecularly. Its utility is illustrated with the synthesis of strained rings: 

Some transformations that are enabled or enhanced intramolecularly. For example, the acyloin condensation of diesters almost uniquely produces 10-membered carbocycles, which are difficult to construct otherwise. Another example is the 2+2 cycloaddition of norbornadiene to give quadricyclane.

==Tools and concepts==
Many tools and concepts have been developed to exploit the advantages of intramolecular cyclizations. For example, installing large substituents exploits the Thorpe-Ingold effect. High dilution reactions suppress intermolecular processes. One set of tools involves tethering as discussed below.

===Tethered intramolecular [2+2] reactions===
Tethered intramolecular [2+2] reactions entail the formation of cyclobutane and cyclobutanone via intramolecular 2+2 photocycloadditions. Tethering ensures formation of a multi-cyclic system.
The length of the tether affects the stereochemical outcome of the [2+2] reaction. Longer tethers tend to generate the &quot;straight&quot; product where the terminal carbon of the alkene is linked to the formula_1-carbon of the enone. When the tether consists only two carbons, the “bent” product is generated where the formula_2-carbon of the enone is connected to the terminal carbon of the alkene.
Tethered [2+2] reactions have been used to synthesize organic compounds with interesting ring systems and topologies. For example, [2+2] photocyclization was used to construct the tricyclic core structure in ginkgolide B.
===Molecular tethers===
Otherwise-intermolecular reactions can be made temporarily intramolecular by linking both reactants by a tether with all the advantages associated to it. Popular choices of tether contain a carbonate ester, boronic ester, silyl ether, or a silyl acetal link (silicon tethers) which are fairly inert in many organic reactions yet can be cleaved by specific reagents. The main hurdle for this strategy to work is selecting the proper length for the tether and making sure reactive groups have an optimal orientation with respect to each other. An examples is a Pauson–Khand reaction of an alkene and an alkyne tethered together via a silyl ether.

In this particular reaction, the tether angle bringing the reactive groups together is effectively reduced by placing isopropyl groups on the silicon atom via the Thorpe–Ingold effect. No reaction takes place when these bulky groups are replaced by smaller methyl groups. Another example is a photochemical [2+2]cycloaddition with two alkene groups tethered through a silicon acetal group (racemic, the other enantiomer not depicted), which is subsequently cleaved by TBAF yielding the endo-diol.

Without the tether, the exo isomer forms.

<doc id="485903" wikidata="Q3621268" url="?curid=485903" title="Navel orange">
<text>The navel orange is a variety of orange with a characteristic second fruit at the apex, which protrudes slightly like a human navel. This variety first was caused by a mutation in an orange tree, and first appeared in the early 19th century at a monastery in Bahia, Brazil. The mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base, opposite the stem, embedded within the peel of the primary orange. This mutation also caused it to be seedless, meaning the only way the plant can be propagated is by cutting and grafting.

Navel oranges are mainly an eating fruit because they are seedless and their thicker skin makes them easy to peel. They are also less suitable for juice than other orange varieties as they are less juicy, and because their flesh contains limonin, which becomes bitter when exposed to air.

==History==
The navel orange originated in Bahia, Brazil in the 1810s or 1820s. This variety was likely the Portuguese navel orange or &quot;Umbigo&quot; described by Antoine Risso and Pierre Antoine Poiteau in their 1818–1822 book &quot;Histoire naturelle des orangers&quot; (&quot;Natural History of Orange Trees&quot;). Because of the perceived superiority of this new cultivar, the orange was introduced to Australia in 1824 and Florida in 1835.

In the 1870s, the newly formed United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) imported twelve navel orange trees from Brazil to Washington, D.C.. Two of these cuttings were sent to Eliza Tibbets in 1873, who planted them in Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as &quot;Washington&quot;.

The Cara Cara is a type of navel orange grown mainly in Venezuela, South Africa and California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley. It is sweet and low in acid, with distinctively pinkish red flesh. It was discovered at the Hacienda Cara Cara in Valencia, Venezuela, in 1976.

<text>Events from the 1600s in Canada.

==Events==

* c. 1600 - Approximately 250,000 First Nations and Inuit (Eskimo) inhabit what is now Canada.
* May 26, 1603 - After being dispatched by the King of France, Samuel de Champlain drops anchor in Tadoussac in what would become the province of Quebec.
* June 22, 1603 - Champlain travelled up the St. Lawrence River to Ile d&#x27;Orleans near Stadcona, which would later become Quebec City.
* May 8, 1604 - Sieur de Mons and Champlain, along with 120 settlers, sail from France and anchor in an Acadian (later Nova Scotia) cove. After exploring the coast down to what is now Maine, they decide to settle at Saint Croix Island for the winter. By the spring of 1605, thirty-five of the settlers had died. Of the eighty or so remaining settlers, only eleven were considered to be in good physical condition.
* 1605 - Champlain and his group move from Saint Croix Island to Port Royal, Nova Scotia on the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia (later to be named Annapolis Royal by the British), and establish Canada&#x27;s first permanent settlement.
* 1606: Mattieu da Costa travels with the Champlain expedition to Port Royal. He serves as an interpreter between the French and the Micmac Indians of the area.
* July 1606 - Fifty additional settlers (all male) were brought to Port Royal by Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt.
* 1605-07: The Europeans are welcomed by Mi&#x27;kmaq Grand Chief Membertou, who converts to Catholicism, makes a wampum-belt treaty with the Vatican.
* August 1607 - Despite demonstrating that a settlement in Canada could be successful, the colonists were ordered by the King to abandon Port Royal and head back to France.
* June / July 1608 - Champlain returns to Tadoussac before finally heading to Quebec City and reestablishing a permanent settlement in Canada. Étienne Brûlé and Nicolas Marsolet were a part of this voyage.
* Summer / Fall 1608 - In order to protect the colony from the coming winter, Champlain built a large storehouse and accommodation building called l&#x27;habitation. The pace that Champlain demanded for construction caused a mutiny that resulted in the ringleader being hanged and beheaded.
* 1609 - Champlain allies himself with the Algonquians and with the Hurons, who are amenable to missionary activities and acts as the principal suppliers of furs. This alliance, however, antagonizes the Iroquoian Confederacy, traditional rivals of the Huron and suppliers of furs to the Dutch in New Amsterdam.
* July 30, 1609 - Accompanied by sixty Algonquin warriors, Champlain heads up what is now the Richelieu River and encounters a Mohawk war party. Having the advantage of long guns on their side, Champlain and his side quickly gained victory
* 1609: Champlain supports the Algonquins against the Iroquois at Lake Champlain. He fires on the Iroquois, setting a pattern of Indian relationships.

<doc id="485912" wikidata="Q2853420" url="?curid=485912" title="Asparagus (genus)">
<text>Asparagus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Asparagoideae. It comprises up to 300 species. Most are evergreen long-lived perennial plants growing from the understory as lianas, bushes or climbing plants. The best-known species is the edible &quot;Asparagus officinalis&quot;, commonly referred to as just &quot;asparagus&quot;. Some other members of the genus, such as &quot;Asparagus densiflorus&quot;, are grown as ornamental plants.

==Ecology==
The genus includes a variety of extant forms, occurring from rainforest to semi-desert habitats; many are climbing plants. Most are dispersed by birds.

Ornamental species such as &quot;Asparagus aethiopicus&quot;, &quot;Asparagus setaceus&quot; (syn. &quot;Asparagus plumosus&quot;), and &quot;Asparagus virgatus&quot; are finely branched and are misleadingly known as &quot;asparagus fern&quot;.

In the Macaronesian Islands, several species (such as &quot;Asparagus umbellatus&quot; and &quot;Asparagus scoparius&quot;) grow in moist laurel forest habitat, and preserve the original form of a leafy vine. In the drier Mediterranean climate the asparagus genus evolved in the Tertiary into thorny, drought-adapted species. Root tubers are storage organs developed by &quot;Asparagus&quot; species and are a valuable source of moisture and nutrition for species growing under drought conditions. 

Approximately 27% of &quot;Asparagus&quot; species are dioecious and genomic and biogeographic analysis of the genus supports two independent clade-specific transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy; both events occurred between three to four million years ago in Eurasia and the Mediterranean Basin. 

Many species, particularly from Africa, were once included in separate genera such as Protasparagus and Myrsiphyllum. However, partly in response to the implications of the discovery of new species, those genera have been reunited under &quot;Asparagus&quot;. Species in this genus vary in their appearance, from unarmed herbs to wiry, woody climbers with formidable hooked spines that earn them vernacular names such as &quot;cat thorn&quot; and &quot;wag &#x27;n bietjie&quot; (literally &quot;wait a bit&quot;). Most species have photosynthetic flattened stems, called phylloclades, instead of true leaves. &quot;Asparagus officinalis&quot;, &quot;Asparagus schoberioides&quot;, and &quot;Asparagus cochinchinensis&quot; are dioecious species, with male and female flowers on separate plants.

==Invasive species==
&quot;A. asparagoides&quot;, known as bridal creeper, is a problematic weed in southern Australia.

&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;, &quot;A. scandens&quot; and &quot;A. setaceus&quot; are considered potentially destructive in California, growing as the result of escaped seeds; all can still be purchased at major and local garden centers. All three have the ability to completely overtake other, unrelated plants in their immediate surroundings, often climbing up the larger ones and strangling them, eventually cutting off the plant&#x27;s flow of energy and nutrients. Birds are attracted to the red berries after blooming, thus transporting their seeds.

&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;, &quot;A. aethiopicus&quot; (under the name &quot;A. densiflorus&quot;) and &quot;A. scandens&quot; are listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord since they are invasive plants.

&quot;A. setaceus&quot; is officially recognized as an invasive species in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.

<text>Roy Stanley Geiger (January 25, 1885 – January 23, 1947) was a United States Marine Corps four-star general who served in World War I and World War II. In World War II, he became the first Marine Corps general to lead a field army.

Geiger commanded the III Amphibious Corps in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 before assuming the command of the U.S. Tenth Army upon the combat death of its commander, Lt. General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. Geiger successfully led the Tenth Army until relieved by General Joseph Stilwell.

==Early life==
Geiger was born in Middleburg, Florida.

== Education ==
Geiger attended Florida State Normal and Industrial College. In 1907, Geiger earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from Stetson University College of Law.

Geiger enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private on November 2, 1907, in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was sent to Naval Station Norfolk for his initial training. Geiger spent most of his enlisted time at the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., where he was also promoted to corporal on June 2, 1908. Following a series of professional examinations and the passing of a Naval Medical Board he accepted his commission as a second lieutenant on February 5, 1909.

==U.S. Marine Corps career==
Following attendance at the Marine Officers&#x27; School at Port Royal, South Carolina, he served as a member of the Marine detachments aboard and . In August 1912, he was assigned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the bombardment, assault and capture of the hills called Coyotepe and Barranca. Further foreign shore duty followed in the Philippines and China with the First Brigade and with the Marine detachment, American Legation, Peking, China, from 1913 to 1916.

In March 1916, Geiger joined Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, as a student naval aviator. He successfully completed the course and was designated a naval aviator in June 1917. He was designated Naval Aviator # 49 (Marine Corps Aviator # 5) on June 9, 1917.

===World War I===
Further training followed and in July 1918, he arrived in France. He served with 5 Group, Royal Air Force at Dunkirk. He commanded a squadron of the First Marine Aviation Force and was attached to the Day Wing, Northern Bombing Group. He was detached to the United States in January 1919. For distinguished service in leading bombing raids against the enemy, he was awarded the Navy Cross.

===Development of Marine Corps aviation between the wars===
From December 1919 to January 1921, he was a squadron commander with the Marine Aviation Force attached to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in Haiti. Upon return to the United States and after duty at the Marine Flying Field, Marine Barracks, MCB Quantico, Virginia, he attended Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He graduated in June 1925. Again he went to foreign shore duty, commanding Observation Squadron Two with the First Brigade in Haiti.

In August 1927, he returned to Quantico as a squadron officer and instructor at the Marine Corps Schools, and in May 1928, was assigned to duty in the Aviation Section, Division of Operations and Training, at Marine Corps Headquarters. After attending the U.S. Army War College and graduating in June 1929, he was ordered to Quantico, where he was assigned duty as commanding officer, Aircraft Squadrons, East Coast Expeditionary Force. He returned to Washington and served as the officer in charge, Marine Corps Aviation from 1931 to 1935, a billet currently held by a lieutenant general that is now known as the deputy commandant for aviation.

In June 1935, he returned to Quantico as commanding officer, Aircraft One, Fleet Marine Force. From June 1939 to March 1941, he was a student at the Senior and the Advanced Courses, Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island. This was followed with a brief tour of duty in the Office of the Naval Attaché, London.

===World War II===
In April 1941, Geiger made his way from Lisbon to Gibraltar, where he changed from civilian clothes to his military uniform. He had lunch with the governor at Government House, in a visit which lifted British morale in Gibraltar. He was on his way to the Western Desert, as the first U.S. military observer attached to the British 8th Army. In August, he became commanding general, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, in which capacity he was found upon the United States&#x27; entry into World War II.

On September 3, 1942, he was stationed at Guadalcanal to lead the Cactus Air Force during the early part of the Guadalcanal Campaign. Until November 4, he was commander of the combined Army, Navy and Marines Air Forces stationed here, of which the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing was part. He was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Navy Cross for his service on Guadalcanal.

His citation reads in part, &quot;Despite almost continuous bombardment by enemy aircraft, hostile naval gunfire and shore based artillery, the combined total of Army, Navy and Marine Corps units stationed at Guadalcanal under Major General Geiger&#x27;s efficiently coordinated command succeeded in shooting down 268 Japanese planes in aerial combat and inflicting damage on a number estimated to be as great ... Sank six enemy vessels, including one heavy cruiser, possibly sank three destroyers and one heavy cruiser, and damaged 18 other ships, including one heavy cruiser and five light cruisers.&quot;

Geiger was recalled to Headquarters Marine Corps in May 1943, to become the Director of Aviation. In November 1943, he returned to the field, this time as commanding general of the I Amphibious Corps and led the corps from November 9, to December 15, 1943, in the Battle of Bougainville, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

Redesignated III Amphibious Corps in April 1944, he led this organization in the invasion and subsequent recapture of Guam during July and August 1944, and in the assault and capture of the southern Palau Islands in September and October of the same year. For those operations he was awarded two Gold Stars in lieu of a second and third Distinguished Service Medal.

Geiger led this corps into action for the fourth time as part of the Tenth Army in the invasion and capture of Okinawa. On June 18, 1945, Geiger assumed command of the Tenth Army following the death in combat of Lt. General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. for the final five days of the battle. He was relieved by General Joseph Stilwell. To this day, Geiger remains the only Marine Corps officer to have ever held command of a field army. Geiger was appointed commanding general of the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific in July 1945 and was promoted to lieutenant general. Geiger was the only Marine Corps representative at the surrender of Japan aboard the on September 2, 1945.
He returned to Washington, D.C., and Pensacola, Florida, in September and October 1945 before resuming his duties. Geiger was transferred to Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps in November 1946.

Geiger was promoted to four-star general posthumously by the 80th Congress to be effective from January 23, 1947.

<text>Events from the 1640s in Canada.

==Events==
* c. 1640: Beavers and otters nearly exterminated in Iroquois country. To expand territory, Iroquois launch decades-long &quot;Beaver Wars&quot; against Huron and Algonquin.
* 1640: Françoise Marie Jacqueline, youthful daughter of a physician from Nogent, France, sets sail for what would become Saint John, New Brunswick, to wed Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, Governor of Acadia, and to assume many roles, including wife, confidant, soldier, and businesswoman. In spite of the ongoing and escalating conflict between LaTour and his well-connected rival Governor, Charles de Menou, Sieur d&#x27;Aulnay, she would elevate LaTour&#x27;s status amongst the power brokers of the day in France and in the growing English colonies to the south. In 1645, she would successfully defend Fort LaTour against a vicious attack by d&#x27;Aulnay, only to be betrayed, ultimately losing her life. Buried in the vicinity of the fort, in what is now downtown Saint John, her bones have never been found. Remains of the fort still exist, protected as a national heritage site, hidden beneath layers of ancient soil.
* 17 May 1642: The trade settlement at Montreal is founded by the Sieur de Maisonneuve.
* 5 January 1643: The first Mount Royal Cross erected
* 1644: Second Powhatan Confederacy uprising against Jamestown, Virginia; its leader, Opechancanough, dies in captivity.
* 1644 Jeanne Mance (Baptized Langres, France 12 November 1606 Died 18 June 1673) opens Hotel-Dieu, the first hospital in North America.
* 1645-63: Under the proprietorship of Richelieu&#x27;s company&#x27;s colonial agent, the Community of Habitants, the new French colony takes shape along the St. Lawrence.
* 1648-49: After the Iroquois brutally ravage Huron country and disperse the Huron nation north of the St. Lawrence, they turn against New France itself. 
* 1649-64: the Beaver Wars: Encouraged by the English, and the need for more beaver for trade (their own area being hunted out), Haudenosee (Iroquois) make war on Hurons (1649), Tobaccos (1649), Neutrals (1650–51), Erie (1653–56), Ottawa (1660), Illinois and Miami (1680–84), and members of the Mahican confederation. English, pleased with this, agree to 2-Row Wampum Peace treaty, 1680. 
* 1649: Attacks by the Iroquois disperse the Huron; disrupts fur trade over the next fifteen years. 
* 16 March 1649: The Jesuit father Jean de Brébeuf is martyred during Iroquois raids on the Hurons at St-Ignace. 
* 16 June 1649: The Jesuit missionaries at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons abandon the mission, burning it to the ground and taking refuge at Christian Island.

<text>Events from the 1670s in Canada.

==Events==
* 2 May 1670: Charles II (England) charters Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in London. Underwritten by a group of English merchants, HBC is granted trade rights over Rupert&#x27;s Land—i.e., all territory draining into Hudson Bay. No treaties or compensation to the First Nations there (mostly Ojibwe, Cree peoples) until the late 19th and early 20th centuries; no treaties ever made on large expanse east of Bay.
* 1671-84: HBC Forts at mouths of Bay rivers: Moose 1671; Severn 1680; Albany 1683; York, finally on Hayes.
*June 14, 1671 - At Sault Ste. Marie, four Jesuit priests led by Father Claude-Jean Allouez representing the Roman Catholic Church, and Simon Francois Daumont, Sieur de St. Lusson held aloft a sword and a symbolic tuft of sod, and declared to the indigenous First Nations peoples that all of the Great Lakes country was henceforth a possession of King Louis XIV of France.
* 1672: Colonial postal officials employ Aboriginal couriers to carry mail between New York City and Albany; winter weather is too severe for white couriers.
* 1672: Comte de Frontenac becomes governor general of New France, later quarrelling frequently with the intendant and the bishop.
* 1673: The explorations of Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette lead to the discovery of the Mississippi River.
* 1674: Laval becomes the first bishop of Quebec.
* 1675-76: Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion—Third major war between Virginia settlers and Virginia and Maryland Native Americans. Bacon&#x27;s army kills and enslaves Susquehannock, Occaneechi, Appomatuck, Manakin, members of Powhattan Confederacy. Bacon leads brief rebellion against English Crown authority when his English military murderer commission is rescinded because of excessive brutalities.
* 1675-76: Metacom&#x27;s (King Philip&#x27;s) War against the New England Confederation of colonies - Wampanoag, later joined by Abenaki, Nipmucs and Narragansetts. Mohawks stay neutral; Mohegans, Pequots, Niantics, and Massachusetts tribes back the English. Metacom loses. English government executes Metacom in 1676, nails body parts to town hall, sells wife, children, followers to plantation slavery.
* 1675: The population of New France is almost 8,000.
* 1676: West Country merchants attempt to enforce restrictions on settlement in Newfoundland.
* 1678: Louis Hennepin is the first European to see Niagara Falls.
* 1678-79: Daniel Greysolon Duluth of France explores Great Lakes and negotiates treaties between the warring Ojibwa and Sioux.

<text>Physiological psychology is a subdivision of behavioral neuroscience (biological psychology) that studies the neural mechanisms of perception and behavior through direct manipulation of the brains of nonhuman animal subjects in controlled experiments. This field of psychology takes an empirical and practical approach when studying the brain and human behavior. Most scientists in this field believe that the mind is a phenomenon that stems from the nervous system. By studying and gaining knowledge about the mechanisms of the nervous system, physiological psychologists can uncover many truths about human behavior. Unlike other subdivisions within biological psychology, the main focus of psychological research is the development of theories that describe brain-behavior relationships.

Physiological psychology studies many topics relating to the body&#x27;s response to a behavior or activity in an organism. It concerns the brain cells, structures, components, and chemical interactions that are involved in order to produce actions. Psychologists in this field usually focus their attention to topics such as sleep, emotion, ingestion, senses, reproductive behavior, learning/memory, communication, psychopharmacology, and neurological disorders. The basis for these studies all surround themselves around the notion of how the nervous system intertwines with other systems in the body to create a specific behavior.

== Nervous system ==

The nervous system can be described as a control system that interconnects the other body systems. It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve tissues throughout the body. The system&#x27;s primary function is to react to internal and external stimuli in the human body. It uses electrical and chemical signals to send out responses to different parts of the body, and it is made up of nerve cells called neurons. Through the system, messages are transmitted to body tissues such as a muscle. There are two major subdivisions in the nervous system known as the central and peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The brain is the control center of the body and contains millions of neural connections. This organ is responsible for sending and receiving messages from the body and its environment. Each part of the brain is specialized for different aspects of the human being. For example, the temporal lobe has a major role in vision and audition, whereas the frontal lobe is significant for motor function and problem solving. The spinal cord is attached to the brain and serves as the main connector of nerves and the brain. The nerve tissue that lies outside of the central nervous system is collectively known as the peripheral nervous system. This system can be further divided into the autonomic and somatic nervous system. The autonomic system can be referred to as the involuntary component that regulates bodily organs and mechanisms, such as digestion and respiration. The somatic system is responsible for relaying messages back and forth from the brain to various parts of the body, whether it is taking in sensory stimuli and sending it to the brain or sending messages from the brain in order for muscles to contract and relax.
The nervous system is a complex and intricate network of cells and fibers that serves as the communication hub within the human body. Consisting of the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which extends throughout the rest of the body, this system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body and facilitating the coordination of various physiological functions. Neurons, the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system, transmit electrical and chemical signals, enabling the rapid exchange of information. The CNS, as the command center, processes sensory input, initiates responses, and stores memories. In contrast, the PNS connects the CNS to organs, muscles, and glands, allowing for voluntary and involuntary actions. The intricate interplay of the nervous system is essential for maintaining homeostasis, responding to stimuli, and orchestrating complex behaviors and cognitive processes. Understanding the structure and function of the nervous system is fundamental to comprehending various neurological disorders and advancing medical interventions to support overall human health and well-being.

==Emotion==

Emotion constitutes a major influence for determining human behaviors. It is thought that emotions are predictable and are rooted in different areas in our brains, depending on what emotion it evokes.
An emotional response can be divided into three major categories including behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal. 
*The behavioral component is explained by the muscular movements that accompany the emotion. For example, if a person is experiencing fear, a possible behavioral mechanism would be to run away from the fear factor.
*The autonomic aspect of an emotion provides the ability to react to the emotion. This would be the fight-or-flight response that the body automatically receives from the brain signals.
*Lastly, hormones released facilitate the autonomic response. For example, the autonomic response, which has sent out the fight-or-flight response, would be aided by the release of such chemicals like epinephrine and norepinephrine, both secreted by the adrenal gland, in order to further increase blood flow to aid in muscular rejuvenation of oxygen and nutrients.
Emotions in decision making can cause irrational outcomes. Two types of emotions occur in the decision-making process which anticipating emotions and immediate emotions. Loss and gain in anticipated emotions people will experience the outcomes differently depending on the situation. Immediate emotions are considered true emotions which integrates cognition with somatic or bodily components of the autonomic nervous system to express the emotion externally.

Emotion activates several areas of the brain inside the limbic system and varies per emotion:
*Fear: the amygdala is the main component for acquisition, storage, and expression of fear.
**Lesions on the central amygdaloid can lead to disruptions in the behavioral and autonomic emotional responses of fear.
*Anger/aggression: the hypothalamus and amygdala work together to send inhibitory/excitatory impulses to the periaqueductal gray which then carries out usually defensive behaviors.
*Happiness: the ventral tegmental area works closely with the prefrontal cortex to produce emotions of happiness as they lie upon the same dopamine pathways.
Several hormones are secreted in response to emotions and vary from general emotional tuning to specific hormones released from certain emotions alone: 
*Emotions are seen as a positive feedback cycle in the brain. Oxytocin acts to over-sensitize the limbic system to emotional responses leading to even larger emotional responses. Under the response to emotions, even more oxytocin is secreted therefore increasing the response further. In addition to the general effects oxytocin has on the limbic system, it provides a more specific purpose as well in the body. It acts as an anxiety suppressant mainly found in stressful and social situations. It provides a calming effect to the body during these high stress situations. Oxytocin is also seen as a strong hormone in maternal attachment and aggression found in new mothers. This hormone also plays a slight part in the female desire to pair and mate.
*Another hormone found in the direct response from emotion is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted in response to fearful stimuli. ACTH is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to fear and plays a role in the facilitation or inhibition of behaviors and actions to follow. In most cases, a high ACTH secretion will lead to the inhibition of actions that would produce the same fearful response that just occurred.
*Happiness is primarily controlled by the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the body. Both are monoamine neurotransmitters that act on different sites in the body. Serotonin acts on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract while dopamine acts on receptors in the brain, while both performing similar functions. Dopamine is known to be the primary hormone acting on the brain&#x27;s &quot;reward system&quot;, while this has recently begun to be a point of debate in the research community. Serotonin has less known on how it carries out its function in reducing depression, but only that it works. Specific-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the type of drug given to patients with depression in which the serotonin is left in the synapse to continue to be absorbed in the body.

==Sleep==
Sleep is a behavior that is provoked by the body initiating the feeling of sleepiness in order for people to rest for usually several hours at a time. During sleep, there is a reduction of awareness, responsiveness, and movement. On average, an adult human sleeps between seven and eight hours per night. There is a minute percentage that sleeps less than five to six hours, which is also a symptom of sleep deprivation, and an even smaller percentage of people who sleep more than ten hours a day. Oversleeping has been shown to have a correlation with higher mortality. There are no benefits to oversleeping and it can result in sleep inertia, which is the feeling of drowsiness for a period of time after waking. There are two phases of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and Non-REM sleep (NREM).

REM sleep is the less restful stage in which one dreams and experiences muscle movements or twitches. Also during this stage in sleep, a person&#x27;s heart rate and breathing are typically irregular. The electrical activity in the brain during REM sleep causes signals the same overwhelming intensity of being awake inside. The same brain energy is used during REM sleep measured by oxygen and glucose metabolism equally to being awake. EEGs are used to observe these patterns in the brain during the different stages of REM and Non-REM sleep.

Non-REM sleep, also sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep, is associated with deep sleep. The body&#x27;s blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing are generally significantly decreased compared to an alert state. Dreaming can occur in this state; however a person is not able to remember them due to how deep in sleep they are and the inability for consolidation to occur in memory. REM cycles typically occur in 90 minute intervals and increase in length as the amount of sleep in one session progresses. In a typical night&#x27;s rest, a person will have about four to six cycles of REM and Non-REM sleep.

Sleep is important for the body in order to restore itself from the depletion of energy during wakefulness and allows for recovery since cell division occurs the fastest during the Non-REM cycle. Sleep is also important for maintaining the functioning of the immune system, as well as helping with the consolidation of information previously learned and experienced into the memory. If sleep deprived, recall of information is typically decreased. Dreams that occur during sleep have been shown to increase mental creativity and problem solving skills.

As the period of time since the last Non-REM cycle has occurred increases, the body&#x27;s drive towards sleep also increases. Physical and environmental factors can have a great influence over the body&#x27;s drive towards sleep. Mental stimulation, pain and discomfort, higher/lower than normal environmental temperatures, exercise, light exposure, noise, hunger, and overeating all result in an increase in wakefulness. On the contrary, sexual activity and some foods such as carbohydrates and dairy products promote sleep.

==Careers in the field==
In the past, physiological psychologists received a good portion of their training in psychology departments of major universities. Currently, physiological psychologists are also being trained in behavioral neuroscience or biological psychology programs that are affiliated with psychology departments, or in interdisciplinary neuroscience programs. Most physiological psychologists receive PhDs in neuroscience or a related subject and either teach and carry out research at colleges or universities, are employed for research for government laboratories or other private organizations, or are hired by pharmaceutical companies to study the effects that various drugs have on an individual&#x27;s behavior.

Various forms of psychology concentrations are included in the sectors of health psychology, forensic psychology, clinical psychology,  industrial and organizational psychology, and school psychology. Health psychology is a discipline that understands the psychological, behavioral, and cultural aspects that affect the physical health and illnesses within individuals. A psychologists with the focus of health psychology would have a biopsychosocial model approach with patients. Forensic psychologists usually have a background in criminal justice and pursue a master&#x27;s in forensic psychology. Clinical psychology can be pursued in education by a master&#x27;s or a PsyD program to receive more research or academic experience. This approach will include psychological assessment, consultation, and psychotherapy. Industrial and organizational psychology focuses on the corporate world to help the function of the work flow for organizations and their relationships with employees. This helps increase job satisfaction and work goals by using surveys and reinforcement with a reward system between employee and employer. School psychologists work in education to partner with schools to provide in house counseling assistance.

== Medical Treatment ==
Pharmacology is biomedical science that helps in the branch of research to discover the characteristics of chemicals that affect biological functionalism and the relationship to other parts of the body. The use of science benefits the knowledge on drugs that then become part of the traditional medical practice that patients may benefit from. Most people cannot afford mental healthcare so they seek the options from clinics and any assistance that is offered through work or school. Medical insurance can help cover expenses and government assisted insurances can help as well. There are programs like company Betterhelp who provide mental health services at discounted rates as well as financial aid that can help reduce costs.

==Events==
* 11 May 1690: Sent by Massachusetts, Sir William Phips captures Port Royal. Frontenac repels Phips&#x27; attack on Quebec (October). These events are part of what is sometimes called King William&#x27;s War.
* 22 October 1692 - Marie-Madeleine Jarret de Verchères defends the family fort with a handful of seniors and children against the Iroquois, a true youthful hero of New France.
* 1696-97: European fur market collapses as fashion temporarily changes, leading to an increase in colonist settlers wanting permanent land to clear and farm.
* 1697: After almost a decade of guerrilla warfare, the Peace of Ryswick merely confirms the status quo, even returning Acadia, captured by the English, to the French. England and France make temporary peace in 1697 (Treaty of Ryswick). French continue to pressure Iroquois, who eventually agree to (but don&#x27;t hold) neutrality in the English-French conflicts. The 1693 group of Maritimes Tribal treaties mentioned above comes from this war.

<doc id="485929" wikidata="Q4056089" url="?curid=485929" title="Australian Competition and Consumer Commission">
<text>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the chief competition regulator of the Government of Australia, located within the Department of the Treasury. It was established in 1995 with the amalgamation of the Australian Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority to administer the &quot;Trade Practices Act 1974&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Competition and Consumer Act 2010&quot; on 1 January 2011. The ACCC&#x27;s mandate is to protect consumer rights and business rights and obligations, to perform industry regulation and price monitoring, and to prevent illegal anti-competitive behaviour.

==Historical origins==
The ACCC&#x27;s deeper origins are found in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of Sir Garfield Barwick, Attorney-General in the Liberal Government of Sir Robert Menzies in 1965. Opponents derided Barwick&#x27;s Trade Practices Act 1965 as &quot;ineffectual&quot;.

 (The Act) did not declare any practices illegal ipso facto, but only did so after detailed investigation by the Trade Practices Commissioner. There were so many restrictive practices reported to the Commissioner, and the investigations were so prolonged, that one cynic remarked that at the (then) current rate of progress, it would take a hundred years to examine them all!

Though recognised as a failure, Barwick&#x27;s legislation established in Australian law &quot;the principle of legislative coverage of trade practices&quot;. The area badly needed reform. Lionel Murphy, the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor Government, solicited the advice of the economist and business commentator, Professor Ted Wheelwright. In April 1973, Wheelwright produced a report for Murphy which became the blueprint of new legislation. He recommended, among other things, that the Act be clearly focused on protecting the consumer.

Murphy is acknowledged as having completely changed the previous approach regarding trade practices in Australia. For the first time in Australian federal law, his Trade Practices Bill, which was passed on 6 August 1974, introduced offences related to monopolisation, exclusive dealing, price discrimination, resale price maintenance, restraints of trade by agreement, anti-competitive mergers, misleading advertising, coercive sales conduct, pyramid selling, and the sale of unsolicited goods.

Though the Act included substantial penalties, Murphy&#x27;s initiative received very little opposition in the Parliament or the business community.

== Roles ==
The ACCC administers the Competition and Consumer Act, and has standing to take action in the Federal Court of Australia to enforce its provision. The Competition and Consumer Act contains a broad range of provisions, such as provisions on anti-competitive conduct, the Australian Consumer Law and regulation of telecommunications and energy industries. The ACCC, under the Act, also regulates certain industries by providing access to national infrastructure. The ACCC also has an educative role and seeks to educate both consumers and businesses as to their rights and responsibilities under the Act.

The Australian Energy Regulator is a constituent but separate part of the ACCC and is responsible for economic energy regulation. It shares staff and premises with the ACCC, but has a separate board, although at least one board member must also be a Commissioner at the ACCC.

== Restrictive trade practices ==
In most cases the spirit of the Act, and thus the actions of the ACCC, favours neither consumer nor supplier, but strives to achieve a competitive market without artificial restrictions. For example, refusal to deal – a producer refusing to supply a potential retailer or customer with a product – is not itself illegal unless the action would have an anti-competitive effect on the market as a whole. 

== Penalties ==
The ACCC brings court action against companies that breach the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, which can result in the application of fines and other penalties.

The maximum fine for a corporation is calculated as the larger of: $50,000,000; or three times the value of the illegal benefit; or (if the value of the benefit cannot be ascertained) 30% of turnover for the preceding 12 months. Individuals may be fined up to $2,500,000 under the Competition and Consumer Act for offences such as price fixing or participation in a cartel.

The ACCC also has power to accept, on its own behalf, court enforceable undertakings under section 87B of the Competition and Consumer Act. Such undertakings may include a wide range of remedies to the conduct.

A range of other remedies can be ordered by the court. For example, companies are frequently forced to publish retractions of false advertising claims in national newspapers and at their places of business. Companies found in breach of the CCA are usually bound to implement a compliance program to ensure future compliance with the Act.

== Consumer confidence ==
In regard to its role of safeguarding consumer rights, there has been occasional criticism of the ACCC for being &quot;all-talk-no-action&quot;. This criticism is most likely due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining sufficient evidence to prove breaches of the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act.

The ACCC has exercised its authority in a number of retail areas, including fining retailer Target for false advertising and Woolworths (including some Safeway-branded supermarkets in Victoria) for anti-competitive liquor deals.

In 2008, the ACCC published findings of its inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for groceries in Australia. The report found that the Australian supermarket sector is &quot;workably competitive&quot;, but price competition is limited by barriers to entry and a lack of incentive for the two major players, Coles and Woolworths, to compete on price. The report also noted that Coles and Woolworths engage in deliberate strategies designed to ensure they maintain exclusive access to prime sites such as shopping centres to prevent centre managers leasing space to competing supermarkets.

In September 2009, the ACCC reached agreement with Coles and Woolworths to phase out restrictive lease agreements. The ACCC has enforced the law against producers of quack devices with medical claims like Power Balance. It won a case on 24 March 2016 against Valve for failing to provide refunds for faulty products, and making representations that domestic consumer guarantees did not apply to purchases using the Steam client.

== Product safety and recalls ==
The ACCC maintains a website listing all Australian product recalls.
The following organisations are commissioned to assist with the surveillance and monitoring of product safety in relevant areas: 

* Food products – Food Standards Australia New Zealand
* Motor vehicles – Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)
* Therapeutic goods – Therapeutic Goods Administration
* Agricultural and veterinary products – Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority
* Electrical goods – Australian Electrical Equipment Safety Regulators
* Gas and appliance – Gas Technical Regulators Committee Australia New Zealand

The ACCC, in conjunction with state and territory offices of fair trading, is responsible for developing and enforcing mandatory consumer product safety standards except where the product falls into the jurisdiction of one of the specialist regulators mentioned above

<doc id="485932" wikidata="Q376055" url="?curid=485932" title="Garratt locomotive">
<text>A Garratt locomotive is a type of articulated steam locomotive invented by British engineer Herbert William Garratt that is articulated into three parts. Its boiler, firebox, and cab are mounted on a centre frame or &quot;bridge&quot;. The two other parts, one at each end, have a pivot to support the central frame; they consist of a steam engine unit – with driving wheels, trailing wheels, valve gear, and cylinders, and above it, fuel and/or water storage.

Articulation permits locomotives to negotiate curves that might restrict large rigid-framed locomotives. The design also provides more driving wheels per unit of locomotive weight, permitting operation on lightly engineered track. Garratt locomotives produced as much as twice the tractive effort of the largest conventional locomotives of railways that introduced them, reducing the need for multiple locomotives and crews.

==Advantages of the Garratt design==
The principal benefit of the Garratt design is that the boiler and firebox unit are slung between the two engine units. A further advantage is that the firebox and ashpan are not restricted in dimensions by running gear; the ashpan can have much larger capacity than on a normal locomotive, allowing longer continuous runs without needing to stop and empty the ashpan to clear combustion products from the grate. A large firebox and its unrestricted air supply also allowed the Garratt to operate with poor-quality fuel without reducing steaming capacity.

Garratts ran equally well in either direction, negating the need for turntables. Often they ran with the cab leading the boiler (sometimes called [fuel] bunker leading), especially on routes with tunnels.

Most Garratts were designed for freight or mixed traffic, but several Garratt classes were designed for passenger service. A French-built Algerian Railways Garratt holds the world speed record for an articulated locomotive at . Garratts operating at higher speeds had one advantage over the Mallet design on account of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves, the boiler and cab unit moved inward, reducing the centrifugal force, whereas the Mallet&#x27;s forward articulated unit moved out as the locomotive rounded curves.

As O.S. Nock wrote, the Garratt type holds several advantages over the Mallet type:This [the Mallet] was so designed to provide a very large engine unit, to be managed by a single crew, but to spread the dead weight over many axles and thus avoid excessive loads on the track and under-line bridges, and at the same time retain flexibility of wheelbase to facilitate operation on severely curved sections of line. The Mallet, having driving-wheel units beneath the boiler, retains the limitation in dimensions inherent in the orthodox type of steam locomotive, while the immense length of some of these machines is itself a handicap. Except with oil firing, ... one cannot put the cab in front. H.W. Garratt ... patented ... the idea of having a single large boiler slung on a cradle carried on two entirely separate engine units. ... The boiler could be developed to ideal proportions, unfettered by any wheels beneath it. It could be kept short, and of large diameter, which is the best possible form for securing a high rate of evaporation.

Although at the end of the steam locomotive era, most conventional steam locomotives had reached their maximum in &quot;critical dimensions&quot;, the Garratt still had potential for further development, with larger driving wheels, larger boilers, and greater output still achievable.

==Disadvantages of the Garratt concept==
The major theoretical disadvantage of a Garratt (shared with all tank engines) was that adhesive weight decreases as water is used up from the front tank and coal and water from the rear tank and bunker. The phenomenon does exist, but was minimised by the adhesion of the multiplicity of driving wheels, sufficient usually to avoid wheel slippage.

==Competitors, look-alikes, and variations on the theme==

The Garratt was not alone in the field of articulated locomotives; most notably, articulated locomotives in the United States based on the Mallet design achieved power outputs far exceeding those of Garratts. Away from North America were the Fairlie and Meyer articulated types. Further, similar designs to the Garratt were the Union Garratt, Modified Fairlie, and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union Garratt, a type originally prompted by the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a mechanical stoker. They were, in effect, a hybrid Fairlie and Garratt with the rear bunker attached to the frame instead of being carried on the rear bogie. The class GH and class U Union Garratts of the South African Railways were examples.

==Garratt development==

Herbert William Garratt, a British locomotive engineer, invented the articulated locomotive concept that bore his name, for which he was granted a patent (no. 12079). At the time, he was the New South Wales Railways&#x27; inspecting engineer in London following a career with British colonial railways. Garratt first approached Kitson and Company with his design, but his idea was rejected, perhaps because that company were already committed to the Kitson-Meyer articulated design. He then approached Beyer, Peacock and Company, which were only marginally more interested.

===The first Garratts===
In 1907, Beyer, Peacock and Company submitted a proposal for a gauge Garratt to the New South Wales Government Railways, which was not proceeded with. The following year a design for a gauge Mallet locomotive was submitted in reply to an enquiry from the Government of Tasmania. The company then proposed a Garratt design based on, but a little heavier than, the design for New South Wales, with capacity to negotiate curves of radius and 1 in 25 gradients. The proposal was accepted, and two locomotives were built in 1909, which became the K class.

The Tasmanian Railways stipulated two features that were not in Herbert Garratt&#x27;s original concept. The first was a compound configuration in which two high-pressure cylinders were on the rear engine unit and a pipe led to two larger, low-pressure cylinders on the front engine unit. The second was to have the cylinders facing inwards, which would reduce the distances between both the main steam pipe and the high-pressure cylinders and between the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders. The latter feature made the locomotive unnecessarily complicated and placed the high-pressure cylinders directly underneath the cab, making it uncomfortably hot for the crew on the rare days when Tasmania&#x27;s West Coast Range was warm. Only one more Garratt locomotive was produced with compound propulsion (by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. in 1927 for Burma Railways). The company built no more Garratts with inward-facing cylinders, but two Garratts operated by the Southern Fuegian tourist railway at Ushuaia in Argentina, largely based on the K class, have that feature.

Early design and construction difficulties involved the steam-tight flexible connections between the boiler unit and the power units. However, Beyer, Peacock&#x27;s engineers solved them after studying a description of the spherical steam joints used on a Fairlie locomotive.

===Darjeeling Himalayan Railway===
The third Garratt (another , like the first two) was built in 1910 for the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and given the class letter &quot;D&quot;. The power output was intended to be double that of the line&#x27;s existing locomotives, but only a 65% increase in loading was achieved.

===First main-line class===
In 1911, Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company built six Garratts for the Western Australian Government Railways. The M class were followed by the Ms class and the Msa class. These locomotives formed the pattern for the Victorian Railways narrow gauge G class and the Australian Portland Cement Garratts.

===Final Garratts constructed===

Beyer, Peacock built more than a thousand Garratt or Beyer-Garratt locomotives. The final built to a Beyer-Peacock design, in , were eight gauge South African Railways Class NG G16 locomotives.

===Production list===
The following list shows known Garratt construction by all manufacturers.


==Garratts around the world==

Garratts were used in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. No Garratts were used on North American railroads, the most likely explanation being that American rail companies considered the Garratt&#x27;s coal and water capacities insufficient for their requirements.

===Africa===
The Garratt was most widely used in Africa: large numbers were in South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Algeria, and smaller numbers in Angola, Congo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Libya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Uganda and Zaïre.

====Algeria====
In Algeria, 29 Garratts, constructed between 1936 and 1941 by the Société Franco-Belge de Matériel de Chemins de Fer at Raismes in Northern France, operated until the Algerian independence war caused their withdrawal in 1951. This class, designated 231-132BT, was streamlined and featured Cossart motion gear, mechanical stokers and driving wheels, the largest of any Garratt class. On a test in France, one of these achieved a speed of —a record for any Garratt class (and indeed any articulated class).

====Angola====
All three main railways in Angola used Garratts. The largest user was the gauge Caminho de Ferro de Benguela. Forty-eight were purchased from Beyer, Peacock between 1926 and 1956. They came in four batches: class 10A (301–306); class 10B (311–324) in 1930; class 10C (331–348) in 1954; and class 10D (361–370).

The second-largest user was the Caminhos de Ferro de Luanda, which bought six locomotives (501–506) from Beyer, Peacock in 1949, and six more (551–556) from Krupp of Germany in 1954.

The third user was the Caminhos de Ferro de Moçâmedes, who bought six locomotives (101–106) from Henschel &amp; Son of Germany.

====Botswana====
Garratts operated on gauge through trains from South Africa to Rhodesia.

====Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda ====
Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, which operated railways in British East Africa and the Uganda Protectorate from 1929 to 1948, acquired 77 Garratts between the same years. The Tanganyika Railway also acquired 3 in 1928. In 1948, the railways merged to form the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation, commonly known in the railways context as East African Railways, shown by the letters &quot;EAR&quot; on rolling stock.

In addition to the 80 acquired Garratts, East African Railways operated 63 that it purchased new between 1954 and 1956, making a total of 143. More details are in the following table.

The East African Railways 59 class Garratts were the largest and most powerful steam locomotives to run on metre gauge, having a large grate and a tractive effort of . The 34 oil-fired locomotives remained in regular service until 1980. , the Nairobi Railway Museum held two of them.

====Mozambique====
 and Garratts operated in Mozambique, some built as late as 1956.

====Rhodesia / Zimbabwe and Zambia====
Rhodesia imported 246 gauge Garratts of four different wheel arrangements: s of the 13th, 14th and 14A classes; s of the 15th class, s of the 16th, 16A, and 18th classes; and s of the 20th and 20A classes. Many went to Zambia Railways in 1967 when Rhodesia Railways surrendered the lines in Zambia to its government. Zimbabwe&#x27;s economic and political situation has extended the life of its Garratts. Five Garratts, including some from the Zimbabwe National Railway Museum, were returned to service in 2004–05 to haul commuter trains. they were performing shunting duties around the city of Bulawayo.

====Sierra Leone====
On the Sierra Leone Government Railway, this gauge system had Garratts starting in the 1920s and in the middle 1950s purchased 14 Garratts.

====South Africa====
In 1921, the South African Railways held a comparative trial between three locomotives: a class 14B 4-8-2 tender engine; a class MH Mallet 2-6-6-2, and a newly arrived class GA Garratt 2-6-0+0-6-2 – the first Garratt of that gauge to enter service in South Africa. The trial was conducted on the line between Durban and Ladysmith, which had gradients as steep as 1 in 30 and curves as tight as in radius. The Garratt proved the superior locomotive in all regards.

The most powerful of all Garratts irrespective of gauge were the South African Railways&#x27; eight gauge GL class locomotives of 1929–30, which delivered of tractive effort. They were all out of service by the late 1960s. There was also a proposal for a &quot;quadruplex&quot; super Garratt locomotive with a 2-6-6-2+2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement for South African Railways, but this was never built.

On the two foot gauge lines in South Africa, several successive classes of Garratts were made, of which the NG G16 became the most powerful steam locomotive ever built for the gauge. Some of these were imported to Wales for the Welsh Highland Railway.

====Sudan====
Sudan operated at least one Garratt.

===Asia===

====Myanmar (Burma)====
Burma had 43 metre gauge Garratts. Five B class Garratts went to the Burma Railway Company between 1924 and 1927, with seven more built by Krupp of Germany in 1929. They were followed by 31 locomotives transferred from India for War Department service: ten locomotives, class GB (ex-Indian class MWGL); twelve locomotives of class GC (ex-Indian class MWGH); and nine locomotives of class GD (ex-Indian class MWGX). A class of four locomotives, the GE class, was built for Burma Railways in 1949, but was diverted to the Assam Railway in India.

Two 0-6-0+0-6-0 2 ft 6in gauge Beyer-Garratts were supplied to the Buthidaung-Maungdaw Tramway which became the Arakan Light Railway. BP works Nos. 5702 &amp; 5703 of 1913 refer.

====Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)====
Ceylon had 10 Garratts: an H1 class in 1924, a C1 class in 1927 and eight more C1 class gauge s in 1945.

====India====
India had 83 Garratts. One gauge was built for the Indian State in 1925. The gauge Bengal Nagpur Railway had 32 Garratts: a pair of HSG class locomotives built in 1925; 16 N class and 10 NM class locomotives built in 1930–31 and four P class locomotives built in 1939.

The metre gauge Assam-Bengal Railway had six T class locomotives built in 1927. They later became the GT class on the Bengal Assam Railway. Three types of Garratt were supplied for war service on the BAR: ten MWGL class locomotives; twelve MWGH locomotives; and 18 MWGX class War Department standard light Garratts. Of these, only nine MWGX stayed in India, with the remainder transferred to Burma. After the war, the four Burma Railways GE class s were diverted to the Assam Railway.

====Iran====
The Trans-Iranian Railway had four Garratts (class 86) built in 1936.

====Mauritius====
Mauritius had three standard gauge Garratts that were built in 1927.

====Nepal====
The Nepal Government Railway (NGR) had Garratt locomotives manufactured by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1932 and 1947.

====Siam (Thailand)====

The Royal State Railway of Siam acquired 8 Garratts built by the German company Henschel during 1929–1937 for heavy freight duties in the Pak Chong highland areas. One has been preserved; it is displayed at Kanchanaburi railway station.

====Turkey====
Turkish State Railways had just one standard gauge Garratt that was built in 1927.

===Australasia===
The Australian Standard Garratt (ASG) was designed in Australia as an emergency measure during World War II, when demand on narrow-gauge railways could not be met by the available stock of locomotives. The ASG was used on the railways of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and, after the war, on the South Australian Railways, the Emu Bay Railway in Tasmania and the Fyansford Cement Works railway in Victoria. 

The first was built in a record-breaking four months, entering service in September 1943. Considerable differences between the states, especially in loading gauges, sharpness of curves and limits to axle load, compromised the design, as did the inclusion of features that led to unreliability. A royal commission convened in 1946 to investigate the locomotives, whose deficiencies had caused enginemen to go on strike, concluded: &quot;It is obvious when one analyses the evidence that the new Australian Standard Garratt has put up a poor performance. At times these locomotives have done good work but they cannot compare with the old Beyer Garratts, which have such an enduring record of service.&quot; Many were withdrawn in September 1945, weeks after the war ended. Those sold to the South Australian Railways in 1952 (as a stopgap) served for only 18 months, but others lasted longer: on the Queensland Government Railways for two years, at Fyansford and Emu Bay for 11 years, on the Tasmanian Government Railways (including some ex-QR engines) for 13 years, and on the Western Australian Government Railways for 14 years, during which periods many of the defects were rectified or components replaced.

====New South Wales====

New South Wales Government Railways introduced the AD60 Garratt in 1952, built by Beyer, Peacock. The AD60 weighed 265 tonnes, with a 16-tonne axle loading. As delivered, it developed a tractive effort of ), not as powerful as the South African Railways GMA/M Garratts of 1954, which developed a tractive effort of . Following modifications in 1958 to thirty AD60s, their tractive effort was increased to . These locomotives remained in service until the early 1970s with a replacement &quot;6042&quot; using the boiler cradle of 6043 (The original was scrapped in 1968) the last withdrawn in February 1973. Oberg wrote he witnessed an AD60 clear a dead 1220-tonne double-headed diesel freight (total weight 1450 tonnes) from a 1 in 55 grade without wheel slip. Four AD60&#x27;s survive today: 6029 (which operates occasionally out of Thirlmere), 6039 (under private ownership at Dorrigo Museum), 6040 (on static display at THNSW, Thirlmere), &amp; 6042 (also owned by the Dorrigo museum but sitting in the middle of a field in Forbes, NSW).

====Queensland====
Queensland Railways operated 30 Beyer Garratt locomotives. These were mainly based in the Rockhampton area.

====South Australia====

One of ten Garratts delivered in 1953 to the South Australian Railways – number 409 – is on static display at the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide, South Australia. The locomotives were ordered in 1951 from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, when there was a need for more and bigger motive power to haul the heavy ore trains on the narrow-gauge line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie. The company subsequently subcontracted the order, with main specifications identical to those of the notable 60th class of the East African Railways, to Société Franco-Belge, its European associate based in Raismes.

By 1955, the 400 class had taken over most of the working of the Broken Hill line. They operated as oil-burners, with provision for a mechanical stoker to be installed if converted to burn coal. They were also designed to be easily converted for service on either the broad or standard gauge. They were superseded by diesel power in 1963.

====Tasmania====
Following the success of the K class Garratts on the North East Dundas Tramway, the Tasmanian Government Railways imported Beyer, Peacock Garratts for their main lines, in particular the M class for express passenger work. These were the only eight-cylinder Garratts. The M1 achieved a world speed record of on 30 November 1912. Their 5-foot (1.5 m) diameter driving wheels were at the time the largest on any narrow-gauge locomotive in Australia. Their eight cylinders proved a nightmare to maintain, and after several fatal and disastrous derailments in the late 1920s, mainly due to inadequate trackwork, they were withdrawn and scrapped.

====Victoria====
Victorian Railways operated two Beyer Garratts, used on the Crowes and Walhalla narrow-gauge railway lines. The two engines were classified as G class, numbered G41 and G42; the latter engine has been restored. It is currently in use at the Puffing Billy Railway near Melbourne. It was not used in public service on that line prior to the preservation era. Fyansford Cement Works operated a 3&#x27;6&quot; gauge line, with an ASG (G33) and 2 Garratts (No.1 and No.2) similar in design to the WAGR Ms class, although these 2 were not designated any class of their own. No.1 was scrapped but No.2 and G33 are preserved at the Bellarine Railway, with G33 currently undergoing restoration work.

====New Zealand====
Beyer, Peacock built three NZR G class locomotives in 1928, which were too powerful for the system and had complicated valve mechanisms. Unusually, these engines had three cylinders () each, on two sets of engine frames, thus creating a six-cylinder Garratt; they were the second and final Garratts to employ this arrangement, the other being the one-off LNER U1. They entered service in 1929. Walschaerts valve gear operated the outside cylinders with the inner third cylinder linked by a Gresley conjugated valve gear. Photos verify the coal bunker was carried on an extension to the boiler frame rather than on the rear engine frame, as with most Garratts. The engines delivered of tractive effort, which was too powerful for the drawbars on the rolling stock. After a few years they were rebuilt as six Pacifics, also unsuccessful, but which saw nearly twenty years of service.

Though no NZR Garratts survived, three preserved imported African Garratts are in New Zealand: Rhodesia Railways class 15A No. 398 of the Flying 15 Trust, Pakakarakiki, class 14A No. 509 of Mainline Steam Trust Plimmerton (under restoration), and South African Railways GMAM class No. 4083 at Mercer Auckland with the Mainline Steam Trust awaiting restoration. When it first arrived in NZ in the 1990s, it was steamed and ran in their former Parnell Depot yard. See preservation below.

===Europe===
Garratts were mainly employed in Great Britain, Russia, and Spain, where some five railway companies employed seven classes. These included the 1931 order for Central of Aragon Railway for six &quot;Double Pacific&quot; Garratts for fast passenger service. In addition a Dutch and a Belgian tramway also operated one or more engines based on and built to the Garratt design.

====Netherlands====
In 1931, the Dutch &quot;Limburgsche Tramweg Maatschappij&quot; (LTM) &#x27;Limburg tramway company&#x27; ordered a single standard gauge Garratt, numbered LTM 51, from Henschel (Germany) with builder&#x27;s number 22063. This design was slightly different in that the coal bunker was located on the boiler frame and both machines only holding the watertanks. More importantly, it was the only Garratt with inside cylinders. The wheel arrangement was C+C (). Due to abandonment of the line in 1938, the locomotive was sold to a metal merchant, who in turn sold it to an engineers&#x27; bureau, that sold it in 1941 to Germany. Further whereabouts of this machine are unknown, but it is presumed scrapped.

====Spain====
Spain had a varied collection of Garratts from most builders; Beyer, Peacock themselves only building a pair of s for Rio Tinto in 1929. The first Garratts in Spain, however, were four metre gauge s built for the Ferrocarriles Catalanes in 1922 by Sociéte Anonyme St. Leonard of Liége, Belgium. Four more followed in 1925. Also on the metre gauge, the Ferrocarril de la Robla bought two pairs of s, the first from Hanomag of Germany in 1929, the second from Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Bilbao in 1931. The Compania Minera de Sierra Minera also bought a pair of metre-gauge s in 1930.

On the broad gauge, the Central of Aragon Railway bought six s from Babcock &amp; Wilcox and six s from Euskalduna of Bilbao, both in 1931. The last Garratts supplied to Spain were 10 s for Renfe by Babcock &amp; Wilcox in 1960.

====United Kingdom====
British usage of Garratts was minimal. A single large Garratt (, London and North Eastern Railway Class U1 number 2395/9999/69999) was built in 1925 for banking heavy coal trains on the Woodhead route; 33 Garratts were built for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway between 1927 and 1930, although their undersized axle-boxes made them unreliable and they were withdrawn in the mid-1950s. They were also trialled unsuccessfully on the Lickey Incline between Bromsgrove and Birmingham.

Four standard-gauge Garratt locomotives were supplied by Beyer, Peacock for industrial service in the UK. One survived and is preserved at Bressingham Steam Museum. No. 6841 &quot;William Francis&quot; was built in 1937 for use at Baddesley Colliery.

On the Welsh Highland Railway, a narrow-gauge tourist line in Wales, a few imported South African NGG16 Garratts haul the greater part of service trains on the railway.

====USSR====

Beyer, Peacock constructed the largest steam locomotive built in Europe, a for the USSR, works order number 1176, in 1932. The locomotive had the Russian classification Ya.01 (Я.01). This massive machine was built to the Russian standard gauge and a loading gauge height of . It underwent extensive testing and proved to be very able to operate in extremely low temperatures, due to adequate protection of the external plumbing between boiler and engine units. This may have been the lowest temperature operation of a Garratt type. The locomotive was used for a number of years for coal traffic in the Donbass region, but was never replicated. This decision appears to be a combination of unfamiliar maintenance processes and politics.

===North America===
No Garratts appeared in North America, although the American Locomotive Company became the sole licensee to build Garratts there. Alco was unable to garner sufficient interest from US railroads to produce even a prototype or demonstrator. This reluctance was reportedly based on a concern that tractive effort and factor of adhesion would suffer as the weight of water and fuel over the driving wheels diminished.

====United States====
In 1975, one Garratt NG class No. 50 formerly of the South African Railways was imported and is used on the private gauge Hempstead &amp; Northern Railroad in Hempstead, Texas, which also operate another former South African Railways &quot;Mikado&quot; type No. 18.

===South America===

====Argentina====
The British-owned gauge Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway operated twelve Garratt oil-fired locomotives, numbers 4851–4862, built by Beyer, Peacock in 1929. They were used on the Bahía Blanca North Western section, particularly on the Toay line), on the main Bahía Blanca North Western line to General Pico, and between Tres Arroyos and Bahía Blanca. They were withdrawn in the 1950s due to the rapid decline in freight traffic caused by the increasing competition from road transport.

Other British-owned railway companies in Argentina operated Garratt locomotives built by Beyer, Peacock:
* Argentine North Eastern Railway ( gauge): seven locomotives built 1925–1927 and three , built 1930
* Argentine Transandine ( gauge): four , built 1930
* Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway ( gauge): four , built 1929–1930
* Buenos Aires Midland Railway ( gauge): two , 1930
* Cordoba Central Railway ( gauge) : ten , built 1929
* Entre Rios Railway ( gauge): five and five , built 1927

The Southern Fuegian Railway at Ushuaia uses two gauge Garratts to haul tourist trains.

====Bolivia====
Three meter gauge were delivered to the Antofagasta and Bolivia Railway in 1929, followed by six more in 1950.

====Brazil====
In Brazil after 1927, the São Paulo Railway operated broad-gauge Garratts that ran passenger trains at 70 mph.

====Colombia====
In Colombia, one gauge Garratt was purchased by the FC Pacifico in 1924 and two more by the La Dorada in 1937.

====Peru====
Four standard gauge Garratts were delivered to the Central Railway of Peru from 1929 to 1931. (Donald Binns, The Central Railway of Peru and The Cerro de Pasco Railway, 1996)

==War locomotives==
During World War II, several Garratt designs were built to meet the wartime needs of narrow-gauge railways in Africa, Asia, and Australia.

Six Garratts were built for the gauge Sierra Leone Government Railway in 1942, to a design first supplied to that railway in 1926. Five of the older Garratts were converted to a wheel arrangement to increase their tractive effort.

Seventy Garratts were constructed by Beyer, Peacock for the War Department, to three standard designs. A based on the South African Railways GE class was constructed on gauge for West Africa and Rhodesia, while a heavier class of was constructed for East African Railways. A lighter metre-gauge was constructed for India, Burma, and East Africa. This design was particularly successful, and was the basis for several postwar classes.

The Australian Standard Garratt was designed in 1942, for use on gauge railways, in the critical period of World War II following the Japanese bombing of Darwin in 1942, and aerial attacks on other northern Australian centres. It was a locomotive, designed in Australia and constructed by a number of Australian railway workshops. Several design problems with the class emerged, and use of the locomotive encountered resistance from the drivers&#x27; union, especially in Queensland. Most were withdrawn at the end of the war, although a number continued to operate successfully in Tasmania.

==Preservation==
About 250 Garratts may exist today. However, many are dumped in varying states of disrepair in remoter parts of the world, and the number that may be likely to survive has been estimated as fewer than 100. , about 15 operating Garratt locomotives can be found in Europe, Africa, Argentina, the US and Australia.

The first Garratt locomotive, the K class of the North East Dundas Tramway, has been preserved. After the line closed in 1929 the locomotives were put up for sale. K1 was purchased by Beyer, Peacock in 1947 for their museum. The preserved locomotive has parts from both original engines. When Beyer, Peacock ceased trading, the locomotive was sold to the Ffestiniog Railway, who initially proposed to cut it down to meet their loading gauge. For a number of years it was on loan to the National Railway Museum and was exhibited in York. In 1995 it was removed from York to commence restoration in Birmingham. It was returned to Wales in 2000 where restoration was continued at the Ffestiniog Railway workshops at Boston Lodge. It was fitted with a new boiler and restored to full running order on the Welsh Highland Railway by September 2008. The Welsh Highland Railway owns several former South African SAR NGG 16 Class Garratts, and operates both the first (K1) and last (NG/G16 143) Garratts constructed by Beyer, Peacock.. The K1 ten year boiler ticket expired in 2014. Even though the locomotive had worked infrequently, a full boiler overhaul was required to meet UK regulations. The FR/WHR declined to fund this activity, citing lack of revenue generating opportunities for the locomotive and the need to maintain their core fleet of NG/G16 locomotives. Finally, in 2019 it was decided to move the locomotive to the Statfold Barn Railway in Central England on a ten year loan with two boiler overhauls in the agreement. The first boiler overhaul was quickly completed along with other work at a cost of 60,000 GBP and the locomotive seen in steam at Statfold in February 2020.

In Spain, a number 282F-0421, nicknamed &quot;Garrafeta&quot;, occasionally ran in the Lleida area but no longer. An enormous , number 462F-0401, is under slow cosmetic restoration. Both locomotives are managed by ARMF, a non-profit organisation which also holds the only main line repair workshop for historical railway vehicles on broad gauge network.

A single Hanomag-built narrow gauge example exists in the USA located in Hempstead Texas. It has been made operational again since November 2015.

Several Australian Garratts have been restored to operating condition. G 42, formerly used on the narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways, works regularly on the Puffing Billy Railway in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne. The Puffing Billy Railway is also rebuilding ex SAR NG/G16 129 which entered service in late 2019. The Queensland Railways removed 1009, its sole remaining gauge Garratt, from an open-air museum and fully restored it to working order. It was out of service by December 2007, awaiting a new boiler. NSWGR AD60 6029 was restored to operating condition in Canberra. As of 2018, 6029 is privately owned and is stored at Thirlmere, NSW. It is occasionally used by the NSW Rail Museum on mainline excursions. 3&#x27;6&quot; Garratts No.2 and G33 from Fyansford Cement Works are both preserved with the Bellarine Railway, with G33 undergoing restoration work and No.2 in storage.

In Kenya, East African Railways 59 class 5918 was maintained in operating condition from 2001 to 2011. Likewise in Zimbabwe 20th class 730 and 740 were held in operating condition until 2004. They have not run since 2004 when 730 was briefly used on Bulawayo commuter services. None are likely to operate again without external funding for major repairs as the only work available for them are excursion trains for foreign tourists and rail enthusiasts.

No New Zealand Railways G class Garratts survived, but three more modern Southern African Garratts have been imported for restoration in New Zealand, with No.509&#x27;s boiler certified and restoration nearing completion as of 2018.

*Beyer Peacock No.7340 of 1950 Rhodesia Railways class 15A No.398 The Flying Fifteen Group, Steam Incorporated Paekakariki (stored).
*Beyer Peacock No.7582 of 1953 Rhodesia Railways class 14A No.509. Mainline Steam Heritage Trust, Plimmerton (under restoration).
*Beyer Peacock No. 7681 of 1956 South African Railways GMAM class No.4083 Mainline Steam Heritage Trust, Mercer (stored).

In December 2007, Zimbabwe class 14A Garratt number 509, overhauled in Bulawayo was offloaded in New Zealand for operational preservation by the Mainline Steam trust. In early 2011 Zimbabwe 15th class 398 was also delivered to New Zealand for restoration to operating condition by Steam Inc.

As of December 2020 there is only one place in the World where one can with reasonable confidence view a Garratt in daily operating service. Ushuaia, Argentina whilst Dinas in North Wales offers the sight of daily operation for about 10 months of the year.

In September 2018, South Eastern Zone of Indian Railways made a successful trial run of a Beyer-Garratt numbered 811 from Kharagpur. A heritage service is planned and scheduled to start from the upcoming festival season.

== In fiction ==
In the movie &quot;Big World! Big Adventures!&quot; of the television program, Thomas &amp; Friends, an EAR 59 class Garratt, named &quot;Kwaku&quot;, was introduced.

<doc id="485939" wikidata="Q129728" url="?curid=485939" title="Fifth generation of video game consoles">
<text>The fifth generation era (also known as the 32-bit era, the 64-bit era, or the 3D era) refers to computer and video games, video game consoles, and handheld gaming consoles dating from approximately October 4, 1993, to March 23, 2006. The best-selling home console was the Sony PlayStation, followed by the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Atari Jaguar. The PlayStation also had a redesigned version, the PSone, which was launched on July 7, 2000.

Some features that distinguished fifth generation consoles from previous fourth generation consoles include:
* 3D polygon graphics with texture mapping
* 3D graphics capabilities – lighting, Gouraud shading, anti-aliasing and texture filtering
* Optical disc (CD-ROM) game storage, allowing much larger storage space (up to 650 MB) than ROM cartridges
* CD quality audio recordings (music and speech) – PCM audio with 16-bit depth and 44.1 kHz sampling rate
* Wide adoption of full motion video, displaying pre-rendered computer animation or live action footage
* Analog controllers
* Display resolutions from 480i/480p to 576i
* Color depth up to 16,777,216 colors (24-bit true color)

This era is known for its pivotal role in the video game industry&#x27;s leap from 2D to 3D computer graphics, as well as the shift in home console games from being stored on ROM cartridges to optical discs. This was also the first generation to feature internet connectivity: some systems had additional hardware which provided connectivity to an existing device, like the Sega Net Link for the Sega Saturn. The Apple Pippin, a commercial flop, was the first system to feature on-board internet capabilities.

For handhelds, this era was characterized by significant fragmentation, because the first handheld of the generation, the Sega Nomad, had a lifespan of just two years, and the Nintendo Virtual Boy had a lifespan of less than one. Both of them were discontinued before the other handhelds made their debut. The Neo Geo Pocket was released on October 28, 1998, but was dropped by SNK in favor of the fully backward compatible Neo Geo Pocket Color just a year later. Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color (1998) was the most successful handheld by a large margin. There were also two minor updates of the original Game Boy: the Game Boy Light (released in Japan only) and the Game Boy Pocket.

There was considerable time overlap between this generation and the next, the sixth generation of consoles, which began with the launch of the Dreamcast in Japan on November 27, 1998. The fifth generation ended with the discontinuation of the PlayStation (specifically its re-engineered form, the &quot;PSOne&quot;) on March 23, 2006, a year after the launch of the seventh generation.

==History==
===Transition to 3D===

The 32-bit/64-bit era is most noted for the rise of fully 3D polygon games. While there were games prior that had used three-dimensional polygon environments, such as &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; in the arcades and &quot;Star Fox&quot; on the Super NES, it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally 2D and pseudo-3D genres into 3D on video game consoles. Early efforts from then-industry leaders Sega and Nintendo saw the introduction of the 32X and Super FX, which provided rudimentary 3D capabilities to the 16-bit Genesis and Super NES. Starting in 1996, 3D video games began to take off with releases such as &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; on the Saturn, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; on the PlayStation and Saturn, &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; on the PlayStation, and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; on the Nintendo 64. Their 3D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry&#x27;s focus away from side-scrolling and rail-style titles, as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres. 3D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of CDs, due to the ability to produce games less expensively and the media&#x27;s high storage capabilities.

===CD vs cartridge===

After allowing Sony to develop a CD-based prototype console for them and a similar failed partnership with Philips, Nintendo decided to make the Nintendo 64 a cartridge-based system like its predecessors. Publicly, Nintendo defended this decision on the grounds that it would give games shorter load times than a compact disc (and would decrease piracy due to a certain chip in the ROM cartridge). However, it also had the dubious benefit of allowing Nintendo to charge higher licensing fees, as cartridge production was considerably more expensive than CD production. Many third-party developers like EA Sports viewed this as an underhanded attempt to raise more money for Nintendo and many of them became more reluctant to release games on the N64.

Nintendo&#x27;s decision to use a cartridge based system sparked a debate in the video game magazines as to which was better. The chief advantages of the CD-ROM format were (1) larger storage capacity, allowing for a much greater amount of game content; (2) considerably lower manufacturing costs, making them much less risky for game publishers; (3) lower retail prices due to the reduced need to compensate for manufacturing costs; and (4) shorter production times, which greatly reduced the need for publishers to predict the demand for a game. Its disadvantages compared to cartridge were (1) considerable load times; (2) their inability to load data &quot;on the fly&quot;, making them reliant on the console RAM; and (3) the greater manufacturing costs of CD-ROM drives compared to cartridge slots, resulting in generally higher retail prices for CD-based consoles. A Nintendo Power ad placed a Space Shuttle (representing cartridges) next to a snail (representing a CD), as an analogy for their respective speeds, stating that &quot;the future doesn&#x27;t belong to snails&quot;.

Almost every other contemporary system used the new CD-ROM technology. Consequent to the storage and cost advantages of the CD-ROM format, many game developers shifted their support away from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation. One of the most influential game franchises to change consoles during this era was the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which was developed for the PlayStation instead of the N64 due to storage capacity issues; prior &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games had all been published on Nintendo consoles – either the NES or Super NES, with the only other entries being on the Wonderswan, or computers like the MSX.

===Overview of the fifth-generation consoles===
The fifth generation was characterized by an unusually high number of console formats. More competing consoles comprised this generation than any other since the video game crash of 1983, leading video game magazines of the time to frequently predict a second crash.

====Major consoles====
The Atari Jaguar was released in November 1993 and was marketed as the world&#x27;s first 64-bit system. However, sales at launch were well below the incumbent fourth generation consoles, and a small games library rooted in a shortage of third-party support made it impossible for the Jaguar to catch up, selling below 250,000 units. The system&#x27;s 64-bit nature was also questioned by many. Its only add-on, the Jaguar CD, was released in 1995 and was produced in limited quantities due to the low install base of the system. The 32-bit Atari Panther, set to be released in 1991, was canceled due to unexpectedly rapid progress in developing the Jaguar.

The Sega Saturn was Sega&#x27;s entry into the stand-alone 32-bit console market. It was released in Japan simultaneously with the 32X in November 1994, although it would not have a North American release until six months later. It became Sega&#x27;s most successful console in Japan. In America and Europe however, a disastrous launch and an MSRP of $399 compared to the PlayStation&#x27;s $299 caused it to be a commercial failure, selling far fewer units than the Master System and Mega Drive/Genesis before it.

The PlayStation, released in early December 1994, was the most successful console of this generation. With attention given by third-party developers and a more mature marketing campaign aimed at the 20–30 age group enabling it to achieve market dominance, it became the first home console to ship 100 million units worldwide.

The Nintendo 64, originally announced as the &quot;Ultra 64&quot;, was released in 1996. The system&#x27;s delays and use of the expensive cartridge format made it an unpopular platform among third-party developers. Several popular first-party titles allowed the Nintendo 64 to maintain strong sales in the United States, but it remained a distant second to the PlayStation.

====Other consoles====
The Amiga CD32 was released in September 1993 and sold in Europe, Australia, Canada and Brazil. It was never released in the United States due to Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy and court-ordered import restrictions. Despite promising initial sales, the console was hampered by poor software quality with many titles being simply re-releases of older games. Production of the Amiga CD32 was discontinued after only eight months.

The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was one of the earliest fifth generation consoles and was released in October 1993. Despite having massive third-party support and an unprecedented amount of hype for a first-time entrant into the industry, it had early difficulties due to software development delays and its high price. For its initial release, the 3DO had a $700 retail price tag and only a single available game ready for market. The 3DO would be discontinued only three years later. While generally regarded as a failed system, the 3DO was this generation&#x27;s fourth best-selling console in a crowded field with sales of 2 million units.

The Sega 32X, an add-on console produced by Sega for the Genesis, was launched in November 1994. The Sega Neptune, a standalone version of the 32X, was announced but ultimately canceled. Sega failed to deliver a steady flow of games for the 32X platform. With customers anticipating the PlayStation on the horizon, and with Sega&#x27;s more technically advanced Saturn already competing on the market in Japan, sales of the 32X were poor.

NEC, creator of the TurboGrafx-16 of the previous generation, entered the market with the PC-FX in late December 1994. The system had a 32-bit processor, 16-bit stereo sound, and video capability. Despite its impressive specifications, it did not have a polygon processor and was marketed as a platform for 2D and full motion video games. The PC-FX game library was criticized for being low in quality, and having titles that relied more on animation than gameplay. Due to low expected sales, it was never released outside of Japan.

In 1995, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy, a supposedly portable system capable of displaying true 3D graphics, albeit in monochromatic red and black. Despite being marketed as a portable system, it is not actually portable in practice due to the lack of a head strap. Also, because of the nature of its display, the system reportedly caused headaches and eye strain. It was discontinued within a year, with fewer than 25 games being released for it. Although it sold over 750,000 units, Nintendo felt that it was a failure compared to consoles such as the Super Nintendo, which sold over 20 million.

===Aftermath of the fifth generation===
By the end of the 1995 Christmas shopping season, the fifth generation had come down to a struggle between the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and the upcoming Nintendo 64. The Amiga CD32 had already been discontinued; the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Genesis 32X, and Virtual Boy were still on the market but were considered a lost cause by industry analysts; the Neo Geo CD had proven to appeal only to a niche market; and industry analysts had already determined that the yet-to-launch Apple Bandai Pippin was too expensive to make any impact in the market. Moreover, even the leading fifth generation consoles were still facing sluggish sales. Combined sales for the PlayStation, Saturn, and Jaguar barely topped 1 million units for the Christmas shopping season, as compared to combined sales of 4 million for the Sega Genesis and Super NES. Focus groups showed that most children under 12 years old were equally happy playing on fourth generation consoles as they were playing on fifth generation consoles, making the fourth generation consoles more appealing to adults buying gifts for children, since they were cheaper. Industry analysts began putting forth the possibility that the fifth generation of consoles would never overtake the fourth generation in sales, and become superseded by a new generation of DVD player consoles before they could achieve mass acceptance.

1996 saw the fifth generation consoles&#x27; fortunes finally turn around. With the Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 all showing dramatic increases in sales over the previous year, they claimed a combined 40% of the retail market for hardware and software, putting them in position to finally overtake the fourth generation consoles in 1997.

The Sega Saturn suffered from poor marketing and comparatively limited third-party support outside Japan. Sega&#x27;s decision to use dual processors was roundly criticized, as this made it difficult to efficiently develop for the console. Sega was also hurt by the Saturn&#x27;s surprise four-month-early U.S. launch of their console; third-party developers, who had been planning for the originally scheduled launch, could not provide many launch titles and were angered by the move. Retailers were caught unprepared, resulting in distribution problems; some retailers, such as the now defunct KB Toys, were so furious that they refused to stock the Saturn thereafter.

Due to numerous delays, the Nintendo 64 was released one year later than its competitors. By the time it was finally launched in 1996, Sony had already established its dominance, the Saturn was starting to struggle, and the 3DO and Jaguar had been discontinued. Its use of cartridge media rather than compact discs alienated some developers and publishers due to the space limits, the relatively high cost involved, and a considerably longer production time. In addition, the initially high suggested retail price of the console may have driven potential customers away, and some early adopters of the system who had paid the initial price may have been angered by Nintendo&#x27;s decision to cut the price of the system by $50 six months after its release. However, the Nintendo 64 turned out to be a commercial success, particularly in the United States, where it sold 20.63 million units, nearly two thirds of its worldwide sales of 32.93 million units. It was also home to highly successful games such as &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; While Nintendo 64 sold far more units than the Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and 3DO combined, it posed no challenge to the PlayStation&#x27;s lead in the market.

By 1997, 40% to 60% of American homes played on video game consoles. 30% to 40% of these homes owned a console, while an additional 10% to 20% rented or shared a console.

=== Changes in the industry===
After the dust settled in the fifth generation console wars, several companies saw their outlooks change drastically.

==== Atari====
Atari Corporation, which was not able to recover its losses, ended up merging into JTS Corporation in 1996. This caused the Atari name to virtually disappear from the gaming market until 1998, when Hasbro Interactive purchased the Atari assets from JTS for $5 million, before selling itself to Infogrames for $100 million in 2001, and restructuring itself as a third-party developer.

On May 14, 1999, Hasbro Interactive announced that all rights to the Atari Jaguar were released into the public domain, thus declaring the platform open; this allowed anyone to freely create and publish games for the Jaguar without endorsement or licensing from Hasbro Interactive. Since then, homebrew developers began to release uncompleted Jaguar games as well as several brand new titles to satisfy the system&#x27;s cult following.

==== Sega ====
Sega&#x27;s loss of consumer confidence (coupled with its previous console failures), along with their financial difficulties, set the company up for a similar fate in the next round of console wars.

===Comparison===
===Other consoles===
These consoles are either less notable, never saw a worldwide release, and/or sold particularly poorly, and are therefore listed as &#x27;Other&#x27;.


===Worldwide sales standings===


From 1996 to 1999 (when the PlayStation, N64 and Saturn were the major 5th-generation consoles still on the market) Sony managed a 47% market share of the worldwide market, followed by Nintendo with 28% (with a percentage of that figure from the 16‑bit Super NES), while Sega was third with 23% (with a percentage of that from the Dreamcast).

Production of the Sega Saturn was discontinued in 1998. Its demise was accelerated by rumors that work on its successor was underway; these rumors hurt the systems&#x27; sales in the west as early as 1997. The N64 was succeeded by the GameCube in 2001, but continued its production until 2004; however, PlayStation production was not ceased as it was redesigned as the PSone, further extending the life of the console around the release of the follow-up PlayStation 2. The PlayStation console production was discontinued in 2006, the same year that the PlayStation 3 was released in Japan and North America.

==Handheld systems==
===Handheld comparison===


===Other handhelds===
==Milestone titles==
* &quot;&quot; (PlayStation, Saturn) by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo and Konami is considered one of the best PlayStation games available, and a strong argument for the relevance of 2D games in an increasingly 3D market.

<text>Events from the year 1858 in Canada.

==Incumbents==
*Monarch — Victoria

===Federal government===
*Parliament — 6th

===Governors===
*Governor General of the Province of Canada — Edmund Walker Head
*Colonial Governor of Newfoundland — Alexander Bannerman
*Governor of Nova Scotia — George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby
*Governor of Prince Edward Island — Dominick Daly

**Antoine-Aimé Dorion, Canada East Premier 
*Premier of Newfoundland — John Kent
*Premier of New Brunswick — Samuel Leonard Tilley

==Events==
*The Frontenac County Court House opens.
*The Canadian government imposes revenue tariffs on US manufactured goods to pay for railroad debts.
*The Province of Canada releases its first decimal coinage into circulation, minted in England.
*The Halifax-Truro line begins rail service.
*The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush starts, leading to the creation of the Colony of British Columbia on the Mainland and igniting the Fraser Canyon War.
**Chinese, German, Norwegian, Jews, American, Irish, Latin American, French, Belgian Canadian and other immigrants who had been in the California goldfields arrive in British Columbia, attracted by the Fraser River Gold rush, joining French Canadians, Métis, Hawaiians and others already in the area who abandoned regular employment to work the banks of the Fraser alongside the native peoples, who also took part in the rush.
**About 600 African-Americans from California move to Victoria, British Columbia by invitation of Governor James Douglas as part of the gold rush migration. One of them, Mifflin Gibbs, later plays a key role in persuading British Columbia to become part of Canada. Douglas declares Emancipation Day, August 1, the anniversary of the end of slavery in the British Empire, as the colonies&#x27; first official holiday August 1, to the chagrin of the white American element in the colony, though Victoria&#x27;s West Indian police force, recruited by Douglas, was necessarily disbanded because of the hostility from the numerous Americans in the emerging city. Also among the African-Americans who came with the gold rush was Isaac &quot;Ikey&quot; Dixon, whose brawl in his Yale barbershop and subsequent safe-custody arrest triggered off the events known as McGowan&#x27;s War, and who soon after became a noted and popular columnist for the Barkerville newspaper &quot;The Cariboo Sentinel&quot;.
*The Toronto Islands are created after a fierce storm detaches the island from the mainland at the Eastern gap.
*The British Columbia Provincial Police are established.

*November 1 – Joseph Tyrrell, geologist, cartographer and mining consultant (died 1957)

==Deaths==

<doc id="485950" wikidata="Q1315861" url="?curid=485950" title="Terry Bogard">
<text>is a fictional character created by SNK as the protagonist of their &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series. Introduced in &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot; in 1991, he is an American fighter who enters the worldwide &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; tournaments to combat his father&#x27;s murderer, Geese Howard. Following Geese&#x27;s defeat in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;, Terry becomes the guardian of Geese&#x27;s son Rock Howard. He is also a regular character in the crossover video game series &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, where he continues participating in tournaments with his brother Andy among other &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters. He has also been a guest character in other games, including the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, Arika&#x27;s &quot;Fighting EX Layer, Street Fighter 6&quot; and Nintendo&#x27;s crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. In addition to video games, Terry has appeared in anime films based on &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, and manga serialized in &quot;Comic Bom Bom&quot;.

SNK designer Takashi Nishiyama created Terry based on a scrapped design he used in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; before moving to the company. While his design and personality were inspired by Loren Avedon, a major redesign for &quot;&quot; was made by Yasuyuki Oda to reflect on his more peaceful life with Rock as the game takes place a decade after Geese&#x27;s death. This had an impact on his design which was also altered for &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games. His gameplay was based on traditional fighting game characters which kept being balanced with each installment. Terry&#x27;s popularity led SNK to create a female version of him for the 2018 game &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;.

The character has been well received, and is ranked highly in popularity polls. Publications have praised the character&#x27;s personality and movesets and how he was developed from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; to &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, although the female Terry saw mixed reception. Terry has become an icon for not just SNK, but fighting games in general, appearing prominently on SNK and non-SNK merchandise, often making rivalries with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Ken Masters both in crossovers and his iconic guest appearance in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;. His role in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; original video animations and movie were also the subject of praise with director Masami Obari&#x27;s own take on Terry&#x27;s chi-based techniques influencing his style in the games.

==Creation==
Terry Bogard originates in the development of Capcom&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987), for which developers Hiroshi Matsumoto and Takashi Nishiyama created a concept for a Caucasian man wearing a leather jacket; the concept was not used in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, as they decided to make the main playable character a dougi-clad karateka name Ryu instead. They still wanted to use this concept in a game; after their move to SNK, they implemented him in &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot; (1991) as a playable character. His inclusion in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was done since Nishiyama had created the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; during his time at Capcom and believed adding him alongside Mai Shiranui would fit in the game. However, all of Terry&#x27;s special moves were created by Capcom designers. Terry and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Ken Masters have had past dialogue between them, so they were very conscious of their relationship when they created them.

===Portrayal===
One of the earliest thoughts about Terry&#x27;s personality was that he is a calm man despite seeking revenge. In the making of the series, Terry and his brother Andy were characterized as the heroic leads, contrasting with the comical Joe Higashi. For the release of the &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; game, Terry was quickly added because of his popularity with fans. When it came to his moves, SNK had different ideas and altered the special moves he could perform. While Terry has an easygoing personality, he is fueled with the thirst of revenge with killing Geese Howard in most games. However, in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;, revenge is not necessarily Terry&#x27;s absolute goal, as is clear from the fact that he instinctively reaches out to Geese, who is supposed to be Jeff&#x27;s enemy. Although Terry and fellow fighter Blue Mary get along, SNK writer Akihiko Ureshino does not see the two as a romantic couple but instead as a friendly relationship comparable to Robert Garcia and Yuri Sakazaki from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; or Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou from &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot; because Blue Mary is in doubts about her late boyfriend killed by Geese. However, Ureshino has shown a desire to promote Terry and Mary&#x27;s relationship in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; or &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;.

The fourth title of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;, was made to end the conflict between Terry and his nemesis, Geese Howard. Ureshino believes Terry had no intention of killing Geese and getting revenge, and at most he just wanted to defeat Geese and make Jeff apologize after he died. Ureshino thinks Terry&#x27;s feelings were expressed when he instinctively reached out his hand to Geese as he was falling off the building. However, Geese refused even that, and selfishly ended his life, abandoning the future of Billy Kane and the connections he had built up. Terry has been popular with the SNK staff to the point multiple individuals worked on his character&#x27;s movesets during location tests of &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury 2&quot;. When Rock says that &quot;there is a possibility that he may change greatly in the future&quot;, he means that when he is confronted with a truth that he did not know until then, the values that Rock has cultivated while living with Terry may be completely overturned. If a sequel were had been released, perhaps Rock might have been transformed into a character who was at odds with Terry. According to Yasuyuki Oda, the phrase The King of Fighters is commonly associated with Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami than &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters. As a result, the new tournament was dubbed &quot;Maximum Mayhem King of Fighters&quot; to give a new tension to associate Terry and Rock.

Terry became a famous character thanks to &quot;KOF&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; which earned his fame in &quot;Smash&quot;. In the &quot;Smash&quot; games, Terry he became depicted as famous and cultural figure, and he has many different jobs. He is rich, no matter how the player looks at it. However, Ureshino describes the &quot;Garou&quot; Terry as a childish adult who is lazy most of the time and believes that in a sequel he might be given a more mature personality. When the 35-year-old Terry appeared in &quot;&quot; under the name &quot;Wild Wolf&quot;, his character story naturally followed this, and he also earned a living by giving lectures and writing essays, while at the same time showing a fatherly side, worrying about Rock&#x27;s future, who has been forced to join in his wandering life. His earlier life with Rock is portrayed as similar to the Sakazaki family from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; as they are comically worried about their money and fighting style at the same time.

&quot;The King of Fighters&quot; game was created with the idea of having Terry fighting against Ryo Sakazaki, the lead character from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series. &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; protagonist Kyo Kusanagi was also created with this in mind. Though Terry does not have a major role in the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series other than revenge with Billy Kane over Geese&#x27;s death in &quot;Real Bout&quot;, game designer Falcoon created the new lead Alba Meira to be Terry&#x27;s &quot;KOF&quot; counterpart. SNK said that Terry&#x27;s great popularity among players made him one of the most used characters for every installment of the series. For &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, when the staff was finishing Team Hero, creative director Eisuke Ogura wanted to use Terry because he is a disciple of Tung, just like newcomers Meitenkun and Shun’ei. He thought he would be in the best position to watch over them. However, in the end we chose Benimaru Nikaido as a proposal from fellow busy character Kyo Kusanagi, as Benimaru is just good enough to take care of others whereas Kyo was requested by fellow fighter Chizuru Kagura join her team. In the end, Ogura was glad with this decision.

===Designs===

Terry was designed to fit an American hero, sharing blond hair and represent the country&#x27;s flag through his clothing which includes red, blue and white, making him easy to recognize. This also includes references to superheroes often seen in Japanese series like mecha protagonists and echo a rise of popularity. The SNK staff described his original design as &quot;the most macho, stand-out, original Terry&quot;. Youchiro Soeda was in charge of the animation of most of the characters in the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. His original appearance was made with the intention that he did not look like a martial artist, contrasting the looks of his brother Andy. His appearance evolves across &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;; there were two rejected sketches. One involved a design with cowboy boots, a tattoo, and a pendant he had received from an unidentified woman. The role Loren Avedon played in &quot;The King of the Kickboxers&quot; (1990) inspired Terry&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; design. Nobyuki Kuroki handled Terry&#x27;s design in the &quot;Real Bout&quot; titled games. This was mostly because SNK aimed to make Terry&#x27;s muscles more notable, removing protection from his shoulders. Most of the main &quot;King of Fighters&quot; games up to &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot; feature Terry in his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; outfit. In &quot;XII&quot;, his classic outfit was used to remain true to his origins, while color editing was made in order to make him look like Pokemon character Ash Ketchum as a gag. For &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, the artists found Terry&#x27;s new appearance challenging to the point it was remade four times along with changes by his motion actor. Yusuke Amano was the character designer for Terry in this title which he enjoyed due to his personal experience with Terry ever since he played as him in his childhood. With &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; eventually moving from 2D visuals to 3D, the staff was careful to keep his original image intact for gameplay and visual needs.

In &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, Terry was redesigned with a &quot;cool&quot; look by the SNK staff because they thought his previous appearance had become outdated. Yasuyuki Oda was in charge of this version of Terry with respect to the game design. Regardless of major changes to Terry&#x27;s most unique traits, SNK wanted to keep the original stars drawn in the back of his jacket. Artist Falcoon considered this one of his favorite designs before he began working. He was pleased when he got the opportunity to work on the character&#x27;s redesign. Another reason for the change of clothing was to symbolize Terry&#x27;s more peaceful personality now displayed in &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;. &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; feature the &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot; design. In &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; and &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot; Terry wears both recurring outfits which bothered Ureshino. This is mostly due to the age difference Terry and Rock has as Terry is 24 years old in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; but 35 in &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. Meanwhile, Rock is only 17 &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;, making the time gap in &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; not fitting. As a result, even if Rock stands next to him, they look more like brothers than stepfather in &quot;KOF&quot;. That is why Ureshino feel uncomfortable when the two of them talk in demo scenes and the like. As a result, SNK solved this discomfort by setting &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; in an alternate timeline where Geese Howard is already dead, making it nearly the &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; timeline. Meanwhile, &quot;XV&quot; has Terry in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; design as regular and in his &quot;Garou&quot; design as DLC. While Terry retains his &quot;Garou&quot; look in &quot;City of the Wolves&#x27;. Players who pre-order &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; will receive an additional costume for Terry based on his appearance in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;.

While making &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, SNK staff noted that because Terry was one of the company&#x27;s most popular characters, his inclusion in the game was necessary even if he had to be redesigned as a woman; this incarnation has feminine clothing options including a variant of his original outfit wherein the &quot;FATAL FURY&quot; logo on his cap is changed to read &quot;FATAL CUTiE&quot;, a cheerleader outfit, and steampunk-inspired clothes. This was not the first time SNK had featured a female version of Terry in a game: in 2003&#x27;s &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;, he is magically transformed by the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; character Demitri Maximoff.

===Voice actors===
Starting with &quot;Fatal Fury: The King of Fighters&quot; until &quot;Neo Geo Heroes: Ultimate Shooting&quot; Terry was voiced by Satoshi Hashimoto who also voiced fellow playable character Kim Kaphwan. When he was replaced, Hashimoto said he was happy that his roles were widely recognized by fans and that he highly enjoyed Terry&#x27;s character. Takashi Kondō replaced Hashimoto for &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; onward and was very aware of his character&#x27;s popularity. Kondo first met the character through his childhood when playing the video games that feature him. He described his character as cool due to his demeanor.

For the three animated adaptations of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, the character&#x27;s role was left to Kazuyoshi Nishikori. In the English dubs of the three works, Terry is voiced by Mark Hildreth.
Early in &quot;SNK Heroines&quot; development, the female Terry was meant to still have a masculine voice, but the decision was reversed following disapproval from the game&#x27;s sound designers. Despite fears over the voice actresses&#x27; deliveries, in the end SNK felt Terry managed to fit in with the cast. Amano believed that SNK was able to explore a more humanistic take on the character through &quot;SNK Heroines&quot;.

===Fighting style===
Terry&#x27;s fighting style was designed by SNK to make him look cool. It was simply called &quot;Street Fighting&quot; in reference to how Terry improvises his moves and often gives them similar names. For the release of &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; Terry&#x27;s air move was removed in exchange for the . The Power Dunk was better for the team even though it closely resembled the Rising Tackle and balance the Power Rave. Another of Terry&#x27;s most iconic early moves is called the , where he generates a massive geyser of energy by punching the ground. Designer Nobuyuki Kuroki said there were several rejected versions of this move, but one of them was used in a later &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; game, &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury Special&quot;. The Burning Knuckle involves a banzai posure where he gathers energy in a similar manner to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters meant to emphasize &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;″s speed. His most basic and iconic move is the Power Wave which serves as a projectile like a Hadoken. It eventually became his stronger Desperation Move in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; under the name of , while in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; he obtained the simpler &quot;Power Dunk&quot; to make him more mobile should the Power Geyser failed. In &quot;Garou&quot;, Terry has a new move called the . Designer Yasuyuki Oda said its original name was actually &quot;God Geyser Twin&quot;, but he did not find it fitting for the Showa period when the move was added. In 2019, Oda noted that one of Terry&#x27;s most popular techniques is the Buster Wolf. Before performing the Buster Wolf, Terry says in English &quot;Are you Okay?&quot; as reference to the staff&#x27;s reaction to Jurassic Park: The Ride. The design required a certain amount of ruggedness, but Oda was careful to keep him from looking too old-fashioned. Regarding his moves, Oda put together his kit with the intention of producing the &quot;ultimate version of Terry&quot;. For this game, the intent was to make 35-year-old Terry feel a little more subdued, so he paid attention to those areas. but, he still somersaults when he jumps, and goes into a full sprint when he dashes, so he hasn&#x27;t really lost a step. He hopes Terry maintains his good health for more games.

When &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was announced, Terry was quickly added into the franchise by the SNK staff, who noted &quot;his popularity skyrocketed!&quot; His development was overseen by many designers who &quot;fretted over various aspects of his character&quot;. In retrospect the SNK staff noted he &quot;became the powerhouse, getting a super punch cancel move added to his arsenal and becoming the fearsome character he is today&quot;. The ability to cancel the second hit of his standing punch move was added by one of the game&#x27;s designers two hours before submitting the game&#x27;s mask ROM. There were also arguments about the character&#x27;s winpose, but in the end they decided on something new. Terry&#x27;s alter ego &quot;Wild Wolf&quot; from &quot;&quot; was designed to share Terry&#x27;s &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; with Rising Tackle and Round Wave having been removed, super special moves such as Power Stream and Rising Beat, which were in &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; and &quot;SVC Chaos&quot;&#x27;, have been added, and many special moves are now affected by braking. This applies to moves that you wonder if braking is even possible. Ureshino considers the best part of Wild Wolf is the high-power combo moves and seamless rushes that involve braking.

Game designer Masahiro Sakurai said he wanted to show the original appeal of Terry in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; when including him in the game. Sakurai preferred using his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; design in &quot;Smash&quot; as he believes it is one of the most recognizable ones, most notably in the 1990s. In doing so, Terry was made to automatically look at his opponents in one-on-one fights, including jumps where the character spins. He was designed to be slower than most characters. A new move known as the Somersault Kick was created for &quot;Smash&quot; although the original moves were also retained. An airbased variation of his original projectile technique, the Power Wave, was also used to balance the character. In order to accommodate his full moveset, Terry is the only character who has different side special moves depending on whether the player inputs left or right, and can use Desperation Moves if his health reaches a critical point rather than as his Final Smash, which is a completely new move melding together his different Desperation Moves.

In Masami Obari&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; animated adaptations, Terry is given an original move taught by Tung Fu Rue in his last moments: the in which Terry covers himself into a tornado to take down his enemies. The move was implemented in both &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; as a tribute to Obari but under the name of . Obari also took note of the anime move&#x27;s usage in gaming and posted on his X account that it was an honor and was overwhelmed being involved in fighting games series.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Terry has served as the lead character of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series since his debut in the first game. The original &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; centers around Terry and his younger brother Andy who enter the King of Fighters tournament to avenge their adoptive father Jeff Bogard&#x27;s death. He was murdered a decade before by the tournament&#x27;s sponsor, Geese Howard. Along with their friend Joe Higashi, they manage to defeat Geese who dies falling from a tower after fighting one of the three main characters. The numerous &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; sequels released later feature Terry and his friends competing in new tournaments. The first sequel, &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, introduced a new antagonist for Terry to defeat named Wolfgang Krauser who tries to conquer Southtown. By &quot;Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory&quot;, Terry continues his fight against Geese, who survived his apparent death and now seeks revenge against Terry and other rivals. &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot; concludes the Bogard and Howard rivalry by killing off Geese at the end of the game. Two subsequent &quot;Real Bout&quot; sequels featuring Terry were produced - &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury Special&quot; and &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers&quot; (although neither game contains a storyline), along with &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;, a 3D game which retells the plot of the first game. Terry Bogard&#x27;s character was reinvented for &quot;&quot;, which features an older Terry as the mentor of Geese Howard&#x27;s son, Rock Howard. During this time, Terry and Rock enter a new King of Fighters tournament related to the latter&#x27;s heritage. As revealed in the featurette &quot;Memories of Stray Wolves&quot;, Rock is the winner of the tournament, joining the host Kain after learning he is related with his mother, leaving Terry who tells this story to Blue Mary. Terry is set to make his return in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, Terry appeared in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, where he serves as the leader of the game&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; team alongside Andy and Joe. &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, which was originally conceived as a crossover of SNK&#x27;s previous video game franchises, eventually established their own self-contained continuity set apart from the earlier &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series. Terry became a staple of both franchises. While the Fatal Fury Team&#x27;s members change various times across the series, Terry remains the team&#x27;s leader. In NESTS Saga storyline, depicted in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; up to &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, Terry plays much larger role on helping Mary to take down NESTS&#x27;s hidden agents, mainly outside the tournaments. &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, including &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; bring back the character in his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; outfit. Terry returns in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; and &quot;XV&quot; mainly to oversee his nemesis, Geese.

The Fatal Fury Team remains as in the first &quot;KOF&quot; in the games without a storyline. They include: &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot; and &quot;Neowave&quot;. In &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, a role-playing game (RPG) centered on Kyo Kusanagi, Terry appears when Kyo goes to South Town and helps him fight Geese Howard. In the two games for the Game Boy Advance titled &quot;EX: Neo Blood&quot; and &quot;EX2&quot;, the Fatal Fury Team participates in the new tournaments. Terry also appears in the &quot;&quot; sub-series in both his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; and &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot; outfits, with the latter being labelled as . The character is also present in &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; in his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; and &quot;Garou&quot; personas and &quot;KOF 98: Ultimate Match Online&quot;.

He is also playable in the shooter game &quot;Sky Stage&quot;, and stars in the crossover video games &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot; in his &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot; outfit and the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series in his &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; outfit. The shooting game &quot;Neo Geo Heroes: Ultimate Shooting&quot; uses him as a playable character. An alternate female version of Terry is featured in the game &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;. Terry&#x27;s ending is a dream that revisits the events of Geese&#x27;s death, but an older Rock also throws him from a cliff before he awakes in the present where Rock had been trying to wake him up after finished cooking their breakfasts. Terry appears as a guest character in the Arika fighting game &quot;Fighting EX Layer&quot;. He is available in the &quot;King of Fighters X Fatal Fury&quot; mobile phone game, the Chinese mobile phone game called &quot;KOF: WORLD&quot;, &quot;Metal Slug Defense&quot;, the dating sim &quot;Days of Memories&quot; and the otome game &quot;King of Fighters for Girls&quot;. A pachinko based on the Orochi storyline of the series was released by SNK featuring Terry, while &quot;The Rhythm of Fighters&quot; has the character. Terry appears as a playable fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. He was released as downloadable content in November 2019, along with a stage based on &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; known as King of Fighters Stadium. Terry was added as a playable character in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; in September 2024 as part of its second season of downloadable content. The game has him travel across the setting of the series while interacting with followers who bring memories of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series until meeting &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Ken Masters.

===In other media===

Terry Bogard is the central character in a trilogy of Japanese animated &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; films. Two of them were original video animations (OVA) while the third was a theatrical release where his character is voiced by Shōnentai lead singer Nishikiori Kazukiyo in the Japanese originals and Mark Hildreth in the English dubs. The first two OVAs, 1992″s &quot;Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf&quot; and 1993″s &quot;Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle&quot; loosely follow the storylines of their respective games, while the third theatrical film, 1994″s &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot;, features an original storyline. The first OVA introduces a new love interest for Terry named Lily McGuire, an orphan raised by Geese Howard. Lily is killed by Geese during the first OVA, but she appears in both sequels as a spirit who guides Terry. The theatrical film introduced a new love interest for Terry named Sulia. She is the younger sister of the antagonist, Laocorn Gaudeamus, who sacrifices herself near the end of the film to help Terry defeat her brother. He is also present into the novelizations of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;.

Terry plays a supporting role in the 2006 original internet animation &quot;The King of Fighters: Another Day&quot;. He appears in the episode &quot;Accede&quot; voiced in the Japanese version by his video game voice actor, Satoshi Hashimoto, and by Tony Carroll in the English dub. Terry is featured in volume 3 of the soundtracks series &quot;SNK Character Sounds Collection&quot; released by Pony Canyon. The CD features several songs based on his character. He appears in several manhua, including the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; and &quot;SNK Vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;, which retell the stories of their respective games. The first seven chapters of the manhua &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; by Wing Yen feature a short chapter from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; that tells of Rock&#x27;s training with Terry. His character is part of a social action program created by SNK Playmore named the &quot;Nakoruru &amp; Terry Club&quot;. The organization supports children to guide them to a better future. David Leitch portrays Terry in the live-action 2010 film &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, where his role is that of a CIA agent who serves as the supporting side-kick and comic-relief of Iori, Kyo, and Mai&#x27;s team.

Terry is also one of the characters featured in &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;, an animated retelling of the first game in the series, voiced by his new voice actor in the games Takashi Kondo. In this story, Terry enters a tournament with Andy and Joe to avenge Jeff like the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. He begins a romantic relationship with a woman named Angelina who is an agent from Geese. As Geese is about to kill Terry, Angelina sacrifices herself to protect him and he takes down Geese. After the battle, Heidern takes Terry and Kyo to meet the real mastermind behind Geese&#x27;s power, Rugal Bernstein. Although Terry is defeated, Kyo manages to overpower Rugal. Terry plays a minor role in the manga &quot;The King of Fighters G&quot; where he faces Iori Yagami during the tournament and is nearly killed in combat by his enemy. However, when the tournament is interrupted, the Bogard brothers engage in a fight against Geese and Billy Kane.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
Terry is frequently used to represent the company in crossover games, merchandise and publicity. During the &quot;KOF&quot; Year-End Party in 2005, a fan event held by SNK, the character&#x27;s cap was given to every fan in attendance. He was voted the number one fan favorite character with a total of 10,014 votes in a 2005 poll conducted by SNK-Playmore USA, which lead to his placement in the North American release of &quot;The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact&quot; to appeal to the Western gamers. For the Japanese special endings in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, three video game publications, &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Neo Geo Freak&quot;, had to create a team composed of three characters for a special illustration. &quot;Gamest&quot; created a team composed of Terry, Blue Mary and Joe Higashi. In 2018, Terry was voted the most popular Neo Geo character. In late 2018, Terry and other characters created by SNK appeared as part of a collaboration between other companies in Harajuku Japan involving new merchandising.

===Critical response===
The character has received both praise and criticism from several media publications. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Frank Provo commented that one of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;″s biggest accomplishments is the creation of Terry Bogard and their use of him in later sequels. IGN regarded him as one of the most iconic fighting game characters of all time based on his design and moves. Damien McFerran praised Terry&#x27;s design, saying that he is &quot;emanating so much coolness it&#x27;s little wonder that SNK &quot;otaku&quot; can always be seen wearing his trademark red cap&quot;. &quot;UGO.com&quot; listed Terry&#x27;s baseball cap thirteenth on their list of &quot;The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games&quot;, calling it &quot;completely badass&quot;, despite having &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; stitched on the front. Den of Geek placed Terry third on their &quot;best fighting game characters&quot; list. Editor Harry Slater commented that &quot;Bogard is a stark reminder of the glory days of the two dimensional fighter&quot;. The English actor&#x27;s voice in &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; received a good review in &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; magazine for fitting Terry so well. 4thletter listed Terry&#x27;s ending in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot; as the best one in gaming as it not only ends his rivalry with Geese but also shows more of his relationship with Rock Howard.

&quot;GamesRadar&quot; called Terry &quot;one of SNK&#x27;s most memorable characters&quot;, ranking him the 86th &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; protagonist in games. They also listed him as the second best fighting character because of the appeal of his techniques. His role in the story, for example his adoption of Rock Howard, was also praised. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Terry the 11th &quot;Most Dominant Fighting Game Character&quot; commenting that his appearance in the least would be predictable based on his fame. Arcade Sushi ranked him as the &quot;4th best fighting game good guy&quot; noted for more than &quot;his hilarious English butchery&quot;. They praised his outfit and cited his moves as entertaining. Den of Geek listed him as the third best &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; character with the writer commenting on his &quot;overthetop&quot; moves as well as comparing him positively with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters Ryu and Ken Masters based on their personalities. The same site listed him as the third best fighting game character, remarking on his figure within SNK&#x27;s games and his impact within gamers. Several sites have commented on Terry&#x27;s gameplay moves. &quot;Prima Games&quot; listed his &quot;Burn Knuckle&quot; as one of the 50 greatest fighting moves in video game history because Terry dashes towards his enemies in the process. Terry was given a move known as the &quot;Buster Wolf&quot; which was listed as one of the best techniques in fighting games by Arcade Sushi not only because of its impact, but also before landing the attack, the character ironically says &quot;Are you okay?&quot; &quot;Polygon&quot; recommended that newcomers to &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; try Terry&#x27;s movesets, despite some difficulties with mastering certain moves.

The female portrayal of Terry in &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot; was met with surprise. &quot;Push Square&quot; joked about the implications of the developers changing Terry&#x27;s gender while &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; wondered why they did not use Alice Nakata, a female fighter who has some of Terry&#x27;s moves. Nevertheless, the site found Terry&#x27;s fighting style in the crossover to be promising. Despite also finding the fighter&#x27;s appearance confusing, &quot;Game Informer&quot; commented that every SNK game might need Terry regardless of gender. &quot;Destructoid&quot; noted that while Terry retained his original moves, most fans were unaware that the female Terry appeared for the first time in a Japanese mobile game. &quot;Daily World News&quot; agreed with &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; questioning why SNK did not use Alice instead. They noted the most common response had been mixed and wondered if this was meant to be a joke similar to Iori Yagami&#x27;s cross-dressing alter-ego, Miss X, from &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot;. The character&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was praised by &quot;Anime News Network&quot; for its level of attention to the detail despite noting negative backlash about his large chin, but still found it as a fanservice to SNK fans, most specifically gamers from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. Kotaku enjoyed this decision especially due to how Terry is the rival of Ken Masters from &quot;Street Fighter&quot; as highlighted in promotional artwork of previous crossovers. The similarities between Terry and Ken were noted to make them iconic rivals especially with their meeting in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; as both characters suffer personal crisis as well as in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; where Ken was selected as guest instead.

&quot;Anime News Network&quot; Bamboo Dong praised Terry&#x27;s character development in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; original video animations because they portrayed his insecurities, something rarely seen in other adaptations. Chris Beveridge of &quot;Mania Beyond Entertainment&quot; also praised the characters&#x27; development citing Terry&#x27;s grief over the loss of his love interest. In contrast THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Raphael criticized Terry&#x27;s story for being told several times already in other series and also panned his final fight against Geese Howard because of the lack of regular martial arts and the use of chi-like energy instead. For &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;Anime News Network&quot; found Terry&#x27;s tragic characterization and fate sad enough to make him sensitive as it contrasted his views on fighting game characters in general with Terry losing for the second time a woman he loves despite having the power to defeat the villain. Although the live-action film of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; has been panned, Beyond Hollywood said that &quot;KOF″s&quot; &quot;only saving grace ... is David Leitch, who is flat-out hilarious as world-weary CIA agent Terry Bogard. Yeah, the character doesn&#x27;t make a lick of sense, but in this film, it borders on genius&quot;. Felix Vasquez of &quot;Cinema Crazed&quot;, however, criticized Terry&#x27;s character in the movie calling him a &quot;nuisance&quot;. Tyler Treese of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; has praised Terry&#x27;s addition in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; by stating that &quot;There are so many ridiculous possibilities for him to battle, and that&#x27;s exactly what makes &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; such a fun series.&quot; A commercial for the mobile phone game &quot;SNK Allstar&quot; generated disgust in social media for Terry being portrayed as a man sexually harassing women. This led to the game&#x27;s cancellation when SNK&#x27;s heard about it.

&quot;Game Type&quot; magazine praised Rock and Terry&#x27;s relationship as they really seem like son and father and wondered whether or not Terry&#x27;s love interest Blue Mary would end up joining them. However, they lamented the game ending on a cliffhanger with Rock joining Kain and leaving Terry&#x27;s side despite their bond. In regards to the character&#x27;s life, GeneracionXbox believes that his relationship with Terry is still stable despite having abandoned him favor of Kain as his uncle motivated with the idea of finding his missing mother in the end of &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. While liking the imported moves from &quot;Garou&quot;, the writer enjoyed that Rock could now perform the Power Geyser. GameReactor asked Yasyuki Oda in anticipation but the planner decided to leave it ambiguous. According to &quot;Sensatez&quot;, &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; might have a heavy emphasis about Rock&#x27;s relationship with Terry, as he will try to stay loyal to his adoptive father despite having abandoned him. They also teased the chance of Rock and Terry becoming enemies in a tower mirroring the final fight between Terry and Geese from &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;.

<text>The Neo Geo is a video game platform developed and designed by SNK and supported from 1990 to 2004. It was released in three different iterations: a ROM cartridge-based arcade system board called the Multi Video System (MVS), a cartridge-based home video game console called the Advanced Entertainment System (AES), and a CD-ROM-based home console called the Neo Geo CD. Each system features similar hardware and runs the same library of games through different media formats. Most games were first released on the MVS then rereleased for the home consoles, however some never saw a home console release and a few were released exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. This page lists every officially licensed game released for all three formats.

== Games ==
There are 156 officially licensed Neo Geo games. This does not include unlicensed games, prototypes, Neo Geo Pocket Color games, or Hyper Neo Geo 64 games.

<doc id="485962" wikidata="Q1242951" url="?curid=485962" title="Double stop">
<text>In music, a double stop is the technique of playing two notes simultaneously on a stringed instrument such as a violin, a viola, a cello, or a double bass. On instruments such as the Hardanger fiddle it is common and often employed. In performing a double stop, two separate strings are bowed or plucked simultaneously. Although the term itself suggests these strings are to be fingered (stopped), in practice one or both strings may be open.

A triple stop is the same technique applied to three strings; a quadruple stop applies to four strings. Double, triple, and quadruple stopping are collectively known as multiple stopping.
Early extensive examples of the double stop and string chords appear in Carlo Farina&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Stravagante&quot; from 1627, and in certain of the sonatas of Biagio Marini&#x27;s Op. 8 of 1629.

==Bowing==
On instruments with a curved bridge, it is difficult to bow more than two strings simultaneously. Early treatises make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this. Playing four notes at once is almost impossible. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to sound the lower notes briefly and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes (a broken chord). This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. In forte, however, it is possible to play three notes at once, especially when bowed toward the fingerboard. With this technique more pressure than usual is needed on the bow, so this cannot be practiced in softer passages. This technique is mainly used in music with great force, such as the cadenza-like solo at the beginning of the last movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s violin concerto.

===Bach bow===
The &quot;Bach bow&quot; with its arched back uses a system of levers to slacken or tighten bow hair immediately while playing so as to (according to its advocates) facilitate the performance of polyphonic music. Such a bow was conceived early in the 20th century by Arnold Schering and Albert Schweitzer and constructed by Rolf Schröder in 1933. A similar device called the &quot;Vega bow&quot; was built in 1954 under the sponsorship of the violinist Emil Telmányi. Neither of these bows bears any particular relation to historical Baroque bows and neither has ever been widely employed. In 1990, German cellist Michael Bach invented a curved bow for cello, violin, viola and bass. He named it &quot;BACH.Bogen&quot; (BACH.Bow) after his own name.

===Notation===

In longer three-note or four-note chords, either the top note or the top two notes are sustained after the lower notes have been played as grace notes. Sometimes the noteheads for the lower notes are filled in to show they are of short duration while the noteheads for the notes to be held are left open. This notation occurs, for example, at the beginning of the fourth movement of Beethoven&#x27;s fifth symphony.

Simultaneous notes in a single part for an orchestral string section may be played as multiple stops or the individual notes may be distributed among the players within the section. Where the latter is intended, &quot;divisi&quot; or &quot;div.&quot; is written above the staff.

==Plucking==
Guitar double stops are commonly used in rock, blues, metal, and jazz music. They are often played by fingerpicking or hybrid picking, but can also be strummed, or executed with hammer-ons or pull-offs. Jimi Hendrix was especially known for utilizing double stops on the guitar.

When three or more notes are played simultaneously on a plucked string instrument, it is simply called a chord rather than a triple stop or quadruple stop.

== Marching Percussion ==
Double stops are commonly used in marching percussion writing. In the case of the snare, a double stop is when a drummer hits the drum with both hands at the same time, while the tenors hit 2 drums at once. These are usually notated with either single note or a stacked note. A double stop will have the letter B written under the note for sticking.

<doc id="485971" wikidata="Q109058" url="?curid=485971" title="Ulrich Wegener">
<text>Ulrich Klaus Wegener (22 August 1929 – 28 December 2017) was a German police officer of the Federal Border Protection (holding the rank of Brigadier General and the official title of Commander of the Federal Border Protection, Border Protection Command West). He was also the commander and founding member of the federal counter-terrorism force GSG 9 (&quot;Grenzschutzgruppe 9&quot;).

==Early life==
Wegener was born in Jüterbog, Province of Brandenburg, Weimar Germany. He was the son of an army officer and came from a family steeped in Prussian military tradition. During the Second World War, between the ages of 14 and 15, Wegener was briefly a compulsory member of the Hitler Youth and, living near Berlin, endured the relentless Allied air raids.

In 1949, Wegener&#x27;s home state of Brandenburg fell within the borders of communist East Germany (German Democratic Republic), where he began his studies in economics. In the early 1950s, as a member of an anti-communist group, he distributed dissident leaflets against the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in the Soviet-occupied sector of East Berlin. He was subsequently arrested for &quot;socially hostile activity&quot; after the group was informed on, initially imprisoned in Potsdam and later in Brandenburg. He spent more than a year and a half in a GDR State Security (Stasi) prison, where they tried to break him before his release. In 1952, Wegener fled to West Berlin before taking entrance exams in West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) for both an officer&#x27;s career in the West German Readiness (Riot) Police (&quot;Bereitschaftspolizei&quot;) and the newly formed Federal Defence Forces (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;).

==Career==
Wegener&#x27;s police career began in 1952 with the Readiness (Riot) Police (&quot;Bereitschaftspolizei&quot;) of the state of Baden-Württemberg, where he served as a police sergeant (&quot;Polizeiwachtmeister&quot;) on probation. Due to a lack of opportunities for advancement, Wegener applied for a career as an officer in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and the Federal Border Protection (BGS, &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;). After passing the entrance exams, he decided to join the BGS in 1958. Following his attendance at officer school in Lübeck, he was promoted to lieutenant (&quot;Leutnant&quot;) in the BGS in 1959. He became the company commander of the 7th/GSG 2 (7th company of the Border Protection Group 2) and later the 15th/GSG 2 (15th company of the Border Protection Group 2) in Coburg, Bavaria. In 1969, he attended staff officer training (&quot;Stabsoffiziersausbildung&quot;) and held the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (First Lieutenant). From 1970 to 1972, Wegener was the liaison officer for the BGS at the Federal Ministry of the Interior. In 1972, he was training at the NATO Defense College in Rome, Italy, before returning to Germany shortly before the 1972 Summer Olympic Games. Wegener was the first Federal Border Protection (&quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;) officer to participate in this high-level training.

==Formation of GSG 9 following the Munich Olympic massacre==
Wegener was the Federal Border Protection (BGS, &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;) liaison officer at the Federal Ministry of the Interior during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. While serving as an adjutant to Federal Interior Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, he witnessed the failure of the regular Bavarian State Police in the face of an unprecedented threat from Palestinian terrorists during the hostage-taking of the Israeli Olympic team—a type of threat previously unknown in Germany. Even the presence of the Federal Border Protection (BGS) would not have changed the catastrophic outcome of the hostage-taking. Two weeks after the disaster, Genscher, in agreement with Wegener&#x27;s suggestion, entrusted him on 26 September 1972 with the rapid formation of the specialized counter-terrorism tactical intervention unit, Border Protection Group 9 (GSG 9, &quot;Grenzschutzgruppe 9&quot;), appointing him as its commander.

The designation &quot;GSG 9&quot; is derived from the structure of the Federal Border Protection (BGS, &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;), which, at the time of the unit&#x27;s founding, consisted of four border protection commands with a total of eight border protection groups (GSG 1 to 7 and Sea). Since the GSG 9 was not integrated into any of the existing structures, it was designated Border Protection Group 9 (&quot;Grenzschutzgruppe 9&quot;, GSG 9).

In the early 1970s, counter-terrorism units were still a relatively unheard-of form of combating terrorism, with the only truly established groups at the time being Israel&#x27;s &quot;Sayeret Matkal&quot;, which had some experience in counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue, and Britain&#x27;s Special Air Service (SAS), albeit with experience primarily in guerrilla warfare. However, these were special military combat units rather than specialized counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue units. Counter-terrorism and tactical policing specifically were still relatively unheard-of methods, and no military in the world had a unit specialized in handling hostage crises. Since there were no specialized units in the modern sense—only special military combat units—GSG 9 became the first specialized counter-terrorism tactical intervention and hostage rescue unit. To this end, Wegener trained with both groups, assimilating many of their methods into the doctrine he would establish for the GSG 9. Following the Munich Olympic massacre, the British SAS also developed its own specialized counter-terrorism unit.

Wegener&#x27;s short time with the British SAS is well documented, but his training with the Israeli &quot;Sayeret Matkal&quot; (and alleged participation in the rescue of the Israeli hostages during Operation Entebbe in Uganda in 1976) is less publicized.

===Interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk===
In an interview in November 2000 with Holger Lösch from Bayerischer Rundfunk, Wegener was asked: &quot;You are an intimate connoisseur of military history. Which role models inspired you when planning the GSG 9 unit? Was it Stirling, the forefather of the SAS, or the Brandenburgers?&quot; Wegener replied: &quot;Everyone played a certain role in it. I looked into the history of the German special forces in the army archives, I looked into the history of the Brandenburgers and the English with Stirling, the forerunners of the SAS. But none of it fit because the tasks were completely different. The Israelis were always my role model, and they were the ones who, despite this traumatic experience that they also went through, were immediately ready to help us.&quot;

&quot;The task of dealing with terrorism was always at the forefront for me. Because the Israelis always had the most experience in fighting terrorism and had already solved several cases with their special forces, it was clear to me that we had to work together. It was clear to me that the situation and circumstances in Israel were completely different from those in Germany. We couldn&#x27;t adopt a lot of things, but we adopted many tactical tricks from the Israelis, and also in leadership matters, I always leaned toward the Israelis. Specifically, an Israeli officer said to me at the time: &quot;We adopted a lot from you, including from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; era.&quot;&quot;

When asked about the rumors of his presence in Entebbe in 1976, Wegener replied: &quot;There are some things I am not allowed to say yet because they have not been released. I can only say this much: I was in Entebbe in the interests of the Germans and Israelis, but also before the Israeli attack was carried out. We tried to gather information about the enemy, the terrorists, as well as about the possible supporters who were present in Uganda. We were very successful and were able to gather a great deal of information.&quot;

==Storming of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 in Mogadishu==

Wegener was the GSG 9 commander during the liberation of the hostages taken by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine on the Boeing 737 &quot;Landshut&quot; hijacking, operated by Lufthansa as flight 181, in Mogadishu, Somalia, on the night of October 17–18, 1977. Wegener directed and led the operation from the ground as his GSG 9 assault teams stormed the plane. Two terrorists were killed, one was fatally wounded, and the fourth was captured alive but critically wounded. Having both planned and led the successful operation to liberate the hostages of the Lufthansa 181 hijacking, Wegener was promoted from the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (&quot;Oberstleutnant&quot;) to Colonel (&quot;Oberst&quot;). Along with his GSG 9 assault team members, he was awarded the German Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Federal Cross of Merit (&quot;Großes Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot;).

==Commander of the Federal Border Protection==
In 1979, whilst holding the rank of &quot;Oberst&quot; (Colonel), Wegener relinquished command of the GSG 9 unit he had established to his deputy, Klaus Blätte, and was appointed as the permanent representative of the Inspector of the Federal Border Protection in the Federal Ministry of the Interior. In 1981, he was promoted to Brigadier General (&quot;Brigadegeneral&quot;) and took command of the Federal Border Protection&#x27;s Border Protection Command West, a position he held until his retirement in 1989.

==Later life==
Wegener was considered one of the world&#x27;s leading sought-after experts on counter-terrorism and advised on the establishment of numerous special units in other countries, including head of the German Advisory Group at the Royal Saudi Special Security Forces (SSF). After his retirement, he continued to be a counterterrorism expert and international security advisor. From the 1980s onwards, he lived in Windhagen in the Westerwald, gave lectures, and became a member of the political party Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). Wegener was also a member of the Security Committee of the German .

Wegener was widowed to Magda and is survived by his daughters, Simone and Susanne. His daughter, Simone Stewens, is a television journalist and was the director of the International Film School Cologne. Aged 88, Wegener died on 28 December 2017.

<text>Irish people in Great Britain or British Irish are immigrants from the island of Ireland living in Great Britain as well as their British-born descendants.

Irish migration to Great Britain has occurred from the earliest recorded history to the present. There has been a continuous movement of people between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain due to their proximity. This tide has ebbed and flowed in response to politics, economics and social conditions of both places.

Today, millions of residents of Great Britain are either from Ireland or are entitled to an Irish passport due to having a parent or grandparent who was born in Ireland. It is estimated that as many as six million people living in the UK have at least one Irish grandparent (around 10% of the UK population).

The Irish diaspora () refers to Irish people and their descendants who live outside Ireland. This article refers to those who reside in Great Britain, the largest island and principal territory of the United Kingdom.

==Migration eras==
===Medieval===

After the end of Roman rule in Britain, significant Irish settlement of western Britain took place.

The Déisi recorded as having founded the Gwynedd (Anglesea) and Dyfed (Pembrokeshire) colonies, with contemporary Ogham inscriptions identifying the genealogies of the colonists, and later echoed in the 8th century, Old Irish work, The Expulsion of the Déisi.

Similarly, the traditional view is that Gaelic language and culture was brought to Scotland, probably in the 4th century, by settlers from Ireland, who founded the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata on Scotland&#x27;s west coast. This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. However, recently some archeologists have argued against this view, saying that there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites. Due to the growth of Dál Riata, in both size and influence, Scotland became almost wholly Gaelic-speaking. However, in the Lowlands – which had been the northernmost part of the Kingdom of Northumbria, the Northumbrian language remained dominant, and formed the basis of the Scots language. While Scots gradually became more and more widespread, Gaelic remained the dominant language of the Highlands into the 19th century.

Before and during the Gregorian mission of 596 AD, Irish Christians such as Columba (521–97), Buriana, Diuma, Ceollach, Saint Machar, Saint Cathan, Saint Blane, Jaruman, Wyllow, Kessog, St Govan, Donnán of Eigg, Foillan and Saint Fursey began the conversion of the English and Pictish peoples. Modwenna and others were significant in the following century.

Some English monarchs, such as Oswiu of Northumbria (c. 612 – 15 February 670), Aldfrith (died 704 or 705) and Harold Godwinson (died 1066) were either raised in or sought refuge in Ireland, as did Welsh rulers such as Gruffudd ap Cynan. Alfred the Great may have spent some of his childhood in Ireland.

In the year 902 Norsemen who had been forced out of Ireland were given permission by the English to settle in Wirral, in the north west of England. An Irish historical record known as &quot;The Three Fragments&quot; refers to a distinct group of settlers living among these Vikings as &quot;Irishmen&quot;. Further evidence of this Irish migration to Wirral comes from the name of the village of Irby in Wirral, which means &quot;settlement of the Irish&quot;, and St Bridget&#x27;s church, which is known to have been founded by &quot;Vikings from Ireland&quot;. The Irish of the 10th century may have settled as far afield as Northumbria and Lincolnshire, as place names such as Irby upon Humber, Ireleth and Irton mention the Irish as an ethnic group, while Goidelic personal names appear in some northern English place-names, including Duggleby, Fixby and Melmerby, and in a Viking-age Runic inscription from County Durham.

The island of Ireland was itself claimed as an Ecclesiastical fief, via the forged, mid 8th century, Donation of Constantine, with the feudal Lordship of Ireland later leased to Henry II of England and his heirs, by Pope Alexander III&#x27;s, 1171 grant, resulting in the presence and settlement of Irish traders and seamen in English and Welsh ports, as well as the establishment of The Pale, on the island, the Irish settlers being subject to a poll tax, from 1440; in 1542, Henry VIII, following his excommunication, would have the Irish Parliament create the Kingdom, with himself elected as King. Subsequently through offering English titles, and ecclesiastical lands, in a surrender and regrant process, would offer Irish clan chiefs, property and political power, in England, as well as Ireland. In 1555, Pope Paul IV, would confirm the existence of the Irish Kingdom, and that it was to be held in personal union with the Kingdom of England, via a Papal bull. A personal Union that would later include the Kingdom of Scotland, and between 1707 and 1800, the politically united Kingdom of Great Britain. The Irish Parliament and Kingdom would be politically united with Great Britain as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, between 1801 and 1922, through the Acts of Union 1800. Today, Ireland is divided between the independent Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, a constituent of the United Kingdom.

Irish people who made Britain their home in the later medieval era included Aoife MacMurrough, Princess of Leinster (1145–88), the poet Muireadhach Albanach (fl. 1213), the lawyer William of Drogheada (died 1245), Máel Muire Ó Lachtáin (died 1249), Malachias Hibernicus (fl. 1279–1300), Gilbert Ó Tigernaig (died 1323), Diarmait MacCairbre (executed 1490) and Germyn Lynch (fl. 1441–1483), all of whom made successful lives in the various kingdoms of Britain.

===16th to 18th centuries===
Historically, Irish immigrants to the United Kingdom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considered over-represented amongst those appearing in court. However, research suggests that policing strategy may have put immigrants at a disadvantage by targeting only the most public forms of crime, while locals were more likely able to engage in the types of crimes that could be conducted behind locked doors. An analysis of historical courtroom records suggests that despite higher rates of arrest, immigrants were not systematically disadvantaged by the British court system in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Some notable people born in Ireland who settled in Great Britain between the 16th and 19th centuries:

* Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde, died 1635
* Robert Boyle, FRS, died 1691
* Laetitia Pilkington, died 1750
* Richard Brinsley Sheridan
* George Monro (British Army officer), 1700–57
* Patrick Brontë, 1777–1861
* Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington
* Thomas Moore, died 1852
* Bram Stoker, author of &quot;Dracula&quot;
* Oliver Goldsmith, author of &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;
* Edmund Burke, politician, reformer, writer
* Mary Burns
* Robert Tressell, author of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists

===19th century===
The most significant exodus followed the worst of a series of potato crop failures in the 1840s – the Great Irish Famine. It is estimated that more than one million people died and almost the same again emigrated. A further wave of emigration to England also took place between the 1930s and 1960s by Irish escaping poor economic conditions following the establishment of the Irish Free State. This was furthered by the severe labour shortage in Britain during the mid-20th century, which depended largely on Irish immigrants to work in the areas of construction and domestic labour. The extent of the Irish contribution to Britain&#x27;s construction industry in the 20th century may be gauged from Sir William MacAlpine&#x27;s 1998 assertion that the contribution of the Irish to the success of his industry had been &quot;immeasurable&quot;. This statement by a member of the British upper class illustrates how Irish migrant labour was regularly employed to discipline and weaken organised English labour unions at the same time as disparaging the contribution of the latter to the development of their own nation. Of this process the German-born philosopher Karl Marx wrote in 1870:

&quot;Ireland constantly sends her own surplus to the English labour market, and thus forces down wages and lowers the material and moral position of the English working class... This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organisation. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And the latter is quite aware of this.&quot; 

Ireland&#x27;s population fell from more than 8 million to just 6.5 million between 1841 and 1851. A century later it had dropped to 4.3 million. By the late 19th century, emigration was heaviest from Ireland&#x27;s most rural southern and western counties. Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Tipperary and Limerick alone provided nearly half of Ireland&#x27;s emigrants. Some of this movement was temporary, made up of seasonal harvest labourers working in Britain and returning home for winter and spring.

Some notable people born in Ireland who settled in Great Britain in the 19th century:

* Oscar Wilde (1854–1900)

===20th to 21st centuries===
By the mid-1930s, Great Britain was the choice of many who had to leave Ireland. Britain&#x27;s wartime economy (1939–45) and post-war boom attracted many Irish people to expanding cities and towns such as London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Luton. Prior to the 2000s financial crisis, ongoing sectarian violence and its economic aftermath was another major factor for immigration.

According to the UK 2001 Census, white Irish-born residents make up 1.2% of those living in England and Wales. In 1997, the Irish Government in its &quot;White Paper on Foreign Policy&quot; claimed that there were around two million Irish citizens living in Britain. The 2001 Census also showed that Irish people are more likely to be employed in managerial or professional occupations than those classed as &quot;White British&quot;.

As a result of the Irish financial crisis, emigration from Ireland rose significantly. Data published in June 2011 showed that Irish emigration to Britain had risen by 25 per cent to 13,920 in 2010.

Some notable people born in Ireland who settled in Great Britain between the 20th and 21st centuries include:

====Irish broadcasters====
BBC broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan moved to Buckinghamshire, England in 1969, acquiring British citizenship and a knighthood in 2005, and remained resident in the UK until his death in 2016. Comedians Ed Byrne and Dara Ó Briain have relocated to Britain from Ireland, and regularly feature on British television.

====Black and Asian communities====
Since the 1970s some UK organisations, sections of media, and government departments have defined Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) in anti-racist efforts and general demography. There are several notable Irish migrants to Great Britain who are people of colour, or who might otherwise be considered part of BAME communities. This includes emigrants from Ireland from the black Irish community, as well as Asian Irish people.

Irish musician and singer Phil Lynott settled in Surrey, England after the commercial success of his Dublin-formed band Thin Lizzy. Lynott, who died in 1986, was mixed raced and had British Guianan ancestry. Irish actor Christopher Simpson was moved to London, England as child in 1981. Simpson is of Irish and Rwandan descent.

Irish footballer Darren Randolph, who has spoken of his experiences growing up black in Ireland, moved to Britain permanently after joining London team Charlton Athletic F.C. in 2003, and has since remained in English football. Model and actress Layla Flaherty relocated to Liverpool, England in 2006. Flaherty, who has Irish and African American heritage, has appeared in UK-based E4 productions, such as &quot;Desperate Scousewives&quot;. Also relocating to England in 2006, Ethiopian-Irish actress Ruth Negga has appeared in films, as well as RTÉ and BBC series. In 2018, Negga, who has been Academy Award-nominated, was featured in the Evening Standard&#x27;s &quot;Progress 1000&quot; list, which claims to chart the careers of London&#x27;s most influential people. Irish presenter Liz Bonnin has also relocated to London. Bonnin, who has Indian, Portuguese, and French-Martiniquan heritage moved to Britain after establishing a science-based broadcasting career with the BBC since 2009.

In 2020, Irish women&#x27;s football player Rianna Jarrett relocated to Brighton, England. Jarrett, whose father is Jamaican, made the move to Britain after joining Brighton &amp; Hove Albion W.F.C.

====Irish footballers====
Notable Irish footballers, who were born or raised in Ireland, began moving as young adults to teams based in Great Britain since the post-World War II period. As the sport became more commercially successful, wealthy English clubs in particular pursued Irish talent, which was often seen as detrimental to the game&#x27;s development in Ireland.

Moving from Northern Ireland between 1949 and 1963, players such as Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy McIlroy, Billy Bingham, Terry Neill, George Best, Pat Jennings and later, migrating between 1971 and 1981; Sammy McIlroy, Mal Donaghy, Norman Whiteside, David McCreery, Nigel Worthington, Jimmy Nicholl and Martin O&#x27;Neill won titles as players, or managers, in England and Scotland&#x27;s top competitions.

Moving to Britain from the Republic of Ireland during the 1950s and 60s, Tony Dunne, Noel Cantwell, Johnny Giles, and later, in the 1970s and 80s, Liam Brady, Packie Bonner, Ronnie Whelan, Frank Stapleton, David O&#x27;Leary and Steve Staunton all won major honours in the Scottish or English top-flights.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, players also from the Republic, such as John O&#x27;Shea, Stephen Carr, Steve Finnan, Denis Irwin, Niall Quinn, Roy Keane, Shay Given, Robbie Keane and Damien Duff, moved to enjoy decades-long careers in English and Scottish football, each winning at least one top-flight competition. In the same era, players who moved from Northern Ireland to Britain, winning competitions in the Scottish and English top-tiers, included Steven Davis, David Healy, Jonny Evans, Keith Gillespie, Roy Carroll, Gerry Taggart, Kyle Lafferty and Neil Lennon.

==Types of migration==
===Seasonal workers===
Prior to the 19th century, much of Irish migration of the modern period had been large-scale movement of temporary labourers to Britain. These seasonal workers or labourers, known as Spalpeens and Tatie Hookers, were often based on extended family ties, and would involve up to half a year working on farms or in agricultural industry. Up until as late as the 1970s, earnings from this type of employment helped sustain communities in Western Ireland.

===Great Famine refugees===
The Great Famine in 1845 triggered a mass exodus from Ireland, with significant numbers of Irish migrants fleeing to Britain to escape severe poverty and starvation.

==Regional migration histories==
===Irish in England===
In 2021, there were 505,212 people in England (0.9 per cent of the population), who had been born in Ireland, down from 674,786 in 2001. Of these, 314,674 were born in the Republic of Ireland, and 190,538 born in Northern Ireland. Despite the drop since 2001, this is still the greatest concentration of Irish-born—as distinct from persons of Irish ancestry—abroad anywhere in the world and was equivalent to 7.2% of the population of the island of Ireland (7.1 million) in 2021, or 6.1% of the Republic of Ireland population and 10% of the Northern Irish population.

====Barrow-in-Furness====
During the Great Famine of the 19th century, Barrow-in-Furness was seen as a desirable location that many Irish (along with Scottish and Cornish) fled to. This was in part due to ease of access to reach the town&#x27;s port from Ireland (particularly from Ulster), and secondly because it was a booming town as a result of the Industrial Revolution with guaranteed work, particularly in the emerging steelworks and shipbuilding industries in the town. At its peak, it was estimated that somewhere between 7-11% of Barrow&#x27;s population were Irish or Scottish. As a result of this, to this day a huge number of Barrow&#x27;s population are of Irish descent.

====Birmingham====
Birmingham has a large Irish community, dating back to the Industrial Revolution, it is estimated that Birmingham has the largest Irish population per capita in Britain. Digbeth is the traditional Irish area in Birmingham. During the 1950s Sparkhill, Sparkbrook, Aston, and Nechells were the main Irish areas. Today many Irish people live in areas such as Hall Green and Erdington. Birmingham has the UK&#x27;s largest St Patricks Day&#x27;s Parade (and the world&#x27;s third biggest) and Britain&#x27;s only Irish Quarter, with many traditional Irish pubs and the Birmingham Irish centre. Irish people have always moved to Birmingham for work especially for the construction, factory and industrial work which the city had to offer. Many Irish people moved to Birmingham to build canals, roads and railways in the city&#x27;s industrial past. St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral is one of only two of the minor Basilicas in the UK. It is very important as the first Catholic church built in Britain after the English Reformation, and was designed by the architect Augustus Pugin.

Community relations for the Irish in Birmingham were complicated by the pub bombings of November 1974. At inquests into the deaths of the 21 victims, &quot;Witness O&quot; named the men responsible as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Gavin. He said he had been given permission to reveal the names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin. There were very limited physical attacks on Irish people in the aftermath of the bombings. In November 2018, Birmingham&#x27;s Irish Association revealed a memorial to those killed outside Birmingham New Street Station.

====Bolton====
A large number settled here in the 1950s as work was scarce at home, especially in the South. Many found work in the mills and factories and encouraged other family members to come over as there were jobs waiting for them.

====Bradford====
Bradford largely expanded into the city it is today during the 19th century, due to jobs in the newly built textile mills attracting many immigrants in dire need of work. The population increase, in fact, saw Bradford go from a small town of 6,000 in 1801, to 103,000 by 1851 according to records taken. Many of these newly arriving people were Irish escaping the Great Famine, and could easily take advantage of all the work Bradford had on offer due to the ease to reach there from Ireland. J. B. Hammond once commented on this, saying of the distance from Ireland to Yorkshire, &quot;It was easier to reach Yorkshire from Ireland than from Norfolk or Dorset... Labourers who were sent to Lancashire were taken to London, put on a boat of Pickfords...carried to Manchester in four or five days at a cost of fourteen shillings. But an Irishman could cross to Liverpool in fourteen hours for two shillings and sixpence&quot;. In 1851, records showed that Bradford had the highest proportion of Irish-born people in Yorkshire at the time. In Donald M. MacRaid&#x27;s book &quot;Irish Migration in Modern Britain&quot;, he comments on research showing that a large number of Bradford&#x27;s Irish originally came from County Mayo, County Sligo, County Dublin, and County Laois, with records also suggesting that there was a common migration trail at the time from County Roscommon to Bradford. Many of the Irish from Mayo and Sligo originated from a rural background, and at first struggled to adapt to urban life in Bradford. To this day, many residents of Bradford and the surrounding area are of Irish descent.

There was an Irish Diaspora Research Unit at the University of Bradford in the early 21st Century under Dr. Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan, but the Unit did not continue after he moved to New York University.

====Braintree, Essex====
In the 1950s many thousands of Irish migrated to Braintree in Essex to meet the demands of the labour shortage primarily in the Courtauld&#x27;s textile mills, both in Braintree and nearby Halstead. They also helped meet the need for labour both in Critall&#x27;s main Braintree factory.

====Coventry====
Coventry had a large influx of Irish from around the middle of the 20th century, when the city&#x27;s motor industry was booming. To this day, Coventry remains one of the cities in the UK with a higher Irish population, and retains strong Irish links. The city council put the town&#x27;s Irish population at 2.3% in 2009, higher than the UK national average of 1%, and additionally the Coventry Irish Society estimated that around 10% of the city&#x27;s population are of Irish descent.

====Gateshead====
During the 19th century, many of the towns in County Durham (the county Gateshead historically belongs to), which before that point had mostly been a rural county, began to take advantage of emerging new technology and discovered resources in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. This not only changed the face of the county, urbanizing much of it, but also led to expansion on a massive scale. People from all over the United Kingdom, ranging from the south of England to Ireland, moved to the area to take advantage of the large amount of work that these industries brought in roles such as coal mining and shipbuilding. As in many other instances around this time, it was the Great Famine which caused many from Ireland in particular to be drawn to jobs in the County Durham area, and make the move. A further advantage was that the county was quite straightforward to reach from Ireland, due to easy access by rail to there from the western port of Whitehaven, itself easily accessible by ferry from Ireland itself (in particular, Ulster). Gateshead in particular was one of the towns that changed most significantly due to the events of Industrial Revolution, but moreover took in one of the largest numbers of Irish of all the County Durham towns. In 1871, the town was recorded as having the densest number of Irish-born in County Durham, at 6.7%, and a year later it was recorded that 1 in 4 people in the town were Irish. The town also went through a huge population increase, rising by approximately 100,000 people over the course of the 19th century which the Irish undeniably contributed to. To this day, many people in the town are of Irish descent.

====Halifax====
Similarly to Bradford, Halifax was a desirable location for Irish escaping the Great Famine due to ease of access to reach, and the fact that its growth into an industrial boomtown over the 19th century coincided with the time of the famine. Many of the jobs on offer in Halifax were in newly opened cotton spinning mills, opened as a result of taking advantage of technological innovation in the then emerging textile industry. There were said to be as many as 24 mills in the town by 1850. The Irish contributed to its population growth from around 9,000 in 1800, to 25,000 by the middle of the century. In 1872, records showed that the Irish numbered &quot;from a sixth to an eighth of the population&quot; in Halifax, with it also being noted that &quot;the political strength of the Irish people in Halifax is considerable&quot;. Irish heritage still lives on in Halifax through the likes of the town&#x27;s football team, &quot;Halifax Irish F.C.&quot;

====Heywood====
As Heywood developed into a mill town during the Industrial Revolution, this brought a large number of new residents to the town, including many Irish escaping the Great Famine. Additionally, many Irish migrants took up jobs in the area working as navvies on the local railway, a fact that still lives on in the town&#x27;s legacy as some say that these navvies may have been the influence behind Heywood&#x27;s nickname, Monkey Town.

====Jarrow====
Also situated in County Durham, the story behind why many Irish moved to Jarrow is similar to that of Gateshead. Shipbuilding, in particular, drew many of them to Jarrow. The town to this day is still sometimes nicknamed Little Ireland, and has a large Catholic community, as a result of the sheer number of Irish who moved there.

====Keighley====
During the Industrial Revolution, Keighley flourished in the textile and weaving industries, which encouraged many Irish fleeing the Great Famine and looking for work to move there. This resulted in a significant Irish community, and to this day the town still has a large number of inhabitants of Irish descent. The Irish redefined aspects of Keighley as a town significantly. It was once commented that the (then fairly new) Irish community in Keighley &quot;contributed more to the Home-Rule than [in] either of the populous towns of Glasgow or Liverpool&quot;. The influence of the Irish also led to there being a large Catholic community in Keighley, which has lived on in both Catholic churches and schools that exist in the town today.

====Leeds====

There is an Irish community in Leeds, although it is generally smaller than in other large cities in Britain. The Leeds Irish Centre is on York Road on the east side of the city. The nearby area of East End Park is the area most associated with Leeds&#x27;s Irish community. In the years after the Famine, 3.3% of Leeds&#x27;s population was Irish-born. There was a particular concentration of migrants from the Irish county of Mayo. A book on the subject of migration from Ireland to Leeds in the 20th century was published in 2010: &quot;Taking The Boat: The Irish in Leeds, 1931-81.&quot;

====Liverpool====
Liverpool is widely known for having the strongest Irish heritage of any UK city - perhaps alongside Glasgow. This originates from the city&#x27;s port being close to Ireland, which made it easy to reach for all those escaping the Great Famine between 1845 and 1849. More than 20% of Liverpool&#x27;s population was Irish by 1851. Up to 2 million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within 10 years during this time, though many subsequently departed for the United States.

It is also twinned with Dublin. All four of Liverpool&#x27;s most famous natives, the Beatles, had some Irish ancestry: John Lennon&#x27;s great-grandparents on his father&#x27;s side were Irish immigrants from County Down, Paul McCartney had an Irish grandfather and great-grandfather, Ringo Starr had an Irish great-grandmother, and George Harrison had Irish blood through his mother.

Liverpool&#x27;s Irish heritage is further highlighted by it being the only English city to have a significant Orange Order membership, as well as having a large Irish Catholic majority and being the most Catholic city in the UK. It remains the only UK city to elect—and continuously re-elect—an Irish nationalist politician (T. P. O&#x27;Connor) and hosts one of the UK&#x27;s largest St Patrick&#x27;s Day parades. The city has been at odds with right-wing politicians since the 1970s, with a city council that was previously dominated by the right-wing Conservative Party becoming more left-wing, a relationship that was exacerbated further during the days of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose Conservative government planned to starve the area of resources. It has also been regarded as a notably European city, and often identifies more with Ireland and the European Union than the UK; this intensified in the 1980s during the UK media&#x27;s mishandling of the Hillsborough disaster, which saw lies being spread about dead Liverpudlians by tabloids such as &quot;The Sun&quot;, and it is not uncommon to hear a Liverpudlian refer to themselves as &quot;Scouse, not English&quot;. Pro-EU sentiment increased again in 2008, when the EU designated Liverpool as a &quot;Capital of Culture&quot; and helped it to regenerate by pouring over €1 billion into the economy while the Conservative UK government continued to cut its funding. The Irish have also come to be a staple of Liverpool&#x27;s surrounding areas; places such as Birkenhead, Bootle, Crosby, Halewood, Huyton, Kirkby, Litherland, Runcorn, St Helens and Wallasey have many ethnically Irish residents and have also inherited the Liverpool accent.

Between Liverpool FC and Everton FC, the city&#x27;s two biggest football teams, Everton FC is often cited as the more Irish of the two; some Liverpool FC fans have rejected this view.

====London Irish====
The term &quot;London Irish&quot; relates to people born in London of Irish descent. London has Great Britain&#x27;s biggest Irish population and there was a particularly big community in the (affectionately known) &quot;County Kilburn&quot; area of northwest London. With urban gentrification and higher housing costs, many of London&#x27;s working-class Irish-Catholic community have moved further out from Kilburn to Cricklewood.

Another large Irish community was in the Archway area, where many Irish navvies came to work in building railways and roads from the 1830s onwards. The community grew larger throughout the Famine years and then again after the Second World War when the Whittington Hospital in Archway recruited nurses from Ireland. This area became associated with Irish political activism with the election of Michael O&#x27;Halloran as MP for Islington North in 1969. O&#x27;Halloran referred to his supporters as &quot;the Irish mafia&quot;. In 2017, a new public space outside Archway underground station was named Navigator Square after the Irish navvies.

The Camden Town area of London, as well as Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, were also known for their large Irish communities. The Irish Cultural Centre is located in Hammersmith, West London. Greenford in the London Borough of Ealing is home to a large Irish community and contains Tir Chonaill Park, home to the Tír Chonaill Gaels Gaelic Football club.

====Manchester====
Manchester has strong and long established Irish connections. The earliest large influx of migrants arrived sometime around 1798 according to Peter Ewart, a Manchester cotton manufacturer. It has been estimated that around 35% of Manchester&#x27;s current population has Irish ancestry, although no reliable data exists to evidence this. In November 2012 whilst addressing an audience at the University of Manchester, Michael D. Higgins suggested &quot;the Irish connection in Manchester is no less evident than in Liverpool. And where Liverpool was a gateway for so many Irish people, Manchester tended to be for many the end of the journey, a home&quot;.

When Manchester&#x27;s population grew in the early 1800s due to it becoming the World&#x27;s first industrial city the Irish born in Manchester were said to represent over 15% of the population. The Irish were said to have lived in terrible conditions and were described by Friedrich Engels in his 1845 book &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;. Areas concentrated with high levels of Irish were known as Little Ireland around Oxford Road and later Ancoats and Hulme. Manchester was a breeding ground for Irish Republicanism, supporters known as Fenians, and when three Irish men were hanged accused of murder they became figureheads for Irish nationalism in Britain, Ireland and America and were known as the Manchester Martyrs. The reports of these terrible conditions sparked pioneering social changes in Manchester in the 1840s with the city often at the forefront of social reform in Britain.

Manchester was targeted by the IRA in the 1996 Manchester bombing in what was described as the biggest bomb on British soil since World War II. Manchester was targeted in part because security in London was so rigid due to parades in London for the Queen&#x27;s Trooping of the Colour. However, it was telling that the terrorists warned of the exact location beforehand to save human lives in a city with a rich history of Irish migration, balancing a fine line of shocking Britain and alienating supporters back home. On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it &quot;sincerely regretted&quot; causing injury to civilians. This stood in sharp contrast to their earlier 1993 bombing of nearby Warrington which killed two English children aged 3 and 12, which the IRA blamed on &quot;the British authorities&quot; for not being able to respond to its imprecise warning that did not even specify Warrington as the target.

The city&#x27;s residents of Irish heritage have been influential in the music industry. All four members of the Smiths had Irish roots, as do the Gallagher brothers of the band Oasis. Gary Mounfield (Mani), bass player of the Stone Roses had an Irish mother. Manchester holds an annual Irish Festival each March, including one of the UK&#x27;s largest St Patrick&#x27;s Day parades. Cheetham is home to the Irish World Heritage Centre.

Due to its connections with the local Irish Catholic population, Manchester United was almost named Manchester Celtic in 1902 and is the most supported football club in Ireland.

====Middlesbrough====
Middlesbrough during the latter half of the 19th century had the second highest percentage of Irish born migrants in England after Liverpool. In terms of the overall population, 15.6% of Middlesbrough&#x27;s inhabitants were Irish born in 1861 and 1 in 5 adults (9.2%) were Irish born in the 1871 census. During the late 19th century, Middlesbrough became a world leader in the Steel and Iron industry and with the rapid growth of the town, the expanse of newly opened blast furnaces attracted many workers and their families to the Middlesbrough area. Unlike many other towns in England at the time, Middlesbrough showed no signs of sectarianism or segregation within the various communities that lived alongside each other, there were no &quot;Irish quarters&quot; and the many Irish that settled in Middlesbrough integrated into their adopted home. This was most likely as a result of the town&#x27;s infancy, it was essentially a migrant town. Although the number of Irish born currently residing in Middlesbrough may not be as substantial as it once was, Middlesbrough retains a strong Irish connection and heritage through the ancestry of many residents.

====Sunderland====
Sunderland was another place in County Durham that many Irish escaping the famine saw as desirable. Once dubbed &quot;the largest shipbuilding town in the world&quot;, the city largely expanded into what it is today as a result of the number of people this work, and the demand for manual labour in other local jobs such as coal mining and chemical works, encouraged to move there. The Irish were one of the most significant groups who took advantage of the demand for labour and moved there, and consequently many people in Sunderland today have Irish heritage.

Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s father was a labourer in Sunderland for many years, which is why Peter O&#x27;Toole supported Sunderland A.F.C.

The city also celebrates St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

====Whitehaven====
Due to its port and close proximity to Ireland, similarly to Liverpool, Whitehaven was an easy way of accessing England for the Irish, especially when escaping the Great Famine of the 19th century. Thousands passed through the town to move on to work for themselves elsewhere in England, such as the aforementioned County Durham, however many also stayed in the area and many people in the town still have Irish heritage today.

====Widnes====
Widnes became a boom town during the Industrial Revolution, having a successful chemical industry brought on by a factory opened in the town in 1847, which led to many Irish workers (among others from Wales, Poland and Lithuania) moving there for work. Further making Widnes advantageous for the Irish to move to was its close proximity to Liverpool. Since then, a large number of overspill from the neighbouring city of Liverpool have brought many more people of Irish descent to Widnes too, particularly in areas at the west end of the town such as Ditton and Hough Green, where overspill are still moved.

====Wigan====
Wigan, being almost equal distance from Liverpool and Manchester received high immigration rates of Irish people in the 1800s. The Wigan districts population doubled from 60,000 in 1841 to 120,000 in 1871 with the immigration of Irish to the town the biggest factor. The Irish mainly settled in the central areas of the town such as Scholes and Ince with the area around Belle Green Lane referred to as Irishtown. St Patrick&#x27;s church in Scholes was built in 1847 on the back of huge swathes of Irish immigration. 

The local amateur rugby league club Wigan St Patricks has the Irish shamrock on the club badge with green and black being the club colours. 

The Wigan accent has even been affected by the great number of Irish coming to the town. The local word &quot;moidered&quot;, known elsewhere as &quot;mithered&quot;, is said to have derived from pronouncing the word &quot;mithered&quot; in an Irish accent.

====Wolverhampton====
Wolverhampton prospered during the Industrial Revolution, particularly having successful iron and locomotive industries, which attracted many Irish escaping the Great Famine. As well as this, Wolverhampton had a longstanding Roman Catholic community from as early as the 18th century, leading to the city sometimes being nicknamed &quot;Little Rome&quot;, which began to attract Irish to the city from an early stage.

===Irish in Scotland===
There are long standing migration links between Scotland and the Province of Ulster, especially between County Donegal, County Antrim and County Down with the west coast of Scotland. Considering the Dal Riada kingdoms and the gaelicisation of Scotland in the early Middle Ages, it is difficult to determine how many Scots have genetic ancestry from Ireland historically or how many were Picts who adopted Irish lifestyles, although the general consensus is that both happened as Pictish culture vanished by the 11th century. In 2001, around 55,000 people in Scotland (1.1 per cent of the Scottish population) had been born in Ireland, while people of Irish (either Protestant or Catholic) ancestry make up 20% of the Scottish population. Scotland has a greater number of persons born in Northern Ireland and County Donegal (0.66 per cent) than people who were born in the rest of Ireland (0.43%). Despite having lower than average numbers of Irish people resident, the Lanarkshire town of Coatbridge is more than 50% Catholic. The town is populated by the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth generation children of Irish immigrants, especially immigrants from County Donegal. In 2006 more than 28% of adults in Coatbridge had surnames with Irish origins. Coatbridge holds the largest St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Festival in Scotland.

Famous Scots of Irish-Catholic ancestry include actors Sean Connery, Brian Cox and Gerard Butler; comedians Billy Connolly and Frankie Boyle; singers Susan Boyle, Gerry Rafferty, Fran Healy and David Byrne; historians Tom Devine and Michael Lynch; footballers like Jimmy McGrory and Ray Houghton; politicians like James Connolly (the trade unionist and Easter Rising leader), Jim Murphy (former British Shadow Defence Secretary), and socialist political figure Tommy Sheridan; television presenter Lorraine Kelly; businessmen like Thomas Lipton; and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, A. J. Cronin, John Byrne and Andrew O&#x27;Hagan.

Support for particular football teams often reflects Catholic or Protestant heritage. Celtic are overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, supported by people from a Catholic background. Hibernian and Dundee United were formed as clubs representing Irish Catholics, however there is little vestige of these founding values today. Teams such as Dundee (though founded before Dundee United on entirely secular grounds), Heart of Midlothian and Lanarkshire teams such as Motherwell and Airdrie are contentiously perceived by some as Protestant clubs. Rangers are seen as having retained a Protestant identity, despite signing a number of Catholic players since the 1980s.

Today a very small minority of the Irish Catholic community in Scotland take part in Irish republican marches (mainly in Strathclyde), though these marches do not have exclusively Catholics in attendance, with many Protestants and others of various faiths or none involved, and the Orange Order has a large membership in Scotland, predominantly in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. As well as Scotland&#x27;s own parades, many Scottish bands parade in Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and County Donegal) on or around 12 July.

===Irish in Wales===
Starting in the 4th century AD, Irish raiders settled Wales extensively, their impact being so great that many Irish words were introduced into the Welsh language. Many Irish emigrants came to Wales as a result of the famine of 1845–52. They were often very poor, and seen as carrying &quot;famine fever&quot; (typhus), but over time they acquired a notable presence—in the thousands, particularly in the Welsh coal mining towns in and around Swansea and Newport.

One of the most famous Welsh nationals of Irish-Catholic ancestry is screen actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.

The Irish language is taught at all levels in the Department of Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth University in West Wales, and scholarships offered to students to do intensive summer language courses in Ireland 

==Cultural impact==
===Catholic Church===
The large-scale migration of Irish people to Britain in the 19th century contributed to the reemergence of the Catholic Church in England, which ultimately accelerated tolerance for freedom of religion in the United Kingdom. Observed by the Catholic Church, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is widely celebrated throughout Great Britain, owing to many British people&#x27;s ancestral links with Ireland as well as the general popularity of the event. Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester have particularly large parades.

===Irish language===
The Irish language has a long history in Britain. Gaels came to Britain between the 4th to 5th centuries and established Irish speaking communities in the west coast of Scotland that remain to this day. The waves of immigrants from Ireland that settled in British communities in the 19th century included speakers of Irish but English became the norm. However, there are regular gatherings of Irish speakers in London, Glasgow and Manchester and lessons available all over Britain including Glasgow, Milton Keynes, Manchester, Brighton, Lewisham, Hammersmith, Camden, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle and Cardiff. While several British universities offer a one-term-long introduction to the Irish language, the Department of Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth University in west Wales is the only university to teach the modern Irish language at all levels. Modules in Old, Middle and Early-Modern Irish are also offered, and students can receive scholarships to do intensive summer courses in Ireland.

====Access to services in the language====
The lack of provision for legal and citizenship services in the Irish language, including for the Life in the United Kingdom test, has been met with criticism from the &quot;Committee of Experts&quot; of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, of which the UK has ratified for the Cornish language, the Irish language, Manx Gaelic, the Scots &amp; Ulster Scots dialects, Scottish Gaelic and the Welsh language. In a 2014 report detailing the application of the charter in the UK, the Committee were given no justification for the inequality in the treatment of Irish speakers in contrast to that of English, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh speakers, and said that efforts to rectify the inequality were non-existent.

===Sport===
Sports teams with links to the Irish community exist in England, although this is not as marked as in Scotland.

===Football===
In football, Aston Villa, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United have a tradition of representing the Irish communities in their area although unlike many clubs in Scotland they were not formed on the basis of representing the Irish community. For example, Arsenal has featured ethnically Irish players such as Liam Brady, Terry Neill, Pat Rice, Niall Quinn, David O&#x27;Leary and Graham Barrett. Aston Villa has featured many Irish players such as Steve Staunton, Paul McGrath, Richard Dunne and former managers David O&#x27;Leary and Martin O&#x27;Neill. Aston Villa has a large Irish following in the West Midlands which has the highest proportion of Irish people in England. Both Everton and Liverpool have roots in a Methodist church but Everton F.C. was often described as Liverpool&#x27;s Irish Catholic team, probably because Everton had a number of Irish internationals in the 1950s. Liverpool F.C. was formed by a prominent Orangeman but this fact did not deter Liverpool people from a Catholic background supporting the team. Everton has notably produced Wayne Rooney who is of Irish descent and have recently featured promising Irish international Séamus Coleman; as were prominent Liverpool players who were Everton fans in their youth such as Jamie Carragher and Steve McManaman. Recently Jonjo Shelvey has become the latest in a line of Liverpool players with Irish heritage, going back to the days of Mark Lawrenson, Ronnie Whelan and Ray Houghton. Neither Liverpool nor Everton have a sectarian affiliation and many families are split in support of the clubs.

Under the management of Sir Matt Busby, Manchester United also emerged as a club with a considerable Irish following both in Great Britain and in Ireland itself, as well as having notable Irish stars like George Best, Norman Whiteside, Mal Donaghy, Denis Irwin, Roy Keane, and recently John O&#x27;Shea.

====Rugby====
In rugby league, Dewsbury Celtic represented the large Irish community in Dewsbury, and St. Helens represent communities on Merseyside. Wigan St Patricks amateur rugby league club is borne out of the St Patricks Catholic Church in Scholes, Wigan, that was built in 1847 after huge swathes of Irish moved to the town.

The rugby union club London Irish represents the community in London.

====Gaelic Games====
The British GAA is responsible for Gaelic games in Britain. There are seven GAA counties within Britain and a number of hurling, football and camogie clubs operate within each county.

===Brexit===
Ever since the Brexit vote in 2016, over 400,000 British persons with ties to Ireland – mainly that of Irish diaspora – applied for an Irish passport as of 2021. This phenomenon further adds on to the growing demand for Irish identity, but is also attributed to rising popularity in European Union citizenship.

==Perceptions of Irish immigration==
===Effect on the British trade union movement===
In 1870, Karl Marx examined how the migration of Irish labour into the British labour market caused significant problems for the nascent English trade union movement since an over-supply of workers enabled employers to lower wages and threaten organised British workers with replacement by Irish migrants. Marx wrote in a letter that &quot;the ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life&quot;, in addition to noting that &quot;every industrial and commercial centre in England now possesses a working class divided into two hostile camps&quot;, consisting of the English and Irish working class.

===Criminality===
Perceptions of Irish immigration in Victorian Britain led to negative stereotypes. Settling in large numbers, at a time of unprecedented economic development, Irish people, and especially those living in poverty, were seen as innately criminal by elements of British society. It was even a widespread belief that Irish migrants formed the core of what were described as the &quot;dangerous classes&quot;, and represented a threat to law and order. The Vagrancy Act 1824 was, in part, a reaction to significant levels of perceived vagrancy from Irish people &quot;searching for generous local welfare in England&quot;.

===Disease and poverty===
The results of Irish migration during the 19th century were also perceived as bringing disease and poverty into urban centres, in particular cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.

==Social and health issues==
===Health===
A 2009 study published in &quot;Ethnicity &amp; Health&quot; demonstrated that the grouping self-reported higher rates of poor general health than the White British populace. This was found to be particularly the case in Northern Ireland, for those who had designated themselves as White, and with an &quot;Irish&quot; national identity. In 2020, a UCL study based in NHS England data, showed that the White Irish group was around 50 per cent less at risk of death from COVID-19 than other black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. This was significantly lower than the White British group, which were 12 per cent lower than the average risk for BAME communities.

===Identity===
In 2015 research, University of Southampton fellow Dr Rosalind Willis explored the social fragility of the White Irish ethnicity, particularly in England where distinctions between White British and White Irish are, at times, openly denied.

In July 2019, the East Ham constituency Labour branch was criticised for its election of a white Irish woman as the women’s officer for its Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) forum. The woman in question self-identified as being an ethnic minority and no objections within the branch were raised against her election. Branch secretary, Syed Taqi Shah commented that &quot;if somebody self-declares [as BAME], and the Labour Party allows them to do so, they should be respected.&quot;

===Police discrimination===
In a 1995 study, sociologist Jock Young found that of 1000 randomly selected residents of Finsbury Park when were asked if they had been stopped by the police over the past year, the White Irish population was disproportionately large with 14.3%, in contrast to 12.8% of Black Caribbean and 5.8% of White British people. The researchers found the Police tactic of &quot;lurking and larking&quot;, whereby constables would wait outside Irish pubs and clubs to make arrests to be to blame for the high statistics, which was labelled a form of &quot;institutional racism&quot;.

==Census==
===2001 Census===
The 2001 UK census was the first which allowed British citizens to identify an Irish ethnicity. In all previous British censuses, figures for the Irish community were based on Irish birthplace. The percentage claiming White Irish descent in England and Wales was 1.2 per cent, with the highest concentration found in the London Borough of Brent, where they made up 6.9 per cent of the population, while the figure for Scotland was 0.98 per cent. The Irish have been the largest source of immigrants to Britain for over 200 years and as many as six million people in the UK are estimated to have at least one Irish grandparent.

===2011 census===
As of 2011, the highest concentration was in the London Borough of Brent where they made up 4.0 per cent of the population. This was followed by the Inner London boroughs of Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham and Camden, and the Outer London boroughs of Ealing and Harrow (all above 3.0 per cent). The highest concentration outside London was the city of Manchester, at 2.4 per cent.

===2021 census===
The 2021 census (2022 in Ireland and Scotland) was the first time since detailed records have been available that the Irish-born population comprised less than 1% of the population of Great Britain, and the first time since 1841 that it was less than 10% of the population of Ireland.

====Profile of Irish in England in 2021====
The age profile of the Irish-born is shown below. The population is aging, with 63% aged over 50 (compared to 39% among those born in England). 50.4% of those born in the Republic of Ireland arrived before 1981. Since those born in Northern Ireland are counted as UK citizens, information on when they moved is not available.

In contrast to the stereotype of the Irish navvy or building worker, almost two thirds of Irish people under 50 in England are now full time students (ages 16-24) or working in professional, administrative, and management positions. This is in comparison to 49% of 16-24 year olds in full time education, and 43% of the population in professional, administrative and management positions in the English-born.

Similarly, a significantly higher percentage of Irish-born people hold a degree or equivalent, compared to England overall. Nearly 75% of 25-34 year olds and 66% of 35–44 year olds hold a degree, compared to 43–45% of English people. It is higher across all age groups under 75.

There are few significant differences between those born in Northern Ireland and those born in the Republic, among the Irish-born in England under 50. However those born in Northern Ireland and over 50 are more likely to have a degree and to be in a professional occupation.

====Profile of Irish in Scotland in 2022====
The 2022 Scottish census reports 59,343 residents (1.1% of the Scottish population) who were born in Ireland, of which 37,260 (2% of the population of Northern Ireland) were born in Northern Ireland and 22,083 born in the Republic of Ireland (0.4% of its population). 

The age profile of the Irish-born in Scotland from the 2022 Census is shown below. Compared to the population in England, the Irish-born living in Scotland are much younger, with fewer than half over 50 and a median age in the mid-40s.

Similar to the Irish in England, the majority are either full time students (72% of 16-24 year olds) or in managerial, administrative and professional occupations (60% of those between 25 and 50). Irish-born are twice as likely to be in upper managerial, administrative and professional occupations as those born in Scotland.

Similarly, a significantly higher percentage of Irish-born people hold a degree or equivalent, compared to Scotland overall. More than 75% of 25-34 year olds and nearly 70% of 35–49 year olds hold a degree. Irish-born are twice as likely to have a degree than those born in Scotland

<text>RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; (A81) was a small tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom.

RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; was built by Furness Shipbuilding Company of Stockton-on-Tees. She was launched as the civilian &quot;London Loyalty&quot; for London &amp; Overseas Freighters in 1953 and completed on 8 January 1954. She was a sister ship of built by the same shipyard for LOF the following year.

She was bareboat chartered for the RFA in 1959 and renamed RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot;. She was returned to her owners in 1972, who transferred her to their Mayfair Tankers subsidiary and registered her in Liberia as the &quot;Mayfair Loyalty&quot;.

On 9 September 1974 she was laid up at La Spezia, Italy. On 27 February 1976 she was sold for scrap, and demolition began in La Spezia in July of that year.

<text>RFA &quot;Orangeleaf&quot; was a Leaf-class fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom, and which served with the fleet for over 30 years, tasked with providing fuel, food, fresh water, ammunition and other supplies to Royal Navy and allied naval vessels around the world.

She was used by the RFA in the Falklands War in 1982, but she was then known as MV &quot;Balder London&quot;. From January 2003 to April 2003 &quot;Orangeleaf&quot; was deployed for Operation Telic, the codename for the United Kingdom&#x27;s military operations in Iraq. She had three Leaf-class sisters , and and all four were originally designed as commercial tankers and underwent major conversions to bring them up to RFA standards and equip them for naval support.

She was the third Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel to bear the name.

== Construction ==
&quot;Orangeleaf&quot; was one of four ships ordered from Cammell Laird at Birkenhead by Hudson Steamship Co, Brighton, and was laid down in 1973 as &quot;Hudson Progress&quot;. When the ordering company ran into financial difficulties the builders completed three of the ships but they were then laid up and later offered for charter or for purchase. On 12 February 1975 &quot;Hudson Progress&quot; was launched and the Lady Sponsor was Mrs J Appleby, wife of John Appleby, managing director of the Hudson Steamship Co. She later ran builder’s trials in July 1975, but then on completion she was laid up at Birkenhead.

In June 1979 &quot;Hudson Progress&quot; was purchased by Lloyds Industrial Leasing, London and sailed from the Mersey to the Clyde for trials. In July she was leased to Parley Augustsson, Oslo and renamed &quot;Balder London&quot;.

== Operational history ==
As MV &quot;Balder London&quot;, before joining the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, she saw action in 1982, carrying aviation fuel to the Falkland Islands from Ascension Island. At the end of the conflict, she entered the bay of San Carlos Water, East Falkland.

She was bareboat chartered on 2 May 1984 by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and was renamed &quot;Orangeleaf&quot;. Shortly afterwards she arrived in Falmouth, Cornwall for a partial conversion. In September 1985 &quot;Orangeleaf&quot; arrived on the River Tyne for full conversion which was completed and entered operational service on 2 May 1986.

On 13 June 1988 she sailed from HMNB Portsmouth as part of Task Group 318.1, the &#x27;Outback 88&#x27; Deployment led by the , along with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary’s and &quot;Ol-class&quot; &quot;fast fleet tanker&quot; .

&quot;Orangeleaf&quot; saw action in the Gulf War. On 9 August 1990 she was deployed in support of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 42 destroyer , following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and whilst on Armilla Patrol in the Gulf, when Operation Granby – the Gulf War – was approved.

Between 14 and 28 August 1992 she was deployed to support a humanitarian relief effort in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, in the West Indies, alongside the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 42 destroyer and the Type 22 frigate .

During early-to-mid-2004, the ship took part in a deployment with a French carrier battle group, centred on the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, to the Indian Ocean. She also appeared in the International Fleet Review 2005.

On 23 October 2009, she was moved from Birkenhead dry-docks into the River Mersey and so to the Cammell Laird shipyard to continue a major refit.

In 2011, she conducted a light jackstay transfer with .

== Decommissioning and fate ==
&quot;Orangeleaf&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 2015.

In February 2016, she was towed to Aliağa, Turkey to be broken up for scrap.

<text>RFA &quot;Diligence&quot; was a forward repair ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Launched in 1981 as a support ship for North Sea oil rigs, she was chartered by the British government to support naval activities during the 1982 Falklands War and was later bought outright as a fleet maintenance vessel. She gave assistance to the damaged and in the 1991 Gulf War, and to Sri Lanka after the 2005 tsunami. She typically had deployments of 5-8 years in support of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class submarine on duty east of Suez, with a secondary role as a mothership for British and US minesweepers in the Persian Gulf. Until 2016 Diligence was set to go out of service in 2020. However in August 2016, the UK Ministry of Defence placed an advert for the sale of RFA Diligence. As of 2016 the option for the delivery of future operational maintenance and repair capability for the RFA remained under consideration. However, the 2021 British defence white paper made no specific mention of the need for this capability. In April 2024 she arrived in Turkey for recycling.

==Facilities==
&quot;Diligence&quot; was designed to provide forward repair and maintenance facilities to ships and submarines operating away from their home ports, so in addition to a variety of workshops she could also provide overside electrical supplies, fuel, water and sullage reception. &quot;Diligence&quot; provided a large workshop facility for Royal Navy vessels, she was equipped with specialist machinery such as arc welding equipment, lathes, pillar drills, grinders, band saws and a large store of spares.

&quot;Diligence&quot; was the Royal Navy&#x27;s primary battle damage repair unit, and was on short notice to react to developing situations worldwide. One of the key features of the ship&#x27;s design was the dynamic positioning system which could keep the vessel static in poor conditions, using the ship&#x27;s range of thrusters and the variable-pitch propeller.

The ship had a helicopter deck on the roof of her bridge that was large enough to support a CH-47 Chinook. The hull was built to the highest ice class specification, which allowed her to navigate polar regions without the assistance of an icebreaker.

==Launch and the Falklands War==
&quot;Diligence&quot; was built by Öresundsvarvet in Landskrona, Sweden and launched in 1981 as a civilian oil rig support ship. She first served the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) immediately after the Falklands War as a civilian owned ship taken up from the trade (&quot;STUFT&quot;). As MV &quot;Stena Inspector&quot;, the ship repaired many British vessels. &quot;Stena Inspector&quot; was purchased by the Government in 1983 for £25 million from Stena Offshore UK and renamed &quot;Diligence&quot;. She was sailed to the Clyde Dock Engineering facility, where she was converted and military features added, including a large workshop for hull and machinery repairs, supply facilities, accommodation, armaments and magazines and communications fits.
Her Sister Ship, &quot;Stena Seaspread &quot; had previously been a STUFT ship during the Falklands War.

==Later history==
&quot;Diligence&quot; provided damage repair work many times during her lifetime. At the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the Straits of Hormuz were mined, and &quot;Diligence&quot; supported the multinational minesweeping operation to clear that vital chokepoint. &quot;Diligence&quot; also helped to repair after collision damage. The ship returned to the Persian Gulf in 1990 to support operations during the Gulf War by repairing, among others, two American ships damaged by mines.

In 1995, according to British reports, &quot;Diligence&quot; was confronted and illuminated by the radar of the Argentine corvette , which was harassing shipping near the Falklands.
During Operation Ocean Wave 97, &quot;Diligence&quot; deployed to the Far East as a submarine support ship. The following year, the ship supported 3rd Mine Counter-Measures Squadron in the Persian Gulf. Following just two weeks in the UK, &quot;Diligence&quot; departed for the south Atlantic, returning to Faslane in December 1998. Early 1999 saw the ship again deployed to the Falklands region.

2001 saw a large exercise in Oman, and &quot;Diligence&quot; supported the four MCMVs involved. The ship&#x27;s next wartime assignment came with the large taskforce deployed against Iraq in 2003. Returning to familiar territory, &quot;Diligence&quot; supported the largest British fleet deployed since the Falklands War.

When the ship returned to UK in November 2006 she had the longest deployment of an RFA in recent times. From her departure from Portsmouth it was 5 and half years before she returned home to Portsmouth. In that time she has visited 25 different countries whilst steaming some , through the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, across the Indian Ocean to India, Sri Lanka and Singapore, the South China Sea to the Philippines and from South Africa across the Atlantic to the Falklands and South America. Many of these Oceans and countries visited 2 or 3 times.

All this work took its toll on the 25-year-old ship, and the ship was given a £16 million overhaul during 2007 at Northwestern Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders in Birkenhead. Her accommodation areas, galley and engine room were all upgraded, with the intention of extending the ship&#x27;s service life until the middle of the next decade. The overhaul was completed in December 2007.

A £17.6m refit was carried out from June 2012 to February 2013 ahead of a deployment to the Mediterranean and Gulf region in support of the COUGAR 13 task group. An £11m refit followed from September 2014 to February 2015, after which she was laid up at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead.

===Disposal===
In June 2016 the Royal Navy decided to retire the ship immediately instead of in 2020 as had previously been planned as a cost-saving measure. A Royal Navy spokesman told IHS Jane&#x27;s that &quot;Diligence&quot; was considered to be &quot;an aged singleton ship with increasing obsolescence issues&quot;, and that it was no longer cost-effective to maintain her in service. As of 2016, no replacement for the ship had been identified and the 2021 British defence white paper made no mention of the need for any such capability.

In March 2017, &quot;Diligence&quot; was towed from Birkenhead to Portsmouth where she awaited a potential buyer. In April 2023, it was revealed that the ship was to be scrapped after no suitable buyers materialised, and in March 2024 she departed the UK for the final time, under tow to a scrapyard in Turkey.

<text>RFA &quot;Argus&quot; is a ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary operated by the Ministry of Defence under the Blue Ensign. Italian-built, &quot;Argus&quot; was formerly the container ship &quot;Contender Bezant&quot;. The ship was requisitioned in 1982 for service in the Falklands War and purchased outright in 1984 for a four-year conversion to an Aviation Training Ship, replacing RFA &quot;Engadine&quot;. In 1991, during the Gulf War, she was fitted with an extensive and fully functional hospital to assume the additional role of Primary Casualty Receiving Ship. In 2009, the PCRS role became the ship&#x27;s primary function. &quot;Argus&quot; is due to remain in service beyond 2030. In July 2022 it was reported that the future Littoral Strike Role would be assumed by &quot;Argus&quot; after a refit to convert her to this role. As of October 2023, &quot;Argus&quot; had started her deployment to serve as part of Littoral Response Group (South).

In her secondary role as a primary casualty receiving ship, given she is an armed vessel and not painted in the required white with red crosses, the Geneva Convention does not permit her to be being officially classified as a hospital ship. The ship&#x27;s capabilities make her ideally suited to the humanitarian aid role and she has undertaken several of these missions. The Royal Navy has occasionally described her as a &quot;support ship/helicopter carrier&quot;.

==Design and facilities==
The ship was built by Società Italiana Ernesto Breda at Marghera in Italy for Contender 2 Ltd (Sea Containers, Managers) of Hamilton, Bermuda, and was launched on 28 November 1980. In May 1982, the &quot;Contender Bezant&quot; was taken-up from trade by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and given a basic conversion at HMNB Devonport to allow her to operate helicopters and Harrier jump jets in the transport role for Operation Corporate, the British military deployment to the Falkland Islands. She arrived in the area shortly after the Argentine surrender and following a refit to her original configuration, was returned to her owners in November.

Following the conflict, the MoD investigated the replacement of the small helicopter support ship RFA &quot;Engadine&quot;, commissioning Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL) make a &quot;concept study&quot; resulting in the decision to convert a merchant ship to operate anti-submarine helicopters and with the ability to ferry Sea Harrier aircraft. In December 1983 the MoD invited British Shipbuilders of Birkenhead and Harland and Wolff in Belfast to tender on the building of a new Air Training Ship (ATS) or to purchase and convert an existing ship along the lines proposed by VSEL. By coincidence both tenders proposed converting the laid-up &quot;Contender Bezant&quot; and in March 1984, a fixed price contract was awarded to Harland and Wolff. Accordingly, she was purchased by the company for the estimated price of £18 million on 14 March 1984.
After a four-year conversion, the ship entered RFA service in 1988. Having been initially designed as a container ship, she would have been too stable when unloaded, making her motion at sea &quot;very stiff&quot; which resulted in a very short roll period which is not appropriate for operating helicopters. Therefore, her superstructure is deliberately heavily built (weighing some 800 tons), and she has 1,800 tons of concrete ballast carried in former hatch covers, which have been inverted to form tray-like structures.

Being a former container ship, &quot;Argus&quot; does not have a traditional aircraft carrier layout – the ship&#x27;s superstructure is located forward, with a long flight deck aft. The ship has a small secondary superstructure approximately two-thirds of the way down the flight deck, containing the ship&#x27;s exhaust funnel. This is used by small helicopters to simulate landing on the flight deck of a destroyer or frigate.

For the 1991 Gulf War &quot;Argus&quot; was fitted with a fully functional hospital, which has since been modified and extensively augmented with specialist equipment, providing 70 to 100 beds. The ship is equipped with an intensive-care unit, and can provide medical x-ray and CT-scan services. Casualties can be quickly transferred from the deck directly into the assessment area. Since 2009, the ship&#x27;s role as a Primary Casualty Receiving Ship has been her principal role, although she continues to be used for aviation training.

In 2007 the ship was refitted with upgraded hospital facilities (replacing the forward aircraft lift with a ramp for emergency exit for hospital trollies and patients as well as two 50-man passenger lifts that lead to a new structure erected on the flight deck), generators and aviation systems (the ship had been due to receive an upgrade to its night-vision capabilities enabling the use of WAH-64 Apache helicopters) to provide an operational life (at that time) until 2020.

&quot;Argus&quot; also has the ability to refuel ships at sea, as exemplified in April 2024 when she replenished in the Indian Ocean.

==Service history==
===1980s===
As the MV &quot;Contender Bezant&quot;, following conversion the ship left Devonport on 20 May 1982 and calling at Charleston, South Carolina &quot;en route&quot;, arrived at Port William, Falkland Islands on 19 June 1982. She returned to the United Kingdom in August.

===1990s===
&quot;Argus&quot; entered service with the RFA in 1988, replacing in the aviation training role. The ship deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 for service in the Gulf War (Operation Granby), and later provided humanitarian aid for Kurdish civilians in Operation Haven. &quot;Argus&quot; also saw service in the Adriatic in 1993 and 1999 supporting British operations in Bosnia and over Kosovo respectively. During this period, &quot;Argus&quot; operated in part as a LPH. Her unsuitability for this role was a major factor in the commissioning of . On 2 February 1998, three helicopters based on &quot;Argus&quot; rescued 12 members of the crew of MV &quot;Delfin Mediteraneo&quot; from their life rafts when the ship sank in the Atlantic. Normal flying had been abandoned, due to bad weather, but the rescue went ahead in waves, earning three Air Force Crosses and six Queen&#x27;s Commendations for Bravery in the Air for the aircrew.

===2000s===
During times of war RFA &quot;Argus&quot; could act as a floating hospital with two fully equipped wards and mortuary. The hospital was utilised in this way off the coast of Freetown in 2000–01, in support of British operations against the rebel West Side Boys.

A project to replace &quot;Argus&quot; called the Joint Casualty Treatment Ship (JCTS) was put on hold in December 2001 after passing initial approval. The Integrated Project Team (IPT) managing the project was subsequently disbanded in 2005. &quot;Argus&quot; was most recently stationed at her home port of Falmouth in Cornwall, England, though being an RFA ship means that she also uses the former naval dockyard on Portland in Dorset, England.

In 2003 &quot;Argus&quot; was deployed again to the Gulf as a Primary Casualty Reception Ship during Operation Telic. A 33-ship fleet supported a British amphibious assault of the Al-Faw Peninsula.

In 2008 she deployed to the Middle East to act as a platform for Sea King ASaC7 helicopters. On 13 July, the ships in the deployment seized 23 tonnes of narcotics in the Persian Gulf.

===2010s===
In June 2011, &quot;Argus&quot; was operating in the Middle East around Yemen. By August she had returned to Falmouth and was filmed for the film &quot;World War Z&quot;.

In mid-May 2012 the vessel, with embarked forces from the Royal Marines and Fleet Air Arm, including an embarked Super Lynx helicopter and the newly formed Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Team, set sail for North America to support potential humanitarian operations during the hurricane season. Their primary mission was to support the British Overseas Territories should they require assistance in the hurricane season as well as maintaining the constant Royal Navy presence within the wider region. Before commencing her disaster relief mission the ship engaged in multinational exercises and celebrations commemorating the War of 1812 with units from the US Navy as part of OpSail 2012.

In 2013 the ship was used for training with the AgustaWestland Wildcat, the successor to the Lynx.

In 2014 the ship participated in the annual Exercise Joint Warrior, practising Medical Evacuation and Treatment. On 8 October 2014, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond announced that the RFA &quot;Argus&quot; would travel to Sierra Leone to assist with the 2014 Ebola outbreak. On 30 October of the same year, the vessel docked in Sierra Leone, with three Merlin helicopters embarked. Their work of establishing shore-based medical facilities and transporting aid to outlying areas earned the ship an Admiralty Board Letter of Commendation and 167 Ebola Medals for Service in West Africa were awarded to crew members.

In mid-2017 &quot;Argus&quot; was host to four Wildcat helicopters from 825 Naval Air Squadron for initial training off the coast of Portugal which lasted for three weeks.

In June 2018, following a year-long refit, she embarked Merlin HC4 helicopters of 845 Naval Air Squadron and Wildcats of 847 NAS which practised amphibious landings in support of exercise Baltic Protector in the Baltic Sea.

===2020s===
In April 2020, the Royal Navy dispatched the &quot;Argus&quot; to the Caribbean region to support British Overseas Territories, if required, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in preparation for the upcoming hurricane season. This is contrary to some previous media reports in the tabloid press, which stated that she would be deployed to London to assist with the coronavirus outbreak in the UK.

&quot;Argus&quot; had been expected to retire from service in 2024. However, in 2022 the Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin indicated that she was likely to be life extended until beyond 2030. Her functions are projected eventually to be taken over by the new Multi Role Support Ships proposed for acquisition in the 2021 defence white paper.

In March 2023, as part of her conversion to the littoral strike role, &quot;Argus&quot; was fit with a single Phalanx 20 mm close-in-weapon-system as part of her armament and conducted training with Army Air Corps Apache helicopters. In the autumn of 2023, following intensive maintenance and upgrade for her new role, the ship was expected to deploy east of Suez as the principal unit of Littoral Response Group (South).

In October 2023, &quot;Argus&quot; began a long-term deployment to the Indian Ocean region in company with the dock landing ship . For her deployment as part of Littoral Response Group (South), she reportedly embarked three Merlin Mk4 helicopters. It was subsequently indicated by the Government that she was to remain, for a time, in the Eastern Mediterranean with &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; as part of a broader British regional presence given the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

In February 2024, &quot;Argus&quot; briefly operated under the authority of Naval Striking Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO) in the Eastern Mediterranean alongside the USS BATAAN Amphibious Readiness Group, consisting of USS &quot;Bataan&quot; (LHD-5), USS &quot;Carter Hall&quot; (LSD-50), USS &quot;Mesa Verde&quot; (LPD-19), and USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; (DDG-51) as part of a NATO transfer of authority (TOA) exercise.

In March 2024, maintenance of &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; was undertaken at the Larsen &amp; Toubro&#x27;s Kattupalli Shipyard in India. This was the first time that a Royal Navy ship had arrived in an Indian shipyard for maintenance. The ships, escorted by , had transited through the Red Sea to reach India. In April 2024, LRG(S) participated in Maritime Partnership Exercise with Indian Navy&#x27;s Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean. The exercise included stealth frigate . The tasks conducted in the exercise included tactical manoeuvres, boarding ops, surface engagement against simulated asymmetric threats, cross deck visits &amp; cross deck helo ops. In May 2024, &quot;Argus&quot; entered dry dock for additional maintenance, this time in Singapore. 

In July 2024, both &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; deployed to Australia for exercise &quot;Predators Run&quot; which included troops from 40 Commando Royal Marines, and also involved US and Australian forces. In September 2024, &quot;Argus&quot; began transit back to the U.K. visiting Cape Town enroute. She arrived in the UK in early October to begin refit which is anticipated to last until March 2025. It is planned that &quot;Argus&quot; will again deploy east of Suez in 2025 as part of the UK Carrier Strike Group.

<text>RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot; is a retired British &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot;-class dry stores ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

&quot;Fort Austin&quot; was laid down at Scott Lithgow in 1975, launched in 1978 and commissioned in 1979. These ships were designed to carry a wide range of dry stores to support fleet task forces; ammunition, food, explosives. They have extensive aviation facilities, with two flight decks, one to the stern and one spot on top of the hangar, up to four Sea Kings can be stored in the large hangar. These ships also have the capability to replenish ships at sea, via six RAS points.

==Operational history==

===Falklands War 1982===
When the Falklands War began, the ship was deployed in the western Mediterranean for the annual Spring Train exercise, and received orders to head south, taking part in the landings at San Carlos Water as a stores and ammunition ship. When the order to head south was given, several warships had the WE.177A nuclear weapon deployed aboard. Amongst these were the Type 22 frigates and and the aircraft carriers and . Some newspaper reports also named RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot;. The Ministry of Defence explored various options to transfer these nuclear weapons from the frigates to the safety of the deep magazines aboard &quot;Fort Austin&quot;, &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;. An MoD publication describes a complex series of manoeuvres to avoid the presence of these nuclear warheads in areas that would break the UK obligation to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, often referred to as the Latin-America Nuclear Free Zone. In no circumstances could ships carrying nuclear weapons enter territorial waters around the Falkland Islands. After the conflict ended, weapons were transferred at sea to the two RFAs &quot;Fort Austin&quot; and &quot;Resource&quot; for transport back to the UK.

===2000s===
In 2000, the ship supported the British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War.

Beginning in September 2007, the ship underwent a major refit and modernization at the A&amp;P Tyne shipyard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.

In July 2009, RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Portsmouth Naval Base. Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review of October 2010 it was decided to reactivate her at the expense of the larger RFA &quot;Fort George&quot;, which would be decommissioned.

===2010s===
On 27 May 2011 &quot;Fort Austin&quot; left Portsmouth under tow by the Belgian tug &quot;Union Wrestler&quot; and tug &quot;Svitzer Pembroke&quot; for a £40m refit at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. This refit was intended to keep her in service until 2021. Later that year it was announced that her service life would be extended until 2023; the Fort class will ultimately be replaced by the Fleet Solid Support element of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme.

She left Birkenhead on 5 September 2012, arriving three days later at DM Crombie in the Firth of Forth. She arrived back in Plymouth at the end of 2012 and spent early 2013 exercising in home waters.

&quot;Fort Austin&quot; formed part of the COUGAR 13 task group, providing stores, fuel, water, and ammunition Fort Austin is also participating in the 2014 IMCMEX.

In 2015, &quot;Fort Austin&quot; was again laid up, this time in Birkenhead. Despite concerns she would be decommissioned she entered Cammell Laird for refit in 2017 and it was confirmed her planned out of service date had been revised to 2024. During the course of the refit, on 15 August 2017, &quot;Fort Austin&quot; suffered a fire on the upper deck. Her 60 crew were evacuated. The damage was not considered to be serious.

===2020s===
In June 2020, &quot;Fort Austin&quot; was reported to be in extended readiness (reserve) with replenishment rigs not compatible with the s. The defence white paper of 2021 announced that &quot;Fort Austin&quot;, along with &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot;, was to be decommissioned, with successors from the Fleet Solid Support plan set to replace the ships.

On 31 March 2021, the ship was withdrawn from service, and placed up for sale (recycling) on 21 May 2021, however, the notice for recycling was then withdrawn and the ship was sold to Egypt together with her sister ship, &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot;. While awaiting refit, it was reported that &quot;Fort Austin&quot; would be renamed ENS &quot;Luxor&quot;.

<doc id="486004" wikidata="Q2124155" url="?curid=486004" title="RFA Fort George">
<text>RFA &quot;Fort George&quot; was a combined fleet stores ship and tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and one of two s.

&quot;Fort George&quot; was ordered from Swan Hunter in late 1987. The ship was laid down in 1989, launched by the wife of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet Admiral Sir Jock Slater in 1991 and commissioned in 1993. Along with RFA &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;, the ship was equipped with two Phalanx CIWS point defence guns during a refit at Tyne in 1999.

==Operational history==
In March 2000, the ship was equipped with five Westland Sea King helicopters and sent to Mozambique to help with disaster relief work following devastating floods. In May she accompanied the aircraft carrier to Sierra Leone to support British operations to restore stability to that country. Late in the year, during a deployment in the Mediterranean, the ship helped passengers of the Greek ferry &quot;Express Samina&quot; which had run aground and sunk during a storm on 26 September.

In September 2009, &quot;Fort George&quot;, whilst working with the Type 23 frigate , was involved in the largest ever drugs seizure to date by the Royal Navy, when 5.5 tonnes of cocaine were seized from a converted fishing vessel MV &quot;Cristal&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean off South America.

==Disposal==
Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010, the ship was identified for withdrawal. From March 2011 she was being stripped of stores and fittings in Liverpool, where she remained for two years. She left Liverpool on 16 January 2013 under tow destined for a Turkish ship breakers. Her sister ship, , remains in service as of 2023.

<doc id="486005" wikidata="Q7276480" url="?curid=486005" title="RFA Gold Rover">
<text>RFA &quot;Gold Rover&quot; (A271) was a small fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) and one of five ships that were designed by the Admiralty, all of which were built at the Swan Hunter shipyard.

&quot;Gold Rover&quot; and her sister &quot;Black Rover&quot; were the last two in service with the RFA on duty around the world. The class was phased out as part of a worldwide effort to replace single-hulled tankers with more environmentally safe double-hulled vessels. &quot;Gold Rover&quot; herself was decommissioned in a sunset ceremony at Portsmouth Naval Base on 6 March 2017.

==Characteristics==
Ships of the Rover class were predominantly used to transport fuel, oil, and aviation fuel for services around the globe; they could also carry limited dried stores of such as munitions and refrigerated goods. They were built with a flight deck large enough to accommodate two helicopters, although no hangar was fitted.

==Operational history==
===1974–1980===
In July 1974, &quot;Gold Rover&quot; participated in evacuation duties during the partition of Cyprus during the Turkish invasion of the island.

===1981–1990===
&quot;Gold Rover&quot; was in Singapore at the time of the Falklands Conflict in 1982 and therefore took no part in the hostilities.

On 14 November 1984, &quot;Gold Rover&quot; sailed from Gibraltar on completion of refit, the last RFA to be refitted in HM Dockyard Gibraltar.

&quot;Gold Rover&quot; participated in the 1986 Jamaican flood relief operations.

On 1 December 1990, &quot;Gold Rover&quot; lost her rudder in severe weather in the South Atlantic and sent out a distress call. Some of her crew were airlifted off by a Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter of No. 78 Squadron and she managed to get to anchor east of Lively island to ride out the storm before she was towed by the tug &quot;Oil Mariner&quot; to Montevideo for repairs. The crew of the Sea King rescue helicopter, captained by Flt Lt David Kerr-Sheppard, received various awards for outstanding flying skill in such difficult weather conditions.

===1991–2000===
In January 2000, she was towed back to Devonport by two RMAS tugs after breaking down off Lizard Point.

===2001–2010===
2006 was a busy year for &quot;Gold Rover&quot;. She was in Nigeria in June 2006 for the 50th anniversary celebrations of the formation of the Nigerian Navy. As part of the celebrations there was a Fleet Review by President Olusegun Obasanjo. On 6 October she, along with Royal Navy frigate and Royal Marines from 40 Commando, seized more than two tonnes of cocaine during a major drugs haul off the coast of West Africa. The illegal drugs, which were found in an unregistered vessel, had a UK street value of some £60 million.

&quot;Gold Rover&quot; was part of a Royal Navy amphibious task group, the VELA Deployment 06, en route to Sierra Leone where she and other ships were taking part in a major amphibious exercise. Whilst on the way to West Africa &quot;Gold Rover&quot; was contributing to the global fight against terrorism and the Royal Navy&#x27;s maritime security operations activity.

===2011–2017===
&quot;Gold Rover&quot; entered refit in the middle of 2013. &quot;Gold Rover&quot; departed her home port for her last operational deployment in 2014.

Between 12 and 16 October 2015 &quot;Gold Rover&quot; and participated the bicentennial anniversary commemorations of Napoleon&#x27;s arrival on Saint Helena after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, and subsequent surrender to British forces.

In 2015, she participated in Operation UNITAS.

&quot;Gold Rover&quot; entered Portsmouth for the final time on 22 February 2017, bowing out after 43 years of active service. On 29 August 2017 the Defence Equipment Sales Authority (DESA) invited expressions of interest from companies interested in receiving an invitation to tender with respect to the proposed sale for the sole purpose of recycling of the former RFA ship.

She was scrapped at Aliaga on 3 September 2019.

<text>RFA &quot;Bayleaf&quot; (A109) was a Leaf-class support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom, which served with the fleet for 30 years, tasked with providing fuel, food, fresh water, ammunition and other supplies to Royal Navy vessels around the world.

She was involved in the Falklands War in 1982, the Gulf War in 1991, and from January 2003 to April 2003 she was deployed for Operation Telic (Op TELIC), the codename for the United Kingdom&#x27;s military operations in Iraq. &quot;Bayleaf&quot; had three Leaf-class sisters , and and all four were originally designed as commercial tankers and underwent major conversions to bring them up to RFA standards and equip them for naval support.

She was the third Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel to bear the name.

==Construction==
&quot;Bayleaf&quot; was one of four ships ordered from Cammell Laird at Birkenhead in 1973, and laid down in 1975 as the &quot;Hudson Sound&quot;. When the ordering company ran into financial difficulties, the ships were laid up, and later were offered for sale or charter. The ship was finally launched on 27 October 1981, the Lady Sponsor was Mrs Angela Pritchard, the wife of Mr K Pritchard, Director General of the Naval Stores and Transport, Ministry of Defence (MoD). In January 1982 Captain A.E. Hunter, RFA, was appointed as Master and between 20 and 23 March she ran trials and when completed on 25 March she was then bareboat chartered to the MoD and renamed &quot;Bayleaf&quot;.

== Operational history ==

=== 1980s ===

She was almost immediately put into active service, and sailed to Gibraltar and Ascension Island en route for service in &quot;Operation Corporate&quot; – the Falklands War – in company with the Royal Navy&#x27;s amphibious warfare ship . She arrived at the Total Exclusion Zone on 9 June 1982, finally returning to HMMB Devonport on 31 August.

On 30 September 1982 &quot;Bayleaf&quot; sailed from HMNB Devonport in support of the Dartmouth Training Squadron&#x27;s Mediterranean deployment. She arrived at Gibraltar on 4 October and then throughout the months of October and November she called at the Italian city of Naples, followed by Brindisi in Southern Italy, then onto Salonika in Greece, next to Istanbul in Turkey and then the city and seaport of Trieste in Italy, before returning to the United Kingdom, arriving at Plymouth on 24 November.

In December 1982 she sailed from Plymouth to Liverpool and entered refit, exiting in March 1983, then sailed back to Plymouth to re equip. &quot;Bayleaf&quot; spent two weeks in April undergoing Basic Operational Sea Training (BOST) at Portland and then spent May in the Mediterranean taking part in Exercise “Distant Drum”. Between June and August, &quot;Bayleaf&quot; sailed from HMNB Portsmouth to Singapore and back, via Port Said and Bahrain. By the end of 1983 she was back in Gibraltar.

=== 1990s ===

In January 1991 she sailed from the United Kingdom to relieve sister Leaf-class support tanker , during &quot;Operation Granby&quot; – the First Gulf War.

On 1 March 1997 she collided with the Royal Yacht while carrying out a replenishment at sea (RAS) off Karachi.

=== 2000s ===

In 2001 &quot;Bayleaf&quot; was purchased outright by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

On 28 June 2001 she deployed to relieve sister Leaf-class support tanker &quot;Orangeleaf&quot; and was then permanently based in the Gulf. During June and August she performed replenishment at sea (RAS) with various RN, HMCS, USN and other Allied ships, returning to either anchor off Dubai or berthing at Port Rashid. In September she took part in Exercise Argonaut 2001, which included Exercise Saif Sareea, together with the , fourteen other Royal Navy warships and the RFA&#x27;s replenishment ships , and , the Round Table class landing ship logistics , , and (II), sister Leaf class and the forward repair ship .

On 5 September 2002 she provided humanitarian aid, rescuing five crew from the Guinean cargo ship MV &quot;Falcon&quot; which sank in the Indian Ocean, and landed them at Dubai.

From January to April 2003 she was deployed on Operation Telic – the Second Gulf War.

On 2 June she began refit at Singapore and on 23 June Captain Alistair Swatridge, RFA, was appointed as Commanding Officer. Over 11, 12 and 17 August, &quot;Bayleaf&quot; underwent post-refit sea trials, and between 8 and 10 September she underwent Fleet Operational Standards and Training (FOST) in the South China Sea. Between October 2003 and April 2006 she deployed from and berthed at Dubai, Port Rashid and Jebel Ali, taking part in Exercise Khunjar Hadd between 5 and 9 June 2004 and conducting replenishment at sea (RAS) with many RN, RFA, RNZN, RAN, USN and other Allied naval vessels including with the amphibious assault ship and the dock landing ship on 19 February 2006, in the Persian Gulf. She arrived at Sembawang, Singapore, on 8 May 2006 for a refit and on 28 August Captain (X) Kim Watts, RFA, was appointed as commanding officer. Just over a fortnight later, on 14 September, she sailed out of Kepple Yard, Singapore for sea trials and then onto Sembawang, arriving 15 September 2006.

On 1 November 2008 she sailed from HMNB Devonport and entered Cammell Laird, Merseyside, three days later, for a £9.1 m refit. On 7 April 2009, Captain Charles F. Simmons, RFA, was appointed as commanding officer and on 5 June she sailed from Birkenhead, on completion of the refit, to HMNB Devonport. Later in June &quot;Bayleaf&quot; sailed to Loch Striven, a sea loch in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, to undertake various trials there. On 17 July, Captain (X) Nigel Budd, RFA, was appointed as commanding officer.

In autumn 2009 &quot;Bayleaf&quot; underwent FOST at Portland and upon completion sailed to Soudha Bay, Crete, before transiting the Suez Canal arriving at Bahrain on 18 November.

In January 2010 she deployed as the Gulf Tanker, Captain S.P. Donkersly, RFA, was appointed as the new commanding officer on 21 April 2010 and during May, June and July she RAS’ed with many RN, RAN, USN and various other Allied naval vessels.

Following the reductions to the Royal Navy fleet outlined in the 2010 &quot;Strategic Defence and Security Review&quot;, published in October 2010, it was decided that &quot;Bayleaf&quot; would be paid off in April 2011.

On 20 October 2010, Captain Charles F. Simmons, RFA, was appointed as commanding officer and &quot;Bayleaf&quot; continued with various duties until 13 February 2011 when she sailed from Dubai eventually arriving at HMNB Portsmouth on 15 April 2011.

== Decommissioning and fate ==

The Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ensign was lowered for the final time on 20 April 2011 for &quot;Bayleaf&quot;, she was removed from the RFA Flotilla and a ceremony was held to commemorate all she and her crew have achieved since 1982.

LEYAL Ship Recycling Ltd, a Turkish company, were awarded preferred bidder status for the disposal of the vessel in 2012. Following this, the ex-RFA &quot;Bayleaf&quot; was towed out of Portsmouth on 2 August 2012. She arrived in Aliağa, Turkey, on 22 August where the ship was broken up. On 10 December it was reported she had been dismantled and recycled, taking four months to complete.

<doc id="486007" wikidata="Q52315380" url="?curid=486007" title="RFA Fort Rosalie (A385)">
<text>RFA &quot;Fort Rosalie was the lead ship of [[Fort Rosalie-class replenishment ship|her class]] of [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] fleet replenishment ships. &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; was originally namedRFA &quot;Fort Grange, but was renamed in May 2000 to avoid confusion with the now-decommissioned .
On 31 March 2021, the ship was withdrawn from service.

==Construction and design==

In November 1971, two Fleet Replenishment ships of a new class were ordered for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. &quot;Fort Grange&quot; was laid down by the shipbuilder Scott Lithgow at their shipyard at Greenock on the River Clyde on 9 November 1973, was launched on 9 December 1976 and commissioned on 6 April 1978.

The ship is long overall, and length between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement is full load, with a gross register tonnage of 16079 t, a net register tonnage of 6729 t and a deadweight tonnage of 8300 t. The ship is powered by a single 8-cylinder Sulzer RND80 diesel engine, rated at , which drive a single propeller shaft, giving a speed of . She has a range of at .

Up to 3500 tons of weapons, food and other naval stores can be carried in four holds with a volume of . Three stations for alongside replenishment are provided on each beam of the ship. A large hangar and flight deck are located aft, which were designed to accommodate up to four Westland Sea King helicopters for vertical replenishment or for anti-submarine duties, although typically the ship only carries a single helicopter in peacetime. The ship has a crew of 140 RFA personnel who man the ship, 36 Royal Navy personnel who operated and support the ship&#x27;s helicopters and 45 civilian supply staff.

==Service==
The ship saw her first war service during the Falklands War. She was undergoing refit when Argentina invaded the Falklands in April 1982, but the refit was completed early, and &quot;Fort Grange&quot; left Devonport on 14 May 1982 to join the task force, carrying three Sea Kings of 824 Naval Air Squadron. She joined up with the fleet on 3 June, replenishing the ships of the fleet and forces on shore, as well as acting as a refuelling station for helicopters. She remained on station after the end of hostilities, and one of her helicopters was lost following an engine failure on 11 June, but all the crew were saved. &quot;Fort Grange&quot; set off for home on 17 September and reached Devonport on 3 October 1982.
In April 1994, &quot;Fort Grange&quot; was deployed alongside at the port of Split in Croatia, relieving in supporting British forces carrying out peacekeeping duties in the Balkans for seven months. She resumed the support depot role at Split in April 1997, remaining on station until 6 January 2000, when she set out to return to the United Kingdom. &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; also oversaw repairs to at Gibraltar later in 2000. She is affiliated to Tamworth and Lichfield Sea Cadets under her former name, &quot;Fort Grange&quot;.
In 2002 she supported HMS York during the response to 911.She provided the destroyer with fuel and stores whist York operated on operation veritas.

&quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; attended the HMNB Devonport Navy Days in August 2006, representing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

In May 2008 the ship entered a £28 million refit at Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders&#x27; Cammell Laird yard in Birkenhead.

&quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; supported Exercise Cougar 11, the first partial deployment of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Response Force Task Group. In 2011 it was announced that her service life would be extended by two years to 2024; the Fort class will ultimately be replaced by the Fleet Solid Support element of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme.

She spent early 2012 in the Caribbean and made a brief deployment to the Gulf of Oman in December 2012; since then she was exercising in home waters and entered refit in 2013. In June 2020, &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; was reported to be in extended readiness (reserve) with replenishment rigs incompatible with the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers. The Integrated Review of 2020 announced that &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot;, along with &quot;Fort Austin&quot; would be decommissioned, with successors from the Fleet Solid Support plan set to replace the ships.

On 31 March 2021, RFA &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; was withdrawn from service, and offered for sale on 21 May 2021, along with sister ship RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot;, for recycling, however in October 2021 it was announced that the ship, together with her sister ship, had been sold to Egypt. While awaiting refit, it was reported that &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot; would be renamed ENS &quot;Abu Simbel&quot; which was carried out at Liverpool Cruise Terminal on 17 July 2022.

<text>RFA &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; is a Fort-class combined fleet stores ship and tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary of the United Kingdom tasked with providing ammunition, fuel, food and other supplies to Royal Navy vessels around the world. She is now the only member of her class.

==Construction==

&quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was ordered from Harland and Wolff in 1986, and was launched in 1990. She is named after Fort Victoria on the Isle of Wight.

On 6 September 1990, while &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was at dock and less than three months after being christened, a Provisional IRA (IRA) unit planted two explosive devices on board. After a telephone warning from the IRA, one of the bombs exploded, causing extensive damage inside the engine room, which was holed and subsequently flooded. The ship listed 45 degrees, and the chances of sinking were high. The ship was saved after hours of work by emergency teams, who pumped the water out of the engine room. Sir John Parker, chairman and CEO of Harland &amp; Wolff, praised the courage of the engineers for saving the ship. It was not learned that a second device had failed to explode until a second IRA phone call 24 hours later. It took two weeks to find and disable the second bomb, which stalled the works further.

This incident and other problems with the construction of the vessel meant it was not delivered until 1993, two years after originally planned.

She was accepted into service on 24 June 1994. In 1998, the ship was fitted with the Phalanx close-in weapon system.

== Operational history ==
The vessel took part in Operation Telic during early 2003.&quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was adopted by the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and has been affiliated with the borough for over ten years. A battle ensign was presented to the borough in 2003 following the vessel&#x27;s participation in military operations in the Persian Gulf. The ensign can be seen in the foyer of Barnsley Town Hall.

With her ability to supply anything from humanitarian supplies to fuel and ammunition, &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; has uses in peacetime and war. An example of this was the Operation Highbrow in Lebanon, where she played a key role in supplying the Royal Navy and giving air support with a flight of Merlin MK1 helicopters from 814 squadron.

From November 2008 until May 2009 she underwent a refit on the Mersey by Cammell Laird Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders, being towed up from the Solent by tugs &quot;Red Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Englishman&quot;. She returned to operational status in November 2009, and was set to rejoin the RFA fleet by the early months of 2010. The ship has undergone another refit from March 2014 to December 2014. The refit included the main engines receiving an overhaul, other machinery, pumps and pipework, new fire-detecting and fire-fighting systems, six new main generators, living quarters refurbished, and weapons and sensors also completely overhauled. This £50 million refit will allow the ship to serve for at least another 15 years.

===Indian Ocean deployments===
In September 2010, &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was posted to the Indian Ocean as part of Operation Ocean Shield, the NATO mission to combat piracy. She has subsequently been involved in several operations against pirates off the coast of Somalia. In June 2011 &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was deployed off the coast of Yemen with an embarked force of 80 Royal Marines to assist with the possible evacuation of British nationals from that country due to the recent political unrest there. Britain&#x27;s foreign secretary, William Hague, had advised British nationals to leave the country immediately saying that it was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; that the UK government would be able to stage an evacuation operation.

On 11 October 2011 &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;, along with , was involved in the release of the Italian ship &quot;Montecristo&quot; after it was hijacked by Somali pirates. The pirates surrendered without resistance. &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; continued her deployment in the western Indian Ocean into early 2012. On 12 January she foiled an attempt by pirates to attack cargo ships in the Indian Ocean by forcing a previously hijacked tanker, &quot;Liquid Velvet&quot;, now being used as a pirate mothership, to return to Somalia. On 13 January 2012, Royal Marines operating from &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; captured 13 Somali pirates in the Western Indian Ocean after they refused to stop despite warning shots fired from a Royal Navy helicopter. The commanding officer of &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;, Captain Shaun Jones RFA, said: 

On 14 May 2012, during its 2012 deployment, U.S. helicopter squadron HSM-77 Detachment Five completed its temporary operational rotation on board &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; which was serving as the flagship for Combined Task Force 151. This was the first time that a MH-60R helicopter had ever operated from a Royal Navy ship. The detachment&#x27;s helicopters primarily concentrated on anti-piracy surveillance missions during this two-week period.

For her four-month-long 2013 deployment, &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; relieved and operated with Task Force 53 in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. In September 2013 she took over as flagship of Combined Task Force 151 tackling piracy off Somalia. In mid-2013, she sailed with the COUGAR 13 task group.

===Refit and carrier support===

In July 2017, &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; returned to the UK following an extended 26-month deployment, much of which was spent East of Suez in support of anti-piracy operations. This included three months in the Aegean Sea in April 2016 on operation Bucktail monitoring activities of people traffickers in the Lesbos region, taking over from . Following her return, during 2017–2018, the ship underwent an extensive refit intended to allow her to support the s and meet current tanker anti-pollution hull requirements upon her re-entry into service. &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; returned to service in November 2018. In October 2020, she joined a nine-ship UK Carrier Strike Group and performed her first manoeuvres with HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;.

On 11 May 2021 &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; suffered a small fire whilst alongside in Portland preparing for the Carrier Strike Group 2021 deployment, carrying munitions, fuel and other stores. Emergency services were called to the scene. However, the crew were able to successfully extinguish the small fire before their arrival. Four personnel were treated for smoke inhalation by ambulance crews and were taken to hospital but were not seriously injured. 

The ship was in refit in 2022 for an upgrade to her engines as well as other repairs. She was initially reported to have returned to active operations in December 2022. However, in May 2023 it was reported that the ship continued to suffer from significant problems that required rectification, and would likely maintain only a skeleton crew through 2023. Subsequently it was reported that the ship was &quot;mechanically sound&quot; and in an emergency could support an unplanned carrier group deployment, though this would then require taking sailors from other ships due to RFA personnel shortages. In early 2024, the ship was reported to be &quot;in the care of the Cammell Laird shipyard&quot; and in &quot;poor condition&quot;. She was expected to remain in refit through 2024. In late 2024, it was reported that she would be placed in &quot;extended readiness&quot; (uncrewed reserve) for at least a year.

===Replacement===

The replacement of &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; with the first of a new class of Fleet Solid Support Ship had been envisaged in around 2028. In July 2022, Rear-Admiral Paul Marshall, the Senior Responsible Officer for the Fleet Solid Support ship project, told the House of Commons Select Defence Committee that the lead ship of this class was envisaged for service entry in 2028. However, subsequently the Ministry of Defence indicated that the first ship of the new class would in fact not be operational until 2031. The MoD also indicated that it was therefore planned to maintain &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; in service for the required additional transitional period.

<text>RFA &quot;Oakleaf&quot; (A111) was a Leaf-class fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom. Formerly the Swedish vessel MV &quot;Oktania&quot;, built by A. B. Uddevalla, Sweden, and completed in 1981, &quot;Oakleaf&quot; was added to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1986, before being decommissioned in 2007.

She was the second Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel to bear the name.

==Role==
As well as their role of replenishing warships at sea, support tankers perform the bulk movement of fuels between Ministry of Defense (Navy) depots. The &quot;Oakleaf&quot; had three Leaf-class sisters - &quot;Brambleleaf&quot;, &quot;Bayleaf&quot; and &quot;Orangeleaf&quot;. All four were originally designed as commercial tankers and underwent major conversions to bring them up to Royal Fleet Auxiliary standards and equip them for naval support. These involved adding a considerable amount of electronics, both in communications and navigational aids, fitting two replenishment rigs and increasing the amount of accommodation.

While the ships can provide some food and stores support, their main cargoes are diesel and aviation fuel. &quot;Oakleaf&quot; was capable of replenishing ships with fuel using a standard jackstay or derrick rig abeam and towed rig for astern replenishment. She was fitted to take containers on her main deck for the provision of stores and to enhance ship&#x27;s stores capabilities for long deployments.

==Design==
The normal complement was 36, composed of officers and senior and junior ratings. Among the departments, the PO (Supply) was responsible for 5,000 stores line items as well as for food and drink, clothing and bedding. The RISC (Royal Fleet Auxiliary Interim Stores Computer) system was his only assistant on board.

&quot;Oakleaf&quot; was powered by a four-cylinder Burmeister and Wain long stroke oil engine capable of developing driving a single controllable-pitch propeller. She also had bow and stern variable-pitch thrust propellers. Fitted with automatic power management, the vessel could be operated with her machinery spaces unmanned - as with her sister ships, her engines could be controlled from either the ship&#x27;s bridge or the (air conditioned) machinery control room.

== Operational history ==

On 29 March 1985 approval was given to charter MV &quot;Oktania&quot; to replace the Leaf-class support tanker and she was purchased in June by James Fisher &amp; Sons, Barrow-in-Furness, for bareboat charter to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). By September she had arrived on Tyneside for formal docking and inspection, and had approval granted by Lloyd&#x27;s Register and the Admiralty Ship’s Name and Badge Committee, for her new name. At the end of the year invitations to tender were issued, for her conversion. At the start of 1986 she was officially presented with her Ship&#x27;s Badge and in February her £5m, six month conversion work began at Falmouth, Cornwall, by Falmouth Shiprepairer Ltd. Upon completion in August, she ran sea trials and was formally renamed &quot;Oakleaf&quot;. Captain Bruce Seymour, RFA, took command and &quot;Oakleaf&quot; sailed for Plymouth, Devon, to store and then to Portland for Basic Operational Sea Training (BOST).

&quot;Oakleaf&quot;″s maiden voyage was a trip to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in September 1986. In March 1987 she berthed at Pensacola, Florida and by 25 March she had returned to Rosyth, Scotland. In September 1988 the vessel was involved in humanitarian relief operations in the Caribbean following Hurricane Gilbert, supporting the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 21 frigate .

The Royal Navy acted in support of United Nations resolutions and &quot;Oakleaf&quot; provided extensive support and replenished ships of an international maritime task force, formed as part of United States-led Operation Uphold Democracy, in Haiti, in September 1994.

In July 1995, the West Indies Guardship, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 42 destroyer and her support ship, &quot;Oakleaf&quot; provided assistance following volcanic activity on the island of Montserrat.

In September 2001 she took part in Exercise Argonaut 2001, which included Exercise Saif Sareea, together with the , fourteen other Royal Navy warships along with the RFA’s replenishment ships , and , the Round Table class landing ship logistics , , and (II), sister ship and forward repair ship .

== Decommissioning and fate ==

In 2007 it was announced that &quot;Oakleaf&quot; would be reduced to “zero manning” along with Leaf class sister . She was later decommissioned from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and laid up awaiting disposal at Her Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base in Portsmouth.

LEYAL Ship Recycling Ltd, a Turkish company, were awarded preferred bidder status for the disposal of the vessel. Ex-RFA &quot;Oakleaf&quot; left Portsmouth on 29 September 2010 in the tow of tug &quot;Mega One&quot; for Aliağa, Turkey, for breaking, arriving on 22 October 2010. On 31 January 2011 it was reported she had been dismantled and recycled, taking three months to complete.

<text>RFA &quot;Black Rover&quot; was a small fleet tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). She was designed to replenish ships underway at sea with fuel, fresh water, and stores in all weather conditions. She had a helicopter deck served by a stores lift and was capable of conducting helicopter replenishment. Displacing 16,160 tonnes, she was powered by twin diesels and has a ship&#x27;s company of 60.

==History==

&quot;Black Rover&quot; was launched by Swan Hunter on 30 August 1973 and was accepted into service the following year. She was in refit in Rosyth during the Falklands Conflict and took no part in the efforts to liberate the islands.

&quot;Black Rover&quot; was deployed from UK in June 2005 and its tasking included assisting with post-tsunami reconstruction and participation in multi-national exercises in the Far East as the UK&#x27;s component of the Five Power Defence Arrangement.

In 2006 she was the Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) tanker, and in September she hosted the RFA recruitment video film crew. Her role as FOST tanker allowed the film makers to capture many of the RFA&#x27;s capabilities. The busy nature of the FOST schedule allowed the film crew to experience a wide variety of exercises and evolutions during their time on board.

In 2013, &quot;Black Rover&quot; deployed to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia.

&quot;Black Rover&quot; was scheduled to decommission in 2016 however she never returned to sea under her own power after docking in Birkenhead in September 2015.

==Disposal==
In March 2017, after 18 months alongside in Birkenhead, &quot;Black Rover&quot; was towed to Portsmouth. On 29 August 2017 the Defence Equipment Sales Authority (DESA) invited expressions of interest from companies interested in receiving an invitation to tender in respect to the proposed sale for the sole purpose of recycling of the former RFA ship. She departed Portsmouth under tow on 11 August and arrived at Aliaga on 1 September 2019. Scrapping was completed on 20 January 2020.

<doc id="486017" wikidata="Q196546" url="?curid=486017" title="Syed Ahmad Khan">
<text>Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (17 October 1817 – 27 March 1898), also spelled Sayyid Ahmad Khan, was an Indian Muslim reformer, philosopher, and educationist in nineteenth-century British India. 

Though initially espousing Hindu–Muslim unity, he later became the pioneer of Muslim nationalism in India and is widely credited as the father of the two-nation theory, which formed the basis of the Pakistan movement. Born into a family with strong ties to the Mughal court, Ahmad studied science and the Quran within the court. He was awarded an honorary LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1889.

In 1838, Syed Ahmad entered the service of East India Company and went on to become a judge at a Small Causes Court in 1867, retiring from this position in 1876. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, he remained loyal to the British Raj and was noted for his actions in saving European lives. After the rebellion, he penned the booklet &quot;The Causes of the Indian Mutiny&quot; – a daring critique, at the time, of various British policies that he blamed for causing the revolt. Believing that the future of Muslims was threatened by the rigidity of their orthodox outlook, Sir Ahmad began promoting Western–style scientific education by founding modern schools and journals and organizing Islamic entrepreneurs. Victoria School at Ghazipur in 1863, and a scientific society for Muslims in 1864. In 1875, founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, the first Muslim university in Southern Asia. During his career, Syed repeatedly called upon Muslims to loyally serve the British Raj and promoted the adoption of Urdu as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of all Indian Muslims. Syed criticized the Indian National Congress.

Sir Syed maintains a strong legacy in Pakistan and among Indian Muslims. He became a source of inspiration for the Pakistan Movement and its activists, including Allama Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. His advocacy of Islam&#x27;s rationalist tradition, and a broader, radical reinterpretation of the Quran to make it compatible with science and modernity, continues to influence the global Islamic reformation. Many universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Sir Syed&#x27;s name. Aligarh Muslim University celebrated Sir Syed&#x27;s 200th birth centenary with much enthusiasm on 17 October 2017.

==Early life==

Syed Ahmad Taqvi &#x27;Khan Bahadur&#x27; was born on 17 October 1817 to Syed Muhammad Muttaqi and Aziz-un-Nisa in Delhi, which was the capital of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar II. Many generations of his family had been highly connected with the Mughal administration. His maternal grandfather Khwaja Fariduddin served as &quot;Wazir&quot; in the court of Emperor Akbar Shah II. His paternal grandfather Syed Hadi Jawwad bin Imaduddin held a &quot;mansab&quot; (lit. General) – a high-ranking administrative position - and the honorary name of &quot;Mir Jawwad Ali Khan&quot; in the court of Emperor Alamgir II. Sir Syed&#x27;s father, Syed Muhammad Muttaqi, was personally close to Emperor Akbar Shah II and served as his personal adviser. However, Syed Ahmad was born at a time when his father was involved in regional insurrections aided and led by the East India Company, which had replaced the power traditionally held by the Mughal state, reducing its monarch to a figurehead.

Syed Ahmad was the youngest of three siblings. With his elder brother Syed Muhammad bin Muttaqi Khan and elder sister Safiyatun Nisa, Sir Syed was raised in the house of his maternal grandfather in a wealthy area of the city. They were raised in strict accordance with Mughal noble traditions and they were exposed to politics. Their mother Aziz-un-Nisa played a formative role in Sir Syed&#x27;s early life, raising him with rigid discipline and a strong emphasis on modern education.

==Education==
Sir Syed&#x27;s education was initiated by Shah Ghulam Ali, his father&#x27;s spiritual mentor in 1822. He was taught to read and understand the Qur&#x27;an by a female tutor Areeba Sehar. He received an education traditional to Muslim nobility in Delhi. He attended a maktab run by a learned scholar, Moulvi Hamiduddin, in a house adjacent to his ancestral home and started learning Persian and Arabic. He read the works of Muslim scholars and writers such as Sahbai, Zauq and Ghalib. Other tutors instructed him in mathematics, astronomy and algebra. He also pursued the study of medicine for several years under Hakim Ghulam Haider Khan. Sir Syed was also adept at swimming, shooting and other sports. He took an active part in the Mughal court&#x27;s cultural activities and attended parties, festivals and recitations.

Syed Ahmad&#x27;s elder brother launched a weekly, “Syedul Akhbar”, from Delhi, which was one of the earliest Urdu newspapers in northern India. Until the death of his father in 1838, Sir Syed had lived a life customary for an affluent young Muslim noble. Upon his father&#x27;s death, he inherited the titles of his grandfather and father and was awarded the title of &quot;Arif Jung&quot; by the emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. Financial difficulties put an end to Sir Syed&#x27;s formal education, although he continued to study in private, using books on a variety of subjects.

==Career==
Having recognized the steady decline in Mughal political power, Sir Syed decided to enter the service of the East India Company. He could not enter the colonial civil service because it was only in the 1860s that Indians were admitted. His first appointment was as a &quot;Serestadar&quot; (lit. Clerk) of the Criminal Department in the Sadr Amin&#x27;s office in Delhi, responsible for record-keeping and managing court affairs. In February 1839, he was transferred to Agra and promoted to the title of &quot;Naib Munshi&quot; or deputy reader in the office of the Commissioner. In 1841 he was appointed as the &quot;Munsif&quot; or Sub-Judge of Fatehpur Sikri and later transferred to Delhi in 1846. He remained in Delhi until 1854 except for two short-term postings to Rohtak as officiating &quot;Sadr Amin&quot; in 1850 and 1853. In 1855 he was promoted to the post of &quot;Sadr Amin&quot; in Bijnor.

Acquainted with high-ranking British officials, Sir Syed obtained close knowledge about British colonial politics during his service at the courts. At the outbreak of the Indian rebellion, on 10 May 1857, Sir Syed was serving as the chief assessment officer at the court in Bijnor. He stood by the British officers of Bijnor and saved the lives of many officers and their family members from the revolting soldiers. The conflict had left large numbers of civilians dead. Erstwhile centres of Muslim power such as Delhi, Agra, Lucknow and Kanpur were severely affected. He lost several close relatives who died in the violence. Although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil, she died in Meerut, owing to the privations she had experienced.

In 1858, he was appointed as &quot;Sadarus Sudoor&quot;, a high-ranking post at the court in Muradabad, where he began working on his most famous literary work, &quot;The Cause of the Indian Revolt&quot;. In 1862, he was transferred to Ghazipur, and later to Aligarh in 1864. In 1864 he was sent to Banaras and elevated to the position of a Sub-Judge of Small Causes.

In April 1869, he accompanied his two sons Syed Hamid and Syed Mahmood to England, the latter had obtained a scholarship to study in England.

Sir Syed retired from government service in 1876 and settled in Aligarh. In 1878, he was nominated as an additional member of the Imperial Legislative Council, which he served from July 1878 to July 1880. He also served a second term that lasted until 1883. He served the Legislative Council of the Lieutenant Governor of the North- Western Provinces for two terms from 1887 until 1893.

==Influences==
Sir Syed&#x27;s early influences were his mother Aziz-un-Nisa and maternal grandfather Khwaja Fariduddin both of whom took special interest in his education. Apart from serving as a Wazir in the Mughal court, Khwaja Fariduddin was also a teacher, mathematician and astronomer. He was also disposed towards Sufism, which left its impact on Sir Syed since his early childhood. His maternal uncle Khwaja Zainuddin Ahmad, who was an expert in music and mathematics, also influenced him in his early days.

Sir Syed&#x27;s early theological writings demonstrate the influence of three school of religious thought on his outlook - the Naqshbandi tradition of Shah Ghulam Ali Dahlavi, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and his teachings, and the Mujahidin movement of Syed Ahmad Barelvi and his earliest disciple Shah Ismail Dehlvi. While Sir Syed shared the desire for religious forms in India with the Mujahidin movement, he was opposed to the Indian Wahhabi movement.

During his formative years in Delhi he came in contact with Ghalib and Zauq whose exquisite style of prose and poetry influenced Sir Syed&#x27;s style of writing. He would often visit Imam Baksh Sahbai and Sadruddin Khan Azurda Dehlawi in his learning years. Another influence on him was his teacher and friend in Agra, Nur al Hasan of Kandhala, a teacher in Arabic at Agra College in the early 1840s who encouraged and corrected his early works.

He was also influenced by the works of the Tunisian reformer Hayreddin Pasha and adopted his approach of utilising freedom of expression for bringing reforms in the Muslim community.

The western writers who most influenced his political thoughts were the Utilitarians such as John Stuart Mill, whose works he often quoted in his own writings. He was also influenced by the essays of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele and modelled his own journals after their &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot;.

==Literary works==
While continuing to work as a junior clerk, Sir Syed began focusing on writing, from the age of 23 (in 1840), on various subjects (from mechanics to educational issues), mainly in Urdu, where he wrote, at least, 6000 pages. He also wrote a well known book on archaeology called Athar-ul-Sandeed. He also developed interest in literature as he met a few of India&#x27;s well known writers.

===Religious works===
Sir Syed Ahmad Khan&#x27;s career as an author began when he published a series of treatises in Urdu on religious subjects in 1842. In his early religious writings his religious thoughts were more orthodox; over time, with his increasing contact with the West, his views gradually became more independent. His early works show the influence of Sufism and his upbringing in Delhi. The main themes of these works are popularization of the practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad as the one true path and the desire to reform the lives of Indian Muslims from religious innovations, thus endeavoring for the purity of Islamic belief in India.

His later religious writings, such as his commentary on the Torah and Gospel and his essays on Muhammad, were stimulated in response to Christian missionary activities in India and the aggressive view of British historians towards Islam.

====Early treatises====
His first treatise published in 1842 was a biographical sketch of Muhammad, called &quot;Jila al-Qulub bi Zikr al-Mahbub&quot; (&quot;Delight of the Hearts in Remembering the Beloved&quot;), in line with the reformist ideas of Shah Waliullah. It was prose for recitation on Mawlid written in idiomatic Urdu. He published his second treatise &quot;Tuhfa-i Hasan&quot; (&quot;The Gift to Hasan&quot;) in 1844 on the encouragement of his friend Nur al Hasan. It is an Urdu translation of the tenth and twelfth chapter of Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi&#x27;s &quot;Tuhfah-i Ithna Ashariyya&quot; (&quot;A treatise on the 12 Imams&quot;), which was a critique of Shia beliefs. The tenth chapter deals and answers the Shia accusations against the Sahabi and Hazrat Aisha and the twelfth deals with the Shia doctrines of tawalli and tabarri.

His third treatise, entitled &quot;Kalimat al-Haqq&quot; (&quot;The True Discourse&quot;), was published in 1849. It is a critique of the prevalent Sufi practices around &quot;pir–murid&quot; relationships. The first part of the work is devoted to the concept of &quot;piri&quot;. In this part, he argues that Muhammad is the only valid pir. The work&#x27;s second part is focused on &quot;muridi&quot; and the notion of &quot;bay&#x27;ah.&quot; He calls for reforms in the pir-murid relationship and the associated practises. &quot;Rah i Sunna dar radd i Bid&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;The Sunna and the Rejection of Innovations&quot;), his fourth treatise, was published in 1850. In this work, he expressed his opposition to certain religious practices and beliefs of his fellow Muslims, which he felt were mixed with innovation and deviated from the true Sunnah. In 1852 he published &quot;Namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwur-i-Shaikh&quot; (&quot;A Letter Explaining the Teaching of tasawwur i shaikh&quot;), in which he defended &quot;tasawwur-i-Shaikh&quot;, the Sufi practice of visualizing within, the image of one&#x27;s spiritual guide. In 1853 he translated some passages of al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Kimiya al Sa&#x27;ada&quot; (&quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot;).

====Commentary of the Torah and Gospel====
In 1862 while stationed at Ghazipur, Sir Syed started working on a commentary on the Bible and its teaching, with the aim to explain them in terms of Islam. It was published in Urdu and English in three parts from 1862 to 1865 under the title &quot;Tabin al-al-kalam Fi tafsir altawrat Wa ‘I-injil’ala millat al Islam&quot; (&quot;Elucidation of the World in Commentary of the Torah and Gospel According to the Religion of Islam&quot;). While the first part deals with the Islamic approach towards biblical writings, the second and third part contains commentary on the Book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew respectively.

====&quot;Essays on the Life of Muhammad&quot;====
In 1869 he wrote &quot;Al-Khutbat al-Ahmadiya fi&#x27;l Arab wa&#x27;I Sirat al-Muhammadiya&quot; (&quot;A Series of Essays on the Life of Prophet Muhammad and Subjects Subsidiary Therein&quot;) as a rejoinder to William Muir&#x27;s widely known four-part book, &quot;The Life of Mahomet&quot; published in 1864. He was deeply distressed by Muir&#x27;s portrayal of Islam and the character of Muhammad. He was concerned that the book might create doubts among the younger generation of Muslims. In order to prepare for the book, he accompanied his son to England, as he wanted to get a first-hand impression of Western civilisation.

He was also a reader of Darwin and, while not agreeing with all of his ideas, he could be described as a sort of theistic evolutionist like his contemporary Asa Gray. Syed Ahmad was one of the first in the Islamic world to adopt this view. His arguments in favour of the idea were based on both findings from his own scientific research and quotes from earlier Islamic scholars like Al-Jahiz, Ibn Khaldun and Shah Waliullah.

====Tafsir-ul-Quran====
Sir Syed started working on a tafsir, or commentary on the Quran, in 1877. It was published as &quot;Tafsir ul-Quran&quot; in seven volumes; the first volume appeared in 1880 and the last volume was published six years after his death in 1904. In this work, he analysed and interpreted 16 paras and 13 surahs of the Quran. In the first volume, he also included a detailed article titled &quot;Tahrir fi Usool al-Tafsir&quot; (&quot;The Notes on the Principles of Commentary&quot;), in which he laid down 15 principles on which he based his commentary.

===Historical works===
History was Sir Syed&#x27;s preferred area of study and in 1840, Sir Syed compiled a book of chronological tables about the Timurid rulers of Delhi from Timur to Bahadur Shah Zafar at the behest of Robert N. C. Hamilton, his patron. It was later published under the title &quot;Jam-i-Jum&quot; (&quot;Jamshed&#x27;s Cup&quot;). In &quot;Silsilat-ul-Mulk&quot; he compiled the biographical data of all the rulers of Delhi in history. During his stay in Bijnor, he wrote a history on the city of Bijnor, but it was destroyed during the 1857 rebellion. He also wrote critical editions of books like Ziauddin Barani&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-e-Firoz Shahi&quot; published in 1862, and &quot;Tuzk-e-Jahangiri&quot; published in 1864. However, his most important historical works that brought him fame as a scholar were the two editions of &quot;Asar-us-Sanadid&quot; and that of the &quot;Ain-e-Akbari&quot;.

====Asar-us-Sanadid====
In 1847, he published the book &quot;Asar-us-Sanadid&quot; (&quot;The Remnants of Ancient Heroes&quot;) documenting antiquities of Delhi dating from the medieval era. The work is divided into four sections: the first describes the buildings outside the city of Delhi; the second describes the buildings around the Delhi Fort; the third describes the monuments in Shahjahanabad; and the last section presents a brief historical account of the various settlements of Delhi as well as the prominent inhabitants of Delhi, including Sufis (such as Shah Ghulam Ali and Saiyid Ahmad Shahid), physicians, scholars, poets, calligraphers, and musicians. It also contained around 130 illustrations drawn by Faiz Ali Khan and Mirza Shahrukh Beg, which were the first lithographically produced book illustrations in India. Syed Ahmad released the second edition of &quot;Ansar-as-Sanadid&quot; in 1854. However, the second edition was radically different from the first – the second was abbreviated and more factual. This work brought Sir Syed a wider fame and earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar. In 1861, it was translated into French by Gracin de Tassy in Paris. The book was also presented to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in London, which made him an honorary fellow.

====Ain-e-Akbari====

In 1855, he finished his scholarly, and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl&#x27;s &quot;A&#x27;in-e Akbari&quot;. The first and the third volume of the work were both published in 1855. The second volume, sent to the publisher in 1857, was destroyed in the rebellion that took place that year. Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a &quot;taqriz&quot; (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he did produce was a short Persian poem castigating the A&#x27;in-e Akbari, and by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he praised sky-high the &quot;sahibs of England&quot; who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world.

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the &quot;A&#x27;in-e Akbari&quot; and in fact gave up taking an active interest in history and archaeology. He did edit another two historical texts over the next few years, but neither of them was anything like the &quot;A&#x27;in&quot;: a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of Akbar.

===Political works===
During the uprising of 1857, Sir Syed was posted as a chief assessment officer at the court in Bijnor. He recorded the history of the mutiny in &quot;Tarikh i Sarkashi-ye Bijnor&quot; (&quot;History of the Bijnor Rebellion&quot;), which was published in 1858. He was deeply worried about the consequences of the mutiny for his fellow Muslims in particular. He wrote a number of articles and pamphlets such as &quot;Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind&quot; (&quot;The Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot;), &quot;Loyal Muhammadans of India&quot;, and &quot;Review on Dr Hunter&#x27;s Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel Against the Queen?&quot; to defend Muslims and Islam and create a cordial relations between the British authorities and the Muslim community.

====&quot;Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot;====
Sir Syed supported the East India Company during the 1857 uprising, a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as Jamaluddin Afghani. In 1859 Sir Syed published the booklet &quot;Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind&quot; (&quot;The Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot;) in Urdu in which he studied the causes of the Indian revolt. In this, his most famous work, he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by Muslim elites, who resented the diminishing influence of Muslim monarchs. He blamed the East India Company for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of British politicians regarding Indian culture. Sir Syed advised the British to appoint Muslims to assist in administration, to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ (a vulgar deed) such as the mutiny.

Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali wrote in the biography of Sir Syed that: &quot;As soon as Sir Syed reached Muradabad, he began to write the pamphlet entitled &quot;The Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot; (&quot;Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind&quot;), in which he did his best to clear the people of India, and especially the Muslims, of the charge of Mutiny. In spite of the obvious danger, he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the Government and refused theory which the British had invented to explain the causes of the Mutiny.&quot;

When the work was finished, without waiting for an English translation, Sir Syed sent the Urdu version to be printed at the Mufassilat Gazette Press in Agra. Within a few weeks, he received 500 copies back from the printers. One of his friends warned him not to send the pamphlet to the British Parliament or to the Government of India. Rae Shankar Das, a great friend of Sir Syed, begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger. Sir Syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the British for the good of his own people, of his country, and of the government itself. He said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of India alike, he would gladly suffer whatever befell him. When Rae Shankar Das saw that Sir Syed&#x27;s mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it, he wept and remained silent. After performing a supplementary prayer and asking God&#x27;s blessing, Sir Syed sent almost all the 500 copies of his pamphlet to England, one to the government, and kept the rest himself.

When the government of India had the book translated and presented before the council, Lord Canning, the governor-general, and Sir Bartle Frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report. The foreign secretary Cecil Beadon, however, severely attacked it, calling it &#x27;an extremely seditious pamphlet&#x27;. He wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author, unless he could give a satisfactory explanation, should be harshly dealt with. Since no other member of the Council agreed with his opinion, his attack did no harm.

Later, Sir Syed was invited to attend Lord Canning&#x27;s durbar in Farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there. He told Sir Syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the government&#x27;s interests at heart, he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country; he would have communicated it directly to the government. Sir Syed replied that he had only had 500 copies printed, the majority of which he had sent to England, one had been given to the government of India, and the remaining copies were still in his possession. Furthermore, he had the receipt to prove it. He was aware, he added, that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times, which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective. It was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly. He promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in India he would personally pay 1,000 rupees. At first, Beadon was not convinced and asked Sir Syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in India. Sir Syed reassured him on this matter, and Beadon never mentioned it again. Later he became one of Sir Syed&#x27;s strongest supporters.

Many official translations were made of the Urdu text of &quot;The Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot;. The one undertaken by the India Office formed the subject of many discussions and debates. The pamphlet was also translated by the government of India and several members of parliament, but no version was offered to the public. A translation which had been started by Auckland Colvin, a government official was finished by Sir Syed&#x27;s friend, Colonel G.F.I. Graham, and finally published in 1873.

====Loyal Muhammadans of India====
In 1860, Sir Syed wrote a series of bilingual pamphlets called the Risala Khair Khwahan-e Musalmanan-e-Hind (An Account of the Loyal Mohammedans of India) from Meerut containing episodes in the life of those Muslims who stood by the British during the 1857 uprising. It was published in three issues, the first and second issues appeared in 1860, while the third was published in 1861. The first issue highlighted the bravery of those Muslims who stood by the British while the second issue carried an article on jihad in which he makes a clear distinction between jihad and rebellion.

====Review on Hunter&#x27;s Indian Musalmans====
In August 1871 William Wilson Hunter, a Scottish historian and member of the Indian Civil Service published &quot;Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel Against the Queen?&quot; in which he discussed the Indian Wahabi movement, its role in the rebellion and argued that the Muslims were a threat to the Empire. Hunter links Wahhabism with rebellion and terms them as self-stylised jihadis. His accusations led to the prosecution of Muslims in India especially in the North Western Provinces and those associated with Wahhabism were severely punished. Many Muslims found his arguments one-sided and this prompted Sir Syed to write a rejoinder of the book. He reviewed the book in &quot;The Pioneer&quot; in a series of articles which were reprinted in &quot;Aligarh Institute Gazette&quot; from 24 November 1871, to 23 February 1872. They were later collected and published in a book in England by Hafiz Ahmad Hasan, the Vakil of Tonk. Sir Syed based his arguments upon Muhammad&#x27;s own conduct during holy wars.

==Muslim reformer==

Through the 1850s, Syed Ahmad Khan began developing a strong passion for education. While pursuing studies of different subjects including European jurisprudence, Sir Syed began to realise the advantages of Western-style education, which was being offered at newly established colleges across India. Despite being a devout Muslim, Sir Syed criticised the influence of traditional dogma and religious orthodoxy, which had made most Indian Muslims suspicious of British influences. Sir Syed began feeling increasingly concerned for the future of Muslim communities. A scion of Mughal nobility, Sir Syed had been reared in the finest traditions of Muslim elite culture and was aware of the steady decline of Muslim political power across India. The animosity between the British and Muslims before and after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 threatened to marginalise Muslim communities across India for many generations.

===Scientific Society===
Sir Syed intensified his work to promote co-operation with British authorities, promoting loyalty to the Empire amongst Indian Muslims. Committed to working for the upliftment of Muslims, Sir Syed founded a modern madrassa in Muradabad in 1859; this was one of the first religious schools to impart scientific education. Sir Syed also worked on social causes, helping to organise relief for the famine-struck people of North-West Province in 1860. While posted in Ghazipur in 1863, he established a madrasa which later became the Victoria High school. He also formed the Scientific Society in Ghazipur to promote educational reforms across the country. He wrote an insightful tract on education titled &quot;Iltimas Ba Khidmat-e-Sakinan-e-Hind Dar Bab-e- Taraqqi Taleem in Ahl-e-Hind&quot; (&quot;Address to the natives of Hindoostan on education&quot;).

Upon his transfer to Aligarh in 1864, Sir Syed began working wholeheartedly as an educator. The Scientific Society was transferred from Ghazipur to Aligarh and rechristened as the Scientific Society of Aligarh. Modelling it after the Royal Society and the Royal Asiatic Society, Sir Syed assembled Muslim scholars from different parts of the country. The Society held annual conferences, disbursed funds for educational causes and regularly published a journal on scientific subjects in English and Urdu. Sir Syed felt that the socio-economic future of Muslims was threatened by their orthodox aversions to modern science and technology. He published many writings promoting liberal, rational interpretations of Islamic scriptures, struggling to find rational interpretations for jinn, angels, and miracles of the prophets. 
One example was the reaction to his argument – which appeared in his &quot;tafsir&quot; (exegesis) of the Quran – that &quot;riba&quot; referred to interest charges when lending money to the poor, but not to the rich, nor to borrowers &quot;in trade or in industry&quot;, since this finance supported &quot;trade, national welfare and prosperity&quot;. While many jurists declared all interest to be riba, (according to Sir Syed) this was based &quot;on their own authority and deduction&quot; rather than the Quran.

===Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College===
On 1 April 1869 he went, along with his sons Syed Mahmood and Syed Hamed, to England, where he was awarded the Order of the Star of India from the British government on 6 August. Travelling across England, he visited its colleges and was inspired by the culture of learning established after the Renaissance. Sir Syed returned to India in the following year determined to build a school modelled on Cambridge and Oxford imparting modern education to Indians. Upon his return, he established the &quot;Khwastgaran-i-Taraqqi-i-Talim-i-Musalman&quot; (Committee for the Better Diffusion and Advancement of Learning among Muhammadans) on 26 December 1870. By 1872, it was converted into a Fund Committee for the establishment of a school. Sir Syed described his vision of the institution he proposed to establish in an article written sometime in 1872 and re-printed in the Aligarh Institute Gazette of 5 April 1911:

I may appear to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of Oxford or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be mosques attached to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a &quot;Unani Hakim&quot;. It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers (namaz) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved &quot;chugha&quot; and a red &quot;Fez&quot; cap... Bad and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a &quot;liar&quot; will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited. They will have food either on tables of European style or on chaukis in the manner of the Arabs... Smoking of cigarette or &quot;huqqa&quot; and the chewing of betels shall be strictly prohibited. No corporal punishment or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student&#x27;s self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that Shia and Sunni boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true.&quot;

He began publishing the journal &quot;Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq&quot; (&quot;Social Reformer&quot;) on 24 December 1870 to spread awareness and knowledge on modern subjects and promote reforms in Muslim society. Sir Syed worked to promote reinterpretation of Muslim ideology in order to reconcile tradition with Western education. He argued in several books on Islam that the Qur&#x27;an rested on an appreciation of reason and natural law, making scientific inquiry important to being a good Muslim.

By 1873, the committee under Sir Syed issued proposals for the construction of a college in Aligarh. Maulvi Samiullah Khan was appointed as the secretary of the sub-committee of the proposed school. Members of the committee toured the country in order to raise funds for the school, which was finally established on 24 May 1875 in Aligarh as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental Collegiate School. Two years later, in 1877, the school was converted into the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. He retired from his career as a jurist the following year, concentrating entirely on developing the college and on religious reform. Sir Syed&#x27;s pioneering work received support from the British. Although intensely criticised by orthodox religious leaders hostile to modern influences, Sir Syed&#x27;s new institution attracted a large student body, mainly drawn from the Muslim gentry and middle classes. However, MAO College was open to all communities, and had a sizeable number of Hindu students. The first graduate of the college was a Hindu. The curriculum at the college involved scientific and Western subjects, as well as Oriental subjects and religious education. The first chancellor was Sultan Shah Jahan Begum, a prominent Muslim noblewoman, and Sir Syed invited an Englishman, Theodore Beck, to serve as the first college principal. The college was originally affiliated with Calcutta University but was transferred to the Allahabad University in 1885. Near the turn of the 20th century, it began publishing its own magazine and established a law school. In 1920, the college was transformed into Aligarh Muslim University.

===Muhammadan Educational Conference===
After founding the Anglo-Oriental College, Sir Syed felt the need of a pan-India organisation to propagate the ideas of his movement. To this cause, he established the All India Muhammadan Educational Congress with its headquarters in Aligarh. The first session of the Congress was held at Aligarh in 1886 under the presidency of Maulvi Samiullah Khan. The main objective of the organisation was to promote educational development among Muslims through conferences throughout India and transform the Anglo-Oriental College to the status of university. The name of the organisation was changed to All India Muhammadan Educational Conference to avoid confusion with the Indian National Congress.

===Opposition and criticism===
Sir Syed&#x27;s Aligarh Movement and his desire to open institutions for Western education was opposed by the orthodox Indian Muslims. Imdad Ali, the then deputy collector of Kanpur condemned the foundation of Anglo-Oriental College. Several periodicals such as &quot;Noor-ul-Afaq&quot;, &quot;Noor-ul-Anwar&quot;, and &quot;Taed-ul-Islam&quot; were started by his opponents in opposition to &quot;Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq&quot; to dissuade Muslims from joining the Aligarh Movement. Many other orthodox Islamic schools condemned him as out of the fold of Islam (i.e. a &quot;kafir&quot;). According to J.M.S. Baljon his ideas created &quot;a real hurricane of protests and outbursts of wrath&quot; among the local clerics &quot;in every town and village&quot; in Muslim India, who issued fatawa &quot;declaring him to be a &quot;kafir&quot;&quot; (unbeliever). He was also accused of having converted to Christianity. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement criticised some of his writings in a polemic titled &quot;Barakat al Dua&quot;. Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, the Pan-Islamic ideologue, launched a vitriolic attack on him through his periodical calling him a “Naturist”.

Many of his own friends, like Nawab Muhsin ul Mulk, expressed their significant reservations at his religious ideas (many of which were expounded in his commentary of Qur&#x27;an). Syed Ahmad Khan&#x27;s controversial views such as his rejection of miracles, denial of the existence of angels, downplaying the status of prophethood, etc. arose disdain also from orthodox adherents of Waliullahi reform trends, such as &quot;Ahl-e Hadith&quot; and Deobandis. &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; were particularly severe in their condemnation of Ahmad Khan; with many of its leaders like Muḥammad Ḥusayn Baṭālvī (d. 1920 C.E/ 1338 A.H) declaring &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunication) of Sir Syed as an apostate.

Maulana Qasim Nanautawi, the founder of Darul Uloom Deoband, expressed in a letter to an acquaintance of his and Sir Syed&#x27;s:

&quot;No doubt, I greatly admire, as per what I&#x27;ve heard, Syed (Ahmad) Sahab&#x27;s courage (&quot;Ūlul Azmi&quot;) and concern for the Muslims (&quot;Dardmandi e Ahl e Islam&quot;). For this if I shall express my affection for him, it will be rightful. However, similar to this (or rather more than this), upon hearing about his disturbed (Fāsid) beliefs, I have deep complaints and sorrow for him&quot;

Maulana Qasim Nanautawi wrote directly to Sir Syed as well, explaining him some of his &quot;noteworthy&quot; mistakes. This correspondence was published as &quot;Tasfiyat ul Aqaaid&quot; in 1887 C.E

==Political thoughts and activities==
Shan Muhammad in his book &quot;Sir Syed Ahmad Khan: a political biography&quot; notes that Sir Syed was foremost an educationist and reformer and not an academic thinker, and so his political philosophy is related to the circumstances of his times. Important events that shaped his political outlook includes the 1857 Rebellion, the premiership of William Ewart Gladstone in England (which started in 1868) and the viceroyalty of Ripon in India.

Sir Syed was deeply religious. His political views were centered on Islam and an Islamic viewpoint.

In 1878, Sir Syed was nominated to the Viceroy&#x27;s Legislative Council. He testified before the education commission to promote the establishment of more colleges and schools across India. At the start of his political career, Sir Syed was an advocate of Hindu–Muslim unity and India&#x27;s composite culture, wanting to empower all Indians. In the same year, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Association to promote political co-operation amongst Indian Muslims from different parts of the country. In 1886, he organised the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in Aligarh, which promoted his vision of modern education and political unity for Muslims. His works made him the most prominent Muslim politician in 19th century India, often influencing the attitude of Muslims on various national issues.

===Opposition to active politics===
Sir Syed discouraged the active involvement of Muslims in politics. He regarded the attainment of higher English education, not political pursuits, as the first priority for the upliftmeant of the Muslim community. He declined to lend support to the National Muhammadan Association, a political organisation founded by Syed Ameer Ali in 1887 and refused to participate in the Muhammedan National Conference at Lahore which he regarded as a political agitation.

When the Indian National Congress was established in 1885 he did not express any opinion about it but later he became an active critic of the organisation and expressed his active opposition to the Congress.

Sir Syed&#x27;s opposition received criticism from Maulvi Sharaf-ul-Haqq who criticised his views about the Congress demands in a risala titled &quot;Kalam Mufid-al-Anam&quot;. Lala Lajpat Rai wrote a series of open letters expressing grief and surprise at his change in attitude towards Congress.

Sir Syed advocated the use of constitutional machinery, such as participation in administration, for expressing grievances to the British government. 
He supported the efforts of Indian political leaders Surendranath Banerjee and Dadabhai Naoroji to obtain representation for Indians in the government and civil services. In 1883, he founded the Muhammadan Civil Service Fund Association to encourage and support the entry of Muslim graduates into the Indian Civil Service (ICS). In 1883, he established the Muhammedan Association to put forward grievances of the Muslims to the Imperial Legislative Council. He was nominated as a member of the Civil Service Commission in 1887 by Lord Dufferin. In 1888, he along with Raja Shiv Prasad of Benaras established the United Patriotic Association at Aligarh to promote political co-operation with the British and Muslim participation in the British government.

===Hindu–Muslim unity===
At the start of his career, Syed Ahmad Khan advocated for Hindu–Muslim unity in Colonial India. He stated: &quot;India is a beautiful bride and Hindus and Muslims are her two eyes. If one of them is lost, this beautiful bride will become ugly.&quot; Being raised in the diverse city of Delhi, Syed Ahmad Khan was exposed to the festivals of both Hindus and Muslims. He collected Hindu scriptures and &quot;had a commitment to the country&#x27;s composite culture&quot;, being close friends with Swami Vivekanand to Debendranath Tagore. In the 19th century, he opposed cow slaughter, even stopping a fellow Muslim from sacrificing one for Eid al-Adha to promote peace between Muslims and Hindus. Addressing a large gathering in Gurdaspur on 27 January 1884, Sir Syed said:

When he founded Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, he opened its admissions to Indians of all faiths, with its first principal Henry Siddons being a Christian and one of its patrons Mahendra Singh of Patiala being a Sikh. Shafey Kidwai notes that Sir Syed promoted &quot;advocacy of the empowerment of all Indians&quot;.

In his book &quot;Causes of the Indian Revolt&quot;, which was originally published in Urdu in 1858, he referred to Hindus and Muslims as &#x27;two antagonistic races&#x27; when highlighting the British folly of bringing them together in a single unit, thereby endangering the British position.

===Advocacy of Urdu===

The onset of the Hindi–Urdu controversy of 1867 saw the emergence of Sir Syed as a champion for the cause of the Urdu language. He became a leading Muslim voice opposing the adoption of Hindi as a second official language of the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh). Sir Syed perceived Urdu as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the United Provinces which was created as a confluence of Muslim and Hindu contributions in India. Having been developed during the Mughal period, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that &quot;Urdu was the language of gentry and Hindi that of the vulgar.&quot; His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi.

The success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred around and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues such as Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq developed organisations such as the Urdu Defence Association and the Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu, committed to the perpetuation of Urdu. All these colleagues led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the Hyderabad State and as the medium of instruction in the Osmania University. To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.

===Two-nation theory===
Sir Syed is considered as the first person to theorize the idea of separate nationhood for Muslims in subcontinent. In a speech at Meerut in 1888 he presented on overall scenario of post colonial phase in which he described Muslims and Hindus as two nations. He&#x27;s regarded as the father of two-nation theory and the pioneer of Muslim nationalism which led to the partition of India.

Urdu-Hindi controversy is seen as the transformation of Sir Syed&#x27;s views towards Muslim nationhood which he expressed in his speeches during later days. While fearful of the loss of Muslim political power owing to the community&#x27;s backwardness, Sir Syed was also averse to the prospect of democratic self-government, which would give control of government to the Hindu-majority population.
&quot;At this time our nation is in a bad state in regards education and wealth, but God has given us the light of religion and the Quran is present for our guidance, which has ordained them and us to be friends. Now God has made them rulers over us. Therefore we should cultivate friendship with them, and should adopt that method by which their rule may remain permanent and firm in India, and may not pass into the hands of the Bengalis... If we join the political movement of the Bengalis our nation will reap a loss, for we do not want to become subjects of the Hindus instead of the subjects of the &quot;people of the Book...&quot;
Later in his life he said:
 &quot;Suppose that the English community and the army were to leave India, taking with them all their cannons and their splendid weapons and all else, who then would be the rulers of India?...
Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations — the Mohammedans and the Hindus — could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. But until one nation has conquered the other and made it obedient, peace cannot reign in the land.&quot;

==Personal life==

In 1836, he married Parsa Begum, alias Mubarak Begum. They had two sons, Syed Hamid and Syed Mahmood, and a daughter, Ameena, who died at a young age.

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan lived the last two decades of his life in Aligarh, regarded widely as the mentor of 19th and 20th century Muslim entrepreneurs. Battling illnesses and old age, Sir Syed died on 27 March 1898. He was buried in Sir Syed Masjid at the campus of Aligarh Muslim University.

==Legacy and influence==

Syed Ahmad is widely commemorated across South Asia as a great Muslim social reformer and visionary. His educational model and progressive thinking inspired Muslim elites who supported the All India Muslim League. He founded the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in 1886 in order to promote Western education, especially science and literature, among India&#x27;s Muslims. The conference, in addition to generating funds for Ahmad Khan&#x27;s Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, motivated Muslim elites to propose expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the Aligarh Movement. In turn, this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites, who went on to form the AIML, which led Muslims of India towards the formation of Pakistan.

He was an influence on several political leaders, thinkers and writers such as Muhammad Iqbal, Abul Kalam Azad, Sayyid Mumtaz Ali Altaf Hussain Hali, Shibli Nomani, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk, Chiragh Ali, and Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi.

The university he founded remains one of India&#x27;s most prominent institutions and served as the arsenal of Muslim India. Prominent alumni of Aligarh include Muslim political leaders Maulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar, Abdur Rab Nishtar, Maulana Shaukat Ali and Maulvi Abdul Haq. The first two Prime Ministers of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan and Khawaja Nazimuddin, as well as Indian President Dr. Zakir Husain, are amongst Aligarh&#x27;s most famous graduates. His birth anniversary is celebrated as Sir Syed Day every year by the university and its alumni.

Several educational institutions in India and Pakistan such as Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology, Sir Syed CASE Institute of Technology and Sir Syed College, Taliparamba are named after him.

== Honours ==
On 2 June 1869, Syed Ahmad Khan was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI), for his service as Principal &quot;Sadr Amin&quot;. He was appointed a fellow of the Calcutta and Allahabad Universities by the Viceroy in the years 1876 and 1887 respectively.

Syed Ahmad was later bestowed with the suffix of &#x27;Khan Bahadur&#x27; and was subsequently knighted by the British government in the 1888 New Year Honours as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI). for his loyalty to the British crown, through his membership of the Imperial Legislative Council and in the following year he received an LL.D. &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the Edinburgh University.

India Post issued commemorative postage stamps in his honour in 1973 and 1998.

Pakistan Postal Services also issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honour in 1990 in its &#x27;Pioneers of Freedom&#x27; series.

In 1997, Syed Ahmad Khan was commemorated with an English Heritage blue plaque at 21 Mecklenburgh Square in Bloomsbury, where he lived in 1869–70.

On 2017, commemorative Rs. 50 coin featuring Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was issued by State Bank of Pakistan on his 200th birth anniversary.

On 14 August 2022, marking the diamond jubilee celebrations of Pakistan&#x27;s independence, State Bank of Pakistan issued a commemorative Rs.75 note featuring Syed Ahmed Khan along with other founding fathers signifying their struggle for country&#x27;s independence.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Sir Syed Ahmad Khan: The Messiah&quot; an Urdu-language biographical film, that is based on based on the life of Khan was released in 2024 and streamed on Apple TV.

<text>Whiteclay (; &quot;whiteish or yellowish clay&quot;) is a census-designated place in Sheridan County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 10 at the 2010 census.

A significant part of Whiteclay&#x27;s economy was based on alcohol sales to residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, located north across the border in South Dakota, where alcohol consumption and possession is prohibited. According to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, beer sales at Whiteclay&#x27;s four liquor stores totalled 4.9 million cans in 2010 (~13,000 cans per day) for gross sales of $3 million. The four beer merchants paid federal and state excise taxes (included in liquor&#x27;s sale price) of $413,932 that year. In 2017 the four liquor stores lost their licenses, and the town has ceased to be the main supplier of alcohol to the reservation.

==History==
The border town of Whiteclay has always been tied to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the north within the state boundaries of South Dakota. The majority of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) live at Pine Ridge reservation. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe (Sicangu Oyate), also known as the Brulé Sioux, have an independent and federally recognized reservation to the northeast within the boundaries of South Dakota.

In 1882, after the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were already established, by executive order the United States government added a strip of land in Nebraska known as the White Clay Extension (named after White Clay Creek) to the reservation. The area was created to serve as a buffer zone to help prevent the sale of alcohol to residents of the reservation. The language of the order said that the buffer zone would be used until it was no longer considered necessary.

In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order that removed 49 of the of the White Clay Extension from the reservation. There was no consultation with the Oglala Sioux Tribe as to whether they believed this was useful. Traders immediately established a post near the reservation border and started selling alcohol, and most of their customers came from the nearby reservation. The trading post developed as the unincorporated community of Pine Ridge, commonly known as Whiteclay. It reached its peak population of 104 in 1940, but its population has declined for decades since.

Some Oglala Sioux have appealed to the federal government for another executive order to withdraw the buffer from public domain. They contend that because Roosevelt never demonstrated that the need for the buffer did not exist, the executive order was invalid. Even if such action were achieved, it could always be subject to reversal by another president.

Separately, in a 1999 protest against beer sales at Whiteclay, nine Oglala Sioux led by Tom Poor Bear were arrested. They challenged their arrests by Nebraska officials, on the grounds that, according to the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty and subsequent federal law, the White Clay Extension is still under the jurisdiction of the Pine Ridge reservation, where alcohol sales are prohibited. The Oglala Sioux Tribal Court ruled in the defendants&#x27; favor. In February 2000, the Sheridan County, Nebraska court ruled that the defendants could be charged under local law, as Whiteclay and the border territory were part of the state of Nebraska. A final ruling on the jurisdictional issue could only be made in federal court, as Congress has the authority to establish reservation boundaries.

==Economy==
Soon after the territory entered the public domain, a trading post was set up to sell alcohol to the Lakota, and merchants have continued to do so since. In 2010, its four beer stores sold an estimated 4.9 million 12-ounce cans of beer, an average of over 13,000 cans per day, for gross sales of 3 million dollars. The outlets provide no place on site for customers to consume beer, and it is not supposed to be drunk on the streets, but inebriated customers were often sprawled around Whiteclay. John Yellow Bird King, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, says that tribal members bring alcohol illegally back from Whiteclay and &quot;90 percent of criminal cases in the court system&quot; at the reservation are alcohol-related. Beer was sold almost exclusively to people from the reservation, as the nearest big city (and other customers) is two hours to the north. According to Mary Frances Berry, the 10-year chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Whiteclay can be said to exist only to sell beer to the Oglala Lakota.

Victor Clarke, the owner of Arrowhead Foods, a grocery store in Whiteclay that does not sell alcohol, said he &quot;did more than a million dollars in business last year, with an entirely Native American clientele.&quot; As the reservation has no banks and few stores, its residents spend most of their money in Nebraska border towns, for regular needs as well as alcohol. The beer stores in Whiteclay cash welfare and tax refund checks for the Oglala Lakota, taking a 3 percent commission.

===Activism against beer sales===
Prior to 2017, the status of Whiteclay&#x27;s beer stores was a constant political issue in the region, prompting waves of activism to end the alcohol sales. There were problems of public drunkenness in Whiteclay, and violence was associated with alcohol there and on the reservation. A 2000 report stated that tribal police estimated issuing more than 1,000 DUIs annually on the two-mile stretch of road between White Clay and Pine Ridge. Victor Clarke, a grocery store owner in the hamlet, noted that numerous places within an hour&#x27;s drive could supply beer if Whiteclay were shut down, saying &quot;The state of Nebraska doesn&#x27;t want Whiteclay to go away because it allows problems to be isolated in this one little place. You hear people in the towns around here saying, &#x27;We don&#x27;t want these guys in our town.&#x27;&quot;

In 2010, the liquor stores paid federal and state excise taxes (included in liquor&#x27;s sale price) of $413,932, according to the state liquor commission, mostly from sales to residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Some activists have supported the legalization of alcohol sales on the reservation so that the tribe can keep the revenues. These would support building a treatment center and founding more programs, and the tribe could directly regulate and control the sales, as other tribes have done. (See discussion below).

A pair of unsolved murders of Lakota men in early 1999 led to protest rallies led by various activist groups, including members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Nebraskans for Peace, demanding that Nebraska revoke the liquor licenses of Whiteclay&#x27;s stores and increase law enforcement in the area. The nearest Nebraska-based law enforcement is the county sheriff&#x27;s office, based in the county seat of Rushville to the south. The Sioux tribal law enforcement in Pine Ridge, South Dakota has no jurisdiction in Whiteclay, and the number of tribal police has been reduced by nearly two thirds over the past several years. In the fall of 1999, Native American activists Russell Means and Frank LaMere proposed getting a license to sell beer in Whiteclay, in order to retain some monies to benefit the tribe and build a treatment center on the reservation, but abandoned the project due to disagreement by others of their group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendee/Hammel&quot;&gt;David Hendee and Paul Hammel, &quot;Whiteclay Beer Proposal Divides Indian Leaders&quot;, &quot;Omaha World-Herald,&quot; 6 October 1999, accessed 6 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the state of Nebraska and President Cecilia Fire Thunder of the Pine Ridge reservation signed an agreement to allow Oglala tribal officers to enforce Nebraska laws in Whiteclay by deputizing them as Nebraska agents. The OST Tribal Council had approved the agreement in June 2005 in a meeting with Nebraska officials, the State Attorney General Jon Bruning and Congressman Tom Osborne. With lobbying by Nebraska&#x27;s delegation, Congress earmarked $200,000 over two years to pay for the increased cost of additional tribal police personnel and other costs of OST patrols to be associated with Whiteclay.

But, by May 2007, the tribe had spent no money for this purpose. Fire Thunder was impeached several months before the end of her term in 2006. The political conflict within the tribe appeared to have resulted in its choosing not to implement the agreement; by May 2007, it had hired no new police nor organized to take advantage of the grant. It stood to lose the earmarked money by October 2007.

Tribal activists of the Strong Heart Society have conducted annual blockades since 1999, trying to intercept alcohol and drugs being brought into the reservation. For instance, in June 2006 tribal activists had protested the beer sales by blockading the road to confiscate beer bought in Whiteclay. The blockade was to be held within the reservation boundaries. The activists had lifted the blockade after agreeing to work with Chief of OST Police James Twiss on ways to limit bootlegging. According to Twiss, the roadblock was illegal; however, the police department lacked the money and manpower to do more to interdict bootlegging from Whiteclay to the reservation.

In May 2007, activists discussed another blockade after some bootleggers were successfully prosecuted by the US Attorney for South Dakota. Two women were sentenced in the case. At the same time, it appeared that by the fall of 2007, the OST would lose $200,000 in federal grants that would have enabled it to hire more police and have them deputized by Nebraska to help police Whiteclay and protect their people. Tribal officials did not talk to reporters when questioned about the lack of action. Mark Vasina of Nebraskans for Peace, who had collaborated with the tribe in protests, said that there was internal tribal conflict over the proposed deputization program. He thought the agreement represented a commitment by Nebraska officials to take action but it &quot;shuns the state&#x27;s responsibility&quot; for the effects of the beer sales. Vasina&#x27;s documentary about the issues and activism was released in 2008 as &quot;The Battle for Whiteclay&quot;.

In 2010, the Nebraska legislature passed a law to provide money for increased law enforcement and economic development in Whiteclay; in December 2010, it awarded a $10,000 grant to Sheridan County, to cover the increased costs for its sheriff&#x27;s office to patrol Whiteclay, 22 miles north of the county seat. There was the potential for funds to be increased in following years.

Protests continued. In 2013, protesters including then-president of the Oglala tribe, Bryan Brewer, and activist Debra White Plume stopped beer trucks from entering the town.

===Alternatives===
A 2007 survey found that 63% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states have legalized liquor sales on their reservations, enabling them to keep the considerable sales taxes and associated revenue generated, regulate the trade, and directly police and treat their own people in relation to this commodity. Those allowing alcohol sales include all the other reservations in South Dakota, such as the Sicangu Oyate or Brulé Sioux at the Rosebud Indian Reservation to the east.

The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska is among those that have legalized alcohol sales. As another example, in 2006, the Omaha Nation in northeastern Nebraska started requiring payment of tribal license fees and sales taxes by liquor stores located in towns within its reservation boundaries in order to benefit in the alcohol revenues. James N Hughes III suggests that the Oglala Sioux Tribe at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation could &quot;regulate, police and profit from the sale of what has been, for 200 years, an irresistible liquid commodity.&quot; Rather than supporting white traders, the tribe could keep its money within the reservation and directly control and police the alcohol trade.

In 2010 the beer sales at Whiteclay generated $413,932 in federal and state taxes, according to the state liquor commission. Hughes suggests that a &quot;legalized liquor trade could provide the tribe with its own product upon which to levy tribal taxes and generate much needed revenue to fund healthcare services on Pine Ridge,&quot; including building a detoxification facility. In addition, proper taxation strategy by the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation could be used to eliminate Whiteclay&#x27;s stores from the marketplace and &quot;turn a social poison into an economic boon.&quot; The tribe could regulate operations of liquor stores, such as hours, and better police selling to underage consumers. In 2004 the tribe voted down a referendum to legalize alcohol sales, and in 2006 the tribal council voted to maintain the ban on alcohol sales.

In the summer of 2010, Denver American Horse, a teacher of the Lakota language, announced as a candidate for president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. He proposed changing the reservation rules to permit alcohol sales. According to the journalist Mary Garrigan, he said that the &quot;additional taxes that now go off-reservation could be used to fund much-needed alcohol treatment programs.&quot; As reported by Timothy Williams, Milton Bians, a tribal police captain, also supports ending prohibition. &quot;Not to disrespect our elders and grandparents, but we&#x27;ve gone through several generations,&quot; he said.

Victor Clarke, the manager of a grocery store in Whiteclay, supports the idea of the tribe&#x27;s ending its prohibition against alcohol sales. He thinks it would be the &quot;biggest economic boon they could do.&quot; The tribe would then have both the benefits and responsibility of alcohol sales.

===&quot;Oglala Sioux Tribe v. Jason Schwarting, et al&quot;===
On February 9, 2012, the Oglala Sioux Tribe filed a federal lawsuit against Whiteclay&#x27;s liquor stores, as well as national beer distributors and manufacturers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors Brewing Company, Pabst Brewing Company, and Miller Brewing Company. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants knowingly sold and distributed beer with the intent of consumption on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where alcohol is banned and alcohol-related problems are rampant.

According to the suit:

The illegal sale and trade in alcohol in Whiteclay is open, notorious and well documented by news reports, legislative hearings, movies, public protests and law enforcement activities. All of the above have resulted in the publication of the facts of the illegal trade in alcohol and its devastating effects on the Lakota people, especially its children, both born and unborn.

The OST is seeking $500 million in damages for reimbursement of the &quot;cost of health care, social services and child rehabilitation caused by chronic alcoholism on the reservation, which encompasses some of the nation&#x27;s most impoverished counties.&quot; The tribe is represented in the suit by Tom White, the tribe&#x27;s Omaha-based attorney. As White said, &quot;In a town of 11 people selling 4.9 million 12-ounce servings of beer, there is no way that alcohol could be legally consumed. It&#x27;s just impossible.&quot;

On February 22, 2012, an amended complaint seeking injunctive relief in the OST&#x27;s lawsuit was filed in response to public comments made to the Nebraska Radio Network on February 10, 2012, by the Nebraska State Attorney General Jon Bruning, the highest law enforcement officer in the state. According to the amended complaint, it is &quot;not reasonable to expect that in the future the State of Nebraska will enforce its laws regulating the sale of alcohol at Whiteclay.&quot; Bruning had said he believed the State of Nebraska should not be involved in the suit; that shutting down the beer stores wasn&#x27;t the solution; that reservation residents would drive further afield to purchase alcohol, which might lead to increased drunk driving; and that any money recovered in damages by the OST, in this suit or others, might be used to buy alcohol.

Federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1161) prohibits the sale and distribution of alcohol on reservations unless allowed by the tribal government. Charles Abourezk, a Rapid City lawyer, said the Whiteclay lawsuit challenges the defendants&#x27; &quot;intent to distribute on a dry reservation, contrary to federal and tribal law.&quot;

On October 1, 2012, the U.S. District Judge John M. Gerrard dismissed the Oglala Sioux Tribe&#x27;s lawsuit against the beer stores and associated companies, saying that the federal court did not have jurisdiction over the issue. He dismissed it &quot;without prejudice, meaning the tribe could take its claims to state court.&quot; The judge acknowledged that beer sales contributed to problems on the reservation.

===Nebraska state response===
As noted, the Nebraska legislature created bills to increase funding for police protection and health services in the area. In February 2012 Nebraska lawmakers were

considering legislation that would allow the state to limit the types of alcohol sold in areas like Whiteclay. The measure would require local authorities to ask the state to designate the area an &#x27;alcohol impact zone.&#x27; Under the legislation, the state liquor commission would be authorized to &quot;limit the hours alcohol sellers are open, ban the sale of certain products or impose other restrictions.&quot;

The measure was introduced by Nebraska state Senator LeRoy J. Louden of Ellsworth, whose district includes Whiteclay. Sheridan County officials support it.

===Liquor license renewals denied===
In April 2017, the three-member Nebraska Liquor Control Commission voted to deny license renewals to the four liquor stores in Whiteclay, citing inadequate law enforcement in the area. The stores were allowed to continue selling beer until the existing licenses expired at midnight April 30, 2017. The store owners appealed the decision to the Nebraska Supreme Court, but their appeal was denied. Since then, the town has cleaned up, with fewer vagrants; however, bootlegging continues on the reservation and many now travel to other Nebraska towns like Rushville.

==Geography==
For the 2000 Census, the CDP for Whiteclay was erroneously named &#x27;Pine Ridge&#x27;. The name has been corrected to &#x27;Whiteclay&#x27; in 2010 for all subsequent census products and reports. A small portion of the Pine Ridge reservation overlaps with the Whiteclay CDP in Nebraska. According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place (CDP) known as &quot;Whiteclay, Nebraska&quot; has a total area of , of which 0.9 square mile (2.3 km) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km) (8.33%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 14 people, seven households, and three families residing in the CDP. The population density was 15.8 people per square mile (6.1/km). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 10.1/sq mi (3.9/km). The racial makeup of the CDP was 64.29% Native American and 35.71% White.

There were seven households, out of which 14.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.9% were married couples living together, and 57.1% were non-families. 57.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.00 and the average family size was 3.33.

In the CDP, 21.4% of the population was under the age of 18, 7.1% was from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 35.7% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 75.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $61,250, and the median income for a family was $76,250. Males had a median income of $25,625 versus $53,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $21,394. None of the population or the families were below the poverty line.
