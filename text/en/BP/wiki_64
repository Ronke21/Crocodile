<text>Southern Methodist University (SMU) is a private research university in University Park, Texas, United States, with a satellite campus in Taos County, New Mexico. SMU was founded on April 17, 1911, by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South—now part of the United Methodist Church—in partnership with Dallas civic leaders. However, it is non-sectarian in its teaching and enrolls students of all religious affiliations. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

As of fall 2022, the university had over 12,000 students, including approximately 7,000 undergraduates and 5,000 postgraduates. As of fall 2019, its instructional faculty is 1,151, with 754 being full-time.

In the 2020 academic year, the university granted over 3,827 degrees, including 315 doctorates, 1,659 master&#x27;s and 1,853 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and offers over 32 doctoral and over 120 masters programs from eight schools: the Edwin L. Cox School of Business, the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, the Dedman School of Law, the Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering, the Algur H. Meadows School of the Arts, the Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, Perkins School of Theology, and the Annette Caldwell Simmons School of Education and Human Development.

== History ==
The university was chartered on April 17, 1911, by the southern denomination of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At the time of the charter, church leaders saw a need to establish a Methodist institution within a metropolitan area. Originally, this new institution was intended to be created in Fort Worth through a merger between Polytechnic College (now Texas Wesleyan University) and Southwestern University. However, the church&#x27;s education commission instead opted to create a new institution in Dallas to serve this purpose after extensive lobbying by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. Robert Stewart Hyer, previously president of Southwestern University, was appointed as the first president of the new university.

The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the General Conference of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new connectional institution in the wake of a 1914 Tennessee Supreme Court decision stripping the church of authority at Vanderbilt University. The church decided to support the establishment of the new institution while also increasing the size of Emory University at a new location in DeKalb County, Georgia. At the 1914 meeting of the General Conference, Southern Methodist University was designated the connectional institution for all conferences west of the Mississippi River.

SMU named its first building Dallas Hall in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university&#x27;s location. It remains the university&#x27;s symbol and centerpiece, and it inspired &quot;the Hilltop&quot; as a nickname for the school. It was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge after the Rotunda at the University of Virginia. Dallas Hall opened its doors in 1915 and housed the entire university along with a bank and a barbershop. The hall is registered in the National Register of Historic Places.

Classes were planned to officially begin in 1913, but construction delays on the university&#x27;s first building prevented classes from starting until 1915. In the interim, the only functioning academic department at SMU was the medical college it had acquired from Southwestern University.

As the first president of Southern Methodist University, Hyer selected Harvard crimson and Yale blue as the school colors in order to associate SMU with the high standards of Ivy League universities. Several streets in University Park and adjacent Highland Park were named after prominent universities.

In 1927, Highland Park United Methodist Church, designed by architects Mark Lemmon and Roscoe DeWitt, was erected on campus.

During World War II, SMU was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In 1987, the university football program&#x27;s repeated, flagrant recruiting violations led to the NCAA administering what is called the death penalty against the program. The punishment included cancellation of the 1987 football season, most of the 1988 season, and a two-year ban from Bowl Games and televised sports coverage.

On February 22, 2008, the university trustees unanimously instructed President R. Gerald Turner to enter into an agreement to establish the George W. Bush Presidential Center on 23 acres on the southeast side of the campus. The center, which includes a presidential library, museum, institute, and the offices of the George W. Bush Foundation, was dedicated on April 25, 2013, in a ceremony which featured all living former U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and then-incumbent U.S. president, Barack Obama.

The library and museum are privately administered by the National Archives and Records Administration, while the university holds representation on the independent public policy institute board. The project raised over $500 million for the construction and endowment of the George W. Bush presidential center, which has a 249-year ground lease from SMU, with extensions, and operates completely separate from SMU.

===Split from the United Methodist Church===
In light of the turmoil within the Methodist Church over what it described as &quot;fundamental differences&quot; over LGBTQ policies, the university decided to separate itself from control of the church.

In November 2019, the SMU board filed with the state of Texas amended articles of incorporation that eliminated the United Methodist Church&#x27;s rights as listed in the 1996 articles. The amendment made it clear that SMU is solely maintained and controlled by its Board as the ultimate authority for the university and removed an overarching statement that the school would be &quot;owned, maintained and controlled by the South Central Jurisdictional Conference.&quot; Within a month, the Church filed a lawsuit alleging that the trustees of SMU have no authority to amend the Articles of Incorporation without the prior approval and authorization of SCJC. In March 2021, Dallas County judge ruled in favor of Southern Methodist University in the lawsuit.

=== Historical Plano campus ===
From 1997 to 2020 Southern Methodist University operated a small campus, consisting of 16 acres and 4 buildings, in Plano, Texas, in Legacy Business Park. This campus hosted SMU&#x27;s video game design school, SMU Guildhall, and other graduate-level programs. After the university sold the Plano campus to a developer in 2019, SMU Guildhall and all other programs housed there moved onto the main Dallas campus in the new Gerald J. Ford Hall for Research and Innovation on December 4, 2020.

== Organization and resources ==
=== Institutional organization ===
SMU has eight degree-granting schools each headed by a dean, with all undergraduates entering the university in the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences as pre-majors:
* Cox School of Business
* Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences
* Dedman School of Law
* Lyle School of Engineering
* Meadows School of the Arts
* Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies 
* Perkins School of Theology
* Simmons School of Education and Human Development

=== Endowment and financial resources ===
Southern Methodist University&#x27;s 2019 endowment of $1.664 billion ranked 67th largest among the endowments of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, and it was one of only 110 institutions with an endowment greater than $1 billion as of June 30, 2019.

The university&#x27;s endowment surpassed $2 billion for the first time in the university&#x27;s history in 2021, having previously surpassed $1 billion in 2005. 

On February 26, 2016, SMU announced that through its &quot;Second Century Centennial Campaign&quot; which concluded on December 31, 2015, had raised $1.15 billion, the largest fundraising campaign of any institution in North Texas&#x27;s history, the largest total for a private Texas university, and the fourth largest of any university in Texas. The Centennial Campaign, coinciding with the 100-year anniversary of the university&#x27;s founding in 1911 and opening in 1915 also made SMU one of only 34 private colleges and universities in the United States to complete a campaign of $1 billion or more. 

Its previous fundraising campaign, &quot;A Time to Lead&quot;, which concluded in April 2002 and raised $542 million was the largest fundraising campaign in the school&#x27;s history at the time. Under R. Gerald Turner&#x27;s leadership and through two successive campaigns in under 20 years, SMU has received well over $1.6 billion in commitments in support of institutional priorities.

By 1986 as the university neared the 75th anniversary of its founding, SMU&#x27;s endowment had grown from $60 million a decade earlier in 1976 to nearly $325 million, at the time the 27th largest in the country. The previous &quot;The Design for the Third Generation&quot; fundraising campaign, which concluded in May 1983 raised nearly $120 million in gifts and pledges.

== Campuses ==
=== Main campus ===
The main campus of Southern Methodist University is mostly located in University Park, a municipality in Dallas County, Texas. The campus extends into the Dallas city limits, and into the city limits of Highland Park. It is located on 234 acres of land just west of US Route 75. Dallas Hall is the centerpiece for this campus and is the administrative center for the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences.

Most of the campus is centered around Bishop Boulevard, an elongated, tree-lined loop road that also serves as the site for &quot;Boulevarding&quot;, SMU&#x27;s version of the tailgating seen on many American college campuses. The campus was ranked as the most beautiful campus in America by &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; in 2016 and also hosts the George W. Bush Presidential Center, located on the east side of the campus. The library and museum are privately administered by the National Archives and Records Administration, while the university holds representation on the institute board.

=== Taos campus ===
Since 1973, the university has owned a 423-acre campus located at Fort Burgwin, just outside of Taos, New Mexico. This campus hosts classes during intersessions between semesters and during the summer. Along with the normal academic courses offered at the site, students attending classes at this campus during the winter can opt to attend wellness classes centered around winter sports. Other courses offered at this campus are sometimes adjusted to utilize the surrounding environment, such as a course in field botany offered during some summers.

== Academics ==
=== Undergraduate admissions ===
For the class of 2024 (entering Fall 2020), 14,010 students applied, 7,379 (52.7%) were admitted, and 1,531 enrolled/matriculated (20.7%) – including 758 women and 773 men, and the 1 year retention rate (entering Fall 2019) was 92%. The average SAT was 1,343 while the average ACT was 30.6. The middle 50% SAT range for enrolled students was 630–710 for Evidence-Based Reading &amp; Writing, 620–740 for math, while the ACT Composite range was 29–33.

=== University Honors Program ===
First-year undergraduate students admitted to SMU are automatically reviewed for admissions into the highly selective University Honors Program (UHP). Generally, first-year students that rank in the top 10% of their incoming class will receive a formal invitation to join the UHP. Students that do not receive an invitation must have completed at least one full-time semester on campus with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher before formally applying for admissions. The University Honors Program is a liberal arts honors experience that serves to supplement the basic SMU University Curriculum. Students are required to take honors courses throughout their time at SMU, and the program culminates with a final senior project or experience. Each student&#x27;s experience can be unique, and students are encouraged to pursue projects in their area of study or about their passions.

=== Undergraduate housing ===

Since the autumn of 2014, Southern Methodist University&#x27;s undergraduate housing system has operated on a residential commons model rooted in similar systems at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England. Undergraduate students are required to live on campus for their first two years, and they must live their first year in one of the eleven residential commons that they are randomly sorted into after enrollment. Each commons houses a faculty-in-residence and a residential community director that organize events and interact with the residents. The eleven residential commons are Armstrong, Boaz, Cockrell-McIntosh, Crum, Kathy Crow, Loyd, Mary Hay-Peyton-Shuttles, McElvaney, Morrison-McGinnis, Virginia-Snider, and Ware. Built in 1926, Virginia-Snider Commons is the oldest of the current residence halls. It served as a women&#x27;s dormitory in the university&#x27;s early years, and it later served as the common residence hall for students in the University Honors Program before the implementation of the residential commons model. The youngest commons are those that opened in 2014: Armstrong, Kathy Crow, Ware, Loyd, and Crum.

=== Student organizations ===
Southern Methodist University is home to almost three hundred student organizations, including academic, professional, fraternal, sporting, ethnic themed, religious, service, and political diversity groups. Notable examples include the Feminist Equality Movement (FEM), the service organization Mustang Heroes, one of the largest organizations on campus, and the Embrey Human Rights Program.
Student organizations such as Student Foundation and Program Council frequently sponsor all-student events on various weekdays and weekends as well as boulevard tents. Student Foundation helps put on popular events such as Family Weekend, the Tate lectures, Celebration of Lights, Homecoming, and Perunapalooza.

=== Religious life ===
The Office of the Chaplain and Religious Life house religious organizations on campus. There are multiple Christian organizations, Hillel, and a Muslim Students Association. The South Asian Student Association hosts a Diwali celebration yearly. There is a Catholic Center on campus.

=== Student media ===
&quot;The Daily Campus&quot; was the independent student newspaper between 1915 and 2018. The frequency of the publication changed throughout the years and with the change in semesters. Publishing less frequently over the summer, for example. The board of directors of The Student Media Company, the independent nonprofit that at one time oversaw all student media, including KSMU and Rotunda, voted to dissolve due to a lack of funds in April 2018. Although still publishing in digital format, the newspaper lost its independent status in May 2018.

Other student media include:
* &quot;The Rotunda&quot;, the official SMU yearbook
* SMU-TV, a student-run television station serving the Park Cities community
* &quot;The Daily Update&quot;, a weekday morning newscast that airs on SMU-TV and smudailymustang.com
* &quot;Hilltopics&quot;, a publication sponsored by the University Honors Program that publishes periodically
* &quot;The Muddler&quot;, a satirical newspaper
* &quot;SMU LOOK&quot;, a student-run fashion magazine, website, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube channel
* &quot;SMU Style&quot;, a student-run fashion and lifestyle blog

As of May 2018, &quot;The Daily Campus&quot; was placed under the control of the school&#x27;s journalism department.

KSMU, a student-radio station, operated from 1964 to 1989. It broadcast as a carrier-current and FM station; in the 1980s, it was restricted to broadcasting within the student center and via local cable. The call letters were changed to KPNI, which operated from 1995 to 2011. In the latter days, it was a digital streaming station and moved from management under the auspices of the Student Media Co. to the department of journalism. The university radio station was shuttered in 2011 due to a lack of funding.

=== Greek life ===
Southern Methodist University has approximately 43% of its undergraduate student body affiliated with its Greek system.

Starting in 2010, the NPC sororities began updating and rebuilding their older sorority houses. The multi-million dollar projects was received critically by some, praised by others. The first house rebuilt was Pi Beta Phi, followed by Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, Chi Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta, Alpha Chi Omega.

SMU has a zero tolerance stance against hazing and has suspended organizations for violations. Alpha Phi Alpha was suspended in 2004 due to hazing rituals during which a student went into a coma; four members of the fraternity were expelled from SMU as a result. In 2018, Phi Gamma Delta was ordered to cease all organizational activity pending a university investigation into hazing. Pi Kappa Alpha received a similar notice that year. On March 26, 2018, Pi Kappa Alpha was officially suspended by the university until the fall of 2022. This was the second suspension of a Greek Life organization in the 2017–2018 academic year after Kappa Alpha Order was suspended in October 2017. 

Kappa Alpha Theta was suspended in 2022 and entered a mutual agreement with SMU through May 2025, after allegations of hazing new members. New members were pressured to consume large amounts of alcohol on February 10, 2022, and were exposed to other activities that endangered their safety and mental health. After Kappa Alpha Theta&#x27;s suspension, members established the 501(c)(3) nonprofit, The Society. The Society recruits new members, has a house (off-campus), and participates in mixers with fraternities, just as Kappa Alpha Theta did. SMU added a provision to its Student Code of Conduct, warning of disciplinary action towards students who affiliate with unrecognized student organizations, such as The Society. 

=== Athletics===
Southern Methodist University&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Mustangs and participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I, with the football team competing as a member of Division I FBS. The football team plays at Gerald J. Ford Stadium on the SMU campus. The Mustangs compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) as of the 2024-25 season. Prior to that, the Mustangs played in the American Athletic Conference (previously named the Big East Conference), the now-defunct Southwest Conference, and the Western Athletic Conference. 

SMU&#x27;s closest rival in athletics is Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas. In football, SMU and TCU compete annually (with the exception of 2006) for the Iron Skillet. SMU also competes annually with Rice University in football for the Mayor&#x27;s Cup, a traveling trophy that has been created to enhance the Rice-SMU rivalry, which dates back to 1916.

From 1980 to 1985, SMU had one of the strongest programs in Division I-A (now FBS). They posted a record of 55–14–1, and finished these seasons ranked No. 21, No. 7, No. 2, No. 19, and No. 8 in the nation. These &quot;winningest&quot; years concluded with on February 25, 1987, due to repeated violations conducted by boosters. The NCAA administered the &quot;death penalty&quot; for repeated, flagrant recruiting violations. Components included cancellation of the entire 1987 season, a two-year ban from bowl appearances, a two-year ban from television appearances, a limit of seven games, all on road, in the 1988 season, a loss of three assistant coaching positions for two years and a loss of 55 new scholarships over four years. Players were allowed to transfer without sitting out one season, per standard requirement. SMU responded to the combination of these conditions by canceling the 1988 season outright.

=== Marching Band ===

SMU&#x27;s marching band plays at football and basketball games, performing big band and jazz music. The approximately 80-member ensemble is nicknamed &quot;The Best Dressed Band in the Land&quot; due to its variety of uniform combinations. In 2001, the band performed at the first inauguration of George W. Bush.

<text>Hans Wilhelm Schlegel (Überlingen, 3 August 1951) is a German physicist, a former ESA astronaut, and a veteran of two NASA Space Shuttle missions.

==Early life and education==

Schlegel, born and raised in Germany, graduated as an international exchange student from Lewis Central High School in Council Bluffs, Iowa and Hansa Gymnasium in Cologne before studying physics at RWTH Aachen University in his home country. After having received his university degree, he conducted research in semiconductor physics before being trained as an astronaut in the late 1980s by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). He flew as a DLR payload specialist in 1993 aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-55, which included the German-sponsored Spacelab D-2 research module.

==ESA career==

From 1995 to 1997, he trained as the backup crew member for the German-Russian Mir&#x27;97 mission, and afterwards received additional training in Russia to become qualified as a second board engineer for the Mir space station. In 1998, he became a member of the European Astronaut Corps.

Schlegel was a mission specialist on the STS-122 Space Shuttle mission. The mission was charged with carrying the Columbus laboratory into orbit and connecting it to the International Space Station.
Hans was to perform a spacewalk on the first EVA (EVA1) of STS-122, on Sunday, 10 February 2008, in preparation for attaching the Columbus laboratory to the ISS. The EVA was postponed until Monday 11 February 2008 due to an undisclosed medical issue allegedly affecting Schlegel. Stanley G. Love performed the spacewalk instead of Schlegel. However, Schlegel did perform the second EVA on Wednesday 13 February 2008. During the spacewalk, he completed the replacement of the Nitrogen Tank Assembly on the P1 truss of the International Space Station, and installed trunnion covers on the Columbus module.

<text>is a Japanese engineer and an astronaut working for Axiom Space. He retired from JAXA in 2024. Wakata is a veteran of four NASA Space Shuttle missions, a Russian Soyuz mission, and a long-duration stay on the International Space Station. During a nearly two-decade career in spaceflight, he has logged more than five hundred days in space. During Expedition 39, he became the first Japanese commander of the International Space Station. Wakata flew on the Soyuz TMA-11M/Expedition 38/Expedition 39 long duration spaceflight from 7 November 2013 to 13 May 2014. During this spaceflight he was accompanied by Kirobo, the first humanoid robot astronaut.

== Career ==
Wakata was born in Ōmiya, Saitama, Japan, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1987, a Master of Science degree in Applied Mechanics in 1989, and a Doctorate in Aerospace Engineering in 2004 from Kyushu University. He worked as a structural engineer for Japan Airlines.

== JAXA career ==
Wakata was selected by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) (now JAXA) as an astronaut candidate in 1992, and trained at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center. Wakata has held a number of assignments, and during STS-85, Wakata acted as NASDA Assistant Payload Operations Director for the Manipulator Flight Demonstration, a robotic arm experiment for the Japanese Experiment Module of the International Space Station (ISS). In December 2000, he became a NASA robotics instructor astronaut. In July 2006, he served as commander of the 10th NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) mission, a seven-day undersea expedition at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Aquarius laboratory located off the coast of Florida. In August 2006, he started flight engineer training for Russian Soyuz spacecraft in preparation for a long-duration stay on the ISS.

== Spaceflight experience ==
Wakata first flew aboard STS-72 in 1996, and then returned to space on STS-92 in 2000. Wakata launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for a long-duration mission as part of Expeditions 18, 19, and 20 on STS-119 on March 15, 2009 and returned to the earth aboard Endeavour with the STS-127 crew four and a half months later on July 31, 2009. On November 7, 2013 Wataka returned to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-11M for a six-month mission covering Expeditions 38 and 39. He became the ISS commander for the last two months of that mission on Expedition 39.

=== STS-72 === 
On STS-72, Wakata became the first Japanese mission specialist. STS-72 retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan ten months earlier), deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer, and evaluated techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station.

During STS-72, Wakata and fellow astronaut Dan Barry became the first people to play the game &quot;Go&quot; in space. Wakata and Barry used a special &quot;Go&quot; set, which was named &quot;Go Space&quot;, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow.

=== STS-92 === 
Wakata became the first Japanese astronaut to work on the assembly of the International Space Station during STS-92. The crew attached the Z1 truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA3) to the station using &quot;Discovery&quot;’s robotic arm. STS-92 prepared the station for its first resident crew.

=== Expedition 18/19/20 === 
In February 2007, Wakata was assigned as a flight engineer to ISS Expedition 18, scheduled to begin in winter of 2008. He launched with the crew of STS-119 and was the first resident station crew member from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). He served as flight engineer 2 on Expedition 18, Expedition 19 and Expedition 20, before returning home as a mission specialist on STS-127.

Wakata was the first Japanese astronaut to take part in a long-duration mission on the station.

Wakata is the first person to serve on five different crews without returning to Earth: STS-119, Expedition 18, Expedition 19, Expedition 20 and STS-127.

During his time on the station, he took part in experiments suggested by the public, including flying a &quot;magic carpet&quot;, folding laundry and doing pushups.

As an experiment on the station, he wore the same special underpants for a month without washing them. Wakata returned to Earth in July 2009 aboard Endeavour with the STS-127 crew after being a flight engineer on the station. American and Canadian astronauts aboard STS-127 delivered and installed the final two components of the Japanese Experiment Module: the Exposed Facility (JEM-EF), and the Exposed Section (JEM-ES).

=== Expedition 38/39 === 
Wakata launched on Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station in November 2013. During Expedition 38 and Expedition 39, Kirobo—who had the mission to serve as a companion robot to the astronaut—worked closely with Wakata, conducting experiments in space through verbal orders from the astronaut. One of the experiments was the first-ever human-robot conversation in space. Wakata arrived on the International Space Station as part of Expedition 38 in late 2013. He became the commander of the International Space Station with Expedition 39, in March 2014. This marked the first time a Japanese astronaut became ISS station commander, and only the third time an astronaut of neither Russian nor American citizenship served as station commander. Wakata returned to Earth on May 13, 2014.

=== SpaceX Crew-5 === 
Wakata trained as backup for JAXA astronaut and SpaceX Crew-1 mission specialist Soichi Noguchi ahead of his long duration stay aboard of the ISS as part of Expedition 64. Shortly after Noguchi&#x27;s launch in November 2020, JAXA announced that Wakata would return to the ISS for another long-duration mission in 2022. On 21 May 2021 NASA announced JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata as the fourth member of the crew, in cooperation with JAXA as NASA&#x27;s international partner. In October 2021, Wakata was reassigned to the SpaceX Crew-5 flight.

=== Post-JAXA career === 
Wakata retired from JAXA at the end of March 2024. On April 8, 2024, it was announced that Wakata had joined Axiom Space as an astronaut and Chief Technical Officer for the Asia-Pacific Region.

== Personal information ==
Wakata is married to Stefanie von Sachsen-Altenburg of Bonn, Germany, and has a son. He is a multi-engine and instrument-rated pilot, and has logged over 2100 hours in a variety of aircraft.

== Honors and awards ==
Minor planet 6208 Wakata is named after him.

<doc id="479123" wikidata="Q1544631" url="?curid=479123" title="Green River (soft drink)">
<text>Green River is a bright green, lime-flavored soft drink. It was created by Richard C. Jones in Davenport, Iowa, sold widely by the Chicago-based Schoenhofen Edelweiss Brewing Company in 1919, subsequently sold by other vendors, and is currently manufactured by Sprecher Brewery.

==History==

Green River soda was first created in 1916 in Davenport, Iowa, by Richard C. Jones, who owned a local confectionary shop. In 1919, Jones sold his recipe to the Schoenhofen Edelweiss Brewing Company of Chicago. Prior to 1920, the brewery produced the popular Edelweiss beer. Schoenhofen began manufacturing Green River and other soft drinks in order to survive the Prohibition Era. It was also made by the Sweetwater Brewery in Green River, Wyoming. In 1928 Green River soda was produced by Spokane Bottling Works of Spokane, Washington, and in 1935 was of several products produced by the Everett Bottling Works of Everett, Washington, which also produced Orange Crush, Hires and Wy-an sodas. Green River soda&#x27;s popularity is still remembered in Everett in the form of a &quot;Green River milkshake&quot; at Ray&#x27;s Drive-In, which opened in 1962.

It was popular as a soda fountain syrup, trailing only Coca-Cola in popularity throughout the Midwest. After Prohibition ended in 1933, the Schoenhofen Brewery continued to manufacture Green River, while resuming the production of alcoholic beverages. The brewery closed in 1950.

The Green River brand continued to be produced by a series of other manufacturers after the closing of Schoenhofen Edelweiss, including Clover Club Beverages of Chicago, which produced Green River in the 1980s. By 1992, Green River had shrunk to the point of only being sold in Chicago. According to one source, WIT Beverage Company acquired the brand in 2011, while a vendor indicates it was offering it still via an expanding Clover Club in 2013.

Sprecher Brewery acquired the Green River brand from Wit Beverage in October of 2021.

Green River is frequently marketed as a nostalgia item, and its sales increase in March due to the association of the color green with St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. While not widely commercially available, it can be purchased at some Chicago area restaurants and retailers and Menards as well as ordered directly from Sprecher Brewery.

==In popular culture==

Early 20th century entertainer Eddie Cantor, while with the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, penned a jingle for the soft drink entitled &quot;Green River&quot;. The ditty was performed by Cantor and the singing duo Van and Schenck. The refrain was:
The name of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song &quot;Green River&quot;, and accordingly the name of the album &quot;Green River&quot;, were inspired by the drink according to John Fogerty.

In Zen Studios&#x27; digital recreation of the Williams pinball tables &quot;The Party Zone&quot; and &quot;The Champion Pub&quot; in the game &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;, all depictions of beer are replaced with Green River as a precautionary act of censorship to avoid repercussions of having the game&#x27;s ESRB rating of Everyone 10+ changed.
Season 3, Episode 7, of the television show Las Vegas the 1962 character played by James Lesure orders a Green River at the Jubilee Casino restaurant.

<text>The Aerial Experiment Association (AEA) was a Canadian-American aeronautical research group formed on 30 September 1907, under the leadership of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell.

The AEA produced several different aircraft in quick succession, with each member acting as principal designer for at least one. The group introduced key technical innovations, notably wingtip ailerons and the tricycle landing gear.

According to Bell, the AEA was a &quot;co-operative scientific association, not for gain but for the love of the art and doing what we can to help one another.&quot; Although the association had no significant commercial impact, one of its members, Glenn Curtiss, later established a commercial venture that would ultimately become the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. The AEA was disbanded on 31 March 1909.

==Origins==

The AEA came into being when John Alexander Douglas McCurdy and his friend Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin, two recent engineering graduates of the University of Toronto, decided to spend the summer in Baddeck, Nova Scotia. McCurdy had grown up there, and his father was the personal secretary of Bell. He had grown up close to the Bell family and was well received in their home. One day, as the three sat with Bell discussing the problems of aviation, Mabel Bell, Alexander&#x27;s wife, suggested they create a formal research group to exploit their collective ideas. Being independently wealthy, she provided a total of US$35,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to finance the Association, with $20,000 made available immediately by the sale of property.

Curtiss, the American motorcycle designer and manufacturer and a recognized expert on gasoline engines, was recruited as a member of the association, and his associate Augustus Post assisted as representative from the Aero Club of America. Curtiss had visited the Wright brothers to discuss aeronautical engineering and offered them use of a 50 hp engine. Wilbur cordially declined, saying that a motor of their own development met their power needs, unaware that the AEA was about to become a serious competitor in powered flight. Bell wrote to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to have an interested young officer who had volunteered his help, U.S. Army Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge, officially detailed to Baddeck. Selfridge was assigned to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps on 3 August 1907, two days after its formation, and was sent to Nova Scotia. A year later, on 17 September 1908, while riding as a passenger with Orville Wright on a demonstration flight for the U.S. Army, he became the first person killed in an aircraft accident.

==First experiments==
In 1898, Bell experimented with man-lifting tetrahedral kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk. The tetrahedral wings were named &quot;Cygnet&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, and were flown both uncrewed and crewed (&quot;Cygnet I&quot; crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907 to 1912. Some of Bell&#x27;s kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.

==Later AEA designs==

The AEA&#x27;s work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. The AEA collaboration led to very public success. Casey Baldwin became the first Canadian and first British subject pilot on 12 March 1908 flight of &quot;Red Wing&quot;.

Its successor, &quot;White Wing&quot;, also of 1908, was the first airplane to have Bell&#x27;s ailerons. The following design, the &quot;June Bug&quot;, also of 1908 and piloted by Curtiss, won the &quot;Scientific American&quot; Trophy by making the first official one-kilometer flight in North America, although the Wrights had already accomplished this in 1904.

Their fourth flying machine, the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;, also constructed in 1908, made the first controlled powered flight in Canada on 23 February 1909 when it was flown off the ice of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake near Baddeck by McCurdy, who had been one of its designers. On 10 March 1909, McCurdy set a record when he flew the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; on a circular course over a distance of more than , a feat that the Wrights had already accomplished in 1905. The Association made the first passenger flight in Canada on 2 August, also in the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;.

Much development also took place in Hammondsport, New York, where in 1908 pioneering experimentation was done on seaplane carried out by Curtiss. In France Henri Fabre successfully flew the first powered seaplane in history, the Fabre Hydravion, in March 1910.

==Organization&#x27;s dissolution==

Bell&#x27;s organization was established with a fixed term mandate, which was extended to March 31, 1909, by joint agreement of all its members, with Mrs. Bell contributing an additional $10,000 of financing. After Lt. Selfridge&#x27;s death in September 1908, McCurdy became the organization&#x27;s secretary and Bell&#x27;s cousin, Charles J. Bell, became the Association&#x27;s legal trustee. In March 1909, strained relations arose between Curtiss and the Association&#x27;s other members. A request for him to attend the association&#x27;s meeting and resolve the issue went unanswered.

It was also in March that Curtiss abruptly announced a new commercial venture—in partnership with Augustus Moore Herring and backed by wealthy members of the Aero Club of America—called the Herring-Curtiss Company. This new development, plus the fact that it effectively displaced the AEA&#x27;s headquarters at Curtiss&#x27; own facility in Hammondsport, resulted in the AEA&#x27;s mandate expiring without further extension on March 31.

<doc id="479125" wikidata="Q2720134" url="?curid=479125" title="HowStuffWorks">
<text>HowStuffWorks is an American commercial infotainment website founded by professor and author Marshall Brain, to provide its target audience an insight into the way many things work. The site uses various media to explain complex concepts, terminology, and mechanisms—including photographs, diagrams, videos, animations, and articles.

The website was acquired by Discovery Communications in 2007, but was sold to Blucora in 2014. The site has since expanded out into podcasting, focusing on factual topics. In December 2016, HowStuffWorks, LLC became a subsidiary of OpenMail, LLC, later renamed System1. In 2018, the podcast division of the company, which had been spun-off by System1 under the name Stuff Media, was acquired by iHeartMedia for $55 million.

== History ==
In 1998, then North Carolina State University instructor Marshall Brain (1961–2024), started the site as a hobby. In 1999, Brain raised venture capital and formed HowStuffWorks, Inc. In March 2002, HowStuffWorks was sold to the Convex Group, an Atlanta-based investment and media company founded by Jeff Arnold, founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of WebMD. The headquarters moved from Cary, North Carolina, to Atlanta. HowStuffWorks originally focused on science and machines, ranging from submarines to common household gadgets and appliances. After adding a staff of writers, artists, and editors, content expanded to a larger array of topics.

On October 20, 2004, Stuffo.com was created, and HowStuffWorks moved its entertainment section over to the new website. In 2005, the team disbanded Stuffo.

The domain HowStuffWorks.com attracted at least 58 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.

There have been four HowStuffWorks books—two illustrated hardcover coffee table books, &quot;HowStuffWorks&quot; and &quot;More HowStuffWorks&quot;, and two un-illustrated paperbacks, &quot;How Much Does the Earth Weigh?&quot; and &quot;What If?&quot;. HowStuffWorks previously put out an educational magazine, &quot;HowStuffWorks Express&quot;, for middle-school students. The company has also released a series of HowStuffWorks trivia &quot;LidRock&quot; discs—CD-ROMs sold on fountain drink lids at Regal Theaters.

In 2005, HowStuffWorks became the exclusive online publisher for Publications International, Ltd., Consumer Guide and Mobil Travel Guide.

Howstuffworks.com spun off its international division when it went public (Nasdaq:HSWI) via an acquisition of INTAC, a China-based company. In March 2007, HSW International launched its Portuguese website with headquarters in São Paulo, Brazil. The Portuguese name of the site is Como Tudo Funciona (&quot;how everything works&quot;). In June 2008, the Chinese site was launched with new headquarters in Beijing, China. The URL roughly translates to &quot;Knowledge Information Web&quot;.

On October 15, 2007, Discovery Communications announced it had bought HowStuffWorks for $250 million. The company later chose to use the name HowStuffWorks as the title of a television series on its Discovery Channel. The series, which focuses on commodities, premiered in November 2008 and is similar in style and content to other &quot;how it works&quot; programs, like &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;.

On November 2, 2009, HSW International co-founded Sharecare, developing a social QA platform through which users ask health and wellness-related questions, receiving answers from industry experts. Other co-founders in Sharecare include Jeff Arnold, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Harpo Productions, Discovery Communications, and Sony Pictures Television.

On April 21, 2014, Discovery Communications announced that it had sold HowStuffWorks to Blucora for $45 million. In July 2016, Blucora announced the sale of its Infospace business, including HowStuffWorks, to OpenMail for $45 million. OpenMail was later renamed System1.

In 2014, HowStuffWorks moved its headquarters from Buckhead to Ponce City Market, a new mixed-use development in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta. In June 2017, it announced the hiring of Cracked.com founder and former editor-in-chief Jack O&#x27;Brien for its new comedy podcasting division.

In 2017, System1 spun off the podcast department of HowStuffWorks as Stuff Media, retaining the HowStuffWorks website. In September 2018, Stuff Media announced its sale to radio broadcaster iHeartMedia for $55 million.

== Podcasts ==
HowStuffWorks maintained a large number of podcasts, hosted by its staff writers and editors, but now all former HSW podcasts are owned and operated by iHeartRadio.

* &quot;Stuff You Should Know&quot;: an audio podcast and video series on various topics from all fields of interest
* &quot;TechStuff&quot;: dedicated to demystifying technology and discussing its impact on society, originally hosted by technology editor Chris Pollette and senior staff writer Jonathan Strickland. In January 2013, Chris Pollette was replaced as co-host by Social Media Editor Lauren Vogelbaum. Vogelbaum left the program in 2015 and Strickland became a solo host.
* &quot;Atlanta Monster&quot;: in cooperation with Tenderfoot TV, a crime podcast about the Atlanta murders of 1979–81, hosted by Payne Lindsey of podcast &quot;Up and Vanished&quot;
* &quot;Behind the Bastards&quot;: is a weekly comedic history podcast hosted by Robert Evans exploring the lives of deplorable historical figures.

Mandrake, along with the Phantom Magician in Mel Graff&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Patsy&quot;, is regarded as the first superhero of comics by comics historians such as Don Markstein, who writes, &quot;Some people say Mandrake the Magician, who started in 1934, was comics&#x27; first superhero.&quot;

Davis worked on the strip until his death in 1964, when Falk recruited artist Fred Fredericks. With Falk&#x27;s death in 1999, Fredericks became both writer and artist. The Sunday-newspaper &quot;Mandrake&quot; strip ended December 29, 2002. The daily newspaper strip ended mid-story on July 6, 2013, when Fred Fredericks retired, and a reprint of &quot;Pursuit of the Cobra&quot; (D220) from 1995 began July 8, 2013.

==Characters and story==
Mandrake is a magician whose work is based on an unusually fast hypnotic technique. As noted in captions, when Mandrake &quot;gestures hypnotically&quot;, his subjects see illusions, and Mandrake has used this technique against a variety of villains including gangsters, mad scientists, extraterrestrials, and characters from other dimensions. At various times in the comic strip, Mandrake also demonstrates other powers, including becoming invisible, shapeshifting, levitation, and teleporting. His hat, cloak, and wand, passed down from his father Theron, possess great magical properties, which in time Mandrake learns how to manipulate. Although Mandrake publicly works as a stage magician, he spends much of his time fighting criminals and combatting supernatural entities. Mandrake lives in Xanadu, a high-tech mansion atop a mountain in New York State. Xanadu&#x27;s features include closed-circuit TV, a sectional road which divides in half, and vertical iron gates.

===Leon Mandrake===
Leon Mandrake, a real-life magician, had been performing for well over ten years before Lee Falk introduced the comic strip character. Thus, he is sometimes thought to have been the source for the origin of the strip. Leon Mandrake, like the fictional Mandrake, was also known for his top hat, pencil-line mustache, and scarlet-lined cape. Ironically, Leon Mandrake had changed his stage name to Mandrake to match the popular strip and then legally changed his surname from Giglio to Mandrake later. The resemblance between the comic-strip hero and the real-life magician was close enough to allow Leon to at least passively allow the illusion that the strip was based on his stage persona. Leon Mandrake was accompanied by Narda, his first wife and stage assistant, named after a similar character, who appears in the strip. Velvet, his replacement assistant and eventual lifetime partner, would also later make appearances in the strip along with his real-life side-kick, Lothar.

==Other characters==
===Supporting===

Lothar is Mandrake&#x27;s best friend and crimefighting companion,
who Mandrake first met during his travels in Africa. Lothar was the Prince of the Seven Nations, a mighty federation of jungle tribes but forbore becoming king to follow Mandrake on his world travels. Lothar is often referred to as &quot;the strongest man in the world&quot;, with the exception of Hojo — Mandrake&#x27;s chef and secret chief of Inter Intel. Lothar is invulnerable to any weapon forged by man, is impervious to heat and cold, and possesses the stamina of a thousand men. He also cannot be harmed by magic directly (such as by fire bolts, force bolts, or spell incantations). He can easily lift an elephant by one hand. One of the first African crimefighting heroes ever to appear in comics, Lothar&#x27;s début alongside Mandrake was in the 1934 inaugural daily strip. In the beginning, Lothar spoke poor English and wore a fez, short pants, and a leopard skin. In a 1935 work by King Features Syndicate, Lothar is referred to as Mandrake&#x27;s &quot;giant black slave.&quot; When artist Fred Fredericks took over in 1965, Lothar spoke correct English and his clothing changed, although he often wore shirts with leopard-skin patterns.

Narda is Princess of the European nation Cockaigne, ruled by her brother Segrid. She made her first appearance in the second &quot;Mandrake&quot; story. Even though she and Mandrake were initially infatuated with each other, they did not marry until 1997, when an extravagant triple wedding ceremony at Mandrake&#x27;s home of Xanadu, Narda&#x27;s home country Cockaigne, and Mandrake&#x27;s father Theron&#x27;s College of Magic (&quot;Collegium Magikos&quot;) in the Himalayas. Narda learned martial arts from Hojo.

Theron is the headmaster of the College of Magic (Collegium Magikos) located in the Himalayas. He is hundreds of years old and may be kept alive by the Mind Crystal, of which he is the guardian.

Hojo, who knows six languages, is Mandrake&#x27;s chef at his home of Xanadu and the secret chief of the international crimefighting organization Inter-Intel. As such, he has enlisted Mandrake&#x27;s help with many cases. He is also a superb martial-arts expert. Hojo&#x27;s assistant at Inter-Intel is Jed.

The Police Chief is named Bradley but mostly called Chief. Mandrake aided him on several occasions. The Chief created the S.S.D. (Silly Stuff Dept.) for absurd and unbelievable cases that only Mandrake could solve. He has a son, Chris.

Magnon, the emperor of the galaxy, is Mandrake&#x27;s most powerful friend and, with his wife Carola, has a daughter, Nardraka. She was named after Mandrake and Narda and is their godchild.

Lenore is Mandrake&#x27;s younger half-sister. She is a world-renowned explorer.

Karma is Lothar&#x27;s girlfriend, an African princess who works as a model.

===Villains===
The Cobra is Mandrake&#x27;s most evil and dangerous foe, apparent from the start of the story. In 1937, the Cobra seemed to be defeated, but returned in 1965, wearing a menacing silver mask. The Cobra&#x27;s main goal is to acquire one of the two powerful Crystal Cubes, which increase mental energy. Mandrake and his father Theron guard them. Mandrake learned that The Cobra was secretly Luciphor, Theron&#x27;s oldest son and, thus, Mandrake&#x27;s half-brother. In later years, the Cobra was able to abandon his silver mask because his face had been reconstructed through surgery. He is sometimes accompanied by his assistant Ud, later revealed to be Octon, the leader of the 8.

Derek is Mandrake&#x27;s twin brother and, thus, similar to Mandrake in appearance. He used his magical powers, which were nearly the same as Mandrake&#x27;s, to achieve short-term personal satisfaction. Mandrake tried to remove Derek&#x27;s knowledge of magic but never entirely succeeded. Derek&#x27;s son Eric, with an unknown mother, shows no signs of following in his father&#x27;s footsteps.

The Clay Camel, real name Saki, is a master of disguise, able to mimic anyone and change his appearance in seconds. His name comes from the symbol he leaves at the scenes of his crimes, a small camel made of clay.

The Brass Monkey, daughter of the Clay Camel, has a similar talent for disguises.

Aleena the Enchantress is a former friend of Mandrake&#x27;s from the College of Magic and a much-married spoiled temptress who uses her magic powers to benefit herself. She sometimes attempts to seduce Mandrake, but fails and, afterward, attempts to cause him trouble.

8 is an old and very powerful crime organization originating in medieval times. Members are known to often incorporate the number 8 in their crimes or leave the number 8 as a mark. They are organized like an octopus with eight arms, as in its headquarters, which are spread all over the world. One head — the mysterious leader Octon — is only shown as a menacing image on a computer screen. Over the years, Mandrake destroys the various headquarters one by one. In one episode, the Octon of 8 is revealed as Cobra, but the name later refers to an artificial intelligence wielded by Ming the Merciless in the television series &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;.

Ekardnam, &quot;Mandrake&quot; spelled backward, is Mandrake&#x27;s &quot;evil twin&quot;, who exists on the other side of a mirror. Like his world, in which the government is run by the Private of the Armies and generals do menial tasks, Ekardnam is an exact opposite and uses his &quot;evil eye&quot; to work his magic.

The Deleter is an extraterrestrial contract killer who will &quot;delete&quot; anyone for a price but will inflict justice on anyone who tries to cheat him out of his contract fee.

Nitro Cain is a mad bomber who throws sticks of explosives at people, including Mandrake. After the Mandrake comic strip appeared in the Australian newspaper &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the series was later abruptly withdrawn with the last panel showing that Nitro Cain had blown Mandrake off a horse, with Mandrake exclaiming: &quot;Blast you, Nitro Cain&quot;, a clever reference to the explosive&#x27;s blast.

==The newspaper strip==
Oddly, newspapers did not carry any Mandrake daily strips with dates between June 26 and June 30, 1940. Instead, they carried strips dated one week later. The following week, to catch up, newspapers ran a week of undated strips. Some newspapers even scratched out the date printed on the strip and by hand wrote in the correct date.

==Comic books==
Mandrake had a prominent role in &quot;Magic Comics&quot;, a compilation of newspaper comic strip reprints published by David McKay Company from 1939 to 1949. Mandrake was the cover star for issues nos. 8 through 24. Beginning with issue no. 25, an illustration of Mandrake became part of the magazine&#x27;s logo.

Dell Comics published a &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; issue in its &quot;Four Color&quot; comic book series with various main characters. The &quot;Mandrake&quot; issue, no. 752, featured original stories by Stan Campell and written by Paul Newman.

In 1966–67, King Comics published ten issues of a &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; comic book. Most of the stories were remakes of past newspaper strip stories and featured art by André LeBlanc, and others. &quot;Mandrake&quot; stories also ran as backup features in other King titles.

Italian publisher Fratelli Spada produced a considerable amount of original &quot;Mandrake&quot; comic-book stories in the 1960s and 1970s. A few were also published in the American &quot;Mandrake&quot; comic book mentioned above.

Marvel released a &quot;Mandrake&quot; mini-series in 1995, written by Mike W. Barr with painted art by Rob Ortaleza. However, only two of three planned issues were published.

&quot;Mandrake&quot; has also enjoyed great success in comic books published in Britain, Australia, Brazil, India, France, Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, and Sweden. Although, in the Nordic countries, it was most often a backup feature in &quot;The Phantom&quot; comic books. As well, &quot;Mandrake&quot; is popular in India through Indrajal Comics.

Mandrake is featured together with the Phantom in &quot;The Phantom Annual #2&quot;, written by Mike Bullock and Kevin Grevioux and published by Moonstone Books.

In 2013, Dynamite Entertainment launched a mini-series, &quot;Kings Watch&quot;, in which, much like &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, Mandrake and Lothar teamed up with the Phantom, Flash Gordon, Dale Arden, and Hans Zarkov. The series pitted the six characters against the Cobra and Ming the Merciless. This was followed by a &quot;Mandrake&quot; solo comic, written by Roger Langridge and drawn by Jeremy Treece, as part of Dynamite&#x27;s &quot;King: Dynamite&quot; series.

In July 2020, King Features Syndicate, Red 5 Comics, and StoneBot Studios announced the series &quot;Legacy of Mandrake the Magician&quot;, written by Erica Schultz and drawn by Diego Giribaldi, Juan Pablo Massa, and Moncho Bunge. The series tells the story of teenage magic apprentice Mandragora Constanza Terrado Paz, known more simply as &quot;Mandy&quot; Paz. Mandy&#x27;s mother is a fortune teller and they live in a building owned by Mandrake the Magician, whom Mandy&#x27;s mother knows personally. Mandy&#x27;s best friend is LJ, the teenage son of Lothar. While investigating Mandrake&#x27;s storage room, Mandy discovers a magic mirror containing the spirit of a magician called Alruin, who then begins the girl&#x27;s training in magic.

In 2024, Mad Cave Studios published a new Flash Gordon comic book, a trade paperback of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; series and launched a new series of the team.

==In other media==
===Radio===
&quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; was a 15-minute radio serial, which aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System from November 11, 1940, until February 6, 1942.

===Films===
In 1939, Columbia produced a 12-part &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; serial, based on the King Features strip, starring Warren Hull as Mandrake and Al Kikume as Lothar. The serial is available on DVD.

An unauthorized &quot;Mandrake&quot; movie produced in Turkey was made in 1967, &quot;Mandrake Killing&#x27;in Peşinde&quot;, also known as &quot;Mandrake Killing&#x27;e Karşı&quot; / Mandrake Against Killing), directed by Oksal Pekmezoğlu and starring Güven Erte as Mandrake.

====Unproduced films====
In the 1960s, Federico Fellini, a close friend of Falk, intended to make a &quot;Mandrake&quot; movie, but the project was never realized.

In the early 1980s, within two weeks of signing with his first agent, American filmmaker Michael Almereyda was hired by Embassy Pictures to rewrite a script for &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;. He told &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine that, upon receiving the assignment, he flew to New York City and checked himself into the Chelsea Hotel to work on the rewrite. Three weeks later, he emerged with a new draft, but by then the studio had changed heads, and, in as little time as his revision took, the project was dropped.

In 2007, Baldwin Entertainment Group and Hyde Park Entertainment purchased rights to make a &quot;Mandrake&quot; movie to be directed by Mimi Leder. The two companies own the rights to Lee Falk&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom&quot;. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was originally projected to play the title character with Chuck Russell as director. In 2009, Hayden Christensen replaced Rhys Meyers in the title role of the film with Djimon Hounsou co-starring and Mimi Leder directing. In June 2016, Sacha Baron Cohen was cast as Mandrake.

===Television===
====Live-action====
NBC made a pilot for a &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; TV series in 1954, but no other episodes were made. Stage magician Coe Norton starred as Mandrake and Woody Strode as Lothar.

Anthony Herrera had the title role in the TV film &quot;Mandrake&quot; with Ji-Tu Cumbuka as Lothar. Magician Harry Blackstone Jr. was featured in the cast.

====Animation====
Mandrake and Lothar first appeared in animated form with the Phantom, Flash Gordon, and Steve Canyon in 1972 television special &quot;The Man Who Hated Laughter&quot;.

In the animated series &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; (1986–87), Mandrake the Magician teams with fellow King Features adventurers Flash Gordon and The Phantom. Mandrake&#x27;s best friend and crime-fighting partner Lothar also has a prominent role, as well as a teenage son nicknamed L.J. (Lothar Jr.) who is a martial artist. Mandrake has an adopted son of Asian blood named Kshin, whom he is training as his apprentice and heir. Peter Renaday provided the voice of Mandrake and Buster Jones provided Lothar&#x27;s. The entire series has been released by BCI Eclipse as a two-DVD set in America, while Fremantle Media released the entire series on DVD in the UK. The series can be seen on the Pluto TV Classic Toons channel.

In animated series &quot;Phantom 2040&quot;, featuring a future Phantom, Mandrake appears in the episode &quot;The Magician&quot;. He is not named in the episode but rather presented as an old friend of that Phantom&#x27;s father, a magician who helped build much of previous Phantom&#x27;s previous equipment. His remarkably well-preserved shape is compatible with the longevity-conferring properties of the Crystals. Peter Renaday once again provides the voice of Mandrake.

===Theater===
The musical &quot;Mandrake the Magician and the Enchantress&quot; was produced during the late 1970s at the Lenox Arts Festival in Massachusetts. The script is by Falk and Thayer Burch with music by George Quincy and lyrics by Burch.

Mandrake is a character in the play &quot;King Kong Palace&quot;, written by Chilean playwright Marco Antonio de la Parra. In the play, Mandrake is now a performer at birthday parties, in which he attempts to seduce Jane, the ambitious wife of Tarzan, in order to satisfy his lust for power.

==Parodies and tributes==

&quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; has inspired several other comic characters with magic powers, including Zatara, Kardak the Mystic Magician (Top-Notch Comics), Monako, Dakor the Magician, Ibis the Invincible, Mantor the Magician, Sargon the Sorcerer, Zatanna, Mr. Mystic, The Wizard, Mysto, Dr. Strange, and Magician Detective, as well as the short-lived Jim the Magician (Jadugar Jim in Hindi) by Sudhir Tailang in India.

In &quot;Mad&quot; no. 14 (August 1954), Mandrake was spoofed as &quot;Manduck&quot;. He lives in a city dump, which he convinces visitors is a palatial home by &quot;gesturing hypnotically&quot;. In this story, he matches wits with The Shadow; he, Lothar (called Loathar), and The Shadow all gesture hypnotically at each other, and, after a huge explosion, only Lothar (looking like Manduck) remains. In another issue, Manduck pulls off the trick of turning Loathar into a blonde woman.

Gianni Garko has stated that the new interpretation of his Sartana character in the 1968 Spaghetti Western film &quot;If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death&quot; presented by the film&#x27;s director Gianfranco Parolini, of a gunfighter with seemingly supernatural luck, was influenced by Mandrake the Magician.

&quot;In Pictopia&quot; (first published in &quot;Anything Goes!&quot; no. 2 (August 1986) is a short story by Alan Moore and illustrator Don Simpson, which takes place in a limbo world of comic-book characters. Main character Nocturno the Necromancer is based on Mandrake. The story was reprinted in George Khoury&#x27;s &quot;The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore&quot; (TwoMorrows, July 2003).

Michael Kupperman&#x27;s &quot;Tales Designed to Thrizzle&quot; (Fantagraphics) pokes fun at many comics, including &quot;Mandrake the Magician,&quot; with three-panel strip &quot;Mancake the Magician&quot;.

In France, Mandrake was spoofed as Rasmus, Zembla&#x27;s comic sidekick in &quot;&quot; (Augusto Pedrazza, 1963-1979).

In the episode 106 of the Argentine comic &quot;Mi novia y yo&quot;, Mandrake makes a cameo at the end of the story.

==In popular culture==
New Zealand-born Australian country and western singer Tex Morton had a successful song &quot;Mandrake&quot; recorded in 1941. It was about a rodeo horse named Mandrake who never bucked the same, explaining, &quot;Mandrake is a wizard so that&#x27;s how he got his name&quot;.

Professional baseball player Don Mueller, active in Major League Baseball from 1948 to 1959, was nicknamed &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; for being adept at consistently putting the ball in play and delivering hits through the infield.

In Italy, a popular saying &quot;non sono mica Mandrake&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m no Mandrake&quot;, meaning &quot;I can&#x27;t do what&#x27;s impossible&quot;), refers to the magician.

In Colombia, a popular saying &quot;sabrá Mandrake&quot; (&quot;only Mandrake would know&quot;, meaning &quot;only someone all-knowing / with mental powers would know&quot;), also refers to the magician.

<text>Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) was a serial transport protocol used to attach disk drives to server computers. It was developed by IBM employee Ian Judd in 1990 to provide data redundancy for critical applications. SSA was deployed in server RAID environments, where it was capable of providing for up to 80 MB/s of data throughput, with sustained data rates as high as 60 MB/s in non-RAID mode and 35 MB/s in RAID mode.

SSA was promoted as an open standard by the SSA Industry Association, unlike its predecessor, the first generation Serial Disk Subsystem. A number of vendors including IBM, Pathlight Technology and Vicom Systems produced products based on SSA. It was also adopted as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X3T10.1 standard. SSA devices are logically SCSI devices and conform to all of the SCSI command protocols.

==History==
SSA was invented by Ian Judd of IBM in 1990. IBM produced a number of successful products based upon this standard before it was overtaken by the more widely adopted Fibre Channel protocol.

==Link characteristics==
All the components in a typical SSA subsystem are connected by bi-directional cabling. Data sent from the adaptor can travel in either direction around the loop to its destination. SSA detects interruptions in the loop and automatically reconfigures the system to help maintain connection while a link is restored.

Up to 192 hot swappable hard disk drives can be supported per system. Drives can be designated for use by an array in the event of hardware failure. Up to 32 separate RAID arrays can be supported per adaptor, and arrays can be mirrored across servers to provide cost-effective protection for critical applications. Arrays are connected by thin and inexpensive copper cables situated up to 25 metres apart, allowing subsystems to be located in secure, convenient locations, far from the server itself.

The copper cables used in SSA configurations are round bundles of two or four twisted pairs, up to 25 metres long and terminated with 9-pin micro-D connectors. Impedances are 75 ohm single-ended, and 150 ohm differential. For longer-distance connections, it is possible to use fiber-optic cables up to 10 km (6 mi) in length. Signals are differential TTL. The transmission capacity is 20 megabytes per second in each direction per channel, with up to two channels per cable. The transport layer protocol is non-return-to-zero, with 8B/10B encoding (10 bits per character). Higher protocol layers were based on the SCSI-3 standard.

<text>What If, sometimes stylized as What If…?, is a comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics whose stories explore how the Marvel Universe might have unfolded if key moments in its history had not occurred as they did in mainstream continuity. Since &quot;What If&quot; debuted in 1977, the comics have been published in 14 series as well as occasional stand-alone issues. In 2024, Marvel announced that &quot;What If…?&quot; would expand to include alternate explorations of continuity within other non-Marvel Universe properties owned by their parent company The Walt Disney Company from its fifteenth volume onwards, beginning with Aliens: What If…?, based on the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise.

In 2021, an animated series based on the &quot;What If&quot; comics premiered on Disney+, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s multiverse.

==Format==
The stories of the inaugural series (1977–1984) feature the alien Uatu, the Watcher as a narrator. From his base on the Moon, Uatu observes both Earth and alternate realities.

Most &quot;What If&quot; stories begin with Uatu describing an event in the mainstream Marvel Universe, then introducing a point of divergence in that event and then describing the consequences of the divergence. Some stories diverge from another divergence, such as &quot;What If&quot; Vol 1 #43 (Conan the Barbarian remains in the modern era), which diverges from #13 (Conan travels to then returns from the modern era).

Uatu was used similarly in the second series (1989–1998) until a point where, in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic book, Uatu was punished for destroying another Watcher. This made the use of Uatu improbable, so the character was phased out to its last appearance in issue #76. Without a framing device, the stories themselves became the focus.

In later series, some writers chose to introduce alternative narrators. For example, in volume 3, in &quot;What If Karen Page Had Lived?&quot;, &quot;What If Jessica Jones Had Joined the Avengers?&quot; and in &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2005), Brian Michael Bendis, the writer himself, makes a cameo as narrator. In the early 2006 series, a hacker, whose online alias is &quot;the Watcher&quot;, opens each of the six issues.

Marvel has given several &quot;What If&quot; stories official numerical designations to make them contiguous with the Marvel Multiverse and differentiate them from the main Marvel Universe of Earth-616.

Marvel Comics occasionally issued features, &quot;Untold Tales from the Marvel Universe&quot;. These stories explained the origins of some of Marvel&#x27;s superhuman species.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===
The initial 47-issue series ran from February 1977 to October 1984. The first &quot;What If&quot; story was &quot;What If Spider-Man had Joined the &quot;Fantastic Four?&quot;. It presented an alternate version of events seen in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1 (1963). &quot;What If&quot; #24, which is titled &quot;What If Gwen Stacy had lived?&quot; and focuses on the consequences of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity being publicly exposed, is one of the most highly regarded &quot;What If&quot; stories.

==== List of What If? stories ====

=== Special ===
Following the cancellation of the original series, Marvel published a one-shot &quot;What If? Special&quot; (June 1988) with the story &quot;What If Iron Man Had Been a Traitor?&quot;. It is collected in &quot;What If? Into the Multiverse Omnibus&quot; Vol 1.

===Volume 2===
From July 1989 to November 1998, Marvel published 115 monthly &quot;What If&quot; issues (114 issues plus a #-1 issue) the second series revisited and revised ideas from volume 1. In volume 2, stories could span multiple issues (every issue of volume 1 contained a complete story). Also, sometimes, the volume 2 stories would offer multiple plots and endings and the reader could decide which one to adopt. For example, in &quot;What If the War Machine had not destroyed the Living Laser?&quot;, three endings were offered.

The humorous aspect of volume 1 was retained through volume 2, particularly in issue #34, an all-humor issue containing a number of single-page gags and two complete stories.

Starting with issue #87, the issue titles stopped being questions that were answered by the story, and instead the covers were presented as &quot;What If? Starring…&quot; whatever character was being highlighted in the given issue.

In issue #105, &quot;What If&quot; introduced Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker); the new character was popular enough for a spin-off series. From this, the MC2 line of publications were developed.

For a brief period between 1995 and 1996, all &quot;What If?&quot; stories were labeled as Marvel Alterniverse which included the likes of &quot;Ruins&quot;, &quot;The Last Avengers Story&quot; and &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;.

==== List of What If? (vol. 2) stories ====
===Volume 3===
In February 2005, Marvel published a further six issues of &quot;What If&quot;. They were all in the &quot;one-shot&quot; format. The editor, Justin Gabrie, attributed the publication of volume 3 to a suggestion from C. B. Cebulski.

Marvel published a single parody edition called &quot;Wha...Huh?!?&quot; in August 2005.

* What If Jessica Jones Had Joined The Avengers? (Also collected in &quot;Jessica Jones: Avenger&quot;)
* What If Karen Page Had Lived? 
* What If Aunt May Had Died Instead Of Uncle Ben? 
* What If Dr. Doom Had Become The Thing? 
* What If Magneto Had Formed The X-Men With Professor X? 
* What If General Ross Had Become The Hulk?

===Volume 4===
In February 2006, publication of volume 4 began. Again, there were six issues in the &quot;one-shot&quot; format. However, rather than follow &quot;What if&quot; tradition of using a divergence from a specific plot point, Volume 4 more closely resembled the DC Comics equivalent, &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, which presents stories that are continuities based on alternate versions (in time or place) of canon (for example, &quot;&quot; is a story in which Superman was raised in the Soviet Union instead of the United States) all but one of the volume 4 issues uses this format, explained by Uatu the Watcher having discovered historical documents from an alternative dimension. From the Japanese feudal era, the divergence of a shared alternate universe, Earth-717, begins. This divergence is the time when a Daredevil hero known as &quot;the Devil Who Dares&quot; appears. It is also the realm where characters are given alternative life histories and where they proceed in alternative historical periods.

Examples from volume 4 include Captain America battling the &quot;White Skull&quot; during the American Civil War; Wolverine taking on the role of the Punisher and fighting mobsters in 1920s Prohibition-era Chicago; Namor the Sub-Mariner being raised by his father on the surface during World War II; Thor becoming a herald of Galactus; and a Soviet version of the Fantastic Four, known as the &quot;Ultimate Federalist Freedom Fighters&quot; (consisting of Rudion Richards, Colossus, Magik and the Widow Maker), during the Cold War.

* What If...Captain America fought in the Civil War? 
* What If...the Fantastic Four were Cosmonauts? 
* What If...Daredevil lived in feudal Japan? 
* What If...Namor grew up on land? 
* What If...Thor was a herald of Galactus? 
* What If...Wolverine was Public Enemy No. 1 in mob-ridden 1920s Chicago?

===Volume 5===
In 2006, Marvel published another set of &quot;What If?&quot; issues, including one based on the Spider-Man story &quot;The Other&quot;.

* &quot;What If? Avengers Disassembled&quot; #1: &quot;Witchhunt: What if the Scarlet Witch hadn&#x27;t acted alone?&quot;
* &quot;What If? Spider-Man The Other&quot; #1: &quot;What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? Poison Selves&quot;
* &quot;What If? Wolverine Enemy of the State&quot; #1: &quot;What if Wolverine was never Deprogrammed? Bite the Hand that Feeds&quot;
* &quot;What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse&quot; #1: &quot;…What If Legion Had Killed Xavier and Magneto?&quot;&quot;
* &quot;What If? X-Men Deadly Genesis&quot; #1: &quot;What If Xavier&#x27;s Secret Second Team Had Survived?&quot;

===Volume 6===
Volume 6 consists of five issues (2007–2008). A sixth, &quot;What If: This Was the Fantastic Four&quot;, featuring Spider-Man, Wolverine, Ghost Rider and Hulk, was to be released in November 2007, but it was withheld due to the death of Mike Wieringo. &quot;What If: This Was the Fantastic Four&quot; was released as a tribute to Wieringo in June 2008 as a 48-page special. All its proceeds went to the Hero Initiative.

The other issues were:

* What If?: Planet Hulk (October 2007)
* What If?: Annihilation (November 2007) 
* What If?: Civil War (December 2007)
* What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire (December 2007)
* What If? Spider-Man vs. Wolverine (January 2008)

These issues were collected into a trade paperback, &quot;What If...? Civil War&quot;.

===Volume 7===
In December 2008, Marvel published five &quot;What If&quot; specials which appeared weekly. They included: &quot;Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America&quot;, &quot;House of M&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Back in Black&quot;, and &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. A new &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; consisted of the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Wolverine. In addition, a story line featuring the Runaways as the Young Avengers ran throughout Volume 7.

* &quot;What If? House of M&quot; #1: &quot;What If...Scarlet Witch Ended the &#x27;House of M&#x27; By Saying, &#x27;No More Power?&#x27;&quot; (February 2009)
* &quot;What If? Fallen Son&quot; #1: &quot;What If...Iron Man Had Died?&quot; (February 2009)
* &quot;What If? Newer Fantastic Four&quot; #1: &quot;What If...Newer Fantastic Four?&quot; (February 2009)
* &quot;What If? Spider-Man Back in Black&quot; #1: &quot;What If...Mary Jane Had Been Shot Instead of Aunt May?&quot; (February 2009)
* &quot;What If? Secret Wars&quot; #1: &quot;What If Doctor Doom Kept the Beyonder&#x27;s Power?&quot; (February 2009)

===Volume 8===
In December 2009, a new series was published. Volume 8 focused on three recent events in the Marvel Universe, including the &quot;Spider-Man: House of M&quot; miniseries and the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; and &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; story lines. There was also an edition focusing on the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; series and a classic &quot;What If?&quot; about Daredevil and Elektra. With the exception of this last issue, each comic in Volume 8 featured two alternatives for the event.

* &quot;What If? Secret Invasion&quot; #1: &quot;What if the Skrulls succeeded in their Secret Invasion?&quot; (February 2010)
* &quot;What If? World War Hulk&quot; #1: &quot;What If The Heroes Lost World War Hulk?&quot; (February 2010)
* &quot;What If? Daredevil Vs. Elektra&quot; #1: &quot;What If Daredevil Died Saving Elektra?&quot; (February 2010)
* &quot;What If? Astonishing X-Men&quot; #1: &quot;&quot;What If Ord Resurrected Jean Grey Instead of Colossus?&quot;:&quot; (February 2010)

===Volume 9===
In September 2010, Marvel announced a ninth series of five &quot;What If&quot; issues in the one-shot format, to be released in December 2010. The second to fifth issues of volume 9 were not numbered.

* &quot;What If? Iron Man: Demon in an Armor&quot; #1: &quot;What If Tony Stark Had Become Doctor Doom?&quot; (February 2011)
* &quot;What If? Wolverine: Father&quot; #1: &quot;Wolverine: Father&quot; (February 2011)
* &quot;What If? Spider-Man&quot; #1: &quot;What If? Spider-Man Killed Kraven the Hunter?&quot; (February 2011)
* &quot;What If? Dark Reign&quot; #1 (February 2011)
* &quot;Venom/Deadpool: What If?&quot; #1 (April 2011)

&quot;What If?&quot; #200 was an extra-sized edition featuring two stories. It presented an alternative for the Siege Marvel Universe event, asking what might have happened if the Sentry had not lost control and Norman Osborn had conquered Asgard. The second story examined &quot;The Galactus Trilogy&quot;, and was written by Stan Lee, the author of the original.

===Volume 10===
On March 22, 2013, Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief Axel Alonso revealed to Comic Book Resources that &quot;What If…?&quot; was coming back with &quot;What If…? Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, a four-issue limited series written by Jimmy Palmiotti and illustrated by Jorge Molina.

===Volume 11===
In April 2014, Marvel released the five-issue series &quot;What If? Age of Ultron&quot;, which spun out of the 2013 event and examined the consequences of Wolverine going back in time to kill Hank Pym before he created Ultron. Each issue explored what a new universe would be like which arose from the removal of another core Avenger, with the Wasp in #1, Iron Man in #2, Thor in #3 and Captain America in #4. The series was concluded in #5 with a world where Hank Pym never created Ultron in the first place and thus, a universe without Ultron&#x27;s creation of the Vision.

===Volume 12===
In October 2015, Marvel released another five-part series of stories under the &quot;What If?&quot; banner, this time focused on the 2013 story line &quot;Infinity&quot;, which saw the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Inhumans and other groups dealing with a combined threat of a universal incursion by the race the Builders, and an attack on Earth by Thanos and his forces. Each issue is a self-contained story, and the first four explore a different outcome to the event. The fifth, &quot;What If? Infinity: Dark Reign&quot;, presents a world in which Norman Osborn and the Dark Avengers had acquired the Infinity Gauntlet during the 2008 - 09 &quot;Dark Reign&quot; story line.

* What If? Infinity: Thanos 
* What If? Infinity: Inhumans

* What If? Infinity: Guardians Of The Galaxy

In October 2018, Marvel released six more one-shots under the &quot;What If?&quot; banner, as well as several $1.00 &quot;True Believer&quot; reprints of classic &quot;What If?&quot; issues. These included stories where Peter Parker became the Punisher, where the X-Men existed in a Cyberpunk universe, where Thor was raised by the Frost Giants instead of his brother Loki being raised by Odin, and where Magik was trained from a young age by Stephen Strange rather than joining the New Mutants.

In 2021, Marvel published a five-issue miniseries titled &quot;Spider-Man: Spider’s Shadow&quot;, detailing what if Peter Parker fully accepted the alien symbiote and became Venom. While it did not have the title of &quot;What If?&quot;, it did have the branding on the cover.

=== Volume 14 ===
In 2022, Marvel published a five-issue miniseries exploring what would happen if Miles Morales had acquired the powers of different Marvel super-heroes. The first four issues saw him become Captain America, Wolverine, Hulk, and Thor, and the final issue was a team-up of the four divergent Miles.

=== &quot;What If...? Dark&quot; ===
In 2023, Marvel published six one-shots under the title What If... Dark?, which revisited iconic Marvel stories with a darker twist.

=== &quot;Aliens: What If…?&quot; ===
In 2024, Marvel announced that &quot;What If…?&quot; would move beyond solely the Marvel Universe to explore alternate takes on the continuities of other franchises owned by their parent company The Walt Disney Company, beginning with Aliens: What If…?, based on the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, the first five-issue arc of which would explore the scenario &quot;What If… Carter Burke had lived?&quot;, exploring what would happen if the character of Carter Burke had survived the events of the 1986 film &quot;Aliens&quot;, with the series to be written by the character&#x27;s actor Paul Reiser, his son Leon Reiser, as well as Adam F. Goldberg, Brian Volk-Weiss, and Hans Rodionoff, with art by Guiu Vilanova.

=== &quot;What If...? Venom&quot; ===
In 2024, Marvel announced a five-issue miniseries exploring what would happen if the Venom symbiote had bonded with different Marvel super-heroes. Over the course of the run, the symbiote will bond with She-Hulk, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Loki, and Moon Knight in a single continuity.

&quot;What If&quot; serves as inspiration for media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):
* The fourth season of the TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; features a story arc loosely inspired by the &quot;What If&quot; series, with the first episode of it being named after the comic book series. Throughout the arc, Holden Radcliffe and his A.I. assistant Aida develop a virtual world called the Framework, which depicts the lives of several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents under drastically different circumstances.
* A self-titled animated series based on &quot;What If&quot; depicts the Watcher (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) observing events in the MCU multiverse occurring differently.

<text>York Road is a disused station on the London Underground in Kings Cross, London, England, located between King&#x27;s Cross and Caledonian Road, with its entrance at the corner of York Road (now York Way) and Bingfield Street.

It opened in 1906 and was one of the original stations on the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR), the precursor to today&#x27;s Piccadilly line. The surface buildings were constructed in the distinctive style of architect Leslie Green, and were connected to the platforms by a single lift shaft containing two lifts. Traffic levels were never high, and the station closed in 1932, on the same day that the northern extension of the Piccadilly Line from Finsbury Park to Arnos Grove opened.

London Transport Museum runs regular Zoom-hosted tours of the station through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme. The tour features original elements of the station including the tiled lift lobby and signal cabin and it explores the modifications that were made to the station over the years.

York Road station was located at the junction between York Road, which has since been renamed York Way, and Bingfield Street. The architect Leslie Green designed the building, which was similar to many of his designs, being finished in ruby-red glazed tiling supplied by the Leeds Fireclay Company. The contract for construction was awarded to Ford and Walton, and the booking hall was at the surface level. It was linked to the platforms by a circular lift shaft, in diameter, which contained two electric lifts; there was also a staircase for emergency use. The lifts were manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company, and Colonel H A Yorke, who inspected the station at the time of its opening on behalf of the Board of Trade, recorded that they rose from the platform level to the booking hall level.

Unlike most other Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway stations, where the lifts stopped at a mezzanine level a little above the platforms, and required passengers to descend a final flight of stairs to reach the trains, the lifts at York Road descended directly to platform level. This meant that the platforms were further apart, and the interconnecting passages were longer as a result. The eastbound platform was long, while the westbound platform was slightly longer. The platform layout was almost identical to that at Caledonian Road, but the two tracks curved outwards in the middle of the station to accommodate the extra width of the lift shaft bases.

The platform tiling was carried out by George Woolliscroft &amp; Son of Hanley, Staffordshire, and was made up of white with maroon and brick red patterning. Most of the tiling has since been painted over in grey, but a small section remains untouched and can be seen at the Finsbury Park end of the former eastbound platform. The station was ventilated by a fan, which drew air out of the station at a rate of per minute.

A small signalling cabin stands near the unpainted tiling, and was used to operate a crossover immediately to the northeast of the station. This signal box remained operational until 25 April 1964, although by that time the crossover was little used, having been largely superseded by a new one commissioned at King&#x27;s Cross on 25 November 1956. However, the disused cabin still stands and can be seen from passing trains.

Being sited in a poor industrial area, the station saw little use, and from October 1909, some trains did not stop at the platforms, in order to improve service times to the other stations. The Sunday services were withdrawn entirely from 5 May 1918. The station remained open for weekday and Saturday traffic only, and closed on 4 May 1926, when the general strike began. Although the strike only lasted for nine days, the station remained closed. However the subject of its closure was eventually raised in the House of Commons, and it reopened in October 1926, but the reprieve was short-lived, lasting until 19 September 1932 when it was permanently closed. The closure occurred on the same day as the northern extension of the Piccadilly Line from Finsbury Park to Arnos Grove opened.

The surface station buildings are still clearly visible, on the left heading south down York Way towards King&#x27;s Cross. They were used by the Victor Printing Company following closure, but eventually became derelict. They were refurbished in 1989, when the removal of boards covering the facade enabled the original lettering to be seen once again. The former platform area below is also visible from passing trains in both directions, although part of the eastbound platform is bricked off. As with most other disused Underground stations, the platform itself has been removed. As the site is currently used as an emergency exit from the tunnels, one of the passageways between the platforms is permanently lit by a series of lamps.

==Proposed reopening==
One of London&#x27;s largest redevelopment projects, King&#x27;s Cross Central, began construction in 2008 across the road from the station. Islington council and Transport for London (TfL) commissioned a study in 2005 to consider the possible reopening of the station. At the same time, however, it was recognised that other transport priorities reduced the likelihood of such a project moving forward in the near future. The site would need extensive overhauls to bring the station up to modern day standards, at a cost estimated at £21 million in 2005. Local political groups have been keen to see the station reopened in order to reduce passenger congestion at and to encourage development in the surrounding community. The Liberal Democrats advocated the reopening of the station in their 2006 local election manifesto, and at least one candidate for the Conservative Party similarly campaigned for the station to be reopened.

In June 2017, the council and Transport for London were reportedly discussing the possible reopening of Maiden Lane overground and York Road underground stations. The reopening of Maiden Lane was considered to be more likely, as York Road is quite close to Kings Cross St Pancras, and the new station would increase journey times on the Piccadilly line.

<text>Oscar Traynor (21 March 1886 – 14 December 1963) was an Irish republican and Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Justice from 1957 to 1961, Minister for Defence from 1939 to 1948 and 1951 to 1954, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1936 to 1939 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence from June 1936 to November 1936. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1925 to 1927 and 1932 to 1961.

He was also involved with association football, being the president of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) from 1948 until 1963.

==Life==
Oscar Traynor was born on 21 March 1886 in 32 Upper Abbey Street, Dublin, to Patrick Traynor, bookseller, and his wife Maria Traynor (née Clarke). He was educated by at St Mary&#x27;s Place, Christian Brothers school. In 1899, he was apprenticed to John Long, a famous wood carver. Traynor later qualified as a compositor.

As a young man, he was a noted footballer and toured Europe as a goalkeeper with Belfast Celtic F.C. whom he played from 1910 to 1912. Traynor rejected claims soccer was a foreign sport calling it &quot;a Celtic game, pure and simple, having its roots in the Highlands of Scotland.&quot;

Traynor joined the Irish Volunteers and took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, being the leader of the Metropole Hotel garrison. Following this he was interned in Wales. During the Irish War of Independence, he was brigadier of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Republican Army and led the attack on The Custom House in 1921 and led a 12 man squad in an ambush on the West Kent Regiment at Claude Road, Drumcondra on 16 June 1921 when the Thompson submachine gun was fired for the first time in action. Three British soldiers were injured in that attack, one seriously. Later Traynor was promoted to command the IRA&#x27;s 1st Eastern Division.

When the Irish Civil War broke out in June 1922, Traynor took the Anti-Treaty IRA side. The Dublin Brigade was split, however, with many of its members following Michael Collins in taking the pro-Treaty side. During the Battle of Dublin he was in charge of the Barry&#x27;s Hotel garrison, before making their escape. He organised guerrilla activity in south Dublin and County Wicklow, before being captured by Free State troops in September. He was then imprisoned for the remainder of the war.

On 11 March 1925, he was elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election as a Sinn Féin TD for the Dublin North constituency, though he did not take his seat due to the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. He was re-elected as one of eight members for Dublin North in the June 1927 general election but just one of six Sinn Féin TDs. Once again, he did not take his seat. Traynor did not contest the second general election called that year but declared his support for Fianna Fáil. He stood again in the 1932 general election and was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin North.

In 1936, he was first appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In September 1939, Traynor was appointed Minister for Defence and held the portfolio until February 1948. In 1948, he became president of the Football Association of Ireland, a position he held until his death. He served as Minister for Defence in several Fianna Fáil governments and as Minister for Justice, where he was undermined by his junior minister, and later Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, before he retired in 1961.

Traynor died on 15 December 1963 in Dublin at the age of 77.

He has a road named in his memory, running from the Malahide Road through Coolock to Santry in Dublin&#x27;s northern suburbs.

<doc id="479148" wikidata="Q804265" url="?curid=479148" title="Blackburn Buccaneer">
<text>The Blackburn Buccaneer is a British carrier-capable attack aircraft designed in the 1950s for the Royal Navy (RN). Designed and initially produced by Blackburn Aircraft at Brough, it was later officially known as the Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer when Blackburn became a part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, but this name is rarely used.

The Buccaneer was originally designed in response to the Soviet Union introducing the &quot;Sverdlov&quot; class of light cruisers. Instead of building a new class of its own cruisers, the Royal Navy decided that it could address the threat posed via low-level attack runs performed by Buccaneers, so low as to exploit the ship&#x27;s radar horizon to minimise the opportunity for being fired upon. The Buccaneer could attack using nuclear weapons or conventional munitions. During its service life, it would be modified to carry anti-ship missiles, allowing it to attack vessels from a stand-off distance and thus improve its survivability against modern ship-based anti-aircraft weapons. The Buccaneer performed its maiden flight in April 1958 and entered Royal Navy service during July 1962.

Initial production aircraft suffered a series of accidents, largely due to insufficient engine power; this shortfall would be quickly addressed via the introduction of the Buccaneer S.2, equipped with more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey jet engines, in 1965. The Buccaneer S.2 would be the first Fleet Air Arm (FAA) aircraft to make a non-stop, unrefuelled crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Royal Navy standardised the air wings operating from their carriers around the Buccaneer, Phantom, and the Fairey Gannet. The Buccaneer was also offered as a possible solution for the Royal Air Force (RAF) requirement for a supersonic interdictor carrying nuclear weapons. It was rejected as not meeting the specification in favour of the more advanced BAC TSR-2 bomber, but this aircraft would be cancelled largely due to its high cost, then its selected replacement, the General Dynamics F-111K, would also be cancelled. The Buccaneer was purchased as a TSR-2 substitute and entered RAF service during October 1969.

The Royal Navy retired the last of its large aircraft carriers in February 1979; as a result, the Buccaneer&#x27;s strike role was transferred to the British Aerospace Sea Harrier and the Buccaneers were transferred to the RAF. After a crash in 1980 revealed metal fatigue problems, the RAF&#x27;s fleet was reduced to 60 aircraft while the rest were withdrawn. The ending of the Cold War in the 1990s led to military cutbacks that accelerated the retirement of Britain&#x27;s remaining Buccaneers; the last of the RAF&#x27;s Buccaneers were retired in March 1994 in favour of the more modern Panavia Tornado. The South African Air Force (SAAF) was the only export customer for the type. Buccaneers saw combat action in the first Gulf War of 1991, and the lengthy South African Border War.

==Development==
===Royal Navy===

Following the end of the Second World War, the Royal Navy soon needed to respond to the threat posed by the rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy. Chief amongst Soviet naval developments in the early 1950s was the ; these vessels were classifiable as light cruisers, being fast, effectively armed, and numerous. Like the German &quot;pocket battleships&quot; during the Second World War, these new Soviet cruisers presented a serious threat to the merchant fleets in the Atlantic. To counter this threat, the Royal Navy decided not to use a new ship class of its own, but instead introduce a specialised strike aircraft employing conventional or nuclear weapons. Operating from the Navy&#x27;s fleet carriers, and attacking at high speed and low level, it would offer a solution to the &quot;Sverdlov&quot; problem.

A detailed specification was issued in June 1952 as Naval Staff Requirement &quot;NA.39&quot;, calling for a two-seat aircraft with folding wings, capable of flying at at sea level, with a combat radius of at low altitude, and at higher cruising altitudes. A weapons load of was required, including conventional bombs, the Red Beard free-fall nuclear bomb, or the Green Cheese anti-ship missile. Based on the requirement, the Ministry of Supply issued specification &quot;M.148T&quot; in August 1952, and the first responses were returned in February 1953. Blackburn&#x27;s design by Barry P. Laight, &quot;Project B-103&quot;, won the tender in July 1955. For reasons of secrecy, the aircraft was called &quot;BNA&quot; (Blackburn Naval Aircraft) or &quot;BANA&quot; (Blackburn Advanced Naval Aircraft) in documents, leading to the nickname of &quot;Banana Jet&quot;. The first prototype made its maiden flight from RAE Bedford on 30 April 1958.

The first production Buccaneer model, the &quot;Buccaneer S.1&quot;, entered squadron service with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in January 1963. It was powered by a pair of de Havilland Gyron Junior turbojets, producing of thrust. This mark was somewhat underpowered, and as a consequence, could not achieve take off if fully laden with both fuel and armament. A temporary solution to this problem was the &quot;buddy system&quot;: aircraft took off with a full load of weaponry and minimal fuel, and would subsequently rendezvous with a Supermarine Scimitar that would deliver the full load of fuel by aerial refuelling. The lack of power meant, however, that the loss of an engine during take-off, or landing at full load, when the aircraft was dependent on flap blowing, could be catastrophic.

The long-term solution to the underpowered S.1 was the development of the &quot;Buccaneer S.2&quot;, fitted with the Rolls-Royce Spey engine, which provided 40% more thrust. The turbofan Spey also had significantly lower fuel consumption than the pure-jet Gyron, which provided improved range. The engine nacelles had to be enlarged to accommodate the Spey, and the wing required minor aerodynamic modifications as a result. Hawker Siddeley announced the production order for the S.2 in January 1962. All Royal Navy squadrons had converted to the improved S.2 by the end of 1966. However, 736 Naval Air Squadron also used eight S.1 aircraft taken from storage to meet an extra training demand for RAF crews until December 1970.

===South African Air Force===
In October 1962, 16 aircraft were ordered by the South African Air Force (SAAF), as the &quot;Buccaneer S.50&quot;. These were S.2 aircraft with the addition of Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines to provide additional thrust for the &quot;hot and high&quot; African airfields. The S.50 was also equipped with strengthened undercarriage, and higher capacity wheel brakes, and had manually folded wings. They were equipped to use the AS-30 command guided air-to-surface missiles. Due to the need to patrol the vast coastline, they also specified aerial refueling, and larger underwing tanks. Once in service, the extra thrust of the BS.605 rocket engines proved to be unnecessary, and they were eventually removed from all aircraft. South Africa later sought to procure further Buccaneers, but the British government blocked further orders, because of a voluntary arms embargo on that country.

===Royal Air Force===

Blackburn&#x27;s first attempt to sell the Buccaneer to the Royal Air Force (RAF) occurred in 1957–1958, in response to the Air Ministry Operational Requirement OR.339, for a replacement for the RAF&#x27;s English Electric Canberra light bombers, with supersonic speed, and a combat radius; asking for an all-weather aircraft that could deliver nuclear weapons over a long range, operate at high level at Mach 2+ or low level at Mach 1.2, with STOL performance. Blackburn proposed two designs, the B.103A, a simple modification of the Buccaneer S.1 with more fuel, and the B.108, a more extensively modified aircraft with more sophisticated avionics. Against a background of inter-service distrust, political issues, and the 1957 Defence White Paper, both types were rejected by the RAF; as being firmly subsonic, and incapable of meeting the RAF&#x27;s range requirements; while the B.108, which retained Gyron Junior engines while being heavier than the S.1, would have been severely underpowered, giving poor short-take off performance. The BAC TSR-2 was eventually selected in 1959.

After the cancellation of the TSR-2, and then the substitute American General Dynamics F-111K, the Royal Air Force still required a replacement for its Canberras in the low-level strike role, while the planned retirement for the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers meant that the RAF would also need to add a maritime strike capability. It was therefore decided in 1968 that the RAF would adopt the Buccaneer, both by the purchase of new-build aircraft, and by taking over the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Buccaneers as the carriers were retired. A total of 46 new-build aircraft for the RAF were built by Blackburn&#x27;s successor, Hawker Siddeley, designated &quot;S.2B&quot;. These had RAF-type communications and avionics equipment, Martel air-to-surface missile capability, and could be equipped with a bulged bomb-bay door containing an extra fuel tank.

Some Fleet Air Arm Buccaneers were modified in-service to also carry the Martel anti-ship missile. Martel-capable FAA aircraft were later redesignated &quot;S.2D&quot;. The remaining aircraft became &quot;S.2C&quot;. RAF aircraft were given various upgrades. Self-defence was improved by the addition of the AN/ALQ-101 electronic countermeasures (ECM) pod (also found on RAF&#x27;s SEPECAT Jaguar GR.3), chaff and flare dispensers, and AIM-9 Sidewinder capability. RAF low-level strike Buccaneers could carry out what was known as &#x27;retard defence&#x27;; four retarded bombs carried internally could be dropped to provide an effective deterrent against any following aircraft. In 1979, the RAF obtained the American AN/AVQ-23E Pave Spike laser designator pod for Paveway II laser-guided bombs; allowing the aircraft to act as target designators for further Buccaneers, Jaguars, and other strike aircraft. From 1986, No. 208 Squadron RAF, then No. 12 (B) Squadron, replaced the Martel ASM with the Sea Eagle missile.

===Proposed developments===
Further developments beyond the Buccaneer S.2 were put forward by Hawker Siddeley in the 1960s and 1970s; however none would be pursued through to production by either the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. One such effort was designated as &quot;Buccaneer 2*&quot;, which was presented as a cost-effective alternative to the TSR-2. The 2* would have featured newer equipment; such as head-up displays and onboard computers from the cancelled Hawker Siddeley P.1154 VTOL aircraft, it would have also adopted the same radar system as that being developed for the TSR-2. An even more extensively upgraded model, the &quot;Buccaneer 2**&quot; was also mooted, which would have been furnished with more sophisticated land-strike capabilities derived from the TSR-2 again. According to Denis Healey, defence minister 1964–1970, the RAF had been hostile to the Buccaneer due to it being a naval aircraft; it has been further suggested that developing improved Buccaneers for the RAF would weaken arguments against the Royal Navy&#x27;s planned CVA-01-class aircraft carriers. In one report by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), it was claimed that two Buccaneer 2* could do the job of one General Dynamics F-111, for less than half the unit cost.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Buccaneer was a mid-wing, twin-engine aircraft. It had a crew of two in a tandem-seat arrangement with the observer seated higher and offset from the pilot to give a clear view forwards to enable him to assist in visual search. Its operational profile included cruising at altitude (for reduced fuel consumption) before descending, just outside the anticipated enemy radar detection range, to for a dash to and from the target. Targets might be ships-at-sea or large shore-based installations at long range from the launching aircraft-carrier. To illustrate, in May 1966, an S.2 launched from in the Irish Sea, performed a low-level simulated nuclear weapon toss on the airfield at Gibraltar and returned to the ship, a trip The aircraft had an all-weather operational capability provided by the pilot&#x27;s head-up display and Airstream Direction Detector, for example, and the observer&#x27;s navigation systems and fire control radar. The Buccaneer was one of the largest aircraft to operate from British aircraft carriers, and continued operating from them until the last conventional carrier was withdrawn in February 1979. During its service, the Buccaneer was the backbone of the Navy&#x27;s ground strike operations, including nuclear strike.

The majority of the rear fuselage&#x27;s internal area was used to house electronics, such as elements of the radio, equipment supporting the aircraft&#x27;s radar functionality, and the crew&#x27;s liquid oxygen life support system; the whole compartment was actively cooled by ram air drawn from the tailfin. For redundancy, the Buccaneer featured dual busbars for electrical systems, and three independent hydraulic systems. The aircraft was made easier to control and land via an integrated flight control computer that performed auto-stabilisation and auto pilot functions.

===Armament and equipment===

The Buccaneer had been designed specifically as a maritime nuclear strike aircraft. Its intended weapon was a nuclear air-to-surface missile codenamed Green Cheese but this weapon&#x27;s development was cancelled, and in its place was the unguided Red Beard, which had been developed for the English Electric Canberra. Red Beard had an explosive yield in the 10 to 20 kiloton range; and was mounted on a special bomb bay door, into which it nested neatly to reduce aerodynamic buffet on the launch aircraft. At low levels and high speeds, traditional bomb bay doors could not be opened safely into the air stream; therefore, Blackburn developed a revolving bomb bay which turned about the long axis of the aircraft, exposing the weapon load mounted on what was effectively the inside of the single bomb bay door and allowing it to be released quickly without creating a massive increase in drag; this feature also proved convenient in providing ground-level access and unintentionally improved the aircraft&#x27;s stealth capability by not generating a large increase in the radar cross section.

The bomb bay could also accommodate a ferry tank, a photo-reconnaissance &#x27;crate&#x27;, or a cargo container. The reconnaissance package featured an assortment of six cameras, each at different angles or having different imaging properties, and was only mounted on missions specifically involving reconnaissance activities. The Buccaneer also featured four underwing hard points capable of mounting bombs, missiles, fuel tanks, or other equipment such as flares; later developments saw the adoption of wing-mounted electronic warfare and laser designator pods. A similar underwing configuration was latterly adopted by the SAAF. Upon its entry into service, the Buccaneer was capable of carrying practically all munitions then in use by Royal Navy aircraft. It was intended for a pack with twin 30 mm (1.2 in) ADEN cannons to be developed for the Buccaneer, but the effort was abandoned and the type was never equipped with a gun.

Early on in the Buccaneer&#x27;s career, conventional anti-ship missions would have employed a mix of unguided bombs and rockets at close range. This tactic became increasingly impractical in the face of Soviet anti-aircraft missile advances; thus, later Buccaneers were adapted to make use of several missiles capable of striking enemy ships from a distance. The Anglo-French Martel missile was introduced upon the Buccaneer, but the weapon was said to have been &quot;very temperamental&quot;, and its deployment required an attacking Buccaneer to increase its altitude and thus its vulnerability to being attacked itself. An extensive upgrade programme undertaken in the 1980s added compatibility with several new pieces of equipment; including the Sea Eagle missile, a self-guiding &#x27;fire-and-forget&#x27; missile capable of striking targets at an effective range of , five times that of the Martel AJ 168 anti-ship missile, while also being significantly more powerful.

===Boundary layer control===

In order to dramatically improve aerodynamic performance at slow speeds, such as during takeoff and landing, Blackburn adopted a new aerodynamic control technology, known as boundary layer control (BLC). BLC bled high-pressure air directly from the engines, which was &quot;blown&quot; against various parts of the aircraft&#x27;s wing surfaces and horizontal stabiliser. A full-span slit along the part of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge was found to give almost 50% more lift than any contemporary scheme. In order to counteract the severe pitch movements that would otherwise be generated by use of BLC, a self-trimming system was interconnected with the BLC system, and additional blowing of the wing&#x27;s leading edge was also introduced. The use of BLC allowed the use of slats to be entirely discarded in the design.

Before landing, the pilot would open the BLC vents as well as lower the flaps to achieve slow, stable flight. A consequence of the blown wing was that the engines were required to run at high power for low-speed flight in order to generate sufficient compressor gas for blowing. Blackburn&#x27;s solution to this situation was the adoption of a large air brake; this addition also allowed an overshooting aircraft to pull away more quickly during a failed landing attempt. The nose cone and radar antenna could also be swung around by 180 degrees to reduce the length of the aircraft in the carrier hangar. This feature was particularly important due to the small size of the aircraft carriers from which the Buccaneer typically operated.

For a carrier take-off, the Buccaneer was pulled tail-down on the catapult, with its nosewheel in the air to put the wing at about 11°. It could be launched &quot;hands-off&quot;: the pilot able to leave the tailplane in a neutral position. With blowing on, the Spey 101 output drops to around , though about is recovered from the trailing edge slits which face aft. About 70% of the blown air goes over the flaps and ailerons, which are in a drooped position. Off an aircraft carrier, the minimum launch speed was around at ; from an airfield, the Buccaneer took off in at with blown air. The figures become at without blown air.

===Fuselage and structure===

The fuselage of the Buccaneer was designed using the area rule technique, which had the effect of reducing aerodynamic drag while travelling at transonic speeds, and gave rise to the characteristic curvy &quot;Coke bottle&quot; shape of the fuselage. The majority of the airframe and fuselage was machined from solid castings to give the required strength to endure the stress of low-level operations. Considerable effort went into ensuring that metal fatigue would not be a limiting factor of the Buccaneer&#x27;s operational life, even under the formidable conditions imposed of low level flight. However, design changes for the Mark 2 Buccaneer, the addition of extended wingtips and the position of a new bolt hole, did cause fatigue problems leading to the loss of two aircraft.

A large air brake formed the tail-cone of the aircraft. The hydraulically operated air brake formed two leaves that could be opened into the airstream to quickly decelerate the aircraft. The style of air brake chosen by Blackburn was highly effective in the dive-attack profile that the Buccaneer was intended to perform, as well as effectively balancing out induced drag from operating the BLC system. It featured a variable incidence tailplane that could be trimmed to suit the particular requirements of low-speed handling, or high-speed flight; the tailplane had to be high mounted due to the positioning and functionality of the Buccaneer&#x27;s air brake.

The wing design of the Buccaneer was a compromise between two requirements: a low-aspect ratio for good gust response, and high-aspect ratio to give good range performance. The small wing was suited to high-speed flight at low altitude; however, a small wing did not generate sufficient lift that was essential for carrier operations. Therefore, BLC was used upon both the wing and tailplane, having the effect of energising and smoothing the boundary layer airflow, which significantly reduced airflow separation at the back of the wing, and therefore decreased stall speed, and increased effectiveness of trailing edge control surfaces, including flaps and ailerons. To extend the Buccaneer&#x27;s operating life during the 1980s, it was deemed necessary to replace the original new spar rings on those aircraft that were retained.

==Operational history==
===Fleet Air Arm===
The Buccaneer entered service with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) on 17 July 1962, when 801 NAS was commissioned at RNAS Lossiemouth in Scotland. The Buccaneer quickly replaced the FAA&#x27;s Supermarine Scimitar, which had previously been performing the naval attack role. In addition to conventional ordnance, the Buccaneer was cleared for nuclear weapons delivery in 1965; weapons deployed included Red Beard and WE.177 free-fall bombs, which were carried internally on a rotating bomb-bay door. Two FAA operational squadrons, and a training unit were equipped with the Buccaneer S.1. The aircraft was well liked by Navy aircrew for its strength and flying qualities, and the BLC system gave them slower landing speeds than they were accustomed to. The Buccaneers were painted dark sea grey on top, and anti-flash white on the undersides.

Deficiences in the Buccaneer S.1&#x27;s Gyron Junior engines led to the type&#x27;s career coming to an abrupt end in December 1970. On 1 December, an S.1 attempted to overshoot from a misjudged landing approach but one engine surged and produced no thrust, forcing the two crewmen to eject. On 8 December, an S.1 on a training flight suffered a massive uncontained engine failure. The pilot successfully ejected, but due to a mechanical failure in his ejection seat the navigator was killed. Subsequent inspections concluded that the Gyron Junior engine was no longer safe to fly. All remaining S.1s were grounded immediately and permanently.
By April 1965, intensive trials of the new Buccaneer S.2 had begun, with the type entering operational service with the FAA later that year. The improved S.2 type proved its value when it became the first FAA aircraft to make a non-stop, unrefuelled crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. On 28 March 1967, Buccaneers from RNAS Lossiemouth bombed the shipwrecked supertanker off the western coast of Cornwall to make the oil burn in an attempt to avoid an environmental disaster. In 1972, Buccaneers of 809 Naval Air Squadron operating from took part in a mission to show a military presence over British Honduras (now Belize) shortly before its independence, to deter a possible Guatemalan invasion in pursuit of its territorial claims over the country.

The Buccaneer also participated in regular patrols and exercises in the North Sea, practising the type&#x27;s role if war had broken out with the Soviet Union. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Royal Navy standardised the air wings operating from their carriers around the Phantom, Buccaneer, and the Fairey Gannet aircraft. A total of six FAA squadrons were equipped with the Buccaneer: 700B/700Z (intensive flying trials unit), 736 (training), 800, 801, 803 and 809 Naval Air Squadrons. Buccaneers were embarked on HMS &quot;Victorious&quot;, , HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and .

The Buccaneer was retired from FAA service with the decommissioning in February 1979 of the &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the last of the navy&#x27;s fleet carriers. Their retirement was part of a larger foreign policy agenda that was implemented throughout the 1970s. Measures such as the withdrawal of most British military forces stationed East of Suez were viewed as reducing the need for aircraft carriers, and fixed-wing naval aviation in general. The decision was highly controversial, particularly to those within the FAA. The Royal Navy would replace the naval strike capability of the Buccaneer with the smaller V/STOL-capable British Aerospace Sea Harrier, which were operated from their s.

===Royal Air Force===
After the General Dynamics F-111K was cancelled in early 1968, due to the programme suffering serious cost escalation and delays, the RAF was forced to look for a replacement that was available and affordable, and reluctantly selected the Buccaneer. The first RAF unit to receive the Buccaneer was 12 Squadron at RAF Honington in October 1969, in the maritime strike role, at first equipped with ex-Royal Navy Buccaneer S.2As. This was to remain a key station for the type, as 15 Squadron equipped with the Buccaneer the following year, before moving to RAF Laarbruch in 1971, and the RAF Buccaneer conversion unit, No. 237 Operational Conversion Unit RAF, forming at Honington in March 1971. The Buccaneer was seen as an interim solution, but delays in the Panavia Tornado programme would ensure that the &#x27;interim&#x27; period would stretch out, and the Buccaneer would remain in RAF service for over two decades, long after the FAA had given up the type.
With the phased withdrawal of the Royal Navy&#x27;s carrier fleet during the 1970s, the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Buccaneers were transferred to the RAF, which had taken over the maritime strike role. 62 of the 84 S.2 aircraft were eventually transferred, redesignated &quot;S.2A&quot;; some of these were later upgraded to S.2B standard. Ex-FAA aircraft equipped 16 Squadron, joining 15 Squadron at RAF Laarbruch, and 208 Squadron at Honington; the last ex-FAA aircraft went to 216 Squadron shortly before its disbandment.

From 1970, with 12 Squadron initially, followed by 15 Squadron, 16 Squadron, No. 237 OCU, 208 Squadron, and 216 Squadron, the RAF Buccaneer force re-equipped with WE.177 nuclear weapons. At peak strength, Buccaneers equipped six RAF squadrons, although for only a year. A more sustained strength of five squadrons was made up of three squadrons (15 Squadron, 16 Squadron, 208 Squadron), plus No. 237 OCU (a war reserve or Shadow squadron), all assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for land strike duties in support of land forces opposing Warsaw Pact forces in continental Europe, plus one squadron (12 Squadron) assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) for maritime strike duties.

Opportunities for Buccaneer squadrons to engage in realistic training were limited, and so when the US began its Red Flag military exercises at Nellis Air Force Base in 1975, the RAF became keenly interested. The first Red Flag in which RAF aircraft were involved was in 1977, with 10 Buccaneers and two Avro Vulcan bombers participating. Buccaneers would be involved in later Red Flags through to 1983, and in 1979, also participated in the similar Maple Flag exercise over Canada. The Buccaneer proved successful with its fast low-level attacks, which were highly accurate despite the lack of terrain-following radar and other modern avionics.
During the 1980 Red Flag exercises, one of the participating Buccaneers lost a wing mid-flight due to a fatigue-induced crack and crashed, killing its crew. The entire RAF Buccaneer fleet was grounded in February 1980; subsequent investigation discovered serious metal fatigue problems to be present on numerous aircraft. A total of 60 aircraft were selected to receive new spar rings, while others were scrapped; the nascent 216 Squadron was subsequently disbanded due to a resulting reduction in aircraft numbers. Later the same year, the UK-based Buccaneer squadrons moved to RAF Lossiemouth in order to free space at Honington for the Tornado.

In 1983, six Buccaneer S.2s were sent to Cyprus to support British peacekeepers in Lebanon as a part of Operation Pulsator. On 11 September 1983, two of these aircraft flew low over Beirut, their presence intended to intimidate insurgents, rather than inflict damage directly. After 1983, the land strike duties were mostly reassigned to the Tornado aircraft then entering service, and two Buccaneer squadrons remaining (12 Squadron, and 208 Squadron) were then assigned to SACLANT for maritime strike duties. Only the &#x27;Shadow Squadron&#x27;, No. 237 OCU, remained assigned to the role of land strike on long term assignment to SACEUR, No. 237 was also to operate as a designator for Jaguar ground strike aircraft in the event of conflict. The Buccaneer stood down from its reserve nuclear delivery duties in 1991.

The Buccaneer took part in combat operations during the 1991 Gulf War. It had been anticipated that Buccaneers might need to perform in the target designation role, although early on, this had been thought to be &quot;unlikely&quot;. Following a short-notice decision to deploy, the first batch of six aircraft were readied to deploy in under 72 hours, including the adoption of desert camouflage, and additional equipment, and departed from Lossiemouth for the Middle Eastern theatre early on 26 January 1991. In theatre, it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carried a single laser designator pod, and acted as backup to the other in the event of an equipment malfunction. The first combat mission took place on 2 February, operating at a medium altitude of roughly , and successfully attacked the As Suwaira Road Bridge.
Operations continued on practically every available day; missions did not take place at night as the laser pod lacked night-time functionality. Approximately 20 road bridges were destroyed by Buccaneer-supported missions, restricting the Iraqi Army&#x27;s mobility and communications. In conjunction with the advance of Coalition ground forces into Iraq, the Buccaneers switched to airfield bombing missions, targeting bunkers, runways, and any aircraft sighted; following the guidance of the Tornado&#x27;s laser-guided ordnance, the Buccaneers would commonly conduct dive-bombing runs upon remaining targets of opportunity in the vicinity. In one incident on 21 February 1991, a pair of Buccaneers destroyed two Iraqi transport aircraft on the ground at Shayka Mazhar airfield. The Buccaneers flew 218 missions during the Gulf War, in which they designated targets for other aircraft, and dropped 48 laser-guided bombs.

It had originally been planned for the Buccaneer to remain in service until the end of the 1990s, having been extensively modernized in a process lasting up to 1989; the end of the Cold War stimulated major changes in British defence policy, many aircraft being deemed to be surplus to requirements. It was decided that a number of Tornado GR1s would be modified for compatibility with the Sea Eagle missile, and take over the RAF&#x27;s maritime strike mission, and the Buccaneer would be retired early. Squadrons operating the Buccaneer were quickly re-equipped with the Tornado; by mid-1993, 208 Squadron was the sole remaining operator of the type. The last Buccaneers were withdrawn in March 1994, when 208 Squadron disbanded.

===South African Air Force===
South Africa was the only country other than the UK to operate the Buccaneer, where it was in service with the SAAF from 1965 to 1991. In January 1963, even before the S.2 entered squadron service, South Africa had purchased 16 Spey-powered Buccaneers. The order was part of the Simonstown Agreement, in which the UK obtained use of the Simonstown naval base in South Africa, in exchange for maritime weapons. An order for a further 20 Buccaneers was blocked by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s government.

In the maritime strike role, SAAF Buccaneers were armed with the French radio-guided AS-30 missile. In March 1971, Buccaneers fired 12 AS-30s at a stricken tanker, the &quot;Wafra&quot;, but failed to sink it. The AS-30 missile was also used in ground attacks for effective precision strikes, one example being in 1981, when multiple missiles were used to strike a number of radar stations in southern Angola. For overland attack, the SAAF Buccaneers carried up to four bombs in the rotary bomb bay, and four bombs, flares, or SNEB rocket packs on the underwing stores pylons. During the 1990s, it was revealed that South Africa had manufactured six air-deliverable tactical nuclear weapons between 1978 and 1993. These nuclear weapons, containing highly enriched uranium, with an estimated explosion yield of 10-18 kilotons, were designed for delivery by either the Buccaneer or the Canberra bomber.

SAAF Buccaneers saw active service in the 1970s and 1980s during the South African Border War, frequently flying over Angola and Namibia, launching attacks upon SWAPO guerilla camps. During a ground offensive, Buccaneers would often fly close air support (CAS) missions armed with anti-personnel rockets, as well as performing bombardment operations. Buccaneers played a major role in the Battle of Cassinga in 1978, being employed in repeated strikes upon armoured vehicles, including enemy tanks, and to cover the withdrawal of South African and alligned ground forces from the combat zone. The Buccaneer was capable of carrying heavy load outs over a long range, and could remain in theatre for longer than other aircraft, making it attractive for the CAS role. On 3 January 1988, Buccaneers of the SADF destroyed the important bridge across the Cuito River using a Raptor glide bomb, following on from a less successful attempt on 12 December 1987. Only five aircraft remained operational by the time the Buccaneer was retired from service in 1991.

===Others===
Early in the Buccaneer programme, the United States Navy had expressed mild interest in the aircraft, but quickly moved on to the development of its comparable Grumman A-6 Intruder. The West German Navy showed a greater interest, and considered replacing its Hawker Sea Hawks with the type, although it eventually decided on the Lockheed F-104G for its maritime strike requirement.

===Civil operators===
At one point, three privately owned Buccaneers were being operated at Thunder City. After Thunder City closed all three aircraft were sold to Hangar 51 Aviation in late 2021. The Buccaneers were transported by road to Gqeberha in December 2022 where Hangar 51 Aviation was intending to restore them.

==Surviving aircraft==

In the United Kingdom, Buccaneer S.2 &quot;XX885&quot; has been rebuilt to flying condition by Hawker Hunter Aviation. It was granted UK CAA permission to fly in April 2006.

Five Buccaneers in the UK (XN923, XN974, XW544, XX894 and XX900) are in fast taxiing condition.

<doc id="479151" wikidata="Q3180238" url="?curid=479151" title="Arrow Air Flight 1285R">
<text>Arrow Air Flight 1285R was an international charter flight carrying U.S. Army personnel from Cairo, Egypt, to their home base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, via Cologne, West Germany, and Gander, Newfoundland. On the morning of Thursday, 12 December 1985, shortly after takeoff from Canada&#x27;s Gander International Airport en route to Fort Campbell, the McDonnell Douglas DC-8 serving the flight stalled, crashed, and burned about half a mile from the runway, killing all 248 passengers and 8 crew members on board. , it is the deadliest aviation accident to occur on Canadian soil. At the time of the crash, it was the deadliest aviation accident involving a DC-8; its death toll was surpassed by the crash of Nigeria Airways Flight 2120 nearly six years later.

The accident was investigated by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB), which determined that the probable cause of the crash was the aircraft&#x27;s unexpectedly high drag and reduced lift condition, most likely due to ice contamination on the wings&#x27; leading edges and upper surfaces, as well as underestimated onboard weight. A minority report stated that the accident could have been caused by an onboard explosion of unknown origin before impact, with one of these dissenting investigators later telling a United States congressional committee that a thin layer of ice could not bring down the aircraft. The dissenting report led to delays in changes to de-icing procedures, and a thin layer of ice caused the deadly crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363 in Canada in 1989.

In response to lack of confidence in accident investigations by the CASB, the Government of Canada shut the board down in 1990, replacing it with an independent, multi-modal investigative agency – the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

==Flight history==
The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63CF, was chartered to carry U.S. Army personnel, all but 12 of them members of the 101st Airborne Division, back to their base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. They had completed a six-month deployment in the Sinai, in the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping mission. The DC-8 involved in the accident (registration was manufactured in 1969, and was first delivered to Eastern Air Lines and then leased to other airlines before being leased to Arrow Air under its owner/parent company, International Air Leases.

The flight was made up of three legs, with refuelling stops in Cologne and Gander. The aircraft departed Cairo at 20:35 UTC on Wednesday 11 December 1985, and arrived at Cologne on Thursday 12 December 1985, at 01:21 UTC.

A new flight crew, consisting of Captain John Griffin and First Officer Joseph Connelly (both 45), and Flight Engineer Michael Fowler (48), boarded the aircraft before it departed for Gander at 02:50 UTC. The aircraft arrived at Gander International Airport at 09:04, where passengers departed the aircraft while the aircraft was refuelled. Witnesses reported that the flight engineer conducted an external inspection of the aircraft, after which the passengers re-boarded the aircraft.

The DC-8 began its takeoff roll on runway 22 from the intersection of runway 13 at 10:15 UTC (06:45 NST). It rotated near taxiway A, 51 seconds after brake release, at an airspeed of about IAS. Witnesses reported the aircraft showed difficulty gaining altitude after rotation. Once airborne, the airspeed reached IAS before decreasing again, causing the DC-8 to descend. After crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, located about from the departure end of runway 22, at a very low altitude, the aircraft&#x27;s pitch increased, and it continued to descend.

Witnesses driving on the highway stated that they saw a bright glow emanating from the aircraft before it struck terrain just short of Gander Lake and crashed approximately beyond the departure end of the runway. Flight 1285R broke up, struck an unoccupied building and exploded; this started an intense fire fed by the large amount of fuel carried on board for the final leg of the flight. All 248 passengers and 8 crew perished.

==Investigation==
The Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) investigated the crash and, in a report signed by five of its nine board members, found that during its approach toward Gander, precipitation conditions were favourable for the formation of ice on the aircraft&#x27;s wings. After landing, it continued to be exposed to &quot;freezing and frozen precipitation capable of producing roughening on the wing upper surface&quot; in addition to the freezing temperature. They also found that prior to takeoff the aircraft had not been de-iced. The board issued the following probable cause statement in its final report:

The Canadian Aviation Safety Board was unable to determine the exact sequence of events that led to this accident. The Board believes, however, that the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, shortly after lift-off, the aircraft experienced an increase in drag and reduction in lift that resulted in a stall at low altitude from which recovery was not possible. The most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice contamination on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing. Other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the number four engine and inappropriate takeoff reference speeds may have compounded the effects of the contamination.

Four (of nine) members of the CASB dissented, issuing a minority opinion asserting that there was no evidence presented proving that ice had been present on leading edges such as the wings, and the minority report speculated that &quot;An in-flight fire that may have resulted from detonations of undetermined origin brought about catastrophic system failures.&quot;

The report also noted the inadequacy of the data from the antiquated foil-tape flight data recorder, which recorded only airspeed, altitude, heading, and vertical acceleration forces. The plane also took off with a non-functioning cockpit area microphone. There were no steps on any of the standard checklists to test the microphone&#x27;s functionality, despite the existence of a button in the cockpit for that sole purpose. The defect went undetected for an indeterminate number of flights leading up to the accident flight, and thus the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) did not record any useful data.

The main final report is 95 pages long while the minority report is only 14 pages long. The main report has overwhelming support in evidence produced by the 31 investigators working on the crash for 3 years. The minority report on the other hand consists of multiple hypotheses supported solely by witness statements and improbable claims with very little supporting evidence that were deemed unreliable and dismissed by experienced investigators.

Willard Estey, a former Supreme Court of Canada judge, submitted a review of the CASB report in 1989, ruling that the available evidence did not support either conclusion. Estey reviewed the report from the perspective of beyond a reasonable doubt as per a court of law rather than based on the available evidence as how investigators make their conclusions. As a result, the Canadian public&#x27;s confidence in the CASB was undermined. The federal government responded by creating the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

==Aftermath==


On the day of the crash, responsibility was claimed by the Islamic Jihad Organization (de-facto part of Hezballah). Islamic Jihad had already claimed responsibility for the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings that killed more than 200 American Marines. The claim was dismissed by the Canadian and U.S. governments soon after. According to United Press International, &quot;Hours after the crash the Islamic Jihad – a Shiite Muslim extremist group – claimed it destroyed the plane to prove [its] ability to strike at the Americans anywhere.&quot; Pentagon and Canadian government officials rejected the claim, made by an anonymous caller to a French news agency in Beirut.

The death toll of all 256 people on board – 248 U.S. servicemen and 8 crew members, still constitutes the deadliest plane crash in Canada, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s single deadliest air crash in peacetime.

Of the 248 servicemen, all but twelve were members of 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), most of whom were from the 3d Battalion, 502nd Infantry; eleven were from other Forces Command units; and one was an agent from the Criminal Investigations Command (CID).

A memorial to the 256 victims at the crash site overlooks Gander Lake, and another memorial was erected at Fort Campbell. There is also a Memorial Park in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, just north of Fort Campbell. , the scar from the crash is still visible from the ground and by satellite.

The dissenting report led to delays in changes to de-icing procedures, later made after a thin layer of ice caused the deadly crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363 in Canada in 1989. In response to lack of confidence in accident investigations by the CASB, the government of Canada shut down the board in 1990, replacing it with an independent, multi-modal investigative agency – the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

==In popular culture==
The television documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot; featured the Flight 1285R crash and investigation in a season 11 episode titled &quot;Split Decision&quot;, which included interviews with accident investigators and a dramatic recreation of the accident.

<text>The police procedural, police show, or police crime drama is a subgenre of procedural drama and detective fiction that emphasises the investigative procedure of police officers, police detectives, or law enforcement agencies as the protagonists, as contrasted with other genres that focus on non-police investigators such as private investigators (PIs).

As its name implies, the defining element of a police procedural is the attempt to accurately depict law enforcement and its procedures, including police-related topics such as forensic science, autopsies, gathering evidence, search warrants, interrogation, and adherence to legal restrictions and procedures.

While many police procedurals conceal the criminal&#x27;s identity until the crime is solved in the narrative climax (the so-called whodunit), others reveal the perpetrator&#x27;s identity to the audience early in the narrative, making it an inverted detective story.

The police procedural genre has faced criticism for its inaccurate depictions of policing and crime, depictions of racism and sexism, and allegations that the genre is &quot;copaganda&quot;, or promotes a one-sided depiction of police as the &quot;good guys&quot;.

==Early history==
The roots of the police procedural have been traced to at least the mid-1880s. Wilkie Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), a tale of a Scotland Yard detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the genre.

As detective fiction rose to worldwide popularity in the late 19th century and early 20th century, many of the pioneering and most popular characters, at least in the English-speaking world, were private investigators or amateurs. See C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade, Miss Marple and others. Hercule Poirot was described as a veteran of the Belgian police, but as a protagonist he worked independently. Only after World War II would police procedural fiction rival the popularity of PIs or amateur sleuths.

Lawrence Treat&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;V as in Victim&quot; is often cited as the first police procedural, by Anthony Boucher (mystery critic for the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;) among others. Another early example is Hillary Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Last Seen Wearing...&quot; 1952. Even earlier examples from the 20th century, predating Treat, include the novels &quot;Vultures in the Dark&quot;, 1925, and &quot;The Borrowed Shield&quot;, 1925, by Richard Enright, retired New York City Police Commissioner, &quot;Harness Bull&quot;, 1937, and &quot;Homicide&quot;, 1937, by former Southern California police officer Leslie T. White, &quot;P.C. Richardson&#x27;s First Case&quot;, 1933, by Sir Basil Thomson, former Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, and the short story collection &quot;Policeman&#x27;s Lot&quot;, 1933, by former Buckinghamshire High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace Henry Wade.

The procedural became more prominent after World War II, and, while the contributions of novelists like Treat were significant, a large part of the impetus for the post-war development of the procedural as a distinct subgenre of the mystery was due, not to prose fiction, but to the popularity of a number of American films which dramatized and fictionalized actual crimes. Dubbed &quot;semidocumentary films&quot; by film critics, these motion pictures, often filmed on location, with the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies involved in the actual case, made a point of authentically depicting police work. Examples include &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948), &quot;The Street with No Name&quot; (1948), &quot;T-Men&quot; (1947), &quot;He Walked by Night&quot; (1948), and &quot;Border Incident&quot; (1949).

Films from other countries soon began following the semi-documentary trend. In France, there was &quot;Quai des orfevres&quot; (1947), released in the United States as &quot;Jenny Lamour&quot;. In Japanese cinema, there was Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;Stray Dog&quot;, a serious police procedural film noir that was also a precursor to the buddy cop film genre. In the UK, there were films such as &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Long Arm&quot; (1956) set in London and depicting the Metropolitan Police.

One semidocumentary, &quot;He Walked By Night&quot; (1948), released by Eagle-Lion Films, featured a young radio actor named Jack Webb in a supporting role. The success of the film, along with a suggestion from LAPD Detective Sergeant Marty Wynn, the film&#x27;s technical advisor, gave Webb an idea for a radio drama that depicted police work in a similarly semi-documentary manner. The resulting series, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, which debuted on radio in 1949 and made the transition to television in 1951, has been called &quot;the most famous procedural of all time&quot; by mystery novelists William L. DeAndrea, Katherine V. Forrest and Max Allan Collins.

The same year that &quot;Dragnet&quot; debuted on radio, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s stage play &quot;Detective Story&quot; opened on Broadway. This frank, carefully researched dramatization of a typical day in an NYPD precinct detective squad became another benchmark in the development of the police procedural.

&quot;Dragnet&quot; marked a turn in the depiction of the police on screen. Instead of being corrupt laughingstocks, this was the first time police officers represented bravery and heroism. In their quest for authenticity, &quot;Dragnet&quot;&#x27;s producers used real police cars and officers in their scenes. However, this also meant that in exchange, the LAPD could vet scripts for authenticity. The LAPD vetted every scene, which would allow them to remove elements they did not agree with or did not wish to draw attention to.

Over the next few years, the number of novelists who picked up on the procedural trend following &quot;Dragnet&quot;&#x27;s example grew to include writers like Ben Benson, who wrote carefully researched novels about the Massachusetts State Police, retired police officer Maurice Procter, who wrote a series about North England cop Harry Martineau, and Jonathan Craig, who wrote short stories and novels about New York City police officers. Police novels by writers who would come to virtually define the form, like Hillary Waugh, Ed McBain, and John Creasey started to appear regularly.

In 1956, in his regular &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; column, mystery critic Anthony Boucher, noting the growing popularity of crime fiction in which the main emphasis was the realistic depiction of police work, suggested that such stories constituted a distinct subgenre of the mystery, and, crediting the success of &quot;Dragnet&quot; for the rise of this new form, coined the phrase &quot;police procedural&quot; to describe it.

As police procedurals became increasingly popular, they maintained this image of heroic police officers who are willing to bend the rules to save the day, as well as the use of police consultants. This would allow Hollywood to form a friendly relationship with law enforcement who are also responsible for granting shooting permits. This, however, has garnered criticisms.

==Written stories==

=== French &quot;roman policier&quot; ===
French &quot;romans policiers&quot; (fr) value induction over deduction, synthesis of character over analysis of crime.
*1866: Émile Gaboriau: Monsieur Lecoq
*1905: Maurice Leblanc: Arsène Lupin
*1908: Gaston Leroux: Joseph Rouletabille
*1931: Georges Simenon: Inspector Maigret
*1949: Frédéric Dard: &quot;San-Antonio&quot;

===1931: Georges Simenon===
The &quot;Inspector Maigret&quot; novels of Georges Simenon feature a strong focus on the lead character, but the novels have always included subordinate members of his staff as supporting characters. Simenon, who had been a journalist covering police investigations before creating Maigret, gave the appearance of an accurate depiction of law enforcement in Paris. Simenon influenced later European procedural writers, such as Sweden&#x27;s Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, and Baantjer.

===1940: John Creasey/J. J. Marric===
Perhaps ranking just behind McBain in importance to the development of the procedural as a distinct mystery subgenre is John Creasey, a prolific writer of many different kinds of crime fiction, from espionage to criminal protagonist. He was inspired to write a more realistic crime novel when his neighbor, a retired Scotland Yard detective, challenged Creasey to &quot;write about us as we are&quot;. The result was &quot;Inspector West Takes Charge&quot;, 1940, the first of more than forty novels to feature Roger West of the London Metropolitan Police. The West novels were, for the era, an unusually realistic look at Scotland Yard operations, but the plots were often wildly melodramatic, and, to get around thorny legal problems, Creasey gave West an &quot;amateur detective&quot; friend who was able to perform the extra-procedural acts that West, as a policeman, could not.

In the mid-1950s, inspired by the success of television&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; and a similar British TV series, &quot;Fabian of the Yard&quot;, Creasey decided to try a more down-to-earth series of cop stories. Adopting the pseudonym &quot;J.J. Marric&quot;, he wrote &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day&quot;, 1955, in which George Gideon, a high-ranking detective at Scotland Yard, spends a busy day supervising his subordinates&#x27; investigations into several unrelated crimes. This novel was the first in a series of more than twenty books which brought Creasey his best critical notices. One entry, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Fire&quot;, 1961, won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Mystery Novel. The Gideon series, more than any other source, helped establish the common procedural plot structure of threading several autonomous story lines through a single novel.

=== 1952: Hillary Waugh ===
Hillary Waugh, in 1952, wrote &quot;Last Seen Wearing ...&quot;, a commercial and critical success, exploring detailed and relentless police work.

===1956: Ed McBain===
Ed McBain, the pseudonym of Evan Hunter, wrote dozens of novels in the &quot;87th Precinct&quot; series beginning with &quot;Cop Hater,&quot; published in 1956. Hunter continued to write 87th Precinct novels almost until his death in 2005. Although these novels focus primarily on Detective Steve Carella, they encompass the work of many officers working alone and in teams, and Carella is not always present in any individual book.

As if to illustrate the universality of the police procedural, many of McBain&#x27;s 87th Precinct novels, despite their being set in a slightly fictionalized New York City, have been filmed in settings outside New York, even outside the US. Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1963 film, &quot;High and Low&quot;, based on McBain&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (1959), is set in Yokohama. &quot;Without Apparent Motive&quot; (1972), set on the French Riviera, is based on McBain&#x27;s &quot;Ten Plus One&quot; (1963). Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Les Liens de Sang&quot; (1978), based on &quot;Blood Relatives&quot; (1974), is set in Montreal. Even &quot;Fuzz&quot; (1972), based on the 1968 novel, though set in the US, moves the action to Boston. Two episodes of ABC&#x27;s Columbo, set in Los Angeles, were based on McBain novels.

===1960: Elizabeth Linington/Dell Shannon/Lesley Egan===
A prolific author of police procedurals, whose work has fallen out of fashion in the years since her death, is Elizabeth Linington writing under her own name, as well as &quot;Dell Shannon&quot; and &quot;Lesley Egan&quot;. Linington reserved her Dell Shannon pseudonym primarily for procedurals featuring LAPD Central Homicide Lieutenant Luis Mendoza (1960–86). Under her own name she wrote about Sergeant Ivor Maddox of LAPD&#x27;s North Hollywood Station, and as Lesley Egan she wrote about suburban cop Vic Varallo. These novels are sometimes considered flawed, partly due to the author&#x27;s far-right political viewpoint (she was a member of the John Birch Society), but primarily because Miss Linington&#x27;s books, notwithstanding the frequent comments she made about the depth of her research, were all seriously deficient in the single element most identified with the police procedural, technical accuracy. However, they have a certain charm in their depiction of a kinder, gentler California, where the police were always &quot;good guys&quot; who solved all the crimes and respected the citizenry.

===1965: Sjöwall and Wahlöö===
Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö planned and wrote the Martin Beck police procedural series of ten books between the 1960s and 1970s, set in Sweden. The series is particularly renowned for its extensive character development throughout the series. Beck himself is gradually promoted from detective in a newly nationalised Swedish police force to Chief Inspector of the National Murder Squad, and the realistic depiction, as well as criticism of the Swedish welfare state at the time whilst the tedium of the police procedural continues in the background, is something still widely used today, with authors such as Jo Nesbø and Stieg Larsson. The books gave rise to the Swedish noir scene, and &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; earned a &quot;Best Novel&quot; Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1971. The books were translated from Swedish into 35 different languages, and have sold roughly ten million copies. Sjöwall and Wahlöö used black humour extensively in the series, and it is widely recognised as one of the finest police procedural series.

===1970: Tony Hillerman===
Tony Hillerman, the author of 17 novels involving Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, wrote procedurals in which the procedures were those of the Navajo Tribal Police.

===1971: Joseph Wambaugh===
Though not the first police officer to write procedurals, Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s success has caused him to become the exemplar of cops who turn their professional experiences into fiction. The son of a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, policeman, Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department after a stint of military duty. In 1970, his first novel, &quot;The New Centurions&quot;, was published. This followed three police officers through their training in the academy, their first few years on the street, culminating in the Watts riots of 1965. It was followed by such novels as &quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, 1971, &quot;The Choirboys&quot;, 1975, &quot;Hollywood Station&quot;, 2006, and acclaimed non-fiction books like &quot;The Onion Field&quot;, 1973, &quot;Lines and Shadows&quot;, 1984, and &quot;Fire Lover&quot;, 2002. Wambaugh has said that his main purpose is less to show how cops work on the job, than how the job works on cops.

===Detective novel writers===
It is difficult to disentangle the early roots of the procedural from its forebear, the traditional detective novel, which often featured a police officer as protagonist. By and large, the better known novelists such as Ngaio Marsh produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or &quot;cozy&quot; detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like Freeman Wills Crofts&#x27;s novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of G.D.H. and Margaret Cole, might be considered as the antecedents of today&#x27;s police procedural. British mystery novelist and critic Julian Symons, in his 1972 history of crime fiction, &quot;Bloody Murder&quot;, labeled these proto-procedurals &quot;humdrums&quot;, because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators.

====Austria====
* &quot;Inspector Rex&quot; (1994–2003) is an Austrian homicide detective series a German Shepherd police dog named Rex and his owner, Detective-Inspector Richard Moser of the Vienna Criminal Police. Rex was a bomb squad dog whose handler was killed at a crime scene that Moser was investigating. Moser&#x27;s team consisted of Ernst Stockinger (seasons 1 and 2), and Peter Hollerer (seasons 1 to 4), and Christian Bock (seasons 3 to 6). Dr Leo Graf served as forensic pathologist/coroner throughout the series, who often described autopsy scenes and procedures much to the disgust of the police staff. Moser was murdered by a psychotic serial killer halfway through season 4. Detective Inspector Alexander Brandtner took over Moser&#x27;s role after his untimely death.
:Rex frequently saved the team&#x27;s necks during pursuits and catching criminals, sniffing out clues, rescuing child victims, as well as occasionally being a nuisance around the office or while interviewing suspects. The show mixes serious themes with occasional comedy, such as Rex&#x27;s penchant for ham rolls (wurstsemmeln), demanding to buy many dog toys, and interfering with Moser&#x27;s and Brandtner&#x27;s erratic love lives.

====United Kingdom====
* &quot;Fabian of the Yard&quot;, (1954–55) – possibly the first police drama to be made for British TV, this series, based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian, had a lot in common with &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Just as &quot;Dragnet&quot; had been the first network drama series with continuing characters to be shot on film, so &quot;Fabian of the Yard&quot; was one of the first British series to be filmed. Both shows featured voice-over narration by the main character; both fictionalized stories derived from real-life cases; and both ended with an epilogue that revealed the ultimate fate of the criminals. On &quot;Fabian&quot;, this took the form of a medium-shot of Bruce Seton, who played Fabian in the series, seated at a desk. The shot slowly dissolved into one of the real-life Fabian in the same pose at the same desk. At that point, the actual Fabian stood up and told the audience what happened to the criminal he&#x27;d caught in the real-life case that had just been dramatized.
* &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, (1955–76) – Jack Warner reprised the role of Constable George Dixon, the uniformed beat cop he had played in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, despite the fact that the Dixon character had been tragically murdered in that film. During the course of this somewhat gentle series, Warner&#x27;s character became, for many, the living embodiment of what every British &quot;bobby&quot; was supposed to be. As the series progressed, Dixon went through several promotions, eventually winding up as the Station Sergeant at his local division. By the final season, with Warner now over 80, Dixon retired and the focus shifted to the younger officers he&#x27;d trained up over the years.
* &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, (1957–67) – Produced with the cooperation of Scotland Yard, this long-running series featured Raymond Francis as high-ranking Met detective Tom Lockhart. During its run, the series went through several title changes. When it began in 1957, it was known as &quot;Murder Bag&quot;, referring to the bag of investigative tools that Superintendent Lockhart carried with him whenever he was called to a case. In 1959, with Lockhart promoted to Chief Superintendent, it became &quot;Crime Sheet&quot;. Later in 1959, the series was given its final and best-remembered title, &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, which lasted until the series ended in 1967.
* &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, (1962–78) – a police drama about two teams of uniformed constables (Brian Blessed, Joseph Brady, James Ellis, and Jeremy Kemp) assigned to &quot;Crime Patrol&quot; duties in a pair of powerful Ford Zephyrs, under the supervision of Detective Sergeant John Watt (Frank Windsor) and Detective Chief Inspector Charlie Barlow (Stratford Johns). A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; (1966–76), &quot;Barlow at Large&quot; (1971–75), and &quot;Second Verdict&quot; (1976).
* &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, (1965–66) – a crime series produced during 1964/65 and based on the novels by John Creasey (as J. J. Marric). The series was made at Elstree in twin production with The Saint TV series. It starred Liverpudlian John Gregson in the title role as Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard, with Alexander Davion as his assistant, Detective Chief Inspector David Keen, Reginald Jessup as Det. Superintendent LeMaitre (nicknamed Lemmy), Ian Rossiter as Detective Chief Superintendent Joe Bell and Basil Dignam as Commissioner Scott-Marle.
* &quot;New Scotland Yard&quot;, (1972–74) – a police drama series produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for the ITV network between 1972 and 1974. It features the activities of two officers from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in the Metropolitan Police force headquarters at New Scotland Yard, as they dealt with the assorted villains of the day.
* &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, (1975–78) – a drama series focusing on the Flying Squad of the Metropolitan Police and their twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job of catching some of the most dangerous and violent criminals in London. The television program featured Detective Inspector Jack Regan (John Thaw) and other tough-talking hard-drinking members of his elite unit, both on and off duty. With its high level of violence, location filming, bold frankness, and well written scripts, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; revolutionized the genre. The series was so phenomenally popular that two feature-length movies, &quot;Sweeney!&quot; (1976) and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978) were released to theatres during the show&#x27;s original broadcast run.
*&quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;, (1980–84) – a British police drama television series made by London Weekend Television for ITV. Commencing transmission on 11 April 1980, the series is notable for being the first British series to feature a female police detective as its leading character, ahead of the similarly themed BBC series Juliet Bravo by four months.
*&quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, (1980–85) – a British television series, which ran on BBC1. The theme of the series concerned a female police inspector who took over control of a police station in the fictional town of Hartley in Lancashire.
* &quot;Taggart&quot; (1983–2010)
* &quot;The Bill&quot;, (1984–2010) – a drama series focusing on both the uniformed and plain-clothes police officers working out of a fictional inner-London police station. The original conception of this series was as purely procedural, with an almost fly-on-the-wall approach that survived to an extent throughout.
* The &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; series, (1991–2006) – featuring Helen Mirren as Detective Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) Jane Tennison, which focused on the police investigations and on Tennison&#x27;s conflicts with her fellow officers as a prominent female detective in a heavily male-dominated work environment, as well as her personal problems concerning her family and after-work life.
* &quot;Cracker&quot; (1993–95) – hard-hitting drama series following dysfunctional criminal psychologist Dr Edward &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, played by Robbie Coltrane
* &quot;McCallum&quot; (1995–98)

Set in 1960s Yorkshire, in the fictional town of Ashfordly and the nearby village of Aidensfield in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the motorcycle-riding Aidensfield village bobby was originally played by Nick Berry.
* &quot;Rebus&quot; (2000–2007)

* &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; (2009–2014) is an adaptation of the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise for the British market. The programme is financed by Kudos Film and Television, Wolf Films (a company owned by Dick Wolf, the creator of the franchise) and NBC Universal and airs on ITV. The show is adapted from scripts and episodes of the original U.S. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.
* &quot;Suspects&quot; (2014–present) is an East London-based police procedural shot in a stripped-back documentary style using improvised dialogue, and follows DS Jack Weston (Damien Molony), DC Charlie Steele (Claire-Hope Ashitey) and their superior DI Martha Bellamy (Fay Ripley) as they investigate various crimes.

====United States====
* &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1951–59, 1967–70, 1989–91 and 2003–04) was a pioneering police procedural that began on radio in 1949 and then on television in 1951. &quot;Dragnet&quot; established the tone of many police dramas in subsequent decades, and the rigorously authentic depictions of such elements as organizational structure, professional jargon, legal issues, etc., set the standard for technical accuracy that became the most identifiable element of the police procedural in all media. The show was occasionally accused of presenting an overly idealized portrait of law enforcement in which the police (represented by Sgt. Joe Friday) were invariably presented as &quot;good guys&quot; and the criminals as &quot;bad guys&quot;, with little moral flexibility or complexity between the two. However, many episodes depicted sympathetic perpetrators while others depicted unsympathetic or corrupt cops. Further, though Jack Webb may have seemed to go to extremes to depict the Los Angeles Police Department in a favorable light, most depictions of cops at the time of &quot;Dragnet&quot;&#x27;s debut were both unsympathetic and unrealistic. Webb&#x27;s depiction was meant to offer balance. Also, the show benefited from the unprecedented technical advice, involvement, and support of the LAPD, a first in TV, which may also have been an incentive to depict the Department favorably. After the success of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, Webb produced other procedural shows like &quot;The DA&#x27;s Man&quot;, about an undercover investigator for the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s Office, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, about a pair of uniformed LAPD officers patrolling their beat in a radio car, and &quot;O&#x27;Hara, U.S. Treasury&quot;, with David Janssen as a trouble-shooting federal officer.
* &quot;Adam-12&quot; (1968–1975) is a television police procedural drama that follows Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed as they ride the streets of Los Angeles in their patrol unit, 1-Adam-12. The series was created by Robert A. Cinader and Jack Webb, the latter of whom also created Dragnet. It starred Martin Milner and Kent McCord and purported to realistically capture a typical day in the life of police officers. The show ran from September 21, 1968, through May 20, 1975, and helped to introduce police procedures and jargon to the general public in the United States.
* &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1959–63) fictionalized real-life Federal Agent Eliot Ness&#x27;s ongoing fight with prohibition-era gangs in Chicago and elsewhere. Originally a two-part presentation on the anthology series &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot;, it made such a splash that a series was launched the following fall. That two-part pilot, later released to theaters under the title &quot;The Scarface Mob&quot;, stuck comparatively close to the actual events, with Ness, as played by Robert Stack, recruiting a team of incorruptible investigators to help bring down Al Capone. Later episodes showed Ness and his squad, after Capone, going after just about every big name gangster of the era, and when the writers ran out of real-life figures to pit against Ness, they created new ones. Quinn Martin, who would become closely associated with police and crime shows like this, produced the series during its first season, leaving to found his own company, QM Productions, which would go one to produce police procedural shows like &quot;The New Breed&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Dan August&quot;, and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; over the next twenty years. The success of the series led to an Academy Award-winning motion picture in 1987, and a new TV series that was syndicated to local stations in 1993.
* &quot;Police Story&quot; (1973–78) was an anthology series set in Los Angeles created by LAPD Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh. Hard-hitting and unflinchingly realistic, its anthology format made it possible to look at LAPD police work from many different perspectives, what it was like to be a woman in a male-dominated profession, an honest cop suspected of corruption, a rookie cop, an undercover narc, a veteran facing retirement, or a cop who had to adjust to crippling injuries incurred in the line of duty. Despite its anthology format, there were a number of characters who appeared in more than one episode, including Robbery/Homicide partners Tony Calabrese (Tony Lo Bianco) and Bert Jameson (Don Meredith), vice cop turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka (James Farentino), and stakeout-surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda (Vic Morrow). Several series were spun off from the show, including &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Joe Forrester&quot;, and &quot;Man Undercover&quot;. During its last two seasons, the show appeared as an irregular series of two-hour TV movies rather than a weekly one-hour program. The show was revived for a season in 1988, using old scripts reshot with new casts when a writers&#x27; strike made new material inaccessible.
* &quot;Kojak&quot; (1973–78, 1989–90) created by Abby Mann, focused on a veteran New York City detective-lieutenant played by Telly Savalas. Its exteriors were filmed at New York&#x27;s Ninth Precinct, the same place where &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;&#x27;s exteriors would be filmed. In 1989, Savalas returned to the role briefly for five two-hour episodes, in which Kojak had been promoted to inspector and placed in charge of the Major Crimes Squad. It rotated with three other detective shows on ABC. A 2005 remake for the USA Network starred Ving Rhames. Kojak&#x27;s most memorable character trait was his signature lollipop.
* &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981–87) featured a number of intertwined storylines in each episode, and pioneered depiction of the conflicts between the work and private lives of officers and detectives on which the police procedural was centered. The show had a deliberate &quot;documentary&quot; style, depicting officers who were flawed and human, and dealt openly with the gray areas of morality between right and wrong. It was set in an unidentified east coast or Midwestern US city. The show was written by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll.
* &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–88) revolved around two female NYPD detectives who led very different lives. Christine Cagney, played by Sharon Gless, was a single-minded, witty, brash career woman. Mary Beth Lacey was a resourceful, sensitive working mom. Loretta Swit was the original choice for Cagney [she played the role in a TV movie]; however, she could not get out of her contract on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. During the first season, Meg Foster played the part of Cagney, while Tyne Daly played Lacey, the role she had originated in the pilot. CBS canceled the series claiming low ratings. It was brought back due both to a letter-writing campaign which drew millions of letters nationwide and because the ratings went &quot;up&quot; during summer reruns. A &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine read &quot;Welcome Back&quot;. Daly continued as Lacey, but Foster was replaced with Gless, who would become the actress most identified with the part. It had 36 nominations and 14 wins during its run. Four TV movies were broadcast after the series ended.
* &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984–90) and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (1987–91) showed the MTV style of Police procedurals.
* The &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise which started with the long-running series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1990–2010, 2022–present), focuses on the two &#x27;halves&#x27; of a criminal proceeding in the New York City criminal justice system: the investigation of the crime by the New York City Police Department homicide detectives and the subsequent prosecution of the criminals by the New York County District Attorney&#x27;s office. The success of the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; inspired ten other spin-off series in four different countries:
** Six in the U.S.: &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999–present), which focuses on sex crimes such as rape and child molestation, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2001–11), focusing on major crimes from the point of view of the criminal and capturing them from a psychological side, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot; (2005–06), which focuses more on the trial from both the prosecution and the defense teams&#x27; points of view, &quot;Conviction&quot; (2006), &quot;Law &amp; Order: LA&quot; (2010–11) and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot; (2021–present). &quot;Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;LA&quot; and &quot;Organized Crime&quot; series focused more on the police procedurals than &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and &quot;Conviction&quot;.
** Two in Russia: Adaptations of &quot;Special Victims Unit&quot; (2007) and &quot;Criminal Intent&quot; (2007), both set in Moscow.
** &quot;Paris enquêtes criminelles&quot; (2007), a French adaptation of &quot;Criminal Intent&quot; set in Paris.
** &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; (2009–2014), a British adaptation of the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; set in London.
:Aside from being its depiction of police investigation, this program also relates to the legal drama and &quot;forensic pathology&quot; subgenres, and has inspired such other programs as the &quot;&quot; series.
* &quot;&quot; (1993–99; TV movie in 2000), a police procedural focusing on the homicide unit of the Baltimore city police department. Critically praised (although frequently struggling in the ratings), the show was more of an ensemble piece, focusing on the activities of the unit as a whole (although significant characters such as Detective Frank Pembleton and Detective John Munch, who has also appeared on the various &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; shows, among others, became popular with viewers). The show (particularly in its first three seasons) used long-form arcs to depict ongoing criminal investigations, such as the investigation of a murdered child in the first season, which ran through 13 episodes but ended without an arrest or conviction, or even conclusive proof of who committed the crime. The show also heavily featured the complex internal politics of the police department, suggesting that rising through the ranks has more to do with personal connections, favors and opportunism than genuine ability.
* &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993–2005) explored the internal and external struggles of the assorted investigators of the fictional 15th Precinct of Manhattan. The show gained notoriety for profanity and nudity never previously broadcast on American network television. &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; was created by genre veteran Steven Bochco and David Milch. The cast of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; included actor Dennis Franz, who previously played Detective Buntz on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, as well as on a spin-off series, &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot;. Another cast member, David Caruso, would later play Lt. Horatio Caine on &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;.
* The &quot;CSI&quot; franchise, which started with &quot;&quot; (2000–2015) and eventually spawned two spin-offs focused on solving ordinary crimes using forensics, &quot;&quot; (2002–2012) and &quot;&quot; (2004–2013). Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, these three shows focus on three groups of forensic scientists in Las Vegas, Miami and New York City who investigate how and why a person has died and if it is a murder or not by investigating not only whodunit but also howdunit. A third spin-off, &quot;&quot; (2015–2016), focused on cybercrime and its impact on modern society.
* The CSI franchise inspired other forensic shows such as &quot;Body of Proof&quot; (2011–2013), &quot;Bones&quot; (2005–2017) and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; (2001–2007).
* The CSI franchise also inspired other crime dramas involving teams solving crimes but not relying on forensics; these include victim and witness memory for cold cases and missing people in &quot;Cold Case&quot; (2003–2010) and &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (2002–2009) respectively, psychological profiling in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2005–2020), using mathematics in &quot;Numbers&quot; (2005–2010) and using deception in &quot;The Mentalist&quot; (2008–2015).
* &quot;The Shield&quot; (2002–08) is about an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district (&quot;the Farm&quot;) of Los Angeles, using a converted church (&quot;the Barn&quot;) as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called &quot;The Strike Team&quot;, who will do anything to bring justice to the streets. Michael Chiklis (Chiklis previously played the title character in the TV series &quot;The Commish&quot;) has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader Detective Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Mackey. The show has an ensemble cast that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode. It was on the FX network and was known for its portrayal of police brutality and its realism. The show inspired other shows similar to &quot;The Shield&quot; such as &quot;Dark Blue&quot; and &quot;Southland&quot;. &quot;The Shield&quot; was created by writer/producer Shawn Ryan.
* The &quot;NCIS&quot; franchise, which was spun off from the CBS series &quot;JAG&quot; in 2003. The original series, &quot;NCIS&quot; (2003–present) follows the Major Case Response Team of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, as they investigate crimes related to the United States Navy and Marine Corps. &quot;NCIS&quot; has been among the top scripted series on U.S. television, and has received five spin-offs; &quot;&quot; (2009–2023) deals with an LA-based branch dealing in special undercover assignments, &quot;&quot; (2014–2021) focuses on a small group of agents who handle cases from the Mississippi River to the Texas Panhandle, &quot;&quot; (2021–2024) which focuses on agents working out of the Pearl Harbor Field Office, &quot;&quot; (2023–present) which focuses on a joint task force between NCIS and the Australian Federal Police that investigates incidents involving U.S. military personnel stationed in Australia, and &quot;&quot; (2024–present), a prequel series which follows the early career of &quot;NCIS&quot; lead character Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
* &quot;Castle&quot; (2009–2016), &quot;The Mentalist&quot; (2008–2015), &quot;Monk&quot; (2002–2009) and &quot;Psych&quot; (2006–2014) feature quirky investigators with their own distinct methods of solving crimes and are equally comedic shows as they are police procedurals.
* &quot;Chicago&quot; is a multi-genre franchise that focuses on the Chicago Police Department, the Fire Department, the Medical branch and Justice System respectively.
* &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; (2013–2021) is a single-camera police sitcom focusing on detectives in the 99th precinct in Brooklyn.
* The &quot;FBI&quot; franchise (2018–present)

==Comic strips and books==
The comic strip &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is often pointed to as an early procedural.

&quot;Tracy&quot; creator Chester Gould seemed to be trying to reflect the real world. Tracy himself, conceived by Gould as a &quot;modern-day Sherlock Holmes&quot;, was partly modeled on real-life law enforcer Eliot Ness. Tracy&#x27;s first, and most frequently recurring, antagonist, the Big Boy, was based on Ness&#x27;s real-life nemesis Al Capone. Other members of Tracy&#x27;s Rogues Gallery, like Boris Arson, Flattop Jones, and Maw Famon, were inspired, respectively, by John Dillinger, Charles &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd, and Kate &quot;Ma&quot; Barker.

Once &quot;Tracy&quot; was sold to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; syndicate, Gould enrolled in a criminology class at Northwestern University, met with members of the Chicago Police Department, and did research at the department&#x27;s crime lab, to make his depiction of law enforcement more authentic. Ultimately, he hired retired Chicago policeman Al Valanis, a pioneering forensic sketch artist, as both an artistic assistant and police technical advisor.

The success of &quot;Tracy&quot; led to many more police strips. While some, like Norman Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Dan Dunn&quot; were unabashedly slavish imitations of &quot;Tracy&quot;, others, like Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s and Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot;, took a more original approach. Still others, like Eddie Sullivan&#x27;s and Charlie Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;Radio Patrol&quot; and Will Gould&#x27;s &quot;Red Barry&quot;, steered a middle course. One of the best post-&quot;Tracy&quot; procedural comics was &quot;Kerry Drake&quot;, written and created by Allen Saunders and illustrated by Alfred Andriola. It diverged from the metropolitan settings used in &quot;Tracy&quot; to tell the story of the titular Chief Investigator for the District Attorney of a small-town jurisdiction. Later, following a personal tragedy, he leaves the DA&#x27;s Office and joins his small city&#x27;s police force in order to fight crime closer to the grass roots level. As both a DA&#x27;s man and a city cop, he fights a string of flamboyant, Gould-ian criminals like &quot;Stitches&quot;, &quot;Bottleneck&quot;, and &quot;Bulldozer&quot;.

Other syndicated police strips include Zane Grey&#x27;s &quot;King of the Royal Mounted&quot;, depicting police work in the contemporary Canadian Northwest, Lank Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Finn&quot;, which emphasized the home life of a hard-working cop, and &quot;Dragnet&quot;, which adapted stories from the pioneering radio-TV series into comics. Early comic books with police themes tended to be reprints of syndicated newspaper strips like &quot;Tracy&quot; and &quot;Drake&quot;. Others adapted police stories from other mediums, like the radio-inspired anthology comic &quot;Gang Busters&quot;, Dell&#x27;s &quot;87th Precinct&quot; issues, which adapted McBain&#x27;s novels, or &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, which adapted the fictionalized TV adventures of real-life policeman Eliot Ness.

More recently, there have been attempts to depict police work with the kind of hard-edged realism seen in the novels of writers like Wambaugh, such as Marvel&#x27;s four-issue mini-series &quot;Cops: The Job&quot;, in which a rookie police officer learns to cope with the physical, emotional, and mental stresses of law enforcement during her first patrol assignment. With superheroes having long dominated the comic book market, there have been some recent attempts to integrate elements of the police procedural into the universe of costumed crime-fighters. &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, for example, depicts a group of police detectives operating in Batman&#x27;s Gotham City, and suggested that the caped crime-fighter is disliked by many Gotham detectives for treading on their toes. Meanwhile, &quot;Metropolis SCU&quot; tells the story of the Special Crimes Unit, an elite squad of cops in the police force serving Superman&#x27;s Metropolis.

The use of police procedural elements in superhero comics can partly be attributed to the success of Kurt Busiek&#x27;s groundbreaking 1994 series &quot;Marvels&quot;, and his subsequent &quot;Astro City&quot; work, both of which examine the typical superhero universe from the viewpoint of the common man who witnesses the great dramas from afar, participating in them tangentially at best.

In the wake of Busiek&#x27;s success, many other writers mimicked his approach, with mixed results – the narrative possibilities of someone who does not get involved in drama are limited. In 2000, however, Image Comics published the first issue of Brian Michael Bendis&#x27;s comic &quot;Powers&quot;, which followed the lives of homicide detectives as they investigated superhero-related cases. Bendis&#x27;s success has led both Marvel Comics and DC Comics to begin their own superhero-themed police procedurals (&quot;District X&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Gotham Central&quot;), which focus on how the job of a police officer is affected by such tropes as secret identities, superhuman abilities, costumes, and the near-constant presence of vigilantes.

While the detectives in &quot;Powers&quot; were &quot;normal&quot; (unpowered) humans dealing with super-powered crime, Alan Moore and Gene Ha&#x27;s &quot;Top 10&quot; mini-series, published by America&#x27;s Best Comics in 2000–01, centered around the super-powered police force in a setting where powers are omnipresent. The comic detailed the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super-powers, colourful costumes and secret identities.

==Criticism==

===Masculinity and racism===
The police procedural is considered to be a male-dominant genre which very often portrays the masculine hero dedicated to the professional realm. The introduction of women as protagonists is commonly attributed to either adding sexual appeal, introducing gendered issues like investigating sex crimes, or delving into the personal relationships of the characters. It also often portrays rape myths, such as that rape is more often committed by strangers rather than a known acquaintance of the victim, that the majority of rape claims are false, and that rapes only happen to &quot;bad girls&quot;.
The portrayal of the criminal justice system also under-represents issues of race and institutional racism. A report by Color of Change Hollywood and the USC Annenberg Norman Lear Center identified that in these shows there was a severe lack of portrayal of racial bias in the criminal procedure, discussion about criminal justice reform, and victims who are women of color. There is also little representation of people of color in the creation of these shows.

===Biased narratives===
The police procedural genre is becoming increasingly popular and has accounted for about 22% of all scripted shows on US broadcast network in the last 10 years. This prevalence implies that viewers are often facing TV series that place police officers at the center of the story, showing exclusively their vision of the world. This approach has been denounced as enforcing the idea that the life and views of policemen are more important than the ones of the communities being policed.
In police procedurals, police officers are more often than not presented as the &quot;good guys&quot; or even close to superhuman, leading to a potentially biased narrative. Illegal practices are often presented as a necessary decision made in the general interest. A report by Color of Change Hollywood and the USC Annenberg Norman Lear Center revealed that police procedural shows were normalizing unjust practices such as illegal searches, surveillance, coercion, intimidation, violence, abuse, and racism.

===Misrepresentation of reality===
Criticisms have been raised against the genre for its unrealistic depiction of crime. Particularly, police procedurals have been accused of possessing an unrealistic preoccupation with incidents such as homicide and terrorism. In the United States, plot points involving murder investigations appear at more frequent rates than those involving theft, substance abuse, or domestic violence, which citizens are more likely to personally experience. Police procedurals have additionally portrayed attempted terrorism incidents at unrealistically high rates since the September 11 attacks and the start of the war on terror, prompting accusations of racial profiling and fear-mongering.
The manner in which crime has been portrayed in the media has subsequently been linked with discrepancies both in popular perception of crime rates, as well as sentencing. In a 2005 study conducted on the German public, it was found that despite a decline in total offences between 1992 and 2003, &quot;the German public believes or assumes, on balance, that crime has increased&quot;. It has been further posited that the distorted public perception arising from the prevalence of police procedurals has been a factor in influencing sentencing rates. Countries such as the US, UK and Germany—while experiencing declines in crime rates—reported increases in the volume and severity of incarceration.

===Recent efforts and developments===
Alongside protests against police brutality in the United States and abroad, and debates on the role of entertainment in the portrayal of law enforcement in society, the genre has been facing increased scrutiny. As a result, some television networks have been making an effort to address and correct the aforementioned criticism. In August 2020, it was announced that CBS writing staff would partner with 21CP Solutions, an advisory group on public safety and law enforcement, on the network&#x27;s legal dramas and police procedurals. CBS producers stated that the team, including civil rights experts, lawyers and police veterans, would fix issues with CBS police procedurals to make them more realistic and accurate. As a result, the main objectives and partnership&#x27;s attention is supposed to focus on an increase of inclusivity, diversity and authenticity in the production of police procedurals.

<text>The Los Angeles Alligator Farm, located next door to the Los Angeles Ostrich Farm in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States, was an alligator farm and a major city tourist attraction from 1907 until 1953.

Originally situated across from Lincoln Park, at 3627 Mission Road, it moved to Buena Park, California in 1953, where it was renamed the California Alligator Farm.

The Buena Park location was a “two-acre, junglelike park” across from Knott’s Berry Farm. Circa 1974, it housed “more than a hundred species representing all five orders of reptiles, with an emphasis on crocodilians.” Alligator and snake shows were held daily in summer and weekly in the off-season.

The attraction was shut down in 1984 after attendance dropped below 50,000 people annually, and the animals were relocated to a private estate in Florida.

<doc id="479158" wikidata="Q3544042" url="?curid=479158" title="USS Sargo (SSN-583)">
<text>USS &quot;Sargo&quot; (SSN-583), a nuclear-powered submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sargo, a food and game fish of the porgy family, inhabiting coastal waters of the southern United States.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Sargo&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, on 29 September 1955 and her keel was laid down on 21 February 1956. She was launched on 10 October 1957, sponsored by the wife of Rear Admiral Frank T. Watkins, and commissioned on 1 October 1958 with Commander Daniel P. Brooks in command.

==Operational history==

Prior to completion, &quot;Sargo&quot; was designated for an Arctic cruise. She received alterations to strengthen her sail before she left the building yard. Further modifications followed her 19,000-mile (35,200 km) Pacific shakedown cruise. After her arrival at her home port, Pearl Harbor, on 1 October 1959, scientific instruments were installed to assist her in navigating under the shifting polar ice with its potentially hazardous submerged pressure ridges; in locating open leads and thin ice through which to surface, and in gathering oceanographic and hydrographic data. November and December 1959 brought intensive training programs and the embarkation of scientific specialists; and, on 18 January 1960, &quot;Sargo&quot;, under the command of Lieutenant Commander J.H. Nicholson, cleared Pearl Harbor and headed north to make a submerged exploration of the Arctic Ocean.

By 25 January, &quot;Sargo&quot; had reached the vicinity of St. Matthews Island where she found ice, block and brash and where, after rendezvousing with the United States Navy icebreaker USS &quot;Staten Island&quot; (AGB-5) she made her first stationary dive while surrounded by ice. On 29 January, she passed the Diomede Islands and crossed the Arctic Circle; and, on 9 February, she arrived under the North Pole.

Making her first pass under the pole at 0934, the submarine began a clover-leaf search for thin ice and at 1049 she surfaced, according to her log, 25 feet (8 m) from the pole. Later the same day, the Hawaiian flag was raised at the pole, and, on the morning of 10 February, &quot;Sargo&quot; submerged and set a course for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and a rendezvous with ice island T-3.

Collecting hydrographic data as she progressed, she reached T-3 on 17 February. Thence, after conducting tests in cooperation with scientists on the ice island, she got underway for the Bering Strait, the Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii. On 3 March 1960, &quot;Sargo&quot;, having covered over 11,000 miles (20,000 km), 6,003 miles (11,118 km) under ice, returned to Pearl Harbor with new data on Arctic ice, Arctic waters, and the physiography of the Arctic Basin. The latter included information on Alpha Ridge and on the presence of deep water areas at the western end of the northwest passage. For this cruise the &quot;Sargo&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation, the second highest award possible for a ship of the United States Navy.

Repairs took &quot;Sargo&quot; into April. At the end of that month, she resumed operations in the Hawaiian area with a demonstration cruise for the King of Nepal.

On 14 June, the submarine was docked in Pearl Harbor, preparing to take Bhumibol Adulyadej and his wife Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, the King and Queen of Thailand on a cruise the next day. &quot;Sargo&quot; was charging her oxygen tanks when the oxygen line, which entered the submarine through the stern torpedo room hatch, developed a leak and a fire ignited. Two Mark 37 torpedo warheads detonated &quot;low-order&quot;, and the fire spread dramatically, killing the crewman tending the oxygen line, machinist&#x27;s mate third class James E. Smallwood. The fire, fed by the pressurized oxygen, shot flames over 100 feet (30 m) in the air through the hatch. When the combined forces of the shipyard and the boat&#x27;s crew were unable to control the fire, &quot;Sargo&quot;&#x27;s officers took the submarine a short distance from the dock and dove with the stern room hatch open. The fire was extinguished, and &quot;Sargo&quot; bottomed in the channel. A floating crane raised the &quot;Sargo&quot;, and repairs took three months in drydock.

James E. Smallwood MM3(SS), lost his life in the fire while taking action to save the ship. He was awarded, posthumously, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his heroic actions and other crew members were also awarded medals and letters of commendation for outstanding courage over and above the call of duty. On 15 April 1987, Submarine Base Pearl Harbor opened a new 17-story Bachelor Enlisted Quarters, which was dedicated on 26 February 1988 in the memory of Smallwood and the sacrifice of his life while performing in the service of his country.

From October through December 1960, &quot;Sargo&quot; again conducted type training exercises.

In 1961 &quot;Sargo&quot; assumed a more regular schedule. On 19 January, she sailed for the Philippines on her first deployment with the Seventh Fleet. In the western Pacific into May, she participated in exercises to enhance the antisubmarine warfare readiness of hunter-killer groups and visited Sydney, for the 19th Annual Coral Sea Celebration. On 25 May, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Upkeep and local operations took her into late July, when she began a two-month training cruise. In November, she moved east, to California, to participate in a demonstration for the Chief of Naval Operations and foreign attaches. She then returned to Pearl Harbor for holiday leave and upkeep. During the late winter and early spring of 1962, &quot;Sargo&quot; made another extended cruise in the western Pacific, again earning a Navy Unit Commendation for her effort.

Local operations and upkeep followed her return to Pearl Harbor; and, in July, she entered the naval shipyard there for an overhaul which lasted through the winter of 1962 and 1963. During the work, she became the first nuclear ship to be refueled at that shipyard. In mid-summer 1963, she commenced an extended cruise to the western Pacific, and, in October she returned to Hawaii for six months of local operations.

From April to October 1964, &quot;Sargo&quot; once again deployed to the western Pacific; and, during August, she was called on to support operations resulting from the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. After her return to Hawaii, local operations and upkeep took her into the next year. In April 1965, she commenced another cruise in the western Pacific, and, in June, she resumed operations in the eastern Pacific. Five months later, she again moved westward across the Pacific; and, in February 1966, she returned to Hawaii to enter the naval shipyard at Pearl Harbor where she remained for the next two years, undergoing overhaul and refueling. Between 1963 and 1965 &quot;Sargo&quot; earned three more Navy Unit Commendations.

On 5 April 1968, &quot;Sargo&quot; left the shipyard. She had been overhauled and her third reactor core had been installed. Refresher training followed and, in June she resumed her previous schedule with an extended cruise in the western Pacific. Since that time, into 1974, she has maintained a schedule of eastern and western Pacific cruises and training operations, including joint British, Australian, and American exercises in the South China Sea in January 1969.

<text>The Central Valley Project (CVP) is a federal power and water management project in the U.S. state of California under the supervision of the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). It was devised in 1933 in order to provide irrigation and municipal water to much of California&#x27;s Central Valley—by regulating and storing water in reservoirs in the northern half of the state (once considered water-rich but suffering water-scarce conditions more than half the year in most years), and transporting it to the water-poor San Joaquin Valley and its surroundings by means of a series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants, some shared with the California State Water Project (SWP). Many CVP water users are represented by the Central Valley Project Water Association.

In addition to water storage and regulation, the system has a hydroelectric capacity of over 2,000 megawatts, and provides recreation and flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs. It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood each spring, and transformed the semi-arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland. Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during high tide. There are eight divisions of the project and ten corresponding units, many of which operate in conjunction, while others are independent of the rest of the network. California agriculture and related industries now directly account for 7% of the gross state product for which the CVP supplied water for about half.

Many CVP operations have had considerable environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers in the northern state, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.

In recent years, a combination of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for the west side of the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Northern and Central California rivers. In 2017 the Klamath and Trinity rivers witnessed the worst fall run Chinook salmon return in recorded history, leading to a disaster declaration in California and Oregon due to the loss of the commercial fisheries. The recreational fall Chinook salmon fishery in both the ocean and the Trinity and Klamath rivers was also closed in 2017. Only 1,123 adult winter Chinook salmon returned to the Sacramento Valley in 2017, according to a report sent to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). This is the second lowest number of returning adult winter run salmon since modern counting techniques were implemented in 2003. By comparison, over 117,000 winter Chinooks returned to spawn in 1969.

== Overview ==

=== Operations ===
The CVP stores about of water in 20 reservoirs in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains and the California Coast Ranges, and passes about of water annually through its canals. Of the water transported, about goes to irrigate of farmland, supplies municipal uses, and is released into rivers and wetlands in order to comply with state and federal ecological standards.

Two large reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake, are formed by a pair of dams in the mountains north of the Sacramento Valley. Water from Shasta Lake flows into the Sacramento River which flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and water from Trinity Lake flows into the Trinity River which leads to the Pacific Ocean. Both lakes release water at controlled rates. There, before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, some of the water is intercepted by a diversion channel and transported to the Delta-Mendota Canal, which conveys water southwards through the San Joaquin Valley, supplying water to San Luis Reservoir (a SWP-shared facility) and the San Joaquin River at Mendota Pool in the process, eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley. Friant Dam crosses the San Joaquin River upstream of Mendota Pool, diverting its water southwards into canals that travel into the Tulare Lake area of the San Joaquin Valley, as far south as the Kern River. Finally, New Melones Lake, a separate facility, stores water flow of a San Joaquin River tributary for use during dry periods. Other smaller, independent facilities exist to provide water to local irrigation districts.

=== Background ===
The Central Valley Project was the world&#x27;s largest water and power project when undertaken during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal public works agenda. The Project was the culmination of eighty years of political fighting over the state&#x27;s most important natural resource - Water. The Central Valley of California lies to the west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains with its annual run-off draining into the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. It is a large receding geological floodplain moderated by its Mediterranean climate of dry summers and wet winters that includes regular major drought cycles. At the time of its construction, the project was at the center of a political and cultural battle over the state&#x27;s future. It intersected with the state&#x27;s ongoing war over land use, access to water rights, impacts on indigenous communities, large vs. small farmers, the state&#x27;s irrigation districts and public vs. private power. Its proponents ignored environmental concerns over its impacts, other than the outcome not damage the major stakeholders at that time.

The Central Valley of California has gone through two distinct culturally driven land use eras. The first was the indigenous tribal period that lasted for thousands of years. Then came the arrival of Europeans, first by the Spanish colonial model of Catholic missions and ranchos (1772–1846) was then followed by the current United States era. Due to its Mediterranean climate, the first cultural period was hunter-gatherer based. The Spanish missions&#x27; ranching and tanning business was based on the forced labor of Las Californias tribes. Spain&#x27;s model of land use with the grazing of livestock for meat, wool and leather started along Alta California&#x27;s coast eventually spreading inland. The U.S. era evolved from primarily ranching to large-scale plantations or more commonly known today as corporate farming that turned the Central Valley into the breadbasket of the U.S.

Following the 1848 California Gold Rush, large numbers of U.S. citizens came into the region and made attempts to practice rainfed agriculture, but most of the Central Valley land was taken up by large cattle ranchers like Henry Miller who eventually controlled 22,000 square miles of land. The large-scale levee construction by Chinese workers along the Delta was where limited irrigation for orchards first started.

Following the arrival of the Transcontinental railroad, immigration from Asia and the rest of the U.S. led to growing numbers of settlers in the region. Despite the rich soils and favorable weather of the Central Valley, immigrants to the valley who were unfamiliar with its seasonal patterns of rainfall and flooding began to take up irrigation practices. Farmers soon found themselves troubled by frequent floods in the Sacramento Valley and a general lack of water in the San Joaquin Valley. The Sacramento River, which drains the northern part, receives between 60 and 75% of the precipitation in the Valley, despite the Sacramento Valley covering less area than the much larger San Joaquin Valley, drained by the San Joaquin River, which receives only about 25% of the rainfall. Furthermore, cities drawing water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta faced problems in dry summer and autumn months when the inflowing water was low. In order to continue to sustain the valley&#x27;s economy, there needed to be systems to regulate flows in the rivers and equally distribute water among the north and south parts of the valley.

===History===

In 1873, Barton S. Alexander completed a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that was the first attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state&#x27;s treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.

== Facilities in the Sacramento Valley ==

=== Sacramento River ===

Shasta Division consists of a pair of large dams on the Sacramento River north of the city of Redding. The Shasta Dam is the primary water storage and power generating facility of the CVP. It impounds the Sacramento River to form Shasta Lake, which can store over of water, and can generate 680 MW of power. Shasta Dam functions to regulate the flow of the Sacramento River so that downstream diversion dams and canals can capture the flow of the river more efficiently, and to prevent flooding in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta where many water pump facilities for San Joaquin Valley aqueducts are located. The Keswick Dam functions as an afterbay (regulating reservoir) for the Shasta Dam, also generating power.

The Sacramento Canals Division of the CVP takes water from the Sacramento River much farther downstream of the Shasta and Keswick Dams. Diversion dams, pumping plants, and aqueducts provide municipal water supply as well as irrigation of about . The Red Bluff Diversion Dam diverts part of the Sacramento River into the Tehama-Colusa Canal, the Corning Canal and a small reservoir formed by Funks Dam. Six pump plants take water from the canal and feed it to the Colusa County water distribution grid.

=== Trinity River ===

Water diversions from northern rivers in the state remain controversial due to environmental damage. Trinity River Division is the second largest CVP department for the northern Sacramento Valley. The primary purpose of the division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.

=== American River ===

The American River Division is located in north-central California, on the east side of the Great Central Valley. Its structures use the water of the American River, which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River. The division is further divided into three units: the Folsom, Sly Park and Auburn-Folsom South. The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood control measure. Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams, and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration.

The Folsom Unit consists of Folsom Dam, its primary water storage component, and Nimbus Dam, which serves as its downstream forebay. The Folsom Dam is located on the American River, and stores of water in its reservoir, Folsom Lake. Folsom Lake covers and is located inside the Folsom Lake State Recreational Area. Eight additional earth fill saddle dams are required to keep the reservoir from overflowing. The dam also generates 200 MW from three generators. About downstream of Folsom Dam is the Nimbus Dam, forming Lake Natoma. The dam generates 7.7 MW from two Kaplan turbines on the north side of the river. The &quot;Nimbus Fish Hatchery&quot; is located downstream of Nimbus Dam, to compensate for the two dams&#x27; destruction of American River spawning grounds.
The Sly Park Unit includes Sly Park Dam, Jenkinson Lake, the Camp Creek Diversion Dam, and two diversion tunnels. The Sly Park Dam and its similarly-sized auxiliary dam form Jenkinson Lake, which covers . Jenkinson Lake feeds the Camino Conduit, a aqueduct. The Camp Creek Diversion Dam diverts some water from Camp Creek into Jenkinson Lake.

The third unit is the Auburn-Folsom South Unit, consisting of several dams on American River tributaries. These include Sugar Pine Dam and Pipeline (supplying water to Foresthill), and the uncompleted Folsom South Canal. The primary component of the unit, concrete thin-arch Auburn Dam, was to be located on the North Fork of the American, but was never built because of the significant risk of earthquakes in the area, and general public opposition to the project. However, the high Foresthill Bridge, built as part of the preliminary work for Auburn Dam, still stands. County Line Dam, about south of Folsom Dam, was also never built.

== Facilities in the San Joaquin Valley ==

=== Delta and canal system ===
One of the most important parts of the CVP&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley water system is the series of aqueducts and pumping plants that take water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and send it southwards to supply farms and cities. The Delta Cross Channel intercepts Sacramento River water as it travels westwards towards Suisun Bay and diverts it south through a series of man-made channels, the Mokelumne River, and other natural sloughs, marshes and distributaries. From there, the water travels to the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant, which raises water into the Delta-Mendota Canal, which in turn travels southwards to Mendota Pool on the San Joaquin River, supplying water to other CVP reservoirs about midway. A facility exists at the entrance of the pump plant in order to catch fish that would otherwise end up in the Delta-Mendota Canal. A second canal, the Contra Costa Canal, captures freshwater near the central part of the delta, taking it southwards, distributing water to the Clayton and Ygnacio Canals in the process, and supplying water to Contra Loma Dam, eventually terminating at Martinez Reservoir.

=== San Joaquin River ===
The CVP also has several dams on the San Joaquin River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to southern Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, is the largest component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators as well as providing a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River. The Central Valley also consisted of 500 miles of canals, providing the city dwellers and power sales from the generation of electricity pay of the project costs.

=== Stanislaus River ===
On the Stanislaus River, a major tributary of the San Joaquin, lies the relatively independent East Side Division and New Melones Unit of the CVP. The sole component of the division/unit is New Melones Dam, forming New Melones Lake, which, when filled to capacity, holds nearly of water, about equal to the storage capacity of Trinity Lake. The dam functions to store water during dry periods and release it downstream into the northern San Joaquin Valley according to water demand. The dam generates 279 MW of power with a peaking capacity of 300 MW.

=== Offstream storage and aqueducts ===

The CVP has a significant amount of facilities for storing and transporting water on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, in the foothills of the California Coast Ranges. The West San Joaquin Division and San Luis Unit consist of several major facilities that are shared with the federal California State Water Project (SWP). San Luis Dam (or B.F. Sisk Dam) is the largest storage facility, holding of water.
Although called an offstream storage reservoir by USBR, the reservoir floods part of the San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O&#x27;Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.

Water released from San Luis and O&#x27;Neill reservoirs feeds into the San Luis Canal, the federally built section of the California Aqueduct, which carries both CVP and SWP water. The San Luis Canal terminates at Kettleman City, where it connects with the state-built section of the California Aqueduct. With a capacity of , it is one of the largest irrigation canals in the United States. The Coalinga Canal (operated for USBR by the Westlands Water District) branches off the San Luis Canal towards the Coalinga area. A pair of separate dams, Los Baños Detention Dam and Little Panoche Detention Dam, provide flood control in the Los Baños area. The San Luis Drain was a separate project by USBR in an attempt to keep contaminated irrigation drainage water out of the San Joaquin River, emptying into Kesterson Reservoir where the water would evaporate or seep into the ground. Because of environmental concerns, the system was never completed.

The CVP also operates a San Felipe Division to supply water to of land in the Santa Clara Valley west of the Coast Ranges. San Justo Dam stores water diverted from San Luis Reservoir through the Pacheco Tunnel and Hollister Conduit, which travel through the Diablo Range. A separate canal, the Santa Clara Tunnel and Conduit, carries water to the Santa Clara Valley.

== Environmental impacts ==

Once, profuse runs of anadromous fish—salmon, steelhead, and others—migrated up the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to spawn in great numbers. The construction of CVP dams on the two rivers and many of their major tributaries—namely Friant Dam and Shasta Dam—mostly ended the once-bountiful Central Valley salmon run. From north to south, the Sacramento upriver of Shasta Dam, the American upriver of Folsom Dam, the Stanislaus upriver of New Melones Dam, and the San Joaquin upriver of Mendota—have become inaccessible to migrating salmon. In three of these cases, it is because the dams are too high and their reservoirs too large for fish to bypass via fish ladders. The San Joaquin River, however, had a different fate. Almost of the river is dry because of diversions from Friant Dam and Millerton Lake. Even downstream of Mendota, where the Delta-Mendota Canal gives the river a new surge of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, irrigation runoff water, contaminated with pesticides and fertilizer, has caused the river to become heavily polluted. To make matters worse, efforts by the California Department of Fish and Game to route the San Joaquin salmon run into the Merced River in the 1950s failed, because the salmon did not recognize the Merced as their &quot;home stream&quot;.

Not only on the San Joaquin River have CVP facilities wreaked environmental havoc. On the Sacramento River, Red Bluff Diversion Dam in Tehama County, while not as large or as impacting as Friant Dam, was once a barrier to the migration of anadromous fish. The original fish passage facilities of the dam continually experienced problems from the beginning of operation in 1966, and introduced species that prey on young smolt often gather at the base of the dam, which reduced the population of outmigrating juvenile salmon into the Pacific. The Red Bluff Diversion Dam has since been replaced with a fish screen and pumping plant, thus allowing unimpaired passage through Red Bluff. Further upstream, Keswick and Shasta Dams form total barriers to fish migration. Even out of the Central Valley watershed, the CVP&#x27;s diversion of water from the Trinity River from Lewiston Dam into Whiskeytown Lake has significantly hurt the Klamath River tributary&#x27;s salmon run. Over three-quarters of the river&#x27;s flow is diverted through the Clear Creek Tunnel and away from the Trinity River, causing the river below the dam to become warm, silty, shallow and slow-flowing, attributes that hurt young salmon. Furthermore, the Trinity Dam forms a blockade that prevents salmon from reaching about of upriver spawning grounds. In the early years of the 21st century, the Bureau of Reclamation finally began to steadily increase the water flow downstream from Lewiston Dam. While providing less water for the CVP altogether, the new flow regime allows operations to meet the line drawn by Reclamation itself in 1952 stating that at least 48% of the river&#x27;s natural flow must be left untouched in order for Trinity River salmon to survive. The lack of flow in the Trinity up to then was also a violation of the authorization that Congress made over the operation of the dam. The &quot;...legislation required that enough be left in the Trinity for in-basin needs, including preservation of the salmon fishery.&quot;

In the early years of the 21st century, the Bureau of Reclamation studied the feasibility of raising Shasta Dam. One of the proposed heights was greater than its current size, thus increasing the storage capacity of Shasta Lake by . The agency also proposed a smaller raise of that would add . Previously, a raise of the dam, increasing storage to , was considered, but deemed uneconomical. When Shasta Dam was first built, it was actually planned to be two hundred feet higher than it is now, but Reclamation stopped construction at its present height because of a shortage of materials and workers during World War II. The raising of the dam would further regulate and store more Sacramento River water for dry periods, thus benefiting the entire operations of the CVP, and also generating additional power. However, the proposed height increase was fought over for many reasons. Raising the dam would cost several hundred million dollars and raise the price of irrigation water from Shasta Lake. It would drown most of the remaining land belonging to the Winnemem Wintu tribe—90 percent of whose land already lies beneath the surface of the lake—and flood several miles of the McCloud River, protected under National Wild and Scenic River status. Buildings, bridges, roads and other structures would have to be relocated. The added capacity of the reservoir would change flow fluctuations in the lower Sacramento River, and native fish populations, especially salmon, would suffer with the subsequent changes to the ecology of the river.
New Melones Dam has come under even greater controversy than Shasta Dam, mainly because of the project&#x27;s conflicts with federal and state limits and its impact on the watershed of the Stanislaus River. The original Melones Dam, submerged underneath New Melones Lake (hence the name &quot;New Melones Dam&quot;) is the source of one of these problems. The disused Melones Dam blocks cold water at the bottom of the lake from reaching the river, especially in dry years when the surface of the lake is closer to the crest of the old dam. This results in the river below the dam attaining a much higher temperature than usual, hurting native fish and wildlife. To solve this problem, Reclamation shuts off operations of the dam&#x27;s hydroelectric power plant when water levels are drastically low, but this results in power shortages. Originally, after the dam was constructed, the State of California put filling the reservoir on hold because of enormous public opposition to what was being inundated: the limestone canyon behind the dam, the deepest of its kind in the United States, contained hundreds of archaeological and historic sites and one of California&#x27;s best and most popular whitewater rafting runs. Thus the reservoir extended only to Parrot&#x27;s Ferry Bridge, below its maximum upriver limit, until the El Niño event of 1982–1983, which filled it to capacity within weeks and even forced Reclamation to open the emergency spillways, prompting the state and federal governments to repeal the limits they had imposed on the reservoir. Furthermore, the project allows a far smaller sustainable water yield than originally expected, and Reclamation calls the dam &quot;a case study of all that can go wrong with a project&quot;.

In response to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP&#x27;s canals, and other items. Despite the preservation of river programs, the state legislature continued to have the power to construct dams.

<doc id="479160" wikidata="Q1334295" url="?curid=479160" title="Howard Ashman">
<text>Howard Elliott Ashman (May 17, 1950 – March 14, 1991) was an American playwright, lyricist and stage director. He is most widely known for his work on feature films for Walt Disney Animation Studios, for which Ashman wrote the lyrics and Alan Menken composed the music. Ashman has been credited as being a main driving force behind the Disney Renaissance. His work included songs for &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Tim Rice took over to write the rest of the songs for the latter film after Ashman&#x27;s death in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Ashman was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Shirley Thelma (née Glass) and Raymond Albert Ashman, an ice cream cone manufacturer. His family was Jewish. He started his theater experiences with the Children&#x27;s Theater Association (CTA), playing roles such as Peter Pan. Ashman first studied at Boston University and Goddard College (with a stop at Tufts University&#x27;s Summer Theater) and then went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in Fine Arts at Indiana University in 1974.

==Career==
After graduating from Indiana University in 1974, Ashman moved to New York and worked as an editor at Grosset &amp; Dunlap. His first two plays, &quot;Cause Maggie&#x27;s Afraid of the Dark&quot; and &quot;Dreamstuff&quot;, were met with mixed reviews. Ashman&#x27;s play &quot;The Confirmation&quot; was produced in 1977 at Princeton&#x27;s McCarter Theater and starred Herschel Bernardi. In 1977, he became the artistic director of the WPA Theater in New York. Ashman met future collaborator Alan Menken at the BMI Workshop, where he was classmates with Maury Yeston and Ed Kleban, among others. He first worked with Menken on the 1979 musical &quot;Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, adapted from Vonnegut&#x27;s novel of the same name. They also collaborated on &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; with Ashman as director, lyricist, and librettist, winning the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics and receiving a Grammy Award nomination. Ashman also directed the workshop of &quot;Nine&quot; by Yeston at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center, and after asking why Guido&#x27;s wife stays with him after she knows he has not been faithful, inspired Yeston to write &quot;My Husband Makes Movies&quot;.

Ashman was director, lyricist, and book writer for the 1986 Broadway musical &quot;Smile&quot; (music by Marvin Hamlisch). This musical was generally not well received and closed with only 48 performances. However, Ashman received a nomination at the Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical. Also in 1986, Ashman wrote the screenplay for the Frank Oz–directed film adaptation of his musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, as well as contributing the lyrics for two new songs, &quot;Some Fun Now&quot; and &quot;Mean Green Mother from Outer Space&quot;, the latter of which received an Academy Award nomination.

In 1986, Ashman was brought in to write lyrics for a song in Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. He then also worked with Tina Turner on a script which never came to fruition. While there, Ashman was offered several works which had been on the back burner and was told about another project that Disney had been working on for a couple years. The film was &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, Disney&#x27;s first fairy tale in 30 years. Ashman, along with Menken, wrote all of the songs for the film. Ashman became a driving force during the early years of the &quot;Disney Renaissance&quot;. He would hold story meetings and said the animation and musical styles were made for each other, which is why Disney needed to continue making musical movies. Ashman also made strong choices in casting actors with strong musical theater and acting backgrounds. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was released in November 1989 and was an enormous success. Ashman and Menken received two nominations at the Golden Globe Awards and three nominations at the Academy Awards, including two Best Original Song nominations for &quot;Kiss the Girl&quot; and &quot;Under The Sea&quot; with Ashman and Menken winning for the latter.

In 1988, while working on &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of &quot;Aladdin&quot; to Disney. After he wrote a group of songs with partner Alan Menken and a film treatment, a screenplay was written by Linda Woolverton, who had worked on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Directors John Musker and Ron Clements then joined the production, and the story underwent many changes, with some elements of the original treatment being dropped. Out of the 16 songs written for &quot;Aladdin&quot;, three of Ashman&#x27;s songs ended up in the finished film, which was released after his death.

During the early production of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Ashman and Menken were approached to help reinvigorate and save the production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, which was going nowhere as a non-musical. Ashman, wishing to focus on &quot;Aladdin&quot; and his health, reluctantly agreed. It was at this time that his health began to decline due to his illness. Regardless, he completed lyrical work on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; before his death in March 1991. The film was released mere months after his death and is dedicated to him. In May 2020, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; co-director Kirk Wise said, &quot;If you had to point to one person responsible for the &#x27;Disney Renaissance&#x27;, I would say it was Howard.&quot;

Along with Menken, Ashman was the co-recipient of two Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Academy Awards.

==Personal life==
Ashman met Stuart White, one of his first partners, at a summer university program in 1969. Originally close friends, the two formed a bond which led to a relationship. They both completed master&#x27;s degrees at Indiana University and then moved to New York. Ashman and White re-opened the Workshop of Players Art Foundation (WPA) together as artistic directors. The two fell out in 1980, but reunited briefly in 1983.

Ashman then met Bill Lauch in 1984, who worked as an architect. Lauch accepted Ashman&#x27;s posthumous Oscar for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 1992, after Ashman&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Ashman was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in January 1988 during production of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, as he continued to write songs. Peter Kunze noted that Ashman was supported by Jeffrey Katzenberg; Disney created a production unit near his home in Beacon, New York, allowing him to continue working on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, while undergoing treatment at the Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Centers in New York City. Ashman died at Saint Vincent&#x27;s on March 14, 1991, at the age of 40, prior to the film&#x27;s completion. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was dedicated to his memory, featuring the message after the end credits: &quot;To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman 1950-1991&quot;. He was buried in the Ohev Shalom Cemetery in Reisterstown, Maryland.

==Awards and nominations==
Over the course of his career, Ashman won two Academy Awards (one posthumous) out of seven nominations. Of these nominations, four are posthumous nominations, the most in Academy Awards history. He also won a posthumous Laurence Olivier Award and five Grammy Awards (three of them posthumous), among other accolades.

=== Accolades ===
=== Special recognitions ===
* 1990 – Special Award for outstanding contribution to the success of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences&#x27; anti-drug special for children, for the song &quot;Wonderful Ways to Say No&quot; from the TV special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;
* 2001 – Disney Legend Award (POSTHUMOUS)

=== Tributes ===
On the 2002 Special Edition DVD of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, the Disney animators teamed up again and added a new song called &quot;Human Again&quot;, which Ashman and Menken had written for the film but had been cut from the finished product. On Disc 2, there is a short documentary entitled &quot;Howard Ashman: In Memoriam&quot; that features many people who worked on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; who talk about Ashman&#x27;s involvement on the film and how his death was truly a loss for them.

Jeffrey Katzenberg claims there are two angels watching down on them that put their magic touch on every film they made. Those two angels are Ashman and Walt Disney himself.

An album of Ashman singing his own work entitled &quot;Howard Sings Ashman&quot; was released on November 11, 2008, by PS Classics as part of the Library of Congress &quot;Songwriter Series&quot;.

The 2009 documentary, &quot;Waking Sleeping Beauty&quot;, which centers around Disney&#x27;s animation renaissance, is dedicated to him, as well as Frank Wells, Joe Ranft, and Roy E. Disney.

In March 2017, Don Hahn confirmed he was working on a documentary biographical film about Howard Ashman. The documentary film titled &quot;Howard&quot; premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22, 2018, before having a limited theatrical run on December 18, 2018. It was released on Disney+ on August 7, 2020, and was initially slated for removal on May 26, 2023. However, Disney reversed course in response to fan outcry.

Like with the original &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, the 2023 live-action adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was also dedicated to his memory.

Menken has collaborated with lyricists such as Howard Ashman, Tim Rice, Stephen Schwartz, David Zippel, Glenn Slater, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

== Early life and education ==
Alan Irwin Menken was born on July 22, 1949, at French Hospital in Manhattan, to Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist, and his mother was an actress, dancer and playwright. His family was Jewish. Menken developed an interest in music at an early age, taking piano and violin lessons. He began to compose at an early age. At age nine, at the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest, his original composition &quot;Bouree&quot; was rated Superior and Excellent by the judges.

Menken noted that &quot;Before college, I was writing songs to further my dream of being the next Bob Dylan. A lot of guitar songs – I was composing on piano before that.&quot;

He attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: &quot;I&#x27;d make up my own Bach fugues and Beethoven sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn&#x27;t want to practice; so I&#x27;d go off on tangents&quot;. He then enrolled at New York University. Menken graduated in 1972 from University College of Arts and Science at the Heights campus, which is now the College of Arts and Science. After college, he attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.

Menken recalled: &quot;First, I was pre-med. I thought I&#x27;d be a dentist like my dad. Finally, I got a degree in music, but I didn&#x27;t care about musicology. It wasn&#x27;t until I joined BMI Workshop ... under Lehman Engel, and walked into a room with other composers that I knew this was it.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1974–1987: Early career and breakthrough ===

After graduating, Menken&#x27;s plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Apartment House&quot; (lyric by Muriel Robinson), &quot;Conversations with Pierre&quot;,&quot; Harry the Rat&quot; and &quot;Messiah on Mott Street&quot; (lyrics by David Spencer). According to Menken, during this period, he &quot;worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and a vocal coach&quot;. He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.

In 1976, John Wilson reported for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that members of Engel&#x27;s BMI Workshop began performing as part of the &quot;Broadway at the Ballroom&quot; series: &quot;The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals.&quot; Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: &quot;In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing.&quot;

Menken contributed material to revues like &quot;New York&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;, &quot;Big Apple Country&quot;, &quot;The Present Tense&quot; (1977), &quot;Real Life Funnies&quot; (Off-Broadway, 1981), &quot;Diamonds&quot; (Off-Broadway, 1984), and &quot;Personals&quot; (Off-Off-Broadway, 1985). His revue &quot;Patch, Patch, Patch&quot; ran at the West Bank Cafe in New York City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Mel Gussow wrote: &quot;The title song ... refers to a life&#x27;s passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge.&quot; Menken wrote several shows that were not produced, including &quot;Atina, Evil Queen of the Galaxy&quot; (1980), with lyrics by Steve Brown. He also wrote &quot;The Thorn&quot; with lyrics by Brown, which was commissioned by Divine in 1980. This was a parody of the film &quot;The Rose&quot;, but they could not raise the money to have it produced. He collaborated with Howard Ashman in an uncompleted musical called &quot;Babe&quot; (), with Tom Eyen in &quot;Kicks: The Showgirl Musical&quot; (1984), and with David Rogers in &quot;The Dream in Royal Street&quot; (), which was an adaptation of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Menken contributed music for the film &quot;The Line&quot; (1980), directed by Robert J. Siegel.
Menken finally achieved success as a composer when playwright Howard Ashman chose him and Engel to write the music for his musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;. The musical opened in 1979 at the WPA Theater to excellent reviews and modest box office. It transferred after several months to the Off-Broadway Entermedia Theater, where it ran for an additional six weeks. Menken and Ashman wrote their next musical, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, for a cast of only 9 performers, including a puppeteer. This musical is based on the 1960 black comedy film &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. It opened at WPA Theater in 1982 to warm reviews. It moved to the Off Broadway Orpheum Theatre in the East Village, Manhattan, where it ran for five years. The musical set the box-office record for highest grossing Off-Broadway show of all time. It toured around the world, won theater awards and was adapted as a 1986 musical film starring Rick Moranis that earned Menken and Ashman their first Oscar nomination for the song &quot;Mean Green Mother from Outer Space&quot;. For his body of work in musical theatre, he was awarded the BMI Career Achievement Award in 1983.

In 1987, Menken and lyricist David Spencer&#x27;s adaptation &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, based on the 1959 novel of the same name, was produced in Philadelphia. After substantial re-writes, it was produced in 2015 in Montreal. In 1992, the WPA Theatre produced Menken&#x27;s &quot;Weird Romance&quot;, also with lyrics by Spencer. Menken&#x27;s musical based on the Charles Dickens novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and book by Mike Ockrent, debuted at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Paramount Theater in 1994. The show proved successful and was an annual New York holiday event. From 1989 to 1990, Menken and Howard Ashman wrote songs for the popular puppet TV show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In 2008, Menken said that his work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was &quot;pathetic money, but it still had some prestige to it. It was on the air and [he] was getting some royalties&quot;. The duo also wrote a song titled &quot;Wonderful Ways to Say No&quot; for the 1990 animated anti-drug special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;.

=== 1989–2007: Disney Renaissance and Broadway work ===

On the strength of the success of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, Menken and Ashman were hired by Walt Disney Studios to write the music for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). The challenge was to create an animated musical film of this Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that could sit alongside the Disney films &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; opened to critical and commercial success and signaled a new Disney era called the Disney Renaissance. The film gave them their first Academy Award win: Best Song for the song &quot;Under the Sea&quot;. Menken also won the 1989 Academy Award for Best Score. Critic Roger Ebert declared in his review, [the film] contains some of the best Disney music since the glory days.&quot;

Menken and Ashman&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; garnered them three 1991 Academy Award nominations for Best Song, winning for its title song. Menken won another Academy Award for Best Score. The two were working on &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the time of Ashman&#x27;s death in 1991. Ashman wrote only three songs in the film and Menken collaborated with Tim Rice, who was then working on &quot;The Lion King&quot;, to write the rest of the songs for the film. The film won an Academy Award in 1992 for Best Song, &quot;A Whole New World&quot;. Menken also won the Oscar for Best Score. Menken debuted on Broadway with a musical theater adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; that opened in 1994 and ran for 13 years before closing in 2007. In 1997, he collaborated with lyricist Tim Rice on a musical, &quot;King David&quot;, based on the biblical character, which was performed in a concert version on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre. &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; played on Broadway from 2003 to 2004.

Menken&#x27;s live-action musical film &quot;Newsies&quot;, with lyrics by Jack Feldman, was released in 1992. Three more animated musical films followed. Menken collaborated with Stephen Schwartz for &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, for which the two won two Academy Awards: Best Song and Best Musical or Comedy Score. In 1996, the same musical team created the songs, and Menken, the score, for &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. In 1997, Menken reunited with his early collaborator, David Zippel, for his last film in the era, &quot;Hercules&quot;. Menken also wrote the music for the Michael J. Fox vehicle &quot;Life with Mikey&quot; (1993), the holiday film &quot;Noel&quot; (2004) and &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; (2012). His other film scores for Disney have included &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004), the Tim Allen remake of &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), and &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010).

=== 2008–2016: Return to Broadway === 
He next created the stage version of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which played on Broadway from 2008 to 2009 and for which he received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Score. Menken&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;Sister Act&quot; debuted in London in 2009, and opened on Broadway in 2011. He was nominated for another Tony Award for Best Score. Menken received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010. In December 2010, he was a guest on the NPR quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;. In 2012, Menken won a Tony Award for Best Score for his musical adaptation of &quot;Newsies&quot;, which ran until 2014. He also wrote the music for &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, which had a brief run on Broadway in 2012. His stage adaptation of &quot;Aladdin&quot; opened on Broadway in 2014, earning him another Tony nomination for Best Score. In 2013, he was a guest at the annual Junior Theatre Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, and was honored with the Junior Theater Festival Award. He gave a concert there, including music that was cut from various productions, while talking about his creative process. 

Menken&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; played at La Jolla Playhouse, California, in 2014. In 2015, Menken co-composed the score for the musical television series &quot;Galavant&quot; alongside Christopher Lennertz, reuniting him with &quot;Tangled&quot; screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Menken also co-wrote songs for the series alongside Glenn Slater. The series lasted two seasons, first airing on January 4, 2015, and last airing on January 31, 2016. &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; was revived in Montreal in 2015, and &quot;A Bronx Tale: The Musical&quot; played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 2016. Menken is currently working on stage musical adaptations of &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

=== 2017–present: Live-Action Disney films === 
Menken wrote songs for a prospective prequel/spin-off series to 2017&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; titled &quot;Little Town&quot;, which would be centered on Gaston and LeFou. The series would be released on Disney&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+, and Menken would also be an executive-producer on the series. In February 2022, it was reported that the series would not go forward for now. In March 2017, Disney released a live-action adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, with the songs from the 1991 film and new material by Menken and Rice. Menken collaborated with Benj Pasek and Justin Paul on writing new songs for the 2019 live-action version of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, directed by Guy Ritchie. 

As of 2019, Menken reunites with his &quot;Newsies&quot; creators Jack Feldman and Harvey Fierstein to develop a new musical called &quot;Greetings from Niagara Falls&quot;. A reading was held in January 2019; however, there is no word on future plans for the project at this time. In 2017, Menken and Slater returned to write songs for the animated series &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tangled Adventure&quot;, which is set after the events of &quot;Tangled&quot;. The series ended in 2020, after three seasons. On July 26, 2020, Menken and Slater won the Daytime Emmy Award for Original Song in a Children&#x27;s, Young Adult or Animated Program for the song titled &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;.

Menken again worked with Stephen Schwartz to write new songs for &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Enchanted&quot;, Menken also worked on new music for a live-action film adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall, with longtime &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; fan Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom Menken knew since the former&#x27;s childhood, as Miranda went to the same school as Menken&#x27;s niece. Menken is also working alongside former Disney chief creative officer John Lasseter on a project at Skydance Animation. On May 20, 2020, the project was revealed to be Vicky Jenson&#x27;s &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Menken will co-write songs for &quot;Spellbound&quot; alongside collaborated with lyricist Glenn Slater, with whom he worked on &quot;Home on the Range&quot; and &quot;Tangled&quot;. Menken is also reportedly attached to a sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Menken was set to work with Schwartz to write new songs for a remake of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, which Menken would score. However, in May 2023, Menken suggested that the development had been stalled due to the original movie&#x27;s content and themes.

With eight Academy Awards, only composer Alfred Newman (nine wins), art director Cedric Gibbons (11 wins) and Walt Disney (22 wins) have received more Academy Awards than Menken. He is tied for fourth place with late costume designer Edith Head, and currently holds the record for the most wins for a living person.

== Personal life ==
Menken was introduced to ballet dancer Janis Roswick while working with the Downtown Ballet Company. They have been married since November 1972 and live in North Salem, New York with their two daughters, Anna and Nora.

== Artistry and reception ==
Menken described his signature style of songwriting as pop and rock music married with a &quot;theatrical sensibility&quot; derived from working with theatre composers Lehman Engel and Maury Yeston. Darryn King of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; observed that Menken&#x27;s first three Disney films alone demonstrated a wide range of musical genres and styles, namely sea shanties, German cabaret, French music hall, Mozart operetta, and &quot;the Harlem grooves of Fats Waller and Cab Calloway&quot;. Writing for the same publication, Debbie Cuthbertson identified romance, swelling strings, and humour as trademarks of Menken&#x27;s songs. Menken said he prefers his compositions to be &quot;hummable&quot;, and emphasized the importance of creating infectious melodies and rhythms that elicit desired emotions. 

Menken described himself as a chameleon in terms of his composing process. When writing for Disney films in particular, he attempts to progress the story in a manner appropriate for each character and dramatic situation by gathering as much information as possible about the project before composing using a piano. His music his also created prior to the scripts and storyboards. Menken records his own demos using either a straight piano-vocal or piano-vocal-MIDI orchestral arrangement. He maintains that there is little value in writing music that does not elicit strong emotional responses from listeners. Apple Music said the composer&#x27;s work is &quot;Rich with the tones, colors, and textures that help viewers feel those big moments deep in their hearts&quot;. Although he rarely orchestrates or conducts his own work, he produces his film&#x27;s soundtracks and remains in the control room during recording sessions. Menken has written with numerous lyricists throughout his career, his most famous collaboration remaining his songwriting partnership with Ashman, despite having worked together for a relatively short period of time. He initially wrote both music and lyrics and considers himself to be a strong lyricist, but decided to focus on composing upon meeting ashman. He said he enjoys working with different lyricists because &quot;they reflect different dimensions of my career&quot;. Lyricist and frequent collaborator Glenn Slater said Menken is arguably &quot;the greatest melodist that we&#x27;ve had in the theatre and the film world for the past 30 years&quot;.

Steve Hochman of Grammy.com said Menken &quot;ranks among the top composers in film and theater&quot;, writing, &quot;his music is part of the DNA of several generations of children and parents alike&quot;. In 2024, Katcy Stephan of &quot;Variety&quot; said he &quot;he remains one of the industry’s most sought-after songwriters&quot;. &quot;Playbill&quot;&#x27;s Logan Culwell-Block described Menken as &quot;one of musical theatre’s most prolific composers—but what puts him in an elite class is not the quantity of his output, but its quality&quot;. According to Jeff Bond of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Menken is largely responsible for redefining the musical genre for a contemporary audience both in film and on stage, calling him &quot;one of film music’s most versatile craftspeople&quot;. Phil Sweetland of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; credited Menken&#x27;s work for Disney with preserving musical theater after the genre had fallen into decline following the Golden Age of musicals, before its resurgence in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, King observed that, despite his achievements, Menken&#x27;s work is often overlooked and dismissed due to his affiliation with animation and children&#x27;s entertainment. Menken himself has said he dislikes writing specifically for children, despite the target audience of much of his best-known projects, and credits Ashman with teaching him not to write directly to children. Menken explained that &quot;I never write for kids ... I write for myself. I want to tell a story. I want to make those kids feel like I felt when I saw those earlier movies&quot;. His work has influenced a generation of songwriters across film and stage. Menken has noted his influence on songwriters and musicians such as Benj Pasek, Justin Paul, Robert Lopez, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Elton John, and Sara Bareilles, although he maintains he does not have a specific protege. Although Lopez believes Menken can practically do anything, he possesses in particular &quot;a God-given gift for a heartfelt emotional melody that will bring tears to your eyes&quot;.

Menken is an EGOT winner, having won at least one Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony for his work.

Alan Menken has received eight Academy Awards (and nineteen nominations), becoming the second most prolific Oscar winner in the music categories after Alfred Newman (who has 9 Oscars), eleven Grammy Awards (and twenty-four nominations), one Tony Award (and four nominations), and one Daytime Emmy Award. He has also received seven Golden Globe Awards (and sixteen nominations), one Drama Desk Award (and five nominations), and three Outer Critics Awards. Four of Menken&#x27;s songs have won both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award in a songwriting category (either Song Of The Year or Best Song Written Specifically For A Motion Picture Or For Television).

He was made a Disney Legend in 2002 and was the recipient of a Richard Kirk Career Achievement Award in 1998, a Freddie G. Award for Musical Excellence in 2013, and The Oscar Hammerstein Award in 2013, among others.

The American Film Institute included the title song from the film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, in the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs. Five other songs from his Disney films were nominated:

* &quot;Under the Sea&quot; from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991)

* &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992)

In 2006, AFI listed its 25 greatest movie musicals, with &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) ranked 22nd. It is the only animated musical film on the list. Four of his other film musicals were also nominated:
* &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986)
* &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992)

In 2019, Menken finally accepted the Razzie Award for &quot;Worst Original Song&quot; he won at the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards (1993) for &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot; from &quot;Newsies&quot; (1992), becoming the first person to win a Razzie and Oscar in the same year. Menken wrote the music for the song, and shared the award with lyricist Jack Feldman.

In 2020, Menken reached EGOT status when he won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song in a Children&#x27;s, Young Adult or Animated Program for co-writing the song &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot; for &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tangled Adventure&quot;.

<text>Azusa Pacific University (APU) is a private evangelical research university in Azusa, California. The university was founded in 1899, with classes opening on March 3, 1900, in Whittier, California, and began offering degrees in 1939. The university&#x27;s seminary, the Graduate School of Theology, holds to a Wesleyan-Arminian doctrinal theology. APU offers more than 100 associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs on campus, online, and at seven regional locations across Southern California.

Azusa Pacific University is organized into three colleges and seven schools. The academics programs are available from the Honors College, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Music and the Arts, Leung School of Accounting, University College, School of Behavioral and Applied Sciences, School of Business and Management, School of Education, School of Nursing, and School of Theology. APU is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission.

==History==
Azusa Pacific University was established on March 3, 1899, in Whittier, California. Under the name Training School for Christian Workers, it was the first Bible college on the West Coast. Led by president Mary A. Hill, the school initially had a total enrollment of 12 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.apu.edu/about/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Early years saw the school relocate and change leadership several times. In 1939, Cornelius P. Haggard became the school&#x27;s 13th president. In response to low enrollment and a lack of donations, Haggard launched a variety of fundraising efforts. Haggard served for the next 36 years.

Following mergers with three Southern California colleges, the university relocated in 1946 to the city of Azusa, where it resides today. In 1939 the Training School became Pacific Bible College, and four-year degrees were offered. In 1956, the name was changed to Azusa College. By 1965, Azusa College had become Azusa-Pacific College (APC), and three years later, APC merged with Arlington College. Upon its achievement of university status in 1981, the college changed its name to Azusa Pacific University.

After Haggard&#x27;s death, Paul E. Sago became president, serving until 1989. Sago encouraged the development and growth of off-site educational regional campuses throughout Southern California, and presided over the addition of master&#x27;s degree programs and the development of schools within the university.

Richard E. Felix, became president in 1990, and initiated the university&#x27;s first doctoral programs. He also introduced the university&#x27;s &quot;Four Cornerstones,&quot; Christ, Scholarship, Community, and Service, and oversaw the construction of seven new buildings, a doubling of student enrollment, and a quadrupling of graduate programs.

When nearby institution, Ambassador College closed in 1997, the Worldwide Church of God and Azusa Pacific University jointly established the &quot;Ambassador Center&quot; at Azusa Pacific University for the continuation of classes for former Ambassador College students.

In November 2000, then-Executive Vice President Jon R. Wallace, DBA, became president. In April 2018, Wallace announced his plan to retire and accepted his new role as president emeritus.

In 2017, a new independent economic study found that APU generates $1.25 billion in economic impact within California each year. Of that, APU contributes $37 million in state taxes each year and supports 7,260 jobs statewide. The report also found approximately 47,500 APU alumni reside within California, increasing the state&#x27;s productivity and earning power. Of those, 10,600 APU alumni and 600 APU employees live in the San Gabriel Valley.

In 2018, two university board members resigned from the university, citing concerns over financial mismanagement and &quot;theological drift.&quot; As of 2018, the credit rating agency Moody&#x27;s had downgraded its credit rating of APU&#x27;s bonds to BA1, just above junk status.

On April 10, 2019, APU named Paul W. Ferguson as its 17th president. He began his new role on June 3, 2019.

=== Religious affiliations ===
A small group of Quakers (also known as Friends) and a Methodist evangelist laid the foundation for the Training School for Christian Workers in 1899.

As faculty members began to embrace Evangelicalism and reject a growing liberal trend in the California Yearly Meeting of Friends, a campus church was established in 1933. This shift moved the &quot;school church&quot; from the local Huntington Park Friends Church to the on-campus worship gathering. The new campus church planted eight &quot;tabernacles&quot; throughout California which collectively became known as the Evangel Church denomination.

The series of college mergers and campus re-locations which followed helped to solidify the school&#x27;s identity as an Evangelical institution.

===Presidents===
The university has had a total of 18 presidents since its founding.

More than 703,000 microforms include the Library of American Civilization, Library of American Literature, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Educational Resources Information Center collections. The university network also provides access to more than 140 online databases, which include more than 46,000 electronic journals.

In the fall of 2009, Azusa Pacific University acquired a collection of antiquities, including five fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls and five first-edition prints of the King James Bible. These new acquisitions were displayed in an exhibit, Treasures of the Bible: The Dead Sea Scrolls and Beyond, in summer 2010.

<doc id="479171" wikidata="Q611748" url="?curid=479171" title="Commodity Futures Trading Commission">
<text>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent agency of the US government created in 1974 that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, which includes futures, swaps, and certain kinds of options.

The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), &quot;et seq.&quot;, prohibits fraudulent conduct in the trading of futures, swaps, and other derivatives. The stated mission of the CFTC is to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation. After the financial crisis of 2007–08 and since 2010 with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFTC has been transitioning to bring more transparency and sound regulation to the multitrillion-dollar swaps market.

==History==

Futures contracts for agricultural commodities have been traded in the U.S. for more than 150 years and have been under federal regulation since the 1920s. The Grain Futures Act of 1922 set the basic authority and was changed by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).

Since the 1970s, trading in futures contracts has rapidly expanded beyond traditional physical and agricultural commodities into a vast array of financial instruments, including foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices.

Congress created the CFTC in 1974 as an independent federal regulatory agency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-463) created the CFTC to replace the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Commodity Exchange Authority. The Act made extensive changes to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936, which itself amended the original Grain Futures Act of 1922. (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). In 1975, the first members were selected, and John T. O&#x27;Hara became its first chairman.

The CFTC&#x27;s mandate was renewed and expanded in December 2000 when Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which instructed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to develop a joint regulatory regime for single-stock futures, the products of which began trading in November 2002.

In 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act expanded the CFTC&#x27;s regulatory authority into the swaps markets. The swaps markets currently have a notional value of more than $400 trillion.

==Regulated markets==

The CFTC oversees the derivatives markets by encouraging their competitiveness and efficiency, ensuring their integrity, protecting market participants against manipulation, abusive trading practices, fraud, and ensuring the financial integrity of the clearing process. The CFTC generally does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for whom it sets capital standards pursuant to Dodd–Frank. Through oversight, the CFTC enables the derivatives markets to serve the function of price discovery and offsetting price risk.

As of 2014 the CFTC oversees &#x27;designated contract markets&#x27; (DCMs) or exchanges, swap execution facilities (SEFs), derivatives clearing organizations, swap data repositories (SDRs), swap dealers, futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators and other intermediaries. The CFTC coordinates its work with foreign regulators, such as its UK counterpart, the Financial Conduct Authority, which supervises the London Metal Exchange.

===Over-the-counter derivatives===

In 1998 CFTC chairperson Brooksley E. Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of &#x27;off-exchange markets&#x27; for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in addition to its existing oversight of exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were opposed by other regulators.

Two actions by the CFTC in 1998 led some market participants to express concerns that the CFTC might modify the &quot;Swap Exemption&quot; and attempt to impose new regulations on the swaps market. First, in a February 1998 comment letter addressing the SEC&#x27;s &quot;broker-dealer lite&quot; proposal, the CFTC stated that the SEC&#x27;s proposal would create the potential for conflict with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to the extent that certain OTC derivative instruments fall within the ambit of the CEA and are subject to the exclusive statutory authority of the CFTC.

In May 1998 the CFTC issued a &#x27;concept release&#x27; requesting comment on whether regulation of OTC derivatives markets was appropriate and, if so, what form such regulation should take. Legislation enacted in 1999 at the request of the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the SEC limited the CFTC&#x27;s rulemaking authority with respect to swaps and hybrid instruments until March 30, 1999, and froze the pre-existing legal status of swap agreements and hybrid instruments entered into in reliance on the &#x27;Swap Exemption&#x27;, the &#x27;Hybrid Instrument Rule&#x27;, the &#x27;Swap Policy Statement, or the &#x27;Hybrid Interpretation&#x27;. The text of that act read: &quot;...the Commission may not propose or issue any rule or regulation, or issue any interpretation or policy statement, that restricts or regulates activity in a qualifying hybrid instrument or swap agreement&quot;. Shortly after Congress had passed this legislation prohibiting CFTC from regulating derivatives, Born resigned. She later commented the failure of Long-Term Capital Management and the subsequent bailout as being indicative what she had been trying to prevent.

In March 2014 the CFTC acknowledged it was considering the regulation of Bitcoin. The CFTC has since taken the position that Bitcoin is a commodity under the CEA. In October 2019, former CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert, now Chief Legal Officer of Citadel Securities, declared that ether was also a commodity under the CEA.

In 2015, the CFTC ruled that for purposes of trading, cryptocurrencies were legally classified as commodities. However, in view of market volatility and other factors, the CFTC noted several risks associated with trading virtual currencies. In 2017, the CFTC cited the US SEC&#x27;s warning against digital token sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that can &quot;improperly entice investors with promises of high returns&quot;. In recent years, the CFTC has expanded its efforts to civilly prosecute fraud and misappropriation in the digital asset markets.

==Organization==
Based in Washington, D.C., the CFTC maintains regional offices in Chicago, New York and Kansas City, Missouri. The Commission consists of five Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States to serve staggered five-year terms. The commissioners may continue to serve until their successor is confirmed, but not beyond the expiration of the next session of Congress subsequent to the expiration their term. The President, with the consent of the United States Senate, designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairman. No more than three commissioners at any one time may be from the same political party.

===Major operating units===

====Division of Enforcement====
The Division of Enforcement (DOE) investigates and prosecutes alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Violations may involve commodity futures or option trading on domestic commodity exchanges, or the improper marketing of commodity investments. The Division may, at the direction of the commission, file complaints before the agency&#x27;s administrative law judges or in the U.S. District Courts. Alleged criminal violations of the Commodity Exchange Act or violations of other Federal laws which involve commodity futures trading may be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. The Division also provides expert help and technical assistance with case development and trials to U.S. Attorneys&#x27; Offices, other Federal and state regulators, and international authorities.

==== Division of Market Oversight ====
The Division of Market Oversight (DMO) has regulatory responsibility for initial recognition and continuing oversight of trade execution facilities, including new registered futures exchanges, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories. The regulatory functions of the Division include, among other things, rule enforcement reviews, reviews of new products and product- and market-related rule amendments, and associated product and market-related studies. The Division was previously responsible for market and trade practice surveillance.

====Market Participants Division====
Formerly known as the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, the Market Participants Division (MPD) primarily oversees derivatives market intermediaries, including commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, major swap participants, retail foreign exchange dealers, and swap dealers, as well as designated self-regulatory organizations. MPD conducts the registration, compliance, and business conduct standards of intermediaries, swap dealers and major swap participants. The division also oversees the agency&#x27;s customer education initiatives.

====Division of Clearing and Risk====
The Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) oversees derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) and other market participants in the clearing process. These include futures commission merchants, swap dealers, major swap participants, and large traders. DCR monitors the clearing of futures, options on futures, and swaps by DCOs, assesses DCO compliance with Commission regulations, and conducts risk assessment and surveillance. DCR also makes recommendations on DCO applications and eligibility, rule submissions, and which types of swaps should be cleared. As of 2019, Clark Hutchison serves as Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk.

===Notable events of past commissioners===
Roy Lavik served as the CFTC (Commodity Futures and Trading Commission) Inspector General from 1990 until 2023. On May 3, 2023, the Wall Street Journal Reports that Mr. Lavik was suspended by the CFTC as the Inspector General after an oversight body alleging &quot;Substantial Misconduct&quot;. Complaints of misconduct go back as far as late 2018. Allegations include:

* Divulging the identity of whistleblowers on multiple occasions
* Misappropriating around $165,000 in funds for a hire that did little or no work
* Violating agency security policies by allowing others to use his username and password to access sensitive systems

==Funding/budget==
Unlike the other four main financial regulators, the CFTC does not have self-funding. A transaction fee has been &quot;requested&quot; for several years but Congress has not taken any legislative action. During the government shut down in October 2013, SEC and Federal Reserve stayed open, but &quot;futures and most swaps markets were left with essentially no cop on the beat&quot;.

In 2007, the CFTC&#x27;s budget was and it had 437 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). After 2008, funding increased by 80% to and 687 FTEs for fiscal year (FY) 2012, but was cut to and 682 FTEs for FY 2013. In 2013 CFTC&#x27;s performance was severely affected by limited resources and had to delay cases. The current, FY 2014 funding of did not keep up with CFTC&#x27;s increasing swaps market oversight and regulation, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in formerly dark market trading, according to outgoing Commissioner Bart Chilton in his last speech. The Obama administration&#x27;s latest budget proposal for FY 2015 requested , which is less than the request for the previous year, and would fund &quot;100 less employees than we need&quot; per Chilton, who called the budget &quot;woefully insufficient&quot; for CFTC&#x27;s more than 40-fold increased purview.
In February 2014, Commissioner Scott D. O&#x27;Malia dissented from the FY 2014 spending plan saying that it did not allocate enough funding to new technology investments, but allocated too much to swap dealer oversight, duplicating the work of the self-regulatory National Futures Association. In March he dissented from the FY 2015 budget request stating CFTC &quot;makes an unrealistic request for new staff and funding in this budget request without a firm understanding of its mission priorities, specific goals, and corresponding personnel and technology needs.&quot;

In December 2019, the CFTC secured funding of for FY2020, an increase of nearly 6 percent from the appropriated for FY2019. Chairman Tarbert commented that this &quot;fully matched&quot; the CFTC&#x27;s request, the first time that had happened in &quot;nearly a decade.&quot;

<text>Orșova (; ; ; ) is a port city on the Danube river in southwestern Romania&#x27;s Mehedinți County. It is one of four localities in the Banat historical region situated just above the Iron Gates where the Cerna River meets the Danube.

== History ==

* The locality was the site of a Roman port in Dacia Malvensis, and the site of the Roman city and fort of Dierna
* In 1925, a confusion by the scholar Nándor Fettich misplaced the important Magyar burial site discovered at Cheglevici into the Orșova region. Later, the location of that discovery, testifying to the presence of the Magyars since the early 10th century, was clarified for the archeological community.
* King Ladislaus I of Hungary decisively defeated the Cumans near Orșova in 1091.
* It was a major border fortification in the Middle Ages.
* The city was captured by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1522.
* Orșova became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1687 at the start of an Ottoman-Habsburg War, but Ottoman forces recaptured it in 1690. The Treaty of Passarowitz gave the city back to the Kingdom of Hungary in 1718. The Treaty of Belgrade gave the city back to the Ottoman Empire in 1739. Finally, The Treaty of Sistova gave the city back to the Kingdom of Hungary in 1791. The city remained in Hungary until the end of World War I, when it became part of Romania. It was included in the Mehedinți county during the administrative reform of 1968.
* The Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen was buried near Orșova from 1848 till 1853.
* During the works at the Iron Gates, the old center of the town was flooded and Orșova was developed (1966–1971) on higher ground, including the southern side of the Almăj Mountain and the villages of Jupalnic, Tufari, and Coramnic. Also flooded then was the neighboring Ada Kaleh, with the scattering of the mostly Turkish community of the Danube island. Ada Kaleh and its inhabitants, as well as the ancient city, are still present in the memory of its surviving locals.

==Economy==
The town is a center for the extraction of bentonite, chromium, and granite. The industry is centered on energy production (the hydroelectric plant), shipbuilding and engine manufacturing, assembly parts for electricity production, textiles, and the processing of feldspar, asbestos, quartz, talc, wood, etc.

The Orșova shipyard was constructed in 1890 and like a small reparation shop for the vessels which participated to the navigable channel from Iron Gate Romania- Sip Yugoslavia and had a continuously development a long time. After the year 1991 the name was changed and also the organizational profile.

A wind farm is being developed in the city territory, on a hill nearby (at 4.5 km from the agglomeration); the first turbines became active there in 2009.

<text>National Freedom to Marry Day is a non-official United States holiday held annually on February 12 to promote same-sex marriage. The holiday was founded in 1998 by Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy law firm based out of Washington, DC.

The most notable National Freedom to Marry Day was February 12, 2004, when, following a directive from San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom to his county clerk, the City and County of San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On February 10, Newsom asked the clerk&#x27;s office to make the changes on the &quot;forms and documents used to apply for and issue marriage licenses… in order to provide [them] on a non–discriminatory basis.&quot;

February 12, the same day of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday, is a day for people to think about love and equality. Many LGBTQ+ people want to get married this day in order to commemorate their love, just two days before Valentine&#x27;s Day. &quot;Tying the Knot&quot; can be shown by tying a knot around trees, lamp posts, signs, or anywhere else that can be easily seen.

<doc id="479185" wikidata="Q1825736" url="?curid=479185" title="Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles">
<text>Lincoln Heights is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, California, United States. It was originally called &quot;East Los Angeles&quot; from 1873 to 1917. It is a densely populated, mostly Latino and Asian neighborhood that includes many historic landmarks and was known as &quot;the Bedroom of the Pueblo.&quot; 

==History==

Yaangna Village was located on what is now the current day site of Downey Park on Albion and Avenue 17. Lincoln Heights is considered to be one of the oldest neighborhoods outside of La Placita / Sonoratown dating to the 1870s and is found wholly within the original Spanish four leagues pueblo of the Los Angeles land grant. Located on bluffs overlooking the Los Angeles River and immersed in the floodplain, Lincoln Heights river adjacent land became the city&#x27;s first Industrial Corridor. Aided by slave labor of the Kizh, it later became the home to some of the city&#x27;s most notable downtown industrialists, who built numerous Victorian homes, some of which have been preserved under the city&#x27;s historic preservation ordinance.

In 1863, John Strother Griffin purchased of ranch land for $1,000 and in 1870, Griffin and his nephew, Hancock Johnson, built homes there. In late 1874, they offered an additional for sale, subdivided into lots for $150 each. The neighborhood was known as &quot;East Los Angeles&quot; between 1873 and 1917 when residents voted to change the name to Lincoln Heights.

The area was the first suburban neighborhood of Los Angeles, having been subdivided in 1873. Lincoln Heights was well located to serve as a home for people who worked in the industrial areas lining the Los Angeles River and wanted to live upstream. By the late 1880s a neighborhood commercial district had been built around the intersection of North Broadway and Truman Streets, with business buildings such as the Hayden Block. This is identified as the first suburban neighborhood shopping district in Los Angeles; it was demolished in the mid-20th century to make way for I-5, the Golden State Freeway.

Thereafter, what would be known as North Broadway became a crowded commercial thoroughfare, and by the turn of the 20th century, unfettered industrial construction and numerous rock crushing operations within the once scenic floodplain made it less appealing for Angelenos of means, who moved out first to the Arroyo Seco area and Hollywood, then (from the 1920s onward) to rapidly developing Mid-Wilshire. As wealthy residents departed, Lincoln Heights became home to a large Italian American population, as well as some Irish American and French American (the 1850s era immigration) residents by the 1930s, also a wave of poor white American residents known as &quot;Okies&quot; from the Great Plains moved into the area. With an increasingly large Mexican American population, Lincoln Heights became a &quot;barrio&quot; by the 1960s. It and its cross-river neighbor &quot;Little Italy&quot; (what is now Chinatown) formed the heart of southern California&#x27;s Italian-American community.

In the 21st century, Lincoln Heights has slowly been gentrifying due to Los Angeles&#x27; land use policies.

==Demographics==

Based on the 2019 Census estimates, Lincoln Heights has a population of 39,916 residents.

The neighborhood has a relatively high percentage of both Latino and Asian residents. The breakdown was Latinos, 66.2%; Asians, 23.4%; whites, 7.8%; blacks, 0.4%; and others, 1.0%. Mexico (57.0%) and Vietnam (16.9%) were the most common places of birth for the 55.8% of the residents who were born abroad—which was a high percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $30,579, considered low for the city. Renters occupied 75.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 24.1%. The average household size of 3.6 people was considered high for Los Angeles.

The percentages of never-married men (53.0%) and women (40.6%) were among the county&#x27;s highest. The 19.5% of families headed by single parents was considered about average for city neighborhoods. There were 500 veterans, or 2.8% of the population, a low proportion compared to the rest of the city.

Lincoln Heights ranks in the 94th-100th percentile of environmentally burdened communities according to CalEnviroScreen 4.0

<doc id="479186" wikidata="Q15063403" url="?curid=479186" title="Confrontation (Rackham)">
<text>Confrontation is a skirmish level tactical fantasy miniature wargaming in which the combatants are represented by metal or plastic figures in 28 mm scale. For comparison purposes, the system&#x27;s figures are slightly larger than those of Games Workshop or The Foundry.

The game is set in Aarklash, a world of medieval fantasy where knights, wizards, priests and barbarians fight each other as well as fantastic creatures such as wolfen, elves, orcs, goblins and the undead. The entire world is at war and all are fighting for the supremacy of the continent.

The rules are intended to be versatile, and are able to represent a small fight between a handful of warriors just as well as a large skirmish between several dozen soldiers and their leaders. The last rules were in its fourth edition, a single hardback edition. The first edition was only available in French, German and Italian, while the second was available in French, German, Italian, English and Spanish. Rackham collapsed in 2010.

==Playing the game==
Each player in the game needs to acquire several miniatures to represent his forces. Miniatures are bought in blister packs, each containing one or more metal figures, a booklet of basic game rules, and a special reference card that describes the characteristics and special abilities of the game pieces. A photo or artist&#x27;s drawing of the figures is on the reverse of the reference card, as a painting guide for the hobbyist.

Several six-sided dice and a table with scale scenery to play on are also needed.

==The Miniatures==
Rackham originally produced metal miniatures for Confrontation in blisters of one to four models, or boxed sets of one to eight models.

===Confrontation: Age of Ragnarok===
With the release of &quot;Confrontation: Age of Ragnarok&quot;, Rackham changed the supporting miniature line from unpainted metal figures to pre-painted plastic figures. This follows the production model used in &quot;AT-43&quot;, their science fiction miniatures game. The models were packaged in multiple figure sets that correspond with units and auxiliaries as described in the various army lists.

==Factions==
The Akkylannie Griffons are a fanatical army of humans that worship Merin, the God of Fire, spreading their truth through fire and sword. The Griffon army is characterized by heavily armoured troops, high Discipline, strong ranged weapons, and powerful Faithful. The Alchemists of Dirz were founded by a high priest of Merin who was so consumed with attaining perfection that he began dark experiments combining man and science. Dirz soldiers tend to have better attack stats with the possibility of boosting their abilities with their Mutagen. The Kelt Drunes are a tribe of human barbarians dwell within the heart of a dark forest. The Devourers of Vile-Tis are Wolfen who have separated from the rest of their race. Devourers have high Movement, Resilience, and Defence with above average Strength making very dangerous and hard to kill. There were also Dwarven, Goblin, Undead, Orc and Elven factions.

==Editions of the game==
===First Edition===
Confrontation can be played with the basic rules alone, but there are several supplements available. These describe optional rules and multiply the tactical options allowed. All are packed free in the appropriate blisters, just like the basic rules.

Incantation introduces powerful Wizards to the game. In this supplement a new characteristic appears: Mental Strength. Mental Strength is the essential element used to call upon the power of Magic. Wizards can use that power to change the course of battle: project fire balls, raise the dead and even invoke powerful spirits. Every blister that contains a Wizard includes a free Incantation Rules Booklet as well as cards that describe magic items and special spells particular to each. A small plate of counters representing &#x27;Mana&#x27;, the very essence of Magic, is also included. &#x27;Grimoires,&#x27; packs of 15 additional spell cards, are available separately.

Incarnation allows players to individualize their game characters. Special &#x27;Adventurer&#x27; figures are furnished with the Incarnation Rules Booklet which details how they progress in experience. The character acquires power, fame, new abilities and magic objects as he accomplishes quests. Two new types of cards are packed in the Adventurer blisters: Scenarios and Experience Cards. Each Adventurer is furnished with a scenario specially written for him. Scenarios card packs are also available separately. Many scenarios based on the official characters of the range are available free on the Confrontation web site (in French). &#x27;Travel Journals,&#x27; packs of cards for treasures, rare objects or magic artifacts, are available to further customize scenarios.

=== Second Edition ===
Divination addresses the gods themselves and their servants, the faithful Priests that represent them on the battlefields. The magic of the Priests is powerful but variable, for it depends on the vagaries of the fickle gods. It also tends to be more defensive in nature than Wizards&#x27; magic. The blisters of the Priests figures are packaged with the Divination Rules Booklet and several &#x27;Miracle&#x27; cards to call upon the aid of the divine powers. The &#x27;Litanies&#x27; card packs group together additional miracle cards.

Fortification adds in war machines such as cannon, ballista, and chariots. Some of the existing figures, such as the Dwarf Steam Cannon are reclassified to war machines.

===Third Edition===
The third edition of Confrontation was issued as both basic rules, included in miniature blisters, and as a hardback bound advanced rules. The basic rules described combat and movement, but did not explain abilities or magic. The advanced rules included all rules from the second edition with some refinements in play.

One notable aspect of the third edition was its obsolescence of the adventure, spell, and miracle card packs. The reworked magic rules in the third edition significantly reduced the number of available spells by eliminating the previously released spell books. The book also includes an extensive section covering the changes to the existing model line and associated cards.

The unbalancing army cards were removed in this edition. Also removed was the declarable target number while making attack die rolls. Separate shooting and magic phases were also done away with. Now the round is based on only 4 phases with shooting taking place in the activation and magic being used throughout the round dictated by card text.

An on-line only revision was published within a year of the publication of the third edition. Called &quot;Confrontation 3.5&quot;, this revision changed some abilities, reworked the line of sight rules, and changed the way spells and miracles were added to a force by removing points costs from them. This update also significantly changed the balance of ranged units by giving them the abilities &quot;Bull&#x27;s eye&quot; and &quot;Assault fire&quot; and giving units that already had those abilities &quot;cookies&quot; to improve them. Dogs of War was the only supplement for Confrontation Third Edition.

===Fourth Edition===
The fourth edition of Confrontation was named &quot;Confrontation: Age of Ragnarok&quot;. This edition made major changes to the rules, including changing the game scope from single-model skirmish to small unit battle. As with second edition, Confrontation: Age of Ragnarok has re-issued the game cards to reflect the new rules and statistics.

==Supplements==
===Dogs of War===
&quot;Dogs of War&quot; was the supplement to Confrontation, third edition. It provides campaign rules that allow players to create small warbands that gain experience and improve as they are fielded in the games. These personalized warbands can be played in games of Confrontation or Rag&#x27;Narok, though they are not sanctioned for official tournaments. In addition, Dogs of War includes expanded terrain rules, rules for Nexi, scenario rules, and rules for very large models, called Titans. Dogs of War is not suitable for earlier editions of the game.

===Cry Havoc! Magazine===
&quot;Cry Havoc!&quot;, originally offered as a quarterly magazine, is available six times a year and is published by Rackham that includes information about its different games. The publication includes two magazines and new reference cards. The larger magazine has general articles on painting and modeling, as well as features on the games, tactics articles, battle reports, and background information on the world of Aarklash. The second magazine consists of play aids, variant rules, and scenarios. The reference cards supplement and augment the articles in the two magazines. These cards are not available separately.

==Other related games==
===Rag&#x27;Narok===
&quot;Rag&#x27;Narok&quot; is at once an evolution of the basic game and an entirely new one. Where the basic game represents small confrontations and skirmishes, in Rag&#x27;Narok entire armies are involved in battles. Rag&#x27;Narok uses exactly the same basic resources as Confrontation (figures, cards and game characteristics), but the rules differ somewhat to accommodate the change in scope and keep the game manageable. &quot;Confrontation: Age of Ragnarok&quot; is a melding of the earlier versions of Confrontation with Rag&#x27;narok.

===Hybrid===
&quot;Hybrid&quot; and its expansion &quot;Nemesis&quot; is a board game set in the world of Aarklash. The game is played on illustrated tiles arranged to form the floor plan of the underground laboratories of the Alchemists of Dirz. Players take the role of either the denizens of these laboratories or the outside forces invading them to either steal their secrets or shut them down. The rules of this subgame resemble Space Hulk somewhat. The game uses a subset of the figures but with different reference cards.

===Cadwallon===
Unlike the miniatures wargame &quot;Confrontation&quot;, &quot;Cadwallon&quot; is a role-playing game. It uses the same setting of Aarklash and the same miniatures as other games in the Rackham line, and illustrated tiles could be purchased on which to play. &quot;Cadwallon&quot; was designed in 2006 by Jean Bey, co-founder of Rackham. A novel set in Cadwallon, &quot;Les Cendres de la Colère&quot; (&quot;The Ashes of Anger&quot;) by Mathieu Gaborit, was also published by Rackham. A total of six supplements for &quot;Cadwallon&quot; were published by Rackham from 2006 to 2008.

===Arcana===
A card game set in the city of Cadwallon.

===Cadwallon:City of Thieves===
A fast paper board game developed by Rackham and released by Fantasy Flight Games. Each player plays a gang of thieves and try to score highest thievery at the end of &#x27;night&#x27;. An expansion named &#x27;Cadwallon: City of Thieves - The King of Ashes&#x27; released for the game as well as some DLC by Fantasy Flight Games. 
A video game adaptation of the board game released by the same name for iPad and iPhone.

===Guilds of Cadwallon===
A tactical card and miniature game set in the city of Cadwallon, published by CoolMiniOrNot in 2013. The playing area consists of a 3x3 (or larger, depending on the number of players) grid of randomized cards, each representing a city district. Players compete for control of these districts with careful placement of their figures, and scoring is based on both the number of assets a player controls as well as how specialized those assets are in any given guild.

==The Confederations==
The Confederations are a non-profit corporations set up in various countries to help expand the player base for Rackham&#x27;s games. They work together as sister organizations, coordinating global tournaments and leagues. They also run tournaments, leagues, and demonstrations of the games in their own countries. Membership in the confederations is open to anyone in their region. For an annual fee, a member has access to purchase exclusive Confederation miniatures as well as the ability to be ranked both nationally and internationally.

<doc id="479187" wikidata="Q14966" url="?curid=479187" title="Port Pirie">
<text>Port Pirie is a small city on the east coast of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, north of the state capital, Adelaide. Port Pirie is the largest city and the main retail centre of the Mid North region of South Australia. The city has an expansive history which dates back to 1845. Port Pirie was the first proclaimed regional city in South Australia, and is currently the second most important and second busiest port in SA.

At the 2021 Census, Port Pirie had a population of 13,896. Port Pirie is the eighth most populous city in South Australia after Adelaide, Mount Gambier, Gawler, Mount Barker, Whyalla, Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln.

The city&#x27;s economy is dominated by one of the world&#x27;s largest lead smelters, operated by Nyrstar. It also produces refined silver, copper, acid, gold and various other by-products. 

In 2014, the smelter underwent a $650 million upgrade, of which $291 million was underwritten by the state government to replace some of the old existing plant and to reduce airborne lead emissions drastically. Regardless of these upgrades, blood lead levels in young children continue to rise. In 2021 a report from the South Australian Health Department found an average blood level of 7.3 mg/dL in young children, compared to a finding of 5.3 mg/dL in 2014, and an upward trend of airborne lead levels.

==History==
Prior to British settlement, the location that became Port Pirie was occupied by the indigenous tribe of Nukunu. The location was called &#x27;Tarparrie&#x27;, which is suspected to mean &quot;Muddy Creek&quot;. The first European to see the location was Matthew Flinders in 1802, as he explored the Spencer Gulf by boat. The first land discovery of the location by a European was by the explorer Edward Eyre, who explored regions around Port Augusta. John Horrocks also discovered a pass through the Flinders Ranges to the coast, now named &quot;Horrocks Pass&quot;.

The town was originally called Samuel&#x27;s Creek after the discovery of Muddy Creek by Samuel Germein. In 1846, Port Pirie Creek was named by Governor Robe after the , the first vessel to navigate the creek when transporting sheep from Bowman&#x27;s Run near Crystal Brook. In 1848, Matthew Smith and Emanuel Solomon bought and subdivided it as a township to be known as Port Pirie. Little development occurred on site and by the late 1860s there were only three woolsheds on the riverfront.

The locality was surveyed as a government town in December 1871 by Charles Hope Harris. The thoroughfares and streets were named after the family of George Goyder, Surveyor General of South Australia. In 1873, the land of Solomon and Smith was re-surveyed and named Solomontown. On 28 September 1876, with a population of 947, Port Pirie was declared a municipality.

With the discovery of rich ore bearing silver, lead and zinc at Broken Hill in 1883, and the completion of a narrow gauge railway from Port Pirie to close to the Broken Hill field in 1888, the economic activities of the town underwent profound change. In 1889 a lead smelter was built by the British Blocks company to treat the Broken Hill ore. BHP initially leased the smelter from British Blocks but began constructing its own smelter from 1892. In 1913, the Russian consul-general Alexander Abaza reported that Port Pirie had a population of more than 500 Russians, mostly Ossetians, who had come to work at the smelter. At that time the town supported a Russian-language school and library.

In 1915, the smelter was taken over by Broken Hill Associated Smelters (BHAS) – a joint venture of companies operating in Broken Hill. Led by the Collins House Group, by 1934 BHAS became the biggest lead smelter in the world. The smelter gradually passed to Pasminco, then Zinifex, and since 2007 has been operated by Nyrstar.

In 1921, the town&#x27;s population had grown to 9,801, living in 2,308 occupied dwellings. By this date, there were 62 boarding houses to cater for the labour demands at the smelter, and the increasingly busy waterfront.

During World War II (1941-1943), a Bombing and Gunnery school (2BAGS) was established by the Royal Air Force at Port Pirie. 22 men lost their lives there during training exercises. It was re-designated the 3 Aerial Observers School (3AOS) in December 1943.

Port Pirie was declared South Australia&#x27;s first provincial city in 1953, and today it is South Australia&#x27;s second-largest port.

==Geography==
Port Pirie is at an elevation of 4 metres above sea level. It is approximately inland, on the Pirie River, which is a tidal saltwater inlet from Spencer Gulf. It is on the coastal plain between Spencer Gulf to the west, and the Flinders Ranges to the east.

===Climate===
Port Pirie has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat wetter winters. The town is above Goyder&#x27;s Line, and is surrounded by mallee scrub. Temperatures vary throughout the year, with average maxima ranging from in January to in July, and average minima fluctuating between in February and in July. Annual precipitation is low, averaging , with a maximum in winter. There are 78.3 precipitation days, 125.0 clear days and 100.0 cloudy days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 4 January 1979 to on 27 June 1958. 

==Transport==
Port Pirie is off the Augusta Highway. It is serviced by Port Pirie Airport, six kilometres south of the city.

=== Railways ===
The first railway in Port Pirie opened in 1875 when the South Australian Railways gauge Port Pirie-Cockburn line opened to Gladstone, ultimately being extended to Broken Hill. The original Ellen Street station was located on the street with the track running down the middle. The station today is occupied by the Port Pirie National Trust Museum.

In 1937, it became a break-of-gauge station when the broad gauge Adelaide-Redhill line was extended to Port Pirie. At the same time the Commonwealth Railways standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway was extended south from Port Augusta to terminate at the new Port Pirie Junction station where it met the broad gauge line, in the suburb of Solomontown.

As far back as 1943, a plan existed to build a new station to remove trains from Ellen Street. As part of the gauge conversion of the Port Pirie to Broken Hill line, Mary Elie Street station was built to replace both Ellen Street and Port Pirie Junction stations.

When opened, the new station was the meeting point for the Commonwealth Railways and South Australian Railways networks with through trains changing locomotives and crews, so the disadvantages were not as notable. However, after both became part of Australian National in July 1975 and trains began to operate in and out with the same locomotives, trains began to operate via Coonamia station on the outskirts of the city.

Mary Ellie Street station was eventually closed in the 1990s and in 2009 was redeveloped as the city&#x27;s library. Until 2012, a GM class locomotive and three carriages were stabled at the platform.

A freight line continues to operate into Port Pirie, feeding the metals plant with raw materials from Broken Hill, and transporting the processed material to Adelaide. This line is managed by Bowmans Rail.

=== Sea transport ===

Port Pirie&#x27;s marine facilities, managed by Flinders Ports, handle up to 100 ship visits annually, up to Handymax size, for commodities such as mineral concentrates, refined lead and zinc, coal, grain, and general cargo.

=== Bridge to nowhere ===

John Pirie Bridge, locally known as &quot;the bridge to nowhere&quot;, was built in the 1970s to encourage development of industry on the other side of Port Pirie Creek. Construction cost $410,000 and lasted 26 weeks. It was officially named the John Pirie Bridge in 1980. The land across the bridge remains undeveloped.

==Economy==
The main industries are the smelting of metals, and the operation of silos to hold grain.

, Port Pirie is the locality of the largest lead smelter and refinery in the southern hemisphere; a lead smelter has been there since the 1880s. The owner since 2007, Nyrstar, is the city&#x27;s main employer., and high blood lead levels in the local population are an ongoing concern. In 2006 Zinifex formed a joint venture with Umicore to create Nyrstar, which owns the smelter, with the intention that it would eventually be an entity separate from the parent companies.
===Waterfront development===
The PPRC completed a major redevelopment of its foreshore area in 2014 including the construction of the Solomontown Beach Plaza, opening up Beach abroad to through traffic, replacing lighting along the beach and improving security.

==Efforts to combat lead poisoning==

Lead smelters contribute to several environmental problems, especially raised lead levels in the blood of some of the town population. The problem is particularly significant in many children who have grown up in the area. A state government project addressed this. Nyrstar plans to progressively reduce lead in blood levels such that ultimately 95% of all children meet the national goal of 10 micrograms per decilitre. This has been known as the &quot;tenby10&quot; project. Community lead in blood levels in children are now at less than half the level that they were in the mid 1980s.

The Port Pirie smelter conducted a project to reduce lead levels in children to less than 10 micrograms per decilitre by the end of 2010.
&quot;The goal we are committed to achieving is for at least 95% of our children aged 0 to 4 to have a blood lead level below ten micrograms per decilitre of blood (the first ten in tenby10) by the end of 2010&quot; (the second ten in tenby10).
Higher concentrations of lead have been found in the organs of bottlenose dolphins stranded near the lead smelter, compared to dolphins stranded elsewhere in South Australia. The health impacts of these metals on dolphins has been examined and some associations between high metal concentrations and kidney toxicity were noted.

==Education ==
Port Pirie has many educational institutions, including John Pirie Secondary School (years 7–12), St Mark&#x27;s College (Foundation - year 12), Mid North Christian College (reception - year 12), many preschools and primary schools, and a TAFE campus (adult education).

Risdon Park High School (formerly Port Pirie Technical High School) was a co-ed state school. In 1973, Port Pire Technical High School changed its name to Ridson Park High School, and in 1995 the school merged with Port Pirie High School forming John Pirie Secondary School.

==Culture==

Port Pirie is home to the National Trust Historic and Folk Museum and Memorial Park, and the Port Pirie Regional Art Gallery also serves the regional community. 

Every September and October the city hosts a country music festival.

The Keith Michell Theatre, within the Northern Festival Centre, is named after the renowned actor Keith Michell, who grew up in Warnertown, from Port Pirie.

A play by actress and playwright Elena Carapetis, &quot;The Gods of Strangers&quot;, set in Port Pirie, is based on the oral histories of Greek, Cypriot and Italian people who migrated to regional South Australia after World War II. It was staged by the State Theatre Company South Australia in 2018. It played at the Dunstan Playhouse in Adelaide as well as in Port Pirie. It was also filmed by local production company KOJO and intended to be shown by Country Arts SA in regional cinemas in 2020, but it was later shown online owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia.

==News media==
The town&#x27;s main newspaper, &quot;The Recorder,&quot; was first published 21 March 1885 as &quot;The Port Pirie Advocate and Areas News&quot;. In 1971, a brief experiment, known as the &quot;Northern Observer&quot; (7 July - 30 August 1971), occurred when &quot;The Recorder&quot; and &quot;The Transcontinental&quot; from Port Augusta were published under a combined title in Port Pirie. &quot;The Recorder&quot;, which is still in print today (Tuesdays and Thursdays), has recently changed to a morning paper, after being delivered at around 3:00 pm. Other Port Pirie newspapers include the free &quot;The Flinders News&quot; (Wednesdays), and &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, which covers some Port Pirie news, but to a very small extent.

Another newspaper, the &quot;Port Pirie Advertiser&quot; (7 April 1898 – 28 June 1924) was also published by Robert Osborne. A further publication was the short-lived &quot;Saturday Times&quot; (6 December 1913 – 15 August 1914), printed by Roy Harold Butler and closed at the start of the Great War.

Television coverage in the city is provided by the ABC, SBS, Southern Cross (7, 9 and 10) and Austar. Several radio stations cover Port Pirie, including ABC 639AM, ABC 891AM, 1044 5CS, 1242 5AU, ABC Classic FM, Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, triple j, Magic FM and Trax FM (a community radio station).

==Governance==
===State and federal===

The results shown are from &quot;Port Pirie West&quot;, the largest polling booth in Port Pirie, which is at the SA TAFE Campus.

Port Pirie is part of the federal division of Grey, and has been represented by Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey since 2007. Grey is held with a margin of 4.43% but is considered a safe Liberal seat.

The city is part of the state electoral district of Frome, which had been held since 1993 by former Liberal Premier, Rob Kerin, with a margin of 3.4%. It also has been considered a safe Liberal seat.

Although the region is generally Liberal-leaning because of its agricultural base, Port Pirie is an industrial centre that is favourable to the Australian Labor Party.

In late 2008, Rob Kerin announced his retirement, which led to a by-election being held in January 2009. Port Pirie mayor Geoff Brock announced his candidacy as an independent, and subsequently took the seat from the Liberals at the 2009 Frome by-election. After the poll for the by-election had closed and first preferences had been counted, (but before other preferences had been distributed), the result was LNP: 39.2%; ALP: 26.1%; Brock 23.6%; Nat: 6.6%; Greens: 3.8%; Other: 0.7%.

State Opposition Leader Martin Hamilton-Smith (Liberal Party) claimed victory, prematurely. Distribution of National Party, Greens and other preferences placed Brock ahead of the ALP candidate. Hence with the assistance of the ALP candidate&#x27;s preferences, Geoff Brock won the by-election 51.7% to 48.3% for the Liberal candidate.

===Local government===
Port Pirie and some of the sparsely inhabited areas around it are in the Port Pirie Regional Council local government area.

<text>Thomas Ethelbert Skilling III (born February 20, 1952) is a former American television meteorologist. From 1978 to his retirement in 2024, he worked as a meteorologist at WGN-TV in Chicago.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
The oldest of four children, Tom Skilling was born at Magee Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Thomas Jr. and Betty (Clarke) Skilling. His early years were spent in Westfield, New Jersey. The family moved to the Chicago suburb of Aurora, Illinois, where he attended West Aurora High School. While in high school Tom began his career in broadcasting at age 14, working for WKKD and WKKD-FM. Skilling observed that WKKD&#x27;s forecasts were inaccurate because they were for Chicago and not Aurora, so he approached WKKD and offered to forecast the weather for several days, with the condition that if his forecasts were accurate he would be hired to host his own weather program. Skilling&#x27;s forecasts were accurate, and he was hired to forecast Aurora&#x27;s weather three times a day. At age 18, he began working at WLXT-TV in Aurora.

Skilling attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison to study meteorology and journalism. While attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he worked at WKOW-TV and WTSO radio, both in Madison. In 1975 Skilling took his first major-market television position, becoming the lead forecaster at WITI-TV in Milwaukee. At WITI, he delivered his forecasts with the &quot;help&quot; of the station&#x27;s resident sock puppet mascot, Albert the Alley Cat.

===WGN-TV===
Skilling returned to the Chicago area and joined WGN-TV on August 13, 1978. He was WGN-TV&#x27;s chief meteorologist and was rumored to be the highest-paid local broadcast meteorologist in the United States. He also had written the daily weather column for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. That feature, Ask Tom, ceased in August 2022 with a redesign of the weather page.

His weather broadcasts have always featured the latest technology in computer imagery and animation techniques. He has long been hailed for his in-depth reports and striking accuracy, perhaps best highlighted by his correctly predicting the Groundhog Day blizzard in 2011 almost two weeks before it paralyzed the Chicago area. &quot;Skillful&quot;, as his late WGN-TV colleague Bob Collins called him, was consulted for the movie &quot;The Weather Man&quot;, which was set in Skilling&#x27;s hometown of Chicago at a fictionalized version of WGN-TV.

He also narrated the documentaries &quot;It Sounded Like a Freight Train&quot; and &quot;When Lightning Strikes&quot; for the station, about the science and dangers of tornadoes (the documentary also includes the Chicago area&#x27;s history of tornadoes) and lightning.

Skilling announced on October 12, 2023 that he would be retiring from WGN-TV on February 28, 2024. On February 1, 2024, WGN announced that the WGN Weather Center will be renamed the Tom Skilling Weather Center.

===AMS and Fermilab===
Skilling is a member of the American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association. He hosted annual tornado and severe weather seminars at the Fermi National Accelerator Lab (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. 2013 marked the 32nd year of the seminar and the first that featured presentations specifically on climate change. In 2018, he announced he would stop hosting these seminars because of scheduling conflicts. 

==Awards and honors ==
In January 1995, Tom received an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois.

Asteroid 91888 Tomskilling, discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in 1999, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on October 8, 2014 (M.P.C. 90379). A statement honoring his career was read into the Congressional record on November 1, 2023.

On May 2, 2024, Skilling was announced as the Grand Marshall of the 2024 Woodstock (IL) Pridefest 

==Personal life==
Tom is the older brother of Jeffrey Skilling, the disgraced former chief executive officer of Enron Corporation.

<doc id="479192" wikidata="Q1033335" url="?curid=479192" title="Canisius University">
<text>Canisius University is a private Jesuit university in Buffalo, New York. It was founded in 1870 by Jesuits from Germany and is named after St. Peter Canisius. Canisius offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and minors, and around 34 master&#x27;s and certificate programs.

==History==
Canisius has its roots in the Jesuit community that arose from disputed ownership of St. Louis Church in Buffalo in 1851. Rev. Lucas Caveng, a German Jesuit, along with 19 families from St. Louis Church, founded St. Michael&#x27;s Church on Washington St. The college followed, primarily for serving sons of German immigrants, along with the high school in 1870, first at 434 Ellicott St. and next to St. Michael&#x27;s. In 1913 construction of the Old Main building at 2001 Main St. was completed. The early presidents of the college were German Jesuits. 

In 2010, John Hurley was named the first lay president of the college, serving in that role until his retirement in 2022.

In July 2020, President John Hurley and the board of trustees laid off 96 employees, including 25 faculty positions, most of them tenured. Several majors were eliminated, including Classics, Entrepreneurship, European studies, Fine Arts, Human Services, International Business, Physics, Religious Studies and Urban Studies. In response, the college&#x27;s faculty senate issued votes of no confidence in the president and board of trustees. 

In June 2021, the college was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors &quot;for infringement of governance standards&quot;.

Several affected tenured faculty members sued the college for violation of contract. The move attracted criticism from numerous academic organizations, including the American Historical Association and the Association for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies

Steve Stoute took office as the 25th president of Canisus on July 1, 2022.

On April 27, 2023, Canisius announced that it had successfully petitioned the New York State Education Department Board of Regents for university designation. It officially changed its name to Canisius University on August 1, 2023.

=== Title IX investigations ===
In 2015 Canisius College was one of more than 90 colleges investigated by the Department of Education&#x27;s Office of Civil Rights for its handling of sexual assault and harassment complaints. In 2021, three former female student athletes filed a federal lawsuit in the Western District of New York alleging a hostile environment and that the college &quot;failed to take appropriate action in response to these reports and complaints of sexual harassment, abuse and sexual assault&quot;. On June 27, 2022, a judge allowed the lawsuit launched by former Canisius athletes’ to proceed, describing the college’s delayed response to sexual assault allegations as “inexplicable.” 

In a separate federal lawsuit filed in 2022, five former female students alleged that Canisius College ignored sexual misconduct complaints against Professor Michael Noonan and allowed him to retire in 2019 rather than pursuing Title IX complaints against him.

== Campus ==

=== Christ the King Chapel ===
Christ the King Chapel, designed by Buffalo architect Duane Lyman, is centrally located to &quot;symbolize its importance&quot;. It was completed in 1951 and has seating for 492.

=== Science Hall ===
Science Hall was built as a Sears and Roebuck store in 1929. The college has allocated $68 million for its renovation, over $35 million of which has been raised with help from the John R. Oishei Foundation.

=== Science Hall Parking Ramp ===
The parking ramp originally served the Sears and Roebuck building at 1901 Main St. However, throughout the history of ramp, Canisius students have used it for parking, with Sears advertising in &quot;The Griffin&quot; student newspaper that parking was free. Acquisition of the property has eliminated parking problems. The ramp was demolished in 2022. A new green space surface lot is planned to replace it.

=== Churchill Academic Tower ===
The 11-story Churchill Academic Tower was built in 1971, designed by Leroy H. Welch. It is named for its chief benefactor, Rev. Clinton H. Churchill and his wife Francis. The Tower is routinely derided but serves as a highly functional space.

===Andrew L. Bouwhuis Library===
Built in 1957 and upgraded in 1988 and from 2013 through 2015, Andrew L. Bouwhuis Library, named for Andrew L. Bouwhuis, S.J., college librarian from 1935 to 1955, furnishes extensive area for study and research. It seats 500 people. 

=== The Koessler Athletic Center ===
Located at 1833 Main Street in Buffalo, the Koessler Athletic Center is named after J. Walter Koessler, class of 1922. The facility has a swimming pool, two weight rooms, two gymnasiums and locker rooms and offices for athletic coaches and support staff.

== Academics ==
Canisius offers more than 100 majors, minors and special programs. The college is accredited by the Middle States Association Commission on Higher Education, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Through the George E. Schreiner &#x27;43, MD, Pre-Medical Center, the college caters to the biological and health science fields and holds close relationships with both the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine.

=== Rankings ===
Canisius earned the 21st spot in the top tier of U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2022 rankings of America&#x27;s Best Regional Universities – North. U.S. News also ranked Canisius thirteenth in the 2016 &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; listing among regional universities in the North. Canisius earned the eighth spot among 49 regional universities in the North in U.S. News&#x27; Best Colleges for Veterans Ranking, as well as #4 in Best Value Schools and #26 in Top Performers on Social Mobility, for 2022. Canisius College alumni ranked first (1st), overall, in New York State on the 2014 CPA exam cycle, with a 75 percent pass rate, in the category of medium programs.

==Student life==
Canisius has on campus about 90 clubs and organizations, vetted by the Undergraduate Student Association and its senators. Program offerings include the Best of Buffalo series, Fusion game nights, the Fall Semi-Formal, the Canisius Royals competition, the Mass of the Holy Spirit with Fall BBQ and Bonfire, Griffin Week, and Griff Fest. With a growing student population in its colleges, Buffalo has begun offering free Canal-side concerts, along with &quot;Shakespeare in the Park&quot;, the Polish Broadway Market, Silo City &quot;Boom Days&quot; on Buffalo&#x27;s industrial history, and Dyngus Day.

===Athletics===
The college sponsors 20 NCAA Division I athletic teams and is a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) as well as the Atlantic Hockey Conference. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, ice hockey, and golf. Women&#x27;s sports include volleyball and softball. The Golden Griffins compete in the NCAA Division I and are members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) for most sports, except for men&#x27;s ice hockey which competes in the Atlantic Hockey America. In 2013, the men&#x27;s ice hockey team won its first Atlantic Hockey Championship, earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament. In 2008, Canisius men&#x27;s lacrosse won the MAAC tournament and earned its first bid to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship tournament.

The Women&#x27;s Lacrosse team won MAAC Championships four years in a row (2010-2014). The 2008 Baseball team won its first regular season MAAC championship, with a 41–13 season, and the following year made its first appearance in the MAAC Championship game. In 2013, the team won the MAAC Championship and received its first bid to the NCAA tournament. The Canisius College softball team won the 2009 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament for its 3rd consecutive title, marking the team&#x27;s 11th trip to the NCAA tournament in 15 years. In its rivalry with Niagara University Canisius won the Canal Cup two of the first three years (2008 and 2009). Intramural sports are also offered for students, faculty, and staff.

Canisius&#x27; mascot is the Golden Griffin. The college adopted the Griffin as a mascot in 1932, after Charles A. Brady (&#x27;33) wrote a story in a Canisius publication honoring Buffalo&#x27;s centennial year as a city. Brady wrote about Jesuit-educated explorer Rene-Robert LaSalle&#x27;s &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, which was built in Buffalo. The Griffin was first used on the La Salle medal in 1932 and from there spread to the college newspaper, &quot;The Griffin&quot;, and sports teams. According to GoGriffs.com, the griffin is a &quot;legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagle&#x27;s talons as its front feet.&quot; It represents values such as courage, boldness, intelligence, and strength befitting students and athletes alike.

The college was also the first home field of the Buffalo All-Americans of the early National Football League. Around 1917 Buffalo manager Barney Lepper signed a lease for the team to play their home games at Canisius College. The All-Americans played games at Canisius before relocating to Bison Stadium in 1924.

===Greek life===
The three college-approved Greek organizations on campus are the Lambda chapter of the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp), the sorority Phi Sigma Sigma, and the professional organization Alpha Kappa Psi (AK Psi). Also there is a Classics Club which fosters the Jesuit value of a Classical education, as well as &quot;cura personalis&quot;.

===Media===
The student weekly newspaper is &quot;The Griffin&quot;, which replaced &quot;The Canisian&quot; in 1933 and continues to print weekly. The annual &quot;Quadrangle&quot; magazine contains student writings, artwork, and photographs. Public-access television cable TV broadcasts to Canisius College from its fourth floor studio at Lyons Hall. The WIRE, replacing WCCG, is the college&#x27;s radio station, which broadcasts over the campus television system and is online through the college website.

=== ROTC ===
Canisius is the Reserve Officer Training Corps hub for Western New York. The Golden Griffin Battalion is composed of students from Canisius, University at Buffalo, Hilbert College, D&#x27;Youville University, Daemen University, Buffalo State University, and Erie Community College.

<text>Count Carl Emil Ulrich von Donop (January 1, 1732 – October 25, 1777) was a Hessian colonel who fought in the American Revolutionary War. He died of wounds during the Battle of Red Bank.

==Biography==

===Origins and ambitions===
The son of a noble family of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Donop was well connected in the European courts and served as personal adjutant to the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He served with distinction in the Seven Years&#x27; War. When the American Revolutionary War began, Donop asked for leave to fight against the revolutionaries. The Landgrave appointed him to command four battalions of grenadiers and the prestigious Jäger Corps. A highly ambitious officer, Donop hoped to remain in North America after the war, to pursue dreams of power and glory.

Wearing a veneer of civility, and deferential to his superiors, Donop was an able officer but was not well liked by his subordinates. To his inferiors he was short-tempered and harsh, and he had a take-no-prisoners policy that was enforced by severe beatings.

===Early battles===
Donop&#x27;s troops took part in the initial British landing on Long Island, New York, on August 22, 1776, and in the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27. They also participated in the landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay on Manhattan Island on the night of September 14. Donop distinguished himself at the Battle of Harlem Heights, going to the aid of the British troops involved.

===Retreat after Battle of Trenton===
Donop was the senior officer present in southern New Jersey in late 1776, and commanded the garrisons in Trenton, Burlington, and Bordentown, which consisted of several Hessian battalions, the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot (commanded by Colonel Stirling), and Jäger detachments. His main camp was at Bordentown prior to the Battle of Trenton, with one battalion occupying the town and the rest billeted along the country roads in Slabtown [Jacksonville] Black Horse [Columbus] Burlington City and White Hill (the Mary Field Plantation). His overall commander was Major General James Grant. Donop wanted to absorb Colonel Johann Rall&#x27;s brigade into his garrison to fortify Trenton, but William Howe was persuaded to let Rall hold command on his own in Trenton. Warned by local Loyalists of impending attack, Donop warned Grant, who dismissed these cautions.

On December 22, 1776, Colonial militia under the command of Colonel Samuel Griffin attacked Donop&#x27;s southern outposts at Slabtown. This force of colonials was sent from Philadelphia by General Israel Putnam as a deterrent to further encroachment on the river crossings opposite the colonial capitol at Philadelphia. The colonials numbered about 900 local militia and a few regulars, while Donop commanded over two thousand veterans.

In response to this attack, Donop moved his entire force south, pushing the colonials through Mount Holly at the Battle of Iron Works Hill and onto the opposite side of the Rancocas Creek. On Christmas Eve, the colonials retreated a few miles to Moorestown.
Donop&#x27;s officers wanted him to return to Bordentown, within easy supporting distance for Rall. Donop had nothing but contempt for Rall and decided to spend Christmas in the company of &quot;a beautiful young widow&quot; - as reported by his Captain of Jägers, Johann Ewald. There is some speculation, but no proof, that the &quot;beautiful young widow&quot; was Betsy Ross.
A rider brought news of the disaster at Trenton about mid-day on December 26. Out of position, and fearing he would be cut off from the remaining Royal Forces, Donop ordered his corps to move through Crosswicks to Princeton. He left a rear guard and allowed for baggage wagons, wounded and such to be brought along. He abandoned a good bit of plunder in his excitement and urgency.
The victory at Trenton was won by Washington, but some credit should be given to the young widow who held Donop out of position a day too long to be of help to Rall.

===Battle of Red Bank===
When Howe&#x27;s forces captured Philadelphia in 1777, he then acted to open the Delaware River to the British navy. The effort was directed at the forts on either side of the river. The Royal Navy on the Delaware River, under the command of Admiral Francis Reynolds, attacked Fort Mifflin in Pennsylvania. In an attempt to recoup his tarnished reputation from his defeat at Trenton, Donop volunteered to attempt the capture of Fort Mercer at Red Bank in what is now National Park, New Jersey. General Howe agreed, if it could be done easily, and gave Donop command of 2,000 Hessian mercenary troops, with which he crossed the Delaware River on October 22. That afternoon, Donop surrounded the fort and demanded surrender from Colonel Christopher Greene with the threat of invasion and no quarter. Greene, in a strong position with 400 Rhode Islanders and in possession of plentiful cannon, grapeshot, and powder, rejected the demand. Donop led 1,200 Hessians in three attacks on the fort, all of which were beaten back, resulting in nearly 400 Hessian casualties, including Donop himself. Fatally wounded in what would be known as the Battle of Red Bank, Donop died two days later on October 25, 1777. He said to a brother officer before he died: “It is finishing a noble career early; but I die the victim of my ambition, and of the avarice of my sovereign.”

He was buried on Red Bank Battlefield.

<doc id="479209" wikidata="Q548599" url="?curid=479209" title="Exploitation of natural resources">
<text>The exploitation of natural resources describes using natural resources, often non-renewable or limited, for economic growth or development. Environmental degradation, human insecurity, and social conflict frequently accompany natural resource exploitation. The impacts of the depletion of natural resources include the decline of economic growth in local areas; however, the abundance of natural resources does not always correlate with a country&#x27;s material prosperity. Many resource-rich countries, especially in the Global South, face distributional conflicts, where local bureaucracies mismanage or disagree on how resources should be used. Foreign industries also contribute to resource exploitation, where raw materials are outsourced from developing countries, with the local communities receiving little profit from the exchange. This is often accompanied by negative effects of economic growth around the affected areas such as inequality and pollution

The exploitation of natural resources started to emerge on an industrial scale in the 19th century as the extraction and processing of raw materials (such as in mining, steam power, and machinery) expanded much further than it had in pre-industrial areas. During the 20th century, energy consumption rapidly increased. Today, about 80% of the world&#x27;s energy consumption is sustained by the extraction of fossil fuels, which consists of oil, coal and natural gas.

Another non-renewable resource humans exploit is subsoil minerals, such as precious metals, mainly used to produce industrial commodities. Intensive agriculture is an example of a mode of production that hinders many aspects of the natural environment, for example the degradation of forests in a terrestrial ecosystem and water pollution in an aquatic ecosystem. As the world population rises and economic growth occurs, the depletion of natural resources influenced by the unsustainable extraction of raw materials becomes an increasing concern. The continuous alteration of the environment through water, mineral, and forest exploitation poses increased risks of climate-based displacement and conflict stemming from scarcity, which threaten to perpetuate social inequities.
==Causes==
*Advancing technology: Increasing technology sophistication enables faster rates of natural resource extraction. For example, in the past, it could take a long time to log a small amount of trees using only saws. Due to better technology, the rates of deforestation have greatly increased.
*Overconsumption has created a high demand for natural resources, further exacerbating natural resource exploitation 
*Development of new technologies, such as electric vehicles and portable technologies, i.e, Smartphones, also heavily rely on cobalt mining, often leading to loss of green cover and detrimental health impacts for surrounding communities, often in developing countries like the D.R. of Congo where mining occurs.
*Consumerism: Unsustainable consumption, driven by both population growth and materialistic ideologies, increases the demand for production and, thereby, the extraction of the natural resources needed to supply this demand. For instance, the consumption of fine jewelry leads to increased mining of gold and diamonds. The extraction of precious metals like gold has degradation effects on the environment, such as loss of forestry during construction of the mining facilities, increased exposure to toxic materials, and disturbance of the nearby ecosystem.
*Management thinking: In relation to the previous point, companies have adopted the idea according to which the rarer the resource, the more it contributes to the company&#x27;s competitive advantage. When it comes to natural resources, such an idea leads to natural resource exhaustion.
*A general lack of respect for native land rights leads to increased exploitation of natural resources on and around native land.

==Consequences of exploitation of resources==
Natural resources are not limitless, and the following consequences can arise from the careless and excessive consumption of these resources:
*Deforestation: Removal of trees for use as resources, such as in agriculture or industry, can lead to large-scale destruction of forests. Around 40% of the Earth&#x27;s original forest cover has been lost in the last 8000 years.
*Desertification: Human-led changes in land management practices lead to changes in the ecological characteristics of a region. Land mismanagement and climate change can lead to a loss of ecosystem services, such as through degradation of soil. Together, these losses can result in desertification seen in arid and dry areas.
*Decrease in natural resources: When resources are exploited faster than they can be replenished, it results in an overall decrease in natural resources in an area.
*Extinction of species: Processes involved in resource exploitation can directly or indirectly lead to the extinction of species. Animals used for resources can be directly hunted, while destruction of environments, such as through harvesting timber, can also cause extinctions.
*Forced migration
*Soil erosion
*Oil depletion
*Ozone depletion
*Greenhouse gas increase
*Water gasification
*Natural hazard/Natural disaster
*Metals and minerals depletion.
*Indigenous groups have limited ways to relate to the environment and survive on traditional food and water sources 

== Economic consequences ==
Natural resources are vital for human survival, however, if their consumption surpasses their natural replenishment rate, the resources can become depleted. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, around 33% of the Earth&#x27;s soils are presently classified as moderately to highly degraded, with projections indicating that more than 90% could face degradation by the year 2050 and thus cause significant economic consequences. With such rate of erosion of fertile soil, agricultural commodity prices tend to increase significantly. The connection between the consumption rate and the supply rate of resources holds significant implications for long-term economic growth, as sustained high consumption rates of certain resources ultimately jeopardize economic sustainability. For instance, in the case of extracting soil minerals, supply rate is exceedingly slow over geological time spans, inevitably leading to a consumption rate surpassing the supply rate. Such a scenario is evidently unsustainable in the long run. To ensure sustainability, the consumption rate must remain equal to or less than the supply rate.

There has been an ongoing debate among scholars and researchers on the economic implications of dependence on natural resources. Natural resources yield economic rents that can be allocated towards public welfare initiatives and other projects beneficial to local communities. However, in the long term, uncertainties linked to potentially unstable terms of trade for commodities might lead to decline in public finances and deter investment. For instance, if oil prices decline, it may lead to fiscal unease in significant petroleum-producing countries such as Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Resource abundance challenges the progress of political and governance institutions by nurturing a culture of rentierism. For instance, revenues obtained from resources can be used for political manipulation. Additionally, extra capital from resources can dilute government accountability to both citizens and businesses by abandoning taxation completely, which leads to lack of government incentive to support economic growth through innovation. At the same time, citizens may lack the motives to advocate for better governance and transparency.

Because of environmental pollution, cities whose economies rely on natural resources face difficulties in attracting technology-driven businesses and skilled labor, posing significant challenges to their economic transformation and advancement. These resource-centric cities face disadvantages in the competition among local governments striving for environmental quality. Analyzing panel data spanning from 2005 to 2017 for 30 coal-mining cities, it&#x27;s been discovered that environmental regulations offer a new approach to potentially reversing the adverse effects of resource dependence, and thus fueling greener sustainable development in coal-mining regions.

Despite the inevitability of environmental contamination associated with resource extraction because of current mining technologies, this pollution delays residents&#x27; engagement in agricultural and aqua cultural activities, which are negatively influenced by environmental conditions. As a result, these cities tend to rely heavily on a singular economic development model centered around resource exploitation, making them ill-equipped to address environmental crises effectively. Economic gains from natural resources are mostly beneficial when directed towards initiatives such as job creation, skill enhancement, capacity building, and pursuit of long-term developmental objectives. Thus, reliance on one or more natural resources holds financial risk when aiming for a stable economic growth.

== Impacts of settler colonialism ==
Multiple scholars have explained how Settler colonialism has had profound influence on the dynamics of resource exploitation throughout history, especially in regions where settler populations have previously asserted dominance over indigenous peoples and their territories. Among these scholars Dina Gilio-Whitaker, an expert in Native American Studies from California State University explains that, “Indigenous peoples fighting for political autonomy from the hegemony of the State are fighting the forces of colonialism while simultaneously fighting capitalism—all aimed at control of land and resources&quot; This encompasses the establishment of permanent settler communities, typically accompanied by the displacement, marginalization, or even extermination of indigenous populations. Settler Colonial exploration is most often driven by the pursuit of land and resources which has historically created the exploitation of natural wealth to fuel economic growth, infrastructure development, and territorial expansion.

One of the key way which settler colonialism drives resource exploitation is through the appropriation of indigenous lands and natural resources. Kyle Powys Whyte, an expert in natural resources and the environment highlights how the continued legacy of settler colonialism continues to harm indigenous communities. In his piece “The Dakota Access Pipeline, Environmental Injustice, and US Settler Colonialism” he writes, “as climate change becomes more apparent in its homelands, the shifting plant and animal habitats tied to agriculture, wildlife, and ceremonial species, as well as the loss of territory and resources as a result of US settler colonialism, will make it harder to adjust.”

Settler societies often view the land as a commodity to be exploited for economic gain, leading to the establishment of extractive industries such as mining, logging, and agriculture on indigenous territories. This exploitation is facilitated by legal frameworks that prioritize settler property rights over indigenous land tenure systems, resulting in the dispossession and displacement of indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Moreover, settler colonialism often entails the imposition of Western concepts of land ownership and resource management that marginalize indigenous knowledge and practices, further exacerbating environmental degradation and social injustice.
== Impacts of industrialization and globalization ==
Industrialization, the large scale growth of industry, has had profound impacts on natural resource exploitation. As societies undergo industrialization, there is an increased demand for raw materials to fuel manufacturing, construction, and energy production. As outlined by Farhan Ahmed, professor of economics and finance, industrialization can bring a myriad of challenges for natural resources. In his piece “The environmental impact of industrialization and foreign direct investment: empirical evidence from Asia-Pacific region” Ahmed writes “In addition to the many benefits of foreign direct investment and industrialization that have affected economic growth, both have significant potential for environmental degradation because most of their activities are related to the production and exploitation of natural resources.&quot; This demand often leads to intensified extraction activities, such as mining, logging, and drilling, which can result in extensive habitat destruction, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. Additionally, industrial processes often generate pollution and waste, further exacerbating environmental impacts and threatening ecosystems and biodiversity. industrialization has been associated with the commodification of natural resources, where resources are valued primarily for their economic potential rather than their intrinsic ecological or cultural value. This commodification mindset often leads to unsustainable exploitation practices, as resources are overexploited for short-term economic gain without consideration for long-term environmental sustainability.

Globalization has significantly impacted resource exploitation by reshaping patterns of production, consumption, and trade on a global scale. The interconnectedness of economies and the proliferation of multinational corporations have led to increased competition for access to natural resources, such as minerals, fossil fuels, timber, and agricultural products, in diverse regions around the world. This heightened demand for resources has driven intensified extraction activities, often in environmentally sensitive areas, and has contributed to the overexploitation and depletion of finite resources. Haiying Liu, professor of economics, explains how globalization results in more environmental stress in her piece “Impact of governance and globalization on natural resources volatility”. In this piece she writes, “In addition to natural resources exported from the region, the technical capability required to explore natural resources is also dependent on economic globalization. Environmental pressure increases as a result of globalization.” Globalization has spurred the development of complex supply chains and trade networks that connect resource-rich regions with centers of production and consumption across the globe. While this interconnectedness has fueled economic growth and development in some regions, it has also led to the commodification and commercialization of natural resources, where resources are valued primarily for their economic potential rather than their intrinsic ecological or cultural value. Globalization has contributed to the unequal distribution of benefits and burdens associated with resource exploitation, with marginalized communities often bearing the environmental and social costs of resource extraction while multinational corporations and rich nations reap the profits

==Effects on local communities==

===Papua New Guinea===
When a mining company enters a developing country in the global south to extract raw materials, advocating the advantages of the industry&#x27;s presence and minimizing the potential negative effects gain the cooperation of the local people. Advantageous factors are primarily in economic development establishments, such as health centers, police departments, and schools, that the government may not provide. However, these advantages are not always distributed evenly among local populations, and the income generated from extracting natural resources can result in internal conflict within the developing country. In addition to unequal distribution, the adaption of consumerist values also results in conflict over resources within local communities.

Despite being rich in natural resources, the Democratic Republic of Congo is one country in the global south suffering from the effects of the resource curse. Its valuable copper and cobalt mineral deposits make Congo vulnerable to local and international conflict over the distribution of resources. These conflicts, along with the environmental degradation effects of mining, exacerbate high poverty rates, which approximately 64% of the Congolese population live under. Natural resource extraction and climate change are intertwined in Congo, as mining for copper and cobalt creates a biodiversity loss as green covers are cleared for constructing artisanal mines and roadways. Conflict over resources, poverty, and environmental degradation leaves a large number of the Congolese population vulnerable to internal displacement, lacking resources to adapt to climate change. Beyond climate impacts, mineral mining has also been linked with adverse health impacts, such as high levels of cobalt in urine and blood samples in populations located on or near industrial mines. Mining ores pose health risks long after mining has ceased, as wastelands generate toxic metal-rich dust. The injustice perpetrated by unsafe mining ores is not exclusive to the adult and child laborers. Instead, it impacts the whole country as low wages for high-risk mining worsen poverty rates, exacerbating negative social impacts such as conflict, higher crime rates, and child mortality.

The effects of the exploitation of natural resources in the local community of a developing country are also exhibited in the impacts from the Ok Tedi Mine. After BHP entered into Papua New Guinea to exploit copper and gold, the economy of the indigenous peoples boomed. Although their quality of life has improved, initially disputes were common among the locals in terms of land rights and who should be getting the benefits from the mining project. The consequences of the Ok Tedi environmental disaster illustrate the potential negative effects from the exploitation of natural resources. The resulting mining pollution includes toxic contamination of the natural water supply for communities along the Ok Tedi River, causing widespread killing of aquatic life. When a mining company ends a project after extracting the raw materials from an area of a developing country, the local people are left to manage with the environmental damage done to their community and the long run sustainability of the economic benefits stimulated by the mining company&#x27;s presence becomes a concern.

== Responses and solutions ==
Responses and solutions to natural resource exploitation have emerged across the globe as communities and stakeholders grapple with the environmental, social, and economic impacts of unsustainable practices. These movements often employ a variety of tactics, including protests, legal challenges, boycotts, and direct actions, to challenge destructive practices and promote alternatives that prioritize environmental sustainability, social justice, and community well-being. Additionally, there has been growing recognition of the importance of indigenous knowledge, traditional ecological practices, and community-based approaches in addressing the root causes of resource exploitation and advancing sustainable development goals.

=== Resistance to mining in Peru ===
Resistance to natural resource exploitation in the developing countries is often intertwined with broader social and economic struggles. Many communities facing exploitation are marginalized and economically disadvantaged which exacerbates the unequal power dynamics at play. Resistance movements often demand not only environmental justice but also fair compensation, employment opportunities, and community development initiatives. Solidarity networks, both within countries and internationally, have been crucial in amplifying the voices of affected communities and exerting pressure on governments and corporations to adopt more sustainable and equitable practices. Despite facing significant challenges, these movements continue to inspire hope for a more just and sustainable future in the Global South and beyond.

Anti-mining protests in Peru have emerged as a significant expression of resistance against large-scale mining projects that pose environmental and social threats to local communities. One notable instance is the resistance against the Conga mining project in the Cajamarca region. José Manuyama Ahuit, a native Peruvian activist working against local mining, was quoted saying, “The river forms part of our spirit and culture. If the river dies, so does our human dignity, now this river is doomed. The colour of the water is changing, and the same devastation in other mining areas is beginning to be reproduced here in the Nanay. Local communities, including farmers and indigenous groups, have vehemently opposed the project due to concerns of water contamination and depletion. The proposed mining operation, led by multinational corporations, has been met with widespread demonstrations, blockades, and legal challenges. These protests underscore broader issues of environmental protection and indigenous rights, as communities seek to safeguard their lands and livelihoods from the detrimental impacts of resource extraction.

In response to the anti-mining protests, Peruvian authorities have often deployed security forces to quell dissent, leading to clashes and instances of violence. These clashes have resulted in injuries and fatalities on both sides, escalating tensions between mining companies, local communities, and the government. Efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict have been disrupted by deep-seated mistrust and differing interests among the stakeholders involved.

== Resistance in Native American communities ==
Resistance to natural resource exploitation in native communities has been a recurring theme throughout history, as indigenous people  have sought to protect their lands, cultures, and ways of life from the adverse impacts of extractive industries. In many cases, indigenous resistance movements have emerged as powerful forces advocating for environmental justice, indigenous rights, and sovereignty over ancestral territories. These movements often mobilize around issues such as land rights, resource extraction, and environmental protection, employing a variety of tactics, including protests, legal challenges, direct actions, and advocacy campaigns to assert indigenous control over natural resources and resist exploitative practices.

The Dakota Access Pipeline resistance, also known as the Standing Rock movement, emerged as a significant indigenous-led protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States. The pipeline, proposed by Energy Transfer Partners, was intended to transport crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, traversing ancestral lands and sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, as well as posing potential threats to water sources, including the Missouri River, which serves as a vital water supply for the tribe and millions of others downstream. The resistance movement, which began in 2016, brought together indigenous activists, environmentalists, and allies from across the country and around the world in a unified effort to oppose the pipeline&#x27;s construction. Nick Estes, a scholar of American Indian studies who has followed the Dakota Access Pipeline protests closely, points out that the tactics being used in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been used for generations. In his piece  “Our History is The Future”  he writes, “Our history and long traditions of Indigenous resistance provide possibilities for futures premised on justice. After all, Indigenous resistance is animated by our ancestors&#x27; refusal to be forgotten, and it is our resolute refusal to forget our ancestors and our history that animates our visions for liberation.

The Dakota Access Pipeline resistance garnered widespread attention and support, drawing thousands of people to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and protect their lands and water. Among the supporters was activist and performing artists Dallas Goldtooth of the Dakota tribe. Goldtooth highlighted the importance of social media in modern protests saying, “social media allowed immediate direct one-on-one access and kind of this perception of unfiltered access – unfiltered access to what was happening on the ground&quot;

The movement was characterized by nonviolent protests, prayer ceremonies, and acts of civil disobedience, as well as legal challenges aimed at halting the pipeline&#x27;s construction and holding the government and energy companies accountable for violating indigenous rights and environmental regulations. The resistance movement also sparked a broader conversation about indigenous sovereignty, environmental justice, and the impacts of fossil fuel infrastructure on indigenous communities and the environment.

<text>The secret ballot, also known as the Australian ballot, is a voting method in which a voter&#x27;s identity in an election or a referendum is anonymous. This forestalls attempts to influence the voter by intimidation, blackmailing, and potential vote buying. This system is one means of achieving the goal of political privacy.

Secret ballots are used in conjunction with various voting systems. The most basic form of a secret ballot utilizes paper ballots upon which each voter marks their choices. Without revealing the votes, the voter folds the ballot paper in half and places it in a sealed box. This box is later emptied for counting. An aspect of secret voting is the provision of a voting booth to enable the voter to write on the ballot paper without others being able to see what is being written. Today, printed ballot papers are usually provided, with the names of the candidates or questions and respective check boxes. Provisions are made at the polling place for the voters to record their preferences in secret, and the ballots are designed to eliminate bias and prevent anyone from linking voters to the ballot.

A privacy problem arises with moves to improve the efficiency of voting by the introduction of postal voting and remote electronic voting. Some countries permit proxy voting, but some argue this is inconsistent with voting privacy. The popularity of the ballot selfie has challenged the secrecy of in-person voting.

In systems of direct democracy, such as the Swiss &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;, voting is typically conducted publicly to ensure all citizens can observe the outcome.

==Secret vs. public methods==

The secret ballot became commonplace for &quot;individual citizens&quot; in democracies worldwide by the late 20th century.

Votes taken by &quot;elected officials&quot; are typically public, so citizens can judge officials&#x27; and former officials&#x27; voting records in future elections. This may be done with a physical or electronic in-person system or through a roll call vote. Some faster legislative voting methods do not record who voted in which way, though witnesses in the legislative chambers may still notice a given legislator&#x27;s vote. These include voice votes where the volume of shouting for or against is taken as a measure of numerical support and counting of raised hands. In some cases, a secret ballot is used to allow representatives to choose party leadership without fear of retaliation against those voting for losing candidates. The parliamentary tactics of forcing or avoiding a roll call vote can be used to discourage or encourage representatives to vote in a manner that is politically unpopular among constituents (for example, if a policy considered to be in the public interest is difficult to explain or unpopular but without a better alternative, or to hide pandering to a special interest) or to create or prevent fodder for political campaigns.

Public methods of citizen voting have included:
* Oral proclamation, where votes are shouted out one at a time, usually at an assembly
* Going to a particular area at an assembly, such as a town meeting or the Iowa caucus. This is the origin of the term &quot;&quot; for an election, originally meaning &quot;top of the head&quot;, which is what was being counted at these assemblies.
* Small balls or other objects, such as corn, pebbles, beans, bullets, colored marbles, or cards. This is the origin of the term &quot;&quot;, originally meaning &quot;small ball&quot;.
* Raising of hands at an assembly
* Cutting a brightly colored ballot (with the color corresponding to the party of choice) out of a newspaper and bringing it to a polling place
* An open ballot system

Private methods of citizen voting have included:
* Writing the name of the preferred candidate or outcome on a piece of paper and putting it in a container (which excludes illiterate voters)
* Marking a government-printed ballot (which may exclude illiterate voters if they only include words and cannot get assistance, but some ballots include colors, symbols, or pictures to avoid this)

==History==

===Ancient===
In ancient Greece, secret ballots were used in several situations like ostracism and also to remain hidden from people seeking favors. In early 5th century BC the secrecy of ballot at ecclesia was not the primary concern, but more of a consequence of using ballots to count the votes accurately. Secret ballot was introduced into public life of Athens during second half of the fifth century.

In ancient Rome, the &quot;Tabellariae Leges (&quot;English: &quot;Ballot Laws)&quot; were four laws that implemented secret ballots for votes cast regarding each of the major elected assemblies of the Roman Republic. Three of the four laws were put in place in relatively quick succession, with one each in the years 139 BC, 137 BC, and 131 BC, applying respectively to the elections of magistrates, jury deliberations excepting charges of treason as well as the passage of laws. The final of the four laws was implemented more than two decades later in 107 BC and served solely to expand the law passed in 137 BC to require secret ballots for all jury deliberations, including treason.

Before these ballot laws, one was required to verbally provide their vote to an individual responsible for tallying the votes, effectively publicly making every voter&#x27;s vote known. Mandating secret ballots had the effect of reducing the influence of the Roman aristocracy, who were capable of influencing elections through a combination of bribes and threats. Secret balloting helps assuage both of those concerns, as not only are one&#x27;s peers unable to determine which way you voted, there is additionally no proof that could be produced that you &quot;did&quot; vote certain way, perhaps contravening directions .

===France===
Article 31 of the Constitution of the Year III of the Revolution (1795) states that &quot;All elections are to be held by secret ballot&quot;. The same goes with the constitution of 1848: voters could hand-write the name of their preferred candidate on their ballot at home (the only condition was to write on white paper) or receive one distributed on the street. The ballot was folded in order to prevent other people from reading its contents.

Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte attempted to abolish the secret ballot for the 1851 plebiscite with an electoral decree requesting electors to write down &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; (in French: &quot;oui&quot; or &quot;non&quot;) under the eyes of everyone. But he faced strong opposition and eventually relented, allowing the secret ballot to occur.

According to the official website of the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot; (the lower house of the French parliament), the voting booth was permanently adopted only in 1913.

===United Kingdom===

The demand for a secret ballot was one of the six points of Chartism. The British parliament of the time refused even to consider the Chartist demands. Still, Lord Macaulay, in an 1842 speech, while rejecting Chartism&#x27;s six points as a whole, admitted that the secret ballot was one of the two points he could support.

The London School Board election of 1870 was Britain&#x27;s first large-scale election by secret ballot.

After several failed attempts (several of them spearheaded by George Grote), the secret ballot was eventually extended generally in the Ballot Act 1872, substantially reducing the cost of campaigning (as treating was no longer realistically possible) and was first used on 15 August 1872 to re-elect Hugh Childers as MP for Pontefract in a ministerial by-election following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The original ballot box, sealed in wax with a licorice stamp, is held at Pontefract museum.

However, the UK uses numbered ballots to allow courts to intervene, under rare circumstances, to identify which candidate voters voted for.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In Australia, secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in Tasmania on 7 February 1856.

Until the original Tasmanian &quot;Electoral Act 1856&quot; was &quot;re-discovered&quot; recently, credit for the first implementation of the secret ballot often went to Victoria, where the former mayor of Melbourne William Nicholson pioneered it, and simultaneously South Australia. Victoria enacted legislation for secret ballots on 19 March 1856, and South Australian Electoral Commissioner William Boothby generally gets credit for creating the system finally enacted into law in South Australia on 2 April of that same year (a fortnight later). The other British colonies in Australia followed: New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1859), and Western Australia (1877).

State electoral laws, including the secret ballot, applied for the first election of the Australian parliament in 1901, and the system has continued to be a feature of federal elections and referendums.
The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not explicitly set out the secret ballot, but a reading of sections 206, 207, 325, and 327 of the Act would imply its assumption. Sections 323 and 226(4), however, apply the principle of a secret ballot to polling staff and would also support the assumption.

New Zealand implemented secret voting in 1870.

===United States===

Before the final years of the 19th century, partisan newspapers printed filled-out ballots, which party workers distributed on election day so voters could drop them directly into the boxes. Individual states moved to secret ballots soon after the presidential election of 1884, finishing with Kentucky in 1891 when it quit using an oral ballot.

Initially, however, a state&#x27;s new ballot did not necessarily have all four components of an &quot;Australian ballot&quot;:
# an official ballot being printed at public expense,
# on which the names of the nominated candidates of all parties and all proposals appear,
# being distributed only at the polling place and
# being marked in secret.

After ballots are cast and no longer identifiable to the voter, several states make the ballots and copies of them available to the public so the public can check counts and do other research with the anonymous ballots.

Louisville, Kentucky, was the first city in the United States to adopt the Australian ballot. It was drafted by Lewis Naphtali Dembitz, the uncle of and inspiration for future Supreme Court associate justice Louis Brandeis. Massachusetts adopted the first state-wide Australian ballot, written by reformer Richard Henry Dana III, in 1888. Consequently, it is also known as the &quot;Massachusetts ballot&quot;. Seven states did not have government-printed ballots until the 20th century. Georgia started using them in 1922. When South Carolina followed suit in 1950, this completed the nationwide switch to Australian ballots. The 20th century also brought the first criminal prohibitions against buying votes in 1925.

While U.S. elections are now held primarily by secret ballot, there are a few exceptions:
* North Carolina has a confidential but not secret ballot for early in-person voting (one-stop) and absentee-by-mail voting. General Statute § 163-227.5 states that the &quot;ballot shall have a ballot number on it in accordance with G.S. 163-230.1(a2), or shall have an equivalent identifier to allow for retrievability.&quot; If a voter casts an absentee ballot or votes at a one-stop site (early voting) or absentee-by-mail, but it is discovered that the voter was ineligible (ex., died between casting ballot and election day), the ballot would be retrieved using a unique number written at the top of the ballot. Each county Election Director maintains a database with the names of each voter and associated retrievable ballot numbers.
* Mail-in ballots do not meet the definition of Australian ballots, as they are distributed to voters&#x27; homes, and there is no guarantee that they are marked secretly. They may be used as absentee ballots, and Colorado, Oregon, and Washington conduct all elections by mail.
* In some U.S. states, a political party nominating caucus requires an open ballot system. This includes, most notably, the leadoff Presidential nominating state of Iowa.
* The Constitution of West Virginia specifies that voters may choose to cast an open ballot, though they must also have the option to cast a secret ballot.

==International law==
The right to hold elections by secret ballot is included in numerous treaties and international agreements that obligate their signatory states:
* Article 21.3 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; states, &quot;The will of the people...shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which...shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.&quot;
* Article 23 of the &quot;American Convention on Human Rights (the Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica)&quot; grants to every citizen of member states of the Organization of American States the right and opportunity &quot;to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters&quot;.
* Paragraph 7.4 of the &quot;Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE&quot; obligates the member states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to &quot;ensure that votes are cast by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedure, and that they are counted and reported honestly with the official results made public.&quot;
* Article 5 of the &quot;Convention on the Standards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States&quot; obligates electoral bodies not to perform &quot;any action violating the principle of voter&#x27;s secret will expression.&quot;
* Article 29 of the &quot;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&quot; requires that all Contracting States protect &quot;the right of persons with disabilities to vote by secret ballot in elections and public referendums&quot;

==Disabled people==

Ballot design and polling place architecture often deny the disabled the possibility to cast a vote secretly. In many democracies disabled persons may vote by appointing another person who is allowed to join them in the voting booth and fill the ballot in their name. This does not assure secrecy of the ballot.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which entered into force in 2008, ensures a secret ballot for disabled voters. Article 29 of the Convention requires that all Contracting States protect &quot;the right of the person with disabilities to vote by secret ballot in elections and public referendums&quot;. According to this provision, each Contracting State should provide voting equipment enabling disabled voters to vote independently and secretly. Some democracies, e.g. the United States, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Albania or India allow disabled voters to use electronic voting machines. In others, among them Azerbaijan, Canada, Ghana, the United Kingdom, and most African and Asian countries, visually impaired voters can use ballots in Braille or paper ballot templates. Article 29 also requires that Contracting States ensure &quot;that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use.&quot; In some democracies, e.g., the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States, all the polling places already are fully accessible for disabled voters.

==Secrecy exceptions==

The United Kingdom secret ballot arrangements are sometimes criticized because linking a ballot paper to the voter who cast it is possible. Each ballot paper is individually numbered, and each elector has a number. When an elector is given a ballot paper, their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the ballot paper (which also carries the ballot paper number). This means, of course, that the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed if anyone can gain access to the counterfoils, which are locked away securely before the ballot boxes are opened at the count. Polling station officials colluding with election scrutineers may, therefore, determine how individual electors have voted.

This measure is thought to be justified as a security arrangement so that false ballot papers could be identified if there was an allegation of fraud. The process of matching ballot papers to voters is formally permissible only if an Election Court requires it; the Election Court has rarely made such an order since the secret ballot was introduced in 1872. One example was in a close local election contest in Richmond-upon-Thames in the late 1970s with three disputed ballots and a declared majority of two votes. Reportedly, prisoners in a UK prison were observed identifying voters&#x27; ballot votes on a list in 2008. The legal authority for this system is set out in the Parliamentary Elections Rules in Schedule 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.

Most states guarantee a secret ballot in the United States. But some states, including Indiana and North Carolina, require the ability to link some ballots to voters. This may, for example, be used with absentee voting to retain the ability to cancel a vote if the voter dies before election day. Sometimes the number on the ballot is printed on a perforated stub which is torn off and placed on a ring (like a shower curtain ring) before the ballot is cast into the ballot box. The stubs prove that an elector has voted and ensure they can only vote once, but the ballots are both secret and anonymous. At the end of voting day, the number of ballots inside the box should match the number of stubs on the ring, certifying that a registered elector cast every ballot and that none of them were lost or fabricated. Sometimes, the ballots themselves are numbered, making the vote trackable. In 2012 in Colorado, this procedure was ruled legal by Federal District Judge Christine Arguello, who determined that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a right to a secret ballot.
