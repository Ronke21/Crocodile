<text>The term &quot;51st state&quot; in American political discourse refers to the idea of adding a new state to the Union, either by granting statehood to one of the U.S. territories, splitting an existing state, admitting another country, or granting statehood to Washington, D.C. This would increase the number of states in the United States from 50 to 51. The last state to be admitted was Hawaii in August 1959, preceded by Alaska, which became a state just months earlier in January 1959, and Arizona in February 1912.

Currently, there are two active statehood movements: one for D.C. and another for Puerto Rico. Four other U.S. territoriesGuam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islandshave chosen to remain territories, and while statehood is a possibility, there are no active movements for it in those territories.

The latter part of this term also refers to its use as a phrase, rather than an actual political process.

Voters in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have both voted for statehood in referendums. Their admission to the Union as states would require congressional approval. American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States Virgin Islands are other U.S. territories that could potentially become U.S. states. However, D.C. and Puerto Rico are the only ones with particularly active statehood movements. Guam voted in the 1980s against being a state, and the Northern Marianas joined the USA in 1986 as a Commonwealth; likewise, American Samoa has no statehood movement.

There are several different ways a 51st State could be created. These include granting a U.S. territory statehood (as happened with Alaska and many other states); a state could be split (Kentucky was created this way); or another republic could be annexed (as was Vermont for example). Finally, the Federal District may be able to be made into a State, though the legality of this is debated.

The phrase can be used in a positive sense, meaning that a region or territory is so aligned, supportive, and conducive with the United States that it is like a U.S. state, or in a pejorative sense, meaning an area or region is under excessive American cultural or military influence or control. People who believe their local or national culture has become too Americanized sometimes use the term in reference to their own countries. Before Alaska and Hawaii became states of the United States in 1959, the equivalent expression was &quot;the 49th state&quot;.
==Legal requirements==
Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution authorizes Congress to admit new states into the United States (beyond the thirteen already in existence at the time the Constitution went into effect in 1788). Historically, most new states brought into being by Congress have been established from an organized incorporated territory, created and governed by Congress. In some cases, an entire territory became a state; in others, some part of a territory became a state. As defined in a 1953 U.S. Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the traditionally accepted requirements for statehood are:
* The inhabitants of the proposed new state are imbued with and are sympathetic toward the principles of democracy as exemplified in the American Constitution.
* A majority of the electorate wish for statehood.
* The proposed new state has sufficient population and resources to support state government and carry its share of the cost of Federal Government.

Although not a legal rule, historically having at least 60,000 free adult males was also a requirement for statehood. This was outlined in the Northwest Ordinance decreed in 1787 when the United States was under the Articles of Confederation. Even though the USA no longer operates under this government, Congress has generally followed this guideline as states were added to the union.

In most cases, the organized government of a territory made known the sentiment of its population in favor of statehood, usually by referendum. Congress then directed that government to organize a constitutional convention to write a state constitution. Upon acceptance of that constitution by the people of the territory and then by Congress, a joint resolution would be adopted granting statehood. The President would then issue a proclamation adding a new state to the Union. While Congress, which has ultimate authority over the admission of new states, has usually followed this procedure, there have been occasions (because of unique, case-specific circumstances) when it did not.

A simple majority in each House of Congress is required to pass statehood legislation; however, in the United States Senate, the filibuster requires 60 votes to invoke cloture. Some statehood advocacy organizations have called for amending or abolishing the filibuster as a path to achieve statehood. As with other legislation, the President can sign or veto statehood bills that pass, and Congress has the power to override a veto with a two-thirds majority; Nebraska is the only existing state admitted through a veto override.

Although Congress, with approval of the President, can add a state to the Union, they cannot make another State by splitting or merging two existing states, without the consent of the State (or States) legislatures involved.
While States can join the United States, once they do so it is illegal to leave.

Once it becomes a State there are rules, it must for example write a State constitution and it must have sufficient financial and human resources to run its State government and support the Federal government.

== U.S. flag ==
If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design of the flag to accommodate an additional star for the 51st state. However, according to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, an existing United States flag never becomes obsolete. In the event that a new state is added to the Union and a 51-star flag is approved, any previously approved American flag (such as the 50-star flag) may continue to be used and displayed until no longer serviceable.

On June 13, 2022, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered flags with 51 stars to be hung along Pennsylvania Avenue in support of D.C. being added as a 51st state. Similar displays have been designed and used as symbols by supporters of statehood in various areas.
== U.S. Senate classes ==
Should a 51st state be admitted, it would receive U.S. Senate seats in classes 1 and 2, at which point all three classes would have 34 senators.

==From existing territories of the United States==

===District of Columbia===

The District of Columbia is often mentioned as a candidate for statehood. In Federalist No. 43 of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, James Madison considered the implications of the definition of the &quot;seat of government&quot; found in the United States Constitution. Although he noted potential conflicts of interest, and the need for a &quot;municipal legislature for local purposes&quot;, Madison did not address the district&#x27;s role in national voting. Legal scholars disagree on whether a simple act of Congress can admit the District as a state, due to its status as the seat of government of the United States, which Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution requires to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress; depending on the interpretation of this text, admission of the full District as a state may require a Constitutional amendment, which is much more difficult to enact. 
The District of Columbia residents who support the statehood movement sometimes use the slogan &quot;Taxation without representation&quot; to denote their lack of Congressional representation. The phrase is a shortened version of the Revolutionary War protest motto &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; omitting the initial &quot;No&quot;, and is printed on newly issued District of Columbia license plates (although a driver may choose to have the District of Columbia website address instead). President Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential limousine had the &quot;Taxation without representation&quot; license plate late in his term, while President George W. Bush had the vehicle&#x27;s plates changed shortly after beginning his term in office. President Barack Obama had the license plates changed back to the protest style shortly before his second-term inauguration. President Donald Trump eventually removed the license plate and signaled opposition to D.C. statehood.

This position was carried by the D.C. Statehood Party, a political party; it has since merged with the local Green Party affiliate to form the D.C. Statehood Green Party. The nearest this movement ever came to success was in 1978, when Congress passed the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment. Two years later in 1980, local citizens passed an initiative written and filed by J. Edward Guinan calling for a constitutional convention for a new state. In 1982, voters ratified the constitution of the state, which was to be called New Columbia. The drive for statehood stalled in 1985, however, when the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment failed because not enough states ratified the amendment within the allowed seven-year span.

Another proposed option would be to have Maryland, from which the D.C. land was ceded, retake the District of Columbia, as Virginia has already done for its part, while leaving the National Mall, the United States Capitol, the United States Supreme Court, and the White House in a truncated District of Columbia. This would give residents of the District of Columbia the benefit of statehood while precluding the creation of a 51st state, but would require the consent of the Government of Maryland.

====2016 statehood referendum====
On April 15, 2016, District Mayor Muriel Bowser called for a citywide vote on whether the nation&#x27;s capital should become the 51st state. This was followed by the release of a proposed State Constitution. This Constitution would make the Mayor of the District of Columbia the Governor of the proposed state, while the members of the District Council would make up the proposed House of Delegates.

On November 8, 2016, the voters of the District of Columbia voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood, with 86% of voters voting to advise approving the proposal.

While the name &quot;New Columbia&quot; has long been associated with the movement, the City Council and community members chose the proposed state name to be the State of Columbia, or the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. The Maryland abolitionist Frederick Douglass was a D.C. resident and was chosen to be the proposed state&#x27;s namesake alongside George Washington of Virginia.

====Federal enclave====

To fulfill Constitutional requirements of having a Federal District and to provide the benefits of statehood to the 700,000-plus residents of D.C., in the proposed State of Washington, D.C., boundaries would be delineated between the State of Washington, D.C., and a much smaller federal seat of government. This would ensure federal control of federal buildings. The National Mall, the White House, the national memorials, Cabinet buildings, judicial buildings, legislative buildings, and other government-related buildings, etc. would be housed within the much smaller federal seat of government. All residences in the State of Washington, D.C. would reside outside the seat of federal government, except for the White House. The proposed boundaries are based on precedents created through the 1902 McMillan Plan with a few modifications. The rest of the boundaries would remain the same.

====Admission legislation====
On June 26, 2020, the United States House of Representatives voted 232–180 in favor of statehood for Washington, D.C.

Passage of this legislation in the Senate was unlikely while the Republican Party held a Senate majority, and President Donald Trump also promised to veto D.C. statehood. The legislation was H.R. 51 in honor of D.C. potentially becoming the 51st state. However, since the 2020 Senate elections, the Democratic Party has had a Senate majority, meaning Joe Biden&#x27;s presidency might have opened the door for D.C. statehood.

The vote was the first time D.C. ever had a vote for statehood pass any chamber of Congress: in 1993, D.C. statehood legislation was rejected in a US House floor vote by 153–277. Another problem is that because Maryland released the land to become D.C., it may have a claim on any land released by Congress to become a state.

On April 22, 2021, the United States House of Representatives voted 216–208 in favor of statehood for Washington, D.C. A similar bill, S. 51, &quot;A bill to provide for the admission of the State of Washington, D.C. into the Union&quot; was earlier introduced into the United States Senate. On April 30, Democratic senator Joe Manchin came out against both bills, effectively dooming their passage. (See 117th United States Congress) Senator Manchin said the way to make D.C. a State was by a constitutional amendment, which was the process for the voting rights with the 23 Amendment. He went further stated that the complications created by shrinking the Federal District to the National Mall with the 23rd Amendment should be addressed. While others disagreed, he thought that if had been approved it would end up in the Supreme Court.

=== Puerto Rico ===

Puerto Rico has been discussed as a potential 51st state of the United States. In 2019, H.R. 1965 – Puerto Rico Admission Act, 5% of the lower legislature were in support. The bill was passed on to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

In a 2012 status referendum a majority of voters, 54%, expressed dissatisfaction with the existing political relationship. In a separate question, 61% of voters supported statehood (excluding the 26% of voters who left this question blank). On December 11, 2012, Puerto Rico&#x27;s legislature resolved to request that the President and the U.S. Congress act on the results, end its territorial status and begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico to the Union as a state. On January 4, 2017, Puerto Rico&#x27;s new representative to Congress pushed a bill that would ratify statehood by 2025.

On June 11, 2017, another non-binding referendum was held where 97.7 percent voted for the statehood option. The turnout for this vote was 23 percent, a historical low as voter turnout in Puerto Rico usually hovers around 80%. The low turnout was attributed to a boycott led by the pro-status quo PPD party.

On June 27, 2018, the Puerto Rico Admission Act of 2018 H.R. 6246 was introduced in the U.S. House with the purpose of responding to, and complying with, the democratic will of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico as expressed in the plebiscites held on November 6, 2012, and June 11, 2017, by setting forth the terms for the admission of the territory of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union. The admission act had 37 original cosponsors among Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.

A subsequent nonbinding referendum was held on November 3, 2020, to decide whether Puerto Rico should become a state. Statehood won the vote 52.52%–47.48%.

On December 15, 2022, H.R. 8393 (the Puerto Rico Status Act) passed the House of Representatives in a 233-191 vote with 11 absences. It would have instituted a binding referendum that would allow Puerto Ricans to vote on the future status of the island, that Congress would be required to obey. Every Democrat voted in favor of the bill, and was joined by 16 Republicans. The bill died in the Senate.
The 2024 Puerto Rican status referendum was also a win for Statehood in the November 2024 election, which also saw a Pro-Statehood Governor of Puerto Rico elected.

On February 15, 2025, the Puerto Rico House of Representatives approved a resolution on the legal status of Puerto Rico, &#x27;the resolution, requests that &quot;the President and Congress of the United States of America respond promptly and act in accordance with the demands of the citizens of Puerto Rico.

====Background====

Since 1898, Puerto Rico has had limited representation in the United States Congress in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a non-voting delegate. The 110th Congress returned the Commissioner&#x27;s power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but not on matters where the vote would represent a decisive participation. Puerto Rico has elections on the United States presidential primary or caucus of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party to select delegates to the respective parties&#x27; national conventions although presidential electors are not granted on the Electoral College. As American citizens, Puerto Ricans can vote in U.S. presidential elections, provided they reside in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and not in Puerto Rico itself.

Residents of Puerto Rico pay U.S. federal taxes: import and export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, thereby contributing to the American Government. Most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax but do pay federal payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). However, federal employees who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico–based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and others do pay federal income taxes. Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U.S. military. Puerto Ricans have participated in all American wars since 1898; 52 Puerto Ricans had been killed in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan by November 2012.

Puerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century after it was ceded to the U.S. by Spain following the end of the Spanish–American War, and Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917. The island&#x27;s ultimate status has not been determined, and its residents do not have voting representation in their federal government. Like the states, Puerto Rico has self-rule, a republican form of government organized pursuant to a constitution adopted by its people, and a bill of rights.

This constitution was created when the U.S. Congress directed local government to organize a constitutional convention to write the Puerto Rico Constitution in 1951. The acceptance of that constitution by Puerto Rico&#x27;s electorate, the U.S. Congress, and the U.S. president occurred in 1952. In addition, the rights, privileges and immunities attendant to United States citizens are &quot;respected in Puerto Rico to the same extent as though Puerto Rico were a State of the Union&quot; through the express extension of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the U.S. Constitution by the U.S. Congress in 1948.

Puerto Rico is designated in its constitution as the &quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot;. The Constitution of Puerto Rico, which became effective in 1952, adopted the name of &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Free Associated State&quot;), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic. The island is under the jurisdiction of the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which has led to doubts about the finality of the Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico. In addition, all people born in Puerto Rico become citizens of the U.S. at birth (under provisions of the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917), but citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for the President of the United States nor for full members of either house of Congress. Statehood would grant island residents full voting rights at the federal level and 2 state senators, like each US state has.

In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a Memorandum to heads of Executive Departments and Agencies establishing the administrative relationship between the Federal Government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all Federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a State insofar as doing so would not disrupt Federal programs or operations. President Bush&#x27;s memorandum remains in effect until Federal legislation is enacted to alter the status of Puerto Rico in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of Puerto Rico.

On April 29, 2010, the United States House of Representatives approved the Puerto Rico Democracy Act (H.R. 2499) by 223–169, but was not approved by the Senate before the end of the 111th Congress. It would have provided for a federally sanctioned self-determination process for the people of Puerto Rico. This act would provide for referendums to be held in Puerto Rico to determine the island&#x27;s ultimate political status. It had previously been introduced in 2007.

====Vote for statehood====
In November 2012, a referendum resulted in 54 percent of respondents voting to reject its status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution, while a second question resulted in 61 percent of voters identifying statehood as the preferred alternative to its territorial status. The 2012 referendum was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates and support for statehood rose in each successive popular referendum. However, more than one in four voters abstained from answering the question on the preferred alternative status. Statehood opponents have argued that the statehood option garnered 45 percent of the votes if abstentions are included. If abstentions are considered, the result of the referendum is much closer to 44 percent for statehood, a number that falls under the 50 percent majority mark.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; have published opinion pieces expressing support for the statehood of Puerto Rico. On November 8, 2012, Washington, D.C. newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot; published an article saying that Congress will likely ignore the results of the referendum due to the circumstances behind the votes. U.S. Congressman Luis Gutiérrez and U.S. Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez, both of Puerto Rican ancestry, agreed with &quot;The Hill&quot;″s statements. Shortly after the results were published, Puerto Rico-born U.S. Congressman José Enrique Serrano commented &quot;I was particularly impressed with the outcome of the &#x27;status&#x27; referendum in Puerto Rico. A majority of those voting signaled the desire to change the current territorial status. In a second question an even larger majority asked to become a state. This is an earthquake in Puerto Rican politics. It will demand the attention of Congress, and a definitive answer to the Puerto Rican request for change. This is a history-making moment where voters asked to move forward.&quot;

Several days after the referendum, the Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, Governor Luis Fortuño, and Governor-elect Alejandro García Padilla wrote separate letters to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, addressing the results of the voting. Pierluisi urged Obama to begin legislation in favor of the statehood of Puerto Rico, in light of its win in the referendum. Fortuño urged him to move the process forward. García Padilla asked him to reject the results because of their ambiguity. The White House position on the November 2012 plebiscite was that the results were clear, the people of Puerto Rico want the issue of status resolved, and a majority chose statehood in the second question. Former White House director of Hispanic media stated, &quot;Now it is time for Congress to act and the administration will work with them on that effort, so that the people of Puerto Rico can determine their own future.&quot;

On May 15, 2013, Resident Commissioner Pierluisi introduced H.R. 2000 to Congress to &quot;set forth the process for Puerto Rico to be admitted as a state of the Union&quot;, asking for Congress to vote on ratifying Puerto Rico as the 51st state. On February 12, 2014, Senator Martin Heinrich introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate. The bill would require a binding referendum to be held in Puerto Rico asking whether the territory wants to be admitted as a state. In the event of a yes vote, the president would be asked to submit legislation to Congress to admit Puerto Rico as a state.

====Government funding for a fifth referendum====
On January 15, 2014, the United States House of Representatives approved $2.5 million in funding to hold a referendum. This referendum can be held at any time as there is no deadline by which the funds have to be used. The United States Senate then passed the bill which was signed into law on January 17, 2014, by Barack Obama, then President of the United States.

====2017 referendum====
The previous plebiscites had provided voters with three options: statehood, free association, and independence. The Puerto Rican status referendum of 2017 instead originally offered two options: Statehood and Independence/Free Association. However, a third option, &quot;current territorial status&quot; was later added. The referendum was held on June 11, 2017, with an overwhelming majority of voters supporting statehood at 97.16%; however, with a voter turnout of 22.99%, it was a historical low. Had the majority voted for Independence/Free Association, a second vote would have been held to decide whether to have full independence as a nation, or to achieve associated free state status with independence but with a &quot;free and voluntary political association&quot; between Puerto Rico and the United States. The specifics of the association agreement would&#x27;ve been to be detailed in the Compact of Free Association that would have had to be negotiated between the U.S. and Puerto Rico. That document could have covered topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico, the use of the U.S. currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens.

The governor, Ricardo Rosselló was strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to &quot;solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It&#x27;s a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy&quot;. Benefits of statehood would include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and the right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy.

At approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico&#x27;s legislators were expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the United States Congress. Regardless of the outcome of the referendum or the bill on drafting a constitution, action by Congress would have still been necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.

If the majority of Puerto Ricans were to choose the Free Association optionand 33% voted for it in 2012and if it were granted by the U.S. Congress, Puerto Rico would become a Free Associated State, a virtually independent nation. It would have a political and economical treaty of association with the U.S. that would stipulate all delegated agreements. This could give Puerto Rico a similar status to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, countries which have a Compact of Free Association with the United States.

Those Free Associated States use the American dollar, receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country. Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military.

In total, 500,000 Puerto Ricans voted for statehood, 7,600 voted for independence, and 6,700 voted for status quo.

====2020 referendum====
A referendum of the status of Puerto Rico was held on November 3, 2020, concurrently with the general election. This was the sixth referendum held on the status of Puerto Rico, with the previous one having taken place in 2017. This was the first referendum with a simple question, with voters having the option of voting for or against becoming a U.S. state.

The referendum was non-binding, as the power to grant statehood lies with the US Congress. The party platforms of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have affirmed for decades Puerto Rico&#x27;s right to self-determination and to be admitted as a state, at least in theory, but individual Republican legislators have been more skeptical.

According to Senate Bill 1467, which placed the referendum on the ballot, voting &quot;No&quot; on the referendum would mean that a seven-member commission would be appointed to negotiate with the federal government for the free association or independence of Puerto Rico.

Statehood won the referendum 52.52%–47.48%.
====2024 referendum====

In 2024 another referendum was conducted, with three choices: Statehood, Independence, or Independence with Free Association. Statehood won with 58% of the vote in this referendum, though it did not include an option for status quo.

=== Guam ===
Guam (formally the Territory of Guam) is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States. Located in the western Pacific Ocean, Guam is one of five American territories with a civilian government. Guam rejected unification with the Northern Mariana Islands in the past (see 1969 Guamanian unification with the Northern Mariana Islands referendum); at the same time, referendums held in the Northern Marianas in 1958, 1961, 1963, and 1969 consistently demonstrated that the Northern Mariana Islanders supported unification with Guam. The Northern Marianas in later referendums chose to join the United States, which it did in 1986 as the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant movement in favor of Guam becoming a commonwealth, which would give it a level of self-government similar to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. However, the federal government rejected the version of commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the Territorial Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) of the U.S. Constitution. Other movements advocate U.S. statehood for Guam, union with the state of Hawaii, union with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory, or independence.

In a 1982 plebiscite, voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status. The island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998. Governor Eddie Baza Calvo intended to include one during the island&#x27;s November 2016 elections but it was delayed again.

A Commission on Decolonization was established in 1997 to educate the people of Guam about the various political status options in its relationship with the U.S.: statehood, free association and independence. The group was dormant for some years. In 2013, the commission began seeking funding to start a public education campaign. There were few subsequent developments until late 2016. In early December 2016, the Commission scheduled a series of education sessions in various villages about the status of Guam&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. and the self-determination options that might be considered. The commission&#x27;s executive director is Edward Alvarez and there are ten members. The group is also expected to release position papers on independence and statehood but they have not yet been completed.

Guam was occupied for over 450 years by the Spanish and then the Japanese. Under the United States the people have had several referendums to determine their fate, and the current status dates to 1980s referendum which was won to continue as territory of the United States. Several late 20th referendums also determined they did not desire a unification with the Northern Marianas to the north, which joined the United States as territory in 1986.

In 2016, Governor Eddie Calvo planned a decolonization referendum solely for the indigenous Chamorro people of Guam, in which the three options would be statehood, independence, and free association. However, this referendum for the Chamorro people was struck down by a federal judge on the grounds of racial discrimination. In the wake of this ruling, Governor Calvo suggested that two ballots be held: one for the Chamorro People and one for eligible U.S. citizens who are non-indigenous residents of Guam. A reunification referendum in Guam and its neighbor, the Northern Mariana Islands (a U.S. Commonwealth) has been proposed. A 2016 poll conducted by the University of Guam showed a majority supporting statehood when respondents were asked which political status they supported.

====United Nations support====
The United Nations is in favor of greater self-determination for Guam, though it has concluded its interest in the Northern Marianas which was removed from list of non self governing after it chose to join in the United States after a series of referendums in the 1960s and 1970s. The UN&#x27;s Special Committee on Decolonization has agreed to endorse the governor&#x27;s education plan. The commission&#x27;s May 2016 report stated: &quot;With academics from the University of Guam, [the Commission] was working to create and approve educational materials. The Office of the Governor was collaborating closely with the Commission&quot; in developing educational materials for the public.

The United States Department of the Interior had approved a $300,000 grant for decolonization education, Edward Alvarez told the United Nations Pacific Regional Seminar in May 2016. &quot;We are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in [United States] policy to its Non-Self-Governing Territories such as Guam, where they will be more willing to engage in discussions about our future and offer true support to help push us towards true self-governances and self-determination.&quot;

===Other territories===

The Indian Territory attempted statehood in 1905, when citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes proposed creating the State of Sequoyah as a means to retain control of their lands and resources. A constitutional convention was held on August 21, 1905, in Muskogee, and the proposed constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the territory&#x27;s indigenous and white residents. Congress did not support statehood for Sequoyah, and the Indian Territory was annexed into Oklahoma in 1907.

The U.S. Virgin Islands explored the possibility of statehood in 1984, and in a 1993 referendum, while American Samoa explored the possibility of statehood in 2005 and 2017.
==By status changes of former U.S. territories==

===Philippines===

The United States annexed the Philippines as its territory from the Spanish Empire in 1898 and established the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands in 1901. Since then, the Philippines has had small grassroots movements for U.S. statehood. Originally part of the platform of the Progressive Party, then known as the Federalista Party, the party dropped it in 1907, which coincided with the name change.

During the Philippine presidential elections of 1981, 4% of the electorate voted for Bartolome Cabangbang, a member of the Interim Batasang Pambansa from Bohol. He ran under the Federal Party which advocated for a plebiscite to convert the Philippines into the 51st US state.

As recently as 2004, the concept of the Philippines becoming a U.S. state has been part of a political platform in the Philippines. Supporters of this movement include Filipinos who believe that the quality of life in the Philippines would be higher and that there would be less poverty there if the Philippines were an American state or territory. Supporters also include Filipinos that had fought as members of the United States Armed Forces in various wars during the Commonwealth period.
The Philippine statehood movement had a significant impact during its early period as an American territory. It is no longer a mainstream movement, but it is still a social movement that periodically gains interest and talk in the nation.

No major politician in the Philippines has advocated for US statehood . Election candidates in favor of the proposal have been declared as &quot;nuisance candidates&quot; by the Philippine government&#x27;s election commission.

==By partition of or secession from U.S. states==

There have historically been several proposals, with varying degrees of support, to divide states having regions that are politically or culturally divergent into smaller, more homogeneous, administratively efficient entities. Splitting a state requires the approval of both its legislature and the U.S. Congress.

Proposals of new states by partition include:

* Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah:
** Admitting into the Union the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian reservation in the United States. Reservations already enjoy a large degree of political autonomy, so making a state out of the Navajo Nation would not be as problematic as partitioning areas of other states. The Navajo Nation is larger than ten U.S. States. A Navajo state would help issues of representation, since as of 2023, four Representatives and one Senator were Native American. 
** The secession of Pima County in Arizona, with the hopes of neighboring counties Cochise, Yuma, and Santa Cruz joining to form a state.
* California and Oregon:
** The secession of Northern California and Southern Oregon to form a state named &quot;Jefferson&quot;. In 2021, 5 counties in Oregon voted to join Idaho.
** Various proposals of partition and secession in California, usually splitting the south half from the north or the urban coastline from the rest of the state. In 2014, businessman Tim Draper collected signatures for a petition to split California into six different states, but not enough to qualify for the ballot. Draper attempted a follow-up petition to split California into three states in 2018. However, the initiative to divide California into three states was ordered removed from the 2018 ballot by the California Supreme Court, as the California constitution does not allow this type of ballot initiative.
* Colorado: In 2013, commissioners in Weld County, Colorado, proposed to leave Colorado along with neighboring counties of Morgan, Logan, Sedgwick, Phillips, Washington, Yuma, and Kit Carson to form the state of &quot;North Colorado&quot;. The counties in contention voted to begin plans for secession that November, with mixed results.
* Delaware, Maryland and Virginia:
** The secession of several counties from the eastern shores of Maryland and Virginia, combining with some or all of the state of Delaware, forming a state named &quot;Delmarva&quot;.
** The secession of five counties on the western side of Maryland due to political differences with the more liberal central part of the state.
* Florida: The secession of South Florida and the Greater Miami area to form a state named &quot;South Florida&quot;. The region has a population of over 7 million, comprising 41% of Florida&#x27;s population.
* Illinois: 
** The secession of Cook County, which contains Chicago, to form a separate state, proposed by residents of the more conservative Downstate Illinois to free it from the political influence of the heavily liberal Chicago area. 
** The secession of Southern Illinois from the rest of the state, south of Springfield, with Mt. Vernon as the proposed capital.
** The secession of sixteen counties in Western Illinois to form the state of Forgottonia, with its capital in the small hamlet of Fandon.
* Michigan: The secession of the geographically separate and culturally distinct Upper Peninsula of Michigan from the Lower Peninsula, as a state called Superior.
* Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming: The secession of various rural parts of the aforementioned states to form a new state called Absaroka, its capital would have been Sheridan, Wyoming.
* New York: Various proposals partitioning New York into separate states, most of which involve to some degree the separation of New York City from the rest of the state. There have also been proposals to separate Long Island into a state.
* Texas: Under the resolution by which the Republic of Texas was admitted to the Union and the state constitution, it has the right to divide itself into up to five states. There were a significant number of Texans who supported dividing the state in its early decades, called divisionists. Texas politics and self-image suggest that disrupting Texas&#x27; status as the largest state by land area in the contiguous United States is unlikely.
* Washington: Dividing the state into Western Washington and Eastern Washington via the Cascade Mountains. Suggested names include East Washington, Lincoln, Cascadia, and more recently, Liberty. Territory for Lincoln would have also included part of Idaho.
* The National Movement for the Establishment of a 49th State, founded by Oscar Brown Sr. and Bradley Cyrus, and active in Chicago between 1934 and 1937, had the aim of forming an African-American state in the South.

==International use==
Some countries, because of their cultural similarities and close alliances with the United States, are sometimes described as a 51st state. In other countries around the world, movements with various degrees of support and seriousness have proposed U.S. statehood.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, &quot;the 51st state&quot; is a phrase generally used to imply that if a certain political course is taken, Canada&#x27;s destiny will be little more than a part of the United States. Examples include the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988, the debate over the creation of a common defense perimeter, and the potential consequence of not adopting proposals intended to resolve the issue of Quebec sovereignty, the Charlottetown Accord in 1992 and the Clarity Act in 1999.

The phrase is usually used in local political debates, in polemic writing or in private conversations. It is rarely used by politicians in public, although at certain times in Canadian history political parties have used other similarly loaded imagery. In the 1988 federal election, the Liberals asserted that the proposed Free Trade Agreement amounted to an American takeover of Canadathe party ran an ad in which Progressive Conservative (PC) strategists, upon the adoption of the agreement, slowly erased the Canada-U.S. border from a desktop map of North America. Within days, however, the PCs responded with an ad which featured the border being drawn back &quot;on&quot; with a permanent marker.

The implication has historical basis and dates to the breakup of British America during the American Revolution. The colonies that had confederated to form the United States, invaded Canada (then a term referring specifically to Upper Canada and Lower Canada, now the modern-day provinces of Quebec and Ontario, which had only been in British hands since 1763) several times, specifically the invasion of Quebec in 1775 and 1778–1782. The first invasion occurred in 1775–1776 mainly across the Canadian side of the Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence River valleys, under the assumption that French-speaking Canadians&#x27; presumed hostility towards British colonial rule combined with the Franco-American alliance would make them natural allies to the American cause; the Continental Army successfully recruited two Canadian regiments for the invasion. That invasion&#x27;s failure forced the members of those regiments into exile, and they settled mostly in upstate New York. However, the Continental Army was more successful in the Western theater in lands north of the Ohio Valley and south of the Great Lakes region, both of which were part of Canada. The Articles of Confederation, written during the Revolution, included a provision for Canada to join the United States, should they ever decide to do so, without needing to seek U.S. permission as other states would. At the end of the Revolution, the U.S. took portions of Canadian territory of what is now present day Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota in accordance to the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The U.S. again invaded Canada during the War of 1812, but this effort was made more difficult due to the wide use of ill-equipped state militias and owing to the large number of Loyalists that had fled to what is now Ontario and still resisted joining the republic. The Hunter Patriots in the 1830s and the Fenian raids after the American Civil War were private attacks on Canada from the U.S. Several U.S. politicians in the 19th century also spoke in favor of annexing Canada, as did Canadian politician William Lyon Mackenzie, who set up a rogue Republic of Canada on a small island near the U.S. border during the Upper Canada Rebellion.

In the United States, the term &quot;the 51st state&quot; when applied to Canada can serve to highlight the similarities and close relationship between the United States and Canada. Sometimes the term is used disparagingly, intended to deride Canada as an unimportant neighbor. 

==== Donald Trump&#x27;s proposals for Canadian annexation ====
In December 2024, then-President-elect Donald Trump suggested Canada consider becoming the 51st U.S. state if prime minister Justin Trudeau felt his planned tariffs would hurt Canada&#x27;s economy during a tense meeting with him over trade deficits and border security at Mar-a-Lago. He later referred to Trudeau as &quot;Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada&quot; and said that he looked forward to meeting him again to continue their talks on &quot;Tariffs and Trade&quot;. During an appearance on Fox News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford jokingly stated that this was Trump&#x27;s attempt at revenge for the War of 1812 by saying, &quot;I guess he&#x27;s still upset that in 1812 we burned down the White House and he&#x27;s holding a grudge after 212 years. He&#x27;s a funny guy&quot;. (Note: Canada was not a country at the time, it was British North America)

On December 3, in response to Trudeau suggesting that Canada would be too liberal, Trump suggested that Canada would enter the Union as two states, one more conservative, one more liberal. Under this initial proposal, Canada would not remain as its current configuration of ten provinces and three territories, but would instead occupy at least two new positions in the U.S. federal structure, becoming the 51st and 52nd states. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders quipped he would back Trump&#x27;s plan if they could expand Canada&#x27;s state-run health care system to all Americans.

Trump again referred to Trudeau as &quot;Governor&quot; in his Christmas post on his social media platform Truth Social, saying that if Canada became the 51st state, its taxes would be reduced by &quot;more than 60%&quot;, its businesses would &quot;immediately double in size&quot; and it would become exceptionally militarily protected. He later suggested that NHL legend Wayne Gretzky should run to become the Prime Minister of Canada.

Trump reacted to Trudeau&#x27;s resignation as prime minister by suggesting Canada join the United States, again posting on Truth Social:

Trump&#x27;s comments reignited pre-existing discourse on U.S.-Canadian union, with one discussion by Canadian author Don Tapscott outlaying several terms for the merger including that each province and territory would need to maintain its identity, so Canada would need to be composed of 13 states or territories. For example, Ontario would become the fifth largest state in the USA with 16 million residents. Next, Canadians must maintain their health care system. Canada spends 11 percent of its GDP on health care and yet they live six years longer with no one uninsured, in contrast in the USA, almost 20% is spent. There would be additional legal rights including women&#x27;s healthcare, paid parental leave for men and women, gun control, campaign finance, standardized education funding, and a more pro-refugee immigration stance, which are mostly regional rules that could be left to each state.

=== Opinion polling ===

==== Canadian polling ====
Since Donald Trump&#x27;s comments on his support of annexing Canada, there have been a number of opinion polls conducted asking Canadians on their opinion of the proposal. The responses from Canadians have been overwhelmingly against Canada joining the United States as the 51st state.
==== American polling ====
Some polls have also been conducted asking American opinions on Canada being annexed as the 51st state. An Angus Reid poll reported 49% of Americans opposing the proposal and 25% supporting it, with 26% being unsure.

==== Alberta ====


One example of a Canadian annexation movement is in the province of Alberta. In the 21st century, an Alberta51 separatist project was founded and gained some media attention. American geopolitics expert Peter Zeihan argued in his book &quot;The Accidental Superpower&quot; that the Canadian province of Alberta would benefit from joining the United States as the 51st state. There is growing support for Alberta separatism resulting from federal government policies which are believed to be harming the province&#x27;s ability to build pipelines for the province&#x27;s oil and gas industry and federal equalization payments. In a September 2018 poll, 25% of Albertans believed they would be better off separating from Canada and 62% believed they are not getting enough from confederation. Ever since Trump&#x27;s proposal on annexing Canada in 2024, interest within the Albertan annexationist movement has drawn increased attention within Alberta&#x27;s political landscape.

==== Western Canada ====
In 1980 two members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, both elected as members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan (and one, Dick Collver, its former leader), crossed the floor to form the Unionest Party, a provincial party in Saskatchewan which advocated that the four provinces of Western Canada should join the United States. The name was a contraction of &quot;best union.&quot; The party soon folded.

==== Newfoundland ====
In the late 1940s, during the last days of the Dominion of Newfoundland (at the time a separate dominion in the British Empire and independent of Canada), there was mainstream support, although not majority, for Newfoundland to form an economic union with the United States, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Union Party and significant U.S. investment in Newfoundland stemming from the U.S.-British alliance in World War II. The movement ultimately failed when, in a 1948 referendum, voters narrowly chose to confederate with Canada (the Economic Union Party supported an independent &quot;responsible government&quot; that they would then push toward their goals).

==== Quebec ====
In the 1989 Quebec general election, the political party Parti 51 ran 11 candidates on a platform of Quebec seceding from Canada to join the United States (with its leader, André Perron, claiming Quebec could not survive as an independent nation). The party attracted just 3,846 votes across the province, 0.11% of the total votes cast. In comparison, the principal party in favor of Quebec sovereignty in that election, the PQ, got 40.16%.

=== Rest of the Americas ===

====Mexico====
In 1847–1848, with the United States&#x27; resounding defeat of Mexico and the occupying at the conclusion of the Mexican–American War, there was talk in Congress of annexing the entirety of Mexico. The result was the Mexican Cession through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, named for the town in which the treaty was signed, in which the U.S. annexed almost 31% of Mexico. The Mexican Cession consisted of territory that became the states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, the western half of New Mexico, the western quarter of Colorado, and the southwest corner of Wyoming. The United States would later purchase additional Mexican territory in the Gadsden Purchase in 1854. In 1848, a bill was debated in Congress that would have annexed the Republic of Yucatán, but there was no vote.
====Central America====
Due to geographical proximity of the Central American countries to the U.S., with its powerful military, economic, and political influences, there were several movements and proposals by the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries to annex some or all of the Central American republics (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras with the formerly British-ruled Bay Islands, Nicaragua, Panama which had the U.S.-ruled Canal Zone territory from 1903 to 1979, and Belize, which is a constitutional monarchy and was known as British Honduras until 1973). However, the U.S. never acted on these proposals from some U.S. politicians; some of which were never delivered or considered seriously. In 2001, El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as its currency, while Panama has used it for decades due to its ties to the Canal Zone.

====Cuba====
In 1854 the Ostend Manifesto outlined a rationale for the U.S. to purchase Cuba from Spain, implying it might take the island by force if Spain refused. Once the document was published, many northern states denounced it.

In 1859, Senator John Slidell introduced a bill to purchase Cuba from Spain.

Cuba, like many Spanish territories, wanted to break free from Spain. A pro-independence movement in Cuba was supported by the U.S., and Cuban guerrilla leaders wanted annexation to the United States, but Cuban revolutionary leader José Martí called for Cuban nationhood. When the U.S. battleship &quot;Maine&quot; sank in Havana Harbor, the U.S. blamed Spain and the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. After the U.S. won, Spain relinquished claim of sovereignty over territories, including Cuba. The U.S. administered Cuba as a protectorate until 1902. Several decades later in 1959, the Cuban government of U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista was overthrown by Fidel Castro who subsequently installed a Marxist–Leninist government. After Castro nationalized private properties that were mostly owned by American companies, the U.S. refused to trade with Cuba, Cuba allied with the Soviet Union who imported Cuban sugar, Cuba&#x27;s main export. The government installed by Fidel Castro has been in power ever since. In 2016, the U.S. eased trade and travel restrictions against Cuba that had been put in place as a consequence of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

====Dominica====
In 1898, one news outlet in the Caribbean noted growing sentiments of resentment of British rule in Dominica, including its system of administration. The publication attempted to gauge sentiments concerning annexation to the United States as a way to change this system of administration.

====Dominican Republic====
On June 30, 1870, the United States Senate voted against an annexation treaty with the Dominican Republic.

====Greenland====
During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany, the United States briefly controlled Greenland for battlefields and protection, since the nation was in a strategic position. In 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for ( as of 2024) but Denmark refused to sell. Some have in recent years argued that Greenland would hypothetically be better off financially as part of the United States; for instance this was mentioned by Professor Gudmundur Alfredsson at the University of Akureyri, Iceland in 2014. One possible reason for U.S. interest in Greenland is its vast natural resources. According to The Arctic Institute, the U.S. appears to be highly interested in investing in the resources of the island and in tapping the expected vast amount of hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.

====Haiti====
&quot;Time&quot; columnist Mark Thompson suggested that Haiti had effectively become the 51st state after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, with the widespread destruction prompting a quick and extensive response from the United States, even so far as stationing of the U.S. military in Haitian air and seaports to facilitate foreign aid.

===Europe===

====Albania====
Albania has been called the 51st state for its perceived strongly pro-American positions, and the United States&#x27; policies towards it. In reference to President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2007 European tour, Edi Rama, Tirana&#x27;s mayor and leader of the opposition Socialists, said: &quot;Albania is for sure the most pro-American country in Europe, maybe even in the world ... Nowhere else can you find such respect and hospitality for the President of the United States. Even in Michigan, he wouldn&#x27;t be as welcome.&quot; At the time of ex-Secretary of State James Baker&#x27;s visit in 1992, there was a move to hold a referendum declaring the country as the 51st American state. In addition to Albania, Kosovo (which is predominately Albanian) is seen as a 51st state due to the heavy presence and influence of the United States. The U.S. has had troops and the largest base outside U.S. territory, Camp Bondsteel, in the territory since 1999.

====Cartagena (Spain)====
In 1873, the leader of the Canton of Cartagena, Roque Barcia, requested that Cartagena become part of the United States in a letter to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Canton of Cartagena had emerged in the same year as a revolt against the First Spanish Republic. The United States Government never replied.

====Denmark====
In 1989, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published that Denmark becomes the 51st state every Fourth of July, because Danish citizens in and around Aalborg celebrate the American Independence Day in a small gathering called the Rebild Festival.

====Poland====
Poland has historically been staunchly pro-American, dating to General Tadeusz Kościuszko and Casimir Pulaski&#x27;s support of the American Revolution. This pro-American stance was reinforced following favorable American intervention in World War I (leading to the creation of an independent Poland) and the Cold War (culminating in a Polish state independent of Soviet influence). Poland contributed a large force to the &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; in Iraq. A quote referring to Poland as &quot;the 51st state&quot; has been attributed to James Pavitt, then Central Intelligence Agency Deputy Director for Operations, especially in connection to extraordinary rendition.

====Italy====
The Italian Unionist Movement was a political party briefly active during and after World War II, with the goal of an annexation of Italy to the United States.

In Sicily, the Party of Reconstruction was one of several Sicilian nationalist and separatist movements active after the downfall of Italian Fascism. Sicilians felt neglected or underrepresented by the Italian government after the annexation of 1861 that ended the rule of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies based in Naples. It claimed 40,000 members in 1944, and campaigned for Sicily to be admitted as a U.S. state.

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom has sometimes been called the 51st state due to the Special Relationship in United Kingdom–United States relations, particularly since the close cooperation between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill during World War II, and more recently during the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.

In an April 5, 1999 article in &quot;Forbes&quot;, historian Paul Johnson proposed that, as an alternative to the European Union, the UK should become ten states (one each for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with England divided into seven). He went on to suggest that then Canada (as one state per province), Australia, and New Zealand should also join this expanded United States.

In a 2011 column in &quot;The Times&quot;, journalist David Aaronovitch joked that the UK should consider joining the United States as its 51st state, because Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom and Brexit would otherwise lead to terminal decline. He also made an alternative case that England, Scotland, and Wales should be three separate states, with Northern Ireland joining the Republic of Ireland and becoming an all-Ireland state.

The UK band New Model Army released the song &quot;51st State&quot; in 1986. The lyrics facetiously refer to the &quot;Star Spangled Union Jack&quot; and describes the UK as culturally and politically dominated by the United States. The song &quot;Heartland&quot; by The The from the same year ends with the refrain &quot;This is the 51st state of the U.S.A.&quot;

==== Ukraine ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene controversially referred to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a &quot;shadow president (of the United States)&quot;, remarking that Ukraine was also the &quot;51st state&quot; due to the &quot;insane amount&quot; of American support for Ukraine in the war.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, the term &#x27;51st state&#x27; is used to disparage the perceived invasion of American cultural or political influence.

====New Zealand====
In 2010, there was an attempt to register a &quot;51st State Party&quot; with the New Zealand Electoral Commission. The party advocates New Zealand becoming the 51st state of the United States of America. The party&#x27;s secretary is Paulus Telfer, a former Christchurch mayoral candidate. On February 5, 2010, the party applied to register a logo with the Electoral Commission. The logoa U.S. flag with 51 starswas rejected by the Electoral Commission on the grounds that it was likely to cause confusion or mislead electors.

===Asia===
====Okinawa (Japan)====
In Article 3 of the Treaty of San Francisco between the Allied Powers and Japan, which came into force in April 1952, the U.S. put the outlying islands of the Ryukyus, including the island of Okinawa (home to over 1 million Okinawans related to the Japanese), the Bonin Islands, and the Volcano Islands (including Iwo Jima) into U.S. trusteeship. All these trusteeships were slowly returned to Japanese rule. Okinawa was returned on May 15, 1972, but the U.S. stations troops in the island&#x27;s bases as a defense for Japan. The continued military presence has been described as a 51st state.

====Israel and Palestinian territories====
Several sources assert that the State of Israel functions as a 51st state due to the annual funding, defense and overall support it receives from the United States. An example of this is the 2003 book by Martine Rothblatt called &quot;Two Stars for Peace&quot; that argued for the addition of Israel and the Palestinian territories as the 51st and 52nd states of the Union. &quot;The American State of Canaan&quot; is a book by political scientist and sociologist Alfred de Grazia from March 2009, proposing the creation of the &quot;State of Canaan&quot; from Israel and Palestine.

==== Iran ====
According to Iran&#x27;s IRGC Commander-in-Chief Salami, before the 1979 Iranian revolution, Iran was practically the 51st state of the United States. In 1978, Jimmy Carter traveled to Iran where he famously stated that Iran has become &quot;an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world&quot;, even saying that Iran was the country most important for American national interests and when he entered Iran, he felt like it was America&#x27;s &quot;54th state&quot;.

====Iraq====
Several publications suggested that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a neocolonialist war to make Iraq into the 51st U.S. state, though such statements are usually made facetiously.

====Taiwan====
A poll in 2003 among Taiwanese residents aged between 13 and 22 found that, when given the options of either becoming a province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China or a state within the U.S., 55% of the respondents preferred statehood while 36% chose joining China. A group called Taiwan Civil Government, established in Taipei in 2008, claims that the island of Taiwan and other minor islands are a territory of the United States.

====Hong Kong====
The idea of admission to the United States was discussed among some netizens based on Hong Kong&#x27;s mature common law system, long tradition of liberalism and vibrant civil society making it a global financial hub similar to London or New York. Alongside proposals of becoming independent (within or outside the Commonwealth, as a republic or a Commonwealth realm), rejoining the Commonwealth, confederation with Canada as the eleventh province or the fourth territory (with reference to Ken McGoogan&#x27;s proposal regarding Scotland), returning to British rule as a dependent territory, joining Taiwan (Republic of China) or acceding to other federations as a city-state.

=== Africa ===

==== Liberia ====

There are no African countries historically tied to the United States more closely than Liberia. Established by the American Colonization Society in 1822 as a home for freed Black Americans, Liberia&#x27;s capital, Monrovia, was named after James Monroe, the fifth U.S. president. Liberia has sometimes been regarded as a &quot;mini-America&quot; on the West African coast because its people speak English, use U.S. customary units, have modeled the flag after the Stars and Stripes and even created a U.S.-style constitution. Many Liberians regard the U.S. as their &quot;mother country&quot;. &quot;We are the 51st state,&quot; said Herbert Walker, a Liberian street merchant. &quot;We sang your national anthem and learned American history. We love American dollars.&quot;

<text>Baron Suffield, of Suffield in the County of Norfolk, is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The barony was created in 1786 for Sir Harbord Harbord, 2nd Baronet, who had previously represented Norwich as Member of Parliament in the House of Commons for thirty years (1756–86).

The Harbord baronetcy, of Suffield in the County of Norfolk, had been created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 22 March 1746 for his father Sir William Harbord, also a former Member of Parliament and who represented what are now termed the &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; of Bere Alston and Dunwich.

Born William Morden, he assumed the surname of Harbord by Act of Parliament in 1742 in compliance with the Will of his maternal uncle. The first Baron&#x27;s eldest son and successor as second Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk (1808–21). His younger brother, the third Baron, represented Yarmouth and Shaftesbury as a Whig MP in the House of Commons and after succeeding to the title in 1821, became a Liberal pioneer and leading advocate for the abolition of slavery in the House of Lords.

His younger son, the fifth Baron (who succeeded his half-brother), served in 1886 as Master of the Buckhounds in William Gladstone&#x27;s third administration, being sworn of the Privy Council the same year, and was appointed KCB (1876) and GCVO (1901). His eldest son, the sixth Baron, was Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1915 to 1918. On the death of his younger son, the eighth Baron, the line of the fifth Baron expired. The title was inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s first cousin once removed, who succeeded as the ninth Baron; he was the third son of the Hon. William Harbord, a captain in the British Army, and fourth son of the third Baron. He was succeeded in 1946 by his first cousin as the tenth Baron; he was the son of Reverend the Hon. John Harbord, fifth son of the third Baron. He served as an admiral in the Royal Navy during World War I and was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Norfolk. In 1917 he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Hamond (that of his maternal grandfather, Anthony Hamond). The eleventh Baron served in the British Army during World War II being awarded the Military Cross in 1950, among other decorations. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s second son, the thirteenth Baron, who succeeded his brother in 2016.

<doc id="475494" wikidata="Q3536910" url="?curid=475494" title="Treaty of Washington (1871)">
<text>The Treaty of Washington was a treaty signed and ratified by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1871 during the first premiership of William Gladstone and the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. It settled various disputes between the countries, including the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims for damages to American shipping caused by British-built warships, as well as illegal fishing in Canadian waters and British civilian losses in the American Civil War. It inaugurated permanent peaceful relations between the United States and Canada, and also with the United Kingdom. After the arbitrators endorsed the American position in 1872, Britain settled the matter by paying the United States $15.5 million (approximately $ million in ), ending the dispute and leading to a treaty that restored friendly relations between Britain and the United States. That international arbitration established a precedent, and the case aroused interest in codifying public international law.

==Background==

In early 1871, the British government sent Sir John Rose to the United States to ascertain whether negotiations to settle the Northwestern boundary dispute would be acceptable to President Ulysses S. Grant. The U.S. government through Grant&#x27;s Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, cordially received his advances and, on January 26, Sir Edward Thornton, the British Minister at Washington formally proposed the appointment of a joint high commission to meet in Washington to resolve the dispute. The United States consented, provided that the differences growing out of the Civil War be among the subjects to be considered. The British government accepted the American proviso and the president appointed commissioners.

==Joint commission==
The British government selected as its commissioners the Earl de Grey and Ripon, Sir Stafford Northcote, Lord Tenterden, Sir Edward Thornton, Mountague Bernard, and Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. President Grant appointed as U.S. commissioners Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, who was chairman, Robert Schenck, Ebenezer R. Hoar, George Henry Williams, Samuel Nelson, and J.C. Bancroft Davis.

Although the treaty was signed in the name of the United Kingdom, Macdonald&#x27;s presence established that the newly formed Dominion of Canada would at least take part in settling foreign matters that affected it directly, especially with respect to dealings with the United States. The joint commission entered upon its task and on 8 May concluded a treaty which received the prompt approval of the two governments. Aside from the settlement of the dispute growing out of the so-called &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, provision was made for the adjustment of the differences with regard to the northeastern fisheries by the appointment of a mixed commission to meet at Halifax and pass upon the relative value of certain reciprocal privileges granted each of the contracting parties. In 1877, the Halifax Fisheries Commission appointed under the treaty directed the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government as compensation.

Finally, a provision was made whereby William I, German Emperor, would be arbitrator of the Pig War dispute concerning the maritime boundary surrounding the San Juan Islands. The choice of the emperor as arbitrator reflected the prestige Germany had acquired after its victory in the Franco-Prussian War, and the trust both the United States and the United Kingdom had in the Berlin government. The issue in dispute concerning the San Juan Islands traced to ambiguous wording of a previous 1846 treaty. William I issued his finding on October 21, 1872, holding that the entire San Juan archipelago belong to the United States.

At Geneva, in 1872, the United States was awarded $15,500,000 pursuant to the terms of the treaty, and the British apologized for the destruction caused by the British-built Confederate ships but admitted no guilt. However, no compensation for damages done to the U.S. by British-built blockade runners carrying arms supplies to the Confederacy was offered.

The lack of compensation from Canada greatly irritated Macdonald, but he nonetheless signed the treaty under the argument that he was a junior member of the British delegation. The treaty was published in the Canadian press to widespread condemnation, but Macdonald remained silent on the issue. When it came time to debate the treaty in the House of Commons of Canada, he revealed that he had been secretly negotiating for a better deal and had obtained a cash payment from the Americans for the use of Canadian fishing grounds, and in lieu of any claim against the United States over the Fenians. Furthermore, the British had agreed to a guaranteed loan of £3,600,000 for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This masterstroke of diplomacy and statecraft allowed an otherwise deeply unpopular treaty to be ratified by the Parliament of Canada.

==Impact on international law==
The scholar of international law John Bassett Moore called this treaty &quot;the greatest treaty of actual and immediate arbitration the world has ever seen.&quot; These included so-called rules of Washington agreed upon by the contracting parties for the guidance of the tribunal in the interpretation of certain terms used in the treaty and of certain principles of international law governing the obligations of neutrals:
# That due diligence &quot;ought to be exercised by neutral governments in exact proportion to the risks to which either of the belligerents may be exposed, from a failure to fulfill the obligations of neutrality on their part.&quot;
# &quot;The effects of a violation of neutrality committed by means of the construction, equipment, and armament of a vessel are not done away with by any commission which the government of the belligerent power benefited by the violation of neutrality may afterward have granted to that vessel; and the ultimate step by which the offense is completed cannot be admissible as a ground for the absolution of the, nor can the consummation of his fraud become the means of establishing his innocence.&quot;
# &quot;The principle of extraterritoriality has been admitted into the laws of nations, not as an absolute right, but solely as a proceeding founded on the principle of courtesy and mutual deference between different nations, and therefore can never be appealed to for the protection of acts done in violation of neutrality.&quot;

These rules affected the 1878 Congress of Berlin, and the precedent set by these rules would eventually grow into League of Nations and the United Nations.

==Implications==
The Treaty of Washington had a significant effect on the Americans&#x27; long-term relationship with Canada and Britain. Since the Rush-Bagot Treaty demilitarized the Canada–US border, the resolution of outstanding issues via the Treaty of Washington and the industrialization of the Great Lakes region, the risk of war between the United States and the United Kingdom became highly unlikely and was never seriously considered by either side again. The United States government mostly ceased official talk of annexing Canada. The treaty laid the foundation for The Great Rapprochement, the convergence of interests between the United Kingdom and the United States.

<doc id="475496" wikidata="Q2537602" url="?curid=475496" title="The Life of Oharu">
<text>is a 1952 Japanese historical drama film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The screenplay by Yoshikata Yoda is based on various stories from Saikaku Ihara&#x27;s 1686 work &quot;The Life of an Amorous Woman&quot;. Kinuyo Tanaka stars as Oharu, a one-time concubine of a &quot;daimyō&quot; (and mother of a later &quot;daimyō&quot;) who struggles to escape the stigma of having been forced into prostitution by her father.

==Plot==
The story opens on Oharu as an old woman in a temple, looking at a vast collection of statues of Arhats, whose faces remind her of the events of her life. As a young woman in a noble family, the daughter of a samurai, she is courted by a neighboring Lord&#x27;s retainer, Katsunosuke, and runs away with him. They are caught, and as a result (due to their class difference) he is executed and her family banished from court. Oharu attempts suicide but fails. Sometime later, a messenger from the local Lord visits her village in search of a mistress for the Lord. After an exhaustive search, Oharu is found to meet every criterion and is sold to Lord Matsudaira with the hope she will bear him a son. She does, but then, with her purpose served, is sent home with minimal compensation to the dismay of her father, who has worked up quite a debt in the meantime. He sends her to be a courtesan in the pleasure district, but there, too, she fails and is again sent home.

Oharu goes to serve the family of a woman who must hide the fact that she is bald from her husband. When Oharu&#x27;s past as a courtesan becomes known, the woman&#x27;s husband hopes to take advantage of her. His wife becomes jealous of Oharu and makes her chop off her hair, but Oharu retaliates, revealing the woman&#x27;s secret. She again must leave—this time she marries a fan maker who is killed shortly after during a robbery. She attempts to become a nun, but Oharu is thrown out after being caught naked with a man seeking reimbursement for an unauthorized gift (it is made clear this is rape by Oharu&#x27;s claims and distraught demeanor). She is thrown out of the temple, becomes a prostitute, but fails even at that.

The narrative finally returns to the opening scene, in the temple full of statues. Oharu collapses. When she awakens, her mother is by her bedside, having heard a rumor as to where Oharu was living. She learns that her father has died, and that so too has Lord Matsudaira. Oharu&#x27;s son is now the young Lord, and is searching for his mother. Hoping to meet him and live in his palace, she returns to the Lord&#x27;s house, only to be chastised for the &quot;shameful&quot; events of her life after her banishment from the palace so long ago. To keep her past a secret, she is to be imprisoned within the compounds, never to leave, but also never to be with her son. The young lord does deign to grant her the one-time privilege of looking upon him as he walks by. She chases after him through the compound, is herself pursued by his guards, and in the confusion, ends up escaping to pass the rest of her life as a wandering nun, begging for alms at every doorstep.

<doc id="475497" wikidata="Q7928927" url="?curid=475497" title="Vigilantes of Love">
<text>Vigilantes of Love was an American rock band fronted by Bill Mallonee, with many secondary players drawn from the musician pool in and around Athens, Georgia, United States. In its later manifestations in the later 1990s and early 2000s, Mallonee usually sang, played lead and rhythm guitar and harmonica, although in earlier bands he played drums.

The band takes its name from the New Order song &quot;Love Vigilantes,&quot; although their sound tends more to folk, Americana, and country rock than new wave. Their 2001 album &quot;Summershine&quot; also showed some movement toward Britpop and R.E.M.-style college rock, which would be more fully explored in Mallonee&#x27;s solo career.

==History==

The band formed in 1990 in Athens, Georgia, where Bill Mallonee attended the University of Georgia. The act developed as a mostly acoustic, side-project of The Cone Ponies, the last in a long series of line-ups beginning in the mid-1980s with Windows and Walls, and Bed of Roses. For their first two recording projects—&quot;Jugular&quot; and &quot;Drivin&#x27; the Nails&quot;—the band performed as a trio between Mallonee, Mark Hall (accordion), and Jonathan &quot;Dog-Mess Jonny&quot; Evans (harmonica). The Athens, Georgia, performance venues in which they were booked regularly included The Flying Buffalo, the 40-Watt Club, Rockfish Palace, Uptown Lounge, and their musical &quot;home&quot;—The Downstairs Restaurant (now DT&#x27;s Down Under). For the third and subsequent albums, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Billy Holmes played an increasingly important role. Later, when greater local success led increasingly to engagements more widely in the Southeast, and with the departure of Mark Hall and Dog-Mess Jonny, the band then re-formed as a traditional touring four-piece rock band including front man Mallonee, Newton Carter, David LaBruyere (later became bass player for John Mayer), and Travis McNabb (later of Better Than Ezra and Sugarland).

The band was signed to Capricorn Records following their third album, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. Mallonee has stated that Capricorn&#x27;s lack of investment in a music video to support Vigilantes made it difficult for them to break out in the broader marketplace.

With Mallonee serving as Vigilantes of Love&#x27;s frontman, the band&#x27;s &quot;Double Cure&quot; was nominated for a 1997 Dove Award in the Alternative/Modern Rock Recorded Song of the Year category. The band experienced controversy in the CCM market for the song &quot;Love Cocoon.&quot; The song, which described marital sex, led to the band&#x27;s album &quot;Slow Dark Train&quot; being dropped by some Christian bookstores.

After many years of successful touring nationally and abroad — the UK and the Netherlands being particularly fond of Mallonnee&#x27;s music. The band disbanded in 2001 as Mallonee went solo as a singer-songwriter/guitarist/raconteur playing to the renewed interest in roots-music Americana.

<doc id="475498" wikidata="Q4862816" url="?curid=475498" title="Baron Somers">
<text>Baron Somers, of Evesham in the County of Worcester, is a title that has been created twice. The title was first created in the Peerage of England in 1697 for Sir John Somers, so that he could sit in the House of Lords and serve as Lord Chancellor. The title became extinct on Lord Somers&#x27; death in 1716. His sister and co-heiress, Mary Somers, married Charles Cocks, a member of a prominent Worcestershire family. Their grandson Charles Cocks represented Reigate in Parliament from 1747 to 1784, and was created a baronet, of Dumbleton in the County of Gloucester, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1772. In 1784 the barony held by his great-uncle was revived when he was made Baron Somers, of Evesham in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain.

His eldest son, the second Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for West Looe, Grampound and Reigate and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire. In 1821 he was created Viscount Eastnor, of Eastnor Castle in the County of Hereford, and Earl Somers. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Reigate and Hereford in the House of Commons and like his father served as Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire. In 1841 Lord Somers assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Somers. His son, the third Earl, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate.

However, on his death in 1883, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his first cousin once removed, the fifth Baron. He was the son of Philip James Cocks, third son of the first Baron. On his death, the title passed to his great-nephew, the sixth Baron. He was a Conservative politician and also served as Governor of Victoria. He was succeeded by his uncle, the seventh Baron. His son, the eighth Baron, was a professor at the Royal College of Music. On his death in 1995, the titles passed to his second cousin once removed, the ninth and () present holder of the baronetcy and barony. He is a great-grandson of John James Thomas Somers Cocks, younger brother of the fifth Baron.

The ancestral seat of the Cocks family was Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire. It is now in the hands of a female-line grandson of the sixth Baron Somers.

The title of the barony is pronounced &quot;Summers&quot;.

<text>Kirov Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) located in Eastern Europe. Its administrative center is the city of Kirov. As of the 2010 census, the population is 1,341,312.

==Geography==

===Natural resources===
Natural resources include forests (mostly conifers), phosphate rock, peat, furs, water and land. There are widespread deposits of peat and non-metallic minerals: limestone, marl, clay, sand and gravel, as well as the rare mineral volkonskoite. 

In recent decades, a minor recoverable oil reserve was revealed in the east of the region, as well as deposits of bentonite clays. The region also contains the Vyatsko-Kama deposit of phosphate rock, the largest in Europe. Rich in mineral springs, the Kumyonsky District contains the resort town of Nizhneivkino.

===Hydrography===
Kirov Oblast is characterized by diverse hydrography, including numerous rivers, lakes, and reservoirs which play an essential role in its geography, economy, and ecology. The hydrographic network of Kirov Oblast is dominated by the Volga River basin, one of the largest river systems in Europe, but additionally encompasses the Severodvinsk.

The rivers in Kirov Oblast are numerous, with more than 19,000 rivers and streams and spanning 66.7 kilometers. Some of the most significant rivers include the Vyatka, Moloma, Cheptsa, and Kama rivers. The region contains approximately 4,500 lakes, many of which are of glacial origin, with a combined water surface area of 5.5 million hectares. These lakes provide habitats for various species of fish and birds and are often used for recreational purposes. The rivers and lakes of Kirov Oblast are integral to the region&#x27;s natural environment and economy, providing water for agriculture, supporting fisheries, and transportation.

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vyatka remained a place of exile for opponents of the tsarist regime, including many prominent revolutionary figures. In 1920, a number of small southern and eastern districts (volosti) and villages were shifted from Vyatka as a result of the formation of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Mari and Votskaya (now the Udmurt Republic) autonomous regions.

The territory did not escape the Russian Civil War and intervention of 1918–1921. Then between 1921 and 1922, it was hit by famine, followed by a typhus epidemic in late 1922. The death rate doubled during those years. The postwar period was accompanied by rebuilding of the province on the basis of the New Economic Policy (NEP), which consisted of free trade, entrepreneurship, and private sector stimulation. 

The country&#x27;s first office of the International Organization for Aid to Fighters of the Revolution (IOAR) began operations here in January 1923.

The administrative and territorial reforms of 1929 eliminated the old division of the country into provinces and districts (Uezd, Volost) and introduced a new system of division into regions, territories, and districts (raiony). Vyatka Province was abolished, and its territory became part of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The city of Vyatka became a district center.

On 5 December 1934, the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) passed a resolution renaming the city from Vyatka to Kirov, and Kirov Oblast was formed on 7 December. It included the Udmurt Autonomous Region, 37 districts (raiony) of Gorki Region (which had formerly been part of Vyatka Province), as well as Sapapulsky and Votkinsky districts of Sverdlovsk Region. Following the adoption of the new Constitution in 1936, Kirov Territory was transformed into Kirov Region and the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was separated from it. 

On 30 October 1997, Kirov, alongside Astrakhan, Murmansk, Ulyanovsk, and Yaroslavl, signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement would be abolished on 24 January 2002.

==Administrative divisions==
Kirov Oblast was formed on 7 December 1934. It is divided administratively into 39 districts, 6 cities under oblast jurisdiction, 13 town under district jurisdiction, 58 urban-type settlements, and 580 selsoviets.

==Economy==
Kirov Oblast is part of the Volga–Vyatka economic district located in the central part of European Russia in the Volga and Vyatka river basins. Its economic complex had already begun forming and developing before the Revolution, in large part because of the transfer points and trading posts located in Vyatka, which later led to the formation of large . Trading Centers Agriculture was the priority sector at first, but starting in 1940, there was an upsurge in development of an industrial complex, especially the engineering, metalworking, and chemical industries.

Kirov Oblast is part of the Volga–Vyatka agricultural zone, where more than half of the area sown in grain is located in Kirov Oblast itself. Agricultural land occupies 27% of the region&#x27;s territory. The most important grain crops are winter and spring wheat and rye. Barley and oats are grown for fodder. Increased specialization in the production of more promising fodder crops like winter rye, barley, oats that are most suited to the Oblast&#x27;s climatic conditions is anticipated in the future. Potatoes are also extensively cultivated.

===Transportation===
*The Dymnoye peat railway operates in Verkhnekamsky District
*The Gorokhovskoye peat railway operates in Kotelnichsky District
*The Otvorskoye peat railway operates in Kotelnichsky District
*The Pishchalskoye peat railway operates in Orichevsky District
*The Kobrinskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in Murashinsky District
*The Oparinskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in Oparinsky District

===Petroleum infrastructure===
====2024 oil infrastructure attack====
The Kirov Oblast is the site of the Rosrezerves&#x27; Zenit oil depot in Kotelnich, a large petroleum tank farm installation of the Russian State Reserve.

On 28 August 2024, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was attacked and set ablaze by a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone strike. This was the first attack on the region since the start of hostilities, and is deep in inland Russia, over 1000 km from the Ukrainian border.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kirov CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Kirov Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Kirov Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

<doc id="475502" wikidata="Q1379781" url="?curid=475502" title="Mike McConnell (U.S. Naval officer)">
<text>J. Michael &quot;Mike&quot; McConnell (born July 26, 1943) is a former vice admiral in the United States Navy. He served as Director of the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996 and as the United States Director of National Intelligence from February 2007 to January 2009 during the Bush administration and first week of the Obama administration. As of January 2024, he is the Vice Chairman at Booz Allen Hamilton.

==Early life, education, and family==
McConnell was born and grew up in Greenville, South Carolina. 
 He graduated from Wade Hampton High School (Greenville, South Carolina) in 1964, and first attended college at North Greenville Junior College, later earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Furman University. He holds a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University, and is a graduate of the National Defense University and the National Defense Intelligence College (Strategic Intelligence). He is married to Terry McConnell, and together they have four children and nine grandchildren.

==Military and intelligence career==

McConnell received his commission in the United States Navy in 1967. He worked as the Intelligence Officer (J2) for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of Defense during Operation Desert Shield/Storm and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He developed approaches for improving information flow among intelligence agencies and combat forces in the Gulf War.

From 1992 to 1996, McConnell served as Director of the National Security Agency (NSA). He led NSA as it adapted to the multi-polar threats brought about by the end of the Cold War. Under his leadership, NSA routinely provided global intelligence and information security services to the White House, Cabinet officials, the United States Congress, and a broad array of military and civilian intelligence customers. He also served as a member of the Director of Central Intelligence senior leadership team to address major intelligence programmatic and substantive issues from 1992 until 1996.

In 1996, McConnell retired from the Navy as a vice admiral after 29 years of service – 26 as a career Intelligence Officer. In addition to many of the nation&#x27;s highest military awards for meritorious service, he holds the nation&#x27;s highest award for service in the Intelligence Community. He also served as the Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance.

McConnell was the second person to hold the position of Director of National Intelligence. He was nominated by President George W. Bush on January 5, 2007, and was sworn in at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., on February 20, 2007. McConnell&#x27;s appointment to the post was initially greeted with broad bipartisan support, although he has since attracted criticism for advocating some of the Bush administration&#x27;s more controversial policies.

Before his nomination as DNI, McConnell had served as a Senior Vice President with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, focusing on the Intelligence and National Security areas. From 2005 until his confirmation as DNI in 2007, he was also chairman of the board of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, the &quot;premier not-for-profit, nonpartisan, private sector professional organization providing a structure and interactive forum for thought leadership, the sharing of ideas, and networking within the intelligence and national security communities&quot; whose members include leaders in industry, government, and academia.

On Tuesday, August 14, 2007, McConnell visited Texas with House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes to review border security, and granted a wide-ranging interview to the &quot;El Paso Times&quot; newspaper, which surprised many in the intelligence community for its candor on sensitive topics such as the recent changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. At the end of the interview, McConnell cautioned reporter Chris Roberts that he should consider whether enemies of the U.S. could gain from the information he just shared, leaving it up to the paper to decide what to publish. The &quot;El Paso Times&quot; put the entire, unexpurgated interview on their website on August 22, with executive editor Dionicio Flores saying &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it damaged national security or endangered any of our people.&quot;

A resurgent Taliban is back in charge over parts of Afghanistan, McConnell told CNN on February 27, 2008, in an assessment that differed from the one made January 2008 by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.

On January 24, 2009, it was announced that McConnell would return to Booz Allen as a Senior Vice President.

==Initiatives as DNI==
===100 Day Plan for Integration and Collaboration===
Two months after taking office, McConnell created a series of initiatives designed to build the foundation for increased cooperation and reform of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). His plan, dubbed &quot;100 Day Plan for Integration and Collaboration&quot; focused on efforts to enable the IC to act as a unified enterprise in a collaborative manner. It focused on six enterprise integration priorities:
# Create a Culture of Collaboration
# Foster Collection and Analytic Transformation
# Build Acquisition Excellence and Technology Leadership
# Modernize Business Practices
# Accelerate Information Sharing
# Clarify and Align DNI&#x27;s Authorities

Subsequently, a 500 Day Plan was designed to sustain the momentum with an expanded set of initiatives and a greater level of participation. It was set to deepen integration of the Community&#x27;s people, processes, and technologies. The plan addressed a new performance management framework that entails six performance elements that all agencies must have.

===500 Day Plan for Integration and Collaboration===
The 100 Day Plan was meant to &quot;jump start&quot; a series of initiatives based on a deliberate planning process with specific deadlines and measures to ensure that needed reforms were implemented. The 500 Day Plan, which started in August 2007, was designed to accelerate and sustain this momentum with an expanded set of initiatives and broader IC participation. It contains 10 &quot;core&quot; initiatives which will be tracked by the senior leadership in the Intelligence Community, and 33 &quot;enabling&quot; initiatives. The initiatives are based on the same six focus areas described in the 100 Day Plan.

The top initiatives are:

# Treat Diversity as a Strategic Mission Imperative
# Implement Civilian IC Joint Duty Program
# Enhance Information Sharing Policies, Processes, and Procedures
# Create Collaborative Environment for All Analysts
# Establish National Intelligence Coordination Center
# Implement Acquisition Improvement Plan
# Modernize the Security Clearance Process
# Align Strategy, Budget, and Capabilities through a Strategic Enterprise Management System
# Update Policy Documents Clarifying and Aligning IC Authorities

Director McConnell ended office near the 400th day of his 500-day plan.

===Updating FISA===
McConnell approached Congress in early August 2007 on the need to &quot;modernize FISA,&quot; claiming two changes were needed (initial efforts began in April – see the factsheet for more). First, the Intelligence Community should not be required, because of technology changes since 1978, to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence from &quot;foreign targets&quot; located overseas. He also argued that telecoms being sued for violating the nation&#x27;s wiretapping laws must be protected from liability—regardless of the veracity of the charges. Shortly thereafter, McConnell took an active role on Capitol Hill for legislation being drafted by Congress. On August 3, McConnell announced that he &quot;strongly oppose[d]&quot; the House&#x27;s proposal because it wasn&#x27;t strong enough. After heated debate, Congress updated FISA by passing the Protect America Act of 2007.

In that same testimony, McConnell blamed the death of a kidnapped American soldier in Iraq on the requirements of FISA and the slowness of the courts. However, a timeline later released showed that the delays were mostly inside the NSA, casting doubt again on McConnell&#x27;s truthfulness.
McConnell, speaking to a Congressional panel in defense of the Protect America Act, said that the Russian and Chinese foreign intelligence services are nearly as active as during the Cold War. In other September 18, 2007 testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, McConnell addressed the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, saying that that agency had conducted no telephone surveillance of Americans without obtaining a warrant in advance since he became Director of National Intelligence in February, 2007. McConnell called FISA a &quot;foundational law&quot; with &quot;important legacy of protecting the rights of Americans,&quot; which was passed in the era of Watergate and in the aftermath of the Church and Pike investigations. He stressed that changes should honor that legacy for privacy and against foreign threats.

===Analytic Outreach===
July 2008, Director McConnell issued a directive (ICD 205) for analysts to build relationships with outside experts on topics of concern to the intelligence community—a recommendation highlighted in the WMD Commission Report.

===Updating Executive Order 12333===
Director McConnell worked with the White House to overhaul Executive Order 12333, which outlines fundamental guidance to intelligence agencies. McConnell believes the update is necessary to incorporate the intelligence community&#x27;s new organizations and new technologies and methods. The redo is expected to help the intelligence agencies work together, and to reflect the post 9/11 threat environment.

In July 2008, President Bush issued Executive Order 13470, which amended 12333.

===Information Integration and Sharing===
As one of McConnell&#x27;s last acts as DNI, he signed ICD501 &quot;Discovery and Dissemination or Retrieval of Information Within the Intelligence Community&quot; to dramatically increase access to several databases held by various agencies in the community. The policy establishes rules to govern disputes when access is not granted, with the DNI as the final adjudicator to resolve disputes between organizations. He also established the Intelligence Information Integration Program (I2P) under the leadership of then-CIO Patrick Gorman and then NSA-CIO Dr. Prescott Winter. The goal of I2P was to create a shared infrastructure and family of shared services as a means to increase information access, sharing and collaboration throughout the US Intelligence Community.

===Integrated Planning, Programming and Budgeting System===
McConnell led the effort to create an integrated planning, programming, and budgeting system to more fully integrate and optimize the capabilities of the Intelligence Community. Previously, each agency&#x27;s budget was developed independently and aggregated for Congress. After the issuance of ICD106 Strategic Enterprise Management (IC SEM), the Intelligence Community budget was more closely aligned to strategic goals and objectives, requirements, and performance criteria. ICD 106 was replaced by ICD 116 in 2011 ().

==Years after DNI==
In early April 2010, Admiral McConnell called for expanding the powers of the DNI by giving him tenure and creating a Department of Intelligence for the DNI to oversee and fully control to settle the continued fighting amongst agencies within various departments.
On February 12, 2020, Admiral McConnell was named the executive director of Cyber Florida. Cyber Florida is a state-funded organization hosted at USF that works with all 12 public universities in Florida, as well as private industry, government and the military to build partnerships and develop programs that grow and strengthen Florida&#x27;s cybersecurity industry.

<doc id="475505" wikidata="Q5282302" url="?curid=475505" title="Disk array controller">
<text>A disk array controller is a device that manages the physical disk drives and presents them to the computer as logical units. It often implements hardware RAID, thus it is sometimes referred to as RAID controller. It also often provides additional disk cache.

&quot;Disk array controller&quot; is often ambiguously shortened to &quot;disk controller&quot; which can also refer to the circuitry responsible for managing internal disk drive operations.

== Front-end and back-end side ==
A disk array controller provides front-end interfaces and back-end interfaces.
* The back-end interface communicates with the controlled disks. Hence, its protocol is usually ATA (a.k.a. PATA), SATA, SCSI, FC or SAS.
* The front-end interface communicates with a computer&#x27;s host adapter (HBA, Host Bus Adapter) and uses:
** one of ATA, SATA, SCSI, FC; these are popular protocols used by disks, so by using one of them a controller may transparently emulate a disk for a computer.
** somewhat less popular dedicated protocols for specific solutions: FICON/ESCON, iSCSI, HyperSCSI, ATA over Ethernet or InfiniBand.

A single controller &quot;may&quot; use different protocols for back-end and for front-end communication. Many enterprise controllers use FC on front-end and SATA on back-end.

== Enterprise controllers ==

In a modern enterprise architecture disk array controllers (sometimes also called storage processors, or SPs) are parts of physically independent enclosures, such as disk arrays placed in a storage area network (SAN) or network-attached storage (NAS) servers.

Those external disk arrays are usually purchased as an integrated subsystem of RAID controllers, disk drives, power supplies, and management software. It is up to controllers to provide advanced functionality (various vendors name these differently):
* Automatic failover to another controller (transparent to computers transmitting data)
* Long-running operations performed without downtime
** Forming a new RAID set
** Reconstructing &quot;degraded&quot; RAID set (after a disk failure)
** Adding a disk to online RAID set
** Removing a disk from a RAID set (rare functionality)
** Partitioning a RAID set to separate volumes/LUNs
* Snapshots
* Business continuance volumes (BCV)
* Replication with a remote controller...

== Simple controllers ==
A simple disk array controller may fit inside a computer, either as a PCI/PCIe expansion card or just built onto a motherboard. Such a controller usually provides host bus adapter (HBA) functionality itself to save physical space. Hence it is sometimes called a RAID adapter.

 Intel started integrating their own Matrix RAID controller in their more upmarket motherboards, giving control over 4 devices and an additional 2 SATA connectors, and totalling 6 SATA connections (3 Gbit/s each). For backward compatibility one IDE connector able to connect 2 ATA devices (100 Mbit/s) is also present.

=== History ===
While hardware RAID controllers have been available for a long time, they initially required expensive Parallel SCSI hard drives and aimed at the server and high-end computing market. SCSI technology advantages include allowing up to 15 devices on one bus, independent data transfers, hot-swapping, much higher MTBF.

Around 1997, with the introduction of ATAPI-4 (and thus Ultra-DMA-Mode, which enabled fast data transfers with less CPU utilization) the first ATA RAID controllers were introduced as PCI expansion cards. Those RAID systems made their way to the consumer market, for users wanting the fault-tolerance of RAID without investing in expensive SCSI drives.

Fast consumer drives make it possible to build RAID systems at lower cost than with SCSI, but most ATA RAID controllers lack a dedicated buffer or high-performance XOR hardware for parity calculation. As a result, ATA RAID performs relatively poorly compared to most SCSI RAID controllers. Additionally, data safety suffers if there is no battery backup to finish writes interrupted by a power outage.

==OS support==
Because the hardware RAID controllers present assembled RAID volumes, operating systems aren&#x27;t strictly required to implement the complete configuration and assembly for each controller. Very often only the basic features are implemented in the open-source software driver, with extended features being provided through binary blobs directly by the hardware manufacturer.

Normally, RAID controllers can be fully configured through card BIOS before an operating system is booted, and after the operating system is booted, proprietary configuration utilities are available from the manufacturer of each controller, because the exact feature set of each controller may be specific to each manufacturer and product.
Unlike the network interface controllers for Ethernet, which can be usually be configured and serviced entirely through the common operating system paradigms like ifconfig in Unix, without a need for any third-party tools, each manufacturer of each RAID controller usually provides their own proprietary software tooling for each operating system that they deem to support, ensuring a vendor lock-in, and contributing to reliability issues.

For example, in FreeBSD, in order to access the configuration of Adaptec RAID controllers, users are required to enable Linux compatibility layer, and use the Linux tooling from Adaptec, potentially compromising the stability, reliability and security of their setup, especially when taking the long term view in mind. However, this greatly depends on the controller, and whether appropriate hardware documentation is available in order to write a driver, and some controllers do have open-source versions of their configuration utilities, for example, codice_1 and codice_2 is available for FreeBSD since FreeBSD 8.0 (2009), as well as codice_3/codice_4 since 2015, each supporting only their respective device drivers, this latter fact contributing to code bloat.

Some other operating systems have implemented their own generic frameworks for interfacing with any RAID controller, and provide tools for monitoring RAID volume status, as well as facilitation of drive identification through LED blinking, alarm management, hot spare disk designations and from within the operating system without having to reboot into card BIOS. For example, this was the approach taken by OpenBSD in 2005 with its bio(4) pseudo-device driver and the bioctl utility, which provide volume status, and allow LED/alarm/hotspare control, as well as the sensors (including the drive sensor) for health monitoring; this approach has subsequently been adopted and extended by NetBSD in 2007 as well.

With bioctl, the feature set is intentionally kept to a minimum, so that each controller can be supported by the tool in the same way; the initial configuration of the controller is meant to be performed through card BIOS, but after the initial configuration, all day-to-day monitoring and repair should be possible with unified and generic tools, which is what bioctl is set to accomplish.

<doc id="475506" wikidata="Q1673164" url="?curid=475506" title="Ironside (cavalry)">
<text>The Ironsides were troopers in the Parliamentary cavalry trained by English political and military leader Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, during the English Civil War. The name came from &quot;Old Ironsides,&quot; one of Cromwell&#x27;s nicknames. It was after the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644 that Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the commander of the Royalist Army, &quot;first gave the nickname to his enemy of &#x27;Old Ironsides&#x27; because his ranks were so impenetrable--the name originated with the man and passed on to his regiment&quot; (Fraser, p. 132). 

==The model regiment==
Cromwell first mustered a troop of cavalry (then referred to as &quot;horse&quot;) at Huntingdon in Huntingdonshire, on 29 August 1642, early in the Civil War. John Desborough was quartermaster. The troop was late in being organised, and arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Edgehill, the first pitched battle of the war. Cromwell however did witness the defeat of the Parliamentarian horse at the battle and wrote to fellow Parliamentarian leader John Hampden,

Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their [&quot;the Royalists&#x27;&quot;] troopers are gentlemen&#x27;s sons, younger sons and persons of quality; do you think that the spirits of such base and mean fellows [&quot;as ours&quot;] will ever be able to encounter gentlemen that have honour and courage and resolution in them?

== Within the Eastern Association ==
It is evident that Cromwell&#x27;s answer to his own question lay in religious conviction. Early in 1643, he was given a commission as colonel and expanded his troop into a full regiment in the newly formed Army of the Eastern Association, under the command of Lord Grey of Warke and then the Earl of Manchester. By 11 September that year (1643), he referred to them in a letter to his cousin Oliver St. John as a &quot;lovely company&quot;. A champion of the &quot;godly&quot;, Cromwell became notorious for appointing men of comparatively humble origins but stoutly-held Puritan beliefs as officers, who would then attract men of similar background and leanings to the regiment. He wrote to Sir William Spring, who disagreed with this policy,

I had rather have a plain russet-coated captain that knows what he fights for and loves what he knows, than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else. I honour a gentleman that is so indeed.

On 28 July 1643, the regiment took part in the Battle of Gainsborough, where Royalist cavalry were defeated. One of the troop captains, James Berry, is stated to have killed the Royalist commander, Sir Charles Cavendish, a relation of the Marquess of Newcastle (Commander-in-Chief of the Royalist forces in the North).

The regiment&#x27;s troops in 1643 were:
*Colonel Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s
*Major Edward Whalley&#x27;s
*Captain John Desborough&#x27;s
*Captain Valentine Walton (Junior)&#x27;s
*Captain Oliver Cromwell (Junior)&#x27;s
*Captain James Berry&#x27;s
*Captain Robert Swallow&#x27;s, known as the &quot;Maiden Troop&quot; and drawn from Norwich.
*Captain Ralph Margery&#x27;s
*Captain Henry Ireton&#x27;s (Transferred from the Earl Of Essex&#x27;s regiment)

By April, 1644, after two years of war, Cromwell&#x27;s unit had grown into a &quot;double&quot; regiment of no less than 14 troops. (A regiment normally had only 6 troops). Cromwell by this time was Lieutenant General of the Horse in the Parliamentarian Army of the Eastern Association, and the regiment would be routinely commanded by its lieutenant colonel, Cromwell&#x27;s cousin Edward Whalley. The regiment played a major part in the victory over the Royalists at the Battle of Marston Moor, where the discipline of Cromwell&#x27;s wing of horse was decisive. Where a victorious wing of Royalist cavalry scattered in search of plunder, Cromwell&#x27;s men rallied after defeating their immediate opponents, and then swept the disordered Royalist armies from the field. Captain Valentine Walton, Cromwell&#x27;s nephew, died of wounds after a cannon shot smashed his leg during the battle.

It was a different story by the time of the Second Battle of Newbury later that year. The Parliamentarian high command of Sir William Waller, the Earl of Manchester, Sir William Balfour and Cromwell decided to split their large force into two. Cromwell, the Eastern and London Association Cavalry and the Southern Association headed across the river and toward Donnington Castle in the West. The regiment was part of the first attack on the King&#x27;s western forces under Goring and Astley, but was beaten back and had to be relieved by Cromwell&#x27;s fellow commander, Sir William Balfour, and his London horse.

==The template for the New Model Army==
Cromwell&#x27;s double regiment was later split into two regiments (Sir Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s and Edward Whalley&#x27;s), which became the nucleus of the New Model Army&#x27;s cavalry. Shortly before the Battle of Naseby, Cromwell was reappointed Lieutenant General of Horse in the army, and later became its commander. &quot;Ironsides&quot; seems to have become the term for all cavalry in the army, regardless of their origin.

Two &quot;divisions&quot; i.e. half-regiments of three troops each, one from each of Fairfax&#x27;s and Whalley&#x27;s regiments, under Major Christopher Bethel and Major John Desborough, mounted a remarkable charge at the Battle of Langport, where they galloped up a narrow lane and attacked the Royalist Army of Lord Goring in front, putting the entire army to flight.

==Dress, equipment and nature==

Although the phrase &quot;Ironside&quot; suggests heavily armoured men, Cromwell&#x27;s troops were equipped in the common cavalry style of the day, termed the harquebusier, with armour limited to a back and breastplate, and &quot;pot&quot; helmet. It does seem that they presented a uniform appearance which contrasted with that of the Cavalier horse, which became increasingly individual during the war through shortage of equipment or personal choice.

As Puritans, the Ironsides often attributed their glory in battle to God. Their religious beliefs extended to the field where they adhered to strict ethical codes. In quarters, they did not drink or gamble. They did not partake in the traditional spoils of war and did not rape, or pillage defeated opponents.

==In fiction==
The Ironsides are featured in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1953 historical fiction novel &quot;Simon&quot;, and are portrayed as being very professional soldiers with strong puritan religious tendencies.

==In music==
Lawrence J. Epstein writes that the lyric &quot;heaven is like Ironside&#x27;s&quot; in Bob Dylan&#x27;s I Pity the Poor Immigrant refers to the puritanical view of religion shared by the followers of Cromwell.

<text>Baron Carrington is a title that has been created three times, once in the Peerage of England, once in the Peerage of Ireland and once in the Peerage of Great Britain.

==History==

The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1643 in favour of Sir Charles Smyth, who became Baron Carrington of Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Only a few days later he was created Viscount Carrington in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his two sons, but in 1706 the titles became extinct. For more information, see this title.

The second creation came in 1796 when Robert Smith was created Baron Carrington, of Bulcot Lodge, in the Peerage of Ireland. He had earlier represented Nottingham in the House of Commons. Only one year later, in 1797, he was made Baron Carrington, of Upton in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain. This Smith family was unrelated to the Smyth family, Viscounts Carrington.

His son, the second Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Wendover, Buckinghamshire and High Wycombe, and served as Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. In 1839, the year after the death of his father, he changed his name to Carrington (with double-r) by Royal Licence. In 1880 he owned of land in Buckinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Bedfordshire, giving an annual rental income of £42,254.

His son, the third Baron, was a prominent Liberal politician. He and his brothers changed their name to Carington (with a single r) in 1880. He was created Viscount Wendover, of Chepping Wycombe in the County of Buckingham, and Earl Carrington, in 1895. The following year he changed his name to Wynn-Carington by Royal Licence. He was created Marquess of Lincolnshire in 1912. These three titles were all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Under King George V, Lord Lincolnshire held also the Lord Great Chamberlainship, one-quarter of which he had inherited from his mother. His only son and heir, Albert Edward Charles Robert Wynn-Carington, Viscount Wendover, was killed in action in World War I. Consequently, on Lord Lincolnshire&#x27;s death in 1928, the viscountcy, earldom and marquessate became extinct. His share of the Lord Great Chamberlainship was inherited by his five daughters as co-heiresses (one-twentieth each).

The 1796 and 1797 baronies passed to the Marquess of Lincolnshire&#x27;s younger brother, the fourth Baron. He had earlier represented Buckinghamshire in Parliament as a Liberal. His grandson the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1938, was a noted Conservative politician who served as Foreign Secretary from 1979 to 1982 and as Secretary General of NATO between 1984 and 1988. In 1999 he was given a life peerage as Baron Carington of Upton (spelled with a single r), of Upton in the County of Nottinghamshire, and thus continued as a member of the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 had removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to be members. From the death of Lord Jellicoe in 2007, he was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, having taken his seat in 1945, and also the oldest member. As of 2018, the baronies are held by his son Rupert Carington, 7th Baron Carrington, who is the current Lord Great Chamberlain since September 2022.

The Hon. Sir William Carington, second son of the second Baron, was a soldier, politician and courtier.

The Barons Carrington are related to the Barons Bicester. The first Baron Carrington&#x27;s younger brother John Smith was the great-grandfather of Vivian Smith, who was created Baron Bicester in 1938. Also, Abel Smith, MP, father of the first Baron Carrington, was the brother of George Smith, who was created a baronet in 1757 (see Bromley baronets), and of John Smith, great-grandfather of the first and last Baron Pauncefote.

The family seat is The Manor House, near Bledlow, Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="475520" wikidata="Q1277193" url="?curid=475520" title="Earl Weaver">
<text>Earl Sidney Weaver (August 14, 1930 – January 19, 2013) was an American professional baseball manager, author, and television broadcaster. After playing in minor league baseball, he retired without playing in Major League Baseball (MLB). He became a minor league manager, and then managed in MLB for 17 years with the Baltimore Orioles (1968–1982; 1985–86), winning a World Series championship in 1970. Weaver&#x27;s style of managing was summed up in the quote: &quot;pitching, defense, and the three-run homer.&quot; He did not believe in placing emphasis on &quot;small ball&quot; tactics such as stolen bases, hit and run plays, or sacrifice bunts. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Playing career==
He was the son of Earl Milton Weaver, a dry cleaner who cleaned the uniforms of the St. Louis Cardinals and Browns, and Ethel Genevieve Wakefield. Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer, who pitched under Weaver for 14 seasons in the major leagues, wrote that his manager was &quot;brought up in St. Louis on the bad side of a street where even the good side isn&#x27;t too good.&quot;

After playing for Beaumont High School in his hometown, St. Louis, Missouri, the St. Louis Cardinals signed the 17-year-old Weaver in 1948 as a second baseman. A slick fielder but never much of a hitter, he worked his way up to the Texas League Houston Buffaloes (two steps below the majors) in 1951, though never made it to the big league club. Weaver was later traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, then moved on to the Orioles, where he began his managing career.

Palmer once noted: &quot;The only thing that Earl knows about a curve ball is he couldn&#x27;t hit it.&quot;

==Managerial career==
Weaver started his minor league managerial career in 1956 with the unaffiliated Knoxville Smokies in the South Atlantic League. He joined the Orioles in 1957 as manager of their Fitzgerald, Georgia, club in the Georgia–Florida League. The Orioles moved him up to their franchise in Dublin, Georgia, in 1958, and to their Aberdeen, South Dakota, club in 1959. In 1960, he managed the Fox Cities Foxes in Wisconsin in the Class-B Three-I League. He advanced to the AA Elmira Pioneers in 1962 and to the AAA Rochester Red Wings in 1966.

As a minor league manager, he compiled a record of 841 wins and 697 defeats (.547) with three championships in 11½ seasons. Weaver was appointed to replace Gene Woodling as the Orioles&#x27; first-base coach on October 3, 1967, and spent the first half of the 1968 season in that capacity before succeeding Hank Bauer as manager on July 11. His contract was for one year; he would continue to work under one-year contracts throughout his tenure with the team.
During his tenure as major league manager, the Orioles won the American League pennant in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1979, each time winning 100 games. Weaver was the first manager since Billy Southworth 
(1942–44) to win 100 games in three straight seasons.

In 1969, the Orioles were defeated in the World Series in five games by the New York Mets team known as the Miracle Mets. He was ejected in Game 4 of that series by umpire Shag Crawford for arguing balls and strikes. In 1970, the Orioles won the World Series by defeating the Cincinnati Reds (The &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;) in five games. In 1971, the Orioles lost the World Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pirates pitcher Steve Blass pitched a complete game and gave up four hits in the deciding seventh game, allowing the Orioles to score only one run.

Weaver loved scoring with three-run home runs, &quot;a great plan if you have Boog Powells and Frank Robinsons and Brooks Robinsons,&quot; according to Palmer. The 1974 Orioles were not hitting as many home runs, yet Weaver insisted on continuing to use the strategy. With the team eight games behind the Red Sox in late August, the Orioles held a secret player&#x27;s-only meeting at Paul Blair&#x27;s house. Their new strategy, according to Palmer, was &quot;Squeeze every hit and every base and every run you can out of every play.&quot; To accomplish this goal, the players came up with secret signs they would use in games. The new strategy worked, as Baltimore overcame the deficit to clinch the division at the end of the year. According to Brooks Robinson, &quot;It took Earl about three or four games to finally figure out what the heck we were doing in that situation, and I think he ended up saying, &#x27;Well, you&#x27;d better be right.&#x27;...It worked out well. And Earl loved us all, anyway.&quot;

Weaver&#x27;s 1,000th MLB career victory as manager was a 5–3 Opening Day result over the Chicago White Sox at Memorial Stadium on April 6, 1979. That year, the Orioles, which saw Weaver use 140 different lineups during the regular season, would reach the World Series again, this time losing in seven games to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He expressed plans to retire following the 1982 season prior to Game 6 of that World Series on October 16. He had originally targeted the expiration of his contract upon the conclusion of the 1980 campaign to step away from the sport.

In 1982, Weaver announced he would retire at the end of the season. After Palmer posted a 6.84 ERA in five starts, GM Hank Peters announced that &quot;Palmer is never, ever, ever going to start another game in an Orioles uniform. I&#x27;ve had it.&quot; Weaver moved Palmer to the bullpen, but with the team needing another starter, he put Palmer back in the rotation in June. Shortly thereafter, Palmer went on an 11-game winning streak. The Orioles played poorly for the first half of the year before climbing in the standings to just three games behind going into a season-ending four-game series against the division-leading Brewers at Memorial Stadium. The Orioles beat them handily in the first three games to pull into a first-place tie. The final game of the series, and the season, on October 3, would decide the AL East title. Televised nationally on ABC, the Orioles suffered a crushing 10–2 loss. After the game, the crowd called for Weaver to come out. This tribute to the retiring Weaver provided intense emotion against the backdrop of the season-ending defeat, as Weaver, in tears, stood on the field and applauded back to the fans, and shared words and an embrace with Brewers manager Harvey Kuenn. On TV, broadcaster Howard Cosell captured the moment: &quot;Thee Er-uhl of Bal-tee-more. They love...troo-lee love...this man, Er-uhl Weeev-ver! A man &quot;of&quot; the people. The Weeeve! One &quot;of&quot; a kind. A baseball gar-rate!&quot; Joe Altobelli was appointed his successor one month later on November 12, 1982.

The year following Weaver&#x27;s retirement, Baltimore won the World Series. Palmer wrote, &quot;We won with a team Earl put together.&quot; Owner Edward Bennett Williams coaxed Weaver out of retirement midway through the 1985 season, but he retired for good after the 1986 season, the only full losing season of his major league career. Weaver&#x27;s managerial record is 1,480–1,060 (.583), including 100+ win seasons in 1969 (109), 1970 (108), 1971 (101), 1979 (102), and 1980 (100). Weaver had a record average 94.3 wins per season.

In 1989, Weaver managed the Gold Coast Suns in the new Senior Professional Baseball Association. Less than a week into the season, Weaver was ejected from his first game. He later commented, &quot;These umpires are high school rejects. The league went for the cheapest umpiring association. There should be no league if this continues.&quot; The Suns failed to make the playoffs in the 1989–90 season and folded after one season.

===Disciplinary actions===
Weaver never got along well with umpires. Palmer described their relationship: &quot;Earl Weaver hated umpires with every fiber of his win-or-die being. He yelled at them. He screamed in their faces. He kicked dirt on them. He tore up rule books. He taunted and tortured them.&quot; Weaver was ejected from games at least 91 times during the regular season (98, according to one source) and several more times during post-season play. He was ejected from both games in a doubleheader three times. He was twice ejected from games before they even started, both times by Ron Luciano. Luciano alone ejected him from all four games of a minor-league series and eight games in the majors. Sometimes, even after Weaver had been thrown out of a game, he would phone the Oriole dugout to tell the coaches what moves to make.

He also received four multiple-game suspensions. He was well known for the humor that often accompanied his ejections. During one particular tirade with an umpire, Weaver headed to the dugout screaming, &quot;I&#x27;m going to check the rule-book on that&quot; to which the umpire replied, &quot;Here, use mine.&quot; Weaver shot back, &quot;That&#x27;s no good—I can&#x27;t read Braille.&quot; He once told an umpire that he could appear on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; wearing his mask, chest protector, holding his ball/strike indicator and still nobody would guess he was an umpire.

Weaver had a penchant for kicking dirt on umpires, and for turning his cap backwards whenever he sparred with umpires in order to get as close to them as possible without actually touching them. His rivalry with Luciano was legendary, to the point where the AL rearranged umpiring schedules for an entire year so that Luciano would not work Orioles games. A year later on August 26, 1979, in the third inning of the opener of an Orioles-White Sox doubleheader at Comiskey Park, he ejected Weaver who then publicly questioned Luciano&#x27;s &quot;integrity&quot; and received a three-game suspension. Weaver once derisively called Luciano &quot;one of the few umpires that people have paid their way into the park to see.&quot;

Marty Springstead was one of Weaver&#x27;s least favorite umpires. On September 15, 1977, in Toronto, Weaver asked Springstead to have a tarpaulin covering the Toronto Blue Jays bullpen area removed; the tarp was weighted down by bricks and Earl argued his left fielder could be injured if he ran into the bricks while chasing a foul ball. When the umpire refused to order the Blue Jays to move the tarp, Weaver pulled the Orioles off the field. The umpire declared a forfeit, the only forfeit in Orioles history. On another infamous occasion, in Cleveland, Weaver stormed to the dugout and returned to the field with a rulebook in his pocket. &quot;Don&#x27;t take that book out or you&#x27;re outta here,&quot; Springstead warned. Weaver pulled it out anyway and was ejected. After that game, Weaver said of Springstead, &quot;He&#x27;s a terrific guy...He&#x27;s just not a very good umpire.&quot;

One of Weaver&#x27;s most infamous tirades came on September 17, 1980, in a game against the Detroit Tigers. First base umpire Bill Haller, who was wearing a microphone for a documentary on the daily life of an MLB umpire, called a balk on Oriole pitcher Mike Flanagan. Weaver charged out of the dugout and began screaming at Haller, who was already angry at Weaver for publicly questioning his integrity by suggesting he be prohibited from working Tigers games in 1972 because his brother was the Tigers&#x27; backup catcher at the time. After Weaver was ejected, he launched into a profanity-filled argument in which he accused Haller of blatantly calling the game out of the Orioles&#x27; favor. He also accused Haller of poking him in the chest, and after Haller denied doing so they called each other liars. Weaver&#x27;s contempt for umpires was often mutual. One night in 1973 Weaver threw his cap to the ground and began a vehement argument with Luciano. Luciano&#x27;s crew-mate Don Denkinger walked over to Weaver&#x27;s cap, stepped on it with the sharp cleats of both shoes, and slowly twisted back and forth.

===Philosophy===

Weaver&#x27;s oft-quoted managerial philosophy was &quot;pitching, defense, and the three-run homer.&quot; Weaver expanded on his philosophy in three books he authored: &quot;Winning!&quot; (1972); &quot;It&#x27;s What You Learn After You Know It All That Counts&quot; (1983); and &quot;Weaver on Strategy&quot; (1984), which was republished as &quot;Weaver on Strategy: The Classic Work on the Art of Managing a Baseball Team&quot; (2002, with co-author Terry Pluto). Weaver eschewed the use of so-called &quot;inside baseball&quot; or &quot;small ball&quot; tactics such as the stolen base, the hit and run, or the sacrifice bunt, preferring a patient approach (&quot;waiting for the home run&quot;), saying &quot;If you play for one run, that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll get&quot; and &quot;On offense, your most precious possessions are your 27 outs&quot;. Weaver claims to have never had a sign for the hit and run, citing the play makes both the baserunner and the hitter vulnerable, as the baserunner is susceptible to being caught stealing and the hitter is required to swing at any pitch thrown no matter how far outside the strike zone it may be or how unhittable the pitch is.

Weaver strongly believed in finishing as high in the standings as possible, even if a championship was not involved: In 1977, the Orioles entered the final weekend of the season tied for second place in the AL East with the Red Sox, three games behind the division-leading Yankees, to play a scheduled three-game series against the Red Sox in Boston, while the Yankees played three at home against Detroit. The Red Sox won the first game of the series, 11–10, on September 30, eliminating the Orioles from division title contention; however, after the game Weaver insisted, in an interview with a reporter, that &quot;we&#x27;re still trying to finish second.&quot; The following day, the Orioles won, 8–7, eliminating the Red Sox (the Yankees having lost on both days) and leaving the teams tied for second place headed into the series&#x27; and the season&#x27;s final game, which was rained out, resulting in the Red Sox and Orioles finishing in a tie for second place. Weaver also insisted his players maintained a professional appearance at all times. He allowed mustaches, but not beards, and, as a rule, players had to wear a suit or jacket and tie on board an airplane for a road trip. Weaver &quot;was fiercely loyal to his players,&quot; said Palmer, who recalled that in 1976 the manager took his side when he was negotiating for a raise with the Orioles&#x27; owners. &quot;He just never got to know them,&quot; Palmer remembered, observing that the first time Weaver ran into Dennis Martínez after retiring, all he had to say to Martínez was, &quot;How&#x27;s your curveball?&quot; After he became the Orioles&#x27; manager, he hated being referred to as &quot;Coach,&quot; complaining even when players mistakenly referred to him as that out of respect.

====Use of statistics====
Weaver made extensive use of statistics to create matchups which were more favorable either for his batter or his pitcher. He had various notebooks with all sorts of splits and head-to-head numbers for his batters and against his pitchers and would assemble his lineups according to the matchups he had. For example, despite the fact Gold Glove Award shortstop Mark Belanger was a weak hitter, in 19 plate appearances he hit .625 with a .684 on-base percentage and .625 slugging percentage against Jim Kern and would be slotted high in the lineup when facing him. Similarly, Boog Powell, the 1970 American League MVP, hit a meager .178/.211/.278 against Mickey Lolich over 96 plate appearances and would be substituted, possibly with a hitter like Chico Salmon, who hit a much more acceptable .300/.349/.400 against the same pitcher. Palmer said, &quot;Earl scribbled stats, piles and piles of figures and percentages on everybody and everything. All those sheets with all those numbers made him a better manager.&quot;

In 1984, Weaver was credited by sportscaster Craig Sager, then of CNN, with being the first major league manager to have used computerized statistical records as part of his decision-making process.

====Use of the bench====
In the Orioles teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Weaver made frequent use of platoons, with the most obvious example being the use of Gary Roenicke and John Lowenstein in left field, without affordable full-time solutions. Weaver also exploited a loophole in the designated hitter rule by listing as the DH one of his starting pitchers who would not be appearing in that day&#x27;s game, who would then be substituted before their first at-bat. This gave him another opportunity to exploit pitcher-batter matchups, in the case the opposing starting pitcher left the game early because of injury or ineffectiveness before it was the DH&#x27;s turn in the batting order. A rule was created to stop the use of this tactic, allegedly (by Weaver) because it was distorting pinch-hitting statistics.

Weaver used radar guns to track the speed of pitched balls during the 1975 spring training season.

====Lack of knowledge about pitching====
Palmer said, &quot;I learned a lot from Earl Weaver. The first thing I learned was that he didn&#x27;t know a thing about pitching.&quot; Dave McNally agreed: &quot;The only thing Earl Weaver knows about pitching is that he can&#x27;t hit it.&quot; Weaver was a fan of sliders for some reason. Mike Flanagan figured out that Weaver got less angry when pitchers gave up hits on sliders than when they gave up hits on other pitches. &quot;Every hit after that, I told him it was off a slider,&quot; Flanagan said. While Palmer was pitching for Rochester for 1967, with the bases loaded against the Buffalo Bisons and Johnny Bench coming up to bat, Weaver came out to the mound and told Palmer, &quot;Throw him a fastball down the middle.&quot; Palmer complied, and Bench hit a grand slam. Palmer did, however, credit Weaver&#x27;s ability to recognize good pitchers. &quot;He could spot them, trade for them, stick with them. He might have driven them crazy, but he knew which ones to drive crazy.&quot; &quot;I always said I gave Mike Cuellar more chances than I gave my first wife,&quot; Weaver maintained.

===Managerial record===

==Broadcasting career==
===ABC===
Between his stints as manager, Weaver served as a color commentator for ABC television, calling the 1983 World Series (which the Orioles won) along with Al Michaels and Howard Cosell. Weaver was the lead ABC color commentator in 1983 (replacing Don Drysdale, who moved over to secondary play-by-play for ABC) but was also employed by the Baltimore Orioles as a consultant. At the time, ABC had a policy preventing an announcer who was employed by a team from working games involving that team. So, whenever the Orioles were on the primary ABC game, Weaver worked the backup game. This policy forced Weaver to resign from the Orioles consulting position in October so that he can work the World Series for ABC. Weaver later called the 1984 National League Championship Series (between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs) for ABC alongside fellow hall of famers Reggie Jackson, who played for Weaver in 1976, and Don Drysdale.

===&quot;Manager&#x27;s Corner&quot;===
While managing the Orioles, Weaver hosted a radio show called &quot;Manager&#x27;s Corner&quot; with Baltimore Oriole play by play announcer Tom Marr in which he would give his views on baseball and answer questions from fans. Weaver and Marr once recorded a prank version of the program, giving hilarious off-color answers to queries ranging from Terry Crowley, &quot;team speed&quot; and even growing tomatoes (Weaver and groundskeeper Pat Santarone had a friendly rivalry on this topic, and the latter had a fenced off tomato patch in left field foul territory at Memorial Stadium.). The tape, which was not broadcast at the time, has since become legendary in Baltimore sports circles and has even been aired (in heavily edited fashion) on local sports radio.

==In media==
Weaver wrote three books: &quot;Winning!&quot; (1972), &quot;Weaver on Strategy&quot; (1984), and &quot;It&#x27;s What You Learn After You Know It All That Counts&quot; (1983).

In 1987, Weaver assisted in the development of the AI for the computer game &quot;Earl Weaver Baseball&quot;, which was published by Electronic Arts. The game was one of the precursors of the EA Sports line.

==Death==
Weaver died about 2 a.m. on January 19, 2013, of an apparent heart attack while on an Orioles&#x27; fantasy cruise aboard the &quot;Celebrity Silhouette&quot; in the Caribbean Sea. According to the &quot;Silhouette&quot;″s itinerary, the ship had left Labadee, Haiti, on January 18 and was expected to dock at Fort Lauderdale, Florida on January 20, 2013. Weaver&#x27;s wife of 49 years, Marianna, was at his side when he died. He was 82 years old. By coincidence, another Baseball Hall of Fame member, the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Stan Musial, died later that day.

Upon Weaver&#x27;s death, Bud Selig, then-commissioner of Major League Baseball, released the following statement: &quot;Earl Weaver was a brilliant baseball man, a true tactician in the dugout and one of the key figures in the rich history of the Baltimore Orioles, the club he led to four American League pennants and the 1970 World Series championship ... Having known Earl throughout my entire career in the game, I have many fond memories of the Orioles and the Brewers squaring off as American League East rivals. Earl&#x27;s managerial style proved visionary, as many people in the game adopted his strategy and techniques years later. Earl was well known for being one of the game&#x27;s most colorful characters with a memorable wit, but he was also amongst its most loyal. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I send my deepest condolences to his wife, Marianna, their family and all Orioles fans.&quot;

Orioles managing partner Peter Angelos added: &quot;Earl Weaver stands alone as the greatest manager in the history of the Orioles organization and one of the greatest in the history of baseball ... This is a sad day for everyone who knew him and for all Orioles fans. Earl made his passion for the Orioles known both on and off the field. On behalf of the Orioles, I extend my condolences to his wife, Marianna, and to his family.&quot;

His remains were cremated.

<text>Martin Austin Deasy (26 August 1936 – 10 June 2017) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Agriculture from 1982 to 1987. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Waterford constituency from 1977 to 2002. He was a Senator from 1973 to 1977, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Early life==
Deasy was born in Dungarvan, County Waterford in August 1936. He was educated at Dungarvan CBS, before studying at University College Cork. He qualified as a secondary school teacher in 1963. Immediately after graduating, Deasy joined the teaching staff of St. Augustine&#x27;s College in Dungarvan.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Deasy was elected as a Fine Gael member of both Dungarvan Urban District Council and Waterford County Council in 1967, positions he held until 1983. He was chairman of the latter body from 1980 to 1981, before reclaiming his seat on the Urban District Council from 1994 to 1999. Deasy was also a member of the South East Health Board, Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Waterford Vocational Education Committee.

He contested the 1969 general election, as a Fine Gael candidate for Waterford. However, he finished fifth in the three-seat constituency. Deasy finished in fifth position again when he stood as a candidate in the same constituency at the 1973 general election.

Deasy was selected as a candidate for the Cultural and Educational Panel for the subsequent election to Seanad Éireann in 1973. However, he was once again unsuccessful. In spite of this, he was appointed to the Seanad as one of Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave&#x27;s nominees.

===TD===
Deasy contested his third general election in 1977. He was successful in being elected that time, taking the third seat in the newly expanded constituency and finishing ahead of his running mate Edward Collins. Fine Gael returned to opposition following that election, however, Deasy was immediately appointed to the Front Bench as Spokesperson for Fisheries. In a 1979 reshuffle, he became Spokesperson for Transport, Communications and Technology, a position he held until early 1981, when he ceded the Communications and Technology elements of his brief.

Following the formation of a Fine Gael-Labour coalition government in 1981, Deasy was one of several Front Bench spokespersons who were unlucky not to be appointed to cabinet or as a Minister of State.

The collapse of the coalition government in 1982, saw Deasy return to Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s Front Bench as Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.

The formation of a new Fine Gael-Labour coalition in 1982, saw Deasy being appointed as Minister for Agriculture. During his four-year tenure in the position he was seen as an effective Minister.

In 1988, Deasy resigned from the Fine Gael Party, in protest against Alan Dukes&#x27; Tallaght Strategy, in which Fine Gael would support the minority Fianna Fáil government on budgetary related issues. The following year Deasy tried unsuccessfully to remove Dukes as leader. Deasy called the agreement treacherous and said he could support any party who expressed confidence in Fianna Fáil or Charles Haughey. This was widely seen as the actual opinion of a majority of Fine Gael TD&#x27;s and Senators. When the agreement had broken between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, Deasy agreed to return to Fine Gael. Upon his return in 1991, he was appointed to the front bench, after John Bruton became leader. Deasy later resigned again due to the financial difficulties the party was facing. In 2000, Deasy introduced an unsuccessful motion of no confidence in Bruton.

Deasy was succeeded as TD by his son, John Deasy.

==Personal life and death==
In 1961 Deasy married Kathleen Keating, and they had four children. After a short illness, Deasy died at University Hospital Waterford on 10 June 2017, at the age of 80.

<text>Baron Dinevor, of Dinevor in the County of Carmarthen (usually spelt Dynevor or Dinefwr), is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created on 17 October 1780 for William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot, with remainder to his daughter, Lady Cecil, wife of George Rice, a member of a prominent Welsh family. On Lord Talbot&#x27;s death the earldom became extinct because he left no sons to succeed to it, while the barony of Talbot also held by him was inherited by his nephew. The barony of Dynevor passed according to the special remainder to his daughter, the second holder of the title. In 1787 Lady Dynevor (Cecil Rice) assumed by Royal licence the surname of de Cardonnel in lieu of Rice.

Her son, the third Baron, George Talbot Rice, represented Carmarthen in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. In 1793 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of de Cardonnel, but in 1817 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Rice. George Talbot Rice (Talbot-Rice) was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Carmarthen. In 1824, on inheriting the estates of the Trevor family of Glynde in Sussex, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Trevor.

He was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the second son of the Very Reverend the Hon. Edward Rice, second son of the second Baroness. His grandson, the seventh Baron, represented Brighton in Parliament as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. In 1916 he assumed by Royal licence for himself and his issue the surname of Rhys in lieu of Rice. His son, the eighth Baron, was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Romford and Guildford. the title is held by his grandson, the tenth Baron, who succeeded in 2008.

The Rhys and Talbot Rice (Talbot-Rice) family can claim descent from the fifteenth century Rhys ap Thomas who had been granted extensive lands throughout west Wales as a reward for his leading role in the campaign that led to Henry VII&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. He or his men may even have delivered the fatal blow to Richard III.

<text>New Carlisle () is a town in the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region of Quebec, Canada. It best known as the boyhood home of René Lévesque although he was born in Campbellton, New Brunswick. Its population is approximately 1,336, approximately two thirds of whom are anglophone and the remainder francophone. New Carlisle is located on the Baie des Chaleurs.

New Carlisle is the seat of Bonaventure Regional County Municipality, the judicial district of Bonaventure, and the regional base for the Ministry of Transports Quebec, which has an operations centre on the outskirts of town. New Carlisle has a post office, primary and high schools, five different churches, and many other services. Via Rail mothballed its operations between Matapédia and New Carlisle sometime around 2010.

==History==

Originally a Mi&#x27;kmaq site called &quot;Antagoetjoitog&quot;, meaning &quot;at the Black&#x27;s&quot;, the site of the town was selected in 1784 by the Lieutenant-Governor of the jurisdictional District of Gaspe, Nicholas Cox. The town as is thought to have been named after Cox&#x27;s home town, possibly Carlisle, England. Soon after the name was changed from &quot;Carlisle&quot; to &quot;New Carlisle&quot;. The original settlers of 1784 were discharged soldiers of British Army regiments and Loyalists claimants. In 1842, the geographic Cox Township was proclaimed. It was also known as Petit-Paspébiac in the 19th century.

The area was first incorporated as the Township Municipality of Cox in 1845, dissolved in 1847, but reestablished again in 1855. On February 1, 1877, the Township Municipality of Cox was dissolved and divided into the Municipalities of New Carlisle and Paspébiac.

The town was the scene of the capture of the German spy Werner von Janowski, who was dropped from a nearby U-boat in November 1942.

<text>Desmond FitzGerald (born Thomas Joseph FitzGerald;13 February 1888 – 9 April 1947) was an Irish revolutionary, politician, and poet, known for his role in the Irish independence movement and for his ministerial roles in Irish governments; he was Director of Publicity from 1919 to 1921, Minister for Publicity from 1921 to 1922, Minister for External Affairs from 1922 to 1927 and finally Minister for Defence from 1927 to 1932. Born in London to an Irish family, FitzGerald moved to Paris in his early twenties, where he became involved in the Imagist group of poets. In 1913, FitzGerald returned to Ireland and the next year became active in the Irish Volunteers, a paramilitary organisation that sought Irish independence from Britain. FitzGerald partook in the Easter Rising of 1916 in Dublin and was subsequently imprisoned for two years by the British.

FitzGerald was elected as a Sinn Féin MP in 1918, leading to his release from custody. During the Irish War of Independence FitzGerald worked as the rebels&#x27; Minister for Publicity. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, he supported the pro-Treaty side, leading to his involvement in the Irish Civil War as a member of the Free State government. He served as Minister for External Affairs from 1922 to 1927, during which he worked to establish the international presence of the newly formed Irish Free State on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedhael political party. His presence in Irish politics greatly lessened after his party&#x27;s defeat in the 1932 Irish general election. By the end of the 1930s, he pivoted his career towards academics. 

His son, Garret FitzGerald, would later become Taoiseach.

==Early life==
Desmond FitzGerald was born Thomas Joseph FitzGerald in Forest Gate in West Ham, Essex in 1888. His parents were Patrick Fitzgerald (1831–1908), a labourer from south Tipperary, and Mary Anne Scollard (1847–1927) from Castleisland, County Kerry. He changed his first name as a teenager to the more romantic &quot;Desmond&quot;, and first visited Ireland in 1910. He was a student at St Bonaventure&#x27;s.

In London, he was a member of the Tour Eiffel group of poets and writers, which included Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, F. S. Flint and another Irish writer, Joseph Campbell. The group was named after the restaurant in which the group met, the Tour Eiffel in Soho. In April 1908, FitzGerald and Florence Farr introduced Ezra Pound to the Tour Eiffel group, a meeting out of which the Imagist group was later to emerge.

==Marriage and family==
In 1911 FitzGerald, a Catholic, married Mabel Washington McConnell (1884–1958), a daughter of John McConnell, a whiskey salesman from Belfast, and granddaughter of a Presbyterian farmer near the city. Educated at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, she shared FitzGerald&#x27;s interest in the Irish language; she met him in London at a language seminar. They lived in France until moving to County Kerry in March 1913. During this period he became involved with the Imagist group of poets. They had four children: Desmond (1911–1987), Pierce (1914–1986), Fergus (1920–1983) and Garret (1926–2011).

==Irish nationalist==
FitzGerald joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and organised a Volunteers group in County Kerry. As an organizer he was expected to drill even the most unsuited recruits. This offended his disciplined morality. The organization was under enormous pressure: many leaders were expelled in July 1915 under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. FitzGerald took the place of Ernest Blythe. In 1915 FitzGerald was imprisoned for making a speech against recruitment during the First World War. He was later expelled from Kerry, and moved to County Wicklow. FitzGerald&#x27;s abstemious, parsimonious character, backed up by a long Anglo-Norman family history, made him an unpopular figure in the movement. He felt his bosses were unaware of his situation. 

===Easter Rising===
During the occupation of the General Post Office during the 1916 Rising, he commented &quot;I was bemused by the general attitude of security&quot;. At the height of the battle he was in the midst of the conflagration that shook the GPO garrison. Ever the sceptic, FitzGerald, who was in charge of rations, mentions in his memoir of the 1916 Rising the sudden and unexpected mobilisation, followed by a description of conditions in the GPO, the rebels&#x27; headquarters. While many accounts describe the Rising as a form of blood sacrifice, FitzGerald discussed its wider rationale with the leader Patrick Pearse, and with Joseph Plunkett who had travelled to Germany in 1915 for assistance. They expected that Germany would win the First World War, and that a rising of at least three days would allow Ireland to take a seat at the peace conference. Though declaring an Irish Republic in 1916, they considered it would probably be necessary to invite the Kaiser&#x27;s youngest son Joachim to reign over a reformed kingdom of Ireland after the war, where Irish was to again become the everyday language.

===Revolutionary period===
FitzGerald was released in 1918 when he was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for the Dublin Pembroke constituency. Following the assembly of the First Dáil in 1919, and the declaration of the Irish Republic, he was appointed Director of Publicity for Dáil Éireann, first joining the paper &quot;Nationality&quot; in May to replace the arrested Laurence Ginnell. FitzGerald remarked in the first report he made to the Dáil that &#x27;our chief means of publicity was by means of publicity&#x27;. He struggled to make an impression on the British press, who supplied most of Ireland&#x27;s foreign news.

In May 1919, Erskine Childers, FitzGerald&#x27;s friend and colleague, went to Versailles intending to be part of the Peace Conference. Childers became increasingly frustrated by the high-handed British attitude towards Irish independence. FitzGerald started a mimeograph entitled &quot;Weekly Summary of Acts of Aggression by the Enemy&quot; in July 1919. By November he had joined with Childers to produce the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;. For twenty-two months they publicized the crimes of England, with the purpose of bolstering the Dáil&#x27;s credibility with Sinn Féin. Despite the Dáil&#x27;s complaint in 1920 that the lists were &quot;inadequate&quot;, the momentum behind the Propaganda Department threw their opponents into confusion. 

During the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) the &quot;Bulletin&quot; managed to publicise the aims of the Irish Republic to the wider world with increasing success, and removed the likelihood of the conflict being widened. In devising a strategy to retain Ulster, leading republican Ernest Blythe believed a blockade would be disastrous for Belfast. Conversely, Seán MacEntee demanded a response to what he considered to be a war of extermination against nationalism; there was, he argued, &quot;the potent weapon of blockade&quot;. Many leading republicans were firmly against it: FitzGerald declared a blockade would be tantamount &quot;to a vote for partition&quot;. The Dáil&#x27;s department seemed to be winning the propaganda war with the Castle, whose operations could not convince the public. The Secretariat was convinced the &quot;Bulletin&quot; should continue, when its papers and materials were seized in a raid. FitzGerald was arrested in March 1921, but was released. In late August 1921 Éamon de Valera reshuffled his Cabinet, in which FitzGerald was not included; although in replacing Childers he was named Minister of Publicity. He was one of the TDs who were unsuccessful in persuading de Valera to join the negotiators of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that was signed on 6 December.

==Government minister==
FitzGerald supported the Treaty. On 30 August 1922, he was designated the Minister for External Affairs of the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland. On the date he was appointed, Southern Ireland was still part of the UK; only because the administration was a transitional one did it have a Minister for External Affairs. The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922.

FitzGerald, by letter dated 17 April 1923, applied on behalf of the Irish Free State for membership of the League of Nations. Ireland was admitted to membership the following year. FitzGerald also represented the new state at the Imperial Conferences. In 1927 FitzGerald became Minister for Defence. 

==Latter years in politics==
Following the defeat of the government in 1932 Irish general election, FitzGerald&#x27;s interest in politics began to wane, although he continued to be involved. In 1933, following the merger of Cumann na nGaedhael, the National Centre Party and the Army Comrades Association (Blueshirts), FitzGerald became a member of the ACA. FitzGerald attempted to add &quot;intellectual substance&quot; to the organisation and was one of the members of the Oireachtas who wore their uniform into the Chambers before doing so was outlawed by the new Fianna Fáil government. 

The 1930s saw FitzGerald radicalised by world events, and FitzGerald began to take the view that in a showdown between the forces of Fascism and Communism occurred, he would choose Fascism. FitzGerald supported Franco&#x27;s nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, and, for a time, was supportive of Hitler&#x27;s Germany. In private, FitzGerald began to indulge in anti-Semitic impulses, although he never did so publicly. 

FitzGerald lost his seat in the 1937 Irish general election but was thereafter elected to Seanad Éireann, where he remained until retiring from politics in 1943 following a bad loss in the 1943 Irish general election where he placed 9th. Some historians attribute FitzGerald&#x27;s 1937 loss to the fact he had pulled away from his constituency to begin work as a lecturer in the philosophy of politics at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. This position only lasted a year but lead to FitzGerald switching his attention to writing the book &quot;Preface to Statecraft&quot; (1939).

==Final years==
FitzGerald spent some of the World War II period in Stratford, England managing his brother France&#x27;s chemical Factory following France&#x27;s death in 1941. 

==Personal life==
One of his sons, Garret FitzGerald, likewise served as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the 1970s and Taoiseach on two occasions in the 1980s.

Desmond FitzGerald died of a heart attack on 9 April 1947 in Dublin, aged 59.

<text>Brooks Calbert Robinson Jr. (May 18, 1937 – September 26, 2023) was an American baseball player who played his entire 23-year career in Major League Baseball as a third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles from 1955 to 1977. Nicknamed &quot;Mr. Hoover&quot; and &quot;the Human Vacuum Cleaner&quot;, he is generally considered to have been the greatest defensive third baseman in major league history. An 18-time All-Star, he won 16 consecutive Gold Glove Awards, the most by a position player, and tied with Jim Kaat for the second-most of all time, behind Greg Maddux. His 2,870 career games at third base not only exceeded the closest player by nearly 700 games when he retired, but also remain the most games by any player in major league history at a single position. His 23 seasons spent with a single team set a major league record since matched only by Carl Yastrzemski.

Joining the Orioles as a teenager in 1955, Robinson became the centerpiece of the team as they posted the best record in the major leagues between 1965 and 1974, capturing four American League (AL) pennants and two World Series titles. Beloved in Baltimore, Robinson was known as &quot;Mr. Oriole&quot; by the team&#x27;s fans. He was named the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1964 after posting career highs with a .317 batting average, 28 home runs, and 118 runs batted in (RBIs), leading the AL in the last category. In 1966, he finished second in the MVP voting behind teammate Frank Robinson after again posting 100 RBIs as the Orioles won the pennant, before sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers for the team&#x27;s first Series title.

In the 1970 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Robinson drew wide attention with his strong defensive play, time after time robbing Cincinnati players of base hits, and drove in runs in the first four games; his performance won him the World Series MVP Award as Baltimore defeated the Reds in five games. In 1971 he became one of just 12 players to earn over $100,000 annually. Robinson led AL third basemen in fielding percentage eleven times and in assists eight times, both major league records, and in putouts and double plays three times each. He still holds major league records for career putouts (2,697), assists (6,205), total chances (9,165), and double plays (618) at third base, with each total being between 13% and 20% higher than the closest player. His career fielding percentage of .971 was a major league record until 2006, and remains the top AL mark.

Upon his retirement during the 1977 season, his 2,896 games and 10,654 at bats each ranked fifth in major league history, behind only Ty Cobb among AL players, and his 2,848 hits ranked seventh in AL history. From 1969 to 1980, he held the AL record for career home runs by a third baseman. He set franchise records for career games, at bats, hits, runs (1,232), RBIs (1,357), doubles (482), total bases (4,270), and home runs by a right-handed hitter (268), all of which were later broken by Cal Ripken Jr. Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983 in his first year of eligibility, a first for third basemen. Following his playing career, he served as a broadcaster for the Orioles and also joined Opening Day Partners, who own several minor league teams. Robinson remained popular with Oriole fans for his kindness and patience with them. &quot;Never has a player meant more to a franchise and more to a city than Brooks has meant to the Orioles and the city of Baltimore,&quot; said Oriole historian Ted Patterson.

==Early life==
Brooks Calbert Robinson was born on May 18, 1937, in Little Rock, Arkansas, to Brooks Calbert Sr. and Ethel Mae (née Denker) Robinson. His father worked for Colonial Bakery in Little Rock and later became a captain with the Little Rock Fire Department. Meanwhile, his mother worked for Sears Roebuck &amp; Company before accepting a position with the state controller&#x27;s office. Young Robinson drew a salary himself from delivering the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; on his bicycle, as well as operating the scoreboard and selling soft drinks at Lamar Porter Field.

Robinson Sr. played second base for a semi-pro baseball team. He would play the game with his son during Robinson&#x27;s younger years. Growing up, Robinson rooted for the St. Louis Cardinals; Stan Musial was his favorite player. In high school, he played American Legion Baseball for the M. M. Eberts Post No. 1 Doughboys, among the greatest American Legion teams in that part of the country. The team reached the regional finals in 1952, when Robinson was 15. They then advanced to the sectional tournament in 1953. Robinson graduated from Little Rock Central High School on May 27, 1955, impressing the University of Arkansas enough with his basketball ability that the school offered him a full scholarship. However, Robinson desired to become a professional baseball player. Lindsay Deal, who went to Capitol View Methodist Church with Robinson, had been a teammate of Baltimore Orioles manager Paul Richards on a minor league team, and he wrote a letter to Richards praising Robinson&#x27;s ability. &quot;He&#x27;s no speed demon, but neither is he a truck horse,&quot; Deal wrote. &quot;Brooks has a lot of power, baseball savvy, and is always cool when the chips are down.&quot; In 1955, three major league teams sent scouts to Little Rock to try to sign Robinson: the New York Giants, the Cincinnati Redlegs, and the Orioles. Each offered $4,000, but only Cincinnati and Baltimore were offering major league contracts. Robinson ultimately chose to sign with Baltimore because the Orioles had shown the most interest and had the most opportunities for young players to become everyday players on their roster. Art Ehlers was the scout who signed him.

==Baltimore Orioles==
===Early years (1955–1959)===
Playing second base, Brooks Robinson made his professional debut on June 3, 1955, at Bob Hoffman Stadium with the York White Roses. After three months in York, Pennsylvania, he made his first appearance with the Orioles on September 17, 1955, at Memorial Stadium against the Washington Senators, batting sixth in the lineup. He had two hits in four at bats, singling in the fourth inning against Chuck Stobbs for his first hit before driving in a run on a single in the eighth inning in a 3–1 win. After that, he went hitless in his next 18 at bats before sitting for the season&#x27;s final two games. &quot;Those American League pitchers made me look like just what I was—a young, green, immature eighteen-year-old who&#x27;d been lucky that first day against Washington,&quot; he later reflected. After the season, the Orioles assigned him to the Willard Blues, a Colombian winter league team where Baltimore sent some of its best prospects. Earl Wilson hit Robinson in the head with a pitch in one of the games, but Robinson was protected from severe injury because of a new fiberglass batting helmet the team was testing on their players.
In 1956, Robinson was allowed to stay in spring training with the Orioles until March 21, but Baltimore acquired Bobby Adams to play third base, thinking the 18-year-old Robinson was not quite ready for the major leagues. He spent most of the year with the Class AA San Antonio Missions, where he tore cartilage in his right knee while sliding into a base in August. The injury was initially feared to require surgery, but rest and heat reduced the swelling, and he missed only a few games. Promoted to Baltimore after the minor league season, he appeared in 15 games, demonstrating fielding ability beyond his years, though only batting .227.

Robinson competed with future Hall of Famer George Kell to be Baltimore&#x27;s everyday third baseman in 1957, though Kell happily mentored the younger player. Both made the starting lineup (Robinson at third base, Kell at first), but two weeks into the season, Robinson completely tore the cartilage in his knee while swerving to avoid a tag at first base. He missed all of May and spent most of June on a rehab assignment in San Antonio but regained the starting job when he returned. On August 2, he was again hit in the head with a pitch, this time by Ned Garver. The errant throw resulted in a mild concussion and a wound above Robinson&#x27;s left eye that required 10 stitches, but after five days, the ballplayer was ready to perform again. On August 14, he hit his first major league home run off Pedro Ramos. In 50 games, he batted .239. Because of the time he had missed, the Orioles had him play winter baseball again to continue his development. This time in Havana, he led the league with nine home runs.

When the Orioles played the New York Yankees in late April 1958, Yogi Berra said that Robinson &quot;got a great future&quot; after the third baseman dove to catch a Gil McDougald ground ball, stood up, and threw out Berra trying to score. Offensively, Robinson batted .406 through April. Toward midseason, he developed a hitch in his swing and started hitting too many pop flies, which caused him to lose playing time to Dick Williams in August. He helped Hoyt Wilhelm throw a no-hitter on September 28 by making three terrific fielding plays after replacing Williams at third base in the eighth inning. &quot;There weren&#x27;t too many bright spots in my 1958 season, but being in on Wilhelm&#x27;s no-hitter was the big one for me,&quot; Robinson recalled. In 145 games, he batted .238 with three home runs in 463 at bats---weak offensive numbers, but his defense was more impressive. &quot;I think Brooks is in a class by himself as a defensive third baseman,&quot; said Oriole manager Paul Richards.

Following the 1958 season, Robinson enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard for four years; he served six months on active duty, then three and a half years in reserve status, which ensured he would not be drafted for two years of continuous active duty. He qualified as a repair parts specialist in the Ordnance Corps and was assigned to Company A, 739th Ordnance Battalion. Robinson received his honorable discharge in January 1962. Army training kept him physically fit, but not in optimal condition for baseball, and shortly after the 1959 season started, Robinson was sent to the Vancouver Mounties of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. On May 17, he had a terrifying moment when, as he fell into a Capilano Stadium dugout to catch a ball, he caught his right biceps on a hook, tearing tendons and causing severe bleeding; team trainer Doc Younker assisted Robinson in getting him loose from the hook and to the hospital. The injury just missed tearing a nerve, which would have ended his career, but he had to miss only 25 games. Fulfilling a promise he made when he demoted Robinson, Richards recalled him before the season&#x27;s first All-Star Game. The time in the minors had helped his hitting; biographer Doug Wilson wrote that &quot;He was no longer overmatched by big league pitchers.&quot; He batted .284 in 88 games, and Richards said that he was &quot;the best player in the American League [for] the last five weeks of the season.&quot;

===Everyday player, MVP (1960–1965)===

By 1960, Robinson was unquestionably the Oriole third baseman. He started the year in the sixth slot in the batting lineup but ascended to third after batting .333 in June and .351 in July. In July, he was selected to his first of 18 straight All-Star Games; he would be a part of both games from 1960 to 1962, in which two games a year were played. On July 15, he recorded five hits in five at bats, becoming the first Oriole to hit for the cycle in a 5–2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. For the first time since their arrival in Baltimore, the Orioles were contenders for the AL pennant, part of a three-way race with the Yankees and the White Sox as September arrived. In the first game of an early September series against the Yankees in Baltimore, Robinson had the first RBI, then fielded a ball hit off of Milt Pappas&#x27;s leg in the ninth and threw out Héctor López at first base. He drove in the only runs in the second game, in which the Orioles took over first place in the AL on September 3. Baltimore swept the series, but a fever briefly hospitalized Robinson at the end of the series, and he went into a batting slump. After getting swept in a four-game series against New York later in the month, Baltimore finished in second. In 152 games, Robinson batted .294 and hit 14 home runs. He finished third in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting (behind Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle), was named the Most Valuable Oriole by sportscasters and sportswriters around Baltimore, and won his first of 16 consecutive Gold Glove Awards at third base.

For most of 1961, Robinson batted first in Baltimore&#x27;s lineup. He further solidified his defensive reputation in 1961; sportswriter Bob Addie reported, &quot;The &#x27;young old-timers&#x27; in the press box are beginning to compare Baltimore&#x27;s Brooks Robinson with the great third basemen of the past.&quot; One of two players in the AL to appear in every game of the season, he batted .287 with 192 hits (second in the league only to Norm Cash&#x27;s 193) and seven home runs.

After two straight second-place finishes, the Orioles slumped to seventh place in the league in 1962, but Robinson had another fine year. In consecutive games on May 6 and 9, Robinson hit a grand slam, one of six major leaguers ever to have done so at the time. In August, he had eight straight hits over a three-game span. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; proclaimed him &quot;the best third baseman in the league.&quot; He batted higher than .300 for the first time (.303) and topped 20 home runs (23), recording 86 RBIs as he was named the Most Valuable Oriole for the second time. Robinson got off to an excellent start offensively to the 1963 season, and had hits in both of his at bats in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game. Overall, his offensive production diminished, as he batted just .219 after the All-Star break, and saw a streak of 462 consecutive games played come to an end when manager Billy Hitchcock benched him in an attempt to improve his hitting. For the year, he batted .251 with 11 home runs and 67 RBI.

Robinson spent extra time in 1964 spring training practicing offense with hitting coach Gene Woodling. The coach encouraged Robinson to stop swinging at bad pitches, and Robinson started using a slightly heavier bat. Against the Yankees early in the year, he made what Wilson said &quot;was generally agreed to be the play of the year,&quot; diving to stop a hard-hit ground ball off the bat of Bobby Richardson and throwing him out while still seated on the ground. With the Orioles, Yankees, and White Sox in a three-way race for the pennant, Robinson batted .464 with 28 RBIs from September 7 through the end of the season, though the Orioles again finished behind the Yankees. The Orioles honored him with a &quot;Brooks Robinson Night&quot; late in the season, which the ballplayer said &quot;will always remain one of the great moments of my life.&quot; Maxwell Kates of the Society for American Baseball Research said &quot;Robinson had perhaps his best season in 1964.&quot; Playing all but two innings of Baltimore&#x27;s 163-game season, Robinson hit for a .317 batting average with 28 home runs. He led the league with 118 RBI, winning the AL MVP Award. For much of 1965, Robinson batted over .300 again, though his average fell to .297 by the end of the year. He led Baltimore in batting average and RBIs (80).

===World Series champion (1966–1971)===
====1966–1970====
During the 1965–66 offseason, the Orioles acquired former National League (NL) MVP Frank Robinson from the Cincinnati Reds; Frank would bat third in the lineup, right in front of Brooks. Halfway through the year, Brooks had 70 RBIs. In the All-Star Game, played in conditions, he made several outstanding defensive plays and recorded three hits, and was the game&#x27;s MVP even though the AL lost 2–1. Over 28 games in August, he struggled, batting .187 with just three RBIs. The Orioles nonetheless won the AL pennant for the first time in Robinson&#x27;s tenure with the team, clinching on Sep 15. In 157 games, Robinson batted .269 with 23 home runs and 100 RBIs, his second and final season with at least 100 RBIs. He finished second to Frank, that year&#x27;s Triple Crown winner, in the AL MVP voting; teammate Boog Powell came in third.

Against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, Frank and Brooks hit back-to-back home runs off of Don Drysdale in Game 1, a 5–2 victory. &quot;Drysdale&#x27;s second pitch to me was a high fast ball, and I parked it in almost the same seats in the left field pavilion [that Frank had hit his to],&quot; Robinson recalled. In Game 4, the Orioles nursed a 1–0 lead in the fifth inning when Jim Lefebvre led off with a single. The next batter, Wes Parker, hit a ground ball that Robinson had to stretch to catch. After stumbling, Robinson threw the ball to second baseman Davey Johnson, who threw out Parker at first base to complete a double play. The score remained 1–0 through the end of the game, and the Orioles completed a four-game sweep of the Dodgers for Baltimore&#x27;s first World Series championship. A picture of Robinson leaping into the air as he ran to the pitcher&#x27;s mound to congratulate Dave McNally after the game remains one of the most iconic Oriole photos. After the season, he and multiple other baseball celebrities went on a tour to visit US troops serving in the Vietnam War.

In 1967 spring training, Phil Niekro hit Robinson in the head with a pitch, causing a mild concussion. Robinson slumped early in the year but improved toward the end of June, posting 17 hits over 39 at bats in one 10-game stretch, including five home runs. His home run in the All-Star Game was the only run for the AL in a 2–1, 15-inning loss. On August 6, he hit into a triple play for the fourth time in his career, a major league record. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing someone erase my record of hitting into four triple plays,&quot; he said. Toward the end of the year, he went hitless in 49 of 51 at bats. In 158 games, he batted .269 with 22 home runs and 77 RBIs. He played all 162 games for the Orioles in 1968, batting .253 with 17 home runs and 75 RBIs. Robinson also ended the season with 405 assists, tying the major league record set by Harlond Clift in 1937; Graig Nettles broke the record with 412 assists in 1971.

Through May 1969, Robinson batted .216, only raising his average to .234 by the end of the year. Manager Earl Weaver attributed his struggles to swinging at bad pitches, as well as his slow pace, which prevented him from getting as many infield hits. On May 28 in a 9–5 road win against the Seattle Pilots, he hit his 179th career home run as a third baseman, breaking Clift&#x27;s AL record. Robinson hit .234 with 23 home runs and 84 RBI, and the Orioles won the newly created AL East division to advance to the postseason.

In Game 1 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) versus the Minnesota Twins, Robinson had four hits in Baltimore&#x27;s 4–3 win. He gloved a hard-hit line drive off the bat of Rod Carew in Game 3, an 11–2 victory that clinched the Orioles a trip to the World Series to face the New York Mets. During the first game of the World Series, Rod Gaspar hit a slow, bouncer toward third that both Gaspar and pitcher Mike Cuellar thought would be a hit; Robinson caught it barehanded and threw to first before he had fully stood up, retiring Gaspar as the Orioles went on to win 4–1. He made a similar play to keep Jerry Grote from getting a hit in Game 2 and had an RBI single against Jerry Koosman, but Baltimore lost 2–1. With the Orioles trailing the Mets 1–0 in the ninth inning of Game 4, Robinson batted against Tom Seaver with runners on first and third and one out. He sent the ball towards right field but was robbed of a hit when Ron Swoboda made a diving catch; Biographer Doug Wilson, mentioned earlier in this article, wrote that the catch &quot;is one of the all-time great plays in World Series history.&quot; Baltimore lost 2–1 in 10 innings, then went on to lose the series in five games.

Robinson started using a heavier bat in 1970, as he batted .311 in April. On May 9, he hit his 200th home run. His 2,000th hit came on June 20, a three-run home run that provided the margin of victory in a game against the Washington Senators. Against the Boston Red Sox on September 4, he recorded five hits, two home runs, and four RBIs in an 8–6 victory. On September 8 in a 6–3 road win against the Detroit Tigers, he broke Eddie Yost&#x27;s American League record of 2,008 games at third base. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators on September 29, he had his 1,000th career RBIs against Joe Coleman, who had also allowed his 200th home run. Robinson had his highest batting average (.276) and RBIs (94) totals since 1966, adding 18 home runs as the Orioles again won the AL East.

====1970 postseason====
In the ALCS, against the Twins, Robinson batted .583 with three runs scored and two RBIs as Baltimore completed the sweep, sending them to the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. With Game 1 of the World Series tied at 3–3 in the sixth inning, Lee May hit a one-hop ball fair past third. Playing behind the base, Robinson lunged, backhanded the ball, spun 180 degrees, and made a one-hop toss to first that narrowly beat May to the bag. Years later, Jayson Stark of ESPN considered this the third-greatest play of all time. Against Gary Nolan in the seventh inning, Robinson&#x27;s solo home run provided the winning margin in Baltimore&#x27;s 4–3 triumph. As it turned out, these were just the first of many fine plays Robinson would make during the Series.

During Game 2, Robinson darted into the gap between him and shortstop Mark Belanger to field a ground ball hit by Bobby Tolan in the first inning. Throwing sidearm to second, he forced out Pete Rose. Then, in the third inning, he snagged a hard line drive off May&#x27;s bat, whirling and throwing almost immediately to second for a double play that ended the inning. Baltimore won the game 6–5. Robinson made an over-the-head catch of a bouncing ball off of Tony Pérez&#x27;s bat in the first inning of Game 3, outracing Rose to third base and throwing to first to complete a double play. Fielding a slow grounder hit by Tommy Helms in the second inning, Robinson partially circled the ball before picking it up, allowing him to throw to first on a better angle. He dove to his left to rob Johnny Bench of a hit in the sixth inning, barely holding onto a hard line drive. Offensively, he had two RBIs in Baltimore&#x27;s 9–3 win. In Game 4, he had four hits and a home run, though Baltimore lost 6–5. Finally, in Game 5, he made a diving back-handed catch of a line drive off of Bench&#x27;s bat in the ninth, and fielded Pat Corrales&#x27; ground ball for the final out, as Baltimore won the game 9–3 to clinch their second World Series victory.

Though Robinson batted .429 with two home runs in the series, his defensive prowess was what really stood out, as he started two double plays and fielded 23 chances while making several outstanding plays. His performance won him the World Series MVP Award. During the Series, Reds manager Sparky Anderson quipped, &quot;I&#x27;m beginning to see Brooks in my sleep. If I dropped this paper plate, he&#x27;d pick it up on one hop and throw me out at first.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like him in my life,&quot; Rose said. &quot;He has to be the greatest third baseman of all time,&quot; said Pérez, who played the same position. &quot;I just enjoy watching him play. He&#x27;s in the right place every time.&quot; Wilson wrote that Robinson&#x27;s outstanding play in the series, which was televised nationally, helped his ability to be appreciated by baseball fans outside the Baltimore area. After the season, he won the Hickok Belt, presented annually to the top professional athlete of the year.

====1971====
Before the 1971 season, Robinson signed a $100,000 contract, becoming only one of 12 players with such a high baseball salary at the time. He played 50 games in a row without committing an error and received the most votes of AL players in the All-Star Game. On July 28, he uncharacteristically made three errors in a game, though Baltimore still won 3–2. Wilson pointed out, &quot;men had literally walked on the moon before Brooks Robinson had made three errors in a game.&quot; On the final day of the season, he broke Eddie Mathews&#x27; major league record of 2,181 games at third base, with his 2nd-inning home run providing the only scoring in a 1–0 victory over the Red Sox. In 156 games, he batted .272, hitting 20 home runs and driving in 92 runs as he finished fourth in AL MVP voting.

For the third year in a row, the Orioles won the AL East. In Game 2 of the ALCS against the Athletics, Robinson hit a home run against Catfish Hunter. He had two RBIs in Game 3 and batted .364 in the series as Baltimore swept the Athletics, advancing them to the World Series where they would face the Pittsburgh Pirates. In Game 2, Robinson had three RBIs and reached base safely five times, joining Babe Ruth and Lou Brock as the only other players to do so in a World Series game. During the eighth inning, he landed on his chest after diving for a bouncing ball off the bat of Manny Sanguillén, but he stood up in time to throw the runner out. Baltimore won 11–3. After the Pirates got two baserunners in the first inning of Game 3, Robinson snagged a hard line drive off the bat of Bob Robertson, throwing to second for a double play. Baltimore would lose that game 5–1. With the Orioles facing elimination in Game 6, Robinson hit a 10th-inning sacrifice fly against Bob Miller that scored the winning run in a 3–2 victory. He batted .318 in the series and tied with other Orioles and Pirates for the most RBIs in the series (five), but Pittsburgh defeated the Orioles in seven games.

===Later years (1972–1977)===
Robinson served as the Major League Baseball Players Association player&#x27;s representative for much of his career with the Orioles. In 1972, he and Belanger were among the 47 who voted in favor of the 1972 Major League Baseball strike. &quot;I want to play,&quot; Robinson told reporters. &quot;All players do. It all boils down to whether the owners are willing to make some concessions. I think our fellows are willing to make some, too, and that seems to be the best chance.&quot; The strike only wound up cancelling games on 10 days of the 1972 season, but Robinson was booed in his first at bat of the year at Memorial Stadium.

In 153 games in 1972, Robinson batted .250. His eight home runs and 64 RBIs were his lowest totals in those categories since 1961. During the season, he criticized Weaver publicly when Weaver suggested that some of the Oriole veterans were getting too old to play. &quot;I find the remark embarrassing,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;I don&#x27;t enjoy going places to hear people say I&#x27;m over the hill, or know that they&#x27;re thinking it.&quot; He recognized that Weaver was a great manager, however, and observed a couple years later that &quot;Rarely have I questioned his action.&quot; Robinson still won the Commissioner&#x27;s Award, presented annually to the individual who best represented baseball as a player and as a person.
Robinson hit two home runs on Opening Day in 1973, but his batting average was under .200 by the middle of June. He still made the All-Star Game, but sportswriters observed that his selection had more to do with popularity than it did with his performance that season. On May 4, he had his 2,417th career hit, breaking Pie Traynor&#x27;s record for most hits by a third baseman. Defensively, he started two 5–4–3 triple plays – on July 7 against the Athletics, and on September 20 against the Tigers. On August 20, he got his 2,500th hit against the Twins, a 9th-inning RBI single to tie the game, with the Orioles going on to win 4–3. In the season&#x27;s final months, he batted nearly .300. He played 155 games, batting .257 with nine home runs and 72 RBIs as the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. In the ALCS against Oakland, he batted .250 with a run scored and two RBIs as the Athletics defeated Baltimore in five games.

Though Robinson made more errors than usual in 1974, he was batting .311 at the All-Star break. In the second-to-last game of the year, Robinson scored from first on a pinch-hit double by Andy Etchebarren. The run provided the margin of victory in a game that, coupled with a Yankee loss later that day, clinched the Orioles&#x27; AL East championship. Robinson batted .288 with seven home runs. His batting average was the best it had been since 1965, though his RBIs were his lowest since 1959. Oriole historian Ted Patterson wrote that 1974 was &quot;his last solid season.&quot; The Orioles again faced the Athletics in the ALCS; in Game 1, Robinson dove to catch a ball hit by Dick Green, then threw him out at first, adding a solo home run in Baltimore&#x27;s 6–1 win. He would bat just .083 in the series, which Oakland won in four games.

Plagued by a sore thumb and declining ability in 1975, Robinson missed the All-Star Game for the first time since 1960. His batting average was .159 at one point, and on July 7, a pinch-hitter was substituted for him for the first time since 1958. In 144 games, he batted .201 with six home runs and 53 RBI. On the bright side, he led AL third basemen in fielding percentage for the 11th time.

The Orioles had a young third base prospect named Doug DeCinces, and on May 17, 1976, Weaver informed Robinson that DeCinces would be taking over his position; though still a fine fielder, Robinson was only batting .165. Robinson requested a trade to a team that would give him more playing time and was nearly sent to the White Sox, but he vetoed the deal because Chicago did not want to give him a contract through 1978. In 71 games, he batted .211 with three home runs and 11 RBI.

1977 would be his final season; his playing time was infrequent. &quot;Brooks&#x27; last great moment,&quot; according to Patterson, came against the Indians on April 19, when he pinch-hit in the bottom of the 10th inning of a game against the Indians which Baltimore trailed 5–3. There were two men on base, and after working the count full and fouling off several pitches, Robinson hit a walkoff home run against Dave LaRoche for a 6–5 Oriole win. He made his final batting appearance on August 5 at Anaheim Stadium, pinch hitting for Belanger in the top of the eighth inning and lining out. However, he would play briefly in one more game, eight days later at Memorial Stadium against the Athletics. He entered as a pinch hitter for Al Bumbry against the left-handed Bob Lacey. When Oakland manager Bobby Winkles replaced Lacey with right-hander Doug Bair, Weaver replaced Robinson with left-handed Tony Muser before the at bat even started. With the Orioles needing another roster spot when Rick Dempsey returned from the disabled list, Robinson announced his retirement as an active player on August 21, with more than a month to go in the season. He was given a standing ovation by the fans at Metropolitan Stadium prior to that afternoon&#x27;s 9–5 loss to the Minnesota Twins. He was honored a month later with an hour-long ceremony before a 10–4 defeat to the Boston Red Sox on September 18 before a crowd of 51,798, then the largest attendance for an Orioles home regular-season game.

Robinson batted .267 in his 23-year career, accumulating 2,848 hits, 268 home runs, and 1,357 RBI. In 39 postseason games, he batted .303 with 5 home runs and 22 RBI. Defensively, Robinson set an AL record by leading the league in fielding percentage for 11 seasons. His career fielding percentage of .971 was higher than that of any other third baseman when he retired. Other third baseman&#x27;s records he holds include most games played at the position (2,870), most putouts (2,697), most assists (6,205), most total chances (9,165), and most double plays (618).

Prior to Robinson, no other player in Major League history had spent as many as 23 seasons exclusively with one ballclub; the only player to do so since is Carl Yastrzemski. Robinson reached 18 straight All-Star Games (1960–74) and participated in the World Series four times. His AL record of 266 career home runs as a third baseman was broken by Graig Nettles in 1980.

==Player profile==
Robinson was very animated while waiting to hit. He would grab the top of his helmet, swing his bat with his left hand, and rock forwards and backwards before pitches. Though he was not a fast baserunner, he would swing his arms as he ran the bases, emphasizing the fact that he was running as fast as he could. As a hitter, Robinson&#x27;s trademark was his custom-made batting helmet with a 1-inch bill that was much shorter than the standard. He would use a hacksaw blade to shorten the bill to keep it from distracting him at the plate.

His strong defensive play caused him to be nicknamed the &quot;Human Vacuum Cleaner&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hoover,&quot; as he was so skilled at catching balls hit towards third base. As a fielder, he was always on the move, not typical for third basemen of the time. His arm did not appear to be one of baseball&#x27;s strongest partly because he was so quick at letting go of the ball. Instead of cocking his arm back before throwing, he would transfer the ball from his glove to his hand and fire it &quot;in one seamless motion,&quot; according to Wilson. He had a knack for knowing which play to make, and he was well known for running towards the plate to field bunts or other slow ground balls. &quot;He didn&#x27;t have a typical athletic body, he was kind of slump-shouldered, not a real muscular guy, and he didn&#x27;t appear to have a strong arm,&quot; said teammate Chuck Estrada. &quot;But then watching him play, you found out that none of that mattered, because he had great hands, a quick release, and the runner was always out.&quot; Robinson&#x27;s 16 Gold Glove awards at third base are tied with pitcher Jim Kaat for the second most won by any player, behind only pitching great Greg Maddux&#x27;s 18.

Jim Murray of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote during Robinson&#x27;s career that &quot;In the future, Brooks Robinson will be the standard every third baseman will be measured by&quot;; writing 40 years later, Wilson said &quot;That statement has withstood the test of time.&quot; Casey Stengel and Home Run Baker, each of whom was involved in the game of baseball for over 50 years, both agreed that Robinson was the greatest third baseman they ever witnessed. Harold &#x27;Pie&#x27; Traynor, the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; hall of fame third baseman to whom Robinson was often compared, said, &quot;I once thought of giving him some tips, but dropped the idea. He&#x27;s just the best there is.&quot; Umpire Ed Hurley said, &quot;He came down from a higher league.&quot;

Robinson was very particular about his glove. He would try the gloves of different players and trade two of his own for theirs if he really wanted it. Once he found one he liked, he would take a year to prepare it. When he felt it was ready for game action, he would use it exclusively during games, using others for batting practice and infield workouts. He was also picky about his bat, though he would use different ones from game to game, sampling those of his teammates and even opposing players before he found one he wanted to utilize.

Aside from his playing ability, Robinson endeared himself to the Orioles fans because of his personality. &quot;Other stars had fans,&quot; goes a quote in Patterson&#x27;s book. &quot;Robby made friends.&quot; He treated them with patience and kindness while taking an interest in them as well. “When fans ask Brooks Robinson for his autograph,” commented Oriole broadcaster Chuck Thompson, “he complied while finding out how many kids you have, what your dad does, where you live, how old you are, and if you have a dog. ... His only failing is that when the game ended, if Brooks belonged to its story – usually he did – you better leave the booth at the end of the eighth inning. ... By the time the press got [to the clubhouse] Brooks was in the parking lot signing autographs on his way home.&quot; &quot;Never has a player meant more to a franchise and more to a city than Brooks has meant to the Orioles and the city of Baltimore,&quot; wrote Patterson.

==Off-the-field occupations, post-retirement==
In 1961, Robinson became the part owner of Brooks and Eddie Robinson&#x27;s Gorsuch House restaurant, located near Memorial Stadium. He started Brooks Robinson Sporting Goods in 1963; the company did a great deal of wholesale business with Baltimore-area teams. By the 1970s, they had established multiple locations in the Baltimore area. They briefly supplied uniforms for the Orioles, then later outfitted the short-lived Baltimore Claws of the American Basketball Association. In 1974, the company took out a loan to expand to York, Pennsylvania, but delays in construction of the new store ran the company into debt, forcing it to cease operations shortly thereafter. A judge ordered Robinson&#x27;s house to be sold in the fall of 1976 to pay the company&#x27;s debt, but Robinson managed to keep the house by paying nearly $180,000 out of his personal savings. He became a spokesman for Crown Central Petroleum in 1968 and spent over 30 years working for them. After the sporting goods business failed, Robinson and Ron Shapiro founded Personal Management Associates, which managed money for athletes.

Following his retirement as a player, Brooks began serving as a color commentator for the Orioles&#x27; television broadcasts, travelling to around 50 road games for the Orioles and calling 10 home games as well. On March 1, 1982, WMAR-TV, the station that broadcast the Orioles games in Baltimore, was struck by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). All of the station&#x27;s on-air talent, except one, went on strike. AFTRA and WMAR negotiated for several weeks without success, but when Robinson refused to cross the picket line at the start of the baseball season, the strike ended the next day. He continued to serve as a broadcaster until 1993, when he decided to spend more time focusing on his business pursuits. In 1982, Robinson helped found the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, an organization that helps retired players secure benefits, promotes youth baseball, raises money for charity, and helps retired players maintain contact with each other. He succeeded Jim Kaat as president of the organization in 1989, and remained president until February 2023, shortly before his death. He was succeeded by Jim Thome. The MLBPAA&#x27;s Brooks Robinson Community Service Award is named in his honor.

Robinson became a part owner of Opening Day Partners, an organization which owns several minor league teams, in 2005. The group owns four teams in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, and Robinson played a significant role in establishing the York Revolution. Founded in York, Pennsylvania, in 2007, the team was York&#x27;s first since 1969; Robinson himself had played minor league ball for the York White Roses in 1955. The team&#x27;s stadium, WellSpan Park, is located at 5 Brooks Robinson Way, and the plaza at its entrance is named in his honor. In the 1980s and again in 2006, Robinson helped raise money to restore Lamar Porter Field in his hometown of Little Rock, where he had played baseball while growing up.

In 2015, Robinson auctioned off a slew of items from his career, including his 1970 Gold Glove and his 1966 World Series ring. The auction raised $1.44 million for the Constance &amp; Brooks Robinson Charitable Foundation.

==Honors==

Robinson&#x27;s jersey number (5) was retired by the Orioles on April 14, 1978. In 1983, Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, one of 16 players to have been honored on the first ballot since the inaugural class of 1936. Coincidentally, Kell got in the same year. &quot;It was unbelievable that two kids raised just 90 miles apart, and with the same churchgoing backgrounds and the same ideals, would go into the Hall of Fame the same day,&quot; Kell said. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t write the script any better.&quot;

Brooks and Frank were the first members of the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 1977, and Brooks was selected to the Arkansas Hall of Fame the following year. Robinson and former Baltimore Colts football player Johnny Unitas had plaques in their honor in the lobby of Memorial Stadium. When the Orioles played their last game there on October 6, 1991, Robinson and Unitas were invited to throw out the ceremonial first pitches. Robinson threw a baseball, while Unitas threw a football. After the game, Robinson led 119 former Oriole players in uniform out onto the field, where they took their old positions.

In 1999, Robinson ranked Number 80 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Fans elected Robinson to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team in 2008; Robinson accumulated the most votes of any player elected. In 2015, Robinson was selected as one of the Orioles Franchise Four, recognizing the four greatest living players in Orioles history, along with Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson, and Cal Ripken Jr. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked him number 73 on the &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list complied sportswriter Joe Posnanski. That same year, he was the National Baseball Hall of Fame Recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award for his service in the Vietnam War.

Robinson has won several awards not specifically for baseball players as well. In 1984, he was presented the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was awarded the Silver Beaver Award by the Boy Scouts of America in 1990. Radio Tower Drive, a road in Pikesville, Maryland, was renamed Brooks Robinson Drive in honor of Robinson&#x27;s 70th birthday on May 16, 2007.

Three statues of Robinson have been created. The first was placed in the Brooks Robinson Plaza outside WellSpan Park in York in 2008. On October 22, 2011, the second was unveiled on Washington Boulevard in downtown Baltimore. This statue depicted Robinson preparing to throw out a runner at first base. Present for the unveiling of the statue, Robinson commented that it &quot;gave him more hair than he deserved.&quot; The Orioles unveiled a larger-than-life bronze sculpture of Robinson at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on September 29, 2012, as part of the Orioles Legends Celebration Series during the 20th anniversary of the ballpark.

==Personal life==

Robinson met his future wife, Constance Louise &quot;Connie&quot; Butcher, on an Orioles team flight from Kansas City to Boston in July 1959, where she was working as a flight attendant for United Airlines. He was so smitten with her that he kept ordering iced teas from her. Some of his teammates encouraged him to go talk to her. After drinking his third glass, he returned it to her in the galley. There he told her: &quot;I want to tell you something. If any of these guys, the Baltimore Orioles, ask you for a date, tell &#x27;em you don&#x27;t date married men. Understand? I&#x27;m the only single guy on the team.&quot; Actually, nearly half of the Orioles were single. Before the plane landed in Boston the two had made a date to go out. The two were married in her hometown of Windsor, Ontario, Canada on October 8, 1960. They resided in Owings Mills, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore. They had four children: Brooks David (b. 1961), Chris (b. 1963), Michael (b. 1964), and Diana (b. 1968).

Raised a Methodist, in 1970 Robinson converted to Catholicism, his wife&#x27;s faith. He was inspired to do so when his son, Brooks David, asked why he always went to a different church than the rest of the family on Sunday mornings. In deciding to convert, Robinson sought the advice of family friend Father Martin Schwalenberg, who taught Robinson about the Catholic faith. &quot;For me, there is still one absolute–Jesus Christ,&quot; Robinson wrote in his 1974 autobiography. &quot;The rest of us are still trying to reach his spiritual perfection, and that&#x27;s the significant goal, no matter what form our worship takes.&quot; He was a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes since early in his baseball career.

One of Robinson&#x27;s biggest hobbies was reading; while he was with the Orioles, he was a part of multiple book clubs. &quot;Books about the Civil War and about World War II especially appeal to me,&quot; he wrote in his 1974 autobiography. He also enjoyed country western music.

===Health issues and death===
Robinson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009, but it was discovered early, he underwent a successful emergency surgery, and his treatments were also successful. In 2010, doctors performed another emergency surgery for a large abdominal operation on Robinson. While recovering from it, he developed an infection on March 31, 2011, and spent nearly a month in the hospital. Even after he was released, further complications with the condition left him weakened the rest of the year.

In January 2012, Robinson attended a charity banquet at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in South Florida. While sitting on the third level of a raised platform on a stage, he leaned backwards, and his chair fell off the platform, resulting in another month-long hospital stay and more rehabilitation. In April 2014, Robinson and his attorneys sought a $9.9 million settlement with the Seminole Tribe of Florida as a result of the accident.

Robinson died from heart disease at home in Owings Mills on September 26, 2023, at age 86.

<text>Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders were the best-known of the pro-Confederate partisan guerrillas (also known as &quot;bushwhackers&quot;) who fought in the American Civil War. Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank.
(Citations needed)

Early in the war Missouri and Kansas were nominally under Union government control and became subject to widespread violence as groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competed for control. The town of Lawrence, Kansas, was a center of anti-slavery sentiment. In August 1863, Quantrill led an attack on the town, killing more than 180 civilians.

The Confederate government, which had granted Quantrill a field commission (Citation needed) under the Partisan Ranger Act, was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces. By 1864 Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements. Others lived on to hold reunions many years later, when the name Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders began to be used. The James brothers formed their own gang and conducted robberies for years as a continuing insurgency in the region.

==Origins==

The Missouri-Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861. The historian Albert Castel wrote:

In February 1861, Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention, which rejected secession by a vote of 89–1. Unionists, led by regular US Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically-powerful Blair family, fought for political and military control across the state against the increasingly pro-secessionist forces, led by Governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate General Sterling Price. By June, open warfare occurred between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy. Guerrilla warfare erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek.

One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson&#x27;s Creek:

By August 1862, with the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Missouri was free of significant regular Confederate troops, but the insurgent violence continued. The most notorious guerrilla force was led by William Clarke Quantrill.

==Methods and legal status==
Quantrill was not the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri, but he rapidly gained the greatest notoriety. He and his men ambushed Union patrols and supply convoys, seized the mail, and occasionally struck towns on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri border. Reflecting the internecine nature of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri, Quantrill directed much of his effort against pro-Union civilians by attempting to drive them from the territory that he operated. Quantrill&#x27;s guerrillas attacked Jayhawkers, Missouri State Militia, and Union troops and relied primarily on ambush and raids.

Under his direction, Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as disguises, co-ordinated and synchronized attacks, planned dispersal after an attack that used preplanned routes and relays of horses, and technical methods such as the use of multiple .36-cal. Colt revolvers for increased firepower and their improved accuracy over the .44-cal.

===Confederate induction===
On 15 August 1862, Quantrill was granted a field commission as a captain in the Confederate army under the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act. Other officers were elected by the men, and Quantrill often referred to himself as a colonel. Despite the legal responsibility assumed by the Confederate government, Quantrill often acted on his own with little concern for his government&#x27;s policy or orders. His most notable operation was the Lawrence massacre, a revenge raid on Lawrence, Kansas, in August 1863.

===Lawrence massacre===

Lawrence was the historic base of operations for abolitionist and Jayhawker organizations. Pro-slavery forces also operated in the area, as both sides tried to gain power to determine whether Kansas would allow slavery. During the period of border warfare (1855–1861), the region became known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; in the press. During the Civil War, Jayhawkers continued their raids into western Missouri, where slavery was concentrated in the area known as Little Dixie along the Missouri River. Robberies, theft, arson, and murders of citizens were committed by both sides.

In August 1863, Union authorities assigned to the so-called District of the Border were frustrated by the hit-and-run tactics of Quantrill&#x27;s guerrillas, particularly the aid provided by Confederate sympathizers in western Missouri border counties. Authorities began imprisoning the female members of the known guerrillas&#x27; families, with the intent of banishing them. The females, some teenagers, were jailed in Kansas City, Missouri, in makeshift jails, including the house on Grand Street in which local artist George Caleb Bingham kept his studio. The Union soldiers enlarged the space on the first floor by removing supporting beams. As a result, the structure collapsed, maiming and killing several women. The deaths of the women outraged the pro-Southern guerrillas, as they were close, familial, relations to Quantrill and his men.

Calling for revenge, Quantrill organized a unified partisan raid on Lawrence although there is evidence that the raid had been planned before the collapse. Co-ordinating across vast distances, small bands of partisans rode across of open prairie to rendezvous on Mount Oread in the early morning hours before the raid. Quantrill&#x27;s men burned a quarter of the town&#x27;s buildings and killed at least 150 men and boys. One of the main targets of the raid, abolitionist U.S. Sen. Jim Lane, escaped by fleeing into corn fields. The Lawrence raid was the most deadly and infamous operation of Missouri&#x27;s Confederate guerrillas.

===Confederate reaction===
The Confederate leadership was appalled by the raid and withdrew even tacit support from the &quot;bushwhackers.&quot; After the raid, Quantrill led his men behind Confederate lines down to Sherman, Texas, where they wintered in 1863–1864. Along the way, they attacked Fort Baxter (Kansas), and ambushed and killed near 100 Union troops in the Battle of Baxter Springs. In Texas, they continued to embarrass the Confederate command by their often-lawless actions.

In Texas in 1864, two of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders, the Calhoun Brothers, were killed in a gunfight with Collin County Sheriff Captain James L. Read. Read was able to escape Quantrill&#x27;s rage after he went into hiding but was lynched by Quantrill&#x27;s supporters in Tyler, Texas on May 18, 1864.

Some Confederate officers appreciated the effectiveness of these irregulars against Union forces, which rarely gained the upper hand over them, especially Quantrill. Among them was General Joseph O. Shelby, who rode south into Mexico with his troops, rather than surrender at the end of the war. His command was remembered as &quot;The Undefeated.&quot;

===John Noland===
Among Quantrill&#x27;s men was an enslaved man, John Noland. John was owned by Francis Asbury Noland. There is no evidence that John was given his freedom before or during war.

In the 1999 film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot;, which depicts a group of fictionalized Missouri bushwhackers, the character Daniel Holt was inspired by Noland.

==Dissolution and aftermath==


In late winter 1863, Quantrill lost his hold over his men. In early 1864, the guerrillas returned from Texas to Missouri in separate bands, none being led by Quantrill.

===Deaths===
Quantrill&#x27;s guerrillas, as a group, did not maintain operations in winters along the border. Quantrill took his men to Cedar Mills, Texas, over winter and offered his services to the Confederacy. Their assignments included attacking teamsters who supplied the Union, repelling Union and Jayhawker raids into northern Texas, warding off Indian attacks, and policing and rounding up deserters roaming in Texas and Oklahoma. The guerrillas were rowdy, undisciplined, and dangerous. Quantrill lost his control of the men in the winter of 1863–1864.

The men split into bands and were commanded by Lieutenants &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson and George M. Todd. The guerrillas returned to Missouri in early 1864, and Quantrill took several of his loyal troops east, towards Kentucky. In Kentucky, pro-Union soldiers and hired killers tracked Quantrill and his men. They were cornered in a barn, where a shootout resulted in Quantrill being injured in the spine and left unable to move. He was arrested, but he reportedly died a week later from his wounds.

Anderson&#x27;s splinter group of guerrillas was assigned to duty in 1864 north of the Missouri River, during the General Sterling Price raid. He was to disrupt Union operations north of the Missouri River and draw Union troops toward his cavalry command. Anderson was reportedly shot dead north of Orrick. His body was dragged through the streets of Richmond, Missouri. His gravemarker is in the old Mormon Pioneer cemetery, in the extreme southwest corner, behind some pine trees and near the road.

Todd&#x27;s splinter group was attached to Major General Sterling Price&#x27;s raid south of the Missouri River. He functioned as a cavalry scout. Todd died after being shot out of his saddle by a Union sniper, north of Independence, Missouri, a day before the Battle of Westport.
Captain William H. &quot;Bill&quot; &quot;Stuart&quot; [Stewart] of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders was shot and killed November 1864 in Howard County Missouri as he tried to rob a Union cattle drover.
Some of the guerrillas continued under the leadership of Archie Clement. He kept a group together after the war and harassed the Missouri state government during 1866. In December 1866, state militiamen killed Clement in Lexington. Several of his men continued as outlaws, emerging in time as the James-Younger Gang. The last survivor of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders died in 1940.

<text>Haplorhini (), the haplorhines (Greek for &quot;simple-nosed&quot;) or the &quot;dry-nosed&quot; primates is a suborder of primates containing the tarsiers and the simians (Simiiformes or anthropoids), as sister of the Strepsirrhini (&quot;moist-nosed&quot;). The name is sometimes spelled Haplorrhini. The simians include catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes, including humans), and the platyrrhines (New World monkeys).

Haplorhini was proposed by Pocock in 1918 when he realized the tarsiers were actually sister to the monkeys rather than the lemurs, also following findings of Hugh Cuming 80 years earlier and Linnaeus 160 years earlier. For Linnaeus, this ensemble of primates constituted a genus &quot;Simia&quot;. For religious reasons, &quot;Homo&quot; constituted its own genus (which has remained).

The extinct omomyids, which are considered to be the most basal haplorhines, are believed to be more closely related to the tarsiers than to other haplorhines. The exact relationship is not yet fully established – Williams, Kay and Kirk (2010) prefer the view that tarsiers and simians share a common ancestor, and that common ancestor shares a common ancestor with the omomyids, citing evidence from analysis by Bajpal et al. in 2008; but they also note two other possibilities – that tarsiers are directly descended from omomyids, with simians being a separate line, or that both simians and tarsiers are descended from omomyids.

Haplorhines share a number of derived features that distinguish them from the strepsirrhine &quot;wet-nosed&quot; primates (whose Greek name means &quot;curved nose&quot;), the other suborder of primates from which they diverged some 63 million years ago. The haplorhines, including tarsiers, have all lost the function of the terminal enzyme that manufactures Vitamin C, while the strepsirrhines, like most other orders of mammals, have retained this enzyme. Genetically, five short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are common to all haplorhines whilst absent in strepsirrhines. The haplorhine upper lip, which has replaced the ancestral rhinarium found in strepsirrhines, is not directly connected to their nose or gum, allowing a large range of facial expressions. Their brain-to-body mass ratio is significantly greater than the strepsirrhines, and their primary sense is vision. Haplorhines have a postorbital plate, unlike the postorbital bar found in strepsirrhines. Most species are diurnal (the exceptions being the tarsiers and the night monkeys).

All anthropoids have a single-chambered uterus; tarsiers have a bicornate uterus like the strepsirrhines. Most species typically have single births, although twins and triplets are common for marmosets and tamarins. Despite similar gestation periods, haplorhine newborns are relatively much larger than strepsirrhine newborns, but have a longer dependence period on their mother. This difference in size and dependence is credited to the increased complexity of their behavior and natural history.

==Etymology==
The taxonomic name Haplorhini derives from the Ancient Greek &#x27; (, &#x27;onefold&#x27;, &#x27;single&#x27;, &#x27;simple&#x27;) and &#x27; ( (genitive ῥινός), &#x27;nose&#x27;). It refers to the lack of a rhinarium or &quot;wet nose&quot;, which is found in many mammals, including strepsirrhine primates.

==Classification and evolution==
Molecular estimates based on mitochondrial genomes suggest Haplorhini and its sister clade, Strepsirrhini, diverged 74 million years ago (mya), but no crown primate fossils are known prior to the beginning of the Eocene, 56 mya. The same molecular analysis suggests the infraorder Tarsiiformes, whose only remaining family is that of the tarsier (Tarsiidae), branched off from the other haplorhines 70 mya. The fossil &quot;Archicebus&quot; may be similar to the most recent common ancestor at this time.

The other major clade within Haplorhini, the simians (or anthropoids), is divided into two parvorders: Platyrrhini (the New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (the Old World monkeys and apes). The New World monkeys split from catarrhines about 35 - 40 mya and have African origin, while the apes (Hominoidea) diverged from Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea) about 25 mya. The available fossil evidence indicates that both the hominoid and cercopithecoid clades originated in Africa.

The following is the listing of the living haplorhine families, and their placement in the Order Primates:
* Order Primates
** Suborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, galagos etc.
** Suborder Haplorhini: tarsiers + monkeys and apes
*** Infraorder Tarsiiformes
**** Family Tarsiidae: tarsiers
*** Infraorder Simiiformes: monkeys and apes
**** Parvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeys
***** Family Callitrichidae: marmosets, tamarins
***** Family Cebidae: capuchins, squirrel monkeys
***** Family Aotidae: night or owl monkeys (douroucoulis)
***** Family Pitheciidae: titis, sakis, uakaris
***** Family Atelidae: howler, spider, and woolly monkeys
**** Parvorder Catarrhini Old World anthropoids
***** Superfamily Cercopithecoidea
****** Family Cercopithecidae: Old World monkeys
***** Superfamily Hominoidea: apes
****** Family Hylobatidae: lesser apes (gibbons)
****** Family Hominidae: great apes

==Uncertain placement of extinct early haplorhines==
The exact placement of early haplorhine families is uncertain owing to limited evidence. The following sets out a possible order put together by Williams, Kay and Kirk in 2010, based on cladograms put together by Seiffert et al. (2005), Marivaux (2006) and Bajpai et al. (2008), and should not be seen as definitive. They do not include Propliopithecoidea as they classify them as early catarrhines. Also included are Archicebidae, the discovery of which was announced by Ni et al. in 2013. (but see notes below regarding placement).
* Order Primates
** Plesiadapiformes
**Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, galagos and their ancestors
**Haplorhini
*** possible stem Haplorrhini - see explanation below
*** Tarsiiformes /Omomyiformes Tarsiers and their ancestors
**** Archicebidae
**** Tarsiidae
*** Anthropoidea/Simiiformes
**** Eosimiidae early anthropoids (or simians)
**** Amphipithecidae
**** Parapithecoidea
**** Proteopithecoidea
**** Oligopithecidae
**** Catarrhini Old World anthropoids
**** Platyrrhini New World monkeys

Sigé et al. (1990) describe &quot;Altiatlasius&quot; as an Omomyiform, but also state that it could be an early anthropoid, with the latter view being supported by Godinot (1994) and Bajpai et al. (2008).

Kay et al. (2004) point out that a case can be made for Amphipithecidae being placed either as adapiformes (i.e. early strepsirrhines) or as early anthropoids, noting in particular that they had a long evolution separate from other groups, and that key parts of their anatomy are missing from the fossil record. They conclude that either possibility is equally plausible.

Kay and Williams (2013, edited by Feagle and Kay), look at possible hypotheses about how oligopiths, parapiths and propliopiths relate to each other and catarrhines and platyrrhines:
- that parapiths and propliopiths are closely related, with their common ancestor being related to oligopiths, and the common ancestor of all three being related to the platyrrhines with extant catarrhines (i.e. cercopithecoidea and hominoidea) being descended from the propliopiths;
- or that parapiths and propliopiths are closely related but their common ancestor is closely related to the platyrrhines and the common ancestor of all three is related to the oligopiths, with extant catarrhines again being descended from the propliopiths; 
- or that propliopiths and oligopiths are closely related, and parapiths are related to the common ancestor of both and the common ancestor of all three is related to the platyrrhines, with cercopithecoidea being descended from the parapiths and hominoidea being descended from propliopiths.
- finally, they also consider the hypothesis that oligopiths are adapiformes (i.e. early strepsirrhines rather than early haplorhines)

Ni et al., in announcing &quot;Archicebus achilles&quot; in 2013 as what they describe as the earliest known primate with such detailed remains, place it somewhat differently to the above as they place Omomyids within Tarsiiformes, with Omomyids and Tarsiidae sharing a common ancestor, and that common ancestor sharing a common Tarsiiform ancestor with the Archicebidae.

Possible stem Haplorrhini are some species which are usually considered to be Strepsirrhini, such as the Notharctidae, and Darwinius.

<text>Baron Digby is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Ireland and once in the Peerage of Great Britain, for members of the same family.

Robert Digby, Governor of King&#x27;s County, was created Baron Digby, of Geashill in the King&#x27;s County, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1620. He was the nephew of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol. Lord Digby&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, and the latter&#x27;s younger brothers, the fourth and fifth Barons, all represented Warwick in Parliament.

The 5th Baron&#x27;s grandson, the 6th Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Malmesbury and for Wells. His younger brother, the 7th Baron, represented Ludgershall and Wells in the House of Commons. In 1765, he was created Baron Digby, of Sherborne in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the male issue of his father. In 1790, Lord Digby was further honoured when he was made Viscount Coleshill and Earl Digby also in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the issue male of his body.

His son, the 2nd Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1808 to 1856. He never married, and on his death in 1856, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the two baronies by his first cousin once removed, the 9th Baron. He was the son of Admiral Sir Henry Digby, son of the Very Reverend the Honourable William Digby, younger brother of the 6th Baron and the first Earl Digby. His son, the 10th Baron, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Dorset. He was succeeded by his son, the 11th Baron. He was Chairman of the Dorset County Council from 1955 to 1964 and Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1952 to 1964. The son, the 12th Baron, also served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1984 to 1999. the titles are held by his son, the 13th Baron, who succeeded in 2018. The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son, Hon. Edward St Vincent Kenelm Digby, who was educated at Eton College and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Two female members of the family have also gained fame. Jane Digby was the sister of the 9th Baron while Hon. Pamela Harriman (née Digby), American Ambassador to France, was the eldest daughter of the 11th Baron and the sister of the 12th Baron. 

The family seat is Minterne House, near Dorchester, Dorset.

<text>The John Rylands Research Institute and Library is a late-Victorian neo-Gothic building on Deansgate in Manchester, England. It is part of the University of Manchester. The library, which opened to the public in 1900, was founded by Enriqueta Augustina Rylands in memory of her husband, John Rylands. It became part of the university in 1972, and now houses the majority of the Special Collections of The University of Manchester Library, the third largest academic library in the United Kingdom.

Special collections built up by both libraries were progressively concentrated in the Deansgate building. The special collections, believed to be among the largest in the United Kingdom, include medieval illuminated manuscripts and examples of early European printing, including a Gutenberg Bible and a Mainz Psalter, the second largest collection of printing by William Caxton, and the most extensive collection of the editions of the Aldine Press of Venice. The Rylands Library Papyrus P52 has a claim to be the earliest extant New Testament text. The library holds personal papers and letters of notable figures, among them the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell and the scientist John Dalton.

The architectural style is primarily neo-Gothic with elements of the Arts and Crafts movement in the ornate and imposing gatehouse, facing Deansgate, which dominates the surrounding streetscape. The library, granted Grade I listed status in 1994, is maintained by the University of Manchester and open for library readers and visitors.

The library is one of the museum, library and archive collections of national and international importance under the Designation Scheme for England. , 152 collections are officially designated.

==History==
Enriqueta Rylands purchased a site on Deansgate for her memorial library in 1889 and commissioned a design from architect Basil Champneys. Mrs Rylands commissioned the Manchester academic Alice Cooke to index the vast library of the 2nd Earl Spencer which she had purchased and another collection of autographs. Mrs Rylands intended the library to be principally theological, and the building, which is a fine example of Victorian Gothic, has the appearance of a church, although the concept was of an Oxford college library on a larger scale. Champneys presented plans to Mrs Rylands within a week of gaining the commission. Thereafter frequent disagreements arose and Mrs Rylands selected decorative elements, window glass and statues against his wishes.

Champneys was given the honour of speaking about the library at a general meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was awarded a Royal Gold Medal in 1912. The library was granted listed building status on 25 January 1952, which was upgraded to Grade I on 6 June 1994.

The core of the library&#x27;s collection was formed around 40,000 books, including many rarities, assembled by George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, which Mrs Rylands purchased from Lord Spencer in 1892 for £210,000. She had begun acquiring books in 1889 and continued to do so throughout her lifetime. Another notable purchase made by Mrs Rylands was that of over 6,000 manuscripts from the &quot;Bibliotheca Lindesiana&quot; of James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford at Haigh Hall in 1901. Quickly and without discussion, Mrs Rylands took them off his hands for £155,000, having made her decision based upon cursory description, as Lord Crawford had never produced a definitive description.

After its inauguration on 6 October 1899 (the wedding anniversary of John Rylands and Enriqueta Tennant), the library opened to readers and visitors on 1 January 1900. At the time of Enriqueta&#x27;s death in 1908, the library held more than 50,000 volumes of exceptional quality. In the following years, thanks to bequests, the library acquired 80,000 works and 3,000 manuscripts, which required the construction of an annex behind the main building.

The John Rylands Library and the Manchester University Library merged in July 1972 and was named the John Rylands University Library of Manchester. Special collections built up by both libraries were progressively concentrated in the Deansgate building.

The building has been extended four times, the first time to designs by Champneys in 1920 after the project was delayed by World War I. The Lady Wolfson Building opened in 1962 on the west side and a third extension, south of the first was built in 1969.
In January 2003, an appeal to renovate the building was launched. Funds were generated from grants from the University of Manchester and Heritage Lottery Fund and donations from members of the public and companies in Manchester. The project, Unlocking the Rylands, demolished the third extension, refurbished parts of the old building and erected a pitched roof over its reinforced concrete roof. Champneys designed a pitched roof but Mrs Rylands was advised that an internal stone vault would reduce the fire risk and it was not built. The £17 million project was completed by summer 2007 and the library reopened on 20 September 2007.

A £7.6m plan to upgrade the library was issued in February 2024 under which Manchester City Council will allow a series of &quot;sensitive adaptations&quot; to update the John Rylands Research Institute and Library. The project &#x27;John Rylands Next Chapter&#x27; is a part of its Imagine2030 vision.
==Location==
By the nineteenth century Manchester was a prosperous industrial town and the demands of cotton manufacturing stimulated the growth of engineering and chemical industries. The town became &#x27;abominably filthy&#x27; and was &#x27;often covered, especially during the winter, with dense fogs ... there is at all times a copious descent of soots and other impurities&#x27;. This, and the overcrowded site, created many design problems for the architect. During the century most textile manufacture moved to newer mills in the surrounding towns while Manchester remained the centre of trading in cotton goods both for the home and foreign markets but pollution from burning coal and gas remained a considerable nuisance.

The site chosen by Mrs Rylands was in a central and fashionable part of the city, but was awkward in shape and orientation and surrounded by tall warehouses, derelict cottages and narrow streets. The position was criticised for its lack of surrounding space and the fact that the valuable manuscript collections were to be housed in &quot;that dirty, uncomfortable city ... [with] not enough light to read by, and the books they already have are wretchedly kept&quot; (written in 1901 about the Crawford MSS.) Mrs Rylands negotiated Deeds of Agreement with her neighbours to fix the heights of future adjacent buildings. The permissible height of the building was fixed at just over 34 feet, but it was suggested that it could be taller at the centre if there was an open area around the edges, at the height of buildings that had been demolished to make way for the construction. Champneys incorporated this suggestion into his design, setting the two towers of the façade twelve feet back from the boundary and keeping the entrance block low, to allow light into the library. He designed the building in a series of tiered steps with an almost flat roof to give a &#x27;liberal concession&#x27; to the neighbours&#x27; &#x27;right to light&#x27;.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The library was built on a rectangular plan and subsequent extensions are to the rear. It was designed to resemble a church in a decorated neo-Gothic style with Arts and Crafts details. It is constructed of Cumbrian sandstone, the interior a delicately shaded &#x27;Shawk&#x27; stone (from Dalston, varying in colour between sand and a range of pinks) and the exterior, dark red Barbary stone from Penrith. built around an internal steel framed structure and brick arched flooring. The red &#x27;Barbary plain&#x27; sandstone, which Champneys believed &#x27;had every chance of proving durable&#x27; for the exterior, was an unusual choice in late Victorian Manchester. It proved relatively successful, as an inspection by Champneys in 1900 revealed little softening by the &#x27;effects of an atmosphere somewhat charged with chemicals&#x27; although, by 1909 some repairs were needed.

The library has a crypt above which the building has two unequal storeys giving the impression of three. The ornate Deansgate façade has an embattled parapet with open-work arcading under which is a central three-bay entrance resembling a monastery gatehouse. Its two-centred arched portal has doorways separated by a trumeau and tall windows on either side. Above the doors are a pair of small canted oriel windows. Surfaces are decorated with lacy blind tracery and finely-detailed carving. The carving includes the &quot;J. R.&quot; monogram, the arms of Rylands, the arms of Rylands&#x27; native town, St Helens, and those of five English, two Scottish and two Irish universities and those of Owens College.
On either side of the entrance portal are square two-storey two-bay wings with plain walls with a string course containing grotesques and large octagonal lanterns. Behind the entrance portal flanked by square towers is the three-light east window of the reading hall. It has reticulated tracery and shafts in a similar style to the parapet. In front of the library are Art Nouveau bronze railings with central double gates and lamp standards.

===Interior===
The main reading room on the first floor, 30 feet above the ground and 12 feet from all four boundaries, was noted for the pleasant contrast between the &#x27;sullen roar&#x27; of Manchester and the &#x27;internal cloister quietude of Rylands&#x27;. It was lit by oriel windows in the reading alcoves supplemented by high clerestory windows along both sides. Embellishments in the reading room include two large stained glass windows with portraits of religious and secular figures, designed by C. E. Kempe; a series of statues in the reading room by Robert Bridgeman and Sons of Lichfield; and bronze work in the art nouveau style by Singer of Frome. The portraits in sculpture (20) and stained glass (40) represent a selection of personages from the intellectual and artistic history of mankind. The western window contains &quot;Theology&quot; from Moses to Schleiermacher; the eastern &quot;Literature and Art&quot; (including philosophy). The portrait statues of John and Enriqueta Rylands in white marble, in the reading room, were sculpted by John Cassidy who also executed the allegorical group of &#x27;Theology, Science and Art&#x27; in the vestibule.

Aside from the main library and reading room with gallery above, the design incorporated Bible and map rooms on the first floor, and conference (lecture) and committee rooms on the ground floor, part of which was intended to be a lending library but never operated as such. A caretaker&#x27;s house was incorporated in the building until it was demolished for the extension of 1969.

===Technology===
Electric lighting was chosen as the cleanest and safest alternative to gas but, as the use of electricity was in its early stages, the supply (110 volts DC) was generated on-site. This took some years to achieve due to the inexperience of contractors, but the library became one of the first public buildings in Manchester to be lit by electricity and continued to generate its own supply until 1950.

Champneys suggested that, in order to protect the books and manuscripts, &#x27;it will be very desirable to keep the air in the interior of the building as clear and free from smoke and chemical matter (both of which are held in the air of Manchester) as may be possible&#x27;. The ground floor was built with numerous air inlets and, although his client felt it would prove impossible to exclude foul air, Champneys installed jute or hessian screens to trap the soot, with water sprays to catch the sulphur and other chemicals, which was a very advanced system for the period. Internal screen doors were employed in the entrance hall to prevent the air being &#x27;fouled by the opening of the outer doors&#x27; with internal swing doors between the circulation areas and the main library to &#x27;preserve the valuable books from injury&#x27;. By 1900 the ventilation system had evolved to include electric fans to draw in air at pavement level through coke screens sprayed with water.

==Collections==
On opening in 1900, the library had 70,000 books and fewer than 100 manuscripts and by 2012, more than 250,000 printed volumes and over one million manuscripts and archival items. The main foundation of the library&#x27;s collections acquired in 1892 was the &quot;Althorp Library&quot; of Lord Spencer regarded as one of the finest library collections in private ownership with 43,000 items - 3,000 of which originate from before 1501. Mrs Rylands paid £210,000 for Spencer&#x27;s collection which included the Aldine Collection and an incunabula collection of 3,000 items. The incunabula included a few block books and the St Christopher block print (southern Germany, 1423) the latter being the earliest dated block print whose date in undisputed. During subsequent years, more than 1,000 more incunabula were added to the collection (from various sources).

Owens College Library received Richard Copley Christie&#x27;s library of over 8,000 volumes including many rare books from the Renaissance period in 1901. It was part of the Victoria University of Manchester library from 1904 and was transferred to the John Rylands Library building after the merger in 1972. In 1901, Mrs Rylands paid £155,000 for more than 6,000 manuscripts owned by James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford of Haigh Hall. The &quot;Bibliotheca Lindesiana&quot; was one of the most impressive private collections in Britain at the time, both for its size and rarity of some of its contents. Walter Llewellyn Bullock bequeathed 5,000 items (notably early Italian imprints) during the 1930s.

Mrs Rylands died in 1908 having bequeathed her private collections and an endowment of £200,000 to enable the library to expand. The funds were used to acquire 180,000 books, 3,000 manuscripts and extend the building. The Librarian, Henry Guppy, invited individuals to deposit their archives for safe keeping in 1921 when there were no county record offices in Lancashire or Cheshire and the library became one of the first to collect historical family records.

The library&#x27;s collections include exquisite medieval illuminated manuscripts, examples of early European printing including a fine paper copy of the Gutenberg Bible and books printed by William Caxton, and personal papers of distinguished historical figures including Elizabeth Gaskell, John Dalton and John Wesley. There is no history of this copy of the Gutenberg Bible before it was acquired by the 2nd Earl Spencer.

The library houses papyrus fragments known as the Rylands Papyri and documents from North Africa. The most notable are the &quot;St John Fragment&quot;, believed to be the oldest extant New Testament text, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, the earliest fragment of the text of the canonical Gospel of John; the earliest fragment of the Septuagint, Papyrus Rylands 458; and Papyrus Rylands 463, a manuscript fragment of the apocryphal Gospel of Mary. Minuscule 702, ε2010 (von Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment. Among the papyri from Oxyrhynchus are a homily about women (Inv R. 55247), part of the Book of Tobit (Apocrypha) (448), and Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 73, relating to the transfer of a slave. The Arabic papyri were catalogued by David Samuel Margoliouth; his catalogue was published in 1933.

In addition to the collections of Spencer, Crawford, Christie and Bullock, holdings have been enriched by gifts, permanent loans or purchases of several libraries belonging to institutions and individuals. These include the French Revolution Broadsides donated by the 27th Earl of Crawford in 1924 and the archives of the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1977. In 1924 the library purchased the greater part of the French revolutionary collection of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana; and then on the occasion of the library&#x27;s semi-jubilee the 27th Earl of Crawford donated the French Revolutionary Broadsides from the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. Between 1946 and 1988 a number of sections of the Earl of Crawford&#x27;s library were deposited here, however all but one of these were withdrawn in 1988.

The British Pop Archive, a national collection dedicated to the preservation and research of popular culture, opened with an exhibition at the library in May 2022.

==Staff==
Librarians at John Rylands before its merger include Edward Gordon Duff in 1899 and 1900 and Henry Guppy between 1899 and 1948 (joint Librarian with Duff until 1900). Duff was responsible for the original library catalogue, compiled between 1893 and 1899: &quot;Catalogue of the Printed Books and Manuscripts in the John Rylands Library, Manchester&quot;; ed. E. G. Duff. Manchester: J. E. Cornish, 1899. 3 vols. The cataloguing of the books was done by Alice Margaret Cooke, a graduate of the Victoria University. Dr Guppy began publication of the &quot;Bulletin of the John Rylands Library&quot; in 1903; it later became a journal publishing academic articles and from autumn 1972 the title was changed to the &quot;Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester&quot; (further slight changes have occurred since).

During the First World War 11 members of staff joined the armed forces; of these only Capt. O. J. Sutton, MC, lost his life while serving. Other noteworthy members of staff were James Rendel Harris, Alphonse Mingana, the Semitic scholar Professor Edward Robertson (d. 1964) who was the third librarian, and Moses Tyson, keeper of western manuscripts, afterwards librarian of Manchester University Library. Stella Butler, a medical historian, was Head of Special Collections from 2000 until 2009, and she moved to the University of Leeds in 2011 as University Librarian. From 2009 to 2019, Rachel Beckett was Head of Special Collections and Associate Director of The John Rylands Library. Christopher Pressler was appointed John Rylands University Librarian and Director of The University of Manchester Library in February 2019.

==John Rylands Research Institute==
The John Rylands Research Institute was originally founded by Acting Librarian David Miller in 1987, to promote, fund and stimulate research on the primary material held at Deansgate. It was relaunched in 2013, with Professor Peter Pormann as director, as a collaboration between The University of Manchester&#x27;s Faculty of Humanities and The John Rylands Library. The mission of the Institute is to open up the Library&#x27;s Special Collections to innovative and multidisciplinary research, in partnership with researchers in Manchester and across the globe. Since its inception, the Institute has gained both national and international recognition and has been involved in attracting grants to support research on the collections from funders including the Arts and Humanities Research Council, Leverhulme Trust, British Academy and Marie Curie Foundation. In addition, generous philanthropic donations from Amin Amiri, David Shreeve, The Soudavar Memorial Foundation and Mark Younger, amongst others, have helped to support a range of important projects.

In September 2016, Hannah Barker, Professor of British History, took up the role as Director of the John Rylands Research Institute, and in March 2021, the John Rylands Research Institute and The John Rylands Library forged a new partnership as the John Rylands Research Institute and Library. 

==Governors and Trustees==
Mrs. Rylands established a board of trustees to hold the library&#x27;s assets and a council of governors to maintain the building and control expenditure. The council consisted of some representative and some co-optative governors while honorary governors were not members of the council. Both these bodies were dissolved at the merger in 1972. Members of the council of governors included Professor Arthur Peake and Professor F. F. Bruce both biblical critics and Rylands Professors of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis.

==Visitors==
Many notable people including heads of state have visited the library. King Charles III and Queen Camilla (as The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall) have also visited.

<text>A boater (also straw boater, basher, skimmer, The English Panama, cady, katie, canotier, somer, or sennit hat) is a semi-formal summer hat for men, which was popularised in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

It is normally made of stiff sennit straw and has a stiff flat crown and brim, typically with a solid or striped grosgrain ribbon around the crown. Boaters were derived from the canotier straw hat worn traditionally by gondoliers in the city of Venice. The Venetian canotier has a ribbon that hangs freely off the back, and they are frequently edged with a matching color ribbon. Because of this, boaters were identified with boating or sailing, hence the name. Boaters were also identified more with sporting events and universities as well. They were also worn by women, often with hatpins to keep them in place. Nowadays they are rarely seen except at sailing or rowing events, period-related theatrical and musical performances (e.g. barbershop music) or as part of old-fashioned school uniforms. Since 1952, the straw boater hat has been part of the uniform of the Princeton University Band, notably featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated Magazine&quot; in October 1955. Recently, soft, thin straw hats with the approximate shape of a boater have been in fashion among women.

The boater is a semi-formal hat, equivalent in formality to the Homburg. As such, it is correctly worn either in its original setting with a blazer, or in the same situations as a Homburg, such as a smart lounge suit, or with black tie. John Jacob Astor IV was known for wearing such hats. Actors Harold Lloyd and Maurice Chevalier were also famous for their trademark boater hats.

Inexpensive foam or plastic boaters are sometimes seen at political rallies in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa the boater is still a part of the school uniform in some very prestigious boys&#x27; schools, such as at Harrow School, Uppingham School, Shore School, Brisbane Boys&#x27; College, Knox Grammar School, Maritzburg College, Potchefstroom High School for Boys, South African College School, St John&#x27;s College, Wynberg Boys&#x27; High School, Parktown Boys&#x27; High School and numerous Christian Brothers schools.

The boater may also be seen worn by the &quot;carreiros&quot; of Madeira, the drivers of the traditional wicker toboggans carrying visitors from the parish church at Monte down towards Funchal centre.

Coco Chanel was fond of wearing boaters and made them fashionable among women during the early 20th century.

Boater hats of the late 19th century fin de siècle until World War I usually had wider brims than those afterwards. The narrower style that came into fashion following WWI was specifically known in Germany by the colloquial term &quot;Kreissäge&quot; (&quot;circular saw&quot;), whereas the official German term for it was &quot;(Florentiner) Strohhut&quot; (&quot;(Florentine) straw hat&quot;).

== Straw Hat Day ==
Being made of straw, the boater was and is generally regarded as a warm-weather hat. In the days when all men in Western Europe and the US wore hats when out of doors, &quot;Straw Hat Day&quot;, the day when men switched from wearing their winter hats to their summer hats, was seen as a sign of the beginning of summer. The exact date of Straw Hat Day (observed in April or May) varied slightly from place to place or even within a city. For example, in Philadelphia, it was generally May 15, but the University of Pennsylvania (located in Philadelphia) observed the change on the second Saturday in May. Its cold-weather counterpart was &quot;Felt Hat Day&quot;, occurring in September or October. As late as 1963, Straw and Felt Hat Day were commemorated in an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, even if both types of hats were essentially supplanted by lighter styles (primarily fedoras) after 1930.

In some cities, the convention was forcefully observed by young men who would seize and destroy any straw hat worn after the appointed day. On a number of stock exchange floors, traders wore straw hats with the deliberate intention of getting them destroyed. The term &quot;straw hat day&quot; was used in that era to refer both to the day of their adoption, at the beginning of summer, and their destruction, at the end. In 1922 in New York City, the tradition escalated into the Straw Hat Riot, which lasted eight days, involved a mob of 1,000 young hat destroyers at its peak, and resulted in a number of arrests and injuries.

Broken boater hats were sometimes worn for comedy effect. Bud Flanagan of the British comedy double act Flanagan and Allen was a case in point. His trademark broken boaters were, in fact, made purposely for him

<text>William Clarke Quantrill (July 31, 1837 – June 6, 1865) was a Confederate guerrilla leader during the American Civil War.

Quantrill experienced a turbulent childhood, became a schoolteacher, and joined a group of bandits who roamed the Missouri and Kansas countryside to apprehend escaped slaves. The group became irregular pro-Confederate soldiers called Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders, a partisan ranger outfit best known for its often brutal guerrilla tactics, and including the young Jesse James and his older brother Frank James.

The James brothers joined after their family were attacked by Union troops. Jesse at age 14 was surrounded by mounted Union militia while plowing a field behind his house. Refusing to give up information on his brother, Frank, and Quantrill, he was beaten and left bleeding. When he returned home, he found his stepfather, Dr. Reuben Samuel, had been hanged in a tree by Union troops. Samuel was tortured by the Union in an attempt to get information on Quantrill&#x27;s whereabouts, Jesse found him, and his mother, Zerelda, frantically trying to cut Samuel down. Dr. Samuel did not die from the hanging but his brain was so deprived of oxygen, it left him mentally incapacitated for the rest of his life. Zeralda, pregnant at the time, was also abused causing her to miscarry. Frank Dalton, a cousin of the James brothers, recalls what Federal troops did to Zerelda, &quot;Jennison&#x27;s Jayhawkers, visiting the home of the James brothers and taking the women, Aunt Zerelda, the mother of Frank and Jesse, their sister, and my mother and sisters, and after stripping them to the waist they tied them to trees and taking a blacksnake whip that they found in the stable they whipped them until they got tired and then rode away, leaving the women and girls to be cut down and carried into the house by our negro slaves, who washed and bandaged their bleeding backs and bodies and put them to bed.&quot;

Other men, such as the Berry brothers, Dick, James and Issac, from Callaway County, rode with Quantrill because of atrocities committed against their civilian families by Union troops from the nearby town of Danville. The Berry brothers found their father hanged from the rafters of his barn, and their sisters, 20 year old Katherine, 18 year old Nancy, 14 year old Elizabeth, and 11 year old Salli Ann, raped by the Federals. In retaliation, the Berry brothers participated in a raid on Danville, in 1864, burning it to the ground and killing many of the men who participated in the rapes of their sisters.

Quantrill was influential to many bandits, outlaws, and hired guns of the American frontier as it was being settled. On August 21, 1863, Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders committed the Lawrence Massacre. In May 1865, Quantrill was mortally wounded in combat by U.S. troops in Central Kentucky in one of the last engagements of the American Civil War. He died of his wounds in June 1865.

==Early life==
William Quantrill was born at Canal Dover, Ohio, on July 31, 1837. His father was Thomas Henry Quantrill, formerly of Hagerstown, Maryland, and his mother, Caroline Cornelia Clark, was a native of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. William was the oldest of twelve children, four of whom died in infancy. Quantrill taught school in Ohio when he was sixteen. In 1854, his abusive father died of tuberculosis, leaving the family with a huge financial debt. Quantrill&#x27;s mother turned the home into a boarding house to survive. During this time, Quantrill helped support the family by working as a schoolteacher, but he left home a year later for Mendota, Illinois. There, Quantrill worked in the lumberyards, unloading timber from rail cars.

Authorities briefly arrested him for murder, but Quantrill claimed he had acted in self-defense. Quantrill was set free since there were no eyewitnesses, and the victim was a stranger who knew no one in town. Nevertheless, the police strongly urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued teaching, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in February 1856. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover late that year.

Quantrill spent the winter in his family&#x27;s diminutive shack in the impoverished town and soon grew restless. Many Ohioans migrated to the Kansas Territory for cheap land and opportunity. This included Henry Torrey and Harmon Beeson, two local men hoping to build a large farm for their families out west. Although they mistrusted the 19-year-old Quantrill, his mother&#x27;s pleadings persuaded them to let Quantrill accompany them to turn his life around. The party of three departed in late February 1857. Torrey and Beeson agreed to pay for Quantrill&#x27;s land in exchange for a couple of months&#x27; worth of work. They settled at Marais des Cygnes, but a dispute arose over the claim, and Quantrill sued Torrey and Beeson. The court awarded Torrey and Beeson what was owed to them, but Quantrill paid only half of what the court had mandated. Although his relationship with Beeson was never the same, Quantrill remained friends with Torrey.

Soon, Quantrill accompanied a large group of hometown friends in their quest to settle near Tuscarora Lake. However, neighbors soon began to notice Quantrill stealing goods out of other people&#x27;s cabins and banished him from the community in January 1858. Soon thereafter, Quantrill signed on as a teamster with the US Army expedition heading to Salt Lake City, Utah in early 1858. Quantrill&#x27;s journey out west is little known except that he excelled at poker. Quantrill racked up piles of winnings by playing the game against his comrades at Fort Bridger but lost it all on one hand, leaving him broke. Quantrill then joined a group of Missouri ruffians and became a drifter. The group helped protect pro-slavery Missouri farmers from the Jayhawkers for pay and slept wherever they could find lodging. Quantrill traveled back to Utah and then to Colorado but returned in less than a year to Lawrence, Kansas, in 1859 where he taught at a schoolhouse until it closed in 1860. Quantrill then partnered with brigands and turned to cattle rustling and anything else to earn him money. Quantrill also learned the profitability of capturing runaway slaves and devised plans to use free black men as bait for runaway slaves, whom he subsequently captured and returned to their enslavers in exchange for reward money.

Before 1860, Quantrill appeared to oppose slavery. He wrote to his good friend W.W. Scott in January 1858 that the Lecompton Constitution was a &quot;swindle&quot; and that James Henry Lane, a Northern sympathizer, was &quot;as good a man as we have here&quot;. He also called the Democrats &quot;the worst men we have for they are all rascals, for no one can be a democrat here without being one&quot;. However, in February 1860, Quantrill wrote a letter to his mother that expressed his views on the anti-slavery supporters. Quantrill told her that slavery was right and that he detested Jim Lane. He said that the hanging of John Brown had been too good for him and that &quot;the devil has got unlimited sway over this territory, and will hold it until we have a better set of man and society generally.&quot;

==Guerrilla leader==
In 1861, Quantrill went to Texas with the enslaver Marcus Gill. They met Joel B. Mayes and joined the Cherokee Nations. Mayes, of mixed Scots-Irish and Cherokee descent, was a Confederate sympathizer and a war chief of the Cherokee Nations in Texas. Mayes had moved from Georgia to the old Indian Territory in 1838. Mayes enlisted and served as a private in Company A of the 1st Cherokee Regiment in the Confederate army. Mayes taught Quantrill guerrilla warfare tactics, ambush fighting tactics used by Native Americans, camouflage, and sneak attack tactics. Quantrill, in the company of Mayes and the Cherokee Nations, joined with General Sterling Price and fought at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek and First Battle of Lexington in August and September 1861.

In late September Quantrill went to Blue Springs, Missouri, to form his own partisan unit made of loyal men who had great belief in him and the Confederate cause, and they came to be known as &quot;Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders&quot;. By Christmas 1861, ten men followed Quantrill full-time in his pro-Confederate guerrilla organization: William Haller, George Todd, Joseph Gilcrist, Perry Hoy, John Little, James Little, Joseph Baughan, William H. Gregg, James A. Hendricks, and John W. Koger. Later, in 1862, John Jarrett, John Brown (not to be confused with the abolitionist John Brown), Cole Younger, William T. &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson, and the James brothers would join Quantrill&#x27;s army. On March 7, 1862, Quantrill and his men attacked a small US Army outpost in Aubry, Kansas, and ransacked the town.

On March 11, 1862, Quantrill joined Confederate forces under Colonel John T. Hughes and took part in an attack on Independence, Missouri. After what became known as the First Battle of Independence, the Confederate government decided to secure the loyalty of Quantrill by issuing him a &quot;formal army commission&quot; to the rank of captain.

In the early hours of September 7, 1862, William Quantrill and a force of 140 men seized control of Olathe, Kansas, capturing 125 US Army soldiers. On October 5, 1862, Quantrill attacked and destroyed Shawneetown, Kansas; William T. Anderson soon revisited and torched the rebuilding settlement. On November 5, 1862, Quantrill joined Colonel Warner Lewis to stage an attack on Lamar, Missouri, where a company of the 8th Regiment Missouri Volunteer Cavalry protected a US Army outpost. Warned about the attack, the US soldiers repelled the raiders, who torched part of the town before they retreated.

==Lawrence Massacre==

The most significant event in Quantrill&#x27;s guerrilla career occurred on August 21, 1863. Lawrence had been seen for years as the stronghold of the antislavery forces in Kansas and as a base of operation for incursions into Missouri by Jayhawkers and pro-Union forces. It was also the home of James Henry Lane, a US senator known for his staunch opposition to slavery and a leader of the Jayhawkers.

During the weeks immediately preceding the raid, US Army General Thomas Ewing, Jr., ordered the detention of any civilians giving aid to Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders. Several female relatives of the guerrillas were imprisoned in a makeshift jail in Kansas City, Missouri. On August 14, the building collapsed, killing four young women and seriously injuring others. Among the dead was Josephine Anderson, the sister of one of Quantrill&#x27;s key guerrilla allies, Bill Anderson. Another of Anderson&#x27;s sisters, Mary, was permanently crippled in the collapse. Quantrill&#x27;s men believed the collapse was deliberate, which infuriated them.

Some historians have suggested that Quantrill planned to raid Lawrence before the building&#x27;s collapse, in retaliation for earlier Jayhawker attacks as well as the burning of Osceola, Missouri.

Early in the morning of August 21, Quantrill descended from Mount Oread and attacked Lawrence with a combined force of 450 guerrilla fighters. Lane, a prime target of the raid, managed to escape through a cornfield in his nightshirt, but the guerrillas, on Quantrill&#x27;s orders, killed around 150 men and boys who could carry a rifle. When Quantrill&#x27;s men rode out at 9 a.m., most of Lawrence&#x27;s buildings were burning, including all but two businesses.

By comparison Lane&#x27;s Union raid on Osceola was four times more destructive than Quantrill&#x27;s raid on Lawrence. Of the 800 buildings in Osceola, only 3 were left standing. Lane&#x27;s plunder included 350 horses, 400 head of cattle, 3000 sacks of flower, 500 pounds of molasses/sugar, and 50 sacks of coffee. Lane&#x27;s plunder wagon consisted of 150 wagons stretching a mile long. Osceola property losses were estimated at a million dollars.

On August 25, in retaliation for the raid, General Ewing authorized General Order No. 11 (not to be confused with General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s order of the same name). The edict ordered the depopulation of three and a half Missouri counties along the Kansas border except for a few designated towns, which forced tens of thousands of civilians to abandon their homes. Union troops marched through behind them and burned buildings, torched planted fields, and shot down livestock to deprive the guerrillas of food, fodder, and support. The area was so thoroughly devastated that it was known as the &quot;Burnt District&quot;.

In early October, Quantrill and his men rode south to Texas, to pass the winter. On the way, on October 6, Quantrill attacked Fort Blair in Baxter Springs, Kansas, which resulted in the so-called Battle of Baxter Springs. After being repelled, Quantrill surprised and destroyed a US Army relief column under General James G. Blunt, who escaped, but Quantrill killed almost 100 US Army soldiers.

In Texas, on May 18, 1864, Quantrill&#x27;s sympathizers lynched Collin County Sheriff Captain James L. Read for shooting the Calhoun Brothers from Quantrill&#x27;s force who had killed a farmer in Millwood, Texas.

==Last years==
While in Texas, Quantrill and his 400 men quarreled. His once-large band broke up into several smaller guerrilla companies. One was led by his lieutenant, &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson, and Quantrill joined it briefly in the fall of 1864 during a fight north of the Missouri River.

In early 1865, now leading only a few dozen bushwackers, Quantrill staged a series of raids in western Kentucky. Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses Grant on April 9, and General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered most of the rest of the Confederate Army to General Sherman on April 26. On May 10, the US Army caught up to Quantrill and his band in an ambush in Wakefield, Kentucky. While attempting to flee on a skittish horse, Quantrill was shot in the back and paralyzed from the chest down. The unit that successfully ambushed Quantrill and his followers was led by Edwin W. Terrell, a guerrilla hunter charged with finding and eliminating high-profile targets by General John M. Palmer, the commander of the District of Kentucky. US officials, Palmer and Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, did not wish to see Quantrill staging a repeat of his performance in Missouri in 1862–1863. Quantrill was brought by wagon to Louisville, Kentucky, and taken to the military prison hospital on the north side of Broadway at 10th Street. He died from his wounds on June 6, 1865, at the age of 27.

==Burial==
Quantrill was buried in an unmarked grave in what became known as St. John&#x27;s Cemetery in Louisville. A boyhood friend of Quantrill, the newspaper reporter William W. Scott, claimed to have dug up the Louisville grave in 1887 and brought Quantrill&#x27;s remains back to Dover at the request of Quantrill&#x27;s mother. The remains were supposedly buried in Dover in 1889, but Scott attempted to sell what he said were Quantrill&#x27;s bones, so it is unknown if the remains he returned to Dover or buried in Dover were genuine. In the early 1990s, the Missouri division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans convinced the Kansas State Historical Society to negotiate with authorities in Dover, which led to three arm bones, two leg bones, and some hair, all of which were allegedly Quantrill&#x27;s, being re-buried in 1992 at the Old Confederate Veteran&#x27;s Home Cemetery in Higginsville, Missouri. As a result, there are grave markers for Quantrill in Louisville, Dover, and Higginsville.

==Claims of survival==
In August 1907, news articles appeared in Canada and the US that claimed that J.E. Duffy, a member of a Michigan cavalry troop that had dealt with Quantrill&#x27;s raiders during the war, met Quantrill at Quatsino Sound on northern Vancouver Island, while he was investigating timber rights in the area. Duffy claimed to recognize the man, living under the name of John Sharp, as Quantrill. Duffy said that Sharp admitted he was Quantrill and discussed raids in Kansas and elsewhere in detail. Sharp claimed that he had survived the ambush in Kentucky but received a bayonet and bullet wound, making his way to South America, where he lived some years in Chile. He returned to the US and worked as a cattleman in Fort Worth, Texas. He then moved to Oregon, acting as a cowpuncher and drover, before he reached British Columbia in the 1890s, where he worked in logging, trapping, and finally as a mine caretaker at Coal Harbour at Quatsino. Within weeks after the news stories were published, two men came to British Columbia, traveling to Quatsino from Victoria, leaving Quatsino on a return voyage of a coastal steamer the next day. On that day, Sharp was found severely beaten and died several hours later without giving information about his attackers. The police failed to solve the murder.

Another legend that has circulated claims that Quantrill may have escaped custody and fled to Arkansas, where he lived under the name of L.J. Crocker until he died in 1917.

The family of Major Cornelius Boyle believed that Quantrill had actually served as a bodyguard for the Provost Marshal General when he visited Mexico after the war, while Jubal Early was also in the country as they sought out an alternate resolution.

==Personal life==
During the war, Quantrill met the 13-year-old Sarah Katherine King at her parents&#x27; farm in Blue Springs, Missouri. They never married, although she often visited and lived in camp with Quantrill and his men. At the time of his death, she was 17.

==Legacy==

Quantrill&#x27;s actions were barbaric. Historians view him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw. James M. McPherson, one of the most prominent experts on the American Civil War, calls Quantrill and Anderson &quot;pathological killers&quot; who &quot;murdered and burned out Missouri Unionists&quot;. The historian Matthew Christopher Hulbert argues that Quantrill &quot;ruled the bushwhacker pantheon&quot; established by the ex-Confederate officer and propagandist John Newman Edwards in the 1870s to provide Missouri with its own &quot;irregular Lost Cause&quot;. Some of Quantrill&#x27;s celebrity later rubbed off on other ex-Raiders, like John Jarrett, George and Oliver Shepherd, Jesse and Frank James, and Cole Younger, who went on after the war to apply Quantrill&#x27;s hit-and-run tactics to bank and train robbery.

<text>The Stock Exchange Building () is a building originally erected for the Stockholm Stock Exchange between 1773 and 1778 from construction drawings by Erik Palmstedt. The stock exchange moved out of the building completely in 1998. It is located on the north side of the square Stortorget in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, and owned by the city council. Since 1914 it has been the home of the Swedish Academy, which uses the building for its meetings, such as those at which it selects and announces the name of the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The building also houses the Nobel Museum and the Nobel Library.

==History==
Previously the old Rådstugan was located here, which was a collection of buildings with partly medieval origins, and which gave the neighborhood its name.

===1776===
The Stock Exchange was inaugurated in 1776 by Gustav III in the main stock exchange hall. The purpose of the building was to meet the need for premises for stock exchange trading. The building was largely financed by the &quot;börstolagen&quot; (Stock Exchange Law) which was an extra duty decided by the Riksdag.

<text>Carlo Matteucci (20 June 1811 – 24 June 1868) was an Italian physicist and neurophysiologist who was a pioneer in the study of bioelectricity.

== Biography ==
Carlo Matteucci was born at Forlì, in the province of Romagna, to Vincenzo Matteucci, a physician, and Chiara Folfi. He studied mathematics at the University of Bologna from 1825 to 1828, receiving his doctorate in 1829. From 1829 to 1831, he studied at the École Polytechnique in Paris, France. Upon returning to Italy, Matteucci studied at Bologna (1832), Florence, Ravenna (1837) and Pisa. He established himself as the head of the laboratory of the Hospital of Ravenna and became a professor of physics at the local college. In 1840, by recommendation of François Arago (1786–1853), his teacher at the École Polytechnique, to the Grand-Duke of Tuscany, Matteucci accepted a post of professor of physics at the University of Pisa.

Instigated by the work of Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) on bioelectricity, Matteucci began in 1830 a series of experiments which he pursued until his death in 1865. Using a sensitive galvanometer of Leopoldo Nobili, he was able to prove that injured excitable biological tissues generated direct electrical currents, and that they could be summed up by adding elements in series, like in Alessandro Volta’s (1745-1827) electric pile. Thus, Mateucci was able to develop what he called a &quot;rheoscopic frog&quot;, by using the cut nerve of a frog&#x27;s leg and its attached muscle as a kind of sensitive electricity detector. His work in bioelectricity influenced directly the research developed by Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896), a student of the great German biologist Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858) in Berlin, who tried the duplicate Matteucci&#x27;s experiments and ended up discovering the nerve&#x27;s action potential. In 1844, for these studies, Matteucci was awarded with the Copley medal by the Royal Society.

From 1847, he took an active part in politics, and in 1860 was chosen an Italian senator, at the same time becoming inspector-general of the Italian telegraph lines. Two years later he was appointed Minister of Education.

Matteucci died in the Ardenza neighbourhood of Livorno in 1868.

== Works ==

Matteucci was the author of four scientific treatises in physics:
* (2 vols., Pisa, 1841)
* (Pisa, 1844)
* (Pisa, 1850)
* , etc. (Paris, 1854).
* (1844) 
* (1857)

His numerous papers were published in the (1829–1858); and most of them also appeared at the time in the Italian scientific journals. They relate almost entirely to electrical phenomena, such as the magnetic rotation of light, the action of gas batteries, the effects of torsion on magnetism, the electric polarization of electrodes, etc., sufficiently complete accounts of which are given in Wiedemann&#x27;s .

Nine memoirs, entitled &quot;Electro-Physiological Researches&quot;, were published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, 1845–1860. See Bianchi&#x27;s (Rome, 1874).

<text>An ecological fallacy (also ecological &quot;inference&quot; fallacy or population fallacy) is a formal fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data that occurs when inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inferences about the group to which those individuals belong. &quot;Ecological fallacy&quot; is a term that is sometimes used to describe the fallacy of division, which is not a statistical fallacy. The four common statistical ecological fallacies are: confusion between ecological correlations and individual correlations, confusion between group average and total average, Simpson&#x27;s paradox, and confusion between higher average and higher likelihood. From a statistical point of view, these ideas can be unified by specifying proper statistical models to make formal inferences, using aggregate data to make unobserved relationships in individual level data.

== Examples ==
=== Mean and median ===

An example of ecological fallacy is the assumption that a population mean has a simple interpretation when considering likelihoods for an individual.

For instance, if the mean score of a group is larger than zero, this does not imply that a random individual of that group is more likely to have a positive score than a negative one (as long as there are more negative scores than positive scores an individual is more likely to have a negative score). Similarly, if a particular group of people is measured to have a lower mean IQ than the general population, it is an error to conclude that a randomly-selected member of the group is more likely than not to have a lower IQ than the mean IQ of the general population; it is also not necessarily the case that a randomly selected member of the group is more likely than not to have a lower IQ than a randomly-selected member of the general population. Mathematically, this comes from the fact that a distribution can have a positive mean but a negative median. This property is linked to the skewness of the distribution.

Consider the following numerical example:
* Group A: 80% of people got 40 points and 20% of them got 95 points. The mean score is 51 points.
* Group B: 50% of people got 45 points and 50% got 55 points. The mean score is 50 points.
* If we pick two people at random from A and B, there are 4 possible outcomes:
** A – 40, B – 45 (B wins, 40% probability – 0.8 × 0.5)
** A – 40, B – 55 (B wins, 40% probability – 0.8 × 0.5)
** A – 95, B – 45 (A wins, 10% probability – 0.2 × 0.5)
** A – 95, B – 55 (A wins, 10% probability – 0.2 × 0.5)
* Although Group A has a higher mean score, 80% of the time a random individual of A will score lower than a random individual of B.

=== Individual and aggregate correlations ===
Research dating back to Émile Durkheim suggests that predominantly Protestant localities have higher suicide rates than predominantly Catholic localities. According to Freedman, the idea that Durkheim&#x27;s findings link, at an individual level, a person&#x27;s religion to their suicide risk is an example of the ecological fallacy. A group-level relationship does not automatically characterize the relationship at the level of the individual.

Similarly, even if at the individual level, wealth is positively correlated to tendency to vote Republican in the United States, we observe that wealthier states tend to vote Democratic. For example, in the 2004 United States presidential election, the Republican candidate, George W. Bush, won the fifteen poorest states, and the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, won 9 of the 11 wealthiest states in the Electoral College. Yet 62% of voters with annual incomes over $200,000 voted for Bush, but only 36% of voters with annual incomes of $15,000 or less voted for Bush.
Aggregate-level correlation will differ from individual-level correlation if voting preferences are affected by the total wealth of the state even after controlling for individual wealth. The true driving factor in voting preference could be self-perceived &quot;relative&quot; wealth; perhaps those who see themselves as better off than their neighbours are more likely to vote Republican. In this case, an individual would be more likely to vote Republican if they became wealthier, but they would be more likely to vote for a Democrat if their neighbor&#x27;s wealth increased (resulting in a wealthier state).

However, the observed difference in voting habits based on state- and individual-level wealth could also be explained by the common confusion between higher averages and higher likelihoods as discussed above. States may not be wealthier because they contain more wealthy people (i.e., more people with annual incomes over $200,000), but rather because they contain a small number of super-rich individuals; the ecological fallacy then results from incorrectly assuming that individuals in wealthier states are more likely to be wealthy.

Many examples of ecological fallacies can be found in studies of social networks, which often combine analysis and implications from different levels. This has been illustrated in an academic paper on networks of farmers in Sumatra.

=== Robinson&#x27;s paradox ===
A 1950 paper by William S. Robinson computed the illiteracy rate and the proportion of the population born outside the US for each state and for the District of Columbia, as of the 1930 census. He showed that these two figures were associated with a negative correlation of −0.53; in other words, the greater the proportion of immigrants in a state, the lower its average illiteracy (or, equivalently, the higher its average literacy). However, when individuals are considered, the correlation between illiteracy and nativity was +0.12 (immigrants were on average more illiterate than native citizens). Robinson showed that the negative correlation at the level of state populations was because immigrants tended to settle in states where the native population was more literate. He cautioned against deducing conclusions about individuals on the basis of population-level, or &quot;ecological&quot; data. In 2011, it was found that Robinson&#x27;s calculations of the ecological correlations are based on the wrong state level data. The correlation of −0.53 mentioned above is in fact −0.46. Robinson&#x27;s paper was seminal, but the term &#x27;ecological fallacy&#x27; was not coined until 1958 by Selvin.

=== Formal problem ===
The correlation of aggregate quantities (or ecological correlation) is not equal to the correlation of individual quantities. Denote by &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; two quantities at the individual level. The formula for the covariance of the aggregate quantities in groups of size &quot;N&quot; is

:formula_1

The covariance of two aggregated variables depends not only on the covariance of two variables within the same individuals but also on covariances of the variables between different individuals. In other words, correlation of aggregate variables take into account cross sectional effects which are not relevant at the individual level.

The problem for correlations entails naturally a problem for regressions on aggregate variables: the correlation fallacy is therefore an important issue for a researcher who wants to measure causal impacts. Start with a regression model where the outcome formula_2 is impacted by formula_3

:formula_4
:formula_5

The regression model at the aggregate level is obtained by summing the individual equations:

:formula_6
:formula_7

Nothing prevents the regressors and the errors from being correlated at the aggregate level. Therefore, generally, running a regression on aggregate data does not estimate the same model than running a regression with individual data.

The aggregate model is correct if and only if

:formula_8

This means that, controlling for formula_3, formula_10 does not determine formula_11.

=== Choosing between aggregate and individual inference ===
There is nothing wrong in running regressions on aggregate data if one is interested in the aggregate model. For instance, for the governor of a state, it is correct to run regressions between police force on crime rate at the state level if one is interested in the policy implication of a rise in police force. However, an ecological fallacy would happen if a city council deduces the impact of an increase in police force in the crime rate at the city level from the correlation at the state level.

Choosing to run aggregate or individual regressions to understand aggregate impacts on some policy depends on the following trade-off: aggregate regressions lose individual-level data but individual regressions add strong modeling assumptions. Some researchers suggest that the ecological correlation gives a better picture of the outcome of public policy actions, thus they recommend the ecological correlation over the individual level correlation for this purpose (Lubinski &amp; Humphreys, 1996). Other researchers disagree, especially when the relationships among the levels are not clearly modeled. To prevent ecological fallacy, researchers with no individual data can model first what is occurring at the individual level, then model how the individual and group levels are related, and finally examine whether anything occurring at the group level adds to the understanding of the relationship. For instance, in evaluating the impact of state policies, it is helpful to know that policy impacts vary less among the states than do the policies themselves, suggesting that the policy differences are not well translated into results, despite high ecological correlations (Rose, 1973).

== Group and total averages ==
Ecological fallacy can also refer to the following fallacy: the average for a group is approximated by the average in the total population divided by the group size. Suppose one knows the number of Protestants and the suicide rate in the USA, but one does not have data linking religion and suicide at the individual level. If one is interested in the suicide rate of Protestants, it is a mistake to estimate it by the total suicide rate divided by the number of Protestants.
Formally, denote formula_12 the mean of the group, we generally have:

:formula_13

However, the law of total probability gives
:formula_14

As we know that formula_15 is between 0 and 1, this equation gives a bound for formula_12.

== Simpson&#x27;s paradox ==
A striking ecological fallacy is &quot;Simpson&#x27;s paradox&quot;: the fact that when comparing two populations divided into groups, the average of some variable in the first population can be higher in every group and yet lower in the total population. Formally, when each value of &quot;Z&quot; refers to a different group and &quot;X&quot; refers to some treatment, it can happen that

:formula_17

When formula_18 does not depend on formula_19, the Simpson&#x27;s paradox is exactly the omitted variable bias for the regression of &quot;Y&quot; on &quot;X&quot; where the regressor formula_20 is a dummy variable and the omitted variable formula_19 is a categorical variable defining groups for each value it takes. The application is striking because the bias is high enough that parameters have opposite signs.

== Legal applications ==
The ecological fallacy was discussed in a court challenge to the 2004 Washington gubernatorial election in which a number of illegal voters were identified, after the election; their votes were unknown, because the vote was by secret ballot. The challengers argued that illegal votes cast in the election would have followed the voting patterns of the precincts in which they had been cast, and thus adjustments should be made accordingly. An expert witness said this approach was like trying to figure out Ichiro Suzuki&#x27;s batting average by looking at the batting average of the entire Seattle Mariners team, since the illegal votes were cast by an unrepresentative sample of each precinct&#x27;s voters, and might be as different from the average voter in the precinct as Ichiro was from the rest of his team. The judge determined that the challengers&#x27; argument was an ecological fallacy and rejected it.

<doc id="475603" wikidata="Q365985" url="?curid=475603" title="Claude François">
<text>Claude Antoine Marie François (; 1 February 1939 – 11 March 1978), also known by the nickname Cloclo, was a French pop singer, composer, songwriter, record producer, drummer and dancer. François co-wrote the lyrics of &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (composed by Jacques Revaux), the original version of &quot;My Way&quot; and composed the music of &quot;Parce que je t&#x27;aime mon enfant&quot;, the original version of &quot;My Boy&quot;. Among his other famous songs are &quot;Le Téléphone Pleure&quot;, &quot;Le lundi au soleil&quot;, &quot;Magnolias for Ever&quot; and &quot;Alexandrie Alexandra&quot;. He also enjoyed considerable success with French-language versions of English-language songs, including &quot;Belles! Belles! Belles!&quot; (The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Made to Love&quot;), &quot;Cette année là&quot; (&quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot;) and &quot;Je vais à Rio&quot; (&quot;I Go to Rio&quot;).

Claude François sold more than 20 million records during his career, and 6 million since his death. He was about to embark for the United States when he was accidentally electrocuted in March 1978 at age 39. Former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing is quoted as saying Claude François was, to him, &quot;the French equivalent of The Beatles, meaning the great talent of a generation&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of a French father and an Italian mother, Claude Antoine Marie François was born in Egypt, in the city of Ismaïlia, where his father, Aimé François (1908–1961), was working as a senior manager in the Anglo-French Suez canal company on the Suez Canal. In 1951, the job took the family to the city of Port Tewfik (now Suez Port). François had an older sister, Josette (born 1934), who wrote her memoirs in 2008.

François&#x27; mother, Lucia Mazzeï (1910–1992) was very musical and had her son take piano and violin lessons. On his own, the boy learned to play the drums. As a result of the 1956 Suez Crisis, the family returned to live in Monaco. The family&#x27;s expulsion from Egypt was traumatic. They struggled financially after François&#x27; father fell ill and could not work. François found a job as a bank clerk and at night earned extra money playing drums with an orchestra at the luxury hotels along the French Riviera. With a good singing voice, he was offered a chance to sing at a hotel in the fashionable Mediterranean resort town of Juan-les-Pins. His show was well received, and he began to perform at the nightclubs along the Côte d&#x27;Azur, including the Monte-Carlo Sporting, where in 1959, he met Janet Woollacott; they wed in 1960.

==Professional career and personal life==

François moved to Paris, where there were many more opportunities to pursue his career. At the time, American rock and roll was taking hold in France and he took a job as part of a singing group to make a living. With the goal of eventually making it as a solo act, he paid the cost to record a 45rpm. Trying to capitalise on the American dance craze &quot;The Twist&quot;, he recorded a song titled &quot;Nabout Twist&quot; that proved a resounding failure. Undaunted, in 1962 he recorded a cover version in French of an Everly Brothers song, &quot;Made to Love&quot;, also known as &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, under the name &quot;Belles! Belles! Belles!&quot;.

François&#x27; career continued to blossom under a new manager. In 1963 he followed the first success with another French adaptation of an American song, this time recording &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; and &quot;Walk Right In&quot; in French as &quot;Si j&#x27;avais un marteau&quot; and &quot;Marche Tout Droit&quot;. François met Michel Bourdais who was working for the French magazine &quot;Salut les Copains&quot; (&quot;Hi Buddies&quot;) and he asked him to draw his portrait.

On 5 April 1963, he headlined at the Paris Olympia, a sign that he had arrived. 
In 1964, he dated 17-year-old Eurovision-winning singer, France Gall.
At the end of that year, François created original new dance steps, and Bourdais drew them. For the first time, they brought up the idea of setting up a show with female dancers.

In 1967, he and Jacques Revaux wrote and composed a song in French called &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (&quot;As Usual&quot;), which became a hit in Francophone countries. Canadian singer Paul Anka later wrote English lyrics for the song, to create &quot;My Way&quot;. François sang the original version of &quot;Parce que je t&#x27;aime, mon enfant&quot; (&quot;Because I Love You My Child&quot;) in 1971; it remained relatively little-known in France but Elvis Presley covered it under the title &quot;My Boy&quot;.

Although François continued his successful formula of adapting English and American rock and roll hits for the French market, by the 1970s the market had changed and the disco craze that swept North America took root in France. François adapted to the new trend, recording &quot;La plus belle chose du monde&quot;, a French version of the Bee Gees&#x27; hit record, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;.
Looking for new talent, he came across a singing family of two sisters and their cousins. These women became known as &quot;Les Flêchettes&quot; (named after &quot;Flèche&quot;, the production label he owned) and then &quot;Les Clodettes&quot;. He produced a couple of albums for them before his death, and they went on to sing for some of the major stars in European music. He worked non-stop, touring across Europe, Africa and at major venues in Quebec in Canada.

However, in 1971, his workload caught up with him when he collapsed on stage from exhaustion. After a brief period off, he returned to the recording studios, releasing several best-selling hits throughout the early 1970s. He expanded from owning his own record company to acquiring a celebrity magazine and a modelling agency.

==Philanthropy==
Although driven to achieve financial success, in 1974 he organised a concert to raise funds for a charity for handicapped children, and the following year he participated in a Paris concert to raise funds for medical research.

==Personal life==
In November 1960, he married French-British dancer Janet Woollacott. She left him in 1962, and he was finally divorced from her in 1967. This failed marriage was one of the three big traumas that affected his whole life. The relationship with France Gall ended in July 1967. After this, François had an affair with singer Annie Phillippe, who reportedly refused to marry him.

François soon got consolation when he arranged a date with model Isabelle Forêt, whom he had first met a few years before. Their relationship lasted from 1967 to 1972 and produced two sons, Claude Jr. in July 1968 and Marc in November 1969. He hid the existence from the public of his second son for five years because he thought that being a father of two would destroy his boyish image as &quot;a free man and seducer&quot;. His loyal fans knew &amp; had photos taken with him but kept it a secret

By 1972 he was single again, dating several well-known European stars. Finnish model Sofia Kiukkonen 1973–76 and American model Kathalyn (Kathleen) H. Jones-Mann 1976–78 were his most important relationships of this period. He also had an affair with his dresser Sylvie Mathurin from 1974 to 1978.

He continued to perform while overseeing his numerous business interests. In 1975, while in London, he narrowly escaped death when an IRA bomb exploded in the lobby of the Hilton hotel and two years later a fan tried to shoot him while he drove his car.

===International career===

He performed an international career mostly in Belgium and Switzerland, but also in Italy, Spain, England and Canada. In 1976, his song &quot;Le Telephone Pleure&quot; (&quot;Tears on the Telephone&quot;) reached No. 35 in the UK Singles Chart. On 16 January 1978, he performed, for the first time for a French singer, a gala at the Royal Albert Hall in London to an audience of 6000.

==Death==
After recording a television special for the BBC on 10 March 1978, François returned to his Paris apartment at 46 Boulevard Exelmans. He was due to appear on &quot;Les Rendez-vous du Dimanche&quot; with Michel Drucker. While preparing for a bath, François attempted to straighten a lightbulb in his bathroom lamp, causing him to receive a severe electric shock. He died in his apartment. 

His body was buried in the village of Dannemois, in the Essonne department (about south of Paris), near which Claude François owned a house where he spent his weekends.

==Legacy==
On 11 March 2000, the 22nd anniversary of his death, Place Claude-François in Paris was named in his memory; it is located in front of the building where he died.

The 2003 jukebox musical &quot;Belles belles belles&quot; is based on François&#x27; songs.

A biographical film called &quot;Cloclo&quot; (&quot;My Way&quot; internationally) was released in March 2012 to coincide with the anniversary of his death. It runs two and a half hours long and stars Jérémie Renier.

Claude François&#x27;s sons, Claude Jr and Marc, have assumed the management of their father&#x27;s artistic heritage over the years.

==Controversies==
A woman named Julie Bocquet maintains that François is her father. Fabienne, her mother, was 15 when she got pregnant. She lied about her age to him and said she was a lot older. Others have recently come forward as well.

<doc id="475607" wikidata="Q455990" url="?curid=475607" title="Amazake">
<text>is a traditional sweet, low-alcohol or non-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice. &quot;Amazake&quot; dates from the Kofun period, and it is mentioned in the Nihon Shoki. It is part of the family of traditional Japanese foods made using the koji mold , which also includes miso, soy sauce, and sake.

There are several recipes for &quot;amazake&quot; that have been used for hundreds of years. By a popular recipe, &quot;kōji&quot; is added to cooled whole grain rice causing enzymes to break down the carbohydrates into simpler unrefined sugars. As the mixture incubates, sweetness develops naturally. By another recipe, sake kasu is mixed with water and sugar is added.

&quot;Amazake&quot; can be used as a dessert, snack, natural sweetening agent, salad dressing or smoothie. One traditional &quot;amazake&quot; drink, prepared by combining &quot;amazake&quot; and water, heated to a simmer, and often topped with a pinch of finely grated ginger, was popular with street vendors, and it is still served at inns, teahouses, and at festivals. Many Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples provide or sell it in the New Year. In the 20th century, an instant version became available.

&quot;Amazake&quot; contains many nutrients, including vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, dietary fiber, oligosaccharide, cysteine, arginine and glutamine. It is often considered a hangover cure in Japan. Outside Japan, it is often sold in Asian grocery stores during the winter months, and, all year round, in natural food stores in the U.S. and Europe, as a beverage and natural sweetener.

Similar beverages include the Chinese &quot;jiuniang&quot; which is more pudding like and Korean &quot;gamju&quot; or &quot;sikhye&quot;. In grape winemaking, must – sweet, thick, unfermented grape juice – is a similar product.

<doc id="475611" wikidata="Q15525081" url="?curid=475611" title="John Rylands">
<text>John Rylands (7 February 1801 – 11 December 1888) was an English entrepreneur and philanthropist. He was the owner of the largest textile manufacturing concern in the United Kingdom, and Manchester&#x27;s first multi-millionaire.

After having learned to weave, Rylands became a small-scale manufacturer of hand-looms, while also working in the draper&#x27;s shop which his father had opened in St Helens. He displayed a &quot;precocious shrewdness&quot; for retailing, and in partnership with his two elder brothers expanded into the wholesale trade. So successful were they that, in 1819, Rylands&#x27; father merged his retail business with theirs, creating the firm of Rylands &amp; Sons. At its peak, the company employed a workforce of 15,000 in 17 mills and factories, producing 35 long tons of cloth a day.

==Biography==

Rylands was the third son of Joseph Rylands, a manufacturer of cotton goods, of St Helens, Lancashire, and his wife Elizabeth (née Pilkington). He was educated at St Helens Grammar School.

His aptitude for trade quickly became obvious and manifested itself early and, before the age of eighteen, he entered into partnership with his elder brothers Joseph and Richard. Their father joined them in 1819, when the firm of Rylands &amp; Sons was established, the seat of operations being established in Wigan. Their manufactures for some years consisted of ginghams, checks, ticks, dowlases, calicoes and linens.

John, the youngest partner, occupied himself with travelling over several counties for orders until 1823, when he opened a warehouse for the firm in Manchester. Business increased rapidly, and in the course of a few years extensive properties at Wigan, along with dye works and bleach works, were purchased. Valuable seams of coal were afterwards discovered under these properties, and proved a great source of wealth to the purchasers.

In 1825 the firm became merchants as well as manufacturers, and about the same time they erected a new spinning mill. The Ainsworth mills, near Bolton, and other factories were subsequently acquired.

Joseph and Richard retired around 1839 and the death of their father in July 1847 made John Rylands sole proprietor. The business continued to expand and in 1849 a warehouse was opened in Wood Street, London.

A great fire occurred at the Manchester warehouse in 1854 but the loss, although very large, was speedily repaired. By 1864 the warehouses were seven storeys high and extended all the way along New High Street (now High Street) in Manchester: &quot;they had become the summit of the firm&#x27;s hierarchical organization, the seat of its central power and the goal of all ambitious employees&quot; (D. A. Farnie, in &quot;John Rylands of Manchester&quot;, 1973).

In 1873, Rylands converted his business into a limited company but he retained sole management of it. The extra capital from this move led to the purchase of more mills and the company entered into fresh business in many quarters of the globe. The firm, which had a capital of £2 million, became the largest textile manufacturing concern in the UK. His business made him Manchester&#x27;s first multi-millionaire. He employed 15,000 people in his 17 mills and factories, which produced 35 long tons (39 short tons) of cloth a day.

From 1857, John Rylands lived at Longford Hall, in Stretford, an Italianate mansion he built on the site of an earlier house. In 2009 the local council placed a &quot;blue plaque&quot; at the site of Longford Hall to commemorate John and Enriqueta Rylands.
He was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Curriers.

===Public works===

Rylands was retired and reserved except in the company of his friends, and always shrank from public office of any kind, although he was not indifferent to public interests. He was politically liberal in his enterprises. When the Manchester Ship Canal was mooted, and there seemed a doubt as to the ways and means for the enterprise, he took up £50,000 worth of shares, increasing his contribution when the project appeared again in danger. Rylands was a Congregationalist, with leanings to the Baptist form of faith. He was of an ecumenical spirit and hoped that sectarian differences would tend to decrease: a number of Union Chapels (including one in Stretford and two in Manchester) were supported by him. His charities were numerous but unobtrusive. Among other benefactions he established and maintained orphanages, homes for aged gentlewomen, a home of rest for ministers of slender means, and he provided a town hall, public baths, library and a coffeehouse in the town of Stretford, where he lived. He also built an institute for the benefit of the villagers of Havenstreet on the Isle of Wight, where Rylands passed some of his later years from 1882, having built a house named Longford there after his mainland estate. His donations to the poor of Rome were so generous as to induce the king to decorate him in 1880 with the Order of the Crown of Italy.

For many years he employed the Rev. F. Bugby, John Gaskin, and other competent scholars to prepare special editions of the Bible and religious works which he printed for free distribution. These included: 
#&quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, arranged in numbered paragraphs, 1863, 4to, 1272 pages, with an excellent index in a separate volume of 277 pages. Two subsequent editions were printed in 1878 and 1886.
#&quot;Diodati&#x27;s Italian Testament&quot;, similarly arranged and indexed, printed for distribution in Italy.
#&quot;Ostervald&#x27;s French Testament&quot;, arranged on a similar plan.
#&quot;Hymns of the Church Universal, with Prefaces, Annotations, and Indexes&quot;, Manchester, 1885, pp. 604, royal 8vo; a selection from a collection made by Rylands of sixty thousand hymns.

===Marriages and death===
He married three times: first, in 1825, Dinah, daughter of W. Raby of Ardwick, Manchester (by her he had six children, none of whom survived him); secondly in 1848, Martha, widow of Richard Carden; and thirdly in 1875, Enriqueta Augustina, the eldest surviving daughter of Stephen Cattley Tennant.

Rylands&#x27;s widow erected in Manchester a permanent memorial of her husband in the John Rylands Library, of which the famous Althorp Library, purchased by her from Earl Spencer in 1892, and Lord Crawford&#x27;s manuscripts, purchased by her in 1901, form part of the contents. The library was inaugurated on 6 October 1899, when Mrs Rylands received the Freedom of the City of Manchester. The first day of opening was 1 January 1900. A posthumous grant of arms to John Rylands was obtained in 1893 in which the arms of Tennant are impaled with those of Rylands.

Rylands died at his home, Longford Hall, on 11 December 1888, at the age of 87. He was buried in the Southern Cemetery, Manchester: a fine tomb was erected over the vault and his widow was buried there in 1908. The tomb was designed by C. H. Heathcote and completed in 1892. The elaborate superstructure of the tomb which included four angels was taken down in 1927 after it was vandalised and the bronze railings were stolen in 1967.

The tomb has several Bible texts inscribed upon it which reflect his deep Christian faith:
1. &quot;Redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.&quot; (1 Peter 1:18-19)
2. &quot;They shall be mine saith the Lord of Hosts In that day when I make up my jewels.&quot; (Malachi 3:17)
3. &quot;Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.&quot; (Jude 1:21)
4. &quot;Kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.&quot; (1 Peter 1:5)
5. &quot;The Lord stood with me and strengthened me.&quot; (2 Timothy 4:17).
6. &quot;Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit serving the Lord.&quot; (Romans 12:11).

His estate, the bulk of which was left to his wife Enriqueta, was valued at £2,574,922 (£ as of ), greater than that left by any other cotton manufacturer to that time.

<text>Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann (; 2 October 1826 – 24 March 1899) was a German physicist and scientific author.

==Life==
Wiedemann was born in Berlin the son of a merchant who died two years later. Following the death of his mother in 1842, he lived with his grandparents.

After attending a private school as well as the Cölnische Humanistische Gymnasium, he entered the University of Berlin in 1844 where took his doctor&#x27;s degree three years later under the supervision of Heinrich Gustav Magnus. His thesis on that occasion was devoted to a question in organic chemistry, for he held the opinion that the study of chemistry is an indispensable preliminary to the pursuit of physics, which was his ultimate aim. In Berlin he made the acquaintance of Hermann von Helmholtz at the house of Heinrich Gustav Magnus and was one of the founders of the Berlin Physical Society.

In 1854 he left Germany to take on the role of Professor of Physics in Basel, nine years later he moved to Braunschweig and in 1866 to Karlsruhe. In 1871 he accepted the chair of physical chemistry at Leipzig. The attention he had paid to chemistry in the earlier part of his career enabled him to hold his own in this position, but he found his work more congenial when in 1887 he was transferred to the professorship of physics. With Rudolph Franz, Wiedemann developed the Wiedemann–Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductivity in 1853.

August Hagenbach was one of his students in Leipzig.

He died in Leipzig on 24 March 1899.

==Literary work==
His name is probably most widely known for his literary work. In 1877 he undertook the editorship of the &quot;Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot; in succession to Johann Christian Poggendorff, thus starting the series of that scientific periodical which is familiarly cited as &quot;Wied. Ann.&quot; Another monumental work for which he was responsible was &quot;Die Lehre van der Elektricitat&quot;, or, as it was called in the first instance, &quot;Lehre von Galvanismus und Elektromagnetismus&quot;, a book that is unsurpassed for accuracy and comprehensiveness. He produced the first edition in 1861, and a fourth, revised and enlarged, was only completed a short time before his death.

==Scientific research==
But his original work was also important. His data for the thermal conductivity of various metals were for long the most trustworthy at the disposal of physicists, and his determination of the ohm in terms of the specific resistance of mercury showed remarkable skill in quantitative research. He carried out a number of magnetic investigations which resulted in the discovery of many interesting phenomena, some of which have been rediscovered by others; they related among other things to the effect of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of the magnetic metals, to the relation between the chemical composition of compound bodies and their magnetic properties, and to a curious parallelism between the laws of torsion and of magnetism (see Wiedemann effect). He also investigated electrical endosmosis and the electrical resistance of electrolytes.

==Family==
In 1851 he married Clara Mitscherlich.

Their eldest son, Eilhard Ernst Gustav, born in Berlin on 1 August 1852, became professor of physics at Erlangen in 1886, and his younger son, Alfred, born in Berlin on 18 July 1856, was appointed to the extraordinary professorship of Egyptology at Bonn in 1892.

<text>Gmax is an application based on Autodesk&#x27;s 3ds Max application used by professional computer graphics artists. 3ds Max is a comprehensive modeling, animation and rendering package with some secondary post-production and compositing features. Gmax is much more limited due to its singular intended use—game content creation. Infrequently used tools and features, or the ones completely unrelated to creating 3D game models, were removed (these include most, if not all of the more complex rendering, materials, shaders, physics simulation, some of the more advanced geometry tools, in addition to the rendering engine), leaving the core modeling, texturing, and basic animation rigging and keyframing capabilities. In 2005, the promotional freeware software was discontinued after version 1.2. 

==Features==
Gmax&#x27;s utility can be expanded by &quot;game packs&quot; which feature customized tools that allow creation and exporting of customizable content to games and websites. As Gmax did not have its parent software&#x27;s rendering engine, game packs were typically required to provide those features when needed(Auran was the first company to write and distribute a dedicated renderer for their Trainz Railroad Simulator series Gmax gamepacks in their initial pre-production Beta Release V0.9 (2000). Thereafter Gmax was bundled with subsequentTrainz until Trainz 2009. Maxis was the second company to write a dedicated renderer for their Gmax gamepack, &quot;BAT&quot; (Building Architect Tool) for &quot;SimCity 4&quot; (ca. 2002). In both the game environments, a user can enter the virtual 3D world, interact with the environment, ride a car and sight see, or in the Trainz series of simulators - operate a carefully modeled realistic Train Locomotive, ride in an observation car, automobile, boat, airplane, or steamship.)

The introduction of Gmax and Autodesk&#x27;s distribution of the core tools was thought to be aimed towards remedying the &#x27;limited-options infringement&#x27; of 3D modeling packages that had been widespread among amateur 3D modeling and game mod communities to that point. Until the introduction of Gmax, and a similar &#x27;game modeler&#x27; version of Maya soon after, amateur modelers had extremely limited access to the tools needed for 3D artwork. Gmax enabled modelers to have legitimate access to content creation tools similar to those used by professionals.

===Redistribution===
Auran/N3V distributed Gmax from the outset as a licensed partner as an included part of the Trainz series of simulators, along with a document &quot;Content Creators&quot; manual, up through and including the release of Trainz 2004 Deluxe, after which they provided a download link in the many versions of TRS2006 before the technology became obsolescent.

Microsoft distributed Gmax with &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; (MSFS) beginning with the 2002 version. Most of the freeware and payware add-on aircraft and scenery is created with Gmax and it&#x27;s considered to be the standard modeller for MSFS, although it does have competition in the form of the more user-friendly Flight Simulator Design Studio. It can make use of special animations through XML coding written into parts.

==Cancellation==
As of October 16, 2005 AutoDesk Media and Entertainment has discontinued and no longer supports Gmax. Instead, the company has decided to focus on 3ds Max. However, the last version of Gmax is available for free to download from the official support website.

*Note: As of 2022, you can no longer download the software from Turbo Squid&#x27;s page.

==Software license agreement==
There has been some debate as to whether exporting &quot;Quake 3&quot; models for use with a game other than &quot;Quake 3&quot; is a violation of the Gmax software license agreement (or EULA). Product manager Paul Perreault has publicly stated that &quot;Gmax is a tool to create 3d content—what you create with Gmax is your business, not ours.&quot; He continues, &quot;Discreet is not opposed to exporting data from Gmax—provided Discreet is the decision maker about what formats are supported.&quot; Export to the Quake 3 model format is officially supported by Discreet. Therefore, using Gmax to create and export models to the .md3 format does not appear to be a violation of the terms of the Gmax EULA.

<doc id="475627" wikidata="Q61197" url="?curid=475627" title="Johann Christian Poggendorff">
<text>Johann Christian Poggendorff (29 December 1796 – 24 January 1877) was a German physicist born in Hamburg. By far the greater and more important part of his work related to electricity and magnetism. Poggendorff is known for his electrostatic motor which is analogous to Wilhelm Holtz&#x27;s electrostatic machine. In 1841 he described the use of the potentiometer for measurement of electrical potentials without current draw.

==Biography==
Poggendorf had apprenticed himself to an apothecary in Hamburg, and when twenty-two began to earn his living as an apothecary&#x27;s assistant at Itzehoe. Ambition and a strong inclination towards a scientific career led him to throw up his business and move to Berlin, where he entered Humboldt University in 1820. Here his abilities were speedily recognized, and in 1823 he was appointed meteorological observer to the Academy of Sciences.

Even at this early period he had conceived the idea of founding a physical and chemical scientific journal, and the realization of this plan was hastened by the sudden death of Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert, the editor of &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Annalen der Physik&quot;, in 1824 Poggendorff immediately put himself in communication with the publisher, Barth of Leipzig. He became editor of &quot;Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot;, which was to be a continuation of &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Annalen&quot; on a somewhat extended plan. Poggendorff was admirably qualified for the post, and edited the journal for 52 years, until 1876. In 1826, Poggendorff developed the mirror galvanometer, a device for detecting electric currents.

He had an extraordinary memory, well stored with scientific knowledge, both modern and historical, a cool and impartial judgment, and a strong preference for facts as against theory of the speculative kind. He was thus able to throw himself into the spirit of modern experimental science. He possessed in abundant measure the German virtue of orderliness in the arrangement of knowledge and in the conduct of business. Further he had an engaging geniality of manner and much tact in dealing with men. These qualities soon made Poggendorff&#x27;s &quot;Annalen&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;Pogg. Ann.&quot;) the foremost scientific journal in Europe.

In the course of his fifty-two years editorship of the &quot;Annalen&quot; Poggendorff could not fail to acquire an unusual acquaintance with the labors of modern men of science. This knowledge, joined to what he had gathered by historical reading of equally unusual extent, he carefully digested and gave to the world in his &quot;Biographisch-literarisches Handworterbuch zur Geschichte der exacten Wissenschaften&quot;, containing notices of the lives and labors of mathematicians, astronomers, physicists, and chemists, of all peoples and all ages. This work contains an astounding collection of facts invaluable to the scientific biographer and historian. The first two volumes were published in 1863; after his death a third volume appeared in 1898, covering the period 1858–1883, and a fourth in 1904, coming down to the beginning of the 20th century.

His literary and scientific reputation speedily brought him honorable recognition. In 1830 he was made royal professor, in 1838 Hon. Ph.D. and extraordinary professor in the University of Berlin, and in 1839 member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1845, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Many offers of ordinary professorships were made to him, but he declined them all, devoting himself to his duties as editor of the &quot;Annalen&quot;, and to the pursuit of his scientific researches. He died at Berlin on 24 January 1877.

His daughter Marie Poggendorff (born 12 August 1838) married Valentin Rose in 1872.


==Illusion==
The &quot;Poggendorff Illusion&quot; is an optical illusion that involves the brain&#x27;s perception of the interaction between diagonal lines and horizontal and vertical edges. It is named after Poggendorff, who discovered it in the drawing of Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner, in which he showed the Zöllner illusion in 1860. In the adjacent picture, a straight black line is obscured by a dark gray rectangle. The black line appears disjointed, although it is in fact straight; the second picture illustrates this fact.

<text>Jason Woliner (born June 1, 1980) is an American director, writer and a former child actor. He is best known for being in the sketch comedy show &quot;Human Giant&quot;, as a non-performing member who instead worked behind the scenes as director. Woliner won a Golden Globe award for directing &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Woliner attended Pelham Memorial High School and for higher study at Sarah Lawrence College from 1998 to 2000 before dropping out to pursue a directing career. His first acting credit was at age nine, appearing in Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s.

==Career==
After leaving school, Woliner began making films and videos, both on his own and with comedians in New York, which led to the formation of Human Giant. The first three Human Giant videos (&quot;Shutterbugs&quot;, &quot;Illusionators&quot;, and the &quot;Shittiest Mixtape Boombox Blast&quot;) caught the eyes of executives at MTV, who offered the group a pilot. The show ran for two seasons.

He was the non-performing member of the comedy group Human Giant and directed the bulk of their output. After that, he directed, co-wrote, and acted as showrunner on the cult Adult Swim series &quot;Eagleheart&quot; starring Chris Elliott. Woliner has directed episodes of Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, and Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Nathan for You&quot; and &quot;Jon Benjamin Has a Van&quot;, among others. In 2020, he directed &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;.

He has collaborated with writer-performer Brett Gelman on a series of horror/comedy specials for Adult Swim. The first of these, titled &quot;Dinner with Friends with Brett Gelman and Friends&quot;, aired in April 2014, and the second special, titled &quot;Dinner with Family with Brett Gelman and Brett Gelman&#x27;s Family&quot;, aired in February 2015. The third special, &quot;Brett Gelman&#x27;s Dinner in America&quot;, aired in July 2016. Woliner and Gelman wrote the specials together; Gelman stars and Woliner directed.

In 2020, he directed the comedy film &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, and won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture with Sacha Baron Cohen. In 2023, Woliner directed &quot;Paul T. Goldman&quot;, a hybrid documentary-comedy series for Peacock.

<text>The palm cockatoo (&quot;Probosciger aterrimus&quot;), also known as the goliath cockatoo or great black cockatoo, is a large, smoky-grey/black parrot of the cockatoo family native to New Guinea, the Aru Islands and the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia. It has a crest of long feathers atop its head, with a very large and strong, sharply-hooked black beak (with which it can easily open nuts and seeds), and prominent bright-red cheek patches.

==Taxonomy==
The palm cockatoo was formally described in 1788 by naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, in which he classified the bird with other parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus aterrimus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;black cockatoo&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1764 by English naturalist George Edwards. Joan Gideon Loten had provided Edwards with a drawing of the bird by the Sri Lankan artist Pieter Cornelis de Bevere; the original drawing by de Bere is in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. 

The palm cockatoo is, now, the only species within the genus &quot;Probosciger&quot; that was introduced by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The generic name combines the Latin &quot;proboscis&quot; (meaning &quot;snout&quot;) with &quot;-ger&quot; (meaning &quot;carrying&quot;); the specific epithet &quot;aterrimus&quot; is Modern Latin, meaning &quot;very black&quot;. The accepted type locality is Aru Islands, rather than &quot;northern Australia&quot;.

The palm cockatoo is a member of the white cockatoo subfamily Cacatuinae. Earlier, limited genetic studies found it to be the earliest offshoot from ancestors of what have become the cockatoo family. 

&quot;Palm cockatoo&quot; was designated the official common name for the species by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The bird was also referred to as the &quot;Goliath aratoo&quot; in &quot;Wood&#x27;s Natural History&quot; (1862). It is sometimes given the misnomer &quot;black macaw&quot; in aviculture, despite the fact that macaws are New World parrots and are unrelated to the palm cockatoo (other than both birds belonging to the Psittaciformes order). Confusingly, this name was also used by early naturalists as well as Brazilian tribes to refer to the dark blue hyacinth macaw (&quot;Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus&quot;).

Four subspecies are recognised.
* &quot;P. a. stenolophus&quot; (van Oort, 1911) – Yapen (Geelvink Bay islands, northwest New Guinea) and north, east New Guinea
* &quot;P. a. goliath&quot; (Kuhl, 1820) – Raja Ampat Islands (northwest of New Guinea), Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula (northwest New Guinea) and west, central, southeast New Guinea
* &quot;P. a. aterrimus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – Aru Islands (southwest of New Guinea)
* &quot;P. a. macgillivrayi&quot; (Mathews, 1912) – south New Guinea and north Cape York Peninsula, northeast Queensland (northeast Australia)

A 2007 genetic study found little support for the above division into subspecies.

==Description==
The palm cockatoo is in length and weighs . It may be the largest cockatoo species and largest parrot in Australia, although large races of yellow-tailed black cockatoos and sulphur-crested cockatoos broadly overlap in size. It is a distinctive bird with a large crest and has one of the largest bills of any parrot (only the hyacinth macaw&#x27;s is larger). This powerful bill enables palm cockatoos not only to eat very hard nuts and seeds, but also enables males to break off thick (about ) sticks from live trees to use for a drumming display. The male has a larger beak than the female. The beak is unusual, as the lower and upper mandibles do not meet for much of its length, allowing the tongue to hold a nut against the top mandible while the lower mandible works to open it. The palm cockatoo also has a distinctive red cheek patch that changes colour when the bird is alarmed or excited.

The races &quot;P. a. goliath&quot; and &quot;P. a. stenolophus&quot; are larger than the nominate subspecies. The race &quot;stenolophus&quot; also has narrower crest feathers.

===Vocalisation===

The vocalizations of palm cockatoos are similar to those of most wild parrots, but they have also been shown to produce a variety of additional syllables in display and exchange with neighbouring individuals. These additional syllables are mainly produced by males and are often combined to form long, complex sequences. In a population in the Iron Range, 30 different syllables were distinguished. The palm cockatoos from the east have different call types from the ones from other areas, due to their long term isolation.

==Distribution and habitat==
The palm cockatoo is found in rainforests and woodlands of New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia. It can still be found near Sorong, West Papua, Indonesia, where it is sometimes seen in trees along the roads.

==Behaviour and ecology==
It has a unique territorial display where the bird (typically the male) drums with a large (i.e. up to 2.5 cm diameter, 15 cm long) stick or seed pod against a dead bough or tree, creating a loud noise that can be heard up to 100 m away. After drumming, the male occasionally strips the drum tool into small pieces to line the nest. Although this drumming behaviour was discovered over three decades ago (in 1984 by G.A. Wood), the reason why palm cockatoos drum is still a mystery. One reason could be that females can assess the durability of the nesting hollow by the resonance of the drumming. Another possibility could be that males drum to mark their territory against other males. The palm cockatoo is an unusual bird, being an ancient species and one of the few bird species known to use tools.

===Flocking===
This species normally does not appear in large numbers. They are not known to flock feed like many of the cockatoo species. Usually only one to six individuals are observed feeding together at one time. As with other large birds, both parents care for young, so seeing a breeding pair is not unusual. If these birds do congregate, it will usually happen in open woodland just after sunrise or along the rainforest edge before returning to individual roosts for the night.

===Breeding===
Palm cockatoos only lay one egg every second year and have one of the lowest breeding success rates reported for any species of parrot. Offsetting this is their very long lifespan. A male commenced breeding at 29 in Taronga Zoo in Sydney, and a female at the London Zoo was 40 when she laid her first egg in 1966. Breeding takes place inside tree hollows that look like standing pipes. Fires play an important role in the destruction and creation of nest hollows. Fires allow the colonisation of microorganisms and termites, which enter the tree and start hollowing out the inside. Cyclones are important in the final stage of nest hollow development.

Anecdotal evidence indicates a palm cockatoo reaching 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, although the oldest confirmed individual was aged 56 in London Zoo in 2000. Although longevity of captive birds is known, the lifespan of palm cockatoos that live in the wild is still unknown.

===Food and feeding===

The palm cockatoo often feeds during the early hours of the day, on a diet consisting mostly of wild pandanus palm fruits and kanari tree nuts. They have also been seen eating fruits of Darwin stringy bark and the nonda tree, as well as seeds from the cocky apple tree, beach almond and black bean tree.

=== Drumming ===
A 2023 study by Professor Robert Heinsohn from the Australian National University, has found that palm cockatoos fashion individual musical tools, in the form of wood and seed pods, to drum on trees to mark their territories and attract potential mates. These musical tools are used by the cockatoos to drum out highly personal rhythms and the tools are often highly decorated. 

==Conservation and status==

The palm cockatoo is still relatively common in Cape York, where it is nonetheless threatened by habitat destruction (particularly due to bauxite mining around Weipa) and altered fire regimens in the region. Palm cockatoos are also hunted traditionally in New Guinea. The species is currently listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In Australia, palm cockatoos were relisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on 31 October 2015 (EPBC Act List of Threatened Fauna).

==Aviculture==
This species is in high demand for the pet trade due to its unusual appearance. In early captive situations, pet owners would either feed dog kibble or generic bird seed mixture, while zoos would give them &quot;monkey biscuits&quot;. As their nutritional needs became more apparent over the years, owners have shifted to specially formulated &quot;manufactured diet&quot; pellets along with a wide variety of treats like peanuts, pecans, Brazil nuts, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, oranges, apples, grapes, pomegranate, bananas, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, broccoli, and kale. Many zoos still give them monkey biscuits to broaden their diet.

<text>The salmon-crested cockatoo (Cacatua moluccensis), also known as the Moluccan cockatoo, is a cockatoo endemic to the Seram archipelago in eastern Indonesia. At a height of up to and weight of up to , it is among the largest of the white cockatoos. The female is slightly smaller than the male on average. It has white-pink feathers with a definite peachy glow, a slight yellow on the underwing and underside of the tail feathers and a large retractable recumbent crest, which it raises when threatened, revealing hitherto concealed bright red-orange plumes to frighten potential attackers. It may also be raised in excitement or in other &quot;emotional&quot; displays. Some describe the crest as &quot;flamingo-colored&quot;. It also has one of the louder calls in the parrot world and in captivity is a capable mimic.

In the wild, the salmon-crested cockatoo inhabits lowland forests below 1000 m. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, nuts, and fruit, as well as coconuts. Some additional evidence shows that they eat insects off the ground, and pet Moluccan cockatoos have tested positive for anemia if their diets do not include enough protein.

==Taxonomy==
The salmon-crested cockatoo was formally described in 1788 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus moluccensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on those by earlier ornithologists. George Edwards had described and illustrated the cockatoo in 1751, Mathurin Jacques Brisson had described it in 1760, and the Comte de Buffon in had described and illustrated the cockatoo in 1779. The type locality is the Maluku Islands. The salmon-crested cockatoo is now one of 11 species placed in the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by Louis Pierre Vieillot. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The salmon-crested cockatoo is endemic to the Seram archipelago in eastern Indonesia, and has been introduced to the Hawai&#x27;ian island of Oahu, where a small population has become established. Although they have been observed in the wild in Puerto Rico, they are probably the result of escaped pets, and no reproduction has been recorded.

== Status in the wild ==
The salmon-crested cockatoo is an endangered species, and has been listed on appendix I of CITES since 1989, which makes commercial international trade in wild-caught birds prohibited. Trade in captive-bred birds is legal only with appropriate CITES certification. Numbers have declined due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss. During the height of the trapping of this species, over 6,000 birds were being removed from the wild per year. It has a stronghold in Manusela National Park on Seram, although even today some illegal trapping continues.

== Aviculture ==

The salmon-crested cockatoo can no longer be imported into the United States because it is listed on the Wild Bird Conservation Act. They are being bred in captivity, though. They are popular for their beauty and trainability, which makes them popular in trained bird shows.

The salmon-crested cockatoo is widely considered to be one of the most demanding parrots to keep as a pet due to their high intelligence, large size, potential noise level (some of the loudest birds in the world, with calls up to 129 decibels), and need to chew. They require a very large and very sturdy cage or aviary. Salmon-crested cockatoos are highly social, and pets can be extremely cuddly, affectionate, and gentle birds. This can lead to problems if a young cockatoo is spoiled with a great deal of attention and cuddling when young and does not get the opportunity to learn to play with toys, forage, or otherwise entertain itself.

Salmon-crested cockatoos require a great deal of attention and activity to remain healthy and well-adjusted. Attention and training from human caregivers is important in keeping them occupied, as are chewable toys and foraging toys that require them to work for their food. As with most large cockatoos, the salmon-crested cockatoo may develop health and behavioural problems such as feather-plucking and aggression if not provided with the appropriate environment, attention, and enrichment opportunities.

In captivity, the salmon-crested cockatoo has been known to live for an extremely long time, with a captive individual mentioned in a 2011 paper having lived to the age of 92 years.

== Breeding ==

Moluccan cockatoos breed once a year, usually between December and March, when vegetation growth is at its peak and food is readily available.

<text>The galah (; Eolophus roseicapilla), less commonly known as the pink and grey cockatoo or rose-breasted cockatoo, is an Australian species of cockatoo and the only member of the genus Eolophus. The galah is adapted to a wide variety of modified and unmodified habitats and is one of Australia&#x27;s most abundant and widespread bird species. The species is endemic to mainland Australia. It was introduced to Tasmania, where it is now widespread, in the mid-19th century and much more recently to New Zealand.

==Etymology==
The term galah is derived from &quot;gilaa&quot;, a word from the Yuwaalaraay and neighbouring Aboriginal languages spoken in north-western New South Wales.

==Description==
The galah is about in length, and weighs . It has a pale silver to grey back, a pale grey rump, a pink face and breast, and a light pink mobile crest. It has a bone-coloured beak, and the bare skin of the eye ring is carunculated. It has grey legs. The sexes appear similar; however, adult birds differ in the colour of the irises; the male has very dark brown (almost black) irises and the female has mid-brown or red irises. Adults are more brightly coloured than juveniles. Juveniles have a greyish breast, crown, and crest, and brown irises with whitish non-carunculated eye rings.

==Distribution and habitat==

The galah can be found throughout Australia, and is absent only from the driest areas and the far north of Cape York Peninsula. The galah has been introduced to Tasmania through anthropogenic means and there were no sightings prior to 1848. A large population expansion occurred in the 1960s following many escapees from captivity. It is common in metropolitan areas such as Adelaide, Perth, and Melbourne, and abundant in open habitats that offer at least some scattered trees for shelter. It is common in all habitats in its range except for dense forests, especially those with high rainfall.

While it is mostly found in inland areas, the galah is rapidly colonising coastal regions. The changes brought by European settlement, which have been disastrous for many species, have been highly beneficial for the galah, because of the clearing of forests in fertile areas and the provision of stock-watering points in arid zones.

The galah has been introduced to New Zealand.

==Classification==
The classification of the galah was difficult. It was separated in the monotypic genus &quot;Eolophus&quot;, but the further relationships were not clear. Obvious morphological similarities are shared between the galah and the white cockatoos that make up the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; and indeed the galah was initially described as &quot;Cacatua roseicapilla&quot;. Early DNA studies allied the galah with the cockatiel or placed it close to some &quot;Cacatua&quot; species of completely different appearance. In consequence, the ancestors of the galah, the cockatiel and Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo were thought to have diverged from the main white cockatoo line at some stage prior to that group&#x27;s main radiation; this was indeed correct except for the placement of the cockatiel. Ignorance of this fact, however, led to attempts to resolve the evolutionary history and prehistoric biogeography of the cockatoos, which ultimately proved fruitless because they were based on invalid assumptions to start with.

It fell to the study of Brown &amp; Toft (1999) to compare the previously available data with their mitochondrial 12S rRNA sequence to resolve the issue. Today, the galah is seen, along with Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo, as an early divergence from the white cockatoo lineage, which has not completely lost its ability to produce an overall pink (Major Mitchell&#x27;s) or pink and grey (galah) body plumage, while already being light in colour and non-sexually dimorphic. The significance of these two (and other) characteristics shared by the Cacatuinae had previously been explained away in earlier studies by strict application of parsimony on misinterpreted data.

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are usually recognised. Slight variation exists in the colours of the plumage and in the extent of the carunculation of the eye rings among the three subspecies. The south-eastern form, &quot;E. r. albiceps&quot;, is clearly distinct from the paler-bodied Western Australian nominate subspecies, &quot;E. r. roseicapilla&quot;, although the extent and nature of the central hybrid zone remains undefined. Most pet birds outside Australia are the south-eastern form. The third form, &quot;E. r. kuhli&quot;, found right across the northern part of the continent, tends to be a little smaller and is distinguished by differences in the shape and colour of the crest, although its status as a valid subspecies is uncertain.

== Behaviour ==
The galah is often found in flocks of 10 to 1,000 individuals. These can be mixed flocks, the members of which may include Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo, the little corella, and the sulphur-crested cockatoo. The galah readily hybridizes with all of these species (see below). Flocks of galahs often congregate and forage on the ground for food in open, grassy areas. Flocks of independent juvenile galahs will often disperse from their birth flock haphazardly. The galah feeds on seeds gathered on the ground, mainly feeding in the morning and late afternoon. Idly, it will strip leaves and bark from trees, and large flocks have been observed to kill trees through defoliation.

==Breeding==

The galah nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white, usually two to five in a clutch. The eggs are incubated for about 25 days, and the male and female share the incubation. The chicks leave the nest about 49 days after hatching.

==Lifespan==
Living in captivity, galahs have been recorded reaching up to 72 years of age when a good-quality diet is strictly followed. They socialise adequately and can engage playfully in entertainment activities to support the overall very intelligent nature of the bird. In their natural habitat, galahs are unlikely to reach the age of 20 years, falling victim to traffic, predators such as the little eagle and black and peregrine falcons, and human activities in some agricultural areas. Like most other cockatoos, galahs create strong, lifelong bonds with their partners.

==Hybrids==
The galah readily hybridizes with several species, including the sulphur-crested cockatoo, little corella, Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo, and the cockatiel. Galah x cockatiel hybrids are often referred to as &quot;galatiels&quot;. Aviary-bred hybrids of galah x Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo have been bred in Sydney, with the tapered wings of the galah and the crest and colours of the Major Mitchell&#x27;s, as well as the plaintive cry of the latter.

==Relationship to humans==
In the state of South Australia, galahs are considered &quot;unprotected native fauna&quot; and may be shot (without a permit), trapped or gassed (with a permit) by landowners.

===Aviculture===
The galah is very common as a companion parrot or avicultural specimen around the world. They are generally absent from Australian aviaries, although permits are available in South Australia to take a limited number of galahs from the wild per year for avicultural purposes. When tame, it can be an affectionate and friendly bird that can learn to talk, as well as mimic other sounds heard in its environment. While it is a noisy bird that may be unsuitable for apartment living, it is comparatively quieter than other cockatoo species. Like most parrots, the galah requires plenty of exercise and play time out of its cage as well as several hours of daily social interaction with humans or other birds in order to thrive in captivity. It may also be prone to obesity if not provided with a suitable, nutritionally-balanced diet. The World Parrot Trust recommends that captive galahs should be kept in an aviary with a minimum length of 7 metres.

The breeding requirements include the use of upright or tilted logs with a hollow some twenty to thirty centimetres in diameter. Sand and finer grades of wood material are used to construct their nest, the availability of eucalypt leaves for the nest lining is also suggested for captive breeding.

===As food===
The galah has historically been eaten by humans. Galah meat recipes were published in Australian newspapers in the 1930s, alongside jokes about the alleged toughness and unpalatable nature of the bird&#x27;s flesh.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Galah&quot; is also derogatory Australian slang, synonymous with &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;clown&quot;, or &quot;idiot&quot;. Because of the bird&#x27;s distinctive bright pink colour, it is also used for gaudy dress. A detailed description of the Australian slang term can be found in the standup comedy performance of Paul Hogan, titled &quot;Stand Up Hoges&quot;. Another famous user of the slang &quot;galah&quot; is Alf Stewart from &quot;Home and Away&quot;, who is often heard saying &quot;Flaming galah!&quot; when he is riled by somebody.

The Australian representative team of footballers who played a series of test matches of international rules football against Irish sides in the late 1960s adopted the nickname &quot;The Galahs&quot; after a disparaging reference to their uniform.

&quot;Angry Birds&quot; includes a pink bird named Stella that is intended to be based on a galah.

<doc id="475659" wikidata="Q44318" url="?curid=475659" title="Heinrich Gustav Magnus">
<text>Heinrich Gustav Magnus (; 2 May 1802 – 4 April 1870) was a German experimental scientist. His training was mostly in chemistry but his later research was mostly in physics. He spent the great bulk of his career at the University of Berlin, where he is remembered for his laboratory teaching as much as for his original research. He did not use his first given name, and was known throughout his life as Gustav Magnus.

==Education==
Magnus was born in Berlin to a Jewish family, his father a wealthy merchant. In his youth he received private instruction in mathematics and natural science. At the University of Berlin he studied chemistry and physics, 1822–27, and obtained a doctorate for a dissertation on tellurium in 1827. His doctoral adviser was Eilhard Mitscherlich. He then went to Stockholm for a year as a visiting research fellow at the laboratory of Jöns Jakob Berzelius (who was a personal friend of Mitscherlich). That was followed by a year in Paris at the laboratory of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. Therefore, he had a first-rate education in experimental science when in 1831 he was appointed lecturer in physics and technology at the University of Berlin. In 1834 he became assistant professor, and in 1845 was appointed full professor, and later he was elected the dean of the faculty.

==Teaching==
As a teacher at the University of Berlin his success was rapid and extraordinary. His lucid style and the perfection of his experimental demonstrations drew to his lectures a crowd of enthusiastic scholars, on whom he impressed the importance of applied science; and he further found time to hold weekly colloquies on physical questions at his house with a small circle of young students. Furthermore, Magnus&#x27;s laboratory was one of the best equipped in the world during the years when he was professor in Berlin, and especially during the decade of the 1840s. This was as a result of his inherited money, his focus on experiment in chemistry and physics, his knowledge of the state-of-the-art methods, the scarcity of other laboratories in Europe at the time, and finally the high value he placed on facilitating the researches of up-and-coming young scientists. Well-known names in the history of physics who were beneficiaries of Magnus&#x27;s laboratory in the 1840s include Rudolf Clausius, Hermann Helmholtz and Gustav Wiedemann. Magnus&#x27;s laboratory, which he privately owned, was integrated into the University of Berlin.

==Research==
Magnus published 84 papers in research journals. His research output was continuous over his lifetime: the first memoir was published in 1825 when he was still a student, and the last appeared shortly after his death in 1870. From 1825 to 1833, he was occupied mainly with chemical researches. These resulted in the discovery of the first of the platino-ammonium class of compounds (see Magnus&#x27;s green salt). He was first to identify the three sulfonic acids sulphovinic acid, ethionic acid and isethionic acid and their salts; and, in cooperation with CF Ammermüller, of per-iodic acid and its salts. He also reported on the diminution in density produced in garnet and vesuvianite by melting (1831). Subjects on which he published research after 1833 include: the absorption of gases in blood (1837–1845); the expansion of gases by heat (1841–1844); the vapour pressures of water and various solutions (1844–1854); thermoelectricity (1851); electrolysis of metallic salts in solution (1857); electromagnetic induction of currents (1858–1861); absorption and conduction of heat in gases (1860s); polarization of heat (1866–1868); and the deflection of projectiles from firearms (see Magnus effect). From 1861, he devoted much attention to the question of diathermancy in gases and vapours, especially to the behaviour in this respect of dry and moist air, and to the thermal effects produced by the condensation of moisture on solid surfaces. Magnus was an experimenter, not a theoretician.

==Other activities==
His great reputation led to his being entrusted by the government with several missions; e.g. in 1865 he represented Prussia in the conference called at Frankfurt am Main to introduce a uniform metric system of weights and measures into Germany. He married in 1840 Bertha Humblot, of a French Huguenot family settled in Berlin, by whom he left a son and two daughters.

<doc id="475663" wikidata="Q463135" url="?curid=475663" title="White cockatoo">
<text>The white cockatoo (Cacatua alba), also known as the umbrella cockatoo, is a medium-sized all-white cockatoo endemic to tropical rainforest on islands of Indonesia. When surprised, it extends a large and striking head crest, which has a semicircular shape (similar to an umbrella, hence the alternative name). The wings and tail have a pale yellow or lemon color which is exposed when they fly. It is similar to other species of white cockatoo such as yellow-crested cockatoo, sulphur-crested cockatoo, and salmon-crested cockatoo, all of which have yellow, orange or pink crest feathers instead of white.

==Names==
The white cockatoo is known as ayab (plural form: ayot) in the Burmeso language of Papua, Indonesia.

== Taxonomy ==

The white cockatoo was first described in 1776 by German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller. Its species name &quot;alba&quot; is a feminine form of the Latin adjective &quot;albus&quot; for &quot;white&quot;. It lies in the subgenus &quot;Cacatua&quot; within the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot;. The term &quot;white cockatoo&quot; has also been applied as a group term to members of the subgenus &quot;Cacatua&quot;, the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; as well as larger groups including the pink cockatoo and the galah cockatoo.

== Description ==

The white cockatoo is around long, and weighs about for small females and up to for big males. The male white cockatoo usually has a broader head and a bigger beak than the female. They have brown or black eyes and a dark grey beak. When mature some female white cockatoos can have reddish/brown irises, while the irises of the adult male are dark brown or black.

The feathers of the white cockatoo are mostly white. However, both upper and lower surfaces of the inner half of the trailing edge of the large wing feathers are a yellow color. The yellow color on the underside of the wings is most notable because the yellow portion of the upper surface of the feather is covered by the white of the feather immediately medial (nearer to the body) and above. Similarly, areas of larger tail feathers that are covered by other tail feathers – and the innermost covered areas of the larger crest feathers – are yellow. Short white feathers grow from and closely cover the upper legs. The feathers of this species and others create a powder similar to talcum powder that easily transfers to clothing.

In common with other cockatoos and parrots, the white cockatoo has zygodactyl feet with two toes facing forward and two facings backward, which enable it to grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation.

The maximal lifespan of the white cockatoo is poorly documented. A few zoos report that they live 40–60 years in captivity. Anecdotal reports suggest it can live longer. Lifespan in the wild is unknown but believed to be as much as ten years less.

== Distribution and habitat ==

&quot;Cacatua alba&quot; is endemic to lowland tropical rainforest on the Moluccan islands of Halmahera, Bacan, Ternate, Tidore, Kasiruta and Mandioli (Bacan group) in North Maluku, Indonesia. Records from Obi and Bisa (Obi group) are thought to be introductions, while a local introduced population breeds on Taiwan. It occurs in primary, logged, and secondary forests below 900m. It also occurs in mangroves and plantations including coconut and agricultural land. It remains locally common: in 1991–1992, the population was estimated at 42,545–183,129 birds (Lambert 1993), although this may be an underestimate as it was largely based on surveys from Bacan and not Halmahera where the species may have been more common.

Recent observations indicate that rapid declines are on-going, and are predicted to increase in the future (Vetter 2009). CITES data show significant harvest rates for the cage bird trade during the early 1990s. Annual harvests have declined in actual terms and as a proportion of the remaining population in recent years, but illegal trade continues and is likely to have been underestimated (S. Metz in litt. 2013)

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
Like all cockatoos, the white cockatoo nests in hollows of large trees. Its eggs are white and there are usually two in a clutch. During the incubation period – about 28 days – both the female and male incubate the eggs. The larger chick becomes dominant over the smaller chick and takes more of the food. The chicks leave the nest about 84 days after hatching. and are independent in 15–18 weeks.

Juveniles reach sexual maturity in 3–4 years. As part of the courtship behavior, the male ruffles his feathers, spreads his tail feathers, extends his wings, and erects his crest. He then bounces about. Initially, the female ignores or avoids him, but – provided he meets her approval – will eventually allow him to approach her. If his efforts are successful and he is accepted, the pair will be seen preening each other&#x27;s head and scratching each other around the tail. These actions serve to strengthen their pair bond. Eventually, the male mounts the female and performs the actual act of mating by joining of the cloacae. For bonded pairs, this mating ritual is much shorter and the female may even approach the male. Once they are ready for nesting, breeding pairs separate from their groups and search for a suitable nest cavity (usually in trees).

===Feeding===
In the wild, white cockatoos feed on berries, seeds, nuts, fruit and roots. When nesting, they include insects and insect larvae. In their natural habitat, umbrella cockatoos typically feed on various seeds, nuts and fruits, such as papaya, durian, langsat and rambutan. As they also feed on corn growing in fields, they do considerable damage and are therefore considered crop pests by farmers. (BirdLife International, 2001) They also eat large insects, such as crickets (order Orthoptera) and small lizards such as skinks. Captive birds are usually provided a parrot mix containing various seeds, nuts and dried fruits and vegetables. Additionally, they need to be offered many fresh vegetables, fruits and branches (with leaves) for chewing and entertainment.

==Conservation status==
The white cockatoo is considered Endangered by the IUCN. Its numbers in the wild have declined owing to capture for the cage bird trade and habitat loss. It is listed in appendix II of the CITES list which gives it protection by restricting export and import of wild-caught birds. BirdLife International indicates that catch quotas issued by the Indonesian government were &#x27;exceeded by up to 18 times in some localities&#x27; in 1991, with at least 6,600 umbrella cockatoos being taken from the wild by trappers – although fewer birds have been taken from the wild in recent years, both in numerical terms and when taken as a proportion of the entire population. RSPCA supported surveys by the Indonesian NGO ProFauna suggest that significant levels of trade in wild-caught white cockatoos still occur, with 200+ taken from the wild in north Halmahera in 2007. Approximately 40% of the parrots (white cockatoo, chattering lory, violet-necked lory and eclectus parrot) caught in Halmahera are smuggled to the Philippines, while approximately 60% go to the domestic Indonesian trade, especially via bird markets in Surabaya and Jakarta.

The illegal trade of protected parrots violates Indonesian Act Number 5, 1990 (a wildlife law concerning Natural Resources and the Ecosystems Conservations).
==History==
They were quite popular in China during the Tang dynasty, a fact which in turn influenced the depictions of Guan Yin with a white parrot. The Fourth Crusade was also sealed between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and the Sultan of Babylon in 1229 with a gift of a white cockatoo.

<text>Canary Wharf is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Canary Wharf in East London. Located next to One Canada Square and between two parts of a shopping centre (Cabot Place), it serves the Canary Wharf office complex. Each of its three tracks feature platforms on both sides, allowing for easy interchanges and access to surrounding buildings. The station is sheltered by a distinctive elliptical glass roof.

The station is located on the DLR between Heron Quays station and West India Quay station. Canary Wharf is presently a terminus for the Stratford-Lewisham Line and services now only run to Lewisham in peak hours. The station is shown on the Tube map as being within walking distance of Canary Wharf Underground station; however, Heron Quays DLR station is indicated as closer by around 50 metres. It is also within walking distance of Canary Wharf station on the Elizabeth line, although West India Quay DLR and Poplar DLR stations are considered to be closer.

==History==

Canary Wharf station had been part of the original DLR plans, but when the system opened in August 1987 the station was not ready. It was originally planned that the station would be similar to the original station at Heron Quays, with two small platforms either side of the tracks. It soon became apparent that the Canary Wharf development would produce demand well above the capacity of a simple station. On 17 July 1987 (over a month before the DLR opened to the public) a contract was awarded to GEC-Mowlem Railway Group to rebuild the station into the considerably more elaborate and spacious design that exists today. It was opened in November 1991.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Canary Wharf is:
* 12 tph to 
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Off-peak, the 12 tph service to and from Stratford terminates at Canary Wharf.

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 38 tph in each direction. This includes the service between Bank and Lewisham being increased to up to 22 tph in each direction, and the service to and from Stratford being increased to up to 16 tph, with up to 8 tph being extended beyond Canary Wharf to and from Lewisham.



==Connections==
London Buses routes 135, 277, D3, D7, D8 and night routes N277 and N550 serve the station.

<doc id="475671" wikidata="Q511054" url="?curid=475671" title="Griot">
<text>A griot (; ; Manding: &#x27; or &#x27; (in N&#x27;Ko: , or in French spelling); also spelt Djali; or &#x27; / &#x27;; ) is a West African historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet, and/or musician.

Instead of writing history books, oral historians tell stories of the past that they have memorized. Sometimes there are families of historians, and the oral histories are passed down from one generation to the next. Telling a story out loud allows the speaker to use poetic and musical conventions that entertain an audience. This has contributed to many oral histories surviving for hundreds of years without being written down.

The griot is a repository of oral tradition and is often seen as a leader due to their position as an advisor to members of the royal family. As a result of the former of these two functions, they are sometimes called bards. They also act as mediators in disputes.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The word may derive from the French transliteration &quot;&quot;guiriot&quot; of the Portuguese word &quot;criado&quot;&quot;, or the masculine singular term for &quot;servant.&quot; Griots are more predominant in the northern portions of West Africa.

In African languages, griots are referred to by a number of names: jèli in northern Mande areas, jali in southern Mande areas, guewel in Wolof, kevel or kewel or okawul in Serer, gawlo in Pulaar (Fula), iggawen in Hassaniyan, arokin in Yoruba, and diari or gesere in Soninke. Some of these may derive from Arabic قَول &quot;qawl&quot;- &quot;a saying, statement&quot;.

The Manding term &quot;jeliya&quot; (meaning &quot;musicianhood&quot;) sometimes refers to the knowledge of griots, indicating the hereditary nature of the class. &quot;Jali&quot; comes from the root word &quot;jali&quot; or &quot;djali&quot; (blood). This is also the title given to griots in regions within the former Mali Empire. Though the term &quot;griot&quot; is more common in English, some, such as poet Bakari Sumano, prefer the term &quot;jeli&quot;.

Today, the term and spelling &quot;djali&quot; is often preferred, as noted by American poet Amiri Baraka and Congolese filmmaker Balufu Bakupa-Kanyinda.

==Role==
Historically, Griots form an endogamous professionally specialised group or caste, meaning that most of them only marry fellow griots, and pass on the storytelling tradition down the family line. In the past, a family of griots would accompany a family of kings or emperors, who were superior in status to the griots. All kings had griots, and all griots had kings, and most villages also had their own griot. A village griot would relate stories of topics including births, deaths, marriages, battles, hunts, affairs, and other life events.

Griots have the main responsibility for keeping stories of the individual tribes and families alive in the oral tradition, with the narrative accompanied by a musical instrument. They are an essential part of many West African events such as weddings, where they sing and share family history of the bride and groom. It is also their role to settle disputes and act as mediator in case of conflicts. Respect for and familiarity with the griot meant that they could approach both parties without being attacked, and initiate peace negotiations between the hostile parties.

Francis Bebey writes about the griot in &quot;African Music, A People&#x27;s Art&quot;:

==In the Mali Empire==
The Mali Empire (Malinke Empire), at its height in the middle of the 14th century, extended from central Africa (today&#x27;s Chad and Niger) to West Africa (today&#x27;s Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal). The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita, whose exploits remain celebrated in Mali today. In the &quot;Epic of Sundiata&quot;, Naré Maghann Konaté offered his son Sundiata Keita a griot, Balla Fasséké, to advise him in his reign. Balla Fasséké is considered the founder of the Kouyaté line of griots that exists to this day.

Each aristocratic family of griots accompanied a higher-ranked family of warrior-kings or emperors, called &quot;jatigi&quot;. In traditional culture, no griot can be without a &quot;jatigi&quot;, and no &quot;jatigi&quot; can be without a griot. However, the &quot;jatigi&quot; can loan his griot to another jatigi.

==In Mande society==
In many Mande societies, the &quot;jeli&quot; was a historian, advisor, arbitrator, praise singer (patronage), and storyteller. They essentially served as history books, preserving ancient stories and traditions through song. Their tradition was passed down through generations. The name &quot;jeli&quot; means &quot;blood&quot; in Manika language. They were believed to have deep connections to spiritual, social, or political powers. Speech was believed to have power in its capacity to recreate history and relationships.

Despite the authority of griots and the perceived power of their songs, griots are not treated as positively in West Africa as may be assumed. Thomas A. Hale wrote, &quot;Another [reason for ambivalence towards griots] is an ancient tradition that marks them as a separate people categorized all too simplistically as members of a &#x27;caste&#x27;, a term that has come under increasing attack as a distortion of the social structure in the region. In the worst case, that difference meant burial for griots in trees rather than in the ground in order to avoid polluting the earth (Conrad and Frank 1995:4-7). Although these traditions are changing, griots and people of griot heritage still find it difficult to marry outside of their social group.&quot; This discrimination is now deemed illegal.

==Musical instruments used by griots==
In addition to being singers and social commentators, griots are often skilled instrumentalists. Their instruments include stringed instruments like the kora, the khalam (or xalam), the ngoni, the kontigi, and the goje (or n&#x27;ko in the Mandinka language). Other instruments include the balafon, and the junjung.

The kora is a long-necked lute-like instrument with 21 strings. The xalam is a variation of the kora, and usually consists of fewer than five strings. Both have gourd bodies that act as resonator. The ngoni is also similar to these two instruments, with five or six strings. The balafon is a wooden xylophone, while the goje is a stringed instrument played with a bow, much like a fiddle.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: &quot;West African plucked lutes such as the &quot;konting&quot;, &quot;khalam&quot;, and the &quot;nkoni&quot; (which was noted by Ibn Baṭṭūṭah in 1353) may have originated in ancient Egypt. The &quot;khalam&quot; is claimed to be the ancestor of the banjo. Another long-necked lute is the &quot;ramkie&quot; of South Africa.&quot;
Griots also wrote stories that children enjoyed listening to. These stories were passed down to their children.

==Present-day griots==
Many griots today live in many parts of West Africa and are present among the Mande peoples (Mandinka or Malinké, Bambara, Bwaba, Bobo, Dyula,Soninke etc.), Fulɓe (Fula), Hausa, Songhai, Tukulóor, Wolof, Serer, Mossi, Dagomba, Mauritanian Arabs, and many other smaller groups. There are other griots who have left their home country for another such as the United States or France and still maintain their role as a griot.

Today, performing is one of the most common functions of a griot. Their range of exposure has widened, and many griots now travel internationally to sing and play the kora or other instruments. 

Bakari Sumano, head of the Association of Bamako Griots in Mali from 1994 to 2003, was an internationally known advocate for the significance of the griot in West African society.

Pape Demba &quot;Paco&quot; Samb, a Senegalese griot of Wolof ancestry, is based in Delaware and performs in the United States. Circa 2013, he performed in charity concerts for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages in Chicago. As of 2023, Paco leads McDaniel College&#x27;s Student African Drum Ensemble. His own band is titled the Super Ngewel Emsemble. Concerning the goals of modern-day griot, Paco has stated:If you are griot, you have to flow your history and your family, because we have such a long history. You have to be traditional and share your culture. Any country you go to, you share your family with them.

Malian novelist Massa Makan Diabaté was a descendant and critic of the griot tradition. Though Diabaté argued that griots &quot;no longer exist&quot; in the classic sense, he believed the tradition could be salvaged through literature. His fiction and plays blend traditional Mandinka storytelling and idiom with Western literary forms.
