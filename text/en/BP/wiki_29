<text>Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is a family of wireless broadband communication standards based on the IEEE 802.16 set of standards, which provide physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) options.

The WiMAX Forum was formed in June 2001 to promote conformity and interoperability, including the definition of system profiles for commercial vendors. The forum describes WiMAX as &quot;a standards-based technology enabling the delivery of last mile wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL&quot;.

WiMAX was initially designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates, with the 2011 update providing up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. IEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced was a candidate for 4G, in competition with the LTE Advanced standard. WiMAX release 2.1, popularly branded as WiMAX 2+, is a backwards-compatible transition from previous WiMAX generations. It is compatible and interoperable with TD-LTE. Newer versions, still backward compatible, include WiMAX release 2.2 (2014) and WiMAX release 3 (2021, adds interoperation with 5G NR).

== Terminology ==
WiMAX refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.16 family of wireless-networks standards ratified by the WiMAX Forum. (Similarly, Wi-Fi refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standards certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance.) WiMAX Forum certification allows vendors to sell fixed or mobile products as WiMAX certified, thus ensuring a level of interoperability with other certified products, as long as they fit the same profile.

The original IEEE 802.16 standard (now called &quot;Fixed WiMAX&quot;) was published in 2001.
WiMAX adopted some of its technology from WiBro, a service marketed in Korea.

Mobile WiMAX (originally based on 802.16e-2005) is the revision that was deployed in many countries and is the basis for future revisions such as 802.16m-2011.

WiMAX was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wi-Fi on steroids&quot; and can be used for a number of applications including broadband connections, cellular backhaul, hotspots, etc. It is similar to Long-range Wi-Fi, but it can enable usage at much greater distances.

== Uses of WiMAX ==
The scalable physical layer architecture that allows for data rate to scale easily with available channel bandwidth and range of WiMAX make it suitable for the following potential applications:

* Providing portable mobile broadband connectivity across cities and countries through various devices.
* Providing a wireless alternative to cable and digital subscriber line (DSL) for &quot;last mile&quot; broadband access.
* Providing data, telecommunications (VoIP) and IPTV services (triple play).
* Providing Internet connectivity as part of a business continuity plan.
* Smart grids and metering.

=== Internet access ===
WiMAX can provide at-home or mobile Internet access across whole cities or countries. In many cases, this has resulted in competition in markets which typically only had access through an existing incumbent DSL (or similar) operator.

Additionally, given the relatively low costs associated with the deployment of a WiMAX network (in comparison with 3G, HSDPA, xDSL, HFC or FTTx), it is now economically viable to provide last-mile broadband Internet access in remote locations.

=== Middle-mile backhaul to fiber networks ===
Mobile WiMAX was a replacement candidate for cellular phone technologies such as GSM and CDMA, or can be used as an overlay to increase capacity. Fixed WiMAX is also considered as a wireless backhaul technology for 2G, 3G, and 4G networks in both developed and developing nations.

In North America, backhaul for urban operations is typically provided via one or more copper wire line connections, whereas remote cellular operations are sometimes backhauled via satellite. In other regions, urban and rural backhaul is usually provided by microwave links. (The exception to this is where the network is operated by an incumbent with ready access to the copper network.) WiMAX has more substantial backhaul bandwidth requirements than legacy cellular applications. Consequently, the use of wireless microwave backhaul is on the rise in North America and existing microwave backhaul links in all regions are being upgraded. Capacities of between 34 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s are routinely being deployed with latencies in the order of 1 ms.

In many cases, operators are aggregating sites using wireless technology and then presenting traffic on to fiber networks where convenient. WiMAX in this application competes with microwave radio, E-line and simple extension of the fiber network itself.

=== Triple-play ===
WiMAX directly supports the technologies that make triple-play service offerings possible (such as quality of service and multicast). These are inherent to the WiMAX standard rather than being added on as carrier Ethernet is to Ethernet.

On May 7, 2008, in the United States, Sprint Nextel, Google, Intel, Comcast, Bright House, and Time Warner announced a pooling of an average of 120 MHz of spectrum and merged with Clearwire to market the service. The new company hoped to benefit from combined services offerings and network resources as a springboard past its competitors. The cable companies were expected to provide media services to other partners while gaining access to the wireless network as a Mobile virtual network operator to provide triple-play services.

Some wireless industry analysts, such as Ken Dulaney and Todd Kort at Gartner, were skeptical how the deal would work out: Although fixed-mobile convergence had been a recognized factor in the industry, prior attempts to form partnerships among wireless and cable companies had generally failed to lead to significant benefits for the participants. Other analysts at IDC favored the deal, pointing out that as wireless progresses to higher bandwidth, it inevitably competes more directly with cable, DSL and fiber, inspiring competitors into collaboration. Also, as wireless broadband networks grow denser and usage habits shift, the need for increased backhaul and media services accelerate, therefore the opportunity to leverage high bandwidth assets was expected to increase.

=== Aviation ===
The Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communication System (AeroMACS) is a wireless broadband network for the airport surface intended to link the control tower, aircraft, and fixed assets. In 2007, AeroMACS obtained a worldwide frequency allocation in the 5 GHz aviation band. As of 2018, there were 25 AeroMACS deployments in 8 countries, with at least another 25 deployments planned.

== Support for TDD and FDD ==
IEEE 802.16REVd and IEEE 802.16e standards support both time-division duplexing and frequency-division duplexing as well as a half duplex FDD, that allows for a low cost implementation.

== Connecting ==
Devices that provide connectivity to a WiMAX network are known as subscriber stations (SS).

Portable units include handsets (similar to cellular smartphones); PC peripherals (PC Cards or USB dongles); and embedded devices in laptops, which are now available for Wi-Fi services. In addition, there is much emphasis by operators on consumer electronics devices such as Gaming consoles, MP3 players and similar devices. WiMAX is more similar to Wi-Fi than to other 3G cellular technologies.

The WiMAX Forum website provides a list of certified devices. However, this is not a complete list of devices available as certified modules are embedded into laptops, MIDs (Mobile Internet devices), and other private labeled devices.

=== Gateways ===
WiMAX gateway devices are available as both indoor and outdoor versions from manufacturers including Vecima Networks, Alvarion, Airspan, ZyXEL, Huawei, and Motorola. The list of WiMAX networks and WiMAX Forum provide more links to specific vendors, products and installations.
Many of the WiMAX gateways that are offered by manufactures such as these are stand-alone self-install indoor units. Such devices typically sit near the customer&#x27;s window with the best signal, and provide:

* An integrated Wi-Fi access point to provide the WiMAX Internet connectivity to multiple devices throughout the home or business.
* Ethernet ports to connect directly to a computer, router, printer or DVR on a local wired network.
* One or two analog telephone jacks to connect a land-line phone and take advantage of VoIP.

Indoor gateways are convenient, but radio losses mean that the subscriber may need to be significantly closer to the WiMAX base station than with professionally installed external units.

Outdoor units are roughly the size of a laptop PC, and their installation is comparable to the installation of a residential satellite dish. A higher-gain directional outdoor unit will generally result in greatly increased range and throughput but with the obvious loss of practical mobility of the unit.

=== External modems ===

USB can provide connectivity to a WiMAX network through a dongle. Generally, these devices are connected to a notebook or net book computer. Dongles typically have omnidirectional antennas which are of lower gain compared to other devices. As such, these devices are best used in areas of good coverage.

=== Mobile phones ===
HTC announced the first WiMAX enabled mobile phone, the Max 4G, on November 12, 2008. The device was only available to certain markets in Russia on the Yota network until 2010.

HTC and Sprint Nextel released the second WiMAX enabled mobile phone, the HTC Evo 4G, March 23, 2010 at the CTIA conference in Las Vegas. The device, made available on June 4, 2010, is capable of both EV-DO(3G) and WiMAX(pre-4G) as well as simultaneous data &amp; voice sessions. Sprint Nextel announced at CES 2012 that it will no longer be offering devices using the WiMAX technology due to financial circumstances, instead, along with its network partner Clearwire, Sprint Nextel rolled out a 4G network having decided to shift and utilize LTE 4G technology instead.

== Technical information ==
=== The IEEE 802.16 standard ===
WiMAX is based upon IEEE 802.16e-2005, approved in December 2005. It is a supplement to the IEEE Std 802.16-2004, and so the actual standard is 802.16-2004 as amended by 802.16e-2005. Thus, these specifications need to be considered together.

IEEE 802.16e-2005 improves upon IEEE 802.16-2004 by:
* Adding support for mobility (soft and hard handover between base stations). This is seen as one of the most important aspects of 802.16e-2005, and is the basis of mobile WiMAX.
* Scaling of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the channel bandwidth in order to keep the carrier spacing constant across different channel bandwidths (typically 1.25 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz or 20 MHz). Constant carrier spacing results in a higher spectrum efficiency in wide channels, and a cost reduction in narrow channels. Also known as scalable OFDMA (SOFDMA). Other bands not multiples of 1.25 MHz are defined in the standard, but because the allowed FFT subcarrier numbers are only 128, 512, 1024 and 2048, other frequency bands will not have exactly the same carrier spacing, which might not be optimal for implementations. Carrier spacing is 10.94 kHz.
* Advanced antenna diversity schemes, and hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ)
* Adaptive antenna systems (AAS) and MIMO technology
* Denser sub-channelization, thereby improving indoor penetration
* Intro and low-density parity check (LDPC)
* Introducing downlink sub-channelization, allowing administrators to trade coverage for capacity or vice versa
* Adding an extra quality of service (QoS) class for VoIP applications

SOFDMA (used in 802.16e-2005) and OFDM256 (802.16d) are not compatible thus equipment will have to be replaced if an operator is to move to the later standard (e.g., Fixed WiMAX to Mobile WiMAX).

=== Physical layer ===
The original version of the standard on which WiMAX is based (IEEE 802.16) specified a physical layer operating in the 10 to 66 GHz range. 802.16a, updated in 2004 to 802.16-2004, added specifications for the 2 to 11 GHz range. 802.16-2004 was updated by 802.16e-2005 in 2005 and uses scalable orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (SOFDMA), as opposed to the fixed orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) version with 256 sub-carriers (of which 200 are used) in 802.16d. More advanced versions, including 802.16e, also bring multiple antenna support through MIMO. (See WiMAX MIMO) This brings potential benefits in terms of coverage, self installation, power consumption, frequency re-use and bandwidth efficiency. WiMax is the most energy-efficient pre-4G technique among LTE and HSPA+.

=== Media access control layer ===
The WiMAX MAC uses a scheduling algorithm for which the subscriber station needs to compete only once for initial entry into the network. After network entry is allowed, the subscriber station is allocated an access slot by the base station. The time slot can enlarge and contract, but remains assigned to the subscriber station, which means that other subscribers cannot use it. In addition to being stable under overload and over-subscription, the scheduling algorithm can also be more bandwidth efficient. The scheduling algorithm also allows the base station to control QoS parameters by balancing the time-slot assignments among the application needs of the subscriber station.

=== Specifications ===
As a standard intended to satisfy needs of next-generation data networks (4G), WiMAX is distinguished by its dynamic burst algorithm modulation adaptive to the physical environment the RF signal travels through. Modulation is chosen to be more spectrally efficient (more bits per OFDM/SOFDMA symbol). That is, when the bursts have a high signal strength and a high carrier to noise plus interference ratio (CINR), they can be more easily decoded using digital signal processing (DSP). In contrast, operating in less favorable environments for RF communication, the system automatically steps down to a more robust mode (burst profile) which means fewer bits per OFDM/SOFDMA symbol; with the advantage that power per bit is higher and therefore simpler accurate signal processing can be performed.

Burst profiles are used inverse (algorithmically dynamic) to low signal attenuation; meaning throughput between clients and the base station is determined largely by distance. Maximum distance is achieved by the use of the most robust burst setting; that is, the profile with the largest MAC frame allocation trade-off requiring more symbols (a larger portion of the MAC frame) to be allocated in transmitting a given amount of data than if the client were closer to the base station.

The client&#x27;s MAC frame and their individual burst profiles are defined as well as the specific time allocation. However, even if this is done automatically then the practical deployment should avoid high interference and multipath environments. The reason for which is obviously that too much interference causes the network to function poorly and can also misrepresent the capability of the network.

The system is complex to deploy as it is necessary to track not only the signal strength and CINR (as in systems like GSM) but also how the available frequencies will be dynamically assigned (resulting in dynamic changes to the available bandwidth.) This could lead to cluttered frequencies with slow response times or lost frames.

As a result, the system has to be initially designed in consensus with the base station product team to accurately project frequency use, interference, and general product functionality.

The Asia-Pacific region has surpassed the North American region in terms of 4G broadband wireless subscribers. There were around 1.7 million pre-WiMAX and WiMAX customers in Asia – 29% of the overall market – compared to 1.4 million in the US and Canada.

=== Integration with an IP-based network ===
The WiMAX Forum has proposed an architecture that defines how a WiMAX network can be connected with an IP based core network, which is typically chosen by operators that serve as Internet Service Providers (ISP); Nevertheless, the WiMAX BS provide seamless integration capabilities with other types of architectures as with packet switched Mobile Networks.

The WiMAX forum proposal defines a number of components, plus some of the interconnections (or reference points) between these, labeled R1 to R5 and R8:
* SS/MS: the Subscriber Station/Mobile Station
* ASN: the Access Service Network
* BS: Base station, part of the ASN
* ASN-GW: the ASN Gateway, part of the ASN
* CSN: the Connectivity Service Network
* HA: Home Agent, part of the CSN
* AAA: Authentication, Authorization and Accounting Server, part of the CSN
* NAP: a Network Access Provider
* NSP: a Network Service Provider

The functional architecture can be designed into various hardware configurations rather than fixed configurations. For example, the architecture is flexible enough to allow remote/mobile stations of varying scale and functionality and Base Stations of varying size – e.g. femto, pico, and mini BS as well as macros.

=== Integration with LTE and 5G NR ===
WiMAX 2.1 and above can be integrated with a LTE TDD network and perform handovers from/to LTE TDD. WiMAX 3 expands the integration to 5G NR.

=== Spectrum allocation ===
There is no uniform global licensed spectrum for WiMAX, however the WiMAX Forum published three licensed spectrum profiles: 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz, in an effort to drive standardisation and decrease cost.

In the US, the biggest segment available was around 2.5 GHz, and is already assigned, primarily to Sprint Nextel and Clearwire. Elsewhere in the world, the most-likely bands used will be the Forum approved ones, with 2.3 GHz probably being most important in Asia. Some countries in Asia like India and Indonesia will use a mix of 2.5 GHz, 3.3 GHz and other frequencies. Pakistan&#x27;s Wateen Telecom uses 3.5 GHz.

Analog TV bands (700 MHz) may become available, but await the complete digital television transition, and other uses have been suggested for that spectrum. In the USA the FCC auction for this spectrum began in January 2008 and, as a result, the biggest share of the spectrum went to Verizon Wireless and the next biggest to AT&amp;T. Both of these companies stated their intention of supporting LTE, a technology which competes directly with WiMAX. EU commissioner Viviane Reding has suggested re-allocation of 500–800 MHz spectrum for wireless communication, including WiMAX.

WiMAX profiles define channel size, TDD/FDD and other necessary attributes in order to have interoperating products. The current fixed profiles are defined for both TDD and FDD profiles. At this point, all of the mobile profiles are TDD only. The fixed profiles have channel sizes of 3.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 7 MHz and 10 MHz. The mobile profiles are 5 MHz, 8.75 MHz and 10 MHz. (Note: the 802.16 standard allows a far wider variety of channels, but only the above subsets are supported as WiMAX profiles.)

Since October 2007, the Radio communication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R) has decided to include WiMAX technology in the IMT-2000 set of standards. This enables spectrum owners (specifically in the 2.5–2.69 GHz band at this stage) to use WiMAX equipment in any country that recognizes the IMT-2000.

=== Inherent limitations ===
WiMAX cannot deliver 70 Mbit/s over . Like all wireless technologies, WiMAX can operate at higher bitrates or over longer distances but not both. Operating at the maximum range of increases bit error rate and thus results in a much lower bitrate. Conversely, reducing the range (to under 1 km) allows a device to operate at higher bitrates.

A citywide deployment of WiMAX in Perth, Australia demonstrated that customers at the cell-edge with an indoor Customer-premises equipment (CPE) typically obtain speeds of around 1–4 Mbit/s, with users closer to the cell site obtaining speeds of up to 30 Mbit/s.

Like all wireless systems, available bandwidth is shared between users in a given radio sector, so performance could deteriorate in the case of many active users in a single sector. However, with adequate capacity planning and the use of WiMAX&#x27;s QoS, a minimum guaranteed throughput for each subscriber can be put in place. In practice, most users will have a range of 4–8 Mbit/s services and additional radio cards will be added to the base station to increase the number of users that may be served as required.

=== Silicon implementations ===
A number of specialized companies produced baseband ICs and integrated RFICs for WiMAX Subscriber Stations in the 2.3, 2.5 and 3.5 GHz bands (refer to &#x27;Spectrum allocation&#x27; above). These companies include, but are not limited to, Beceem, Sequans, and PicoChip.

=== Comparison ===
Comparisons and confusion between WiMAX and Wi-Fi are frequent, because both are related to wireless connectivity and Internet access.

* WiMAX is a long range system, covering many kilometres, that uses licensed or unlicensed spectrum to deliver connection to a network, in most cases the Internet.
* Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequency bands to provide access to a local network.
* Wi-Fi is far more popular in end-user devices.
* Wi-Fi runs on the Media Access Control&#x27;s CSMA/CA protocol, which is connectionless and contention based, whereas WiMAX runs a connection-oriented MAC.
* WiMAX and Wi-Fi have quite different QoS mechanisms:
** WiMAX uses a QoS mechanism based on connections between the base station and the user device. Each connection is based on specific scheduling algorithms.
** Wi-Fi uses contention access — all subscriber stations that wish to pass data through a wireless access point (AP) are competing for the AP&#x27;s attention on a random interrupt basis. This can cause subscriber stations distant from the AP to be repeatedly interrupted by closer stations, greatly reducing their throughput.
* Both IEEE 802.11, which includes Wi-Fi, and IEEE 802.16, which includes WiMAX, define Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and wireless ad hoc networks, where an end user communicates to users or servers on another Local Area Network (LAN) using its access point or base station. However, 802.11 supports also direct ad hoc or peer to peer networking between end user devices without an access point while 802.16 end user devices must be in range of the base station.

Although Wi-Fi and WiMAX are designed for different situations, they are complementary. WiMAX network operators typically provide a WiMAX Subscriber Unit that connects to the metropolitan WiMAX network and provides Wi-Fi connectivity within the home or business for computers and smartphones. This enables the user to place the WiMAX Subscriber Unit in the best reception area, such as a window, and have date access throughout their property.

== Conformance testing ==
TTCN-3 test specification language is used for the purposes of specifying conformance tests for WiMAX implementations. The WiMAX test suite is being developed by a Specialist Task Force at ETSI (STF 252).

== Associations ==
=== WiMAX Forum ===
The WiMAX Forum is a non profit organization formed to promote the adoption of WiMAX compatible products and services.

A major role for the organization is to certify the interoperability of WiMAX products. Those that pass conformance and interoperability testing achieve the &quot;WiMAX Forum Certified&quot; designation, and can display this mark on their products and marketing materials. Some vendors claim that their equipment is &quot;WiMAX-ready&quot;, &quot;WiMAX-compliant&quot;, or &quot;pre-WiMAX&quot;, if they are not officially WiMAX Forum Certified.

Another role of the WiMAX Forum is to promote the spread of knowledge about WiMAX. In order to do so, it has a certified training program that is currently offered in English and French. It also offers a series of member events and endorses some industry events.

=== WiMAX Spectrum Owners Alliance ===
WiSOA was the first global organization composed exclusively of owners of WiMAX spectrum with plans to deploy WiMAX technology in those bands. WiSOA focused on the regulation, commercialisation, and deployment of WiMAX spectrum in the 2.3–2.5 GHz and the 3.4–3.5 GHz ranges. WiSOA merged with the Wireless Broadband Alliance in April 2008.
=== Telecommunications Industry Association ===
In 2011, the Telecommunications Industry Association released three technical standards (TIA-1164, TIA-1143, and TIA-1140) that cover the air interface and core networking aspects of Wi-Max High-Rate Packet Data (HRPD) systems using a Mobile Station/Access Terminal (MS/AT) with a single transmitter.

== Competing technologies ==
Within the marketplace, WiMAX&#x27;s main competition came from existing, widely deployed wireless systems such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), CDMA2000, existing Wi-Fi, mesh networking and eventually 4G (LTE).
In the future, competition will be from the evolution of the major cellular standards to 4G, high-bandwidth, low-latency, all-IP networks with voice services built on top. The worldwide move to 4G for GSM/UMTS and AMPS/TIA (including CDMA2000) is the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) effort.

The LTE Standard was finalized in December 2008, with the first commercial deployment of LTE carried out by TeliaSonera in Oslo and Stockholm in December, 2009. Henceforth, LTE saw rapidly increasing adoption by mobile carriers around the world.

Although WiMax was much earlier to market than LTE, LTE was an upgrade and extension of previous 3G (GSM and CDMA) standards, whereas WiMax was a relatively new and different technology without a large user base. Ultimately, LTE won the war to become the 4G standard because mobile operators such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, Vodafone, NTT, and Deutsche Telekom chose to extend their investments in know-how, equipment and spectrum from 3G to LTE, rather than adopt a new technology standard. It would never have been cost-effective for WiMax network operators to compete against fixed-line broadband networks based on 4G technologies. By 2009, most mobile operators began to realize that mobile connectivity (not fixed 802.16e) was the future, and that LTE was going to become the new worldwide mobile connectivity standard, so they chose to wait for LTE to develop rather than switch from 3G to WiMax.

WiMax was a superior technology in terms of speed (roughly 25 Mbit/s) for a few years (2005-2009), and it pioneered some new technologies such as MIMO. But the mobile version of WiMax (802.16m), intended to compete with GSM and CDMA technologies, was too little/too late in getting established, and by the time the LTE standard was finalized in December 2008, the fate of WiMax as a mobile solution was doomed and it was clear that LTE (not WiMax) would become the world&#x27;s new 4G standard. The largest wireless broadband partner using WiMax, Clearwire, announced in 2008 that they would begin overlaying their existing WiMax network with LTE technology, which was necessary for Clearwire to obtain investments they needed to stay in business.

In some areas of the world, the wide availability of UMTS and a general desire for standardization meant spectrum was not allocated for WiMAX: in July 2005, the EU-wide frequency allocation for WiMAX was blocked.

=== Harmonization ===
Early WirelessMAN standards, The European standard HiperMAN and Korean standard WiBro were harmonized as part of WiMAX and are no longer seen as competition but as complementary. All networks now being deployed in South Korea, the home of the WiBro standard, are now WiMAX.

=== Comparison with other mobile Internet standards ===

The following table only shows peak rates which are potentially very misleading. In addition, the comparisons listed are not normalized by physical channel size (i.e., spectrum used to achieve the listed peak rates); this obfuscates spectral efficiency and net through-put capabilities of the different wireless technologies listed below.

== Development ==
The IEEE 802.16m-2011 standard was the core technology for WiMAX 2. The IEEE 802.16m standard was submitted to the ITU for IMT-Advanced standardization. IEEE 802.16m is one of the major candidates for IMT-Advanced technologies by ITU. Among many enhancements, IEEE 802.16m systems can provide four times faster data speed than the WiMAX Release 1.

WiMAX Release 2 provided backward compatibility with Release 1. WiMAX operators could migrate from release 1 to release 2 by upgrading channel cards or software. The WiMAX 2 Collaboration Initiative was formed to help this transition.

It was anticipated that using 4X2 MIMO in the urban microcell scenario with only a single 20 MHz TDD channel available system wide, the 802.16m system can support both 120 Mbit/s downlink and 60 Mbit/s uplink per site simultaneously.
It was expected that the WiMAX Release 2 would be available commercially in the 2011–2012 timeframe.

WiMAX Release 2.1 was released in early-2010s which have broken compatibility with earlier WiMAX networks. Significant number of operators have migrated to the new standard that is compatible with TD-LTE by the end of 2010s.

== Interference ==
A field test conducted in 2007 by SUIRG (Satellite Users Interference Reduction Group) with support from the U.S. Navy, the Global VSAT Forum, and several member organizations yielded results showing interference at 12 km when using the same channels for both the WiMAX systems and satellites in C-band.

== Deployments ==
As of October 2010, the WiMAX Forum claimed over 592 WiMAX (fixed and mobile) networks deployed in over 148 countries, covering over 621 million people. By February 2011, the WiMAX Forum cited coverage of over 823 million people, and estimated coverage to over 1 billion people by the end of the year. Note that coverage means the offer of availability of WiMAX service to populations within various geographies, not the number of WiMAX subscribers.

South Korea launched a WiMAX network in the second quarter of 2006. Spain delivered full coverage in two cities Seville and Málaga in 2008 reaching 20,000 portable units. By the end of 2008 there were 350,000 WiMAX subscribers in Korea.

Worldwide, by early 2010 WiMAX seemed to be ramping quickly relative to other available technologies, though access in North America lagged.
Yota, the largest WiMAX network operator in the world in 4Q 2009, announced in May 2010 that it would move new network deployments to LTE and, subsequently, change its existing networks as well.

A study published in September 2010 by Blycroft Publishing estimated 800 management contracts from 364 WiMAX operations worldwide offering active services (launched or still trading as opposed to just licensed and still to launch). The WiMAX Forum announced on Aug 16, 2011 that there were more than 20 million WiMAX subscribers worldwide, the high-water mark for this technology. http://wimaxforum.org/Page/News/PR/20110816_WiMAX_Subscriptions_Surpass_20_Million_Globally

<text>A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. Hats which incorporate mechanical features, such as visors, spikes, flaps, braces or beer holders shade into the broader category of headgear. 

In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers&#x27; heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer&#x27;s head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs, or the mitre worn by Christian bishops. Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the turban worn by Sikhs, or the church hat that is worn as a headcovering by Christian women during prayer and worship.

== History ==
While there are not many official records of hats before 3,000 BC, they probably were commonplace before that. The 27,000-to-30,000-year-old Venus of Willendorf figurine may depict a woman wearing a woven hat. One of the earliest known confirmed hats was worn by a Bronze Age man (nicknamed Ötzi) whose body (including his hat) was found frozen in a mountain between Austria and Italy, where he had been since around 3250 BC. He was found wearing a bearskin cap with a chin strap, made of several hides stitched together, essentially resembling a Russian fur hat without the flaps.

One of the first pictorial depictions of a hat appears in a tomb painting from Thebes, Egypt, which shows a man wearing a conical straw hat, dated to around 3200 BC. Hats were commonly worn in ancient Egypt. Many upper-class Egyptians shaved their heads, then covered it in a headdress intended to help them keep cool. Ancient Mesopotamians often wore conical hats or ones shaped somewhat like an inverted vase.

Other early hats include the Pileus, a simple skull-like cap; the Phrygian cap, worn by freed slaves in Greece and Rome (which became iconic in America during the Revolutionary War and the French Revolution, as a symbol of the struggle for liberty against the Monarchy); and the Greek petasos, the first known hat with a brim. Women wore veils, kerchiefs, hoods, caps and wimples.

Like Ötzi, the Tollund Man was preserved to the present day with a hat on, probably having died around 400 BC in a Danish bog, which mummified him. He wore a pointed cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened under the chin by a hide thong.

St. Clement, the patron saint of felt hatmakers, is said to have discovered felt when he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet, around 800 AD.

In the Middle Ages, hats were a marker of social status and used to single out certain groups. The 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran required that all Jews identify themselves by wearing the Judenhat (&quot;Jewish hat&quot;), marking them as targets for anti-Semitism. The hats were usually yellow and were either pointed or square.

In the Middle Ages, hats for women ranged from simple scarves to elaborate hennin, and denoted social status. Structured hats for women similar to those of male courtiers began to be worn in the late 16th century. The term &#x27;milliner&#x27; comes from the Italian city of Milan, where the best quality hats were made in the 18th century. Millinery was traditionally a woman&#x27;s occupation, with the milliner not only creating hats and bonnets but also choosing lace, trimmings and accessories to complete an outfit.
In the first half of the 19th century, women wore bonnets that gradually became larger, decorated with ribbons, flowers, feathers, and gauze trims. By the end of the century, many other styles were introduced, among them hats with wide brims and flat crowns, the flower pot and the toque. By the middle of the 1920s, when women began to cut their hair short, they chose hats that hugged the head like a helmet.

The tradition of wearing hats to horse racing events began at the Royal Ascot in Britain, which maintains a strict dress code. All guests in the Royal Enclosure must wear hats. This tradition was adopted at other horse racing events, such as the Kentucky Derby in the United States.

Extravagant hats were popular in the 1980s, and in the early 21st century, flamboyant hats made a comeback, with a new wave of competitive young milliners designing creations that include turban caps, trompe-l&#x27;œil-effect felt hats and tall headpieces made of human hair. Some new hat collections have been described as &quot;wearable sculpture&quot;. Many pop stars, among them Lady Gaga, have commissioned hats as publicity stunts.

== Famous hatmakers ==
One of the most famous London hatters is James Lock &amp; Co. of St James&#x27;s Street. The shop claims to be the oldest operating hat shop in the world. Another was Sharp &amp; Davis of 6 Fish Street Hill. In the late 20th century, museums credited London-based David Shilling with reinventing hats worldwide. Notable Belgian hat designers are Elvis Pompilio and Fabienne Delvigne (Royal warrant of appointment holder), whose hats are worn by European royals. Philip Treacy OBE is an Irish milliner whose hats have been commissioned by top designers and worn at royal weddings. In North America, the well-known cowboy-hat manufacturer Stetson made the headgear for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Texas Rangers. John Cavanagh was one of the notable American hatters. Italian hat maker Borsalino has covered the heads of Hollywood stars and the world&#x27;s rich and famous.

== Collections ==
The Philippi Collection is a collection of religious headgear assembled by a German entrepreneur, Dieter Philippi, located in Kirkel. The collection features over 500 hats, and is currently the world&#x27;s largest collection of clerical, ecclesiastical and religious head coverings.

== Size ==
Hat sizes are determined by measuring the circumference of a person&#x27;s head about above the ears. Inches or centimeters may be used depending on the manufacturer. Felt hats can be stretched for a custom fit. Some hats, like hard hats and baseball caps, are adjustable. Cheaper hats come in &quot;standard sizes&quot;, such as small, medium, large, extra large: the mapping of measured size to the various &quot;standard sizes&quot; varies from maker to maker and style to style, as can be seen by studying various catalogues, such as Hammacher Schlemmer.


US hat size is a measurement of head diameter in inches. It can be computed from a measurement of circumference in centimeters by dividing by 8, because multiplying 2.54 (the number of centimeters per inch) by (the multiplier to give circumference from diameter) is almost exactly 8.

<text>Trinity Sunday is the first Sunday after Pentecost in the Western Christian liturgical calendar, and the Sunday of Pentecost in Eastern Christianity. Trinity Sunday celebrates the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, the three Persons of God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

==Western Christianity==
Trinity Sunday is celebrated in all the Western liturgical churches: Latin Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, and Methodist.

===History===
In the early Church, no special Office or day was assigned for the Holy Trinity. When the Arian heresy was spreading, the Fathers prepared an Office with canticles, responses, a Preface, and hymns, to be recited on Sundays. In the Sacramentary of Gregory the Great there are prayers and the Preface of the Trinity. During the Middle Ages, especially during the Carolingian period, devotion to the Blessed Trinity was a highly important feature of private devotion and inspired several liturgical expressions. Sundays are traditionally dedicated to the Holy Trinity.

The written during the pontificate of Gregory VII list no special Office for the Sunday after Pentecost, but add that in some places they recited the Office of the Holy Trinity composed by Bishop Stephen of Liège (903–920). By others the Office was said on the Sunday before Advent. Alexander II (1061–1073), refused a petition for a special feast on the grounds that such a feast was not customary in the Roman Church which daily honoured the Holy Trinity by the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, etc., but he did not forbid the celebration where it already existed. A new Office had been made by the Franciscan John Peckham, Canon of Lyons, later Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1292).

John XXII (1316–1334) ordered the feast for the entire Church on the first Sunday after Pentecost and established it as a Double of the Second Class. It was raised to the dignity of a primary of the first class, 24 July 1911, by Pope Pius X (Acta Ap. Sedis, III, 351). Since it was after the first great Pentecost that the doctrine of the Trinity was proclaimed to the world, the feast becomingly follows that of Pentecost.

===Roman Catholicism===
In the Roman Catholic Church, it is officially known as the &quot;Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity&quot;. Prior to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, it marked the end of a three-week period during which church weddings were forbidden. The period began on Rogation Sunday, the fifth Sunday after Easter. The prescribed liturgical color is white.

In the traditional Divine Office, the Athanasian Creed (&quot;Quicumque vult&quot;) is said on this day at Prime. Before 1960, it was said on all Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost which do not fall within Octaves or on which a feast of Double rank or higher was celebrated or commemorated, as well as on Trinity Sunday. The 1960 reforms reduced it to once a year, on this Sunday.

In the 1962 Missal, the Mass for the First Sunday After Pentecost is not said or commemorated on Sunday (it is permanently impeded there by Trinity Sunday), but is used during the week if the ferial Mass is being said.

The Thursday after Trinity Sunday is observed as the Feast of Corpus Christi. In some countries, including the United States, Canada, and Spain, it may be celebrated on the following Sunday, when the faithful are more likely to attend Mass and be able to celebrate the feast.

===Lutheranism===
A distinctive feature of Lutheran worship is the recitation of the Athanasian Creed on Trinity Sunday during Matins. It may also supplant the Nicene Creed during the Mass. The Lutheran Book of Worship, Lutheran Worship, and Lutheran Service Book specify this.

===Anglicanism===
Trinity Sunday has the status of a Principal Feast in the Church of England and is one of seven principal feast days in the Episcopal Church (United States).

Thomas Becket (1118–1170) was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on the Sunday after Pentecost (Whitsun). His martyrdom may have influenced the popularity of the feast in England. This observance spread from Canterbury throughout the whole of western Christendom.

The Athanasian Creed, although not often used, is recited in certain Anglican churches, particularly those of High Church tendency. Its use is prescribed in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England for use on certain Sundays at Morning Prayer, including Trinity Sunday, and it is found in many modern Anglican prayer books. It is in the Historical Documents section of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer (Episcopal Church), but its use is not specifically provided for in the rubrics of that prayer book.

Parishes with an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship follow a calendar where Corpus Christi is observed on the following Thursday, or in some cases the following Sunday.

===Methodism===
In traditional Methodist usage, &quot;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) provides the following Collects for Trinity Sunday: 

===Dates===

Trinity Sunday is the Sunday following Pentecost, and eight weeks after Easter Sunday. The earliest possible date is 17 May (as in 1818 and 2285). The latest possible date is 20 June (as in 1943 and 2038).

==Eastern Christianity==
In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, the Sunday of Pentecost itself is called &quot;Trinity Sunday&quot; (the Sunday after Pentecost is All Saints Sunday). The Monday after Pentecost is called &quot;Monday of the Holy Spirit&quot;, and the next day is called the &quot;Third Day of the Trinity&quot;. In the Eastern practice, green is used for Pentecost and its Afterfeast.

==Bach cantatas==
Johann Sebastian Bach composed a number of cantatas for Trinity Sunday. Three of them are extant, including &quot;O heilges Geist- und Wasserbad&quot;, BWV 165, &quot;Es ist ein trotzig und verzagt Ding&quot;, BWV 176, and &quot;Gelobet sei der Herr, mein Gott&quot;, BWV 129. The cantata &quot;Höchsterwünschtes Freudenfest&quot;, BWV 194, composed for dedication of the church and organ at Störmthal, was performed again in Leipzig for Trinity Sunday, first on 4 June 1724, a shortened version in 1726, and the complete version in 1731.

<doc id="471851" wikidata="Q2141943" url="?curid=471851" title="Samba de Amigo">
<text>is a rhythm game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. The game was released in arcades in December 1999, and for the Dreamcast in 2000. A port for the Wii was also developed by Gearbox Software and Escalation Studios and released in 2008. &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; draws on Latin American culture and its gameplay involves the player using controllers shaped like maracas to match a series of patterns displayed on-screen. The music is made of primarily popular Latin music songs rather than common or traditional samba. The game also features non-Latin pop songs.

A sequel, &quot;Samba de Amigo: Party Central&quot;, which is focused more on popular music genres in general, was released on the Nintendo Switch and Apple Arcade as &quot;Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go&quot; on August 29, 2023, and on the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 as &quot;Samba de Amigo: Virtual Party&quot; on October 12, 2023.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; is played with a pair of maracas. As a song plays, the player, guided by on-screen graphics, must shake the maracas at high, middle, or low heights with the beat of the music, or occasionally must strike poses with the maracas held in various positions. The player is represented on-screen by Amigo, a Brazilian monkey. If the player does well, the scene around Amigo (usually a concert or a dance) will attract more people and become more vividly animated; if the player does poorly, characters leave and eventually all that&#x27;s left is Amigo alone, looking sad.

In the primary game mode, each player has six spots arranged in a circle on the screen: two red meaning &quot;shake high,&quot; two yellow meaning &quot;shake middle,&quot; and two green meaning &quot;shake low.&quot; Blue dots will appear in the center of this circle and move towards the spots; as soon as the blue dot touches a spot, the player must shake a maraca at that location. For example, if a blue dot touches the upper left spot, the player must shake either maraca above his left shoulder. If both maracas are shaken in that location, the player gets an &quot;Amigo&quot; bonus. Occasionally a long line of dots will flow into a spot and the word &quot;Shake&quot; appears, telling the player to continue shaking his maraca rapidly there. Sometimes, a stick-figure (named &quot;Pose&quot;) appears on the screen holding its maracas in a certain position; the player has a second or two to match the figure&#x27;s pose for points.

===Game modes===
In the original arcade game, the player is given two or three stages to play through, depending on how the options are set. Each stage has three songs to choose from. If the player does well enough on each stage, an additional Special stage is enabled, where three of the more challenging songs are made available.

In the Dreamcast port, this version of the game is playable as Arcade mode. Original mode is the same game, except that instead of being limited to three songs in each stage, the player gets to choose from any song in the game that has been unlocked. Initially, six songs are available in this mode, while more can be unlocked by playing the Arcade or Challenge modes.

The home game also adds a Party mode, with minigames such as Guacamole (pronounced and played much the same as &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot;), Strike A Pose (consisting of a long sequence of poses to make), and 1-2-Samba! (where spots must be hit in sequence - the Japanese version&#x27;s name for this minigame, &quot;Ichi Ni San-ba,&quot; is a pun on counting to three in Japanese). Also included in Party mode is the Battle game, where two players compete to score high combos and knock out their opponent, and the Couples game (known as &quot;Love Love&quot; in Japan), where two players play through a song to test their &quot;compatibility&quot;. Along with this, the home version has features which can be unlocked, such as alternate sound effects and downloadable songs.

Finally, a Challenge mode has been added, where the player is given specific goals in order to proceed through stages. These goals include having to reach a certain letter grade or to pass a certain score while playing a song. There are 25 challenges total, separated into five stages.

===Maraca controllers===
The original arcade game used red maraca controllers modeled after their in-game design. Magnetic sensors were used to determine their position. As this was an expensive process, it had to be reworked for the home version.

In the Dreamcast version, each maraca has a cord which is plugged into a bar that lies in front of the player&#x27;s feet. The bar is slightly more than two feet in length and has a sensor at each end, and each maraca has an ultrasonic transmitter mounted on its cord; this allows the system to triangulate the position of each maraca. The rattle part can be unscrewed from the top of each maraca for quieter play. Included in the box is a plastic mat with two brown footprints, which helps players properly position themselves in relation to the sensor bar.

With the exception of the &quot;Ver. 2000&quot; sequel, the maracas were never officially used for any other games, though they can be used with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; for approximate control of the player&#x27;s character. A single maraca could also be used to control the SNK produced game &quot;Cool Cool Toon&quot;.

In the Wii version, players use the Wii Remote, in combination with either the Nunchuk or another Wii Remote. Optional, unlicensed third-party maraca attachments are also available.

In a Flash version mini-game used for the promotion of the Wii version of the game, keys W, D and C, then O, J and N is used to tap the drums. The mini game also played an introductory movie showing a family playing the Wii version of the game.

==Development==
&quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; was first developed as an experimental arcade game during the time of attractive music arcade games and swiftly by a team with little experience in game development. Shun Nakamura, the game&#x27;s director, was more focused on creating a music game where players could have fun and enjoy the performance of music, instead of just playing music. The choice of maracas was inspired by how Japanese people would use maracas to add interest to karaoke performances. As the game was originally developed for the local Japanese market, Western songs that were familiar to Japanese audiences were chosen, as well as songs with rhythms that were easy for one to immerse into. The main character, Amigo, was determined based on how his cheerful personality matched the typical portrayal of monkeys, and finalized by Yuji Uekawa, the character designer for the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. The game received positive reception every time it was presented by the team, which would lead it to being ported to the Dreamcast.

== Other releases ==
===&quot;Ver. 2000&quot;===
&quot;Samba de Amigo: Ver. 2000&quot;, was released in Japan for the arcades and the Dreamcast. It is an upgraded version, and it contains 14 new songs, as well as six new downloadable songs for the home version. Whereas in the original game, there were only three songs to choose in each stage, this version allows the player to choose several. &quot;Love Love/Couples&quot; Mode, originally available only in the home version of &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, is included in the arcade version of &quot;Ver. 2000&quot;. A new character named Amiga joins the cast. She is Amigo&#x27;s sister, and wields a tambourine. In the home version, a new volleyball game replaces the original minigames. Survival mode was also added, where the player must finish as many songs in a row as they can. In addition, the Challenge mode has new goals, as well as five new secret stages that are quite difficult.

The most significant addition to &quot;Ver. 2000&quot; is the new &quot;Hustle Mode&quot;. In this mode, the player must still follow the dots and shake the maracas in the appropriate location, but this is done a lot less often. Instead, Pose appears frequently, and in addition to making the player do static poses, he will be shaking his maracas in certain patterns that the player must mimic. These patterns include either shaking one or both maracas back and forth between two of the six positions, doing a full 360° rotation starting from one position, and looping all the way back around. All the songs in the game, including the ones previously found in the first version, have both Original and Hustle Mode patterns.

&quot;Samba de Amigo Ver. 2000&quot; was announced for North American release, under the name &quot;Samba de Amigo Ver. 2001&quot;, but it was among the games that were canceled when Sega discontinued support for their console.

===Wii version===
In mid-2007, veteran developers Gearbox Software came up with the idea to port the game to the Wii console, and upon Sega&#x27;s approval, began working on the new version with Sonic Team as consultants. The default setting of the game uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to simulate the maraca-shaking from the original game, with the option to use two remotes for completely wireless play. Optional maraca-shaped attachments are also available to provide the full experience. Unlike the maraca controls of the Dreamcast version, which could detect the height at which they were shaken, the Wii sensor bar is not capable of this. Instead, the angle at which the Wii Remote is being shaken determines if high, mid or low notes are hit. The rotation of the controller also has an effect on note detection, especially when doing cross-over moves.

All the characters and stage designs from the original game return with enhanced graphics. Many of the additions from &quot;Ver. 2000&quot; that were not available to people outside Japan are included, such as Hustle Mode and the new character Amiga. A &quot;Career&quot; mode exclusive to the Wii version is included, consisting of challenges in which players must clear songs to earn various unlockables, including maraca effects and additional songs. Unique to the Wii version, new stages based on other Sega games were added, including ones based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, complete with cameos of Sonic and Ulala respectively. Nearly, but not all the songs from the original game are included. It also includes many of the songs from &quot;Ver. 2000&quot;. 23 Wii-exclusive songs were added, bringing the total to 44. The game supports Miis and displays them next to the player&#x27;s score, as well as showing two random ones in-game during stages, with their expressions changing based on performance (Bad, Medium or Good). Online leaderboards and friends lists let players post their best scores and compare them, but only when an original, player-created Mii is used. This feature cannot be used with the guest Miis.

In addition, downloadable songs were available for an extra charge. These additional songs came in download packs. The first pack included the songs &quot;I Want Candy (cover version)&quot; by Bow Wow Wow, &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; by Jet and &quot;Mambo Mambo&quot; by Lou Bega (all master tracks), and were available upon the game&#x27;s release. Download packs came in sets of three and cost 500 Wii points. A total of three download packs were released by December 2008.

&quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; was the first retail Wii title to support the &quot;pay and play&quot; portion of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, previously used exclusively by WiiWare titles.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; on their February 1, 2000, issue as being the most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month. It went on to be the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 2000 in Japan.

Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it five stars out of five, and stated: &quot;It&#x27;s different, it&#x27;s wacky, and it&#x27;s insanely fun. Just shake your Maraca&#x27;s and watch the monkey dance - that&#x27;s all you need.&quot;

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; was met with nearly universal positive reviews, garnering an 89% average at Metacritic. &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 32 out of 40. Critics praised it for its unique and addictive gameplay, while the most common criticism was how the game could not be enjoyed without the expensive Maraca controllers.

In addition, &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; won the following awards:
*E3 2000 Game Critics Awards: Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game
*1st Annual Game Developers Choice Awards: nominated for the Excellence in Audio award and for a Game Spotlight Award.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; presented &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; with its annual &quot;Best Puzzle Game&quot; and &quot;Best Game No One Played&quot; awards among console games, and nominated it in the &quot;Best Game Music&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; categories.

During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; for the &quot;Console Innovation&quot; award.

===&quot;Ver. 2000&quot;===

Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of &quot;Samba de Amigo 2000&quot; for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated: &quot;The impact of the first game may have worn off, but it&#x27;s still a blast to break out the maraca controllers and jam to Sonic Team&#x27;s latest foray. &quot;Samba!&quot;.&quot;

On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored the Dreamcast version of the &quot;Ver.2000&quot; follow-up a 30 out of 40.

===Wii version===

The game has received mixed reviews overall, ranging from mediocre to positive reception. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave the Wii version 6/10, citing &quot;the imprecise nature of the controls&quot;, while admitting that &quot;There&#x27;s still a decent amount of daft fun to be had out of this joyous little game&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the Wii version 6/10 as well. Other reviews disagreed, with &quot;WorthPlaying&quot;, saying: &quot;the controls are spot-on 95 percent of the time&quot; and rating the game an 8.5/10. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also gave the game high marks, awarding it a nine out of ten. &quot;Gamepro&quot; gave the game a four out of five.

==Legacy==
That same year, Sega released a spiritual successor named &quot;Shakatto Tambourine&quot;. It was very much the same game as &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, except played with a tambourine controller, and featuring popular J-pop music. &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; also made a comeback of sorts in the EyeToy game &quot;Sega Superstars&quot;, where player movements recorded by the EyeToy camera were recorded in place of the original maracas. A pair of &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; themed levels appeared in the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game, &quot;Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, which are played using buttons and the system&#x27;s gyroscope.

&quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; references have continued to appear in many of Sega&#x27;s other titles. The song &quot;Vamos a Carnival&quot; is featured in the MMO &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot; as the game&#x27;s lobby music every April as part of a yearly Easter event, which would later be re-instated as the BGM of the Easter lobby which appears every second half of April, as well as the Screenshot Studio. A &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;-themed level appears in &quot;Sonic Pinball Party&quot;. Additionally, Amigo appears as a playable character in &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; and its sequel &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;.

During the Nintendo Direct aired on February 8, 2023, a sequel named &quot;Samba de Amigo: Party Central&quot; was announced for the Nintendo Switch, which uses the system&#x27;s Joy-Con gesture sensors to implement the maracas controls. It is focused more on different popular music genres and was released on August 29, 2023. On June 1, 2023, a virtual reality version based on &quot;Party Central&quot; was announced during the 2023 Meta Quest Gaming Showcase. It was released on Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 as &quot;Samba de Amigo: Virtual Party&quot;. On August 1, 2023, an Apple Arcade version of &quot;Party Central&quot;, &quot;Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go&quot;, was announced to be released on the same date as the Switch version.

<text>Dextroamphetamine (INN: dexamfetamine) is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and enantiomer of amphetamine that is indicated in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It has also been used illicitly to enhance cognitive and athletic performance, as well as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. Dextroamphetamine is generally regarded as the prototypical stimulant.

The amphetamine molecule exists as two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory, or &#x27;right-handed&#x27;, enantiomer and exhibits more pronounced effects on the central nervous system than levoamphetamine. Pharmaceutical dextroamphetamine sulfate is available as both a brand name and generic drug in a variety of dosage forms. Dextroamphetamine is sometimes prescribed as the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine, which is converted into dextroamphetamine after absorption.

Side effects of dextroamphetamine at therapeutic doses include elevated mood, decreased appetite, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, headache, increased heart rate, increased wakefulness or insomnia, anxiety, and irritability, among others. At excessively high doses, psychosis (i.e., hallucinations, delusions), addiction, and rapid muscle breakdown may occur. However, for individuals with pre-existing psychotic disorders, there may be a risk of psychosis even at therapeutic doses.

Dextroamphetamine, like other amphetamines, elicits its stimulating effects via several distinct actions: it inhibits or reverses the transporter proteins for the monoamine neurotransmitters (namely the serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine transporters) either via trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) or in a TAAR1 independent fashion when there are high cytosolic concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters and it releases these neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles via vesicular monoamine transporter 2. It also shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter being an isomer of amphetamine produced within the human body. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall) was the 14th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 34million prescriptions.
==Uses==

===Medical===

Dextroamphetamine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder), and is sometimes prescribed for depression and obesity.

====ADHD====

====Narcolepsy====

===Enhancing performance===

===Recreational===
Dextroamphetamine is also used recreationally as a euphoriant and aphrodisiac, and, like other amphetamines, is used as a club drug for its energetic and euphoric high. Dextroamphetamine is considered to have a high potential for misuse in a recreational manner since individuals typically report feeling euphoric, more alert, and more energetic after taking the drug. Dextroamphetamine&#x27;s dopaminergic (rewarding) properties affect the mesocorticolimbic circuit; a group of neural structures responsible for incentive salience (i.e., &quot;wanting&quot;; desire or craving for a reward and motivation), positive reinforcement and positively-valenced emotions, particularly ones involving pleasure. Large recreational doses of dextroamphetamine may produce symptoms of dextroamphetamine overdose. Recreational users sometimes open dexedrine capsules and crush the contents in order to insufflate (snort) it or subsequently dissolve it in water and inject it. Immediate-release formulations have higher potential for abuse via insufflation (snorting) or intravenous injection due to a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile and easy crushability (especially tablets).

The reason for using crushed s for insufflation and injection methods is evidently due to the instant-release forms of the drug seen in tablet preparations often containing a sizable amount of inactive binders and fillers alongside the active d-amphetamine, such as dextrose. Injection into the bloodstream can be dangerous because insoluble fillers within the tablets can block small blood vessels. Chronic overuse of dextroamphetamine can lead to severe drug dependence, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when drug use stops.

==Contraindications==

==Adverse effects==

==Overdose==

==Interactions==
Many types of substances are known to interact with amphetamine, resulting in altered drug action or metabolism of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both. Inhibitors of the enzymes that metabolize amphetamine (e.g., CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong its elimination half-life, meaning that its effects will last longer. Amphetamine also interacts with , particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine); therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous. Amphetamine modulates the activity of most psychoactive drugs. In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants. Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of antihypertensives and antipsychotics due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of ADHD. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Amphetamine and its enantiomers have been identified as potent full agonists of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a GPCR, discovered in 2001, that is important for regulation of monoaminergic systems in the brain. Activation of TAAR1 increases cAMP production via adenylyl cyclase activation and inhibits the function of the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and serotonin transporter, as well as inducing the release of these monoamine neurotransmitters (effluxion). Amphetamine enantiomers are also substrates for a specific neuronal synaptic vesicle uptake transporter called VMAT2. When amphetamine is taken up by VMAT2, the vesicle releases (effluxes) dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among other monoamines, into the cytosol in exchange.

Dextroamphetamine (the dextrorotary enantiomer) and levoamphetamine (the levorotary enantiomer) have identical pharmacodynamics, but their binding affinities to their biomolecular targets vary. Dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than levoamphetamine. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces roughly three to four times more central nervous system (CNS) stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects.

==History, society, and culture==

Racemic amphetamine was first synthesized under the chemical name &quot;phenylisopropylamine&quot; in Berlin, 1887 by the Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu. It was not widely marketed until 1932, when the pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline &amp; French (now known as GlaxoSmithKline) introduced it in the form of the Benzedrine inhaler for use as a bronchodilator. Notably, the amphetamine contained in the Benzedrine inhaler was the liquid free-base, not a chloride or sulfate salt.

Three years later, in 1935, the medical community became aware of the stimulant properties of amphetamine, specifically the dextroamphetamine isomer, and in 1937 Smith, Kline, and French introduced tablets under the brand name Dexedrine. In the United States, Dexedrine was approved to treat narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In Canada indications once included epilepsy and parkinsonism. Dextroamphetamine was marketed in various other forms in the following decades, primarily by Smith, Kline, and French, such as several combination medications including a mixture of dextroamphetamine and amobarbital (a barbiturate) sold under the brand name Dexamyl and, in the 1950s, an extended release capsule (the &quot;Spansule&quot;). Preparations containing dextroamphetamine were also used in World War II as a treatment against fatigue.

It quickly became apparent that dextroamphetamine and other amphetamines had a high potential for misuse, although they were not heavily controlled until 1970, when the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was passed by the United States Congress. Dextroamphetamine, along with other sympathomimetics, was eventually classified as Schedule II, the most restrictive category possible for a drug with a government-sanctioned, recognized medical use. Internationally, it has been available under the names AmfeDyn (Italy), Curban (US), Obetrol (Switzerland), Simpamina (Italy), Dexedrine/GSK (US &amp; Canada), Dexedrine/UCB (United Kingdom), Dextropa (Portugal), and Stild (Spain). It became popular on the mod scene in England in the early 1960s, and carried through to the Northern Soul scene in the north of England to the end of the 1970s.

In October 2010, GlaxoSmithKline sold the rights for Dexedrine Spansule to Amedra Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of CorePharma).

The U.S. Air Force uses dextroamphetamine as one of its &quot;go pills&quot;, given to pilots on long missions to help them remain focused and alert. Conversely, &quot;no-go pills&quot; are used after the mission is completed, to combat the effects of the mission and &quot;go-pills&quot;. The Tarnak Farm incident was linked by media reports to the use of this drug on long term fatigued pilots. The military did not accept this explanation, citing the lack of similar incidents. Newer stimulant medications or awakeness promoting agents with different side effect profiles, such as modafinil, are being investigated and sometimes issued for this reason.

===Formulations===

==== Transdermal Dextroamphetamine Patches ====
Dextroamphetamine is available as a transdermal patch containing dextroamphetamine base under the brand name Xelstrym.

==== Dextroamphetamine sulfate ====
In the United States, immediate release (IR) formulations of dextroamphetamine sulfate are available generically as 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, marketed by Barr (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries), Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Wilshire Pharmaceuticals, Aurobindo Pharmaceutical USA and CorePharma. Previous IR tablets sold under the brand names Dexedrine and Dextrostat have been discontinued but in 2015, IR tablets became available by the brand name Zenzedi, offered as 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg tablets. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is also available as a controlled-release (CR) capsule preparation in strengths of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg under the brand name Dexedrine Spansule, with generic versions marketed by Barr and Mallinckrodt. A bubblegum flavored oral solution is available under the brand name ProCentra, manufactured by FSC Pediatrics, which is designed to be an easier method of administration in children who have difficulty swallowing tablets, each 5 mL contains 5 mg dextroamphetamine. The conversion rate between dextroamphetamine sulfate to amphetamine free base is .728.

In Australia, dexamfetamine is available in bottles of 100 instant release 5 mg tablets as a generic drug or slow release dextroamphetamine preparations may be compounded by individual chemists. In the United Kingdom, it is available in 5 mg instant release sulfate tablets under the generic name dexamfetamine sulfate as well as 10 mg and 20 mg strength tablets under the brand name Amfexa. It is also available in generic dexamfetamine sulfate 5 mg/ml oral sugar-free syrup. The brand name Dexedrine was available in the United Kingdom prior to UCB Pharma disinvesting the product to another pharmaceutical company (Auden Mckenzie).

==== Lisdexamfetamine ====

Dextroamphetamine is the active metabolite of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine (L-lysine-dextroamphetamine), available by the brand name Vyvanse (Elvanse in the European market) (Venvanse in the Brazil market) (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). Dextroamphetamine is liberated from lisdexamfetamine enzymatically following contact with red blood cells. The conversion is rate-limited by the enzyme, which prevents high blood concentrations of dextroamphetamine and reduces lisdexamfetamine&#x27;s drug liking and abuse potential at clinical doses. Vyvanse is marketed as once-a-day dosing as it provides a slow release of dextroamphetamine into the body. Vyvanse is available as capsules, and chewable tablets, and in seven strengths; 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, and 70 mg. The conversion rate between lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) to dextroamphetamine base is 29.5%.

====Adderall====
Another pharmaceutical that contains dextroamphetamine is commonly known by the brand name Adderall. It is available as immediate release (IR) tablets and extended release (XR) capsules. Adderall contains equal amounts of four amphetamine salts:
* One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine aspartate monohydrate
* One-quarter dextroamphetamine saccharate
* One-quarter dextroamphetamine sulfate
* One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine sulfate

Adderall has a total amphetamine base equivalence of 63%. While the enantiomer ratio by dextroamphetamine salts to levoamphetamine salts is 3:1, the amphetamine base content is 75.9% dextroamphetamine, 24.1% levoamphetamine.

<text>Anna&#x27;s hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a North American species of hummingbird named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli.

It is native to western coastal regions of North America. Until the late 20th century, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds migrated from locations as far north as Alaska and coastal British Columbia, returning south to breed in Baja California and Southern California. 

Since the 1970s, ornamental plants in residential areas along the Pacific coast and inland deserts provided expanded nectar and nesting sites, allowing the species to expand its breeding range to northern coastal regions without migrating. Year-round residence of Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds in the Pacific Northwest is an example of ecological release dependent on acclimation to colder winter temperatures, introduced plants, and human provision of nectar feeders during winter.

These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects and other arthropods caught in flight or gleaned from vegetation.

==Taxonomy==
Anna&#x27;s hummingbird was formally described and illustrated in 1829 by the French naturalist René Lesson in his &quot;Histoire naturelle des Oiseaux-Mouches&quot; from a specimen that had been collected in California. Lesson placed it in the genus &quot;Ornismya&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ornismya anna&quot;. Anna&#x27;s hummingbird is now placed in the genus &quot;Calypte&quot; that was introduced in 1856 by the English ornithologist John Gould. Gould did not explain the derivation of the genus name but it is probably from the Ancient Greek &quot;kaluptrē&quot; meaning &quot;woman’s veil&quot; or &quot;head-dress&quot; (from &quot;kaluptō&quot; meaning &quot;to cover&quot;). The specific epithet &quot;anna&quot; was chosen to honour Anne d&#x27;Essling who married the ornithologist François Victor Massena, 3rd Duke of Rivoli. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds are long with a wingspan of and a weight range of . They have an iridescent bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Their bills are long, straight, and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red, derived from magenta, to a reddish-pink crown and gorget, which can look dull brown or gray without direct sunlight, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Females also have iridescent red gorgets, although they are usually smaller and less brilliant than the male.
The male Anna&#x27;s hummingbird is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and juvenile males have a dull green crown, a grey throat with or without some red iridescence, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers.

The male has a striking reddish-pink crown and gorget, which are strongly iridescent and dependent on the angle of illumination and observation by female or male competitor birds. The iridescence results from large stacks of melanosomes in the feather barbules, occurring as layers separated by keratin. The barbules reflect incident light in the manner of partially-opened Venetian blinds, enabling the iridescence which varies the head and gorget coloration with the changing angle of light as a coloration advantage for courtship attraction and territory defense.

Male birds with elevated levels of protein in their diet have more colorful crowns and higher iridescence in their head feathers compared with male birds with low protein intake.

The male&#x27;s call scratchy and metallic is typically used as the bird perches in trees and shrubs. Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds have adapted to urban environments and are commonly seen in backyards and parks, and at feeders and flowering plants. Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds eat flying insects.

==Population and trend==
According to a 2021 estimate, there are 8 million Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds in the western United States and Canada, with the population increasing since 1970. As of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species lists Anna&#x27;s hummingbird among species of least concern.

==Distribution and habitat==
Anna&#x27;s hummingbird is found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern and central Arizona, extreme southern Nevada and southeastern Utah, and western Texas. They tend to be permanent residents within their range. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Idaho, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana, and Newfoundland.

In response to rising temperatures at low elevations during climate change in the 21st century, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds have expanded their range into the cooler summer environments of higher-altitude (up to ) mountainous terrains of California, such as the Sierra Nevada.

===Northern range expansion===
Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds have the northernmost year-round range of any hummingbird. Birds have been recorded in Alaska as early as 1971, and resident in the Pacific Northwest since the 1960s, particularly increasing as a resident population during the early 21st century. Scientists estimate that some birds overwinter and presumably breed at northern latitudes where food and shelter are available throughout winter, tolerating moderately cold winter temperatures.

During cold temperatures, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat.

While their range was originally limited to the chaparral of California and Baja California, it expanded northward to Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, and east to Arizona in the 1960s and 70s. This rapid expansion is attributed to the widespread planting of non-native species, such as eucalyptus, as well as the use of urban bird feeders, in combination with the species&#x27; natural tendency for extensive postbreeding dispersal.

In the Pacific Northwest, the fastest growing populations occur in regions with breeding-season cold temperatures similar to those of its native range. Northward expansion of Anna&#x27;s hummingbird represents an ecological release associated with introduced plants, year-round nectar availability from feeders supplied by humans, milder winter temperatures possibly associated with climate change, and acclimation of the species to a winter climate cooler than its native region. Although quantitative data are absent, it is likely that a sizable percentage of Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds in the Pacific Northwest still do migrate south for winter, as of 2017.
===Torpor===
Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of subfreezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor. 

When studied in colder temperatures at mountainous elevations, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds used torpor more frequently and for longer periods than at lower elevations.

==Behavior==
===Foraging===
This species consumes tree sap, nectar from flowers, insects, and sugar-water mixes from feeders. Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds capture flying insects or eat insects trapped in spider webs, sometimes even the spiders themselves.

===Pollination===
While collecting nectar, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird assists in plant pollination. There is evidence that Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds in flight generate an electrostatic charge that adheres pollen to their beaks and feathers, facilitating transfer of pollen grains to hundreds of flowers per day while foraging for nectar. 

Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds can shake their bodies 55 times per second to shed rain while in flight, or in dry weather, to remove pollen or dirt from feathers. Each twist lasts four-hundredths of a second and applies 34 times the force of gravity on the bird&#x27;s head.

===Locomotion===
During hovering flight, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds maintain high wingbeat frequencies accomplished by their large pectoral muscles via recruitment of motor units. The pectoral muscles that power hummingbird flight are composed exclusively of fast glycolytic fibers that respond rapidly and are fatigue-resistant.

===Song and courtship===
Unlike most northern temperate hummingbirds, the male Anna&#x27;s hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky, interspersed with buzzes and chirps, and is drawn to over 10 seconds in duration. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing an aerial display dive over their territories. When a female flies onto a male&#x27;s territory, the male rises up about before diving over the female. As the male approaches the bottom of the dive, it reaches an average speed of , which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive, the male travels , and produces an audible sound produced by the tail feathers, described by some as an &quot;explosive squeak&quot;.

===Breeding===
Open-wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Arizona make up &quot;C. anna&quot;&#x27;s breeding habitat. The female raises the young without the assistance of the male. The female bird builds a nest in a shrub or tree, in vines, or attached to wires or other artificial substrates. The round, diameter nest is constructed of plant fibers, downy feathers and animal hair; the exterior is camouflaged with chips of lichen, plant debris, and occasionally urban detritus such as paint chips and cigarette paper. The nest materials are bound together with spider silk. They are known to nest as early as mid-December and as late as June, depending on geographic location and climatic conditions.

Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds may hybridize with other species, especially the congeneric Costa&#x27;s hummingbird. These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species. A bird, allegedly collected in Bolaños, Mexico, was described and named &quot;Selasphorus floresii&quot; (Gould, 1861), or Floresi&#x27;s hummingbird. Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period, and the species was considered extremely rare.

The specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna&#x27;s hummingbird and an Allen&#x27;s hummingbird. A single bird collected in Santa Barbara, California, was described and named &quot;Trochilus violajugulum&quot; (Jeffries, 1888), or violet-throated hummingbird. It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna&#x27;s hummingbird and a black-chinned hummingbird.

==Urbanization==
In the 2017 Vancouver Official City Bird Election, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird was named the official bird of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds are non-migrating residents of Seattle where they live year-round through winter, enduring extended periods of subfreezing temperatures, snow, and high winds.

<text>This article lists the heads of state of Fiji, from the establishment of the Kingdom of Fiji in 1871 to the present day.

Currently, the head of state of Fiji is the president of the republic, appointed by the Parliament for a three-year term under the terms of the Constitution of 2013.

The current president is Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu. He was elected on 31 October 2024, and sworn in on 12 November 2024.

==Tui Viti (King of Fiji) (1871–1874)==

&quot;Note that Cakobau had been the Vunivalu (Warlord/Paramount Chief) of Bau since 1852. He had long styled himself the Tui Viti (King of Fiji), but had not been recognised as such by other chiefs, and he exercised no direct authority outside his domain of Bau until he united the country under his leadership in 1871. His ancestors, going back as far as 1770, have often – erroneously – been listed as &quot;kings&quot; of Fiji.&quot;

==British period (1874–1970)==

On 10 October 1874, Cakobau signed the Deed of Cession, that granted the British Empire sovereignty over the islands. From 1874 to 1970, the British monarch was Fiji&#x27;s formal head of state.

===Governors===

The British monarch was represented by a governor, who acted on the advice of the British government.

==Queen of Fiji (1970–1987)==

Fiji became an independent Commonwealth realm on 10 October 1970, and Elizabeth II assumed the role of &quot;Queen of Fiji&quot;.

===Governors-general===

The Queen of Fiji was represented by a governor-general, who acted on the advice of the Fijian government.

==Presidents (1987–present)==

Fiji was proclaimed a republic on 7 October 1987, upon the deposition of the Fijian monarchy following two military coups.

<text>The governor-general of Fiji was the representative of the Fijian monarch in the Dominion of Fiji from the country&#x27;s independence in 1970 until the monarchy&#x27;s deposition in 1987.

==History==

Fiji became a sovereign state and adopted an independent monarch in the Commonwealth of Nations on 10 October 1970, with Queen Elizabeth II as Fiji&#x27;s monarch. She held the title of &quot;Queen of Fiji&quot; until 1987, when the monarchy was deposed following two military coups, led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka.

The monarch&#x27;s functions were exercised in Fiji by her representative, the governor-general of Fiji.

In 1987, following the monarchy&#x27;s overthrow, the position of governor-general was abolished. The Fijian monarch was replaced with a president as head of state. With Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the last governor-general of Fiji, appointed as the first president of Fiji on 8 December 1987 after resigning from the position of the governor-general of Fiji on 15 October 1987.

<doc id="471868" wikidata="Q1599665" url="?curid=471868" title="Phelps and Gorham Purchase">
<text>The Phelps and Gorham Purchase was the sale, in 1788, of a portion of a large tract of land in western New York State owned by the Seneca nation of the Iroquois Confederacy to a syndicate of land developers led by Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham. The larger tract of land is generally known as the &quot;Genesee tract&quot; and roughly encompasses all that portion of New York State west of Seneca Lake, consisting of about .

According to the Treaty of Hartford (1786), it was agreed that the Genesee tract was owned by the Senecas, was a part of and under the jurisdiction of New York State, and that Massachusetts had the preemptive right to purchase the land from the Senecas. In other words, the Senecas could sell the land only to the owner of those preemptive rights (unless those rights were relinquished), and that those rights were owned by Massachusetts. 

In 1788, Phelps and Gorham purchased these preemptive rights to the Genesee tract from Massachusetts for about $1,000,000 (£300,000), to be paid in three annual installments. Some sources refer to this purchase of preemptive rights as the &quot;Phelps and Gorham purchase&quot;. On July 8, 1788, at the First Treaty of Buffalo Creek, Phelps and Gorham petitioned the Senecas to sell them the entire parcel, but the Senecas agreed to sell only the easternmost third of the tract, for $5000 and a perpetual annuity of $500 per year. This portion consisted of about east of the Genesee River plus the by Mill Yard Tract along the river&#x27;s northwestern bank.

Within a year, monetary values rose and, in combination with poor sales, the syndicate was unable to make the second of three payments for the land west of the Genesee River, forcing them to default on exercising the remainder of the purchase agreement. They were also forced to sell at a discount much of the land they had already bought title to but had not yet re-sold; it was purchased by Robert Morris of Philadelphia, financier, U.S. Founding Father, and U.S. Senator.

== Origins and background ==
Much of the land south of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, and west of the Hudson River, had been occupied by the Iroquoian-speaking Five Civilized Tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy before any encounter with Europeans. Archaeological evidence suggests that Iroquoian peoples lived in the Finger Lakes region from at least 1000 CE; the nations known to the colonists are believed to have coalesced after that time, and formed their confederacy for internal peace among them. 

The Mohawk were the easternmost Iroquois tribe, occupying much of the Mohawk Valley west of Albany. The Onondaga and Oneida tribes lived near the eastern edge of this region of land purchases, closer to their namesake lakes, Lake Oneida and Onondaga Lake. (Onondaga territory had extended up to Lake Ontario). The Cayuga and Seneca nations lived to the west in the Finger Lakes region, with the Seneca the westernmost tribe.

Major Iroquois towns in the Finger Lakes region included the Seneca town of &quot;Gen-nis-he-yo&quot; in present-day Geneseo, &quot;Kanadaseaga&quot; near present-day Geneva, &quot;Goiogouen&quot; (Cayuga Castle, east of Cayuga Lake), &quot;Chonodote&quot;, Cayuga town in present-day Aurora, and Catherine&#x27;s Town near present-day Watkins Glen.

The Iroquois nations had earlier formed a decentralized political and diplomatic Iroquois Confederacy. Allied as one of the most powerful Indian confederacies during colonial times, the Iroquois prevented most European colonization west of the middle of the Mohawk Valley and in the Finger Lakes region for nearly two centuries after first contact.

During the colonial era, some smaller tribes moved into the Finger Lakes region, seeking the protection of the Iroquois. In about 1720, the Tuscarora tribe arrived, having migrated from the Carolinas after defeat by European colonists and Indian allies. They were also Iroquoian-speaking and were accepted as &quot;cousins&quot;, forming the Sixth Nation of the Confederacy.

In 1753 remnants of several Virginia Siouan tribes, collectively called the Tutelo-Saponi, moved to the town of Coreorgonel at the south end of Cayuga Lake (near present-day Ithaca). They lived there until 1779, when their village was destroyed during the Revolutionary War by allied rebel forces.

The French colonized northern areas, moving in along the St. Lawrence River from early trading posts among Algonquian-speaking tribes on the Atlantic Coast; they founded Quebec in 1608. When Samuel de Champlain explored the St. Lawrence River, he claimed the region French Canada as including Western New York. The French sent traders and missionaries there, but ceded any claim in 1759 during the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which they were defeated by Great Britain.

During the American Revolutionary War, four of the six Iroquois nations allied with the British, hoping to push American colonists out of their territory. The Oneida and the Tuscarora became allies of the rebel Americans. Within each tribe, there were often members on either side of the war, as the tribes were highly decentralized. Led by Joseph Brant, a war leader of the Mohawk, numerous Iroquois warriors joined in British attacks against the rebels, particularly in the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys. They attacked and killed settlers, took some women and children as captives, drove off their livestock, and burned their houses and barns. The Iroquois resisted colonists encroaching into their territory, which roughly comprised the Allegheny, Genesee, Upper Susquehanna, and Chemung river basins. The Iroquois nations also raided American settlements in Western New York and along the Susquehanna River.

The colonists were angry and hungry for retaliation. In response, on July 31, 1779, George Washington, who was then commanding the Continental Army, ordered Gen. James Clinton and Gen. John Sullivan to march from Pennsylvania near present-day Wilkes-Barre to the Finger Lakes area of New York. The campaign involved mobilizing 6,200 Colonial Army troops, which represented about 25% of the entire rebel army at the time. Their orders were to

destroy all Indian villages and crops belonging to the six nations, to engage the Indian and Tory marauders under Brandt and Butler whenever possible, and to drive them so far west that future raids would be impossible.

Sullivan led his army on an expedition with the goal of subduing the Iroquois in the region. Although they did not kill many Natives, his forces destroyed much of the Iroquois homelands, including 40 villages such as the major Cayuga villages of Cayuga Castle and &quot;Chonodote&quot; (Peachtown) and their surrounding fields. In the area from Albany to Niagara, they emptied their winter stores, which included at least 160,000 bushels of stored corn along &quot;with a vast quantity of vegetables of every kind&quot;. These actions denied both the Iroquois and the British the food needed to sustain their war effort. The formerly self-sufficient Iroquois fled as refugees, gathering at Fort Niagara to seek food from the British. Weakened by their ordeal and famine, thousands of Iroquois died of starvation and disease. Their warriors no longer were a major factor in the war. The Continental Army took heart from their punishment of the Iroquois on the frontier.

During their advance west, Sullivan&#x27;s army took a route to New York through northeast Pennsylvania. They had to cut a new road through lightly inhabited areas of the Pocono Mountains (this trail is known today as &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Trail&quot;). When the troops returned to Pennsylvania, they told very favorable stories of the region that impressed potential settlers.

== Treaty of Hartford ==

Following the American Revolution, there were a confusing collection of contradictory royal charters from James I, Charles I, and Charles II, mixed with a succession of treaties with the Dutch and with the Indians, which made the legal situation for land sales intractable. Following the war, Great Britain ceded all its claims to the territory, including lands controlled by the Iroquois, who were not consulted.

To stimulate settlement, the federal government planned to release much of these millions of acres of land for sale. Before that could happen, New York and Massachusetts had to settle their competing claims for a region west of New York. (Massachusetts&#x27; colonial claim had extended west without end.) The two states signed the Treaty of Hartford in December 1786. With the treaty, Massachusetts ceded its claim to the United States government, and sovereignty and jurisdiction of the region to New York State.

The treaty established Massachusett&#x27;s pre-emptive rights right to negotiate with the Iroquois nations for their aboriginal title to the land ahead of New York, and also gave the two states the exclusive rights ahead of individuals to buy the land. Anyone else who wanted to purchase title to or ownership of land from the Iroquois was required to first obtain Massachusetts&#x27; approval.

After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified the states&#x27; compact. In April 1788, Phelps and Gorham bought the preemptive rights from Massachusetts, but this did not get them the right to develop or re-sell the land. They only obtained exclusive right to negotiate with the Iroquois and obtain clear title to the land. For this preemptive right, they paid Massachusetts $1,000,000 (£300,000) (about $ million in )). This was to be paid in three annual installments.

By an act of the Massachusetts Legislature approved April 1, 1788, it was provided that &quot;this Commonwealth doth hereby agree, to grant, sell &amp; convey to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, for a purchase price of $1,000,000, payable in three equal annual installments all the Right, Title &amp; Demand, which the said Commonwealth has in &amp; to the said &#x27;Western Territory&#x27; ceded to it by the Treaty of Hartford.&quot; But first Phelps and Gorham had to go up against competing companies and persuade the Iroquois to give up their title to the land.

== Council at Buffalo Creek ==
The New York Genesee Land Company, led by John Livingston, was one of the competitors to acquire title to these lands. He gathered several of the chiefs together at Geneva. To circumvent New York state law that only permitted the state to buy land from the natives, he negotiated a lease for a term of 999 years for all the Iroquois lands of Western New York. This included a down payment of $20,000 and an annual payment of $200 to their heirs. But when New York state learned of his agreement, it advised all parties including the natives that the lease had no standing in either Massachusetts or New York.

Another competitor was the Niagara Genesee Land Company formed by Colonel John Butler, Samuel Street, and other Tory friends of the Iroquois. They tried to persuade the Iroquois to grant them a lease. Some proposed that an independent state be created in western New York.

Phelps eliminated many of his competitors by persuading them to join his syndicate. Phelps and Gorham retained 82 shares for themselves, sold 15 shares to the Niagara Genesee Land Company, and divided another 23 shares among 21 persons.

On July 8, 1788, Phelps met with the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, including the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca nations, at Buffalo Creek. His goal was to execute a deed or treaty and obtain title to a portion of their land. The Oneida were split by internal divisions over whether they should give up their title.

=== Missionary influence ===
Phelps was aided by Samuel Kirkland, a Presbyterian minister and missionary among the Oneida. Kirkland had been appointed by the state of Massachusetts to oversee the transaction. Kirkland had previously taken part in six prior illegal land treaties made by individual states with the Indians, in violation of federal authority over Indian affairs. Only the US government had the authority to make treaties with the Native American nations.

Kirkland encouraged the Oneida and other Iroquois to sell their land to the whites in part because he was convinced that they &quot;would never become farmers unless forced to by the loss of land for hunting.&quot; Kirkland also benefitted from the land sales, receiving around present day Utica from New York State and from the Oneida people. Kirkland was determined to build the Hamilton-Oneida Academy and needed financial support from the wealthy land speculators. In November 1790, some Iroquois, including Cornplanter, accused Phelps, Kirkland, and the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant of altering deeds in order to favor Phelps.

=== Land ownership ===
The Indians believed they were owners of the land, but Phelps persuaded the Chiefs that, since they had been allies to the defeated British during the Revolutionary War, and since the British had given up the lands in the 1783 peace treaty, the tribes could expect to retain only the lands granted by the United States. Phelps and Gorham wanted to buy , but the Iroquois refused to sell the rights to 185,000 acre (749 km2) west of the Genesee River.

=== Mill Yard Tract ===
Phelps suggested that the Iroquois could use a grist mill to grind their maize which would relieve the women of the grinding work. The Indians asked how much land was needed for a grist mill, and Phelps suggested a huge section of land west of the Genesee River, much larger than actually required, extending west from the river , running south from Lake Ontario approximately , and totaling about . The section stretches from near the present-day town of Avon north to the community of Charlotte at Lake Ontario and encompasses Rochester. The Iroquois agreed.

Within this area on the west bank, Phelps and Gorham gave at the high falls of the Genesee River to Ebenezer &quot;Indian&quot; Allen, on the condition that he build the grist mill and sawmill. The grist mill was distant from potential customers—only about 25 families lived on the west bank at the time—and there were no roads going to it from the few nearby farms on the west bank of the river. It never prospered. Allen&#x27;s tract became the nucleus of modern Rochester, New York. The section of land on the west bank of the Genesee River became known as the Mill Yard Tract.

=== Purchase agreement ===
Phelps and his company paid the Indians $5,000 cash and promised an annual annuity of $500 to their heirs forever. The agreement gave them title to , included approximately the eastern third of the territory ceded to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford, from the Genesee River in the west to the Preemption Line in the east, which was the boundary that had been set between the lands awarded to Massachusetts and those awarded to New York State by the Treaty of Hartford.

Boundaries established by Phelps&#x27; agreement were reaffirmed between the United States and the Six Nations by Article 3 of the Treaty of Canandaigua in 1794. The scrip&#x27;s low value substantially reduced Massachusetts&#x27; proceeds from the sale.

=== Area boundaries ===

After the Revolutionary War ended, the Iroquois chiefs had been assured by the US government in the 1784 Fort Stanwix treaty that their lands would remain theirs unless the Indians made new cessions—as a result of regular councils duly convened and conducted according to tribal custom. The eastern boundary was defined by a Preemption Line, which was anchored on the south at the 82nd milestone on the New York-Pennsylvania boundary line and on the north by Lake Ontario. The treaties gave Massachusetts the right to buy from the Native Americans and resell all territory west of the Preemption Line, while New York State retained the right to govern that territory. New York State would add to its territory all land east of the Preemption Line.

The Fort Stanwix Treaty and earlier treaties established the approximate western boundary, but a survey was required to establish the exact line. Phelps believed that the line ran through Seneca Lake and included the former Cayuga settlement of Kandesaga, present-day Geneva, New York. He planned to make Geneva the headquarters and location of the land sales office. He hired Col. Hugh Maxwell, a man of high reputation, to perform the survey. During his original survey for Phelps and Gorham, Maxwell was assisted by Augustus Porter and other surveyors.

Maxwell and his assistants started a preliminary survey on June 13, 1788, from the 82-mile stone on the Pennsylvania Line. The trial survey reached Seneca Lake. The actual survey was started on July 25, 1788, and when the surveyors reached the area of Kandesaga, the line was fixed west of Seneca Lake and Kandesaga, which survived as a key town in the region. Oliver Phelps was extremely upset when he learned that the survey did not include Seneca Lake or the Indian village. He wrote a letter to Col. William Walker, the local agent responsible for the survey, and requested that they survey be redone in that area. For unknown reasons, it was not completed.

On the west, the survey ran north from the Pennsylvania border to the confluence of Canaseraga Creek and the Genesee River. The survey line followed the river to a point north of Canawagus Village, and then due west distant from the westernmost bend, and then due north to the shore of Lake Ontario. Maxwell divided the land into ranges wide from north to south. Maxwell&#x27;s work later became known as &quot;The First Survey.&quot;

=== Settlers arrive ===
Phelps opened one of the first land sales offices in the U.S. in Suffield, Connecticut and another in Canandaigua. During the next two years, they sold at a higher price to a number of buyers. People arrived from New England, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and from across the Atlantic, from England and Scotland. Settlers also included veterans who had fought under General Sullivan. There was considerable land hunger among people in New England, who had been crowded for some time.

== Financial difficulties ==
Many purchasers were buying land for speculative purposes and quickly resold it. For example, Oliver Phelps sold township 3, range 2, to Prince Bryant of Pennsylvania on September 5, 1789. Prince Bryant sold the land a month later to Elijah Babcock, who in turn sold various parcels to Roger Clark, Samuel Tooker, David Holmes, and William Babcock. The syndicate was able to sell about half of its holdings.

=== Syndicate defaults ===

However, within the year, currency values rose in anticipation of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s plan to nationalize the debts of the states forming the new nation. This raised the value of the consolidated securities Phelps and Gorham had used to buy the land, effectively quadrupling the syndicate&#x27;s debt and substantially inflating the amount required to purchase title from the Iroquois for the remaining . The syndicate sold about 50 townships but the purchasers were mainly stockholders who had accepted land in exchange for interest on the loan principal. Fewer emigrants bought land than expected, reducing the income expected by the syndicate. Two of the three bonds financing the purchase were canceled, but even when the debt was reduced to $109,333 (£31,000) (about $ million in ), the syndicate was unable to make the next payment. In August 1790, the reverses forced Phelps to sell his Suffield home and his interest in the Hartford National Bank and Trust Co. of Connecticut

In early 1791, the syndicate was unable to make the second payment on the preemptive right to the lands west of the Genesee River, comprising some , and these preemptive rights reverted to Massachusetts on March 10, 1791. On March 12, Massachusetts agreed to sell these rights to Robert Morris for $333,333.33 (about $ million in ). Morris was a signatory of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, and was the major financier of the American Revolution. At the time, he was the richest man in America. Morris paid about 11 or 12 cents an acre for the land, or about $9,878 (£24,695) (about $ thousand in ). The land was conveyed to Morris in five deeds on May 11, 1791. On August 10, 1790, the syndicate sold the remaining lands of the Genesee tract directly to Morris, with the exception of about 47,000 acres retained by Phelps and Gorham. The deed was conveyed on November 18, 1790, and specified that the tract should contain 1 million acres, and any amount over that would require further payment.

On September 21, 1791, Geneva was described as &quot;a small, unhealthy village with about 15 houses, all of log construction except three. There are about 20 families.&quot;

=== Survey inaccuracies ===
When Morris bought the property, issues with the first survey were well known. The purchase deed stated, &quot;A manifest error has been committed in the laying out and dividing the same, so that a new survey must be laid in order to correct the said error.&quot; Some accounts from early in the 20th century attribute errors discovered during the second survey to the primitive instruments used by the surveyors, but allegations of fraud were also made. A description of the survey in 1892 cast suspicion on an assistant surveyor named Jenkins, who was supposed to have altered the survey line to favor his employer, Peter Ryckman. He wanted to control the site of present-day Geneva. Ryckman had previously sought to buy the land directly from the Iroquois, but it was illegal under New York state law for him to buy land from the natives, and his contract was voided by the state. When a new survey was commissioned, Maxwell&#x27;s survey became known as &quot;The First Survey.&quot;

Adam Hoops was hired to lead a team of new surveyors, who discovered that Maxwell erred on both the eastern preemption line and the western boundary. Maxwell had located the westernmost boundary of the Millyard Tract in the belief that the Genesee River ran due north. Hoops&#x27; team found that Maxwell had made a serious error when he ignored the variance between magnetic north and true north. A survey team that Benjamin Ellicott headed found in November–December 1792 that the preemption line ran through Seneca Lake and north along a line to Lake Ontario near the center of Sodus Bay, about four miles west of the line surveyed by Maxwell. The line now divides the city of Geneva and the Town of Waterloo in Border City. The old preemption line reached Lake Ontario, three miles west of Sodus Bay. The new line terminated near the center of the head of the bay. The new preemption line traveled in a northeasterly direction from the west end of the southern boundary.

In his new survey, Hoops established that the western boundary of the Mill Yard tract included a gore-shaped tract of land about west of the Genesee River, that should have been retained by the Iroquois. To make it easier, Morris&#x27; syndicate returned an equivalent amount of land on the west, a parcel known as the Triangle Tract, to the Iroquois. Morris then purchased the rights to the Triangle Tract from the Iroquois; this land became part of the Morris Reserve. The area of land purchased by Morris was fixed at . Hoop&#x27;s corrected survey became known as the &quot;Second Survey&quot; and was accepted by Simeon DeWitt, New York&#x27;s surveyor-general, in a resolution passed by the state on March 24, 1795.

=== London investors purchase land ===
After buying the land from the state of Massachusetts in early 1790, Morris almost immediately resold through his London agent William Temple Franklin to the Pulteney Associates, led by Sir William Pulteney. He sold at more than double the price he had paid. Sir William Pulteney bought 9/12ths interest, William Hornby 2/12ths, and Patrick Colquhoun 1/12th interest. At the time non-citizens could not legally hold title to land. The buyers sent Charles Williamson from Scotland, and he was naturalized on January 9, 1792, in order to permit him to hold the land in trust for the owners. He relocated to the United States in February 1792 and settled on the tract. Morris conveyed the deed to Williamson on April 11, 1792, and was paid $333,333 (£75,000). The U.S. Congress had passed The Coinage Act which established the U.S. Mint and the dollar as its official currency only a week before. Morris made a profit of over $160,000 on the transaction.

The Pulteney Purchase, or the Genesee Tract, as it was also known, comprised all of the present counties of Ontario, Steuben and Yates, as well as portions of Allegany, Livingston, Monroe, Schuyler and Wayne counties. After Sir William Pulteney&#x27;s death in 1805, it was known as the Pulteney Estate.

=== Holland Land Purchase ===
Morris sold additional land in December 1792 and in February and July 1793 to the Holland Land Company, an unincorporated syndicate formed by Willem Willink and thirteen other Dutch bankers. The bankers hired American trustees in the United States to take title to the land, because New York state law made it illegal for them to own the property directly. Robert Morris prevailed upon the New York Legislature to repeal that ordinance, which it did shortly thereafter, as it was eager to have the lands developed into settlements.

The investors of the Holland Land Company could in a worst-case scenario resell their property, i.e. the right to purchase aboriginal land. The investors expected a significant profit if they could obtain clear title from the Iroquois and sell unencumbered parcels of land. They organized a council at Big Tree in the summer of 1797. The council was attended by the Iroquois sachems, Robert Morris, James Wadsworth (who represented the federal government), and Joseph Ellicott, who represented the Holland Land Company. The Europeans and Americans found Red Jacket, chief of the Seneca, very difficult to negotiate with. The Dutch gave presents to the influential women of the tribes, and offered generous payments to several other chiefs to influence their cooperation. They offered the Iroquois about 200,000 acres in return as reservations for the tribes. The result was the Treaty of Big Tree.

In 1802, the Holland Land Company opened its sales office in Batavia, managed by surveyor and agent Joseph Ellicott. The office remained open until 1846 when the company was finally dissolved. The Company granted some plots of land to persons with the condition that they establish improvements, such as inns and taverns, to encourage growth. The building that housed the Holland Land Office still exists; it is operated as a museum dedicated to the Holland Purchase and is designated a National Historic Landmark.

== Morris Reserve ==
Morris kept in a strip along the east side of the lands acquired from Massachusetts, from the Pennsylvania border to Lake Ontario. This later became known as the Morris Reserve. At the north end of the Morris Reserve, Morris sold a triangular-shaped tract to Herman Leroy, William Bayard, and John McEvers. This was nicknamed the Triangle Tract. A tract due west of the Triangle Tract was sold to the State of Connecticut.

In May 1796, John Barker Church accepted a mortgage on another 100,000 acres of the Morris Reserve in present-day Allegany County and Genesee County, against a debt owed to him by Morris. After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, Church foreclosed, and Church&#x27;s son Philip Schuyler Church acquired the land in May 1800. Philip began the settlement of Allegany and Genesee counties by founding the village of Angelica, New York.

As noted above, in September 1797 under the Treaty of Big Tree, negotiated and signed at Geneseo, New York, Morris gained the remaining title to all the lands west of the Genesee held by the Iroquois. Morris paid $100,000 (equivalent to about $ million in ) along with perpetual annuities, among other concessions. He created ten reservations for the Iroquois nations within the purchase; these totalled 200,000 acres (800 km2), in comparison to the millions of acres they had ceded. The remainder of the Morris Reserve was quickly subdivided and settled.

== Subdivision into counties of New York ==

In 1802, the entire Holland Purchase, as well as the 500,000 acre (2,000 km2) Morris Reserve immediately to the east, was split off from Ontario County and organized as Genesee County.

In the ensuing 40 years after Genesee County was formed, it was repeatedly split to form all or parts of the counties of Allegany (1806), Niagara (1808), Cattaraugus (1808), Chautauqua (1808), Erie (1821), Monroe (1821), Livingston (1821), Orleans (1824), and Wyoming (1841).

== Legacy ==
Many of the men who were active in these land sales were honored, either by their business associates or by settlers, in the place names of new villages. Many of the original villages have retained their identity as the central district of a larger town:

* Busti, a town in Chautauqua County, named for agent Paolo Busti
* Cazenovia, a town and its village in Madison County, named for agent Theophilus Cazenove
* Ellicott, a town in Chautauqua County, named for surveyor Joseph Ellicott
* Ellicottville, a town and its village in Cattaraugus County, also named for Joseph Ellicott
* Franklinville, a town and its village in Cattaraugus County, named for agent William Temple Franklin, a grandson of Benjamin Franklin
* Gorham, a town in Ontario County, named for Nathaniel Gorham
* Holland, a town in Erie County, named for the Holland Purchase or the Holland Land Company
* Leroy, New York, a town in Genesee County, named for Herman Le Roy, one of the purchasers of the Triangle Tract.
* Mount Morris, a town and its village in Livingston County, named for Robert Morris
* Phelps, a town and its village in Ontario County, named for Oliver Phelps
* Williamson, a town in Wayne County, named for Charles Williamson

In contrast, Angelica, a town and its village in Allegany County, were named by landowner Philip Church for his mother, Angelica Schuyler Church.

<text>In geology, a chott, shott, or shatt (; ) is a salt lake in Africa&#x27;s Maghreb that stays dry for much of the year but receives some water in the winter. The elevation of a chott surface is controlled by the position of the water table and capillary fringe, with sediment deflation occurring when the water table falls and sediment accumulation occurring when the water table rises. They are formed—within variable shores—by the spring thaw from the Atlas mountain range, along with occasional rainwater or groundwater sources in the Sahara, such as the Bas Saharan Basin.

==Water sources==

The chotts of the Sahara are fed intermittently during periods of infrequent rainfall. They are subject to a high evaporation rate, hence salts eventually accumulate in the surface of the sediment. In fact, annual evaporation rates per year in chotts often exceed 20 times the annual precipitation rate. This salt accumulation can lead chotts to have particularly high albedo, albeit with comparable variability as well. While evaporite deposition predominates on chotts, in more humid climatic periods, layers of mud can be deposited on the chott surface. When near a source of loose sand, aeolian deposition can also play a role in the sedimentary deposition on the chott surface.

==Sahara Sea==

As many lie below sea level, the chotts of the Sahara were viewed by some European colonialists and engineers as an opportunity to create an inland sea in the Sahara Desert (known by many as the &quot;Sahara Sea&quot;) by cutting a canal to the Mediterranean Sea (or in some cases, the Atlantic Ocean). Such a channel would allow water from the sea to flow inland. The hope was that this would facilitate trade and naval warfare, as well as change the climatic conditions of the Sahara.

==Analogue to Martian landforms==
Chotts have also been studied because they are believed to be an Earth analogue to similar features on the planet Mars. Although there are considerable differences between terrestrial and Martian geology, some features on Mars are also believed to be evaporite basins, and consequently share at least some features of chotts. One example of a suspected Martian evaporite basin is Holden Crater.

<text>This is a list of active United States Navy aircraft squadrons. &quot;Deactivated&quot; or &quot;disestablished&quot; squadrons are listed in the list of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons.

Navy aircraft squadrons are composed of several aircraft (from as few as about four to as many as about a dozen), the officers who fly them, the officers and sailors who maintain them and administrative support officers and sailors. Some of the units listed in this article are not designated as &quot;squadrons&quot;, but they all operate U.S. Navy aircraft in some capacity.

Squadrons and their history are listed in the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons&quot; (DANAS).

==Squadron organization==

Most active duty squadrons are commanded by a commanding officer (CO) who holds the rank of commander. Second in command is the executive officer (XO), who also holds the rank of commander. The XO typically assumes command of the squadron after approximately 15 months. There are typically four functional departments – Operations, Maintenance, Safety/NATOPS, and Administration – each led by a lieutenant commander functioning as the department head. Within the departments are divisions (each typically headed by a lieutenant) and branches (headed by a lieutenant, junior grade or a chief petty officer).

The CO of a Reserve squadron is also a commander, as is the XO who will also assume command after approximately 15 months. However, reserve squadron demographics are typically older and more senior in rank than their active duty squadron counterparts. Department heads in reserve squadrons are typically senior lieutenant commanders, although some may be recently promoted commanders. Where this difference in maturity level becomes more apparent is at the division officer level. Since most officers in reserve squadrons previously served on active duty in the Regular Navy in a flying status for eight to ten or more years, they are typically already lieutenant commanders, or achieve that rank shortly after transferring to the Navy Reserve. As a result, lieutenants are a minority and lieutenants, junior grade, are practically non-existent in reserve squadrons. As a result, divisions are typically headed by lieutenant commanders and branches by lieutenants, senior chief petty officers or chief petty officers.

==Types of squadrons==
Squadrons are categorised in various ways: active versus US Navy Reserve, land-based or sea-based, by aircraft type -fixed wing, rotary wing (helicopter. tiltrotor), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and by mission. Unlike the USAF, US Army, and USMC, the US Navy does not refer to units that carry out as maintenance, medical, administrative or other units as &quot;squadrons&quot;; for the USN a squadron is a unit of aircraft, ships, submarines or boats. There are two exceptions: Tactical Air Control Squadrons (TACRON) consists of personnel specialized in the control of aircraft in support of amphibious operations; and the operating units of Naval Special Warfare Development Group colloquially known as &quot;SEAL Team Six&quot;, are called &quot;squadrons&quot; named by color (these squadrons are the organizational equivalent of a &quot;regular&quot; SEAL Team). .

US Navy Reserve squadrons are manned by a combination of full-time and part-time reservists. In general, reserve squadrons share the same missions as their active counterparts, although there are Reserve missions (e.g., Adversary and Fleet Logistics Support) that have no Active counterpart.

At any one time, the US Navy has approximately 600 aircraft that are associated with particular ships. There are also several thousand additional Navy aircraft that are capable of shipboard operations, but are not associated with a ship and several hundred land-based aircraft that are not capable of shipboard operations.

==Squadron designations==
Navy aircraft squadrons can be properly referred to by designation or nickname. A squadron&#x27;s designation describes its mission and therefore generally the type of aircraft it flies.
* The Formal form designation (e.g., Strike Fighter Squadron Eight Six) indicates the mission.
** A subset of the formal form designation is a Navy acronym format in capital letters, e.g., STKFITRON EIGHT SIX
* The abbreviated designation (e.g., VFA-86) also indicates the type and mission, as each of the letters has a meaning. In this case, &quot;V&quot; stands for fixed wing, &quot;F&quot; stands for fighter, and &quot;A&quot; stands for attack.
* Nickname – e.g., &quot;Sidewinders&quot;.

Note: The presence of an &quot;M&quot; after the &quot;V&quot; (or &quot;H&quot; in the case of a helicopter squadron) denotes a USMC squadron: i.e. VMFA, VMR, HMLA.

A single squadron can carry a number of designations through its existence. Chief Of Naval Operations Instruction 5030.4G governs the squadron designation system. A squadron comes into existence when it is &quot;established&quot;. Upon establishment it receives a designation, for example Patrol Squadron One (&quot;VP-1&quot;). During the life of the squadron it may be &quot;redesignated&quot; one or more times, the Navy&#x27;s oldest currently active squadron is VFA-14 and it has been redesignated 15 times since it was established in 1919. Over the history of U. S. Naval Aviation there have been many designations which have been used multiple times (re-used) resulting in multiple unrelated squadrons bearing the same designation at different times. See also List of Inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons.

==Fixed wing squadrons==
Navy fixed wing squadron designations start with the letter &quot;V&quot;. In 1920 with issuance of General Order 541, two overall types of aircraft were identified and assigned permanent letters; lighter than air types were identified by the letter Z and heavier than air types by the letter V. The use of letter abbreviations for squadrons was promulgated in the &quot;Naval Aeronautic Organization for Fiscal Year 1923&quot; which is the first known record associating the abbreviated Aircraft Class Designations with abbreviated squadron designations. In 1948 the Navy established its first two operational helicopter squadrons designating them as Helicopter Utility Squadrons and gave them the designation &quot;HU&quot; (&#x27;Helicopter, Utility&#x27;). From that point on squadrons which flew rotary wing aircraft were designated with the first letter of &quot;H&quot; . There were two exceptions the use of &quot;RVAH&quot; to denote Reconnaissance Attack Squadrons which operated the RA-5C Vigilante during the 1960s and 1970s and the use of &quot;RVAW&quot; from 1967 to 1983 to designate the Airborne Early Warning (VAW) Fleet Replacement Squadrons.

===Electronic Attack (VAQ)===

The VAQ (V-fixed wing, A-attack, Q-electronic). designation was established in 1968 to designate &quot;Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron&quot;. On 30 March 1998 the name of the designation was changed to &quot;Electronic Attack Squadron&quot; and all VAQ squadrons then in existence were renamed from &quot;Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron&quot; to &quot;Electronic Attack Squadron&quot;.

Electronic Attack Squadrons consists of seven Boeing EA-18G Growlers (with the exception of the Fleet Replacement Squadron which has more). The primary mission of the Growler is Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) in support of strike aircraft and ground troops by interrupting enemy electronic activity and obtaining tactical electronic intelligence within the combat area.

Most VAQ squadrons are carrier based, however a number are &quot;expeditionary&quot;, deploying to overseas land bases. When not deployed most are &#x27;home-ported&#x27; at NAS Whidbey Island, WA except VAQ-141, which is forward deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

Note: The parenthetical (Second use) and (2nd) appended to some designations in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation to designate a squadron and that these were the second use of that designation.

===Airborne Command &amp; Control (VAW)===
The VAW designation was first created in July 1948 with the establishment of VAW-1 and VAW-2 to designate &quot;Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron&quot;. It was in use for only one month as in August 1948 VAW-1 and VAW-2 were redesignated &quot;Composite Squadron&quot; VC-11 and VC-12. In 1948 the VAW designation was resurrected when VC-11 and VC-12 were redesignated VAW-11 and VAW-12. In 1967, VAW-11 and VAW-12 which were large land based squadrons that provided detachments of Airborne Early Warning aircraft to deploying Carrier Air Wings were redesignated as wings and each of their detachments were established as separate squadrons. Established from VAW-11 were RVAW-110 (a FRS), VAW-111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116 and established from VAW-12 were RVAW-120 (a FRS), VAW-121, 122, 123. In 2019, the VAW designation was renamed from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron to Airborne Command and Control squadron and all VAW squadrons were renamed &quot;Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron XXX&quot; while retaining the VAW designation.

Each Carrier Airborne Command and Control squadron consists of four E-2C or five E-2D Hawkeyes except for the Fleet Replacement Squadron which has more. Transition to the E-2D Hawkeye is in progress and should be complete by 2025. The Hawkeye&#x27;s primary mission is to provide all-weather airborne early warning, airborne battle management and command and control (C2) functions for the carrier strike group and Joint Force Commander. Additional missions include surface surveillance coordination, air interdiction, offensive and defensive counter air control, close air support coordination, time critical strike coordination, search and rescue airborne coordination and communications relay. The E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound are built on the same airframe and have many similar characteristics. For this reason, both aircraft are trained for in the same Fleet Replacement Squadron.

When not deployed, they are home-ported at either Naval Station Norfolk, VA or Naval Air Station Point Mugu, CA. The exception is VAW-125, which is forward deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.

===Strike Fighter (VFA)===
The VFA designation was created in 1980 to designate &quot;Fighter Attack Squadron&quot;. The designation was assigned to squadrons equipped with the new F/A-18A Hornet fighter attack aircraft. In 1983 the designation was changed to &quot;Strike Fighter Squadron&quot; and all VFA squadrons in existence at the time were renamed from &quot;Fighter Attack Squadron-___&quot; to &quot;Strike Fighter Squadron-___&quot;. The Marine Corps did not participate in this renaming and VMFA squadrons retain the title &quot;Fighter Attack Squadron&quot;. A Strike Fighter Squadron consists of either ten or twelve F/A-18E single seat Super Hornets, twelve F/A-18F two seat Super Hornets or ten F-35C Lightning IIs. Training squadrons (known as Fleet Replacement Squadrons) have many more aircraft. The Hornet and Super Hornet are all-weather aircraft used for attack and fighter missions. In fighter mode, they are used as a fighter escort and for fleet air defense; in attack mode, they are used for force projection, interdiction and close and deep air support. The Hornet and Super Hornet are also used for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and the Super Hornet for aerial refueling.

The F-35C is a fifth-generation strike fighter that was originally planned to replace the F/A-18C Hornet, but expiring F/A-18C service life and delays in F-35C procurement forced the Navy to increase its buy of F/A-18E and F Super Hornets to replace F/A-18C Hornets while awaiting the arrival of the F-35C. The last active component F/A-18C Hornet squadron began its transition to the Super Hornet in February 2019, leaving only a single reserve component F/A-18C Hornet squadron which in 2022 was redesignated a Fighter Composite Squadron and replaced its F/A-18C Hornets with F-5N and F &quot;adversary&quot; aircraft. The first deployable squadron to transition to the F-35C was a Super Hornet squadron. Ultimately each Carrier Air Wing will be equipped with two Super Hornet squadrons and two F-35C squadrons.

VFA squadrons are home-ported at NAS Lemoore, CA or NAS Oceana, VA when not deployed, except for the squadrons of CVW-5 (which are forward deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan).

Note: The parenthetical (1st), (2nd), (3rd) etc... appended to some designations in the lineage column of table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.


===Fighter Squadron Composite (VFC)===

The VFC designation was created in 1988 when two Fleet Composite (VC) squadrons (VC-12 &amp; 13) which were dedicated adversary squadrons were redesignated to differentiate them from the remaining VC squadrons which fulfilled various miscellaneous or utility roles. In 2006 a third VFC squadron (VFC-111) was established from what had become a permanent detachment of VFC-13 and in 2022 a fourth VFC squadron was created when the last remaining USNR VFA squadron (VFA-204) was redesignated to VFC. VFC squadrons provide adversary simulation for fleet squadrons. All VFC squadrons are Navy Reserve squadrons.

Two of the squadrons are based at NAS Fallon and NAS Key West to support fleet VFA squadron training at the extensive range complexes supported by those air stations. A third is based at NAS Oceana to support Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic squadron training and the fourth is based at NAS JRB New Orleans.

Note: The parenthetical (2nd) and (3rd) appended to some designations in the lineage column of table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.


===Patrol and Reconnaissance (VP), Special Projects (VPU), Unmanned Patrol (VUP)===

The VP designation is one of the oldest in the U. S. Navy and is the oldest designation currently in use. It first appeared in 1922 to designate &quot;Seaplane Patrol Squadron&quot; and from 1924 it has designated &quot;Patrol Squadron&quot;. In 1982 the VPU Patrol Squadron Special Unit designation was created. Maritime patrol aircraft are used primarily for reconnaissance, anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. Volume 2 of the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons contains comprehensive histories over 150 patrol squadrons. Its Appendix 7 details the lineage of every VP, VPB, VP(H), and VP(AM) squadron from 1922 through the late 1990s.

In 2016 the first &quot;unmanned&quot; Patrol Squadron (VUP) was established. VUP-19 operates the MQ-4C Triton unmanned air vehicle from an operations center located at NAS Jacksonville while its aircraft with aircraft maintenance personnel are deployed around the world as required. A second VUP squadron is programmed for establishment in the future with an operations center at NAS Whidbey Island.

When not deployed VP squadrons are home-ported at NAS Jacksonville, FL or NAS Whidbey Island, WA.

Note: The parenthetical (1st), (2nd), (3rd) and (First use), (Second use) etc... appended to some designations in the table below are not part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.


===Fleet Air Reconnaissance (VQ)===
The VQ designation was created in 1955 to designate &quot;Electronic Countermeasures Squadron&quot; and did so though 1959. By 1960 the VQ squadrons, rather than simply jamming communications and electronic signals, had been equipped to collect them for intelligence purposes. In January 1960 this new role of the VQ squadrons was recognized by changing the VQ designation from &quot;Electronic Countermeasures Squadron&quot; to &quot;Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron.&quot; Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE is currently the Navy&#x27;s only overt signals intelligence (SIGINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) reconnaissance squadron. The 13 EP-3E aircraft in the Navy&#x27;s inventory are based on the Orion P-3 airframe and provided fleet and theater commanders worldwide with near real-time tactical SIGINT and COMINT. With sensitive receivers and high-gain dish antennas, the EP-3E exploits a wide range of electronic emissions from deep within targeted territory. Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE retired their final EP-3E in February of 2025, with the squadron to be disestablished in March of 2025. The EP-3E and Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron mission is planned to be replaced by a combination of MQ-4C Triton drones from Unmanned Patrol Squadrons. 

Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadrons THREE and FOUR carry the VQ designation, but they are not reconnaissance squadrons; they are airborne command and control, and communications relay squadrons which provide survivable, reliable, and endurable airborne command, control, and communications between the National Command Authority (NCA) and U.S. strategic and non-strategic forces. The squadrons&#x27; E-6B aircraft are dual-mission aircraft, capable of fulfilling both the airborne strategic command post mission equipped with an airborne launch control system (ALCS) which is capable of launching U.S. land based intercontinental ballistic missiles and fulfilling the TACAMO (&quot;Take Charge and Move Out&quot;) mission which links the NCA with Navy ballistic missile submarine forces during times of crisis. The aircraft carries a very low frequency communication system with dual trailing wire antennae for that communications relay mission.

Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron SEVEN is the E-6B Fleet Replacement Squadron, providing initial and requalification training for pilots, aircrewmen, and maintainers. It operates E-6Bs on loan from VQ-3 and VQ-4, having returned a 737-600 it had previously operated on lease from Lauda Air.

===Fleet Logistics Support (VR)===
The VR designator was first established in 1942 to designated &quot;Transport&quot; or &quot;Air Transport&quot; or &quot;Fleet Logistic Air&quot; squadrons. From 1958 to 1976, it designated &quot;Fleet Tactical Support Squadron&quot;; from 1976 to the present, it designates &quot;Fleet Logistics Support Squadron&quot;. Today, all Fleet Logistics Support squadrons are U.S. Navy Reserve squadrons

Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons operate Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift (NUFEA) aircraft on a worldwide basis to provide responsive, flexible, and rapidly deployable air logistics support required to sustain combat operations from the sea. During peacetime, squadrons provide air logistics support for all Navy commands as well as provide continuous quality training for mobilization readiness. Fleet Logistics Support squadrons have no counterpart in the Regular Navy. They represent 100% of the Navy&#x27;s medium and heavy intra-theater airlift, and operate year-round around the world, providing the critical link between deployed seagoing units and air mobility command logistics hubs. VR-1 provides dedicated airlift support to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps.

The Headquarters of the Fleet Logistics Support Wing is based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, but the squadrons of the wing are based across the country from the east coast to Hawaii. In addition to the VR squadrons, the Fleet Logistics Support Wing also operates two &quot;Executive Transport Detachments&quot; based in Hawaii and Sigonella, Italy.

Note: The parenthetical (2nd), (3rd), or (second use), (third use), etc., appended to some designations in the table below are not part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.

===Fleet Logistics Support (VRC)===

The VRC designation was established in 1960 to designate &quot;Fleet Tactical Support Squadron&quot;. In 1976 the designation was changed to &quot;Fleet Logistics Support Squadron.&quot;

There are two Fleet Logistic Support squadrons equipped with the C-2A Greyhound Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft – one on each coast. VRC-30 is based at Naval Air Station North Island, VRC-40 is based at Naval Station Norfolk. These squadrons send two-plane detachments with each deploying Carrier Air Wing. The C-2A Greyhound, more commonly referred to as a &quot;COD&quot; (short for Carrier onboard delivery), is used to deliver high priority parts, supplies, people, and mail to/from the carrier and shore sites near the carrier operating area.

The E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound are built on the same airframe and have many similar characteristics. For this reason, both aircraft are trained for in the same Fleet Replacement Squadron, VAW-120 (see VAW section).

=== Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission (VRM) ===
&quot;The Bell Boeing CMV-22B Osprey long-range tiltrotor aircraft is the US Navy’s future variant of MV-22B Osprey assault support aircraft developed for the US Marine Corps. The medium-lift variant will operate as a carrier on-board delivery (COD) aircraft to meet the logistics support requirements of the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC) during time-critical scenarios. It will replace Northrop Grumman-built C-2A Greyhound cargo aircraft that has been in service with the US Navy since the 1960s. The CMV-22B will be used by the US Navy for transportation of special warfare teams, mail and cargo from shore to its aircraft carriers, as well as for shore or sea-based combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) missions&quot;.

The development of the VRM designation and adoption of the CMV-22B demonstrates the Navy&#x27;s intent to utilize the platform as a means of replacing the carrier-based C-2A Greyhound. This shift in direction has coincided with the formation of the Navy&#x27;s first VRM squadron, the &quot;Titans&quot; of VRM-30 (The name of which was revived from the &quot;Titans&quot; of HSL-94).

===Training (VT)===
The VT designation was one of the original designations. It was established in 1921 to designate &quot;Torpedo Plane Squadron&quot;. From 1922 to 1930 it designated &quot;Torpedo &amp; Bombing Squadron&quot; and from 1930 to 1946 &quot;Torpedo Squadron&quot;. In 1946 all remaining Torpedo Squadrons and Bombing Squadrons (VB) were redesignated &quot;Attack Squadrons&quot; (VA) and the VT designation was retired.

From 1927 to 1947 training squadrons were designated &quot;VN&quot;. From 1947 to 1960 training units were not designated as squadrons, they were &quot;units&quot; or &quot;groups&quot; called Basic Training Groups (BTG), Advanced Training Units (ATU), Jet Transition Training Units (JTTU) or Multi Engine Training Groups (METG). On 1 May 1960 the VT designation was resurrected and existing flying training units were designated &quot;Training Squadrons (VT)&quot;.

There are two types of fixed wing training squadrons: Primary training squadrons train students in the first stage of flight training leading to selection to one of three advanced training pipelines for Aviators (Rotary Wing, Strike or Multi-Engine) or two advanced training pipelines for Flight Officers (Multi Crew or Strike). The advanced training squadrons conduct the final stage of flight training leading to &quot;winging&quot; of the new Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Training squadrons are organized differently than the Navy&#x27;s operational squadrons as training squadrons do not own their own aircraft. All training aircraft are assigned to and maintained by the Training Air Wing to which the squadrons are assigned. The training squadrons are composed only of Instructors and Students, with all maintenance and support functions carried out by the Training Air Wing. Training aircraft are painted orange and white.

===Air Test and Evaluation (VX), Scientific Development (VXS)===

The VX designation was first used from 1927 to 1943 to designate &quot;Experimental Squadron&quot;. It was again used beginning in 1946 when four &quot;Experimental and Development&quot; squadrons (VX-1 (still exists today), 2, 3 and 4) were established to develop and evaluate new equipment and methods. From 1946 to 1968 the designation was variously &quot;Experimental and Development&quot; squadron, &quot;Operational Development&quot; squadron, &quot;Air Operational Development&quot; squadron and &quot;Air Development&quot; squadron. In 1969 the designation changed to &quot;Air Test and Evaluation&quot; and it remains as such today.

Test and Evaluation squadrons test everything from basic aircraft flying qualities to advanced aerodynamics to weapons systems effectiveness. VX-20, VX-23, VX-30, VX-31 (as well as HX-21 (rotary wing squadron) and UX-24 (UAS squadron)) are developmental test and evaluation squadrons which conduct or support developmental test and evaluation of aircraft and weapons as part of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) while VX-1 and VX-9 are operational test and evaluation squadrons which conduct operational test and evaluation of aircraft and weapons as part of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR).

===Other Fixed Wing Aircraft Units===

Other than the Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron (NFDS) &quot;Blue Angels&quot;, the organizations in the table below are not technically &quot;squadrons&quot;, however they either have custody of and routinely fly Navy aircraft or they routinely fly aircraft on loan from fleet squadrons for advanced training of those fleet squadrons.

The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School operates various fixed and rotary wing aircraft to train and graduate test pilots and test engineers.

The Navy Fighter Weapons School, Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapons School and the Airborne Electronic Attack Weapons School train selected U. S. Navy Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) in instructional techniques and in advanced tactics in their respective aircraft, qualifying them for assignment to their respective wing weapons schools (Strike Fighter Weapons School Lant and Pac, Electronic Attack Weapons School and Airborne Command Control and Logistics School) where they provide advanced training for each wing&#x27;s squadrons utilizing squadron aircraft.


==Rotary wing squadrons==
US Navy rotary wing squadron designations start with the letter H. The first use of the letter H to designate a helicopter squadron was in 1948 with the establishment of Helicopter Utility Squadrons (HU) One and Two. Before then, the two basic types of Navy squadrons were &quot;heavier than air&quot; squadrons designated with V and &quot;lighter than air&quot; squadrons designated with Z. By 1961 the Navy had disestablished its last lighter than air squadrons; since then V has in practicality become the designation for &quot;fixed wing squadron&quot; and H for &quot;rotary wing squadron.&quot; The Navy today uses helicopters for antisubmarine warfare, antisurface warfare, mine countermeasures, combat search and rescue, special operations, overwater search and rescue, and vertical replenishment roles.

===Helicopter Mine Countermeasures (HM)===

The HM designation was created in 1971 to designate &quot;Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron&quot;. HM Squadrons employ 28 total Sikorsky MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters. The primary mission of the Sea Dragon is Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM). The MH-53 can operate from aircraft carriers, large amphibious ships and the new expeditionary sea base and is capable of towing a variety of mine hunting/sweeping countermeasures systems.
The MH-53E Sea Dragon can also carry an impressive amount of cargo, equipment, or number of personnel over long distances. The Sea Dragon is the Navy&#x27;s only heavy-lift helicopter and only proven mine countermeasure platform.

The Navy&#x27;s recently completed &quot;Helicopter Master Plan&quot; was a plan to reduce the number of type/model/series from eight down to two (MH-60R and MH-60S). It recognized that the replacement of the MH-53 in the mine countermeasures role was dependent on technology which has not yet matured. As a result, the MH-53E continues in service as the only helicopter capable now and in the near future of effectively conducting airborne mine countermeasures.

Note: The parenthetical (second use) and (2nd) in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U. S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated.
===Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC)===
The Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) Designation was created in 2005 after the Helicopter Combat Support (HC) squadrons equipped with the H-46 Sea Knight had completed their transitions to the new multi-mission MH-60S Seahawk, and in anticipation of the upcoming transition of the Helicopter Antisubmarine (HS) squadrons from the SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawks to the new MH-60S Knighthawk which began in 2007. The ASW capabilities resident in the HS squadrons were lost in the transition but the new HSC squadrons combine the at sea logistics capability of the former Helicopter Combat Support (HC) squadrons with greatly upgraded Combat Search and Rescue, Naval Special Warfare Support and Anti-Surface Warfare capabilities of the former Helicopter Anti-submarine squadrons (HS).

The HSC squadrons, which were formerly HS squadrons, are carrier based and deploy as part of a Carrier Air Wing, while the HSC squadrons which were formerly HC squadrons or were newly established are land based &quot;expeditionary&quot; squadrons which supply detachments for deployment aboard ships other than aircraft carriers or for land based deployments as required. The squadrons are home-ported at NS Norfolk, NAS North Island and Anderson AFB, Guam with one squadron forward deployed to NAF Atsugi, Japan. Expeditionary HSC squadrons are capable of deploying mixed detachments of MH-60S and MQ-8B Fire Scout uncrewed aircraft.

Note: The parenthetical (2nd) used in the lineage column of table below is not a part of the squadron designation system. It is added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U. S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated.
===Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM)===
The HSM designation was created in 2006 when the Fleet Replacement Squadron for the MH-60R Seahawk was redesignated from HSL. The new designation was created to reflect the MH-60Rs multi-mission capabilities which combined the area search capabilities of the SH-60B flown by the Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL) squadrons with the dipping sonar of the SH-60F flown by the carrier based Helicopter Anti-Submarine (HS) squadrons. The first operational fleet squadron to receive the MH-60 Romeo was HSM-71 in fiscal year 2008. With the transition of the HS squadrons to HSC squadrons without any ASW capability and the disestablishment of the last Air Antisubmarine (VS) squadrons, all ship based airborne ASW capabilities now reside in the new HSM squadrons.

From 2009 to 2015 all Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL) squadrons transitioned to the MH-60R and were redesignated Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) squadrons. Additionally, new HSM squadrons were established in order to provide an HSM squadron to each Carrier Air Wing and to provide &quot;Expeditionary&quot; squadrons to supply detachments of MH-60Rs to ships other than aircraft carriers. Expeditionary HSM squadrons are capable of deploying mixed detachments of MH-60R and MQ-8B aircraft.

HSM squadrons are home-ported at NAS North Island, NAS Jacksonville, NS Mayport and MCAS Kaneohe Bay with two squadrons forward deployed to NAF Atsugi Japan and one squadron forward deployed to Naval Station Rota Spain.
===Helicopter Training (HT)===

The HT designation first appeared in May 1960 to designate Helicopter Training Squadron at the same time that the VT designation was resurrected to designate Training Squadron. In the early years of helicopter operations in the Navy, helicopter pilots were qualified fixed wing pilots who received transition training once they reported to a helicopter squadron. In 1950 a dedicated helicopter training unit was established and in 1960 that unit became the first HT squadron. As the demand for helicopter pilots increased over the decades, additional HT squadrons were established and today approximately 60% of the Student Naval Aviators from all services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) are winged as helicopter pilots.

The Naval Air Training Command&#x27;s Helicopter Training Squadrons provide advanced helicopter flight instruction to all Navy, US Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard helicopter flight students as well as to international students from several allied nations. Student Naval Aviators are selected for helicopter training after completion of primary flight training in the T-6B in one of the VT squadrons. Students who successfully complete the program earn the right to wear the coveted &quot;Wings of Gold.&quot; and proceed on to their selected aircraft&#x27;s Fleet Replacement Squadron. Training squadrons are organized differently than the Navy&#x27;s operational squadrons as training squadrons do not own their own aircraft. All training aircraft are assigned to and maintained by the Training Air Wing to which the squadrons are assigned. The training squadrons are composed only of Instructors and Students, with all maintenance and support functions carried out by the Training Air Wing.


===Air Test and Evaluation (HX)===
Test and Evaluation squadrons test everything from basic aircraft flying qualities to advanced aerodynamics to weapons systems effectiveness. HX-21 conducts developmental test and evaluation of rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft and weapons as part of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM).

===Other Rotary Wing Aircraft Units===
The organizations in the table below are not technically &quot;squadrons&quot;, however they either have custody of and routinely fly Navy aircraft or they routinely fly aircraft on loan from fleet squadrons for advanced training of those fleet squadrons. The Navy Rotary Wing Weapons School trains selected U. S. Navy Naval Aviators in instructional techniques and in advanced tactics for their respective aircraft, qualifying them for assignment to their respective wing weapons schools (Helicopter Sea Combat Weapons School Lant and Pac and Helicopter Maritime Strike Weapons School Lant and Pac) where they provide advanced training for each wing&#x27;s squadrons utilizing squadron aircraft.

==Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Squadrons==
The U.S. Navy operates a number of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) utilizing different organizational constructs. The operational MQ-4 Triton is organized into &quot;Unmanned Patrol Squadrons&quot; (VUP) which operate alongside manned &quot;Patrol Squadrons&quot; (VP) utilizing the same administrative and operational command structures for both VP and VUP squadrons (VUP squadrons are listed in the &quot;Fixed Wing Squadrons&quot; section above). MQ-8 Fire Scouts are operated by HSM and HSC squadrons along with the squadrons&#x27; MH-60R (HSM) and MH-60S (HSC) aircraft. In April 2018 a new squadron type designation was created apart from the existing &quot;V&quot; for fixed wing squadron and &quot;H&quot; for rotary wing squadron when Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Twenty Four (UX-24) was programmed for establishment to develop unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. This action created a third squadron type designation of &quot;U&quot;.

===Air Test and Evaluation (UX)===
Test and Evaluation squadrons test everything from basic aircraft flying qualities to advanced aerodynamics to weapons systems effectiveness. UX-24 conducts developmental test and evaluation of fixed wing and rotary wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as part of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM).

<text>Picea abies, the Norway spruce or European spruce, is a species of spruce native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe.

It has branchlets that typically hang downwards, and the largest cones of any spruce, 9–17 cm long. It is very closely related to the Siberian spruce (&quot;Picea obovata&quot;), which replaces it east of the Ural Mountains, and with which it hybridizes freely. The Norway spruce has a wide distribution for it being planted for its wood, and is the species used as the main Christmas tree in several countries around the world. It was the first gymnosperm to have its genome sequenced. The Latin specific epithet &quot;abies&quot; means &quot;like 
&quot;Abies&quot;, Fir tree&quot;.

== Description ==
Norway spruce is a large, fast-growing evergreen coniferous tree growing tall and with a trunk diameter of 1 to 1.5 m. It can grow fast when young, up to 1 m per year for the first 25 years under good conditions, but becomes slower once over tall. The shoots are orange-brown and glabrous. The leaves are needle-like with blunt tips, 12–14 mm long, quadrangular in cross-section, and dark green on all four sides with inconspicuous stomatal lines. The seed cones are 9–17 cm long (the longest of any spruce), and have bluntly to sharply triangular-pointed scale tips. They are green or reddish, maturing brown 5–7 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 4–5 mm long, with a pale brown 15 mm wing.
The tallest measured Norway spruce is tall and grows near Ribnica na Pohorju, Slovenia.

== Range and ecology ==
The Norway spruce grows throughout Europe from Norway in the northwest and Poland eastward, and also in the mountains of central Europe, southwest to the western end of the Alps, and southeast in the Carpathians and Balkans to the extreme north of Greece. The northern limit is in the arctic, just north of 70° N in Norway. Its eastern limit in Russia is hard to define, due to extensive hybridization and intergradation with the Siberian spruce, but is usually given as the Ural Mountains. However, trees showing some Siberian spruce characters extend as far west as much of northern Finland, with a few records in northeast Norway. The hybrid is known as &quot;Picea&quot; × &quot;fennica&quot; (or &quot;P. abies&quot; subsp. &quot;fennica&quot;, if the two taxa are considered subspecies), and can be distinguished by a tendency towards having hairy shoots and cones with smoothly rounded scales.

Norway spruce cone scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth &quot;Cydia illutana&quot;, whereas &quot;Cydia duplicana&quot; feeds on the bark around injuries or canker.

== Taxonomy ==

Populations in southeast Europe tend to have on average longer cones with more pointed scales; these are sometimes distinguished as &quot;Picea abies&quot; var. &quot;acuminata&quot;, but there is extensive overlap in variation with trees from other parts of the range.

Some botanists treat Siberian spruce as a subspecies of Norway spruce, though in their typical forms, they are very distinct, the Siberian spruce having cones only 5–10 cm long, with smoothly rounded scales, and pubescent shoots. Genetically Norway and Siberian spruces have turned out to be extremely similar and may be considered as two closely related subspecies of &quot;P. abies&quot;.

Another spruce with smoothly rounded cone scales and hairy shoots occurs rarely in the Central Alps in eastern Switzerland. It is also distinct in having thicker, blue-green leaves. Many texts treat this as a variant of Norway spruce, but it is as distinct as many other spruces, and appears to be more closely related to Siberian spruce (&quot;Picea obovata&quot;), Schrenk&#x27;s spruce (&quot;Picea schrenkiana&quot;) from central Asia and Morinda spruce (&quot;Picea smithiana&quot;) in the Himalaya. Treated as a distinct species, it takes the name Alpine spruce (&quot;Picea alpestris&quot;). As with Siberian spruce, it hybridizes extensively with Norway spruce; pure specimens are rare. Hybrids are commonly known as Norwegian spruce, which should not be confused with the pure species Norway spruce.

== Cultivation ==

The Norway spruce is one of the most widely planted spruces, both in and outside of its native range, and one of the most economically important coniferous species in Europe. It is used as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It is also widely planted for use as a Christmas tree. Every Christmas, the Norwegian capital city, Oslo, provides the cities of London (the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree), Edinburgh and Washington, D.C., with a Norway spruce, which is placed at the central most square of each city. This is mainly a sign of gratitude for the aid these countries gave during the Second World War.
In North America, Norway spruce is widely planted, specifically in the Northeastern, Pacific Coast, and Rocky Mountain states, as well as in southeastern Canada. It is naturalised in some parts of North America. There are naturalized populations occurring from Connecticut to Michigan, and it is probable that they occur elsewhere. Norway spruces prefer cool-summer areas and they will grow up to USDA Growing Zone 7.
Seed production begins when the tree is in its fourth decade and total lifespan is up to 300 years in its natural range in Europe. Introduced Norway spruces in the British Isles and North America have a much shorter life expectancy. As the tree ages, its crown thins out and lower branches die off.

In the northern US and Canada, Norway spruce is reported as invasive in some locations; however, it does not pose a problem in Zone 6 and up as the seeds have a significantly reduced germination rate in areas with hot, humid summers.

The Norway spruce tolerates acidic soils well, but does not do well on dry or deficient soils. From 1928 until the 1960s it was planted on surface mine spoils in Indiana.

=== Cultivars ===
Several cultivars have been selected as ornamentals (&#x27;Barrya&#x27;, &#x27;Capitata&#x27;, &#x27;Decumbens&#x27;, &#x27;Dumosa&#x27;, &#x27;Clanbrassiliana&#x27;, &#x27;Gregoryana&#x27;, &#x27;Inversa&#x27;, &#x27;Microsperma&#x27;, &#x27;Nidiformis&#x27;, &#x27;Ohlendorffii&#x27;, &#x27;Repens&#x27;, &#x27;Tabuliformis&#x27;, &#x27;Maxwellii&#x27;, &#x27;Virgata&#x27;, &#x27;Inversa&#x27;, &#x27;Pendula&#x27;), with a wide variety of sizes and shapes, from full-sized forest trees to extremely slow-growing, prostrate forms. They are occasionally traded under the obsolete scientific name &quot;Picea excelsa&quot; (an illegitimate name). The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
*&#x27;Acrocona&#x27; – tall and broad
*&#x27;Clanbrassiliana&#x27; – tall by broad
*&#x27;Inversa&#x27; – tall by broad
*&#x27;Little Gem&#x27; – tall and broad
*&#x27;Nidiformis&#x27; – tall by broad

===Uses===
The Norway spruce is used in forestry for (softwood) timber, and paper production.

The Norwegian company Borregaard produces the synthetic substitute for natural vanilla Vanillin using the Norwegian spruce. They are currently the only company to produce wood based vanillin and is claimed by the company to be preferred by their customers due to, among other reasons, its much lower carbon footprint than petrochemically synthesized vanillin.

It is esteemed as a source of tonewood by stringed-instrument makers, and is commonly used for violins. One form of the tree called (Hazel-spruce) grows in the European Alps and has been recognized by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage. This form was used by Stradivarius for instruments.

====As food====
The tree is the source of spruce beer, which was once used to prevent and even cure scurvy.

Norway spruce shoot tips have been used in traditional Austrian medicine internally (as syrup or tea) and externally (as baths, for inhalation, as ointments, as resin application or as tea) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, skin, locomotor system, gastrointestinal tract and infections.

During the production of Mont d&#x27;Or cheese it is wrapped in a &quot;sangle&quot; made from the cambium of a Norway spruce (French: &quot;&quot;) for about two weeks at least, which gives the cheese a unique flavour.

In Finland, Norway spruce tips (Finnish: &quot;kuusenkerkkä&quot;) are used as a spice, for example, in syrup, herbal tea, alcohol, smoothies, salt, and desserts. Spruce tip syrup is also used as a cold medicine.

== Longevity ==
A press release from Umeå University says that a Norway spruce clone named Old Tjikko, carbon dated as 9,550 years old, is the &quot;oldest living tree&quot;. The oldest individual specimen of Norway spruce discovered by tree ring dating found in 2012 in a nature reserve of Buskerud County, Norway, was found to be 532 years old.

However, Pando, a stand of 47,000 quaking aspen clones, is estimated to be between 14,000 and one million years old.

The stress is on the difference between the singular &quot;oldest tree&quot; and the multiple &quot;oldest trees&quot;, and between &quot;oldest clone&quot; and &quot;oldest non-clone&quot;. Old Tjikko is one of a series of genetically identical clones growing from a root system, one part of which is estimated to be 9,550 years old based on carbon dating. The oldest known individual tree (that has not taken advantage of vegetative cloning) is a Great Basin bristlecone pine over 5,000 years old (germination in 3051 BC).

== Genetics ==
The genome of &quot;Picea abies&quot; was sequenced in 2013, the first gymnosperm genome to be completely sequenced. The genome contains approximately 20 billion base pairs and is about six times the size of the human genome, despite possessing a similar number of genes. A large proportion of the spruce genome consists of repetitive DNA sequences, including long terminal repeat transposable elements. Despite recent advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing, the assembly of such a large and repetitive genome is a particularly challenging task, mainly from a computational perspective.

Within populations of &quot;Picea abies&quot; there is great genetic variability, which most likely reflect populations&#x27; isolation in glacial refugia and post-glacial evolutionary history. Genetic diversity can in particular be detected when looking at how the populations respond to climatic conditions. E.g. variations in timing and length of the annual growth period as well as differences in frost-hardiness in spring and autumn. These annual growth patterns are important to recognize in order to choose the proper reforestation material of &quot;Picea abies&quot;.

== Chemistry ==
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid glucoside, picein, piceatannol and its glucoside (astringin), isorhapontin (the isorhapontigenin glucoside), catechin and ferulic acid are phenolic compounds found in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of Norway spruces. Piceol and astringin are also found in &quot;P. abies&quot;.

== Research ==
Extracts from &quot;Picea abies&quot; have shown inhibitory activity on porcine pancreatic lipase in vitro.

<text>The northern nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), previously known as spotted nutcracker and Eurasian nutcracker, is a passerine bird in the crow family Corvidae. It is slightly larger than the Eurasian jay but has a much larger bill and a slimmer looking head without any crest. The feathering over its body is predominantly chocolate brown with distinct white spots and patches. The wings and upper tail are black with a greenish-blue gloss.

The northern nutcracker is one of four species of nutcracker currently accepted. The southern nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga hemispila&quot;) and the Kashmir nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga multipunctata&quot;) were formerly considered as subspecies of the northern nutcracker. The species complex was known by the English name &quot;spotted nutcracker&quot;. The other member of the genus, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;), occurs in western North America.

==Taxonomy==
The northern nutcracker was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and it still bears its original name &quot;Nucifraga caryocatactes&quot;. The scientific name is a reduplication; &quot;nucifraga&quot; is a Neo-Latin translation of German &quot;Nussbrecher&quot;, &quot;nut-breaker&quot; based on Latin &quot;nucis&quot; &quot;nut&quot;, and &quot;frangere&quot; &quot;to shatter&quot;, and &quot;caryocatactes&quot; based on Greek: &quot;karuon&quot; &quot;nut&quot;, and &quot;kataseio&quot; &quot;to shatter&quot;. The common English name &quot;nutcracker&quot; first appears in 1693 in a translation of a German travel guide, where it is a calque on the German name &quot;Nußknacker&quot;, as the bird was not recorded in Britain until 1753. Other Germanic languages have etymologically related names: Danish: &quot;nøddekrige&quot;; Dutch: &quot;notenkraker&quot;; Norwegian: &quot;nøttekråke&quot;; Swedish: &quot;nötkråka&quot;.

===Subspecies===

Four subspecies are accepted:
* &quot;N. c. caryocatactes&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe
* &quot;N. c. macrorhynchos&quot; C. L. Brehm, 1823 – Ural Mts. to east Siberia and northeast China
* &quot;N. c. rothschildi&quot; E. J. O. Hartert, 1903 – Kazakhstan to northwest China
* &quot;N. c. japonica&quot; E. J. O. Hartert, 1897 – Kuril Islands and north Japan

==Description==
Northern nutcracker ranges from 32–38 cm in length (from tip of beak to tip of tail) and has a wingspan ranging from 49–53 cm. It is a dark brown, broad-winged, short-tailed corvid. Body plumage is mid-to-dark chocolate brown, heavily spotted with white on face, neck, mantle and underparts. It has a large white loral spot, a white eye-ring, blackish-brown cap extending onto the nape, dark blackish wings with a greenish-blue gloss, all white vent, and dark tail with white corners above and a white terminal band on the undertail. In flight, broad wings, white vent and short tail are noticeable; the flight undulating. The black bill is slender to stout and rather long, sharply pointed, and varies in size amongst races. The iris, legs and feet are black.
The voice is loud and harsh, somewhat similar to that of the Eurasian jay but slightly lower pitched and more on a single tone. It is described as &quot;kraak-kraak-kraak-kraak&quot;.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===

The most important food resources for this species are the seeds (pine nuts) of various pines (&quot;Pinus&quot; sp.), principally the cold-climate (far northern and high altitude) species of white pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;) with large seeds: Swiss pine (&quot;P. cembra&quot;), Korean pine (&quot;P. koraiensis&quot;), Japanese white pine (&quot;P. parviflora&quot;, Macedonian pine (&quot;P. peuce&quot;), Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;P. pumila&quot;), and Siberian pine (&quot;P. sibirica&quot;). In some regions, where none of these pines occur, the seeds of spruce (&quot;Picea&quot; sp.) and hazel nuts (&quot;Corylus&quot; sp.) form an important part of the diet too. The forms that take hazel nuts have thicker bills for cracking their hard shells, with a special ridge on the inside of the bill edge near the base. If the shell is too hard, it holds the nut between its feet and hacks at it with its bill like a chisel.

A special adaptation is found in the tongue of the nutcracker. The tip of the tongue forks with two long pointed appendages which are keratinised into nail like surfaces. This is thought to help them handle and shell conifer seeds.

Surplus seed is always stored for later use and it is this species that is responsible for the sowing of new trees of their favoured pines, including the re-establishment of the Swiss pine (&quot;Pinus cembra&quot;) over large areas in the Alps of central Europe where it had formerly been cleared by human overcutting.

Various insects are also taken, and also small birds, their eggs and nestlings, small rodents and carrion such as roadkill. It digs out bumble bee and wasp nests avidly to get at the grubs.

===Breeding===

Nutcracker pairs stay together for life and their territory expands between 20 and 30 hectares. Nesting is always early in this species across its whole range, so as to make the best use of pine nuts stored the previous autumn. The nest is usually built high in a conifer (sometimes broadleaved trees are used) and usually on the sunny side. There are normally 2-4 eggs laid and incubated for 18 days. Both sexes feed the young which are usually fledged by about 23 days and stay with their parents for many months, following them to learn the food storage techniques essential for survival in their harsh environment.

==Distribution==
The northern nutcracker has an extensive range forming a broad swathe east–west from Scandinavia right across northern Europe, Siberia and to eastern Asia, including Japan, inhabiting the huge taiga conifer forests in the north.

Disjunct populations occur in mountain conifer forests further south, in the mountains of central and southeast Europe in the Alps, the Carpathians and the Balkan Peninsula mountains. See subspecies list above for race distributions. Some of the populations can be separated on bill size.

This species has a large range, extending over 10,000,000 km2 globally. It also has a large global population, with an estimate of between 800,000-1,700,000 individuals in Europe.

Northern nutcrackers are not migratory, but will erupt out of range when a cone crop failure leaves them short of a food supply, the thin-billed eastern race &quot;N. c. macrorhynchos&quot; being the most likely subspecies to do this. Britain records very sporadic vagrants, but in 1968 over 300 nutcrackers visited Britain as part of a larger irruption into western Europe, probably due to a spell of early cold weather in Siberia.

<text>Sir Colin Murray Campbell (26 December 1944 – 20 May 2022) was a British academic lawyer who was vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham from 1988 to 2008.

==Education and early career==
Campbell studied law at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with a first-class honours degree. After working at the University of Dundee and the University of Edinburgh, he was appointed professor of jurisprudence at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, where he was dean of the law faculty and a Pro Vice Chancellor.

==Vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham==
In 1988, Campbell was appointed to succeed Basil Weedon as vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham. At 43, he was the youngest university vice-chancellor in the country at the time. Over the next 20 years, he sought to raise the international profile of the university, oversaw the opening of the Jubilee Campus in Nottingham as well as the Ningbo campus in China and the Malaysia campus and greatly expanded both the facilities and student numbers at the university.

In 1994, he helped to establish the Russell Group of public research universities.

Campbell retired in September 2008, after 20 years running the university.

==Other interests==
Campbell was a member of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights for Northern Ireland, the Legal Aid Advisory Committee and the Mental Health Legislation Review Committee. He also chaired various committees of inquiry in Northern Ireland.

Campbell served on the University Grants Committee as vice-chair of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and as a board member of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. He was chair of the Northern Ireland Economic Council from 1987 to 1994, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority from 1990 to 1994, the Human Genetics Advisory Commission from 1996 to 1999 and the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee from 1991 to 2001. He was also a member of the Sheehy Inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards in 1992 and a member of the Trent Regional Health Authority from 1993 to 1996. He chaired the Food Advisory Committee from 1994 to 2001, and in 1999 he was appointed to the board of Swiss Re.

Campbell was also First Commissioner for Judicial Appointments until 2006.

==Legacy==

An influential but controversial figure, Campbell&#x27;s 20 years in charge of running the University of Nottingham were a pivotal time for the institution. According to one of his successors as vice-chancellor, Shearer West, &quot;he had a vision to grow the university not just through infrastructure, but through student numbers, reputation and by forging new links&quot;. The university registrar stated that &quot;so much of the university we know today would not be here without his influence&quot;. The university named the Colin Campbell Building at the Jubilee campus in his honour.

Campbell was knighted in 1994 and was made a deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in 1996. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was elected a member of the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences in 2000. He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Aberdeen in 2001. In September 2004, he was made an honorary citizen of Ningbo by the Standing Committee of the Ningbo Municipal People&#x27;s Congress in recognition of his contribution to the construction and development of the Ningbo campus. In April 2006, he received an honorary doctorate of law from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

===Criticism===
In 1999, Campbell caused much comment in the higher education sector by proposing the effective privatisation of universities, saying that what was good for telephone companies, railways and airlines must be good for academia too. He was long-term advocate of controversial plans to introduce tuition fees. He was criticised for the University of Nottingham&#x27;s decision in 2000 to accept, a £3.8 million endowment from British American Tobacco to establish an international centre for corporate social responsibility at the Nottingham University Business School. Many current and prospective staff at the university felt that the relationship with a tobacco company that had been accused, among other things, of illegal smuggling, trading with the Burmese junta, and illegally targeting its products at African children was highly unethical. This led to resignations, including that of Richard Smith, editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, the loss of at least one grant of £1.5 million from the Cancer Research Campaign and the decision of the director of a gene research group to take his 15-strong team to the University of London.

Further controversy arose in 2008 when Campbell issued a statement in response to the arrests under the Terrorism Act 2000 of a student, Rizwaan Sabir, and a member of staff, Hicham Yezza, at the University of Nottingham. They were held for six days before being released without charge after downloading documents relating to terrorism from a United States government website for research purposes. Appearing to reject the notion of academic freedom, Campbell said in his statement, &quot;There is no &#x27;right&#x27; to access and research terrorist materials. Those who do so run the risk of being investigated and prosecuted on terrorism charges. Equally, there is no &#x27;prohibition&#x27; on accessing terrorist materials for the purpose of research. Those who do so are likely to be able to offer a defence to charges (although they may be held in custody for some time while the matter is investigated).&quot; Many academic staff at the university found this legal formalism an unacceptable abdication of managerial responsibility, which demonstrated to some that Campbell, to the end, had always been more interested in cutting a figure as a businessman in tune with the establishment zeitgeist than defending and extending academic values.

Rod Thornton asserted that Campbell appeared to have lied in a public statement to &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; about the case when he claimed that the university had conducted a full risk assessment before reporting the matter to the police. Thornton asserted that this was contradicted by several other sources, including Campbell&#x27;s own version of events in his account to the Minister for Further and Higher Education. These sources suggested, in Thornton&#x27;s view, that the university had never carried out such a process.

Shortly before retiring, Campbell received a 90% pay increase, which saw him receive a salary and benefits package worth £585,000. This made him the highest-earning university vice-chancellor in the United Kingdom. Upon his retirement, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called him &quot;The Sir Alex Ferguson of Vice Chancellors&quot;.

<text>The V&amp;A Waterfront is a mixed-use suburb in Cape Town, South Africa. 

It is on the site of the oldest working harbour in the Southern Hemisphere. With Table Mountain as its backdrop, the 123-hectare neighbourhood sees millions of people visiting each year. It contains art, entrepreneurs, and sustainable design.

== Name ==
The V&amp;A Waterfront (Victoria and Alfred Waterfront) is named after Prince Alfred and Queen Victoria, members of the Royal Family of Britain when Cape Town was part of the Cape Colony. Alfred, while serving in the British Royal Navy, visited Cape Town and ordered construction of a new harbour for the colony.

==Properties==
The V&amp;A Waterfront is a mixed-use property that contains:

* 180 business tenants
* 450+ shops
* 101 entertainment activities
* 80+ eateries
* 13 hotels
* Seven museums
* 22 historical landmarks
* 15 conference venues
==History==



The V&amp;A Waterfront is a central part of the very beginning of the settlement of the city of Cape Town. In 1654, two years after his arrival in this relatively safe bay at the foot of Table Mountain, Jan van Riebeeck built a small jetty as part of his task to establish a refreshment station at the Cape. Fresh water and fresh produce were provided to the ships of the Dutch East India Company on their arduous and lengthy journey to their outposts in Java and Batavia. The sea and the harbour lie at the heart of Cape Town&#x27;s history.

In June 1858, serious winter storms, which were a common occurrence, wrecked over 30 vessels. As a consequence, Lloyds of London refused to cover ships spending the winter in Table Bay. On a sunny day in September 17, 1860 Midshipman HRH Prince Alfred, Queen Victoria&#x27;s second son, tipped the first load of stone to start construction of the breakwater for Cape Town&#x27;s first harbour to make it a safe haven all year round for passing ships.

In 1984, Sol Kreiner, Mayor of Cape Town, advanced what would become the V&amp;A Waterfront by forming a steering committee to consider a waterfront scheme: &quot;As Johannesburg has gold, we have a beautiful city as a tourist attraction and we must all work together for a better Cape Town. We have a large cross-section of people who are prepared to sit down and discuss a scheme which will bring back the old city where one can freely walk around, visit the harbour, go for tug rides and learn more about our heritage.&quot; Kreiner later became the council-nominated director on the board of the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront Company.

==Harbour expansion and reclamation==

The discovery of gold and diamonds in South Africa meant that the first section of harbour, the Alfred Basin, was not large enough to accommodate the increased number of ships, and the Victoria Basin was built. The construction of these two harbour basins took place between 1860 and 1920, and this area of the harbour still has an array of outstanding heritage buildings from this era.

In 1938 work was started to reclaim land between the city centre and the harbour, most notably the new Duncan Dock. The Foreshore (230 hectares) made city expansion possible. In the early 20th century, South Africa depended mainly on imports for many basic articles in daily use, which explains the importance of the harbour to the people who lived here.

==The Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront today==
In November 1988, Victoria and Alfred Waterfront (Pty) Ltd was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary by Transnet Ltd. Its aim was to redevelop the historic docklands around the Victoria and Alfred Basins as a mixed-use area with a focus on retail, tourism and residential development with a working harbour at its centre.

Today it is a mixed-use development that spans 23 hectares, with 24 million visitors a year. Over 23 000 people work and live within its neighbourhood.

==Neighbourhood==
The V&amp;A Waterfront has several distinct districts.

===Canal District===

This urban district connects the V&amp;A waterfront to the City of Cape Town. The area contains Battery Park, and a spa and showroom at Waterway House.

===Clocktower District===
Contains a clock tower built in 1882, a retail mall, and the Nelson Mandela Gateway to Robben Island ferry terminal.

===Granger Bay District===
Contains The Lookout events space, The Grand Beach Cafe, the Breakwater residential development, the Oranjezicht City Farm Market, and boardwalks with ocean views.

===Portswood Ridge District===
This district connects the V&amp;A waterfront and the Atlantic Seaboard, and includes the UCT Graduate School of Business, a golf course, the corporate offices and Deloitte HQ, and an urban garden.

===Silo District===
This district includes the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, the Southern Guild design gallery, restaurants, bars, hotels and office space. It sits next to the Cape Town Cruise Terminal, which also houses Makers Landing, a home for budding food entrepreneurs showcasing a mix of South African cuisine.

===South Arm District===
This district contains industrial space, and a harbour where fishing industries operate. Commercial vessels also berth at this harbour.

== Developments ==
The V&amp;A Waterfront has seen development in the Silo district, which currently houses the headquarters of Allan Gray Investment Management at Silo 1 and apartments at Silo 2. The project was completed in 2017 with a Virgin Active gym, the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, and the adjoining ultra-luxury Silo Hotel.

<text>Paula Preradović (; 12 October 1887 – 25 May 1951), known professionally as Paula von Preradović or by her married name as Paula Molden, was an Austrian writer and poet of Croatian descent. 

She was the granddaughter of the Croatian poet, writer and military general Petar Preradović. Paula Preradović was born in Vienna, but her family moved to Pula, Istria, in 1889. Later she lived in Copenhagen and again in Vienna. She was married to the journalist, diplomat and founder of the Austrian newspaper &quot;Die Presse&quot;, Ernst Molden, and had two sons, the publicist and federalist Otto Molden (1918–2002), and the journalist (1924–2014).

She composed the lyrics for the national anthem of Austria, &quot;Land der Berge, Land am Strome&quot;, in 1947; Preradović is one of the few women to have composed such an anthem.

Preradović died in Vienna in 1951 and is buried at the Zentralfriedhof.

<doc id="471904" wikidata="Q741814" url="?curid=471904" title="Panama hat">
<text>An Ecuadorian hat, also known as a Panama hat, a Jipijapa hat, or a toquilla straw hat, is a traditional brimmed straw hat of Ecuadorian origin. Traditionally, hats were made from the plaited leaves of the &quot;Carludovica palmata&quot; plant, known locally as the &quot;toquilla palm&quot; or &quot;Jipijapa palm&quot;, although it is a palm-like plant rather than a true palm.

Ecuadorian hats are light-colored, lightweight, and breathable, and often worn as accessories to summer-weight suits, such as those made of linen or silk. The tightness, the finesse of the weave, and the time spent in weaving a complete hat out of the toquilla straw characterize its quality. Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, these hats became popular as tropical and seaside accessories owing to their ease of wear and breathability.

The art of weaving the traditional Ecuadorian toquilla hat was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists on 5 December 2012.

== History ==
Although commonly called &quot;Panama hat&quot; in English, the hat has its origin in Ecuador. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Ecuador in 1526, the inhabitants of its coastal areas were observed to wear a brimless hat that resembled a toque, which was woven from the fibres from a palm tree that the Spaniards came to call &quot;paja toquilla&quot; or &quot;toquilla straw&quot;.
Beginning in the early to mid 1600s, hat weaving evolved as a cottage industry along the Ecuadorian coast as well as in small towns throughout the Andean mountain range. Hat weaving and wearing grew steadily in Ecuador through the 17th and 18th centuries.

One of the first towns to start weaving the hats in the Andes is Principal, part of the Chordeleg Canton in the Azuay province. Straw hats woven in Ecuador, like many other 19th- and early 20th-century South American goods, were shipped first to the Isthmus of Panama before sailing for their destinations in Asia, the rest of the Americas and Europe, subsequently acquiring a name that reflected their point of international sale—&quot;Panama hats&quot;—rather than their place of domestic origin.

Usage of the term &quot;Panama hat&quot; can be found in publications by 1828.
In 1835, Manuel Alfaro arrived in Montecristi to make his name and fortune in Panama hats. He set up a Panama hat business with his main objective being exportation. Cargo ships from Guayaquil and Manta were filled with his merchandise and headed to the Gulf of Panama. His business prospered with the onset of the California gold rush in the mid-19th century, as prospectors who took a sea-route to California had to travel overland at the Isthmus of Panama and needed a hat for the sun, and export of woven straw hats from Ecuador/Panama to the United States also increased to 220,000 per year by 1850.

In 1906, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the construction site of the Panama Canal and was photographed wearing a Panama hat, which further increased the hats&#x27; popularity. 
In the 1920s and 1930s, shifting public preferences towards lighter, more durable hats helped the fedora-like Panama eclipse the strawboater as the summer hat of choice.

Although the Panama hat continues to provide a livelihood for thousands of Ecuadorians, fewer than a dozen weavers capable of making the finest &quot;Montecristi superfinos&quot; remain. Ecuadorian companies like K. Dorfzaun and Andes Munay have specialized in exporting genuine Panama hats and supplying designer and retail brands with high quality accessories made by hand. These companies help communities sustain their traditions and intangible cultural heritage. Even though Chinese companies have been producing Panama hats at a cheaper price, the quality of the product cannot be compared with the Ecuadorian toquilla palm hats.

Many people wear light-colored Ecuadorian hats with linen or silk summer clothes in the summer. A toquilla straw hat is exceptional because of its tight weave, delicate construction, and lengthy manufacturing process (Henderson 1). These hats were commonplace in tropical and coastal settings around the turn of the century because of their lightweight design and ability to keep the wearer cool.

In the Chordeleg Canton of Azuay, the Principal was one of the first Andean settlements to produce hats. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Ecuador&#x27;s straw hats found their way to Asia, the Americas, and Europe through the Panama Canal (Henderson 5). Despite popular belief, Panama hats are not originally from Panama.

=== Tamsui hat ===
The tamsui hat was a straw hat made in Formosa (now Taiwan) to directly compete with the Panama in the early 20th century. Tamsui hats were made from &quot;Pandanus odoratissimus&quot; fibre, which grew plentifully on the island. As they retained their whiteness, were washable, and could be folded and carried about without damage, Tamsui hats replaced the rather costlier Panama in East Asia in the early 20th century.

== Construction ==
The two main processes in the creation of a Panama hat are weaving and blocking. The two most common types of weaves are the &quot;cuenca&quot; and &quot;brisa&quot;. The &quot;cuenca&quot; weave has the appearance of a herringbone pattern and utilizes slightly more straw than the &quot;brisa&quot; weave. The &quot;brisa&quot; weave has the appearance of small diamonds/squares. This type of weave is less intricate but perceived as finer than the &quot;cuenca&quot; weave by some as it is lighter. Other types of weaves include the &quot;crochet&quot;, &quot;fancy&quot;, &quot;torcido&quot;, and &quot;new order.&quot;

The quality of a Panama hat is defined by the tightness of the weave. The fine weave of the hat was ideal for protection against the tropical sun. Historically, to measure the tightness of the weave, a simple square tool that looks like a picture frame was used. The aperture of this frame was 25 mm, or about 1 inch. The regulator would set this frame one inch from the edge of the hat&#x27;s brim edge, and then count the peaks of the cross weaves, called &quot;carerra,&quot; moving in a parallel direction. The tighter the weave, the more &quot;carerras&quot; were counted. That number would be multiplied by two and reconciled against a grading chart. A highly refined grade 20 would consist of 16 &quot;carerras&quot;. The price of these hats depends on the time and quality that a weaver put in to the hat. A master weaver could take as long as eight months to weave a single hat. Weavers could sell a single hat to buyers for US$200. Once the hat is sold to a buyer it then would pass through more people who would &quot;finish the brim, shape it, remove imperfections, bleach the straw, and add interior and exterior brands.&quot; After this one hat has been through at least six people it can then be sold outside of Ecuador for $450 to $10,000. The best hats can sell for up to fifty times more than one weaver is paid for eight months of work.

The best quality hats are known as &quot;Montecristis&quot;, after the town of Montecristi, Ecuador, where they are produced. The rarest and most expensive Panama hats are hand-woven with up to 3000 weaves per square inch. In February 2014, Simon Espinal, an Ecuadorian 47-year-old Panama hat weaver considered to be among the best at his craft, set a world record by creating a Panama hat with four thousand weaves per square inch that took eight months to handcraft from beginning to end.

According to popular lore, a &quot;superfino&quot; Panama hat can hold water, and, when rolled up, pass through a wedding ring.

== Name ==
Despite their name, Panama hats originated in Ecuador where they are made to this day. Historically, throughout Central and South America, people referred to Panama hats as &quot;Jipijapa&quot;, &quot;Toquilla&quot;, or &quot;Montecristi&quot; hats (the latter two phrases are still in use today). Their designation as Panama hats originated in the 19th century, when Ecuadorian hat makers emigrated to Panama, where they were able to achieve much greater trade volumes.

Ecuador&#x27;s low tourism and international trade levels during the 1850s prompted hat makers to take their crafts to the busy trade center of Panama. There, the hat makers were able to sell more hats than they ever could in Ecuador. The hats were sold to gold prospectors traveling through Panama to California during the historic Californian Gold Rush. Travelers would tell people admiring their hats that they bought them in Panama. So, the hats quickly became known as &quot;Panama hats&quot;.

Soon after at the 1855 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, Panama hats were featured for the first time on a global scale. However, the Fair&#x27;s catalog did not mention Ecuador as its country of origin. It listed this type of hat as a &quot;cloth hat&quot; even though it was clearly not made out of cloth.
The name &quot;Panama hat&quot; was further reinforced by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s trip to oversee the construction of the Panama Canal. Roosevelt used his natural ability to drum up publicity by posing for a series of photos at the Panama Canal construction site in 1906. Photographic technology was relatively new at the time, and President Roosevelt was not shy about using the press to his advantage. Photos of his visit showed a strong, rugged leader dressed crisply in light-colored suits sporting Ecuadorian-made straw Panama hats.

<text>Anthony Francis Martin (born 10 June 1964) is a New Zealand comedian, writer and actor, who has had a successful TV, radio, stand-up and film career in Australia.

== Career ==

===1980s===
A former stand-up comedian and commercial voice-over-man, Tony Martin moved to Brisbane, Australia, from New Zealand when he was 21 to work as a radio copywriter. Having worked in radio and amateur theatre back in NZ, Martin approached the ABCTV&#x27;s &quot;The D-Generation&quot; in 1986 to work as a writer only to be told that filming on the first series had been completed. In the interim, he was invited to work as a researcher on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Gillies Republic&quot; which was the follow-up to the highly successful political satire &quot;The Gillies Report&quot; (1984–85). The show was not a success but Martin learnt a considerable amount from the production&#x27;s mistakes, and made his Australian TV debut as &#x27;Man in Bad Suit&#x27; in episode 4. He was also able to observe the production of the last few episodes of the 1986 ABC-TV live sketch-comedy show &quot;While You&#x27;re Down There&quot; which starred Richard Stubbs and Glenn Robbins and it was on the set that he met D-Gen member Tom Gleisner. Following that, Martin was employed for a short period as a puppeteer on the ABC-TV political satire &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; which featured rubber puppet-caricatures of famous politicians created by artist Peter Nicholson (Martin also did the voice of Joh Bjelke-Petersen). Martin was on the verge of heading back home to New Zealand when he was invited to be a writer for the second series of &quot;The D-Generation&quot; in 1987. He also made short appearances on the show, and featured on the 1989 spin-off album, &quot;The Satanic Sketches&quot;. Martin began to take on a more prominent role when the D-Generation produced four comedy specials for Network Seven in 1988–89, including doing one of the voices for &#x27;DeGenocide&#x27; where clips of the old Australian TV crime series &quot;Homicide&quot; were dubbed over with funny lines. Martin became a bona fide D-Gen member when he began writing and performing on the troupe&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; on Triple M Melbourne radio (1987–1992), which led to the 1990 compilation album &quot;The Breakfast Tapes&quot;. On air, Martin was frequently referred to by the other D-Gen members as &quot;The Fat Man.&quot; Along with Rob Sitch, Martin left the radio show a little earlier than the other members to prepare The D-Gen&#x27;s next venture for ABC TV (although he did make time to host &quot;Bulltwang&quot;, a Sunday Night radio show on Triple M with Mick Molloy, which ran for sixteen weeks in 1990).

===1990s===
Instantly recognisable as the &quot;tall skinny guy with glasses,&quot; Martin was one of the most valuable members of the D-Gen as a writer and performer on &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1992–1993). His co-introductions to almost every episode and &quot;Street Interviews&quot; segment highlighted his effective comedic partnership with Mick Molloy. Noted for his quick wit and passion for mimicry, Martin also appeared in countless &quot;Late Show&quot; sketches (including sleazy filmmaker Warren Perso in the classic sketch: &quot;The Last Australian Auteur&quot;), and provided the voices of Senior Sergeant Bargearse in the serial &quot;Bargearse&quot; (dubbed episodes of &quot;Bluey&quot;) and Governor Frontbottom and Judge Muttonchops in the serial &quot;The Olden Days&quot; (dubbed episodes of &quot;Rush&quot;). Martin compiled all three volumes of &quot;The Best Bits of The Late Show&quot; with Santo Cilauro and Wayne Marx, and also co-produced the &quot;dangerously overstuffed&quot; double DVD set, &quot;The Best Bits of The Late Show: Champagne Edition&quot;, which was released in 2001.

After &quot;The Late Show&quot; finished, Martin and Mick Molloy went on to develop and perform their top-rating national radio programme &quot;Martin/Molloy&quot;, which produced three ARIA award-winning compilation albums: &quot;The Brown Album&quot; (1995), &quot;Poop Chute&quot; (1996) and &quot;Eat Your Peas&quot; (1998).

===2000s===
Martin made several guest appearances on &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;The Mick Molloy Show&quot; (reprising his &quot;Street Interview&quot; skills), &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; (as Magda Szubanski&#x27;s fiddle-playing boyfriend), and &quot;Welcher and Welcher&quot;. In 2004, Tony Martin and Shaun Micallef began work on a TV sketch comedy series for the ABC with the working title &quot;Mouse-Patrol&quot; but after they wrote enough material for the first three episodes, the project was cancelled by management, much to Martin&#x27;s disappointment who commented in an interview in 2009 that the un-filmed scripts contained the best sketch stuff he had written for TV.

On 3 April 2006, Martin returned to the Austereo network to produce a nationally syndicated show with Ed Kavalee and Richard Marsland on Triple M named &quot;Get This&quot;. Although &quot;Get This&quot; was a ratings success and developed a dedicated legion of fans, on 16 October 2007 Triple M announced that the show would be axed, so the network could focus company attention and resources on new breakfast shows debuting across the country such as The Shebang in Sydney and a new, multimillion-dollar Melbourne-based show presented by Peter Helliar and Myf Warhurst, both of which were ironically also cancelled by Triple M over the next couple of years. Towards the end of the show&#x27;s run, a gathering of about 170 devoted fans took place outside the Triple M studios in Melbourne on 5 November 2007 to protest against the cancellation of the program. The last episode was aired 23 November 2007.

Martin wrote an online column called &quot;Scarcely Relevant&quot; at The Scrivener&#x27;s Fancy which was updated weekly 2009–2011. The website was placed on hiatus in June 2011 so Martin could concentrate on his latest TV project. The site was closed in November 2011. As of June 2012, the archived columns are available to download as an ebook.

Martin has directed episodes of ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Librarians&quot;, and, since 2008, has co-hosted shifts on 3RRR with Tony Wilson as &quot;The Two Tones&quot;.

===2010s===
After a successful guest appearance on &quot;Sunday Arts&quot; (ABC-TV) in 2009 in which he interviewed US writer &amp; lecturer Robert McKee, Martin commenced working on a new programme called &quot;A Quiet Word With ...&quot; which began airing on ABC1 on 28 September 2010. Rather than being a conventional celebrity-interview show, the programme featured Martin having relaxed and informal conversations with comedians and performers that he admired, and in some cases, had worked with during his own career. The first two episodes, featuring English comedian Bill Bailey and US actor and writer Carrie Fisher, were aired, respectively, in September and November 2010. The remaining ten episodes were screened weekly on ABC1 from 2 April 2011, beginning with British actor and comedian Alan Davies, and concluding on 4 June 2011 with British actor and writer Richard E Grant.

In February 2011, Martin appeared as one of the regulars on the radio-comedy programme &quot;The Lonely Hearts Club&quot; which was broadcast weekly on ABC Radio National on Saturday nights from 10 pm to midnight. The show, delivered in a deadpan, straight fashion, featured an un-credited Martin appearing under the pseudonym of 39-year-old Duncan Jardine, one of Australia&#x27;s most successful second-unit directors. The first episode was broadcast on 12 February 2011 and the eighth and final episode was heard on 2 April 2011.

In December 2010, the Nine Network announced that Martin would be reunited with his former co-host on &quot;Get This&quot;, Ed Kavalee, for an upcoming comedy show entitled &quot;The Joy of Sets&quot;. This comedy television series looking at the elements used to construct television shows, commenced screening on 20 September 2011 in the 9:00 pm Tuesday timeslot on Nine. The debut episode rated well but audience figures declined for the subsequent episodes, prompting Channel 9 to move the show to a later timeslot of 10.30pm midway through the series. The eighth and final episode aired on 8 November 2011.

In late 2012, Martin co-directed (with Wayne Hope) episodes of a new eight-part comedy series &quot;Upper Middle Bogan&quot;, filmed on location in Melbourne and which aired on ABC-TV in August 2013. The series was created and written by Hope and Robyn Butler of Gristmill Productions who also created &quot;The Librarians&quot; and &quot;Very Small Business&quot;. Martin later directed episodes of the second series of the show in 2014.

In 2013, Martin announced via Twitter that he was in the UK working as a co-writer on Ross Noble&#x27;s new comedy-travelogue programme &quot;Freewheeling&quot; which aired on the UK comedy channel Dave. Back home, Martin made a return to live comedy with his show &quot;The Yeti&quot; opening at the Melbourne Fringe Festival in September 2013. In 2015, Martin performed at the Melbourne Fringe with his show &quot;The Arse/Elbow Equation&quot; which he later performed at Brisbane Arts Theatre in early 2016.

Martin and writer &amp; editor Sarina Rowell, in 2014, began writing a new sitcom &quot;Childproof&quot; about a young couple who decide not to have children. But after three years of pitching the idea, Martin and Rowell were unable to sell the project to any of the TV networks. Instead in September 2017, Martin and comedian Geraldine Quinn recorded the scripts as a live podcast at the Melbourne Fringe Festival and was later downloadable for free.

In May 2016, Martin joined the Breakfast show on Nova 100, initially as a temporary replacement for regular co-host Sam Pang, but he currently appears weekly as a guest co-host. Since 2017, Martin has also appeared as a regular co-host on Ed Kavalee&#x27;s &quot;T.E.A.M Effort&quot; podcast. and has been a guest vocalist for Damian Cowell&#x27;s Disco Machine, appearing on both the latter&#x27;s self-titled 2015 album and their 2017 album &quot;Get Yer Dag On&quot;. Martin&#x27;s first novel &quot;Deadly Kerfuffle&quot; was published by Affirm Press in October 2017. In May 2018, Martin &amp; producer Matt Dower began releasing a new fortnightly comedy podcast &quot;Sizzletown&quot; which by mid-August had achieved over 160,000 downloads.

===Movies===
Martin played the part of &quot;intrigued school child&quot; in the 1977 movie &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. Martin wrote, produced and directed the 2003 comedy movie &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; (in which he also made a cameo appearance as a game show host), and wrote and directed the unreleased 2007 mockumentary &quot;BoyTown Confidential&quot;. He has also played minor roles in several films (mostly those of former &quot;Late Show&quot; colleagues), including &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997), &quot;Tackle Happy&quot; (2000), &quot;Crackerjack&quot; (2002) and &quot;BoyTown&quot; (2006). More recently, he has had roles in two films made by his former &quot;Get This&quot; co-host Ed Kavalee: &quot;Scumbus&quot; (2012) and &quot;Border Protection Squad&quot; (2012).

===Books===
Martin&#x27;s first book, &quot;Lolly Scramble&quot;, a collection of humorous autobiographical essays, was published in 2005.
Martin&#x27;s second book, &quot;A Nest of Occasionals&quot;, was released in October 2009. The latter book, re-printed in a second edition in April 2011, was voted as the best work of Australian comedy in any medium in 2009 by the comedy review website Australian Tumbleweeds
A third book was released online in 2012, downloadable as an ebook on tonymartinthings.com, called &quot;Scarcely Relevant&quot;, a collection of Martin&#x27;s columns from the now closed Scriveners Fancy website. &quot;Deadly Kerfuffle&quot;, Martin&#x27;s first novel, was published in 2017. &quot;Deadly Kerfuffle&quot; was shortlisted for the 2019 Russell Prize.

== Personal life ==
Martin grew up in the small New Zealand towns of Te Kūiti and Thames. For two years as a child, he lived on a boat for five months of the year as his father was a part-time amateur marlin fisherman. Since there was no TV, he would listen to radio programs like &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and try to copy the voices.

Martin married Annie Maver, a floor manager on &quot;The Panel&quot; and &quot;RocKwiz&quot;, who has worked as an assistant director in Australian movies and television productions. He met her when she was a floor manager on &quot;The D-Generation&quot;. They are now divorced.

In his spare time, Martin is currently on a venture to walk every street in Melbourne which he embarked upon in 2009. &quot;Nine News&quot; aired a story on his project in August 2017.

<text>This is a List of Fleet Air Arm aircraft squadrons. The primary organisational structure for aerial operations within the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) is represented by squadrons. These include frontline combat squadrons which were designated with the numerical ranges of 800-899, 1700-1799, and 1800-1899. In contrast, the numerical range of 700-799 was allocated for training and support squadrons.

Established on 1 April 1924, the Fleet Air Arm included all Royal Air Force aircraft that were deployed from aircraft carriers and other naval vessels. On 24 May 1939, the administrative management of the Fleet Air Arm, which serves as the naval aviation branch of the Royal Navy, was transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Admiralty as a result of the &quot;Inskip Award&quot;. At the beginning of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm comprised merely twenty squadrons.

Squadrons presented in bold typeface are presently operational within the Royal Navy&#x27;s naval aviation component, the Fleet Air Arm. Squadrons in underline subsequently commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm. Squadrons in &quot;italics&quot; subsequently commissioned into the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service. Squadrons subsequently transferred to or formed within the Royal Canadian Navy are denoted with the suffix RCN in their title.

== Royal Air Force ==

With the formation of the Fleet Air Arm in 1924, as a part of the Royal Air Force, blocks of squadron numbers were used. Numbers 401-439 were Fleet Fighter / Spotter Flights, assigned to Royal Navy battleships and cruisers. Numbers 440-459 were Fleet Reconnaissance Flights, many later becoming Fleet Spotter Reconnaissance Flights, and Number 460 onwards, as Fleet Torpedo Flights, later becoming Torpedo Bomber Flights.

The 700 and 800 series numbers were designated for squadrons within the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force, following the consolidation of the Fleet Air Arm flights into squadrons beginning in 1933. Upon the transfer of the Fleet Air Arm management to the Admiralty, this series of squadron numbers was subsequently adopted, resulting in no further allocation of numbers from this block to Royal Air Force squadrons.

== Royal Navy ==

The 700 and 800 series numbers were retained when the Admiralty regained full control of the Fleet Air Arm in 1939.

=== Numbering and role ===

Numbers 700-749 were for catapult flights and squadrons, but eventually these all merged into 700 Naval Air Squadron, leaving Numbers 701-710 for amphibian and floatplane squadrons from 1943 onwards. Numbers 750-799, were assigned for training and ancillary squadrons (&quot;in contrast to the RAF practice at the time of not assigning squadron numbers to training units&quot;).

Front line combat squadrons were Numbers 800-899 and broken down into categories: Numbers 800-809 were allocated for fighter squadrons, numbers 810-819 were for torpedo bomber squadrons, then later torpedo spotter reconnaissance (TSR) squadrons and torpedo bomber reconnaissance (TBR) squadrons, Numbers. 820-859 were initially spotter reconnaissance squadrons, then later becoming TSR squadrons and finally, TBR squadrons. Originally, TBR squadrons included numbers 860-869, but these were assigned to Dutch-crewed and then Royal Netherlands Navy squadrons. Numbers 870-899 were initially for single-seat fighter squadrons, but numbers 870-879 were later assigned to the Royal Canadian Navy squadrons. As these numbers ran out, new series prefixed by &#x27;1&#x27; were allocated. Leaving aside unused blocks, Numbers 1700-1749 became torpedo bomber reconnaissance squadrons and two-seat fighter squadrons were numbers 1770-1799. Dive bomber squadrons were numbers 1810-1829 and numbers 1830-1899 were for single-seat fighter squadrons.

== Front Line Squadrons (Nos. 800 to 899) ==

Squadrons presented in bold typeface are presently operational within the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. Those indicated with an underline have been subsequently commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm. Squadrons &quot;italicized&quot; have been later commissioned into the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service. Additionally, squadrons that have been transferred to or established within the Royal Canadian Navy are identified by the suffix RCN in their designation.

=== Nos. 800 to 809 ===
Single-seat fighter squadrons for aircraft carriers.
=== Nos. 810 to 819 ===
Torpedo Bomber squadrons for aircraft carriers, then later Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance and Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance squadrons.
=== Nos. 820 to 859 ===
Spotter Reconnaissance Squadrons, later Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance and Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance squadrons.

Note: 839, 843, 844, 858 and 859 Naval Air Squadrons did not form.

=== Nos. 860 to 869 ===
Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance squadrons; Later reserved for Dutch-crewed and then Royal Netherlands Navy squadrons.

Note: 862-869 Naval Air Squadrons did not form.

=== Nos. 870 to 879 ===
Single-seat fighter squadrons. Nos. 870-879 were reserved for use by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1951.

Note: Nos. 872-876 Naval Air Squadrons did not form.

=== Nos. 1750 to 1769 ===
Single-seat fighter squadrons (not adopted).

=== Nos. 1770 to 1799 ===
Two-seat fighter squadrons.

Note: Nos. 1773-1789 and 1793-1799 were never formed. Nos. 1773 to 1775 Squadrons were planned to form in 1945 for the British Pacific Fleet, but this never transpired.

== Front Line Squadrons (Nos. 1800 to 1899) ==

=== Nos. 1800 to 1809 ===

Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance units (not adopted).

Note: Nos. 1854-1899 were never formed. The Reserve Squadrons later used Nos. 1830-1836 and 1840-1844 for Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Air Branch squadrons and Nos. 1831 and 1832 were Royal Naval Reserve Air Branch squadrons.

== Second Line Squadrons (Nos. 700 to 799) ==
Squadrons presented in bold typeface are presently operational within the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. Squadrons in underline subsequently commissioned into Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm. Squadrons that have been transferred to or established within the Royal Canadian Navy are identified by the suffix RCN in their designation.

=== Nos. 700 to 749 ===
Initially designated for Catapult flights, the area later evolved into catapult squadrons. Following the dissolution of these squadrons, the range was repurposed for training and support squadrons. Numbers 700 to 710 were designated for the utilisation of amphibian and floatplane squadrons in 1943; however, this designation was subsequently discontinued. When these ceased to exist the range became available for training and ancillary squadrons.
=== Nos. 750 to 799 ===
Numbers 750 to 799 were allocated for training and support squadrons.
== Reserve Squadrons ==
Nos. 1830 to 1836 and 1840 to 1844 were designated for the squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Air Branch during the period from 1947 to 1957 and subsequently formed into five divisions from 1952.

<text>The Surinamese dollar (ISO 4217 code &quot;SRD&quot;) has been the currency of Suriname since 2004. It is divided into 100 &quot;cent&quot;. The Surinamese dollar is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign &quot;$&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Sr$&quot; to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. In spoken Surinamese Dutch, it is widely referred to by its acronym SRD (), with &quot;dollar&quot; generally being understood as meaning the US dollar.

==History==
The dollar replaced the Surinamese guilder on 1 January 2004, with one dollar equal to 1,000 guilders. Initially, only coins were available, with banknotes delayed until mid-February, reportedly due to a problem at the printer, the Canadian Bank Note Company.

The old coins denominated in cents (i.e. guilder) were declared to be worth their face value in the new cents, negating the necessity of producing new coins. Thus, for example, an old 25-cent coin, previously worth guilder, was now worth dollar (equivalent to 250 guilders). The rebasing of coins explicitly did not apply to commemorative coins.

Amendment 121 of ISO 4217 gave the currency the code SRD replacing the Suriname guilder (SRG).

The people of Suriname often refer to their currency as SRD to differentiate it from the US dollar, which is also used to quote prices for electronic goods, household furnishings and appliances, and automobiles.

The value of the Surinamese dollar (SRD) was set by the central bank between 2004 and 2021. As a result, black market currency exchange thrived. The Central Bank of Suriname spent much of Suriname&#x27;s foreign currency reserves supporting the official exchange rates as inflation and other factors caused the real value of the Surinamese dollar to decline against other reserve currencies. In June 2021, the central bank devalued the SRD by 33% and announced the currency would float freely. By June 2022, official exchange rates began to reflect the real floating exchange rate.

;Historical official exchange rates of one U.S. dollar in Surinamese dollars

==Coins==
Coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 100 and 250 cents from the previous currency are in circulation.

==Banknotes==
The Surinamese dollar replaced the Surinamese guilder on 1 January 2004, with one dollar equal to 1,000 guilders, prompting the issuance of notes denominated in the new currency. On the notes, the currency is expressed in the singular, as is the Dutch custom. Banknotes come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 SRD.

Years of high inflation have greatly reduced the purchasing power of the Surinamese dollar. To ease handling of cash, banknotes of 200 and 500 SRD were announced in August 2023 and introduced by the end of March 2024.

<doc id="471915" wikidata="Q1224815" url="?curid=471915" title="Digital Subscriber System No. 1">
<text>Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 (DSS1) is a digital signalling protocol (D channel protocol) used for the ISDN. It is defined by ITU-T I.411 (ETS 300 102). It supports Bearer Capability, Low Level Compatibility and High Level Compatibility, ANI, DNIS and redirected number signaling in both directions. A standard developed by ETSI for Europe is known as Euro-ISDN or E-DSS1 or simply EDSS1 (European DSS1).

DSS1/EDSS1 protocol, in contrast, for example, to the protocol QSIG, was designed for use as access to public ISDN and asymmetric in the sense that it suggests a link with the network side at one end (digital public telephone exchange) and the user (private branch exchange (PBX)) - at the other.

Since the market for ISDN equipment was open, ETSI provided guidance to suppliers of ISDN equipment by means of the minimum requirements for inter-connectivity to ISDN networks. These documents, called NET3 for BRI and NET5 for PRI lines, described a set of protocol tests terminals should comply to.
Later, testing institutes, like KEMA in the Netherlands, implemented and performed the protocol tests and provided the appropriate certificates.

In 1989, 26 network operators from 20 European countries decided to develop EDSS1 as a pan-European standard to replace earlier national protocols (such as FTZ 1 TR 6 (Germany) or VN3 (France)). EDSS1 has been one of the keys to the success of the ISDN within European countries (as compared to, for example, the U.S.).

Non-European countries using DSS1 include Australia, Brazil, Iran, India, Israel, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Palestine, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates.

The DSS1 protocol knows four different codesets for information elements.
Codeset 0 regards to Q.931, Codeset 5 to the ETSI standard, Codeset 6 for national applications and Codeset 7 for PBX applications.
The most common Codeset is 0/Q.931.

<text>Pink Triangle Press is an independent, Canadian media organization specializing in LGBTQ2S+ journalism, television and online interactive media. Founded in 1971, Pink Triangle Press is one of the longest-publishing LGBTQ2S+ media groups in the world. Today, Pink Triangle Press publishes Xtra, an online magazine and community platform covering LGBTQ2S+ culture, politics and health. Pink Triangle Press also publishes a series of newsletters including &quot;Pink Ticket Travel&quot; and &quot;Wander+Lust&quot;. &quot;Pink Ticket Travel&quot; is a Queer travel newsletter featuring travel tips and guidelines for LGBTQ2S+ travelers. &quot;Wander+Lust&quot; is a newsletter featuring travel tips and tricks for gay and bi men, including insider recommendations and exclusive offers. 

==History==
Pink Triangle Press&#x27; roots trace back to 1971 (although not in name) in Toronto, when a group of volunteers began to produce &quot;The Body Politic&quot;, a paper containing news and opinions on gay liberation. By 1976 &quot;TBP&quot; was being published monthly, and in the early 1980s it claimed a circulation of over 9,000 nationally, and boasted contributions from writers all over the world.

In 1978, Pink Triangle Press was incorporated, its name was chosen as a symbol of history and commitment, as it comes from the symbols placed on suspected homosexual men in Nazi concentration camps. Later that year, PTP was charged with &quot;publishing immoral, indecent and scurrilous material&quot; because of an issue of &quot;The Body Politic&quot; which included Gerald Hannon&#x27;s article &quot;Men Loving Boys Loving Men&quot;. The Press was brought up on similar charges again in May 1982, this time for &quot;Lust With a Very Proper Stranger&quot;, an article on fisting. PTP however won both cases.

In an attempt to broaden PTP&#x27;s Toronto readership, the collective launched &quot;Xtra!&quot; in March 1984. &quot;Xtra!&quot; was meant to be more upbeat and accessible than TBP. By 1985 &quot;Xtra!&quot; had taken over its parent publication&#x27;s role of providing local entertainment and community event listings.

&quot;Xtra!&quot;&#x27;s circulation had soon overtaken TBP which was in financial trouble, so in an effort to save PTP and keep &quot;Xtra!&quot; going, TBP was discontinued in February 1987.

&quot;Xtra! West&quot; in Vancouver, later called &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot;, and &quot;Capital Xtra!&quot; in Ottawa, later called &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot;, were both launched in 1993.

In January 2015, the company announced that it was discontinuing publication of its print titles, with the final edition of &quot;Xtra!&quot; published on February 19. &quot;Xtra!&quot; will continue as a digital media publication via the &quot;Daily Xtra&quot; website.

==Other investments==

Pink Triangle Press launched Squirt.org in 1998, a Canadian-based cruising website for gay men. The website includes user-generated listings for parks, saunas and popular gay public sex locations.

In December 2023, Pink Triangle Press announced their partnership with the Canada Media Fund to advocate for LGBTQ2S+ professionals working in Canadian film, television, gaming and streaming industries. This includes the composition of a series of Pink Papers, which will be centered upon LGBTQ2S+ representation. 

In July 2004, Pink Triangle Press became a minority partner in PrideVision TV when the channel was sold by Headline Media Group to William Craig. PrideVision was subsequently rebranded OutTV and a new gay male adult subscription channel, HARDtv, was launched at the same time. PTP sold its interest in OutTV to majority partner Shavick Entertainment in December 2012.

Previous to PrideVision being sold, Pink Triangle Press became partners with television producer Les Tomlin, forming Bumper 2 Bumper Media Inc. which produces &quot;Bump!&quot;, the world&#x27;s first gay travel show, initially airing on PrideVision and now in production on a fifth season. Bump also recently launched a series of mobile travel guide apps for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Blackberry.

As well, Pink Triangle Press was a partner in Evanov Radio Group&#x27;s license application for 103.9 PROUD FM, a new radio station to serve Toronto&#x27;s LGBT community. PTP&#x27;s agreement with Evanov was discontinued in late 2005 after PTP expressed reservations about the depth of Evanov&#x27;s commitment to serving LGBT audiences.

Pink Triangle Press also operated a gay telephone personals service under the Cruiseline banner in all three cities where the &quot;Xtra!&quot; papers publish, as well as five other major Canadian centres across the country. UPDATE: March 2011, Pink Triangle Press sells Cruiseline to First Media Group.

In June 2006 Pink Triangle Press acquired Boston-based publication &quot;The Guide&quot;, an international gay travel magazine in existence for more than 25 years. PTP ceased printing The Guide in April 2010, and move to an online format only at Guidemag.com.

In February 2008 Pink Triangle Press acquired Toronto-based publication &quot;fab&quot;, a gay scene magazine which had previously been seen as &quot;Xtra!&quot;&#x27;s competition. On March 12, 2013, Pink Triangle Press announced that &quot;fab&quot; would be discontinued, with its final issue slated for publication on April 24.

In March 2017 Pink Triangle Press acquired the location based gay dating and social network app GuySpy. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition was part of Pink Triangle Press&#x27; growth strategy to expand into an entirely new segment through the GuySpy social network and mobile app. They instructed their users to delete the app and re-download it, in order to keep using the GuySpy service.

In 2024 the company launched the PTP Pink Awards, a program to honour significant builders of LGBTQ community and culture in Canada.

<text>Xtra Magazine (formerly DailyXtra and Xtra!) is an LGBTQ-focused digital publication and former print newspaper published by Pink Triangle Press in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The publication is a continuation of the company&#x27;s former print titles &quot;Xtra!&quot;, &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot;, and &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot;, which were all discontinued in 2015.

==History ==
&quot;Xtra&quot; was founded in Toronto on February 19, 1984 (with a March cover date) by Pink Triangle Press, a not-for-profit organization. It was introduced as a four-page tabloid, as a way to broaden PTP&#x27;s Toronto readership. Pink Triangle Press had previously published &quot;The Body Politic&quot;, which was discontinued in 1987. From 1990 to 2000, &quot;Xtra&quot; published a quarterly literary supplement, &quot;The Church-Wellesley Review&quot;, for work by LGBTQ2 fiction and poetry writers.

The company also launched a telephone dating personals service, Cruiseline, which later evolved into the contemporary web-based Squirt.org.

In 1993, &quot;Xtra&quot; expanded, adding &quot;Xtra! West&quot; in Vancouver and &quot;Capital Xtra!&quot; in Ottawa. The three &quot;Xtra&quot; papers also produced an annual &quot;Ultimate Pride Guide&quot; and an annual lesbian and gay business directory called &quot;Index&quot;. &quot;Xtra&quot; and &quot;Xtra! West&quot; were published biweekly, while &quot;Capital Xtra!&quot; was initially published as a monthly, with its publication frequency later expanding to every three weeks.

The Vancouver and Ottawa publications were renamed &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot; and &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; in the late 2000s, while the Toronto edition retained the name &quot;Xtra&quot;.

In 2010, due to the changing business climate for print publications, PTP closed the Ottawa offices, with the Ottawa edition of the publication published out of the Toronto office thereafter.

The final print issues of &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot; and &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; appeared on February 12, 2015, while the Toronto edition&#x27;s final print issue was published on the newspaper&#x27;s 31st anniversary, February 19, 2015. The publications continued online as a digital publication, initially under the name &quot;Daily Xtra&quot; before reverting to the &quot;Xtra Magazine&quot; name.

==Contributors==
Past contributors to the publications have included Lily Alexandre, Sandra Alland, Richard Burnett, Brenda Cossman, James Dubro, Gerald Hannon, Matthew Hays, Greg Kearney, Todd Klinck, Greg Kramer, R. W. Gray, Raziel Reid, Irshad Manji, Alex Munter, Rachel Giese, Brian Francis, Peter Knegt, and Jeffrey Round.

<text>Ramotswa is a village in South-East District of Botswana, southwest of the capital of Gaborone. The population was 27,760 in 2011 census.
It is the tribal capital of the BaLete, an ethnic majority springing from the Nguni tribe.

Ramotswa&#x27;s main industry is a wheat flour mill. The village also manufactures metal products.

Kgosi Mosadi Seboko of Ramotswa is the first woman to serve as a paramount chief in Botswana. Seboko took on her role as a village leader and representative to the House of Chiefs after her brother Kgosi Seboko II died in 2000. Her presence in the house of chiefs was hailed as a victory for women&#x27;s rights in southern Africa.

The nearby hamlet of Otse is the site for Moeding College, originally a colonial secondary school and a school for the disabled run by the Campbill Rankoromane Community educational center. Police XI, Botswana Premier League champions for 2006, are also based in Otse.

The climate is semi-arid, vegetation is a tree and shrub savanna. Only a fifth of the area is farmed but the density of cattle and goats and sheep is high.

Otse is overlooked by cliffs from which a colony of vultures are easily visible on most days.

On the outskirts of village lies Mothubakwane ward, where a prominent figure Tlotlo Oepeng lives. Other notable places include Siga ward, home to Killer Giants the local football club, Lesetlhana ward housing the central business district and Taung village where the industry lies.

When The BaLete first settled in Ramotswa remains a topic of much debate, as the local history is traditionally an oral one as with a lot of African villages and towns where the &#x27;infrustructure of urban development&#x27; is new. It however remains beyond dispute that residents of Ramotswa and surrounding areas have contributed much to the development of the region, and often bravely so in the context of the towns proximity to the much more &#x27;in the public eye&#x27; towns and cities of South Africa. There has seemingly always been and continues to be a unique blend of the very modern even in terms of advanced technologies and the firmly &#x27;locally old fashioned&#x27; in terms of lifestyle, as one might expect of a town in such close proximity to a capital of a country still largely in good standing (at least at last check) in the eyes of the world.

==Notable natives and residents==

* Mosadi Seboko, Motswana chief of the Balete people in Botswana
* Donald Thobega, football player
* Ofentse Nato, football player

<doc id="471933" wikidata="Q506052" url="?curid=471933" title="Teddy Wilson">
<text>Theodore Shaw Wilson (November 24, 1912 – July 31, 1986) was an American jazz pianist. Described by critic Scott Yanow as &quot;the definitive swing pianist&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s piano style was gentle, elegant, and virtuosic. His style was highly influenced by Earl Hines and Art Tatum. His work was featured on the records of many of the biggest names in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. With Goodman, he was one of the first black musicians to perform prominently alongside white musicians. In addition to his extensive work as a sideman, Wilson also led his own groups and recording sessions from the late 1920s to the 1980s.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Wilson was born in Austin, Texas. Under his parents as school teachers, his early music education began at the age 6 with piano. Then, he studied violin, oboe, and clarinet at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama.

=== From 1929 to the early 1930s ===
Wilson moved to Detroit with his brother, musician Gus Wilson. Teddy began his professional career in 1929 with Speed Webb&#x27;s band. Wilson then took over the pianist position of bandleader Milton Senior&#x27;s band from Art Tatum in 1930. After touring with the band in Chicago, he decided to stay in Chicago and worked with Louis Armstrong and his orchestra between 1931–1933. He also understudied Earl Hines in Hines&#x27;s Grand Terrace Cafe Orchestra before moving to New York to perform with Benny Carter&#x27;s Chocolate Dandies in 1933.

=== From the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s ===
In 1935, while jamming with Benny Goodman and Carl Bellinger at a house party held by Mildred Bailey, they caught the attention of producer John Hammond, who arranged several recording sessions for them. These recordings became the basis of the Benny Goodman Trio, which consisted of Goodman, Wilson, and drummer Gene Krupa (and, later, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton). The trio performed during the Goodman big band&#x27;s intermissions. By joining the trio, Wilson became one of the first black musicians to perform prominently in a racially integrated group.

Hammond was also instrumental in getting Wilson a contract with Brunswick Records from 1935 to 1939 to record hot swing arrangements of the popular songs of the day, with the growing jukebox trade in mind. During these years, he also took part in many sessions with swing musicians such as Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers, Red Norvo, Buck Clayton, and Ben Webster. 38 of his recordings have been hits and these are mostly chamber jazz recordings with singers such as Lena Horne, Helen Ward, Ella Fitzgerald, Mildred Bailey, and Billie Holiday. Among those vocals, Billie Holiday and Teddy Wilson made fourteen sides together in 1935 alone. From 1939 to 1942, he recorded for Columbia Records. He also left his residency with Goodman&#x27;s band and formed his own fifteen-piece big band in 1939, but it only lasted around a year due to the lack of individuality in his band. In 1944, he returned to his sidemen position in the Benny Goodman Sextet and his musical association with Goodman continued until 1962. In the mid to the late 1940s, Wilson mainly focused on studio recordings, on-screen performances, and radio broadcasts, instead of playing on public stages.

=== Café Society ===
After the demise of his big band, Wilson formed a sextet that performed at Café Society from 1940 to 1944. There, he led jazz shows called &quot;chamber jazz&quot; with a dance orchestra composed of himself, Frankie Newton, Ed Hall, and Billie Holiday. He was dubbed the &quot;Marxist Mozart&quot; by Howard &quot;Stretch&quot; Johnson due to his support for left-wing causes: he performed in benefit concerts for &quot;The New Masses&quot; journal and for Russian War Relief, and he chaired the Artists&#x27; Committee to elect Benjamin J. Davis (a New York City council member running on the Communist Party USA ballot line). Later, the FBI suspended Wilson&#x27;s performing activities on broadcast, radio, and social activities alleging that he was involved in Communism.

=== The late 1940s and 1950s ===
From 1945 to 1952, Wilson taught at the Juilliard School. After that, he toured across numerous countries in Europe, including Scandinavia, England, Scotland, Germany, Holland, and Switzerland. In the 1950s, he recorded for Verve Records. Wilson can also be seen appearing as himself in the motion pictures &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; (1955). He later worked as music director for the &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot;.

=== Later years ===
Wilson resided in suburban Hillsdale, New Jersey. He was married three times, including to the songwriter Irene Kitchings. He performed as a soloist and with pickup groups until the final years of his life, including leading a trio with his sons Theodore Wilson on bass and Steven Wilson on drums.

In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

He died of stomach cancer in New Britain, Connecticut, on July 31, 1986, aged 73. He is buried at Fairview Cemetery in New Britain. In addition to Theodore and Steven, Wilson had three more children, William, James (Jim) and Dune.

== Musical style ==
According to Wilson, he was first exposed to jazz by listening to the music of Duke Ellington, Earl Hines, Louis Armstrong, and Fats Waller. He then developed his own musical vocabulary based on the styles of Art Tatum and Earl Hines. When it comes to Tatum&#x27;s influence, Wilson&#x27;s fast right-hand runs can be traced to Tatum&#x27;s similar right-hand embellishments. However, Wilson&#x27;s playing focused on diatonic, &quot;inside&quot; harmonic ideas based on triads and extensions. He also pursued a style of improvisation based on lyrical melodic development. Furthermore, Wilson&#x27;s playing is characterized by consistent dynamic expression with an elegant touch. His fluid runs and gracefully relaxed rhythmic coordination with clean and even phrasing might have been reflected by his reserved personality and his experience with Benny Goodman under racial segregation. Teddy Wilson contributed to modernizing the pianistic articulation in contrast to the raw Harlem Stride Piano.

While adapting tenth voicing in his left hand and horn-like doubled-octave playing in the right hand from Earl Hines, he pursued a lighter and thinner texture with a relatively simple rhythmic ideas and a single melodic device than Hines.

Though he played with a lot of bebop musicians such as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie during his work as a sideman, he held on to swing vocabulary based on chord tone arpeggios and diatonic harmony. His playing on &quot;Congo Blues&quot; for Red Norvo and His Sextet in 1945, for examples, demonstrates the stylistic contrast between Wilson and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.

Wilson&#x27;s style went on to influence other pianists such as his contemporary Mary Lou Williams, Mel Powell, Billy Kyle, Jess Stacy, and Joe Bushkin.

<doc id="471937" wikidata="Q3039796" url="?curid=471937" title="Nordic folklore">
<text>Nordic folklore is the folklore of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. It has common roots with, and has been under mutual influence with, folklore in England, Germany, the Low Countries, the Baltic countries, Finland and Sápmi. Folklore is a concept encompassing expressive traditions of a particular culture or group. The peoples of Scandinavia are heterogenous, as are the oral genres and material culture that has been common in their lands. However, there are some commonalities across Scandinavian folkloric traditions, among them a common ground in elements from Norse mythology as well as Christian conceptions of the world.

Among the many tales common in Scandinavian oral traditions, some have become known beyond Scandinavian borders – examples include The Three Billy Goats Gruff and The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body.

== Legends ==
* Tróndur was a powerful Viking chieftain who lived in the Faroe Islands during the 9th century. According to legend, Tróndur was killed by a Christian missionary named Sigmundur Brestisson, who had come to the islands to spread Christianity. Tróndur&#x27;s legacy lives on in Faroese folklore, where he is often portrayed as a tragic hero.
* Risin and Kellingin are a pair of giants who are said to live on the island of Eysturoy. They are said to be very large and strong, and they are often depicted as being angry and destructive.
* Skógafoss is a waterfall located in the south of Iceland, and is home to a number of folk tales, including one about hidden treasure that is said to be buried at the base of the waterfall by Þrasi Þórólfsson.
* Reynisfjara is a black sand beach located in the south of Iceland. It is known for its towering basalt columns and its sea stacks. The beach is also home to a number of folk tales, including one about a pair of trolls who were turned to stone by the sun.

== Traditions ==

* Grindadráp: This traditional whaling practice is deeply rooted in the cultural history and mythology of the Faroe Islands and has been a significant part of their way of life for centuries. The Grindadráp is associated with various customs, beliefs, and rituals, including the importance of communal cooperation and the sharing of resources. However, the Grindadráp is also a contested and controversial practice in modern times, with concerns about its impact on animal welfare and sustainability.
* Íslendingasögur (Icelandic Sagas or Sagas of Icelanders) are a series of prose narratives about events that took place in Iceland in the 9th, 10th and early 11th centuries. They are mostly based on historical events, but they also contain elements of fiction. The sagas tell the stories of the early settlers of Iceland, their families, and their descendants. Íslendingasögur are considered to be some of the finest examples of medieval literature. The sagas were originally written down in the 13th and 14th centuries, but they are believed to have been passed down orally for many years before that.
* Runes are letters of several related alphabets historically used by various Germanic peoples, including the Norse. In Nordic folklore, runes hold significant cultural and mystical importance. They are often associated with the god Odin, who, according to myth, obtained the knowledge of runes through self-sacrifice. In modern Nordic culture, runes continue to hold symbolic and cultural significance. While the runic alphabet is no longer in common use for writing, it has become a popular element in art, jewelry, and tattoos, often serving as a connection to Norse heritage and a way to express cultural pride. 
* Þorrablót is an annual mid-winter festival that celebrates traditional Icelandic cuisine. The festival is named after the month of Þorri, which falls in January or February, and features dishes such as fermented shark, dried fish, and smoked lamb. The festival also includes music, dancing, and other cultural activities.

== Folk dances ==
Nordic folklore&#x27;s traditional dances, intricately linked to celebrations, rituals, and communal assemblies, exhibit specific movements, patterns, and music deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of the region. An exploration of these dances unveils insights into social dynamics, community cohesion, and the perpetuation of mythological themes across generations.

=== Norway ===

* One Norwegian folk dance, Halling, is characterized by its quick tempo (95–106 bpm) and features acrobatic moves. Typically performed by men during weddings or parties, Halling showcases athleticism through kicks, spins, and rhythmic footwork. The dance serves not only as a form of entertainment, but also as a display of skill and strength.

=== Sweden ===

* Polska: Often danced as a couple, characterized by smooth flowing movements. Fiddle or nyckelharpa instruments are often found accompanying this dance. The dance holds cultural significance as it is commonly associated with celebrations and social gatherings.

=== Faroe islands ===

* The Faroese Chain Dance is the national dance of the Faroe Islands, often accompanied by kvæði, the Faroese ballads. Dancers form a circle, holding hands, and move in a rhythmic and coordinated manner. These ballads may recount tales of legendary heroes, folklore figures, or historical events specific to the Faroe Islands. The combination of dance and music enhances the immersive experience, allowing participants to physically engage with the narratives.

== Folk Architecture ==

=== Norway ===

Stave churches in Norway represent a unique synthesis of Christian and Norse cultural influences, evident in their architectural and ornamental features. These wooden structures, characterized by intricate carvings, serve as tangible artifacts linking contemporary communities to historical narratives. Beyond mere historical relics, Stave churches function as active centers for cultural preservation, hosting various ceremonies and events. In the context of Norway&#x27;s evolving cultural landscape, these churches endure as emblematic symbols of enduring identity and heritage, encapsulating the nuanced interplay between religious, mythological, and societal dimensions.

== Folklore figures ==
A large number of different mythological creatures from Scandinavian folklore have become well known in other parts of the world, mainly through popular culture and fantasy genres. Some of these are:

===Trolls===
Troll (Norwegian and Swedish), trolde (Danish) is a designation for several types of human-like supernatural beings in Scandinavian folklore. They are mentioned in the Edda (1220) as a monster with many heads. Later, trolls became characters in fairy tales, legends and ballads. They play a main part in many of the fairy tales from Asbjørnsen and Moes collections of Norwegian tales (1844). Trolls may be compared to many supernatural beings in other cultures, for instance the Cyclopes of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In Swedish, such beings are often termed &#x27;jätte&#x27; (giant), a word related to the Norse &#x27;jotun&#x27;. The origins of the word troll is uncertain.

Trolls are described in many ways in Scandinavian folk literature, but they are often portrayed as stupid, and slow to act. In fairy tales and legends about trolls, the plot is often that a human with courage and presence of mind can outwit a troll. Sometimes saints&#x27; legends involve a holy man tricking an enormous troll to build a church. Trolls come in many different shapes and forms, and are generally not fair to behold, as they can have as many as nine heads. Trolls live throughout the land. They dwell in mountains, under bridges, and at the bottom of lakes. Trolls who live in the mountains may be rich and hoard mounds of gold and silver in their cliff dwellings. Dovregubben, a troll king, lives inside the Dovre Mountains with his court, as described in detail in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

===Elves===

Elves (in Swedish, Älva if female and Alv if male, Alv in Norwegian, and Elver in Danish) are in some parts mostly described as female (in contrast to the light and dark elves in the Edda), otherworldly, beautiful and seductive residents of forests, meadows and mires. They are skilled in magic and illusions. Sometimes they are described as small fairies, sometimes as full-sized women and sometimes as half transparent spirits, or a mix thereof. They are closely linked to the mist and it is often said in Sweden that, &quot;the Elves are dancing in the mist&quot;. The female form of Elves may have originated from the female deities called Dís (singular) and Díser (plural) found in pre-Christian Scandinavian religion. They were very powerful spirits closely linked to the seid magic. Even today the word &quot;dis&quot; is a synonym for mist or very light rain in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. Particularly in Denmark, the female elves have merged with the dangerous and seductive huldra, skogsfrun or &quot;keeper of the forest&quot;, often called hylde. In some parts of Sweden the elves also share features with the Skogsfrun, &quot;Huldra&quot;, or &quot;Hylda&quot;, and can seduce and bewitch careless men and suck the life out of them or make them go down in the mire and drown. But at the same time the Skogsrå exists as its own being, with other distinct features clearly separating it from the elves. In more modern tales, it isn&#x27;t uncommon for a rather ugly male Tomte, Troll, Vätte or a Dwarf to fall in love with a beautiful Elven female, as the beginning of a story of impossible or forbidden love.

===Huldra===
The &quot;Huldra&quot;, Hylda, Skogsrå or Skogfru (Forest wife/woman) is a dangerous seductress who lives in the forest. The Huldra is said to lure men with her charm. She has a long cow&#x27;s tail, or according to some traditions, that of a fox, which she ties under her skirt in order to hide it from men. If she can manage to get married in a church, her tail falls off and she becomes human.

=== Huldufolk ===
The Huldufólk are a race of fairies or elves who are said to live in the mountains, hills, and rocks of the Faroes. They are said to be similar in appearance to humans, but they are much smaller and have pale skin and long, dark hair. The huldufólk are generally benevolent creatures, but they can be mischievous if they are angered.

===Mara===
In Scandinavia, there has been a widespread belief in the Mara. The Mara (or, in English, &quot;nightmare&quot;) appears in many different forms, but would terrorize the sleeping by &quot;riding&quot; on their chest, thus giving them nightmares. (This appears to describe &quot;apparitions&quot; commonly seen and/or felt during episodes of sleep paralysis.) The Mara traditionally could ride on cattle, which would be left drained of energy and with tangled fur at the Mara&#x27;s touch. Trees would curl up and wilt at the Mara&#x27;s touch as well. In some tales, like the Banshee, they served as an omen of death. If one were to leave a dirty doll in a family living room, one of the members would soon fall ill and die of tuberculosis. (&quot;Lung soot&quot;, another name for tuberculosis, referred to the effect of proper chimneys in 18th through 19th century homes. Inhabitants would therefore contract diseases due to inhaling smoke on a daily basis.)

There was some discrepancy as to how they came into being. Some stories say that the Maras are restless children, whose souls leave their body at night to haunt the living. Another tale explains that if a pregnant woman pulled a horse placenta over her head before giving birth, the child would be delivered safely; however, if it were a son, he would become a werewolf, and if a daughter, a Mara. 

===Nøkken===

&quot;Nøkken&quot;, &quot;näcken&quot;, or &quot;strömkarlen&quot;, is a dangerous fresh water-dwelling creature. The nøkk plays a fiddle to lure his victims out onto thin ice on foot or onto water in leaky boats, then draws them down to the bottom of the water where he is waiting for them. The nøkk is also a shapeshifter, who usually changes into a horse or a man in order to lure victims to him.

=== Storsjöodjuret ===
Storsjöodjuret, often referred to as the &quot;Great Lake Monster,&quot; is steeped in the folklore of Sweden, specifically with Lake Storsjön. Notably the legendary creature was briefly granted a protected status by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, but this was later removed by the Swedish Parliament.

=== Selma ===
Selma is a legendary sea serpent said to live in the Lake Seljord (&quot;Seljordsvatnet&quot;) in Seljord, Vestfold og Telemark, Norway.

=== Circhos ===
The &quot;circhos&quot; is a sea creature that looks like a man with three toes on each foot. Its skin is black and red. It has a long left foot and a small right foot which drags behind, making it lean left when walking.

=== Kraken ===
The Kraken is a legendary sea-monster, resembling a giant octopus or squid said to appear off the coasts of Norway.

=== Selkie ===
The Selkie is a mythical creature that is part-human and part-seal. According to legend, Selkies can shed their seal skins and transform into humans. There are many stories in Faroese folklore about Selkies falling in love with humans and leaving their sea life behind to live on land.

=== Dreygur ===
The dreygur is a legendary creature from Faroese folklore. It is said to be a type of undead being that inhabits the mountains and hills of the Faroe Islands. The dreygur is typically described as a large, strong creature with pale skin and long, dark hair. It is often depicted as being cannibalistic.

===Wights===

The &quot;Nisse&quot; (in southern Sweden, Norway and Denmark) or &quot;tomte&quot; (in Sweden) is a benevolent wight who takes care of the house and barn when the farmer is asleep, but only if the farmer reciprocates by setting out food for the nisse and he himself also takes care of his family, farm and animals. If the nisse is ignored or maltreated or the farm is not cared for, he is likely to sabotage the work instead to teach the farmer a lesson. Although the nisse should be treated with respect, some tales warn against treating him too kindly. There&#x27;s a Swedish story in which a farmer and his wife entered their barn early in the morning and found a little, old, grey man sweeping the floor. They saw his clothing, which was nothing more than torn rags, and the wife decided to make him some new ones; when the nisse found them in the barn, however, he considered himself too elegant to perform any more farm labour and thus disappeared from the farm. Nisser are also associated with Christmas and the yule time. Farmers customarily place bowls of rice porridge on their doorsteps to please the nisser, comparative to the cookies and milk left out for Santa Claus in other cultures. Some believe that the nisse brings them presents as well.

In Swedish, the word &quot;tomten&quot; (definite form of &quot;tomte&quot;) is very closely linked to the word for the plot of land where a house or cottage is built, which is called &quot;tomten&quot; as well (definite form of &quot;tomt&quot;). Therefore, some scholars believe that the wight Tomten originates from some sort of general house god or deity prior to Old Norse religion. A Nisse/Tomte is said to be able to change his size between that of a 5-year-old child and a thumb, and also to have the ability to make himself invisible.

A type of wight from Northern Sweden called &quot;Vittra&quot; lives underground, is invisible most of the time and has its own cattle. Most of the time Vittra are rather distant and do not meddle in human affairs, but are fearsome when enraged. This can be achieved by not respecting them properly, for example by neglecting to perform certain rituals (such as saying &quot;look out&quot; when putting out hot water or going to the toilet so they can move out of the way) or building your home too close to or, even worse, on top of their home, disturbing their cattle or blocking their roads. They can make your life very very miserable or even dangerous – they do whatever it takes to drive you away, even arrange accidents that will harm or even kill you. Even in modern days, people have rebuilt or moved houses in order not to block a &quot;Vittra-way&quot;, or moved from houses that are deemed a &quot;Vittra-place&quot; (Vittra ställe) because of bad luck – although this is rather uncommon. In tales told in the north of Sweden, Vittra often take the place that trolls, tomte and vättar hold in the same stories told in other parts of the country. Vittra are believed to sometimes &quot;borrow&quot; cattle that later would be returned to the owner with the ability to give more milk as a sign of gratitude. This tradition is heavily influenced by the fact that it was developed during a time when people let their cattle graze on mountains or in the forest for long periods of the year.

<doc id="471938" wikidata="Q5163273" url="?curid=471938" title="Consolidated Fund">
<text>In many states with political systems derived from the Westminster system, a consolidated fund or consolidated revenue fund is the main bank account of the government. General taxation is taxation paid into the consolidated fund (as opposed to hypothecated taxes earmarked for specific purposes), and general spending is paid out of the consolidated fund.

==The British Consolidated Fund==

===Establishment===
The British Consolidated Fund was so named as it consolidated together a number of existing accounts, detailed below, and facilitated proper parliamentary oversight of the spending of the executive; it was defined as &quot;one fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue and from which shall come the supply of every service&quot;.

The Treasury established this account, formerly known as The Account of His Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer, at the Bank of England where it remains to this day, and the legal term &quot;Consolidated Fund&quot; refers to the amount of credit held in this particular account. Under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 most of the revenue from taxation, and all other money payable to the Exchequer, must be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

===Earlier funds===
The General Fund was established in 1617, the Aggregate Fund in 1715, the South Sea Fund in 1717. These funds were established in relation to specific government borrowing authorized by Parliament, which had a defined type of revenue appropriated to put towards the interest and repayment. That particular revenue would be paid into the fund related to the loan. For example, the South Sea Fund was related to the debts of the South Sea Company. The Aggregate Fund was paid all the hereditary revenues of the English (and later British) Crown, such as profits from the Crown Estate and the Royal Mail. The hereditary revenues of Scotland were paid into the Consolidated Fund from 1788 onwards.

From 1716 onwards the surplus of the first three funds, after the interest and principal payments, flowed into a fourth fund, the sinking fund. This was intended to be applied to the repayment of the national debt but was instead mainly used for day-to-day necessities. It was eventually placed into the hands of the National Debt Commissioners, and was abandoned in the 1820s.

In 1752, before the Consolidated Fund was formed, the debts owed to the three existing funds had themselves been consolidated, and became irredeemable (the principal would only be repaid if the government chose to do so). They, therefore, became annuities, paying an annual rate of interest of 3%, and known as consolidated annuities, or consols.

===Ireland&#x27;s consolidated fund===

The Consolidated Fund Services of Great Britain and Ireland were merged by the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 into the single Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom that exists to this day.

The government of Ireland established separate funds for its own purposes when it gained autonomy in 1922 and then independence in 1937. The modern equivalent to the Consolidated Fund is the Central Fund.

===Payments into the fund===
All tax revenue is paid into the fund unless Parliament has specifically provided otherwise by law.

Any money received by the government which is not taxation, and is not to be retained by the receiving department (for example, fines), is classed as a Consolidated Fund extra receipt (CFER). These are to be paid into the Consolidated Fund as soon as they are received.

Balancing payments are made from the National Loans Fund (NLF), to ensure negative balances (caused by a spending in excess of taxation) are not carried over to the following day. 

===Payments out of the fund===

====Appropriation Acts and Consolidated Fund Acts====
Parliament gives statutory authority for the government to draw funds from the Consolidated Fund by Acts of Parliament known as Appropriation Acts and Consolidated Fund Acts. Funds are made available under the acts only for a specified financial year, a concept known as &quot;annuality&quot;, although an individual act can cover more than one financial year, listing separate amounts for each. Often a two-year period is covered by a Consolidated Fund Act, and roughly two or three are passed in each parliamentary year.

A Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill is brought in and passed at the end of the parliamentary year before the Summer recess. When passed, this is known as the Appropriation Act, and allocates the monies from the Consolidated Fund to the purposes set out in the main annual departmental expenditure estimates (the annual government department budgets, known as Estimates).

In the interim period between the start of the financial year and the passing of the Appropriation Act, a process known as votes on account is used to grant to departments up to 45% of the amounts they were allocated in the preceding financial year. These votes on account, and any necessary changes to departmental budgets (supplementary estimates) are passed as Consolidated Fund Acts, normally twice each year in November and February. Additional funds may be requested at any time, and will either require an additional Consolidated Fund Act, or will be included within other legislation.

The preamble of these supply acts is different from that of most other acts of Parliament. It currently reads:

Whereas the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled have resolved to authorise the use of resources and the issue of sums out of the Consolidated Fund towards making good the supply which they have granted to Her Majesty in this Session of Parliament:—

Until a few years ago, an older form of wording was used:

This follows the constitutional principle that the Crown (government) demands money, the House of Commons grants it, and the House of Lords assents to the grant. Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 only once, in 1784, has the Commons refused to grant access to funds.

If money paid from the Consolidated Fund is not spent by the end of the financial year, it must be repaid to the fund. Grant-in-aid payments are however excluded from this rule.

====Standing services====
Certain expenditure is by law charged directly to the Consolidated Fund and is not subject to Parliament&#x27;s annual budget process, ensuring a degree of independence of the government. Services funded in this way are known as Consolidated Fund Services and include judges&#x27; salaries, the Civil List payments, the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the expenses paid to returning officers at elections. In the case of the judges, this is to ensure the judicial independence introduced by the Act of Settlement 1701.

===Other modern funds===

* The National Loans Fund is the government&#x27;s main borrowing and lending account. It is closely linked to the Consolidated Fund, which maintains a daily balance of zero by means of a transfer to or from the National Loans Fund.
* The Exchange Equalisation Account is the government fund holding the UK&#x27;s reserves of foreign currencies, gold, and special drawing rights. It can be used to manage the value of the pound sterling on international markets.
* The National Insurance Fund is an account which holds the contributions of the National Insurance Scheme.
* The Contingencies Fund is an account which may be used for urgent expenditure in anticipation that the money will be approved by Parliament, or for small payments that were not included in the year&#x27;s budget estimates.

===Control of the fund===

====Comptroller====
The comptroller (who is also auditor general and head of the National Audit Office) controls both the Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund. The full official title of the role is &quot;Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of His Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer&quot;.

The Comptroller must authorise each requisition request received by the Bank of England from His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury, to assure that the request is compliant with the amounts and purposes authorised by Parliament in statute. If funds are mistakenly paid into the Consolidated Fund then both the Comptroller and the Treasury must agree to its return.

====Principal accountants====
Payments can only be made from the Consolidated Fund to one of the principal accountants defined by law. These are His Majesty&#x27;s Paymaster General, the Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs, the National Debt Commissioners, and the Chief Cashier at the Bank of England.

===Devolved government===
Each of the devolved government consolidated funds is held in the name of the Paymaster General at the Bank of England.

====Scotland====
The Westminster Parliament provides a sum of money annually to provide a budget for the Scottish Government and fund the operation of the Scottish Parliament and the salaries for judges of Scottish courts. This money is transferred from the UK Consolidated Fund into an account known as the Scottish Consolidated Fund.

If the income tax varying powers of the Scottish Parliament were to be used (the rate can be changed by plus or minus three percent), the additional revenue raised would be paid by the HM Revenue and Customs directly to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. If the tax is reduced, then the amount paid from the UK Consolidated Fund in that year would be correspondingly reduced.

====Wales====
There is also a Welsh Consolidated Fund to provide a budget for the Welsh National Assembly.

In addition to the budget provided to the Welsh Government, the expenditures of the Welsh National Assembly, the Auditor General for Wales, and the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales are also paid directly from the Welsh Consolidated Fund.

Payments are normally made from the fund following the passing in the Assembly of a budget motion or supplementary budget motion, proposed by the Welsh ministers. There are limited exceptions for emergency situations, or a failure of the Assembly to pass a budget; in addition some payments are automatically authorised by law, such as the salaries of National Assembly officials.

The Auditor General has to authorise all payments out of the Welsh Consolidated Fund to the Welsh ministers, having checked that the expenditure has been approved by the National Assembly.

====Northern Ireland====
The Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund has existed since 1921.

==Australia==
The use of consolidated funds in Australian government dates back to colonial times. Today the Australian federal and state governments all maintain their own consolidated funds, with authorization for payments required from the relevant parliament.

===Commonwealth (Federal) Government===
The Australian Government&#x27;s Consolidated fund is known as the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). The CRF is established through sections 81 to 83 of the Constitution of Australia. The constitution gives no guidance as to how the revenues or monies that form the CRF are to be kept or accounted for as the CRF is said to be &quot;self‑executing&quot; – that is, all money paid to the Commonwealth automatically forms part of the CRF, whether or not it has been credited to a fund or a bank account. Instead, accounting and banking practices pertaining to government funds are established in the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The Act requires that the Commonwealth maintains a central bank account with the Reserve Bank of Australia known as the Official Public Account (OPA). The act also allows for non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCEs) to account for and retain their receipts provided they have legislative and policy authority from the Prime Minister or Cabinet. However, most money collected by NCEs is treated as general government revenue that is not retainable and must be remitted to the OPA.

====Payments into the Consolidated Revenue Fund====

Section 81 of the Constitution of Australia provides that:

&quot;Revenues or moneys raised or received&quot; includes for instance taxes, fines, charges, levies, borrowings, loan repayments and money held in trust.

====Payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund====

Section 83 of the Australian Constitution provides that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made by law. The &quot;Treasury of the Commonwealth&quot; in Section 83 is held to be the same thing as the &quot;Consolidated Revenue Fund&quot; referred to in section 81, so taken together these two sections mean that there must be an appropriation for the purposes of the Commonwealth made by law before money may be drawn from the CRF.

Section 83 was intended to both safeguard parliament’s control over government spending, and restrict that expenditure to purposes authorised by the constitution. Over the years the meaning of &quot;for the purposes of the Commonwealth&quot; has been broadened considerably. It has been the subject of several High Court battles, and remains in contention.

===New South Wales===
Sections 39 and 40 of the Constitution of New South Wales require that all revenues, loans and other monies collected by the state are to be paid into a single consolidated fund. This was originally formed as the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1855, and was merged with the state&#x27;s General Loan Account to be named the Consolidated Fund from 1982.

==India==
The Indian government and each Indian state government maintain their own consolidated funds.

Article 266(1) of the Constitution of India requires revenues received (direct and indirect taxes, money borrowed) by the Government of India and expenses (receipts from loans given by the government), excluding the exceptional items, are part of consolidated fund.

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India audits these funds and reports to the relevant legislatures on their management.

The budget consists of two types of expenditure – the expenditure ‘charged’ upon the Consolidated Fund of India and the expenditure ‘made’ from the Consolidated Fund of India.

The charged expenditure is non-votable by the Parliament, that is, it can only be discussed by the Parliament, while the other type has to be voted by the Parliament.

The list of the charged expenditure is:

# Emoluments and allowances of the President and other expenditure relating to his office.
# Salaries and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
# Salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges of the Supreme Court.
# Pensions of the judges of high courts.
# Salary, allowances and pension of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
# Salaries, allowances and pension of the chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission.
# Administrative expenses of the Supreme Court, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the Union Public Service Commission including the salaries, allowances and pensions of the persons serving in these offices.
# The debt charges for which the Government of India is liable, including interest, sinking fund charges and redemption charges and other expenditure relating to the raising of loans and the service and redemption of debt.
# Any sum required to satisfy any judgment, decree or award of any court or arbitral tribunal.
# Any other expenditure declared by the Parliament to be so charged.

<text>The Cabinet of Fiji is a Government body of Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister of Fiji and responsible to the Parliament of Fiji. The Cabinet&#x27;s constitutional basis is sections 90 to 96 of the 2013 Constitution of Fiji.

Cabinet consists of the Prime Minister as chair and a number of Ministers. With the exception of the Attorney-General, they must be members of Parliament. Ministers hold office at the pleasure of the Prime Minister, or until they resign or cease to be MPs.

The cabinet is responsible to Parliament. Ministers must provide regular reports to Parliament on their areas of responsibility and must appear before Parliament or any committee on a request to answer questions about their areas of responsibility.

Prior to the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état and the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis, Fiji&#x27;s Cabinet was governed by the 1997 Constitution. An unusual feature of the constitution was to require a compulsory coalition cabinet, with every political party with more than 8 seats in the 71-member parliament required to be offered a proportionate number of cabinet posts. The model was not successfully implemented for nearly a decade, with the governments of both Mahendra Chaudhry and Laisenia Qarase refusing to offer Cabinet seats to their political opponents. It was only after the 2006 election that a full multi-party Cabinet was appointed. The multi-party model was not continued in the 2013 constitution.

<doc id="471952" wikidata="Q177166" url="?curid=471952" title="King cake">
<text>A king cake, also known as a three kings cake or a baby cake, is a cake associated in many countries with Epiphany, the celebration of the Twelfth Night after Christmas. Its form and ingredients are variable, but in most cases a () such as a figurine representing the Christ Child, is hidden inside. After the cake is cut, whoever finds the fève in their slice wins a prize. Modern fèves can be made of other materials, but always represent the King or Baby Jesus.

==History==


The origin of the cake tradition was popularly believed to be related to the Roman Saturnalia. These were festivals dedicated to the god Saturn so that the Roman people, in general could celebrate the longer days that began to come after the winter solstice. For this reason, Margaret Hasluck disputed as well the Greek tradition commemorating St. Basil&#x27;s feast day with &quot;vasilopita&quot;, saying both customs had a common origin in the Saturnalia and &quot;Kronia&quot;.

In the Middle Ages, it was said that the king who was chosen had to pay the assembly a general round of drinks. To prevent cheating, the edible bean was replaced by a porcelain bean. In Christian tradition the cake commemorates the witness of the &quot;Three Kings&quot;.

The tradition of the Mardi Gras king cake did not become established until the 20th-century, although the ubiquitous
gold, purple and green sprinkles have been standard decoration since 1872. The cake is usually purchased at a shop. Many holiday foods have rituals and customs connected to the preparation of the food, but the customs of the kings cake mainly revolve around the fève. Sugar was always a big industry in New Orleans where local bakeries took an active role in turning the cake into a modern cultural icon. Old-fashioned versions of the cake are basically a round braided brioche without filling but these days bakeries try to outdo one another with creative fillings.

==Regional variants==
===French-speaking countries and regions===

There are two different versions of the French king cake: the &quot;galette&quot; and the &quot;gâteau&quot;. The is a flaky puff pastry traditionally filled with frangipane. These days the filling may also be fruit, chocolate or cream-based fillings. It has become a tradition for pastry chefs to create innovative versions of the &quot;galette&quot; featuring ingredients like flavored liquors, candied fruits and ganache.

The &quot;gâteau des rois&quot; associated mainly with the region of Provence in the south of France is a brioche dough decorated with candied fruit and coarse sugar.

The Guianan galette (more commonly known as the Creole galette) is a traditional pastry of French Guianan cuisine. This is a Creole variant of the galette des rois which is eaten as a dessert during Epiphany. It can be garnished with cream, coconut, guava, etc. It is consumed throughout the Carnival period (from the Epiphany until Lent, ending Ash Wednesday) and preferably accompanied by champagne.

A paper crown is included with purchased cakes to crown the &quot;king&quot; or &quot;queen&quot; who finds the &quot;&quot; or bean, or coin hidden inside the cake. To ensure a random distribution of the pieces, the youngest person is to place themselves under the table and name the recipient of each piece as they are cut. When store-bought, the can be a tiny porcelain figurine of a religious character or, nowadays, a figurine referencing pop-culture or popular cartoons.

===German-speaking countries===
The German and Swiss &quot;Dreikönigskuchen&quot; &#x27;three kings cake&#x27; are shaped like wreathes or rounds, and uses an almond as the fève.

===Portugal===
Bolo-rei () is a traditional Portuguese cake eaten from the beginning of December until Epiphany. The recipe is derived from the Southern French which found its way to Portugal during the 1800s when &quot;&quot; opened as the Portuguese monarchy&#x27;s official bakery in 1829.

The cake is round with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallized and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallized fruit. Also included is the dried fava bean, and tradition dictates that whoever finds the fava has to pay for the cake next year.

===Spanish-speaking countries===

The Roscón de Reyes is eaten in Spain, Latin America and the United States. Recipes vary from country to country and between cultures but tend to be similar. It generally has an oval shape due to the need to make cakes large enough for large groups. For decoration, figs, quinces, cherries, or dried and candied fruits are often, but not exclusively, used. The tradition of placing a bean, candy or figurine inside the cake that diners find in their slice is followed.

In Spain the cake consists of a sweet brioche dough aromatised with orange blossom water and decorated with slices of candied or crystallized fruit of various colors. It can be filled with whipped cream, cream, almond paste or others. The figurine traditionally represents one of the Three Wise Men Biblical Magi. A dry broad bean is also introduced inside the roscón. It is tradition that whoever finds the bean pays for the roscón.

In Mexico, Central and South America, the figurine represents the Child Jesus. The figurine of the baby Jesus hidden in the bread represents the flight of the Holy Family, fleeing from Herod the Great&#x27;s Massacre of the Innocents. Whoever finds the baby Jesus figurine is blessed and must take the figurine to the nearest church on Candlemas Day or host a party that day.

===United Kingdom===
The Twelfth cake, Twelfth-night cake, or Twelfth-tide cake was once popular in the United Kingdom on Twelfth Night. It was frequently baked with a bean hidden in one side and a pea hidden in the other; the man/lord finding the bean became King for the night, while the woman/lady finding the pea became the Queen – also known as the Lord or Lady of Misrule. Earlier, in the time of Shakespeare, there was only a Lord of Misrule, chosen by the hidden bean, reflected in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

Samuel Pepys recorded a party in London on Epiphany night 1659/1660, and described the role the cake played in the choosing of a &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot; for the occasion: &quot;...to my cousin Stradwick, where, after a good supper, there being there my father, mother, brothers, and sister, my cousin Scott and his wife, Mr. Drawwater and his wife, and her brother, Mr. Stradwick, we had a brave cake brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was Queen and Mr. Stradwick was King. After that my wife and I bid adieu and came home, it being still a great frost.&quot;

Although still occasionally found in the United Kingdom, as the Industrial Revolution curtailed the celebration of the 12 days of Christmas during the Victorian era, the cake declined in popularity to be replaced by the Christmas cake. 18th century actor Robert Baddeley&#x27;s will bequeathed £3 per annum to serve wine, punch and a Twelfth Night cake to the performers of the Drury Lane Theatre in the green room each Twelfth Night; the ceremony of the &quot;Baddeley Cake&quot; has remained a regular event, missed only 13 times in over 200 years, during wartimes or theatre closures.

===United States===

In Louisiana and parts of the Gulf Coast region historically settled by the French, king cake is associated with Mardi Gras and is traditionally served from Epiphany until Carnival and recently year-round. It may have been introduced by Basque settlers in 1718, or by the French in 1870.

It comes in a number of styles. The most simple, said to be the most traditional, is a ring of twisted cinnamon roll-style dough. It may be topped with icing or sugar, which may be colored to show the traditional Mardi Gras colors of purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power. Cakes may also be filled with cream cheese, praline, cinnamon, or an assortment of fruit fillings.

Traditionally, a small porcelain baby, symbolizing Jesus, is hidden in the king cake and is a way for residents of Louisiana to celebrate their Christian faith. The baby symbolizes luck and prosperity to whoever finds it. That person is also responsible for purchasing next week&#x27;s cake or hosting the next Mardi Gras party. Often, bakers place the baby outside of the cake, leaving the purchaser to hide it themselves. This is usually to avoid liability for any choking hazard.

In 2009, the New Orleans Pelicans basketball team introduced the King Cake Baby as a seasonal mascot. The New Orleans Baby Cakes (formerly the Zephyrs) were a AAA baseball team that played their final three seasons (2017–2019) with that name before relocating and becoming the Wichita Wind Surge.

<text>Viscount Long, of Wraxall in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The title was created in 1921 for the Conservative politician Walter Long, who had previously served as Member of Parliament, President of the Board of Agriculture, President of the Local Government Board, Secretary of State for the Colonies and First Lord of the Admiralty. His grandson, the second Viscount (son of Brigadier General Walter Long) was killed in action in the Second World War. He was succeeded by his uncle, the third Viscount, who had earlier represented Westbury in Parliament as a Conservative. The title was next held by his son, the fourth Viscount, who served as a government whip from 1979 to 1997 in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Lord Long lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fifth Viscount, who succeeded in that year.

Richard Chaloner, 1st Baron Gisborough, was the younger brother of the first Viscount. Child actress Charlotte Long was the daughter of the fourth Viscount.

<doc id="471966" wikidata="Q1898365" url="?curid=471966" title="TISM">
<text>TISM ( ; an acronym of This Is Serious Mum) are a seven-piece anonymous alternative rock band, formed in Melbourne, Australia on 30 December 1982 by vocalist/drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert, bassist/vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist/vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun, with vocalist Ron Hitler-Barassi joining the group the following year. These four members have formed the core of the band since their inception, with the line-up being rounded out by guitarists Leak Van Vlalen (1982–1991), Tokin&#x27; Blackman (1991–2004; died 2008) and Vladimir Lenin-McCartney (2022–present), as well as backing vocalists/dancers Les Miserables and Jon St. Peenis.

Noted for their dark humour, sarcastic delivery and melodic songwriting, the seven members of TISM appear in public as a pseudonymous, semi-paramilitary collective masked in a variety of balaclavas (usually as part of a more elaborate costume), and are known for their &quot;chaotic&quot; appearances in Australian media, often frustrating interviewers with absurd non sequiturs and tongue-in-cheek nihilism. Their catalogue is replete with references to popular culture, particularly literature, music and Australian rules football; their (usually derogatory) references to celebrities have sometimes incurred controversy and even censorship.

They developed a large underground following throughout the 1980s and 1990s, issuing a number of singles, albums, videos, a short-lived line of comics, and a book (&quot;The TISM Guide to Little Aesthetics&quot;). Backed by the successful singles &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; and &quot;Greg! The Stop Sign!!&quot;, their third album, &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot;, reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995, won Best Independent Release at that year&#x27;s ARIA Music Awards, and was certified Gold in January 1996. TISM split following their first live performance in December 1983; every live show since has been considered a &quot;reunion&quot; concert. The band split again in late 2004 following the release of their sixth album, &quot;The White Albun&quot;. Their last single, &quot;Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me&quot;, enjoyed viral popularity due in large part to its animated music video.

Following an almost 18-year hiatus, TISM reformed in June 2022, returning to the stage for a series of three &quot;secret&quot; shows in Melbourne throughout November, prior to their appearances on the line-up of Good Things festival in December. They released their seventh album, &quot;Death to Art&quot;, in October 2024, following a 20-year gap since the release of &quot;The White Albun&quot;.

==History==
=== 1982–1984: Early years, first break up and reunion ===
In December 1982, Humphrey B. Flaubert (Damian Cowell – drums and lead vocals) and Eugene de la Hot-Croix Bun (Eugene Cester – keyboards and backing vocals), previously members of a group called I Can Run, recorded a nine song demo tape titled &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; with guitarist Jock Cheese (Jack Holt – guitar, bass and backing vocals) under the name This Is Serious Mum. The line-up would soon expand to include Ron Hitler-Barassi (Peter Minack – vocals) and Leak Van Vlalen (Sean Kelly – guitar) by the following year.

This Is Serious Mum continued to record private home-made demos (with titles including &quot;Hooked on Crap&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Novel! It&#x27;s Unique! It&#x27;s Shithouse!&quot;) throughout 1983, producing over one hundred songs within twelve months. This period of activity culminated in the band&#x27;s first public appearance, at the Duncan McKinnon Athletics Reserve in the small suburb of Murrumbeena on 6 December 1983. The so-called &quot;Get Fucked Concert&quot; was considered an &quot;artistic and commercial failure&quot;, causing the band to split up; thus giving the show the dubious honour of simultaneously being the band&#x27;s debut &quot;and&quot; farewell, and making every subsequent performance a &quot;reunion&quot; show.

TISM returned to home-made recordings in February 1984. During this period they briefly experimented with dark ambient and industrial music, before returning to their former style. On 25 November 1984, the band performed their first &quot;reunion&quot; show at the University of Melbourne. At the show they released a self-titled demo tape which they recorded earlier that year at the home studio of Serious Young Insects drummer Mark White. Only eleven copies of the demo (which featured examples of their brief flirtation with industrial music) were made available at the show; all had sold by the time the band finished their short set.

=== 1985–1990: First releases, &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Hot Dogma&quot; ===
By 1985, TISM were playing regularly around Melbourne. They released their debut single, &quot;Defecate on My Face&quot;, in 1986; a 7&quot; vinyl record packaged in a 12&quot; sleeve with all four sides glued shut. The song is also found (in an unlisted &quot;country&quot; version) on the mini-album &quot;Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion&quot;. Their next single, &quot;40 Years – Then Death&quot;, was released in 1987 on transparent vinyl in a clear plastic sleeve with no cover art or labels. TISM&#x27;s first radio-friendly single, despite the obscure packaging, was received well.

TISM&#x27;s debut album &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; was released in 1988, as a double vinyl release in an embossed gatefold sleeve. The first record contained twelve of TISM&#x27;s most popular tracks, and the second was a collage of interviews, bedroom recordings and live &quot;diatribes&quot; from Ron Hitler-Barassi. &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; entered the lower reaches of Australia&#x27;s mainstream Top 50, as did the single &quot;Saturday Night Palsy&quot;, the following year. The group appeared on the long-running variety TV program &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; performing the single; during this appearance three additional seven-person line-ups joined the initial seven members of the band onstage, leading to a total of twenty-eight &quot;members&quot; of TISM miming the song by the end of the performance.

In 1989, TISM self-published a book compiling lyrics, interviews and press releases titled &quot;The TISM Guide to Little Aesthetics&quot;, however the book could not be released until early 1990 as TISM, having been threatened with legal action for libel, were required to censor the book, which they did by hand with a mixture of white-out and permanent marker (also placing stickers reading &quot;CENSORED DUE TO LEGAL ADVICE&quot; on the cover of each copy). Despite this, some uncensored copies exist, and a document with the censored content is available.

In 1990, TISM entered negotiations with CBS Records and Phonogram Records and were signed by the latter. In April that year, the band began work on what would become their next album with producer Laurence Maddy. When Phonogram released &quot;Hot Dogma&quot; in 1990, it failed to reach the commercial charts, and TISM were fired six months later due to management issues, despite owing the label tens of thousands of dollars. &quot;Hot Dogma&quot; is the first release to use the acronymic form of the band&#x27;s name exclusively.

Over two nights in May 1991, the band were filmed live and released the video &quot;Incontinent in Ten Continents&quot;. These performances were the last for guitarist Leak Van Vlalen.

=== 1991–1998: Rise to fame, &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot; and &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; ===

In mid-1991, TISM signed with independent record label Shock Records and re-issued &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot;, as well as the EP &quot;Gentlemen, Start Your Egos&quot;; a compilation of tracks previously unavailable on CD. TISM, with producer Tony Cohen, released the EP &quot;Beasts of Suburban&quot; in 1992. A new guitarist, Tony Coitus (later Tokin&#x27; Blackman) joined the group onstage for the first time on 23 January 1992. Les Miserables and Jon St. Peenis left following the Beasts of Suburban tour, replaced by two new dancers who inherited their stage names.

The 1993 EP, &quot;Australia the Lucky Cunt&quot; was the group&#x27;s most controversial release to date. Courts issued an injunction order of the CD when the Ken Done Society threatened legal action over the artwork, which parodied Done&#x27;s signature style and depicted a koala sucking a syringe. The matter was settled for an undisclosed amount of money &quot;fairly close to the amount that Radiohead spends on buying friends&quot;, and the EP was re-released with a new cover graphic and title: &quot;Censored Due to Legal Advice&quot;. During 1994, TISM sometimes played under the names &quot;The Frank Vitkovic Jazz Quartet&quot;, &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot; (which would later be used as an album title) and &quot;Late for Breakfast&quot;.

TISM&#x27;s third album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot;, was their biggest success; a shift from alternative rock to synth-driven techno and dance, which retained the band&#x27;s usual vocal melodies and loud guitars. Three of its singles reached Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100, two of them in the top 10 in 1995. The album was certified gold and won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release. Success exposed TISM to mainstream Australian radio and television, most of which was perplexed by the band&#x27;s guerrilla approach to interviews and lack of interest in the music industry.

On 27 April 1995, the band appeared on the RMITV show &quot;Under Melbourne Tonight&quot; and performed &quot;Protest Song&quot; and &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. In June, Humphrey B. Flaubert and Ron Hitler-Barassi appeared as guest programmers on the long-running late night music program &quot;Rage&quot;, where they aired clips by artists such as the Wiggles, the Bay City Rollers and Leif Garrett. A four CD box set, &quot;Collected Recordings 1986–1993&quot;, was released in December, and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand.

In 1996 TISM toured on the Big Day Out, during which Hitler-Barassi was either absent or requiring a wheelchair due to a detached retina and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour. Later the same year, TISM toured England, the group&#x27;s sole Northern Hemisphere excursion.

Taking a year off from touring, TISM spent 1997 working on their next album with producer Lachlan Magoo. The album, &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; was released in 1998. The first official music video for the album, &quot;I Might Be a Cunt, but I&#x27;m Not a Fucking Cunt&quot; was rarely broadcast. Returned and Services League of Australia head Bruce Ruxton wrote a letter of complaint to Shock Records describing it as &quot;... Dropping [Australia&#x27;s standards] through the floor into the proverbial sewer.&quot; The letter was published on TISM&#x27;s official website at the time, alongside the single&#x27;s press release.

&quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; sold well, thanks in part to an extensive Australian tour with Regurgitator, then at the height of their popularity, and the Fauves; however, sales were low compared to &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot;″s success and TISM&#x27;s contract with Shock ended by mutual agreement.

=== 1999–2002: Festival Records and &quot;De RigueurMortis&quot; ===
Following the 1998 tour, TISM signed with Festival Mushroom Records, which re-released their entire back catalogue (except for &quot;Hot Dogma&quot;, their previous singles and the bonus discs for &quot;Machiavelli&quot; and &quot;wanker.com&quot;) on CD.

Their first and only official album with Festival Mushroom Records was &quot;De RigueurMortis&quot;, released in 2001. It débuted at No. 24 on the ARIA chart and No. 3 on the Alternative ARIA Chart. Flaubert predicted on Triple J radio that the album would &quot;plummet out of the top 40 like a stone&quot;; – the following week, it was not on the list. Touring became less thorough than in previous years, though no less active – at the closing of the Punters Club, the band ended up naked and tore the ceiling down during the gig.

In early 2002, the track &quot;Honk If You Love Fred Durst&quot; was released as a single. In 2002, Festival Mushroom Records released &quot;tism.bestoff.&quot;, a best of compilation which included their greatest hits, two new tracks and a disc of remastered Bedroom Recordings. The compilation was their third, and last, release with Festival Mushroom Records, as TISM&#x27;s contract had ended. Finding themselves with no record label again, TISM returned to touring.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;The White Albun&quot; and last appearances ===
On 6 January 2003, bassist Jock Cheese released a solo album, &quot;Platter&quot;, on Shock Records. The album was co-written by Cheese with Ron Hitler-Barassi and Humphrey B. Flaubert, and contained the full version of &quot;Unfair&quot;, a track previously excerpted as the introduction to &quot;De RigeurMortis&quot;. Guitarist Tokin&#x27; Blackman contributes classical guitar to one track; otherwise most of the album&#x27;s instruments were recorded by Cheese.

On September 26, TISM held a special one-off concert at the Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne, presented as the &quot;Save Our TISM&quot; telethon, in which they solicited donations from the public to keep them from breaking up; despite apparently receiving the desired amount, the band &quot;split&quot; at the end of the show. The performance was filmed and released as part of the three-disc CD/DVD package &quot;The White Albun&quot; in 2004 by Madman Entertainment. Despite the &quot;split&quot;, TISM continued to perform in order to promote the release of &quot;The White Albun&quot;, which also included the group&#x27;s sixth (and to date, final) studio album, and an additional DVD containing a short documentary, the band&#x27;s music videos, and a collection of home videos. The three disc set received good reviews; however, it was not eligible for ARIA chart tracking.

At the band&#x27;s penultimate concert on 13 November 2004, Hitler-Barassi delivered a diatribe saying that the band had &quot;lost the election&quot; and made references to Guy Sebastian winning that year&#x27;s season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. This show was followed by the band&#x27;s last live performance for almost two decades, at the Earthcore festival later in the month. Following this show, TISM - quietly and without fanfare - disbanded.

In 2005, TISM released the single &quot;Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me&quot; in the German market. Sony/BMG Germany expressed interest in the song when its animated clip by Bernard Derriman became a viral hit, thanks to bloggers and sites such as YouTube. The single reached the German commercial charts.

In October 2006, TISM were inducted into the EG Hall of Fame, at which they made an appearance and &quot;a hilariously irreverent speech&quot;. When asked about the current status of TISM at the time, Humphrey B. Flaubert remarked &quot;we are slowly moving towards our deaths&quot;.

===2006–2019: Post-TISM activity===
In early 2005, Damian Cowell (the former Humphrey B. Flaubert) formed a country and western band called Root!, producing a series of demos under the name &quot;DC Root&quot;. The project continued until 2010, producing two albums and an EP. Cowell followed Root! with The DC3, featuring Root! guitarist Henri Grawe. The project, which released its first single &quot;I Was the Guy in TISM&quot; in 2010, continued until 2013, producing two albums. Following The DC3, Cowell formed Damian Cowell&#x27;s Disco Machine, which to date has produced three albums.

On 9 April 2008, James &quot;Jock&quot; Paull (best known as TISM&#x27;s long-time guitarist Tokin&#x27; Blackman) died of lung cancer. In October 2009, the majority of TISM&#x27;s back catalogue was re-released on iTunes with bonus material. In March 2010, a &quot;21st century mix&quot; of their single &quot;Shut Up – The Footy&#x27;s on the Radio&quot; was released on iTunes. The 21st century mix features Humphrey B. Flaubert on vocals and Jock Cheese on guitars, and had wholly new lyrics. In April 2012, former guitarist Sean Kelly (aka Leak Van Vlalen) performed a series of songs live with satirist/musician Kieran Butler as &quot;RealiTISM&quot;. Kelly has continued to play TISM material live in years since.

In 2015, appetite for a TISM reunion began to build after Australia was formally invited to join that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest. According to two competing Change.org petitions, TISM was 37 times more popular a choice for Australia&#x27;s Eurovision representative than Kylie Minogue, with the petition for TISM receiving over 14,000 signatures in support. Flaubert refused to comment at the time, however suggested that &quot;if a giant multinational with [a] horrendous human rights record was to give me a huge cheque I&#x27;ll dob in my grandmother&quot;. Australia&#x27;s representative for the 2015 Eurovision song contest was ultimately Guy Sebastian with the song &quot;Tonight Again&quot;, which came in fifth place.

Australia has continued to participate in Eurovision in the years since, with TISM occasionally being suggested as Australia&#x27;s representative - including in 2018 by the future 31st Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese. Albanese, a known TISM fan, also featured &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in a DJ set at the Corner Hotel in Richmond in June 2016. In September 2017, Albanese described TISM as having &quot;a bit of dark humour, I think it&#x27;s fair to say... but they were just great fun.&quot;

In response to the growing demand for a TISM reunion, in April 2015 Damian Cowell said &quot;if TISM came back, it would be shithouse. That&#x27;s the answer... to that question. I think that&#x27;s sort of the point that eludes most bands that make a comeback. They don&#x27;t ask that question, &#x27;will it be shithouse or not?&#x27; And because they don&#x27;t ask that question, they go out and it&#x27;s shithouse.&quot;

=== 2020–2021: Reissue campaign ===
On 22 January 2020, TISM released their back catalogue on Spotify. In February, a proposal from Melbourne politician David Limbrick to rename the Mordialloc Freeway the &quot;TISM Mordialloc Freeway&quot; was rejected by the Victorian government. On 10 April, &quot;Live at the Corner Hotel 30 May 1988&quot;, a recording of a concert at that venue which had previously circulated as a bootleg, was released digitally by the Australian Road Crew Initiative as a benefit for music employees put out of work by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 14 October 2020, a press release credited (for the first time in 12 years) to Ron Hitler-Barassi was published at www.tism.net.au. It concluded by saying that TISM would begin a CD and vinyl reissue campaign with former head of Shock Records, David Williams. The reissue campaign began 21 December with the release of a recording of TISM&#x27;s last live performance at the 2004 Earthcore festival, titled &quot;On Behalf of TISM I Would Like To Concede We Have Lost the Election&quot;, and a transparent vinyl disc containing almost two hours of silence (pressed at Abbey Road Studios), titled &quot;The TISM Omni-Album&quot;. These were TISM&#x27;s first vinyl releases in 30 years, and first physical releases since their final studio album, &quot;The White Albun&quot;, in 2004.

On 17 November 2020, a vinyl single featuring a cover of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;For Those About to Rock&quot; was released in a variety of editions, featuring cover art designed by four of the band&#x27;s members. The song had been recorded in the 1990s for an AC/DC tribute album but was never released, although excerpts had circulated in the TISM fan community for many years. The single&#x27;s B-side was &quot;Let&#x27;s Hang Around the Shopping Centre&quot;, another unreleased song dating to the post-&quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; era. The release of the single was also accompanied by the first release of official TISM T-shirts (featuring two of the aforementioned cover designs) in 16 years.

TISM&#x27;s reissue campaign continued in 2021 with the June release of the Record Store Day exclusive limited edition 7&quot; single &quot;Mistah Eliot – He Wanker&quot;, featuring an unreleased version of &quot;Kill Yourself Now and Avoid the Rush&quot; on the B-side, and in July, the first wide release of their 1984 self-titled demo &quot;This Is Serious Mum&quot; on vinyl and CD, and &quot;Punt Road&quot;, a 1987 rehearsal session, also on vinyl and CD. In September a compilation of the group&#x27;s remixes, &quot;Collected Remixes&quot;, was issued on vinyl only. In November, the mini-album &quot;Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion&quot; was reissued on vinyl and, for the first time, on CD.

=== 2022–present: Reunion and &quot;Death to Art&quot; ===

On 15 June 2022, TISM were announced as one of the headlining acts on the 2022 edition of Good Things, and were said to be playing their first performances since 2004 exclusively as part of the festival. Shortly following this announcement, TISM founders Humphrey B. Flaubert and Ron Hitler-Barassi made their first media appearances in sixteen years, providing interviews to Music Feeds and Guardian Australia, as well as Double J and ABC Radio in Sydney and Melbourne, and almost immediately prompting a (tongue-in-cheek) feud with Regurgitator, who were also appearing at Good Things.

A box set edition of their first single &quot;Defecate on My Face&quot; (containing the 7&quot; single along with an additional 12&quot; record and CD) was released in August 2022, alongside a compilation of the band&#x27;s A-sides, &quot;Collected Versus: The Complete TISM Singles&quot;, on CD and vinyl. The CD edition of &quot;Collected Versus&quot; contains the remix compilation &quot;Collected Remixes&quot; on the second disc, and features liner notes from former &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; editor and known TISM fan Tyler Jenke, while the LP version features liner notes by Williams. An alternate edition of &quot;Collected Versus&quot; was released for the American market in early November, with a different second disc, titled &quot;Kill Americans: A TISM Primer&quot;, featuring a selection of album tracks.

On 17 October, former guitarist Sean Kelly (Leak Van Vlalen) confirmed he was not rejoining TISM, as the band required a guitarist who could comfortably cover both Kelly&#x27;s parts and those of the late James &quot;Jock&quot; Paull (or Tokin&#x27; Blackman). Shortly afterwards, it was announced (via the launch of an official Instagram page) that TISM&#x27;s new guitarist was named Vladimir Lenin-McCartney. Lenin-McCartney&#x27;s stage name is a riff on Russian politician Vladimir Lenin and the songwriting duo Lennon–McCartney.

Three weeks ahead of Good Things, on 12 November 2022, the reunited TISM held their first concert in 18 years, an hour-long secret show (billed as &quot;Open Mic Tryouts&quot;) at the Croxton Bandroom in Thornbury. A second secret show (billed as &quot;Banjo Paterson-Lakes&quot;) followed the weekend after, at the Prince Bandroom in St. Kilda, on 19 November. Later that night, Flaubert and Hitler-Barassi made their second appearance on the music program &quot;Rage&quot;, again providing an eclectic and eccentric series of programming choices, such as a 1970s &quot;Four Corners&quot; report on the middle class, and tracks by Crazy Frog, Mark &quot;Jacko&quot; Jackson and Jim Steinman.

On 25 November 2022, &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; was reissued on CD and limited edition blue-coloured vinyl, preceding an expanded seven-disc vinyl box set edition entitled &quot;Wanker Box&quot;, which was eventually released in May 2023. A two-disc limited coloured vinyl edition of the live album &quot;Machines Against the Rage&quot; was also released on 25 November. The following day, TISM performed their third secret warm-up show at 170 Russell in Melbourne, billed as &quot;Rex Oedipus and Jack &#x27;Elephant&#x27; Titus&quot;.

TISM played all three dates of Good Things from 2–4 December 2022 in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. During these three shows, the band were outfitted in silver costumes with large helium balloons attached; a group of tradesmen also appeared onstage during the set and erected a set of foam letters reading &quot;TISN&quot;. The balloons worn by the band were later sold on their website.

On 19 May 2023, the band released a seven-disc box set of their fourth album, &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; celebrating its 25th anniversary.

On 18 August 2023, the band released &quot;Hot Dogma Sing Sing Sessions&quot;, a demo tape recorded for their album &quot;Hot Dogma&quot; containing previously unreleased songs and six recordings that previously appeared on &quot;Collected Recordings 1986–1993&quot;.

On 10 November 2023, their EP &quot;The Beasts of Suburban&quot; was reissued as a 3CD/4LP box set, containing over 50 unreleased demo recordings made by the band between 1991 and 1992, as well as the four iTunes bonus tracks for the first time on a physical release.

16 November 2023 saw the band announcing a performance at the Museum of Old and New Art, for which Cowell had previously composed an album over a decade prior, to take place on 2 March 2024.

On 30 November 2023, the band released the single &quot;I&#x27;ve Gone Hillsong&quot; on music streaming services, a satire from the perspective of the Hillsong Church. It marked their first new song in 19 years, and the first with Lenin-McCartney on guitar. The B-side of the single contained a new diatribe performed by Hitler-Barassi, &quot;Schopenhauer&#x27;s SUV&quot;. The band also teased three new shows on Australia&#x27;s east coast for early 2024 to accompany the Museum of Old and New Art concert. On 8 December 2023, the band announced their new EP &quot;The &quot;C&quot; Word&quot; and was released the following week on 15 December 2023. It was the band&#x27;s first EP in 30 years, since the release of &quot;Australia the Lucky Cunt&quot; in 1993. &quot;The &#x27;C&#x27; Word&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Gone Hillsong&quot; hit No. 1 and No. 3 on the Australian Independent Record Labels Association&#x27;s single charts.

TISM performed a secret show at the Pier Bandroom in Frankston on 24 February 2024, under the name &quot;Dua Liposuction&quot;, with The Bennies supporting. At that show, three new songs were debuted: &quot;Old Skool TISM&quot; (whose lyrics were originally recited as a diatribe at the end of the 2022 secret shows), &quot;Somebody to Hate&quot; and &quot;Destroy All Art&quot; (which would later be retitled to &quot;Death to Art&quot;), as well as a new version of &quot;40 Years - Then Death&quot;, entitled &quot;14 Years - Then Death&quot;. The band would go on to perform the same setlist at MONA FOMA in Launceston the following week, which opened with a parody TED talk skit, which continued behind the band for the duration of the show. This was also Lenin-McCartney&#x27;s last show with the band - he left around this time, and his guitar would later be sold on eBay.

On 16 April 2024, the band released &quot;No Penis, No God&quot;, a gospel album they had recorded in January 1996, which had remained for the most part unreleased (nine tracks had been previously issued as iTunes bonus tracks on &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; in 2009), as a limited-edition bootleg-style LP.

11 July saw the band debuting &quot;Death to Art&quot; on Double J. The song was released as a single two days later, with another diatribe, &quot;Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 915 (The Ballad of Jen and Steve)&quot;, as the B-side.

On 7 August, the band released the music video to &quot;Death to Art&quot;, which was crowdsourced by fans, also announcing that it is the title track of their upcoming album, the first in 20 years and the first with McCartney on guitar, and a headline tour of Australia in October and November that month, to be supported by The Mavis&#x27;s, Machine Gun Fellatio, Ben Lee and Eskimo Joe. The 26th of that month saw Jenke announce a &quot;33 1/3&quot; book about &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot;, with a 1 May 2025 release date.

On 6 September, the band released &quot;&#x27;70s Football&quot;, the fourth single from the album, as a music video on YouTube. On 18 September, a warmup show was announced at The Gov in Adelaide for 6 October, which sold out within two days. At that show, TISM performed with a new left-handed guitarist, who inherited his stage name from his predecessor, and a brass section.

On 16 October, a music video was released for &quot;Old Skool TISM&quot;, composed of archival live footage of the band, from 1988&#x27;s &quot;Shoddy and Poor&quot; VHS up to Good Things Festival. 

On 24 November, the band appeared on &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, performing a mashup of the Gorillaz&#x27; &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; with parts of &quot;Tradies Get the Ladies&quot;, a diatribe the band had recited at Good Things.

The &quot;Death to Art&quot; tour ended on 29 November at the Hordern Pavilion. At the end of the show, TISM took a bow then posed for a photo with the other bands and the artists from the stage show.

==Members==
TISM members are pseudonymous and anonymous, and wear balaclavas during almost all of their public appearances. However, most of their names have been revealed (see below).

Current

;Former

St. Peenis also played saxophone on earlier recordings. Cheese plays guitar on various recordings and live shows, and Blackman arranged orchestral sections on &quot;The White Albun&quot; (2004). Flaubert programs rhythms and samples, and has occasionally played acoustic drumkits live.

There has been more than one person performing under the Les Miserables name, as confirmed by Sean Kelly (Leak Van Vlalen) during the &quot;RealiTISM&quot; video.

===Identities===
TISM have never officially revealed their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, all the while concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle, fat &#x27;businessman&#x27; suits, and eight-foot-high inflatable headpieces among others.

Who TISM are beneath the masks has been the cause of much speculation by fans, with one theory contending that TISM is composed of members of other bands who do not want their fans to find out: popular targets of this theory include Painters and Dockers, Machine Gun Fellatio and even The Wiggles. A theory based on the band&#x27;s tour schedule&#x27;s roughly coinciding with school holidays, and the fact that the Ringwood Secondary College Choir and Orchestra feature in the filmclip to Thunderbirds Are Coming Out, proposes that TISM are school teachers. Another common theory, based on the high incidence of Australian rules football references in their lyrics, is that they are or were players in the AFL, however Humphrey B. Flaubert has stated that &quot;We&#x27;re actually not AFL, we&#x27;re more violent and crappy... so you&#x27;re looking at the VFL there.&quot;

When asked why they wear masks, Flaubert replied:
However, when TISM performed on &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot; in 2002 playing &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; on instruments from Greece, the song writers&#x27; names were revealed during the credit roll which read &quot;&#x27;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&#x27; by Damian Cowell / Peter Minack / Jack Holt / James Paull / Eugene Cester ... Performed by TISM.&quot; Up until then, the songwriters&#x27; names were publicly available on the APRA/AMCOS database, but now the songwriting credits on the site just say &quot;TISM&quot; instead of the members&#x27; real names; Damian Cowell&#x27;s real name is listed as one of the songwriters of ROOT!&#x27;s songs, however.

The song writers&#x27; names were also published later, alongside information on &quot;Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me&quot; when it hit success in Sweden and Germany in 2004.

However, vigilant fans would have noticed the names some years earlier: Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 at the opening night of Madame Butterfly, which was published on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (&quot;Campaigning With Grant&quot;) in 2000 about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans, and that he is fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, explaining his stage moniker.

Guitarist Tokin Blackman&#x27;s real name was James &quot;Jock&quot; Paull. Paull died of cancer on 9 April 2008 at the age of 50.

Eugene Cester was revealed in an &quot;Age&quot; column as being the uncle of Nic and Chris Cester of Melbourne&#x27;s Jet, however, it did not state which member he is. It is believed that he is Eugene De La Hot Croix Bun.

On 28 March 2007, a Myspace page opened for a Melbourne band called Root! which the lead singer claimed to be &quot;the friend of the uncle of the guys in Jet&quot;. The page also lists James Paull as a &quot;friend&quot;. Humphrey B. Flaubert&#x27;s real name is Damian Cowell, who performs in the band as D.C. Root.

=== Timeline ===
==Style==
TISM are distinguished from other &quot;joke&quot; or &quot;gimmick&quot; bands by, among other things, their musical style. The band rarely, in any seriousness, state actual influences on the type of music they played, except that The Residents were a band which TISM &quot;did&quot; notice and &quot;possibly&quot; took some influence from. A clear link can be drawn from The Residents&#x27; 1977 promotional video &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, in which that group wore Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspapers (TISM did exactly this at their first gig). Other bands which may have influenced TISM are difficult to pinpoint, although a &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; article on the band described them as &quot;a cross between Skyhooks, Dave Warner, Talking Heads and The Residents&quot;.

In 2021, co-founder Humphrey B. Flaubert noted that part of the band&#x27;s style was &quot;never breaking out of character. Whether that character was 99% the real us, it was still a character. Listen to any interview and you&#x27;ll get the sense that those guys are constantly &#x27;on&#x27;. The persona never wanes. The metaphorical mask never drops. And while that may have annoyed some journalists, it&#x27;s what set that band apart from every other band. It&#x27;s what made that band&#x27;s interviews more interesting for the listener than fucking Joe Blow going on about the creative inspiration behind his new album.&quot;

Recurring lyrical themes are present throughout TISM&#x27;s catalog, the most common being death, violence, fame and prominent figures, drugs, including alcohol, and the Australian Football League. Many of TISM&#x27;s lyrics are tinged in fatalism, mocking both the superficial and the sublime side of the human condition and the desire for people to be loved and respected (even just in the titles of such songs as &quot;If You&#x27;re Not Famous at Fourteen, You&#x27;re Finished&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Ugly, Forget It&quot; and &quot;Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me&quot;).

TISM&#x27;s early keyboard sound was provided by an Optigan which keyboardist Eugene de la Hot-Croix Bun ran through a flanger. They mainly use standard tuning; however, Eb tuning and drop D were employed in some songs. Jock Cheese&#x27;s bass is prominent in the songs to a degree that head of Festival Mushroom Records, Michael Parisi, described the sound as &quot;aggressive&quot;.

The band were sometimes criticised as unoriginal for continually opting for standard pop song structures. One reason for this is clarified in their book, &quot;The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics&quot;, in the following paragraphs, when asked why their ideas are post-modern but their music is not:
&quot;Give me a pop-song, mate. Give me a fucking pop-song. Not only is it more fun, it&#x27;s pretty fuckin&#x27; hard to write as well. You can bung in as many out-of-tune oboes as you want, but putting chords together so they sound pleasant isn&#x27;t as simple as it might appear. It mightn&#x27;t be the Sistine Chapel, but what is? Ollie fucking Olsen with his stupid feedback and cough mixture? The Jesus and Mary Chain, with their stupid feedback, and their stupid stage show with 800 powerful stupid lights and enough stupid dry ice to enhance their stupid stupidity up its own bullshit crappy teenage pretentious one dimensional dick witted puissant artistic enigma?

So ... what have you listened to for a good time that isn&#x27;t, after all, a &#x27;traditional&#x27; song? Still playing the Mike Oldfield records, huh? Still whipping &quot;Yessongs&quot; on for a good time? Wanna count on one hand how many people have fun at a Sonic Youth gig? I&#x27;m not supporting The Choirboys, old man, I&#x27;m just saying that the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist cocksucker puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer in the middle of his 47-minute opus &quot;The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig-God&quot; and belts out the chords to &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is the day I&#x27;ll join you at the footlights of post-modernism.

Besides which, pop songs sell more.&quot;

<text>The conga, also known as tumbadora, is a tall, narrow, single-headed drum from Cuba. Congas are staved like barrels and classified into three types: quinto (lead drum, highest), tres dos or tres golpes (middle), and tumba or salidor (lowest). Congas were originally used in Afro-Cuban music genres such as conga (hence their name) and rumba, where each drummer would play a single drum. Following numerous innovations in conga drumming and construction during the mid-20th century, as well as its internationalization, it became increasingly common for drummers to play two or three drums. Congas have become a popular instrument in many forms of Latin music such as son (when played by conjuntos), descarga, Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, songo, merengue and Latin rock.

Although the exact origins of the conga drum are unknown, researchers agree that it was developed by Cuban people of African descent during the late 19th century or early 20th century. Its direct ancestors are thought to be the yuka and makuta (of Bantu origin) and the bembé drums (of Yoruba origin). In Cuba and Latin America, congas are primarily played as hand drums. In Trinidadian calypso and soca, congas are sometimes struck with mallets, while in the Congos, they are often struck with one hand and one mallet.

==Characteristics==
Most modern congas have a staved wooden or fiberglass shell and a screw-tensioned drumhead. Since the 1950s, congas are usually played in sets of two to four, except for traditional rumba and conga, in which each drummer plays one conga. The drums are played with the fingers and palms of the hands. Typical congas stand approximately from the bottom of the shell to the head. The drums may be played while seated. Alternatively, the drums may be mounted on a rack or stand to permit the player to play while standing. While they originated in Cuba, their incorporation into the popular and folk music of other countries has resulted in diversification of terminology for the instruments and the players. In Cuba, &quot;congas&quot; are called &quot;tumbadoras&quot;.

Conga players are called &quot;congueros&quot;, while &quot;rumberos&quot; refers to those who dance following the path of the players. The term &quot;conga&quot; was popularized in the 1930s, when Latin music swept the United States. Cuban son and New York jazz fused together to create what was then termed mambo, but later became known as salsa. In that same period, the popularity of the conga line helped to spread this new term. Desi Arnaz also played a role in the popularization of conga drums. However, the drum he played (which everyone called a conga drum at the time) was similar to the type of drum known as &quot;bokú&quot; used in his hometown, Santiago de Cuba. The word &quot;conga&quot; came from the rhythm &quot;la conga&quot; used during &quot;carnaval&quot; (carnival) in Cuba. The drums used in carnaval could have been referred to as &quot;tambores de conga&quot; since they played the rhythm &quot;la conga&quot;, and thus translated into English as &quot;conga drums&quot;.

==Types of drum==
Conga drums are classified according to their size, which correlates to their pitch: larger drumheads have a lower pitch and vice versa. Originally, drums were tuned by adjusting knots and tension ropes on the drumhead, or, more commonly, where the drum heads were tacked or nailed to the top of the shell, by careful heating of the head. Modern congas, developed in the early 1950s, use a screw-and-lug tension head system, which makes them easier to tune (or detune). This modern type of tension system was pioneered in Cuba by Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdés and in the United States by Cándido Camero.

Historically, terminology for the drums varies between genres and countries. In ensembles that traditionally employ a large number of drums, such as comparsas and rumba groups, a detailed naming system is used, which has been taken up by major conga manufacturers. The drums are listed from largest to smallest diameter (drumhead sizes vary considerably by manufacturer, model, and style):

* The &quot;supertumba&quot; or &quot;rebajador&quot; can be as large as .
* The &quot;tumba&quot; or &quot;salidor&quot; is typically .
* The &quot;conga&quot; or &quot;tres dos&quot; is typically .
* The &quot;quinto&quot; is typically around .
* The &quot;requinto&quot; can be smaller than .
* The &quot;ricardo&quot; can be as small as . Since this drum is typically played while hanging from a shoulder strap, it is considerably shorter and narrower than a traditional conga.

In &quot;conjuntos&quot; that play son cubano, as well as in charangas and other ensembles where one or two congas were introduced to complement other rhythmic instruments, the drums are named like the bongos: &quot;macho&quot; (male) and &quot;hembra&quot; (female), for the higher and lower-pitched drums, respectively; an additional drum would be called &quot;tercera&quot; (third). These correspond to the &quot;tumba&quot; and &quot;conga&quot; in rumba ensembles. When the &quot;quinto&quot; is played by &quot;conjuntos&quot; it retains its name.

==Tuning==

Congas, being percussive instruments, do not have to be tuned to any particular note in purely percussive settings. However, when playing with harmonic instruments, they may be tuned to specific notes. Congas are often tuned using the open tone. In general, the particular note will depend on the make, model, and size of the conga drum. The drum should be tuned so that the bass tone resonates, the open tone rings, and the slap pierces through the musical mix. If the tuning is too loose, the bass and slap tones will sound &quot;flabby&quot;; too tight, and the drums will sound unnatural and &quot;pinched&quot;. With a single drum, it is easy to tighten the drum until it makes a pleasing sound and then tighten a little more to reach a uniform desired pitch. It is very important to ensure that tuning is uniform around the drumhead, which can be checked by placing one finger pad in the center of the head and tapping the head near the edge above each lug location to detect any change, adjusting as necessary. Uniform tightness will help &quot;let the drum speak&quot;.

Another important consideration is that head tension can greatly impact the ease or unease of the player, and generally a looser drumhead can lead to hand injury more than a tighter one, because a looser drumhead has less rebound and more muffling effect (hence potentially bruising joints and bones under spirited playing). Also, producing a crisp slap tone is nearly impossible on a loose head. During tuning it is suggested to &quot;let the drum speak&quot; and to conform tuning reasonably closely to the natural resonance (pitch) that the cavity of the drum interior presents. This resonance can be heard by singing or playing loud notes near the drum opening (this is true of tuning any drum) and noticing which pitch decays slowest - that will either be the fundamental (resonant) frequency or one of its simple overtones.

When two or more drums are used, there is the potential for more variation of which notes are chosen; however, tuning between or during compositions is rare in live performance. With only two drums, it is common to find them tuned a perfect fourth apart (the interval between the first two notes of &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot;) as is the tradition in western classical music for the timpani. Having three drums (typically the &quot;tumba&quot;, &quot;conga&quot;, and &quot;quinto&quot;) invites experimentation and individual customization. Some &quot;congueros&quot; like using the intervals of a major chord (e.g. F, A, C). Some players use the second inversion of a major chord (e.g. G, C, E); and some prefer a major second between the &quot;quinto&quot; and &quot;conga&quot;, with a perfect 4th descending to the &quot;tumba&quot;. Raul Rekow of Santana often plays five conga drums and tunes them to the opening phrase of a Latin tune.

==Playing techniques==
===Strokes===
====Strokes with one hand====
* 1. &quot;Tono abierto&quot;. Open tone.
* 2. &quot;Tono ahogado (apagado)&quot;. Muffled tone.
* 3. &quot;Tono seco abierto&quot;. Open slap.
* 4. &quot;Tono seco tapado&quot;. Pressed slap.
* 5. &quot;Tono seco cerrado&quot;. Closed slap.
* 6. &quot;Tono bajo de palma&quot;. Bass tone.
* 7. &quot;Tono de talón de mano&quot;. Heel tone.
* 8. &quot;Toque de punta de mano&quot;. Tip tone.
* 9. &quot;Tono de uñas&quot;. Fingernails tone.
* 10. &quot;Tono deslizado&quot;. Glissando tone.

====Basic strokes====
There are four basic strokes in conga drumming:
*Open tone (&quot;tono abierto&quot;): played with the four fingers near the rim of the head, producing a clear resonant sound with a higher pitch than muffled and bass tones.
*Muffled, muted, closed of flesh tone (&quot;tono ahogado&quot; or &quot;apagado&quot;) or simply &quot;muff&quot;: like the open tone, it is made by striking the drum with the four fingers, but holding the fingers against the head to muffle the tone. It can also be played with a cupped hand or the heel of the hand.
*Bass tone (&quot;tono bajo&quot;): played with the full palm, in a slightly cupped position, somewhat off center on the head. It produces a low muted sound.
*Slap tone (&quot;tono seco&quot; or &quot;tapado&quot;): the most difficult technique, producing a loud clear &quot;popping&quot; sound. The muted or pressed slap tone (&quot;toque tapado normal&quot;) involves playing an open tone while the other hand rests on the drumhead, which produces a higher pitch. There are open (&quot;tono tapado abierto&quot;) and half-open (&quot;tono tapado semi-abierto&quot;) variants, in which the playing hand briefly rests on the edge of the drumhead after the stroke, followed by another stroke with the other hand. When played at fast and short intervals, this is called &quot;floreo&quot;, which is often used to instill emotion in the dancers.

Other strokes can be used to enhance the timbral palette of the instrument. They are not used by all drummers, but have become the hallmark of &quot;congeros&quot; such as Tata Güines.
*Touch or toe tone (&quot;toque de punta&quot;): as implied by the name, this tone is produced by just touching the fingers or heel of the palm to the drum head. It is possible to alternate a touch of the palm with a touch of the fingers in a maneuver called heel-toe (manoteo), which can be used to produce the conga equivalent of drumrolls.
*Nails stroke (&quot;toque de uñas&quot;): played with the tip of the nails, usually finger by finger in quick succession, starting with the pinky.

====Glissando and pitch bending====
The &quot;deslizado&quot;, &quot;moose call&quot; or &quot;glissando&quot; is done by rubbing the third finger, supported by the thumb, across the head of the drum. The finger is sometimes moistened with saliva or sweat, and sometimes a little coat of beeswax is put on the surface of the conga head to help make the sound. The moose call is also done on the bongos.

To bend the pitch of the congas, a &quot;conguero&quot; sometimes uses his elbow to shift around on and apply pressure to different parts of the head; this causes the note to change. This is not a traditional stroke, but it is common in modern salsa and rumba.

==Rhythms==
===Guaguancó===
Guaguancó uses three congas. The smallest conga is the lead drum known as quinto. The following nine-measure quinto excerpt is from the guaguancó “La polémica” by Los Muñequitos de Matanzas (1988). This passage moves between the main modes of playing (A, B, C). The A section is the basic &quot;lock&quot; or &quot;ride&quot;, as it is known in North America. It spans one clave (measure). An alternate phrase (B) is also one measure in length. Cross-beats, the basis of the third section (C), contradict the meter. By alternating between the lock and the cross, the quinto creates larger rhythmic phrases that expand and contract over several clave cycles. Los Muñequintos quintero Jesús Alfonso (1949–2009) described this phenomenon as a man getting “drunk at a party, going outside for a while, and then coming back inside.”

===Marcha (tumbao)===
====Clave-neutral====
The basic son montuno conga pattern is called &quot;marcha&quot;, or tumbao. The conga was first used in bands during the late 1930s, and became a staple of mambo bands of the 1940s. The primary strokes are sounded with open tones, on the last offbeats (2&amp;, 2a) of a two-beat cycle. The fundamental accent—2&amp; is referred to by some musicians as &quot;ponche&quot;.

====Clave-aligned====
The basic tumbao sounds slaps (triangle noteheads) and open tones (regular noteheads) on the &quot;and&quot; offbeats. There are many variations on the basic tumbao. For example, a very common variant sounds a single open tone with the third stroke of clave (ponche), and two tones preceding the three-side of clave. The specific alignment between clave and this tumbao is critical.

Another common variant uses two drums and sounds &quot;bombo&quot; (1a) on the tumba (3-side of the clave). For example:

===Bolero===
There is also the bolero rhythm that is used for ballads. The conga part is similar to the marcha.

===Songo===
Beginning in the late 1960s, band conga players began incorporating elements from folkloric rhythms, especially rumba. Changuito and Raúl &quot;el Yulo&quot; Cárdenas of Los Van Van pioneered this approach of the songo era.

This relationship between the drums is derived from the style known as rumba. The feeling of the high drum part is like the quinto in rumba, constantly punctuating, coloring, and accenting, but not soloing until the appropriate moment (Santos 1985).

In several songo arrangements, the tumbadora (&#x27;conga&#x27;) part sounds the typical tumbao on the low-pitched drum, while replicating the quinto (lead drum) of guaguancó on the high-pitched drum. The quinto-like phrases can continually change, but they are based upon a specific counter-clave motif. [See: &quot;Songo Patterns on Congas&quot; (Changuito).

===Timba===
Tomás Cruz developed several adaptations of folkloric rhythms when working in Paulito FG&#x27;s timba band of the 1990s. Cruz&#x27;s creations offered clever counterpoints to the bass and chorus. Many of his marchas span two or even four claves in duration, something very rarely done previously. He also made more use of muted tones in his tumbaos, all the while advancing the development of . The example on the right is one of Cruz&#x27;s &quot;inventos&quot; (&#x27;musical inventions&#x27;), a band adaptation of the Congolese-based Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm &quot;makuta&quot;. He played the pattern on three congas on the Paulito song &quot;Llamada anónima.&quot; Listen: &quot;Llamada Anónima&quot; by Paulito F.G. 

===Other genres===
The conga repertoire includes many other rhythms found in genres such as danzón, mambo and cha-cha-cha, as well as foreign styles that have adopted Afro-Cuban percussion such as Jamaican reggae, Brazilian samba and bossa nova, and American soul, funk, Latin jazz and Latin rock. In the 1960s, the conga became a prominent instrument in Haitian popular music styles such as konpa, yeye and mini-djaz.

Conjuntos and orchestras playing Colombian dance music have incorporated cumbia rhythms, traditionally played on tambores known as alegre and llamador, to the conga drums. The standard Colombian cumbia rhythm is simple and played slowly; it goes 1-2-2-1, also heard as 1-2-1-2. In the Dominican Republic, the fast merengue rhythm, which goes 1 2-1-2, can be played on the conga. It can also be heard as 1-2-1-2 1-2-1-2-1-2. Essentially, it is the rhythm of the tambora applied to conga. In merengue típico (or &quot;cibaeño&quot;), the rhythm is usually more complex and less standardized; it can range from simply hitting the conga on a fourth beat to playing full patterns that mark the time.

<text>The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a computer based test for admission in graduate management programs. The test consists of three sections: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning, and Quantitative Ability. The exam was taken online over a period of three hours, with one hour per section. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 precautions, Indian Institute of Management Indore decided to conduct the CAT Exam in 2 hours with 40 minutes devoted to each section. The Indian Institutes of Management started this exam and use the test for selecting students for their business administration programs (MBA or PGDM). The test is conducted every year by one of the Indian Institutes of Managements(IIMs) based on a policy of rotation.

In August 2011, it was announced that Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) would also use the CAT scores, instead of the Joint Management Entrance Test (JMET), to select students for their management programmes starting with the 2012-15 batch.

Before 2010, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates. The pattern, number of questions and duration have seen considerable variations over the years.

On 1 May 2009, it was announced that CAT would be a Computer Based Test starting from 2009. The American firm Prometric was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the test from 2009 to 2013. The first computer based CAT was marred with technical snags. The issue was so serious that it prompted the Government of India to seek a report from the convenor. The trouble was diagnosed as &#x27;Conficker&#x27; and &#x27;W32 Nimda&#x27;, the two viruses that attacked the system display of the test, causing server slow down. Since 2014 onward, CAT has been conducted by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). CAT 2015 and CAT 2016 were 180-minute tests consisting of 100 questions (34 from Quantitative Ability, 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning. CAT 2020 onwards, the exam duration has been reduced to two hours, with 40 minutes allotted per section.

== Eligibility for CAT ==
The candidate must satisfy the below specified criteria:

# Hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree, with not less than 50% or equal CGPA (45% for Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Persons with Disability (PWD)/Differently Able (DA) classification)
# The degree should be granted by any of the universities consolidated by an act of the central or state statutory body in India or other instructive organizations built up by an act of Parliament or pronounced to be considered as a university under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956, or possess an equivalent qualification recognized by the Ministry of HRD, Government of India.
# Competitors appearing for the final year of bachelor&#x27;s degree/equivalent qualification examination and the individuals who have finished degree prerequisites and are anticipating results can likewise apply. If selected, such applicants will be permitted to join the program temporarily, only if they present a certificate most recent by June of next year in which the exam is held, from the principal/registrar of their college/institute (issued at the latest 30th June of that year) expressing that the competitor has finished every one of the prerequisites for acquiring four-year or three-year college education/identical capability on the date of the issue of the certificate.

== Exam pattern ==
The Common Admission Test (CAT), like virtually all large-scale exams, utilises multiple forms, or versions, of the test. Hence there are two types of scores involved: a raw score and a scaled score.

The raw score is calculated for each section based on the number of questions one answered correctly, incorrectly, or left unattempted. Candidates are given +3 points for each correct answer and -1 point for each incorrect answer, no negative marking for TITA (Type in the Answer) questions. No points are given for questions that are not answered. The raw scores are then adjusted through a process called equating. Equated raw scores are then placed on a common scale or metric to ensure appropriate interpretation of the scores. This process is called &#x27;scaling&#x27;.

The change in the total number of questions and number of questions per section in CAT can vary by year. On the whole, there are 66 number of questions combining each section. The very first section which is the verbal ability and reading comprehension contains 24 questions, further bifurcating 16 questions of reading comprehension and 8 questions of verbal ability, then next section is of data interpretation and logical reasoning which contains 20 questions and the last section is of quantitative ability which contains 22 questions making it to 66 questions in total.

CAT is conducted in three slots/sessions (Morning Slot, Afternoon Slot, Evening Slot).

===CAT Pattern and Duration===
Source:

Three 40-minute sessions will be held to conduct the CAT 2024 exam. A total of 120 minutes will be given. The CAT exam pattern will consist of Multiple Choice Question and non-multiple-choice questions or TITA {Type In The Answer} questions. The three sections in the exam are as follows:

* Verbal Ability &amp; Reading Comprehension (VARC)
* Data Interpretation &amp; Logical Reasoning (DILR)
* Quantitative Ability (QA)

-&gt; 24 questions are asked in VARC out which 8 questions are of VA (Para jumble - 2 TITA questions, Para summary - 2 MCQ questions, Odd one out - 2 TITA questions, Sentence Placement - 2 MCQ questions) 16 questions of RC are asked by 4 passages with 4 questions in each passage (all questions are of MCQ type).

-&gt; 20 questions are asked in DILR, questions are asked in 4 sets with 6-6-4-4 or 5-5-5-5 pattern.

-&gt; 22 questions are asked in QA, 22 independent questions are asked from topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Number System &amp; Modern Math.

There will be a maximum score of 198 marks and 66 total questions in the CAT exam pattern.

Candidates cannot jump between the three sections while taking the exam. The order of the sections is fixed: VARC -&gt; DILR -&gt; QA.

<doc id="471974" wikidata="Q3112578" url="?curid=471974" title="Consensus government in Canada">
<text>Consensus government is a form of government by consensus decision-making in Canada used in two of Canada&#x27;s three federal territories (Northwest Territories and Nunavut) as well as in Nunatsiavut, an autonomous area in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The population of these jurisdictions are majority Indigenous peoples. The system developed in the Northwest Territories beginning during the 1970s, and was adopted by Nunavut when it came into existence in 1999.

==Origins and development==

In 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were separated from the then much larger Northwest Territories. The Yukon Territory had been created in 1898 to facilitate governance of the Yukon goldfields, and both Ontario and Quebec were granted large areas of northern lands. The remaining lands were considered to be unsettled by Europeans, largely inhabited by Dene, Métis and Inuit, and not requiring much governance. The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, a functionary reporting to the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs in Ottawa, was given plenary governing authority.

A legislative council was convened from time to time of worthy notables, learned in matters involving the natives and northern development. The 2nd Council of the Northwest Territories met sporadically, typically in Ottawa, and passed ordinances for the benefit of the territory.

Beginning during the 1950s and 1960s, some residents of the territory were appointed or elected to the council. These elected members were initially non-native, but in growing number, were Dene, Métis and Inuit. Members began to secure positions on the executive council, replacing appointed Ottawa administrators, and began to insist on a devolution of authority. In a series of letters, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs gradually curtailed the authority of the commissioner and affirmed the authority of the assembly.

The first fully elected executive council elected in 1980 was led by George Braden, and the system of consensus government developed from that date.

==Choosing leadership==
Members of the legislature are elected as independents from single member districts by simple plurality voting. The legislature selects first the speaker, then the premier, and finally the cabinet members from amongst themselves. In each instance the candidate must obtain a majority of the votes cast. This means that multiple rounds of voting, a variant of the two-round system, may occur before the successful candidate is elected.

The premier has three main authorities. The premier:
# names the portfolios of each minister and can remove or adjust these,
# controls the agenda of the cabinet/executive council, and
# hires, rewards, and dismisses the deputy department heads.

The passage of legislation and the government is dependent on retaining the confidence of the legislature. However, due to the absence of political parties there is no formal opposition and instead of party caucuses members regularly participate in a caucus of all members of the legislature.

<doc id="471976" wikidata="Q6595951" url="?curid=471976" title="List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons">
<text>Squadrons are the main form of flying unit of the Royal Air Force (RAF). These include Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) squadrons incorporated into the RAF when it was formed on 1 April 1918, during the First World War. Other squadrons of the RAF include those from Commonwealth air forces which have served within the RAF structure and squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm before it transferred to the Royal Navy in 1939.

Some squadrons have an individual tradition of presenting their squadron number in Roman numerals or using a suffix to their squadron number (such as &quot;(F)&quot; for &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;(B)&quot; for &quot;Bomber&quot; or &quot;(AC)&quot; for &quot;Army Co-operation&quot;) to indicate a past or present role. An example would be No. 18 (Bomber) Squadron RAF which currently actually operates the heavy-lift Chinook helicopter. However, these practices have, at least in the past, been deprecated at higher levels and generally only apply to certain squadrons with long traditions, especially those numbered from 1 to 20. Historical Squadrons can choose to &#x27;lay up&#x27; their standards at RAF Cranwell or in places of worship following disbandment.

Flying training units and operational evaluation squadrons have generally been (Reserve) squadrons, although they are regular active-duty units. The policy of the (Reserve) numberplate was rescinded in February 2018, to coincide with the renaming of 22 (Training) Group to just 22 Group in line with other RAF Groups.

Some Squadron names include the location they were originally formed.

==Regular RFC, RNAS, and RAF squadrons (Nos. 1–299)==
Squadrons in Bold Type are currently active

===Nos. 1–50===
===Nos. 51–66===
===Nos. 67–71===
During the First World War, in order to avoid confusion with similarly numbered British flying squadrons, units of the separate Australian Flying Corps were known for administrative purposes as 67, 68, 69, and 71 squadrons. Since the Second World War these numbers have always been used by RAF units.

However, the designation 70 (or LXX) Squadron has always been used for RFC/RAF units.

* No. 67 Squadron
** 1916–18: No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps 
** From 1941: No. 67 Squadron
* No. 68 Squadron
** 1916–18: No. 2 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps
** From 1941: No. 68 Squadron
* No. 69 Squadron RAF
** 1916–18: No. 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps
** From 1941: No. 69 Squadron
* No. LXX Squadron (Atlas C1)
* No. 71 Squadron
** 1916–18: No. 4 Squadron Australian Flying Corps
** From 1940: No. 71 Squadron (staffed by US volunteers in 1940–42)

===Nos. 72–100===
===Nos. 101–150===
===Nos. 151–200===
===Nos. 201–250===
The first squadrons to carry numbers above 200 were former RNAS squadrons that were renumbered upon amalgamation with 200 added to their RNAS squadron number. Independent flights of the RNAS were grouped together in squadrons and given numbers in the 200 series.

===Nos. 251–299===
==Nos. 300–352==
Squadrons in the 300–352 series were staffed during the Second World War by volunteers from countries in occupied Europe. In some cases, these RAF squadrons and personnel were regarded by a relevant government-in-exile as serving concurrently with its air force.

Similarly, in 1940–42, three &quot;Eagle Squadrons&quot; were composed of volunteers from the US: No. 71 (Eagle) Squadron, later 334th Fighter Squadron USAAF; No. 121 (Eagle) Squadron, later 335th Fighter Squadron USAAF and No. 133 (Eagle) Squadron, later 336th Fighter Squadron USAAF.

===Polish (300–309)===
:&quot;See also Squadrons Nos. 315–318, 663 and Polish Fighting Team (under Other)&quot;
* No. 300 &quot;Land of Masovia&quot; Polish Bomber Squadron (&quot;Ziemi Mazowieckiej&quot;)
* No. 301 &quot;Land of Pomerania&quot; Polish Bomber Squadron (&quot;Ziemi Pomorskiej&quot;)
* No. 302 &quot;City of Poznań&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron (&quot;Poznański&quot;)
* No. 303 &quot;Kosciuszko&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron (&quot;Warszawski im. Tadeusza Kościuszki&quot;)
* No. 304 &quot;Land of Silesia&quot; Polish Bomber Squadron (&quot;Ziemi Śląskiej im. Ks. Józefa Poniatowskiego&quot;)
* No. 305 &quot;Land of Greater Poland&quot; Polish Bomber Squadron (&quot;Ziemi Wielkopolskiej im. Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego&quot;)
* No. 306 &quot;City of Toruń&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron (&quot;Toruński&quot;)
* No. 307 &quot;City of Lwów&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron (&quot;Lwowskich Puchaczy&quot;)
* No. 308 &quot;City of Kraków&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron (&quot;Krakowski&quot;)
* No. 309 &quot;Land of Czerwień&quot; Polish Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron (&quot;Ziemi Czerwieńskiej&quot;)

===Czechoslovakian (310–313)===

(Note: the RAF has never had a flying unit named 314 Squadron, although it has used the number for No. 314 Technical Services Unit. A proposed 314 Squadron was allocated squadron code &quot;UY&quot; during the period April to September 1939, but was never formed.)

===Polish (315–318)===
:&quot;See also Squadrons Nos. 300–309, 663 and Polish Fighting Team (under Other)&quot;
Note: the RAF never had a No. 319 Squadron; the &quot;Polish Fighting Team&quot; was attached to No. 145 Fighter Squadron. A proposed 319 Squadron was allocated squadron codes VE for the period April to September 1939. There was also 663 Artillery Observation Squadron; No. 138 Special Duty Squadron Polish Flight &quot;C&quot; and No. 1586 Polish Special Duty Flight.

===Dutch (320–325)===

Note: Nos. 323 to 325 Squadrons were not formed, but allocated Squadron Codes GN, PQ and EA respectively for the period April to September 1939. However these numbers were used for post-war Royal Netherlands Air Force squadrons.

===French (326–329)===
:&quot;See also Nos. 340–347 Squadron&quot;
===Norwegian (330–334)===
===Greek (335–339)===
Note: Nos: 337–339 never formed, but were allocated Squadron Codes OK, ML and KN respectively for the period April to September 1939. The Royal Hellenic Air Force 13th Light Bomber Squadron was also under RAF command in World War II.

===French (340–347)===
:&quot;See also Nos. 326–329 Squadron&quot;

Note: No. 348 Squadron was not formed, but Squadron codes letters FR were allocated for the period April to September 1939.

===Belgian (349–350)===
===Yugoslavian (351–352)===
==Nos. 353–361==
Note: Nos. 362–399 Squadrons were not formed.

== Article XV squadrons of World War II (Nos. 400–490) ==
Under Article XV of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the air forces of Australia, Canada and New Zealand formed squadrons for service under RAF operational control. Most were new formations, however some had already existed prior to the creation of Article XV and had already been operational during the war, including combat operations.

===Royal Canadian Air Force (400–443)===

Note: Although squadron numbers 444 to 449 were also reserved for the RCAF, it did not use them during the Second World War.

===Royal Australian Air Force (450–467)===

Note: Although squadron numbers 465 and 468 to 479 were also reserved for the RAAF during the Second World War, it did not use them.

===Royal New Zealand Air Force (485–490)===

Note: Although the squadron numbers 491 to 499 were reserved for RNZAF units during the Second World War, no such squadrons were formed.

==Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadrons (Nos. 500–509)==
Formed as &quot;Special Reserve&quot; squadrons but absorbed into the Royal Auxiliary Air Force
Note: No. 505, 506, 507, 508 and 509 Squadrons allocated Squadron codes YF, FS, GX, DY and BQ respectively for the period April to September 1939, but were never formed. A non-flying 505 Squadron was formed as a General Support Squadron in 2015.

==Regular RAF squadrons (Nos. 510–598)==

Note: No No. 599 Squadron seems to have been formed. There were to have been Reserve squadrons using numbers &quot;551–566&quot; which would have been created by adding 500 to existing Operational Training Unit designations. In the event the plan was never put into effect, although there was some desultory use of some of the numbers by some of the OTUs for a short period. Despite their lack of formal activation, this block of numbers has never been re-allocated for use by other units.

==Advanced Training Squadrons (550–565)==
In the event of a German Invasion the Operational Training Units would have been re-formed into the Squadrons below, under plans as part of &quot;Operation Saracen&quot;, formulated in Spring 1940, which were later revised as &quot;Operation Banquet&quot;. Some reserve Squadron numbers were used by their respective OTU&#x27;s during operational tasks until at least May 1944.

*No. 550 Squadron – Air Fighting Development Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 551 Squadron – 51 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 552 Squadron – 51 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 553 Squadron – 53 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 554 Squadron – 53 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 555 Squadron – 55 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 556 Squadron – 56 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 557 Squadron – 57 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 558 Squadron – 58 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 559 Squadron – 59 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 560 Squadron – 56 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 561 Squadron – 61 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Saracen&quot; and &quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 562 Squadron – 57 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 563 Squadron – 58 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 564 Squadron – 59 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)
*No. 565 Squadron – 61 Operational Training Unit (&quot;Banquet&quot;)

==Royal Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons (600–616)==

Note: No. 606 Squadron RAF was allocated Squadron codes BG for the period April to September 1939, but was not formed. A non-flying No. 606 Helicopter Support Squadron of the RAuxAF was later formed in 1999.

==Regular RAF squadrons (Nos. 617–650)==
Note: Nos. 629, 632–634, 636–638, 641–643 and 645–649 were never formed, but some were allocated Squadron codes for the period April to September 1939 – 629 (LQ), 632 (LO), 636 (VZ), 637 (UK), 638 (PZ), 641 (EV), 645 (KF), 646 (YG), 647 (ZS), 648 (YT) and 649 (HA). However a fictional &quot;633 Squadron&quot; was featured in the eponymous novel and film. In addition, a fictional 641 Squadron featured in the film &quot;Mosquito Squadron&quot;. Also, RAF Volunteer Gliding Squadrons (formerly Volunteer Gliding Schools until 2005) have been numbered in the range 611 to 671 since 1955.

==Air observation post squadrons==
These squadrons were formed during the Second World War to perform artillery spotting and liaison roles, in co-operation with Army units. Most AOP squadron aircrew were provided by the Army. Nos. 661–664 and 666 Squadron were re-formed as Royal Auxiliary Air Force units in 1949. Nos. 651, 652 and 656 Squadron were transferred to the Army Air Corps in 1957.
==Regular RAF squadrons (Nos. 667–695)==

Note: Nos. 693–694 and 696–699 Squadrons were never formed.

==Fleet Air Arm squadrons==

While still under the control of the Royal Air Force, flights of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were organised into squadrons with numbers in the 700 and 800 range. The range 700 to 750 had been previously used for Fleet Air Arm Catapult Flight numbers.

These squadrons were transferred to the Royal Navy (RN) in 1939, becoming Royal Naval Air Squadrons (RNAS). The 700 and 800 range of squadron numbers continued to be used by the Royal Navy for newly formed Royal Naval Air Squadrons.

==Training Depot Stations==
Training Depot Stations (TDS) were still in use after the formation of the Royal Air Force in 1918.
==University Air Squadrons==

The majority of Universities in the United Kingdom are, or have been, represented by Royal Air Force (RAF) University Air Squadrons (UAS), where under-graduates can sample elements of the Royal Air Force, and learn to fly, as well as take advantage of scholarship schemes. Previously operating the Bulldog T.1, they now all currently operate the Tutor T.1. Although each UAS retain their own identity an activities, when two are co-located at the same airfield, such as Cambridge UAS and London UAS at RAF Wittering, and Liverpool UAS and Manchester and Salford UAS at RAF Woodvale, the two individual UAS share the same fleet of aircraft. All University Air Squadrons are currently commanded by No. 6 Flying Training School RAF (6FTS).

Squadrons below listed in bold are currently active, others are disbanded, or otherwise amalgamated into a current existing UAS.

== Air Experience Flights ==
Air Experience Flights are co-located with University Air Squadrons and operate the Tutor T1 training aircraft.

==Volunteer Gliding Squadrons==

Initially formed as Gliding Schools (GS), and then renamed Volunteer Gliding Schools (VGS), these squadrons retained their gliding school numbers when reformed as squadrons. Conflicts with the main squadron numbers resolved by the VGS suffix. The currently active squadrons, now part of 2 Flying Training School (2FTS) headquartered at RAF Syerston along with the Central Gliding School, all operate the Viking T1 winch-launched sailplane glider.

==Independent Flights==
The Royal Air Force (RAF) maintains a number of independent flights; some on a permanent basis, others on an ad-hoc basis as required. Historically, some flights were alphabetically named. For a full list, see the list of Royal Air Force aircraft independent flights.
Bold listings are currently active RAF flights.
*Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) – at RAF Coningsby – 6x Spitfire (various marks), 2x Hurricane, 1x Lancaster, 1x Dakota, 2x Chipmunk T10
*No. 1310 Flight – 2x Chinook HC5, HC6, HC6A
*No. 1312 Flight – at RAF Mount Pleasant – 1x Voyager KC2, 1x Atlas C1
*No. 1435 Flight – at RAF Mount Pleasant – 4x Typhoon FGR4

==Dormant Squadrons==
RAF College Cranwell stores some Standards for disbanded Squadrons that have the potential to be re-activated in the future, preserving the heritage of historic units. Once a Squadron Standard is &#x27;laid up&#x27; in a place of worship, upon the disbandment of the Squadron, that Standard can no longer be reactivated. Many UK churches have Standards from the RAF following a service of Disbandment. However, some Squadrons choose to lay up their Standards in College Hall at RAF Cranwell, the spiritual home of the RAF, and may be reactivated as active Squadrons in the future. Old disbanded squadrons that have laid up their Standards can be presented new Standards to reactivate them, but this is currently extremely rare.

Squadron Standards (and their last operated aircraft) that are on display in the College Hall Rotunda in order of seniority are:

==Other Squadrons==
The Royal Air force and Royal flying corps has always comprised a certain number of non-numbered Squadrons to fulfil special duties, experimental or one-off tasks.
===Communication Squadrons===

To allow rapid transport of Air Officers, staff and other important people many units and Headquarters operated communication Sections, Flights, Squadrons or wings.

=== Barrage Balloon Squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force ===

==Squadron codes==
Most units of the Royal Air Force are identified by alphabetical (or similar) characters, known as a &quot;squadron code&quot;, that is painted on all aircraft belonging to that unit. When individual units are assigned unusually large numbers of aircraft, multiple squadron codes have been used.

Other air forces, especially those from other Commonwealth countries, have often used similar systems of identification. During the Second World War, when units from other air forces were attached to the RAF – such as the Article XV squadrons (also known as &quot;400 series squadrons&quot;) – their squadron codes were often changed, to avoid confusion with RAF units.

Historically, the codes have usually been two letters of the alphabet, painted on the rear fuselage next to the RAF roundel. These formed a suffix or prefix to the call sign of each aircraft (on the other side of the roundel) which was usually a single letter (e. g. &quot;G for George&quot;). In general, when an aircraft is lost or withdrawn from use, its call sign has been applied to its replacement or another aircraft.

<text>Agence France-Presse (; AFP) is a French international news agency headquartered in Paris, France. Founded in 1835 as Havas, it is the world&#x27;s oldest news agency.

With 2,400 employees of 100 nationalities, AFP has an editorial presence in 260 cities across 150 countries. Its main regional headquarters are based in Nicosia, Montevideo, Hong Kong and Washington, D.C. AFP publishes stories, videos, photos and graphics in French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, and German. Two-thirds of its turnover comes from its own commercial activities, with the remaining one-third being provided by the French government (amounting to 113.3 million euros in 2022) as compensation for carrying out its mission of general interest.

In December 2024, AFP was ranked as the 27th most visited news site in the world, with over 105 million monthly readers.

==History==
Agence France-Presse has its origins in the Agence Havas, founded in 1835 in Paris by Charles-Louis Havas, making it the world&#x27;s oldest news service. The agency pioneered the collection and dissemination of news as a commodity, and had established itself as a fully global concern by the late 19th century. Two Havas employees, Paul Julius Reuter and Bernhard Wolff, set up their own news agencies in London and Berlin respectively.

In 1940, when German forces occupied France during World War II, the news agency was taken over by the authorities and renamed &quot;Office français d&#x27;information&quot; (French Information Office); only the private advertising company retained the name Havas. On 20 August 1944, as Allied forces moved on Paris, a group of journalists in the French Resistance seized the offices of the FIO and issued the first news dispatch from the liberated city under the name of Agence France-Presse.

Established as a state enterprise, AFP devoted the post-war years to developing its network of international correspondents. One of them was the first Western journalist to report the death of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin on 6 March 1953.
AFP was keen to shake off its semi-official status, and on 10 January 1957, the French Parliament passed a law establishing its independence. Since that date, the proportion of the agency&#x27;s revenues generated by subscriptions from government departments has steadily declined. Such subscriptions represented 115 million euros in 2011.

In 1982, the agency began to decentralize its editorial decision-making by setting up the first of its five autonomous regional centres, in Hong Kong, then a British dependent territory. Each region has its own budget, administrative director and chief editor. In September 2007, the AFP Foundation was launched to promote higher standards of journalism worldwide.

The Mitrokhin Archive identified six agents and two confidential KGB contacts inside Agence France-Presse who were used in Soviet operations in France.

In 1991, AFP set up a joint venture with Extel to create a financial news service, AFX News. It was sold in 2006 to Thomson Financial.

In October 2008, the Government of France announced moves to change AFP&#x27;s status, including the involvement of outside investors. On 27 November of that year, the main trade unions represented in the company&#x27;s home base of France – the CGT, Force Ouvrière, Syndicat national des journalistes, Union syndicale des journalistes CFDT and 
SUD, launched an online petition to oppose what they saw as an attempt to privatise the agency.

On 10 December 2009, the French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand announced that he was setting up a Committee of Experts under former AFP CEO Henri Pigeat to study plans for the agency&#x27;s future status. On 24 February 2010, Pierre Louette unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as CEO by the end of March, and move to a job with France Télécom.

In November 2013, AFP and Getty Images were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on Twitter related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter&#x27;s terms of service.

AFP&#x27;s statute was changed in 2015 to bring it into line with European legislation through Law No. 2015-433 of 17 April 2015.

The State&#x27;s financing of AFP was thus modified and was structured into two components: 
* Financial compensation for the Agency&#x27;s missions of general interest
* Commercial subscriptions from the State

The current CEO and chairman is Fabrice Fries and the Global News Director is Phil Chetwynd.

AFP returned to profitability in 2019 for the first time since 2013 and has consistently posted positive net results every year since. In 2023, the net profit reached 1.1 million euros. The debt, which stood at 50.2 million euros at the beginning of 2017, was reduced to 26.9 million euros by the end of 2023.

On 11 February 2025, Deputy News Director for Digital Strategy and Director of Communications Grégoire Lemarchand spoke at the AI in the City event at &quot;École normale supérieure&quot;, part of the AI Action Summit. Editorial Manager of the MediaLab Denis Teyssou participated in a roundtable discussion and Deputy News Director for Photo and Documentation Eric Baradat joined a panel discussion with representatives of Google, Microsoft and Imatag.

<doc id="471987" wikidata="Q500922" url="?curid=471987" title="Bet365 Stadium">
<text>The bet365 Stadium is an all-seater football stadium in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England and the home of EFL Championship club Stoke City. The stadium was previously called the Britannia Stadium but was renamed on 1 June 2016 when the club entered into a new stadium-naming-rights agreement with its parent company, Bet365. It has a capacity of 30,089 following the completion of expansion works in 2017.

The stadium was built in 1998 at a cost of £14.8 million as a replacement for the Victoria Ground. Former player Sir Stanley Matthews&#x27; ashes were buried beneath the centre circle of the pitch following his death in February 2000; he had officially opened the stadium on 30 August 1997. In European competitions it is known as the Stoke City Stadium due to UEFA regulations on sponsorships.

==History==

The all-seater stadium cost nearly £15 million to build and brought the club up to standards with the Taylor Report of January 1990 to end 115 years at the Victoria Ground. Along with the possibility of converting the Victoria Ground into an all-seater stadium, relocation was being considered by 1995 and by early 1996 the decision to build a new stadium elsewhere had been confirmed.

Construction of the stadium was underway during the 1996-97 season. In August 1997 it opened its doors for the first time as the Britannia Stadium thanks to a £1 million, 10-year sponsorship deal with the Britannia Building Society which was instrumental in the overall funding of the project. Another £4.5 million was given as a grant by the Football Trust.

The stadium&#x27;s opening did not go according to plan, as from the outset there was concern about getting there, as the plans covered only one access road from the nearby A50, and as a result, spectators arriving from the city or the motorway had to travel up the A50 for over a mile to a roundabout at Sideway and double-back the other way, which caused huge congestion. The stadium was officially opened by club legend Sir Stanley Matthews, then aged 82. After he died in March 2000, his ashes were buried beneath the stadium&#x27;s centre circle and a statue showing different stages of his career was put up in his honour outside the ground.

On 27 August 1997, Rochdale were the visitors for the historic first-ever competitive match – a 1–1 draw in the League Cup watched by 15,439 – and four days later the first-ever league game took place against Swindon Town before a crowd of 23,859. The first season at the new ground was a disappointing one as Stoke were relegated from the First Division, losing 5–2 at home to Manchester City on the final day of the season, with the visiting side also going down after the relegation-threatened sides above them all won their final games. The club&#x27;s supporters protested against chairman Peter Coates, who stood down afterwards, only to return in 2006.

Four seasons of third-tier football followed with Gunnar Gíslason taking control of the club in November 1999. In May 2006 he sold control of the club back to Peter Coates, and soon after the club obtained full ownership of the stadium in a deal worth £6 million following the previous joint-partnership with the Stoke-on-Trent City Council and Stoke-on-Trent Regeneration Ltd. The name of the ground was changed to the bet365 Stadium in June 2016.

==Structure and facilities==
In total, the stadium cost £14.7 million and took around ten months to construct on the former site of Stafford No.2 Colliery, which had been closed in 1969. Building work began in late autumn 1996 and was completed in August 1997. The all-seater stadium can hold 30,089 supporters in four cantilever stands. The main West stand consists of two tiers of seating which house 7,357 spectators, plus all of the stadiums corporate and media facilities. The Boothen and East stands hold 6,006 and 8,789 people respectively. The South Stand, which is used by both home and away supporters can hold 4,996 people. The club&#x27;s dressing rooms, offices, boardroom, ticket office and club store are positioned between the West and South stands.
In 2006, work took place on the A50 to allow direct access to the stadium from the eastbound direction, involving building a bridge across the road. It is close to the Sideway junction with the A500. At the start of the 2010–11 season, the stadium was accessible via a new underpass under Stanley Matthews Way, to reduce traffic problems with exiting the area back onto the A50.

==Development==
In the middle of 2009, surveyors were asked to investigate the feasibility of filling in one and possibly two of the stadium&#x27;s open corners. Filling in a corner of the ground would cost approximately £3 million, increasing capacity by around 3,000 seats and taking the total capacity to over 30,000. In November 2009, chairman Peter Coates said that a decision on expansion would be made at the end of the season and was dependent on the club&#x27;s Premier League survival.

In February 2010, the club were still considering whether to expand the 27,500 capacity by filling in the scoreboard corner between the South and East stands. Chief Executive Tony Scholes cautioned that expansion might jeopardise the atmosphere at the stadium, one of the factors credited with Stoke City&#x27;s resurgence in the top tier of English football, stating: &quot;The big risk when anyone expands their stadium is that they could lose that &#x27;sell-out&#x27; factor, which would affect the atmosphere. I would loathe to give that up.&quot; At the end of the 2009–10 season, Peter Coates indicated that the club would wait at least another 12 months before deciding whether to spend up to £6 million on expanding the stadium, saying: &quot;You don&#x27;t do these things lightly. It is on the drawing board and is something we will consider. But we want to feel confident we can justify it in terms of getting the increased capacity, filling it and it making economic sense.&quot;

Plans to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to over 30,000 were unveiled in November 2012. By June 2014 work had not started, and the club CEO, Tony Scholes, stated that the club were in no rush to expand the stadium. In April 2016 plans were again revealed for stadium expansion, with a stated completion to be in time for the beginning of the 2017–18 season, which was met. Work began on expanding the stadium to over 30,000 in February 2017 and was concluded in the summer of 2017.

Stoke began a £20 million five-year refurbishment project at the stadium beginning in the summer of 2022 including replacement seats, and upgrades to Delilah&#x27;s Bar (re-named Ricardo&#x27;s after Ricardo Fuller) and corporate boxes.

Ahead of the 2023–24 season, Stoke City undertook a floodlighting upgrade to state-of-the-art LED floodlights. With the floodlighting upgrade, the stadium also has the ability to put on light shows – which is now a standard occurrence at every evening game – it produces a stunning pre-match display that brings the bet365 to life in a whole new way

The away end was moved to the south-east corner ahead of the 2024–25 season with safe standing installed in the south stand. The club also opened a fan zone situated behind the Boothen End named the Boothen Quarter.

==Other events==
The stadium also has full conference, banqueting and events facilities and has, as well as football, also staged firework displays and music concerts. The likes of Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Busted, Elton John and Rod Stewart have all played out on the pitch at the ground in addition to the numerous summer music concerts.

The stadium hosted the 2002–03, 2003–04 and 2004–05 playoff finals for the Conference National and on 16 April 2002, it hosted England&#x27;s under-21s international friendly against Portugal&#x27;s under-21s. The hosts lost 1–0 with 28,000 in attendance. England U20s and 19s have also used the stadium.

<text>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, of Hindhead in the County of Surrey, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The viscountcy was created in 1946 for the military commander Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commemorating his crucial victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October–3 November 1942) (named after a minor railway halt marking the allied defence line), which sealed the fate of Rommel&#x27;s famed Afrika Korps.

As of 2022, the title is held by his grandson, Henry Montgomery, 3rd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, who succeeded in 2020. There are currently no heirs to the viscountcy as the 3rd Viscount has no sons and there are no other living male line descendants of the 1st Viscount. If the 3rd Viscount dies without male issue, the title will become extinct.

<doc id="472006" wikidata="Q1701992" url="?curid=472006" title="John V. Tunney">
<text>John Varick Tunney (June 26, 1934 – January 12, 2018) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator and Representative from the state of California in the 1960s and 1970s. A Democrat, Tunney was known for his focus on anti-trust and environmental legislation, especially the Noise Pollution Control Act of 1972 and the anti-trust Tunney Act. Tunney also strongly supported civil rights and shepherded the 1975 expansion of the Voting Rights Act.

He was the son of boxing champion Gene Tunney. A fellow Irish-American Catholic, Tunney was a roommate of Edward Kennedy at the University of Virginia School of Law, and became one of his best friends. Tunney won the 1970 United States Senate election in California, but was narrowly defeated for re-election in 1976 by Republican S. I. Hayakawa. After his loss, Tunney became an environmental activist.

==Early life and career==
Tunney was born on June 26, 1934 at Harkness Pavilion Medical Center in Manhattan, the second son of heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney and Polly Lauder Tunney, a member of the Lauder Greenway Family. He grew up on the family&#x27;s Star Meadow Farm in Stamford, Connecticut and attended New Canaan Country School and the Westminster School.

Tunney graduated from Yale University in 1956 with a degree in anthropology, where he was a member of the St. Anthony Hall fraternity. He attended The Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands and graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1959, where he was a roommate of future Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, who remained a close friend. Tunney was admitted to the Virginia and New York bars in 1959 and practiced law in New York City. He married his first wife, Mieke Sprengers, in 1959.

Tunney joined the United States Air Force as a judge advocate and served until he was discharged as a captain in April 1963. He taught business law at the University of California, Riverside in 1961 and 1962. In 1963, he was admitted to practice law in California. He was a special adviser to the President&#x27;s Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime from 1963 until 1968.

In 1964, Tunney was elected as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives from California&#x27;s 38th congressional district (Riverside and Imperial counties). He served from January 3, 1965, until his resignation on January 2, 1971, when he became a senator. Members of the Kennedy family such as Patricia Kennedy Lawford campaigned for Tunney, as did his father&#x27;s old rival Jack Dempsey. During his tenure in Congress, he voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 

In July 1969, while serving as a congressman, Tunney was called to Hyannisport, Massachusetts by Senator Kennedy, a friend and former college roommate, to assist in dealing with the death of Mary Jo Kopechne following the Chappaquiddick incident. Noting his &quot;service to the state,&quot; Tunney was made an honorary member of Phi Sigma Kappa by the fraternity&#x27;s Cal State Northridge chapter in 1970. 

==United States Senator==
In early 1970, Tunney announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate. His announcement was followed by that of fellow congressman George Brown, Jr. Their primary battle turned into one of the most bitter in California history. One of the key issues was the military draft. While Brown and Tunney both questioned expanding U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Brown opposed a continuation of the military draft while Tunney favored it. This conflict gave incumbent Republican George Murphy an early lead in the polls. Murphy&#x27;s staunch support for the Vietnam War hurt his campaign and as the general election approached, Tunney overtook him in the polls. The Murphy campaign suffered another setback when he underwent surgery for throat cancer, weakening his voice to a whisper. The Tunney campaign used his youthful appearance and high energy to contrast with the aging Murphy. His hairstyle and mannerisms drew comparisons to Robert F. Kennedy; New York Times praised Tunney for his &quot;Kennedyesque, prize-fighter glamour&quot; and &quot;Kennedy-like accent and mannerisms&quot;, calling him &quot;a swinger who wears his hair styled like a tight, furry helmet&quot;. Ultimately, Californians split their ticket in the 1970 midterm election, re-electing Republican governor Ronald Reagan and electing Democrat Tunney to the Senate.

In the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries, John Tunney, described by New York Times as one of the best friends of Edward Kennedy, endorsed Edmund Muskie. This endorsement was a part of a larger effort by Kennedy to aid Muskie - K. Dun Gifford, a former member of Kennedy&#x27;s Senate staff, agreed to join the Muskie organization in Massachusetts. Kennedy&#x27;s decision to support Muskie was considered surprising, as George McGovern was considered to be ideologically closer to Ted Kennedy&#x27;s views than Muskie. Media hinted that the vote of Kennedy could then be personal rather than ideological - Muskie was a Roman Catholic just like Kennedy and Tunney. The New York Times stated that &quot;Mr. Tunney&#x27;s endorsement is one of the most important Mr. Muskie has received since his Presidential campaign began&quot;; Tunney was also considered as a possible running mate for Muskie in the event of Muskie&#x27;s presidential nomination.

During his Senate term, Tunney produced a weekly radio report to California, in which he often interviewed other legislators. In 1974, he authored an antitrust bill known as the Tunney Act. Antitrust legislation was central to Tunney&#x27;s politics, along with his focus on environmental protection and civil rights - Tunney&#x27;s most important bills were the Noise Pollution Control Act of 1972, as well as the 1975 expansion of the landmark Voting Rights Act. Tunney would later write a book, &quot;The Changing Dream&quot;, about what he saw as a looming resource crisis.

In December 1975, Tunney advocated for using American diplomacy in dealing with the Angolan Civil War. American covert and military support for pro-US rebels there suggested a return to the policies that had led up toward the highly unpopular Vietnam War. The Senate had postponed passage of the annual defense budget because of concerns that the bill contained funds for covert operations against Soviet-backed Angolan rebels. The CIA conducted highly classified briefings for senators, including Tunney, providing an accounting of where money was being spent. However, they failed to persuade him of the policy&#x27;s usefulness. It was at this time that Tunney introduced an amendment that would cut $33 million from the defense budget that was to be allocated to pro-US rebels for covert operations. That effectively ended current and future covert funding from defense appropriations for Angola. Aid supporters filibustered the cutoff, offered counter-amendments and tried to shelve the amendment in committee.

The Ford administration, which strongly supported the covert operations, asserted that the amendment was a threat to both US-Soviet and US-Cuban relations. Cuba had deployed combat troops to Angola a month earlier. On December 20, 1975, Tunney&#x27;s amendment passed 54–22 with the support of 16 Republicans. Its passage also increased the power of the Congress in foreign affairs at the expense of the executive branch.

As a prominent Democratic politician in the populous and electorally pivotal state of California, Tunney was considered a potential &quot;national leader in the making&quot;, but &quot;instead he seemed mired in indecision about both the issues and his own future&quot;. Jeremy Larner, a former speechwriter often hired by Democratic politicians, provided a fictionalized story of John Tunney in the 1972 film The Candidate. In it, Tunney was portrayed as a well-intentioned but aimless young Democrat who was preyed upon by his domineering father. In real life, Tunney was accused of being unfaithful to his wife and underwent a divorce, which further complicated his 1976 re-election run. The film and divorce tarnished John Tunney&#x27;s image as a Kennedy-like figure, and made his 1970 electoral campaign backfire, given his image as a youthful, relaxed and aspiring politician - one ad showed him walking on the beach with a suit jacket slung over his shoulder. Tunney now faced accusations of being an adulterous divorcee and dating teenage girls. However, these claims were never substantiated, and friends and colleagues described Tunney&#x27;s &quot;playboy&quot; label as completely false.

Tunney was renominated for a second term in 1976 despite a high-profile challenge from his left in the form of Tom Hayden. Tunney was attacked by Hayden&#x27;s wife Jane Fonda, who accused Tunney of being a &quot;playboy dilettante who dates teenage girls&quot;. Hayden also criticized Tunney, mentioning his friendship with Edward Kennedy and calling Tunney &quot;a Chappaquiddick waiting to happen&quot; - a reference to the Chappaquiddick incident, which tarnished Kennedy&#x27;s reputation; Hayden later apologized for the accusation. That fall, Tunney was defeated in his reelection bid by Republican S. I. Hayakawa, the former president of San Francisco State University, who had never held elected office. Hayakawa ran as an outsider and highlighted Tunney&#x27;s numerous travels, missed Senate votes, and poor Senate attendance record during the campaign. He also painted Tunney as a flip-flopper.

Still, Tunney led in the polls right up to election night, despite a steadily shrinking lead as the campaign wore on. Despite Democrat Jimmy Carter&#x27;s victory in the presidential election, Tunney lost to Hayakawa in a mild upset, though Republican Gerald Ford carried California in the presidential election. Tunney resigned his Senate seat on January 1, 1977, two days before his term would officially expire, to allow Hayakawa to have seniority over other incoming senators.

Throughout Tunney&#x27;s term as a senator, he served as California&#x27;s junior senator and served with Alan Cranston.

After his 1976 Senate defeat, Tunney resumed practicing law and was a named partner at Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Tunney (1976–1987). He also served on several corporate boards.

==Interest in constitutional rights and government surveillance==
In early 1975, soon after becoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, Tunney asked the subcommittee staff to initiate a long-term comprehensive investigation into the technological aspects of surveillance. The Surveillance Technology Report of 1976 stated that &quot;This investigation of surveillance was the first attempt to organize an immense amount of data in a comprehensive and usable format and to provide a framework for future analyses and, ultimately, for the creation of institutional mechanisms that will diminish the threats posted by surveillance technology.&quot; In the preface of the report Tunney stated, &quot;If knowledge is power, then certainly the secret and unlimited acquisition of the most detailed knowledge about the most intimate aspects of a person&#x27;s thoughts and actions conveys extraordinary power over that person&#x27;s life and reputation to the snooper who possesses the highly personal information.&quot;

Tunney also served as chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Technology, and as a member of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee.

==Personal life==
Born in an Irish-American family, Tunney was a Roman Catholic. Originally, Tunney&#x27;s parents wanted him to become a priest, which was a common desire for immigrant Irish parents at the time.

On May 22, 1972, Tunney&#x27;s Dutch-born wife Mieke sued for dissolution of their 13-year marriage on the basis of irreconcilable differences. In addition to alimony, child support and half of the community property, she requested custody of the couple&#x27;s three children.

On April 23, 1977, Tunney married Kathinka Osborne, a member of the 1964 Swedish Olympic ski team, with longtime friend Senator Kennedy serving as the best man.

In February 2003, Tunney joined former Senate colleagues George McGovern and Fred Harris in opposing the Iraq War.

John and Kathinka Tunney lived primarily in Sun Valley, Idaho (with homes also in New York and Los Angeles). He was chairman of the board of the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Culture Center at UCLA and remained active in environmental causes. Tunney retired from the Hammer Museum board at the end of 2013. In February 2015, a pedestrian bridge at the museum designed by architect Michael Maltzan was named in Tunney&#x27;s honor.

Writer Jeremy Larner and director Michael Ritchie reportedly based the 1972 film &quot;The Candidate&quot;, starring Robert Redford, on Tunney&#x27;s successful Senate race in 1970.

Following his narrow defeat in 1976, Tunney largely stayed out of politics and committed himself to environmental causes, including serving on the board of Living with Wolves, an organization dedicated to raising consciousness of the animals’ importance.

In &quot;The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story&quot;, a 1986 NBC-TV movie based on Ted Kennedy Jr. losing one of his legs to cancer, Tunney was portrayed by Michael J. Shannon.

Tunney died of prostate cancer on January 12, 2018, in Brentwood, Los Angeles, at the age of 83.

==Works==

===The Riftwar Cycle===

The majority of Feist&#x27;s works are part of &quot;The Riftwar Cycle&quot;, and feature the worlds of Midkemia and Kelewan. Human magicians and other creatures on the two planets are able to create rifts through dimensionless space that can connect planets in different solar systems. The novels and short stories of The Riftwar Universe record the adventures of various people on these worlds.

&quot;Midkemia&quot; was originally created as an alternative to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game, by Feist and friends studying at the University of California San Diego. The group called themselves the &quot;Thursday Nighters&quot;, because they played the Midkemia role-playing game every Thursday evening. After some time, when the group changed and began meeting on Fridays, they became known as the &quot;Friday Nighters&quot;. The original group have since formed a company called Midkemia Press, which has continued publishing campaigns set in Midkemia.

Feist acknowledges that the Tekumel setting from M. A. R. Barker&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; was the source for much of the planet Kelewan. The original roleplaying campaign on which he based his books had an invasion of the Midkemia world by Tekumel. As a result, much of the background of Kelewan – the Tsurani Empire, the lack of metals and horses, the Cho&#x27;ja, the pantheons of 20 major and 20 minor gods – comes from Tekumel. Feist claims to have been unaware of this origin when he wrote &quot;Magician&quot;.

====The Firemane Saga====
Feist wrote a new trilogy titled &quot;Firemane&quot;, published in 2018–2022:
#&quot;King of Ashes&quot;, released in late April 2018.
#&quot;Queen of Storms&quot;, released in July 2020.
#&quot;Master of Furies&quot;, released in June 2022
The series was originally promoted as unconnected to the Riftwar Cycle but a connection was created with the author&#x27;s next series, begun in 2024.

====The Dragonwar Saga====
Feist began a new series, first projected as two books, then as a new trilogy, with the first title released in the UK and US in August 2024. This series sees the return of some main series characters, including a reincarnated Pug, as well as characters from the Firemane milieu.

===Other works===
Feist&#x27;s only novel fully outside the Riftwar universe was &quot;Faerie Tale&quot;, a fantasy story set in modern New York state. He has also published several short stories in various anthologies.

<text>Daily Me is a term that describes a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual&#x27;s tastes. This term was popularized by MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte. The term has also been associated with the phenomenon of individuals customizing and personalizing their news feeds, resulting in their being exposed only to content they are already inclined to agree with.

The Daily Me is a term popularized by MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte to describe a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual&#x27;s tastes. Negroponte discusses it in his 1995 book, &quot;Being Digital&quot;, referencing a project under way at the Media Lab, &quot;Fishwrap&quot;. Designed by Pascal Chesnais and Walter Bender and implemented by Media Lab students, the system allowed a greater deal of customization than commercially available systems in 1997.

Fred Hapgood, in a 1995 article in &quot;Wired&quot;, credited the concept and phrase to Negroponte&#x27;s thinking in the 1970s.

In Steven Johnson&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, which concerns emergent properties, Johnson addresses some of Negroponte&#x27;s fears with homeostasis and feedback systems in mind. He argues that a newspaper tailored to the tastes of a person on a given day will lead to too much positive feedback in that direction, and people&#x27;s choices for one day would permanently affect their viewings for the rest of their lives. Since the book&#x27;s release, in 2001, many customer-oriented websites, such as Amazon.com and Half.com, regularly utilize a customer&#x27;s past views and purchases to determine what merchandise they believe will entice the customer&#x27;s interest.

The term has also been associated with the phenomenon of individuals customizing and personalizing their news feeds, resulting in their being exposed only to content they are already inclined to agree with. The Daily Me can thus be a critical component of the &quot;echo chamber&quot; effect, defined in an article in &quot;Salon&quot; by David Weinberger as &quot;those Internet spaces where like-minded people listen only to those people who already agree with them.&quot;

Cass Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago, analyzes the implications of the Daily Me in his book &quot;Republic.com&quot;. Daily me and echo chambers have been suggested as one of the extremes of society induced by technology, the other being Tyranny of the majority.

Zite was a popular application that was similar to the Daily Me concept. It was available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. FeedSavvy.com is a similar service available on the web for PC and Mac users. is addressing this issue by letting the users explore subjects with a wider range in the results, avoiding the filter bubble effect.

<text>The Hunterian is a complex of museums located in and operated by the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland. It is the oldest museum in Scotland. It covers the Hunterian Museum, the Hunterian Art Gallery, the Mackintosh House, the Zoology Museum and the Anatomy Museum, which are all located in various buildings on the main campus of the university in the west end of Glasgow.

==History==

In 1783, William Hunter, a Scottish anatomist and physician who studied at the University of Glasgow, died in London. His will stipulated that his substantial and varied collections should be donated to the University of Glasgow. Hunter, writing to William Cullen, stated that they were &quot;to be well and carefully packed up and safely conveyed to Glasgow and delivered to the Principal and Faculty of the College of Glasgow to whom I give and bequeath the same to be kept and preserved by them and their successors for ever... in such sort, way, manner and form as ... shall seem most fit and most conducive to the improvement of the students of the said University of Glasgow.&quot;

As well as Hunter&#x27;s medical collections, which arose from his own work, Hunter collected widely, often assisted by his many royal and aristocratic patrons. He and his agents scoured Europe for coins, minerals, paintings and prints, ethnographic materials, books and manuscripts, as well as insects and other biological specimens. Hunter&#x27;s eclectic bequest forms the core of the collections, but have grown considerably, and now include some of the most important collections of work by artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and James McNeill Whistler, as well as superb geological, zoological, anatomical, archaeological, ethnographic and scientific instrument collections.

The museum first opened in 1807 in a specially constructed building off the High Street, adjoining the original campus of the university. For this, Hunter ensured funds for its building and design by architect William Stark through his three trustees: his nephew Matthew Baillie; his Scottish lawyer Robert Barclay of Capelrig House; and John Millar, cousin of William Cullen. When the university moved west to its new site at Gilmorehill (to escape crowding and pollution in the city centre), the museum moved too. In 1870, the Hunterian collections were transferred to the university&#x27;s present site and assigned halls in Sir George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s neo-Gothic building.

At first, the entire collection was housed together and displayed in the packed conditions common in museums of that time, but significant sections were later moved away to other parts of the university. The Zoological collections are now housed within the Graham Kerr Building, the art collections in The Hunterian Art Gallery, and Hunter&#x27;s library containing some 10,000 printed books and 650 manuscripts, finally received in 1807, in Glasgow University Library. Lady Shep-en-hor&#x27;s coffin and possible mummy were donated to the museum in 1820 by Joshua Heywood. The university&#x27;s Librarian Professor Lockhart Muirhead became the first Keeper of the Hunterian Museum in 1823. Hunter&#x27;s anatomical collections are housed in the Allen Thomson Building and his pathological preparations at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow.

==Notable Curators==

*Robert Arnot Staig c.1905 to c.1945
*William Smellie (geologist)
*John Young (1823–1900), from 1859
*John Young (professor of natural history) (1835–1902), from 1866 to 1902

==The museum and gallery&#x27;s current facilities==
===Hunterian Museum===

Housed in large halls in George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s University buildings on Gilmorehill, the museum features extensive displays relating to William Hunter and his collections, Roman Scotland (especially the Antonine Wall), geology, ethnography, ancient Egypt, scientific instruments, coins and medals, and much more.

The museum contains many donated collections, such as the Begg Collection of fossils donated by James Livingstone Begg in the 1940s.

The museum contains a high number of scientific instruments owned by or created by Lord Kelvin and other 19th century instrument makers.

In September 2016, the new Hunterian Collections and Study Centre, embracing the full range and activities of the museum and the art gallery, opened in the transformed Kelvin Hall in Phase 1 of a partnership with Glasgow City Council Glasgow Life and the National Library of Scotland. 

===Zoology Museum===
Most of the zoology collections, including those of William Hunter, are displayed in a separate museum within the Graham Kerr building, which also houses most of the university&#x27;s zoological research and teaching. This is also open to the general public. The insect collections are particularly important and extensive, and have been the subject of exhibitions of note in the 2010s.

===Hunterian Art Gallery===

The Gallery is now housed in a modern, custom-built facility that is part of the extensive Glasgow University Library complex, designed by William Whitfield. This displays the university&#x27;s extensive art collection, and features an outdoor sculpture garden. The bas relief aluminium doors to the Hunterian Gallery were designed by sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. The gallery&#x27;s collection includes a large number of the works of James McNeill Whistler and the majority of the watercolours of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

The Hunterian Art Gallery reopened in September 2012 after a refurbishment, with an exhibition dedicated to Rembrandt, &quot;Rembrandt and the Passion&quot;.

The gallery has held three major Mackintosh exhibitions: &quot;Architecture&quot; (2014), &quot;Travel Sketches&quot; (2015) and &quot;Unbuilt&quot; (2018), as well as two based on their Whistler collection &quot;Watercolours&quot; (2013) and &quot;Art and Legacy&quot; (2021).

===The Mackintosh House===

&quot;The Mackintosh House&quot; is a modern concrete building, part of the gallery-library complex. It stands on the site of one of two rows of terraced houses which were once sections of Hillhead Street and Southpark Avenue, demolished in the 1960s to make room for the university&#x27;s expansion across the residential crown of Gilmorehill. One of the buildings lost, 78 Southpark Avenue, was (between 1906 and 1914) the home of Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (although Mackintosh himself did not design it) and his wife, the artist, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh.

The university rebuilt the form of the house (using modern materials) approximately 100 metres from the site of the original. Due to its displacement, the former front door is now located in the façade of the gallery, some distance above the ground over Hillhead Street. &quot;The Mackintosh House&quot; comprises the principal interiors of the original house (including the dining room, studio-drawing room and bedroom), largely replicating the room layout of the old end-of-terrace building. It features the meticulously reassembled interiors from the Mackintoshes&#x27; home, including items of original furniture, fitments and decorations. The exhibits strikingly demonstrate Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#x27;s concept of the room as a work of art.

==Other Hunterian museums==
William Hunter&#x27;s brother John, a surgeon, also founded a museum; the London museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, also known as the Hunterian Museum, is based on his collection. The museum displays thousands of anatomical specimens, including the Evelyn tables and the skeleton of the &quot;Irish giant&quot; Charles Byrne, and many surgical instruments. It underwent a major refurbishment in 2003 and 2004, creating a new &quot;crystal&quot; gallery of steel and glass.

Both brothers were celebrated in the town of their birth, East Kilbride, at the small Hunter House Museum, later closed due to budget cuts.

<doc id="472016" wikidata="Q5551960" url="?curid=472016" title="Germanic mythology">
<text>Germanic mythology consists of the body of myths native to the Germanic peoples, including Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon mythology, and Continental Germanic mythology. It was a key element of Germanic paganism.

==Origins==
As the Germanic languages developed from Proto-Indo-European language, Germanic mythology is ultimately a development of Proto-Indo-European mythology. Archaeological remains, such as petroglyphs in Scandinavia, suggest continuity in Germanic mythology since at least the Nordic Bronze Age.

==Sources==
The earliest written sources on Germanic mythology include literature by Roman writers. This includes &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; by Julius Caesar, &quot;Geographica&quot; by Strabo, and &quot;Germania&quot; by Tacitus. Later Latin-language sources on Germanic mythology include &quot;Getica&quot; by Jordanes, &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; by Paul the Deacon, &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; by Bede, &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; by Rimbert, &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; by Adam of Bremen, and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus.

Vernacular sources on Germanic mythology include the Merseburg Charms, the Nibelungenlied, and various pieces of Old English literature, particularly &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The most important sources on Germanic mythology, however, are works of Old Norse literature, most of which were written down in the Icelandic Commonwealth during the Middle Ages; of particular importance is the Poetic Edda.

Archaeological evidence, Runic inscriptions and place-names are also useful sources on Germanic mythology.

==Mythology==
The myths of the Germanic peoples feature narratives focused on Germanic deities and a variety of other entities.

===Cosmology===
The beginning and end of the world is told in Völuspá, the first and best known poem in the Poetic Edda. The seeress in Völuspá tells of how the world began with a great magical nothingness called Ginnungagap, until Odin and his two brothers raised the Earth from the sea. They came across the tree trunks Ask and Embla, whom they created into the first human couple.

The accounts of Völuspá are contrasted with those in Vafþrúðnismál and Grímnismál. These say that Odin created the world from the body of the giant Ymir. Odin and his brothers were in turn descended from Búri, who had been created by the primeval cow Auðumbla. Parallels to Auðumbla are found in Indo-Iranian religion, testifying to the ancient Indo-European origins of Germanic mythology.

A central point in the Germanic cosmos is the tree Yggdrasil. Germanic mythology prophesises the end of the world in a coming Ragnarök.

===Deities===
A number of Germanic gods are mentioned in Old Norse literature and they are divided into the Æsir and the Vanir. The Æsir are primarily gods of war and dominate the latter, who are gods of fertility and wealth.

The chief god of the Æsir is Odin, a god associated with war, seiðr (witchcraft), and wisdom. He was probably worshipped primarily by kings and noblemen rather than the common people. Odin is the lord of Asgard, the abode of the gods, which includes the majestic hall Valhalla, where warriors who died a heroic death in battle (Einherjar) were admitted in order to prepare them to help Odin in the coming Ragnarök.

Odin&#x27;s wife was Frigg. His popular son, by the jǫtunn Jǫrð, was Thor, the god associated with thunder. Wielding his hammer Mjölnir, Thor engaged in conflict with the jötnar (giants) and the serpent Jörmungandr. Thor has many parallels in Indo-European mythology. He appears to have been worshiped extensively by the Germanic peoples, particularly warriors and the common people. A notable brother of Thor is Baldr. Other significant Æsir include the trickster god Loki; Heimdallr, who is reported in Rígsþula to have fathered the three classes of men; and Týr, a god associated with war and who lost his hand to the wolf Fenrir, who some scholars have proposed on linguistic evidence may have been a central deity in the Germanic pantheon in earlier times.

In Old Norse literature, the Æsir and Vanir are described as being in conflict. Through this conflict, certain Vanir gods, such as Njörðr, Freyja, and Freyr, join the Æsir. Similarities have been pointed out between Njörðr and Nerthus, a Germanic fertility god mentioned by Tacitus in &quot;Germania&quot; in the 1st-century AD. Sources also mention numerous other entities, such as Hel, who oversees an underworld location of the same name.

===Legendary creatures===
A number of legendary creatures appear in Germanic mythology, such as dísir, fylgjur, draugar, dwarfs, elves, as well as jötnar, goblins, giants, trolls and dragons.

==Legacy==
During the Middle Ages, Germanic peoples were converted to Christianity. The study of Germanic mythology has remained an important element of Germanic philology since the development of the field and the topic is an integral component of Heathenry, the modern revival of Germanic paganism. Elements of Germanic mythology have survived into modern Germanic folklore.

<text>Viscount Astor, of Hever Castle in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1917 for the financier and statesman William Waldorf Astor, 1st Baron Astor. He had already been created Baron Astor, of Hever Castle in the County of Kent, in 1916, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

His eldest son Waldorf, the second Viscount, was the husband of Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, the first woman to sit in the House of Commons. , the titles are held by their grandson, the fourth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1966. He is one of the ninety-two elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a Conservative.

John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever, was the third son of the first Viscount. This peerage, Baron Astor of Hever, was a separate creation in 1956 and not to be confused with the Viscount&#x27;s subsidiary title of Baron Astor, of Hever Castle in the County of Kent. The Hon. David Astor CH, the Hon. Michael Astor and the Hon. Sir Jakie Astor, younger sons of the second Viscount, all gained prominence in public life.

The family seat is Ginge Manor, near Wantage, Oxfordshire.

The first three Viscounts Astor are buried within the Astor family chapel (also known as the &quot;Octagon Temple&quot;) at the Cliveden estate near Taplow, Buckinghamshire.

<text>Xtra Vancouver (), formerly Xtra! West, was a gay bi-weekly newspaper, published by Pink Triangle Press in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Printed on newsprint in tabloid format from its establishment in 1993, Pink Triangle Press announced on January 14, 2015, that the paper edition will be discontinued and the publication will continue in an exclusively digital media format.

&quot;Xtra! West&quot; was founded in July 1993. Focused on business services, by the middle of 1995, it overtook &quot;Angles&quot;, the longer lasting community magazine of the LGBT community, to become Vancouver&#x27;s largest and most widely read publication targeting gay and lesbian community. The publication had a circulation of 20,000 copies reaching estimated 32,000 readers.

Its offices were located in the Davie Village neighbourhood, Vancouver&#x27;s gay village. The publication&#x27;s original editor and publisher was Daniel Gawthrop. He was succeeded as editor by Gareth Kirkby in 1996, and Kirkby was succeeded by Robin Perelle in 2005. In 2008, Brandon Matheson became publisher, succeeding Ken Hickling who was publisher from 1999.

In March 2010, &quot;Xtra! West&quot; was rebranded &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot; with the launch of a redesign in the Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver markets.

The publication&#x27;s final print edition was published on February 12, 2015.

<text>Xtra Ottawa (formerly &quot;Capital Xtra&quot;) was a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community newspaper published in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was launched in 1993. Unlike its biweekly sister publications &quot;Xtra&quot; in Toronto and &quot;Xtra Vancouver&quot; in Vancouver, &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; started as a monthly, and was later published 17 times a year, with a publication schedule of every three weeks. The Ottawa edition had a circulation of 20,000 copies which reached 36,000 readers.

Printed on newsprint in tabloid format from its establishment in 1993, Pink Triangle Press announced on January 14, 2015, that the paper edition would be discontinued and the publication would continue in an exclusively digital media format.

&quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; also published a gay tourism map, &quot;Out in Ottawa&quot;, every spring; the &quot;Ultimate Pride Guide&quot; in mid-July; and the &quot;Index&quot; gay business directory in December.

==History==
&quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; was launched by Pink Triangle Press as &quot;Capital Xtra&quot; in 1993, shortly after the organization learned that Ottawa&#x27;s existing LGBT publication, &quot;GO Info&quot;, had largely collapsed and was publishing irregularly with only a skeleton staff. Brandon Matheson, then a freelance journalist working in the Parliament Hill Press Gallery, was chosen to launch the project in conjunction with George Hartsgrove, then an administrator at the University of Ottawa. &quot;GO Info&quot; briefly tried to beef up its content in the face of its new competition, but folded in early 1994.

In 2007, Ottawa City Council attempted to pass restrictions on the paper&#x27;s distribution in public facilities after a complaint was filed by Greg Evans. 

In March 2010, &quot;Capital Xtra&quot; was renamed &quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; with the launch of a redesign of the Xtra papers in the Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver markets.

The paper&#x27;s final print edition was published on February 12, 2015.

==Contributors==
Early contributors to the magazine included Irshad Manji, Alex Munter, David Pepper, Andrew Griffin and Don McLean. Other contributors have included Glenn Crawford, Suki Lee, Blaine Marchand, Ariel Troster and Bradley Turcotte. Photographic contributors have included Pat Croteau, Eric Faure, Phillip Hannan, Shawn Scallen and Ben Welland.

==Community involvement==
&quot;Xtra Ottawa&quot; put on a series of events every year for the Ottawa queer community: the LGX business &amp; consumer expo each spring, the Transgress Festival as part of the Ottawa International Writer&#x27;s Festival each October, and the &quot;Capital Xtra!&quot; Community Achievement Awards ceremony to acknowledge local volunteers and activists.

<doc id="472040" wikidata="Q1474254" url="?curid=472040" title="Three Dog Night">
<text>Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, founded by vocalists Chuck Negron, Cory Wells, and Danny Hutton. This lineup was soon augmented by Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums). The band had 21 &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1975, with three hitting number one. Three Dog Night recorded many songs written by outside songwriters, and they helped to introduce mainstream audiences to writers such as Randy Newman (&quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;), Paul Williams (&quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song&quot;), Laura Nyro (&quot;Eli&#x27;s Comin&#x27;&quot;) and Hoyt Axton (&quot;Joy to the World&quot;, &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot;).

==Name origin==
The commentary included in the CD set &quot;Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965–1975&quot; states that vocalist Danny Hutton&#x27;s girlfriend, actress June Fairchild (best known as the &quot;Ajax Lady&quot; from the Cheech and Chong movie &quot;Up In Smoke&quot;) suggested the name after reading a magazine article about Aboriginal Australians, in which it was explained that on cold nights they would customarily sleep while embracing a dingo, a native species of wild dog. On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and, if the night were freezing, it was a &quot;three dog night&quot;.

Musician Van Dyke Parks, an arranger at Warner Bros. Records, disputed the above story and said he coined the name. On 10 September 2018, he wrote on Twitter, &quot;I wuz [&quot;sic&quot;] nuts about Hutton&#x27;s girlfriend. Quite a dancer. Yet, she didn&#x27;t read &quot;Mankind&quot; magazine, nor have an inkling of anthtopology [&quot;sic&quot;] and the cold aboriginal nights that inspired my suggestion.&quot;

==History==

===Background===

The three vocalists, Hutton (who got his start with Hanna-Barbera Records in 1964), Negron, and Wells (who landed a recording contract with Dunhill Records) first came together in 1967. They initially went by the name Redwood and made some recordings with Brian Wilson while the Beach Boys were working on the album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;.

Redwood was briefly poised to be one of the first artists signed to the Beach Boys&#x27; Brother Records. According to Beach Boy Mike Love, &quot;[Brian] had them in the studio for several days, and he was really funny. They didn&#x27;t meet up to his expectations. ... They&#x27;d go in and they wouldn&#x27;t sing well enough for him. ... but they went off and made billions.&quot; Wilson attempted to produce an album for Redwood, but after the recording of three songs, including &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; and &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, this motion was halted by his bandmates, who wanted Brian to focus on the Beach Boys&#x27; contractual obligations. According to Negron, due to the commercial failure of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and Wilson&#x27;s waning commitment to his band, &quot;the other Beach Boys wanted Brian&#x27;s immense songwriting and producing talents used strictly to enhance their own careers&quot;. Negron later noted that he would have acted similarly had he been in the same position as the Beach Boys.

Shortly after abandoning the Redwood moniker in 1968, the vocalists hired a group of backing musicians – Ron Morgan on guitar, Floyd Sneed on drums, Joe Schermie from the Cory Wells Blues Band on bass, and Jimmy Greenspoon on keyboards – and soon took the name Three Dog Night. Morgan left the band before its first album was recorded and subsequently joined the Electric Prunes. Michael Allsup was quickly recruited to replace Morgan on guitar.

=== 1968–1972 ===
Three Dog Night made its official debut in 1968 at the Whisky a Go Go, at a 5 p.m. press party hosted by Dunhill Records. They were still in the process of making their first album &quot;Three Dog Night&quot; when they heard the favorable reactions from the hypercritical audience.

The album &quot;Three Dog Night&quot; was a success with its hit songs &quot;Nobody&quot;, &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot;, and &quot;One&quot; and helped the band gain recognition and become one of the top-drawing concert acts of their time.

Between 1969 and 1972 they had 13 songs in a row reach the Top 10 on the Canadian RPM charts.

In December 1972, the band hosted and performed on the inaugural edition of Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve special &quot;New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve,&quot; &quot;Three Dog Night&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;, on NBC.

===1973–1979===
In 1973, Three Dog Night filed a $6 million lawsuit against their former booking agent, American Talent International (ATI), for continuing to advertise in the media that the band was still with their agency when in fact they signed with William Morris Agency in October 1972. Other damages were sought due to ATI taking deposits for booking Three Dog Night, whom they no longer represented.

Joe Schermie left in early 1973 due to &quot;problems arising that were apparently unresolvable&quot;. He was replaced by Jack Ryland shortly thereafter, and the band then became an eight-piece with the inclusion of former Blues Image member Skip Konte as a second keyboardist in late 1973. In late 1974, Allsup and Sneed left to form a new band, SS Fools, with Schermie and Bobby Kimball (later of Toto). New guitarist James &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith and drummer Mickey McMeel were recruited, but by 1975, Smith had been replaced by Al Ciner from Rufus and The American Breed, and Ryland by Rufus bassist Dennis Belfield. Mickey McMeel would go on to co-star as &quot;Turkey&quot;, the drummer of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs, in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;.

For the albums &quot;Cyan&quot;, &quot;Hard Labor&quot;, and &quot;Coming Down Your Way&quot;, Hutton was absent from many of the recording sessions due to burgeoning cocaine and alcohol abuse (often in conjunction with such friends as Harry Nilsson and Brian Wilson), eventually precipitating his dismissal from the band at the instigation of Wells in late 1975. He was replaced by Jay Gruska.

Hours before the first concert of their 1975 tour, Negron was arrested for the possession of narcotics but was soon released on $10,000 bond.

&quot;Coming Down Your Way&quot;, released in May 1975, failed to sell well in the United States, likely due to poor promotion on account of the band&#x27;s recently switched label, ABC, and the growing popularity of disco music. Disappointed by this, the band decided &quot;Til The World Ends&quot; would be the only single released from the album, which ended up being the group&#x27;s last &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 40 hit.

Jay Gruska toured with the band to promote their last album, &quot;American Pastime&quot;, released in March 1976. Still, the album did not sell well for the same reasons as before. However, the only single released off the album, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s a Masterpiece&quot; became an adult contemporary hit. Another former Rufus band member, Ron Stockert, was recruited as second keyboardist after Konte left in the first half of 1976. The group played their final show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976.

In 1979, NBC reported that the band&#x27;s accountant &quot;was shot in the arm and paralyzed, in what the police believe was a mob dispute over Three Dog Night.&quot; Joe Ulloa, a &quot;reputed mob enforcer from New York&quot;, was investigated as being involved.

===1981–1990s===
In 1981, Three Dog Night reunited, later releasing the ska-inspired &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle&quot; in 1983 on the small Passport Records label, which garnered some airplay on the new wave circuit. The EP failed to sell after Passport went bankrupt. The reunion featured all of the original members, except Joe Schermie, who was succeeded by future Rick Springfield bassist Mike Seifrit until 1982, and then by Richard Grossman, who was featured on &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle&quot; and stayed until 1984. Two guitarists, Paul Kingery and Steve Ezzo, occasionally played with the band, filling in for Allsup on dates he was not able to make between 1982 and 1984. Ezzo replaced Allsup when he departed in late 1984 to take care of some personal and family matters. Sneed was let go from the band at the same time. Also in late 1984, keyboardist David Bluefield filled in for Greenspoon, who was ill. But Bluefield was replaced in 1985 by Rick Seratte (formerly of Poco and later with Whitesnake and others) and the band hit the road with a revised lineup that included Seratte, Steve Ezzo, bassist Scott Manzo and drummer Mike Keeley. The band toured all through 1985, but Seratte left to pursue other offers and Greenspoon rejoined the band with Negron in late 1985 and were both back touring with the group.

By December 1985, after a relapse into his drug habit, Negron was let go, and the group continued with Wells and Hutton fronting the band and Paul Kingery was brought back on guitar to cover Chuck&#x27;s vocal harmonies. In 1986, their song &quot;In My Heart&quot; was featured in &quot;&quot;.

More changes in personnel occurred when guitarist T. J. Parker and vocalist and bassist Gary Moon replaced Kingery and Manzo in 1988, and were replaced themselves by Mike Cuneo and Richard Campbell during 1989.

Allsup returned to the group to replace Cuneo in the spring of 1991. Negron entered drug rehab, but did not return to the band.

Pat Bautz succeeded Keeley as drummer in 1993.

In 1993, Three Dog Night performed for The Family Channel show &quot;Spotlight on Country&quot;, filmed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Kingery returned to the band as their bass player in 1996 following Campbell&#x27;s departure.

Jack Ryland (born November 15, 1950), bassist from 1973–1975, died November 13, 1996, two days before his 46th birthday.

===2000–2012===
Original bassist Joe Schermie died on March 26, 2002. In May 2002 the band released &quot;Three Dog Night with The London Symphony Orchestra&quot;. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and in London at Abbey Road Studios and includes two new songs: &quot;Overground&quot; and &quot;Sault Ste. Marie&quot;. They also released a DVD of a filmed symphony performance from 2000 titled &quot;Three Dog Night Live With the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra&quot; in May 2002. In the summer of 2004, 80s bassist Scott Manzo returned briefly to fill in for Paul Kingery.

In October 2004, Three Dog Night released &quot;The 35th Anniversary Hits Collection Featuring The London Symphony Orchestra&quot;. The album includes live versions of &quot;Eli&#x27;s Coming&quot;, &quot;Brickyard Blues&quot;, &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, and &quot;Family of Man&quot;. In August 2008, they released &quot;Three Dog Night Greatest Hits Live&quot;, a compilation of previously unissued live recordings from concerts in Frankfurt, Germany and Edmonton, London in 1972 and 1973. On October 24, 2009, they released three new songs: &quot;Heart of Blues&quot;, &quot;Prayer of the Children&quot;, and &quot;Two Lights In The Nighttime&quot;. They issued two new songs on their &quot;35th Anniversary Hits Collection Featuring The London Symphony Orchestra&quot;.

===2012–present===
In the summer of 2012, guitarist Allsup was hospitalized for an intestinal disorder, forcing Kingery to move back to guitar, while Danny&#x27;s son Timothy Hutton played bass. This happened again during the summer of 2015 when Allsup was forced to miss some shows. On March 11, 2015, Jimmy Greenspoon died from cancer, aged 67. His place at the keyboards was taken by Eddie Reasoner who had substituted for him when he took ill in mid-2014.

On October 21, 2015, Cory Wells died at his home in Dunkirk, New York, at age 74. In November 2015, the band announced that singer David Morgan would be joining them on the road. He was a former member of The Association. In April 2017, Howard Laravea replaced Eddie Reasoner on keyboards. He was formerly with Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.

When Three Dog Night returned to touring in August 2021, it was without Michael Allsup, who was replaced with Tim Hutton on bass. Paul Kingery switched back to guitar. Allsup is still a member of Three Dog Night, but is now retired from touring. Danny Hutton has stated during concert appearances that Three Dog Night has been recording a new album, before performing their new song &quot;Prayer of the Children&quot;.

<doc id="472043" wikidata="Q688660" url="?curid=472043" title="Darién Province">
<text>Darién (, ; ) is a province in Panama whose capital city is La Palma. With an area of , it is located at the eastern end of the country and bordered to the north by the province of Panamá and the region of Kuna Yala. To the south, it is bordered by the Pacific Ocean and Colombia. To the east, it borders Colombia; to the west, it borders the Pacific Ocean and the province of Panama.

The area surrounding the border with Colombia is known as the Darién Gap, a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest. With no roads, it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway.

==Place names==
The name originates from the language spoken by the Cueva, an Indigenous tribe destroyed by the European conquistadors during the 16th century. The Tanela River, which flows toward Atrato, was Hispanicized to Darién; the region and its communities took the same name. Santa María la Antigua del Darién, the first city founded in Tierra Firme, also took its name from the river. Subsequently, the region&#x27;s boundaries were defined by the Gulf of Urabá.

==History==
Darién Province has been inhabited by indigenous people for thousands of years. Evidence based on soil erosion suggests slash-and-burn agriculture at the latest 4000 years ago. Disappearance of paleobotanical evidence of this culture coincides with the arrival of European colonists, which likely decimated this population.

In 1508, the Spanish Crown decided to colonize the mainland, the chosen area extending from Cabo Gracias a Dios in western Central America (in the present boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras) to Cabo de la Vela, Venezuela in the east. The provinces on the mainland were Nueva Andalucía, between the Atrato River in the Gulf of Uraba and the Cabo de la Vela in Venezuela and Castilla del Oro (or Veragua), which stretched from the Atrato River to Cabo Gracias a Dios in Central America.

The Governor of Nueva Andalucía was Alonso de Ojeda and the mayor of Castilla del Oro was Diego de Nicuesa, who became the first governor of the Isthmus of Panama. Diego de Nicuesa founded Nombre de Dios in 1510. Martín Fernández de Enciso founded Santa Maria la Antigua del Darién, west of the Gulf of Urabá, in September 1510 on the advice of Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who had arrived at those lands earlier with Rodrigo de Bastidas.

On September 1, 1513, Balboa went in search of the South Sea with 190 Spaniards and 1,000 Indigenous people. He sighted the sea on September 25, 1513, and claimed it for the Spanish Crown on September 29 in the Gulf of San Miguel.

During the late 17th century there was a Scottish colonization project in the Isthmus of Panama (specifically in Darién), from which William Paterson emerged as the center of the unsuccessful attempt. The attempt to colonize by the Company of Scotland, which traded with Africa and the Indies, was part of the conflict between Spain and other 16th-century European powers in reaction to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas.

On July 14, 1698 Paterson left with an expedition of about 1,200 on five ships (&quot;Saint Andrew&quot;, &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;) from Leith, Scotland. The expedition landed October 30, 1698 in Anachucuna, a sandy bay in the north of Darien near Golden Island. It forged a &quot;treaty of alliance and friendship&quot; with an Indigenous leader, and founded in Acla a colony known as New Caledonia.

Paterson and his expedition withstood a Spanish force which attempted to confront them. However, diseases related to the climate and unsanitary conditions soon decimated the expedition. In June 1699 the Scots were forced to leave New Caledonia, despite protests from Paterson, and retreated to Jamaica.

A second expedition left Scotland on September 24, 1699 from Rothesay on the Firth of Clyde with four ships: the &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Hope of Boroughstonness&quot; and &quot;Company&#x27;s Hope&quot;. Paterson had a total crew of 1,300 men. On November 30, 1699 they arrived safely at the port of Caledonia, but met greater resistance from Spanish forces; they were besieged, outnumbered and without external support. On March 28, 1700, they requested that the Spanish commander set conditions for surrender.

==Government and politics==
The Constitution of Panama of 1972, amended by the Reform Acts of 1978 and the Constitutional Act of 1983, has a unitary, republican, democratic and representative government. Three branches of government exist in all provinces of the Republic of Panama.

==Administrative divisions==
Darién Province is divided into three districts and 26 &quot;corregimientos&quot;.

The &quot;comarca indígena&quot; of Kuna de Wargandí, established in 2000, lies within Pinogana District and constitutes a separate &quot;corregimiento&quot;.

===Other subdivisions formerly part of Darién===
The &quot;comarca indígena&quot; (indigenous territory) of Emberá-Wounaan was established from the province on November 8, 1983. It consists of two districts:

* Cémaco
* Sambú

==Geography==
Darién Province covers an area of , comparable to the island of Jamaica. It is the largest province by area, but also the smallest in population. In the centre is an undulating plain, fed by the rivers Chucunaque and Tuira and framed by steep areas of the highlands of San Blas, Bagre, Pirre, and the Saltos. Among the highest mountains in the province are Tacarcuna at , Piña at , Pirre at , Nique at , Chucantí at , Tanela at and Upper Quia at .

Eight percent of the province&#x27;s land is suitable for intensive cultivation, 60 percent is suitable for pasture, permanent crops and forestry production and 25 percent is protected forest reserves. The dominant natural vegetation is forests which, according to the topographic elevation and rainfall patterns, are classified as tropical moist, subtropical moist and cloud forest.

==Climate==
Rainfall reaches near the inlet of Garachiné, with a marked dry period between January and April (a tropical savanna climate, &quot;Aw&quot; on the Köppen climate classification). However, in the foothills and valleys of the province&#x27;s interior precipitation can exceed per year with virtually no dry season (a tropical rainforest climate, Köppen &quot;Af&quot;); this ranks the area among the rainiest regions on earth. The temperature varies, by altitude, between . The soil types and their suitability for use are primarily associated with topographic variations and geological-material generators.

==Hydrology==
In Darién Province watersheds form extensive sedimentary waterways, pouring their waters into rivers such as the Rio Chucunaque and the 230-km Tuira (the longest, most treacherous rivers in Panama). The hydrographic system in the province shows a minimum flow in March and April and a maximum in November.

The use of water resources is largely limited to the provision of potable water to 15 towns. The lack of detailed information on topography and hydrometeorology makes it difficult to estimate hydropower potential, but possible candidates are the Pirre, Antad, Tuira, Chico and Yape Rivers.

==Demographics==
The province&#x27;s population is small, dispersed and heterogeneous, located in small towns linked to waterways. Significant migration flows to and from the province have been recorded.

In 1970 the population totaled 22,685, primarily mulattoes, black people, indigenous Colombian Chocoanos and settlers from other areas of Panama. Approximately 60 percent of the population is located in 523 towns of less than 500 inhabitants each.

In 2000 the Census of Population and Housing indicated that the May population of Darién was 40,284 inhabitants living in 11,514 dwellings in 613 towns.

Preliminary data from the XI National Census of Population and Housing VI show that as of May 16, 2010 Darién has a population of 46,951 inhabitants, of which 25,764 are men and 21,187 women. There were a total of 15,310 homes. At the 2023 census 54,235 people were counted.

==Culture==
The population is primarily indigenous, Afro-Descendants, and settlers who migrated from other provinces (mainly Santeña, Herrerano and Veraguas) in search of land and opportunity.

The characteristic music of the people of Darién is the &quot;bullerengue&quot;, a drum dance from Africa.

Groups who have migrated to the province are trying to preserve their customs and traditions which are distinct from Colombian culture.

Radio stations play &quot;bullerengue&quot;; stations nearer the Colombian border favor &quot;vallenato&quot; music.

Common foods include &quot;guacho de mariscos&quot; (fish with coconut rice) and &quot;serendengue&quot;. &quot;Choca&#x27;o&quot; (stewed plantain) is a traditional drink.

Women usually wear hand-sewn dresses, while men dress for business. Primary crops grown in the province are maize, rice, plantains, bananas, cassava, yams and beans. In the Gulf of San Miguel shrimp, fish and lobster are abundant; a fishing fleet operates from Panama City. In the inland rivers of the province, fishing is mainly for sustenance. The lumber industry yields valuable woods such as cedar, balsa, balsam, mahogany and cocobolo.

==Videos==
* Tierra Adentro (Inland) a film documentary by Mauro Colombo. At the dangerous border between these two countries, guerrillas, immigrants, indigenous people, farmers, drug traffickers, local police, and wild animals cross paths. (presented at Rotterdam international Film Festival in 2019).

<text>The Tuira River is located in the Darién Province of eastern Panama. It flows into the Bay of San Miguel at the province capital of La Palma.

It is the largest river in Panama, and one of its tributaries, the Chucunaque River, is the longest river in Panama.

The river starts in highlands of Darien, and runs south/southeast, and then north and west. It runs past villages as it flows downstream including Matuganti, Sobiaquirú, El Balsal, Boca de Cupe, Capetí, Yape, Aruza, Unión Chocó, Vista Alegre, and Pinogana. It meets the Chucunaque River at El Real de Santa María and then flows northwest towards La Palma. Via the Chucunaque, one can reach Yaviza, which is the terminus of the northern end of the Pan-American Highway. 

The Paya River joins the river downstream of Sobiaquirú, via which the village of Paya can be reached. The Púcuro River joins downstream of the Paya, via which the village of Púcuro can be reached.

<text>Quassin is a white, bitter, crystalline substance that is the prototypical example of the family of quassinoids. It can be extracted from the quassia tree, from which it gets its name. It was first isolated in 1937, and its chemical structure was elucidated in 1961. 

It is one of the most bitter substances found in nature, with a bitter threshold of 0.08 ppm and it is 50 times more bitter than quinine.

Extracts of the bitterwood tree (&quot;Quassia amara&quot;) containing quassin are used as additives in soft drinks.

Although its skeleton possesses 20 carbon atoms, quassin is not a diterpene but rather a triterpene lactone, which derives from euphol by loss of 10 carbon atoms including C4.

<text>Gigha ( ; ; ) or the Isle of Gigha (and formerly Gigha Island) is an island off the west coast of Kintyre in Scotland. The island forms part of Argyll and Bute and has a population of 163 people. The climate is mild with higher than average sunshine hours and the soils are fertile. The main settlement is Ardminish.

Gigha has been inhabited continuously since prehistoric times. It may have had an important role during the Kingdom of Dalriada and is the ancestral home of Clan MacNeill. It fell under the control of the Norse and the Lords of the Isles before becoming incorporated into modern Scotland and saw a variety of conflicts during the medieval period.

The population of Gigha peaked at over 700 in the eighteenth century, but during the 20th century the island had numerous owners, which caused various problems in developing the island. By the beginning of the 21st century the population had fallen to 98. However a &quot;community buy-out&quot; in 2002 has transformed the island, which now has a growing population and a variety of new commercial activities to complement farming and tourism.

Attractions on the island include Achamore Gardens and the abundant wildlife, especially seabirds. There have been numerous shipwrecks on the surrounding rocks and skerries.

In 2021 the U.K. television broadcaster Channel 4 produced a reality show called Murder Island on the island, featuring a fictitious murder case written by the Scottish author Ian Rankin and “investigated” by ordinary members of the public, assisted by former police officers.

== Etymology ==
The Hebrides have been occupied by the speakers of at least four languages since the Iron Age, and many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning as a result. 
Many modern authorities hold that the name &quot;Gigha&quot; is probably derived either from the Norse &quot;Guðey&quot; or from &quot;Gud-øy&quot;, meaning either &quot;good island&quot; or &quot;God island&quot;. The Norse historical text &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot; explicitly calls the island &quot;Guðey&quot;.

Despite this, Keay and Keay (1994) and Haswell-Smith (2004) suggest the Gaelic name is derived instead from &quot;Gjáey&quot;, meaning &quot;island of the geo&quot; or &quot;cleft&quot;. However, Norse &quot;gjá&quot; normally shows up in Gaelic in the form of &quot;geodha&quot;. Czerkawaska (2006) also notes that the isle is called &quot;Gug&quot; in a charter of 1309 and also appears as &quot;Gega&quot; on some old maps and speculates that a possible pre-Norse derivation is from the Gaelic &quot;Sheela na Gig&quot;, a female fertility symbol. Haswell-Smith (2004) also offers the possibility of &quot;Gydha&#x27;s isle&quot; after the Norse female name.

A Gigha resident is a &quot;Gioghach&quot;, also nicknamed a &quot;gamhainn&quot; (&quot;stirk&quot;). Although the most widespread pronunciation of the Gaelic name &quot;Giogha&quot; is , the Southern dialects preserve the fricative: in Kintyre and in Argyllshire.

== Geology ==
The bedrock of Gigha is largely amphibolite, a meta-igneous rock which was probably, before its metamorphism, one or more sills. Some areas, particularly along the east coast are formed from the Erins Quartzite, a metasedimentary rock of Neoproterozoic age (late Precambrian) which falls within the Crinan Subgroup of the Argyll Group, itself a part of the Dalradian sequence which forms most of the southern Highlands. This rock sequence also include pelites and semipelites. The amphibolite is cut by numerous broadly southeast–northwest aligned dykes of olivine-microgabbro dating from the Palaeogene period and forming a part of the ‘North Britain Palaeogene Dyke Suite’.
Raised marine deposits cover parts of the island, a product of higher relative sea levels during the early Holocene.

== Geography ==

Gigha lies off the coast of Kintyre and is long in a roughly north–south direction and a maximum of wide. The total area is and the highest elevation of Creag Bhàn reaches only . The rocky central spine is composed of epidiorite with basalt intrusions.

The main settlement is Ardminish which is on the south east coast and offers a small anchorage in the sheltered Ardminish Bay. Further to the north is Druimyeon Bay and beyond that West and East Tarbert Bays which (as their names imply) lie astride a small isthmus. There are various farms and associated buildings located throughout the island including Kinerarach and Tarbert in the north Ardailly in the west, where there are two holiday homes and a ruined watermill and North and South Druimachro on the east coast south of Ardmininsh.

The climate is mild with higher than average sunshine hours and minimum temperatures, and lower than average days of ground frost for Scotland. Annual rainfall is typically between .

=== Surrounding islands ===
Cara Island lies just offshore to the south, the smaller Craro Island lies to the west and Gigalum Island to the south east. A sandy spit connects Gigha to Eilean Garbh in the north-west. To the north are the rocks called An Dubh Sgeir (a common name meaning &quot;black rock&quot;) and Gamhna Giogha. The Sound of Gigha separates Gigha and its attendant isles from mainland Kintyre.

To the west and north west respectively, are the two large islands of Islay and Jura. South west are Rathlin Island and the north of Ireland, which can be seen from Gigha on clear days. Between Jura and Gigha are the rocks of Na Cuiltean and Skervuile Lighthouse. Between Gigha and Port Ellen on Islay is the island of Texa. Eilean Mòr and Island of Danna are little further up the Argyll coast to the north.

There are also many small rocks and skerries (small rock islands) in the seas around Gigha. Asked by a tourist if he knew where they all were, local resident Willie McSporran (see below) replied &quot;No, but I know where they aren&#x27;t and that&#x27;s good enough for me&quot;.

== History ==
Gigha has been inhabited continuously since prehistoric times, and there are several standing stones on the island. There are many other archaeological sites, including cairns, duns and an ogham stone near to Kilchattan, which has not been deciphered.

In the Early Historic Period The domain of the Cenél nGabraín appears to have been centred on Kintyre and Knapdale and may have included Arran, Jura and Gigha. The title king of Kintyre is used of a number of presumed kings of the Cenél nGabrain. This would have made Gigha part of Dalriada.

There is some evidence to show that the island might have been the seat of power for Conall mac Comgall, King of Dalriada, in the mid to late 6th century. The Annals of Tigernach refer to a Battle of Delgon (later Cindeglen) in 574, and this has been identified as taking place on Gigha, then referred to as &quot;Eilean da Ghallagan&quot;, although other sources believe the battle took place in Kintyre.

=== Norse period ===

Nearby Islay was a centre for Norse control over the Hebrides, and Gigha was later part of the Kingdom of the Isles. The island&#x27;s name appears to be Norse in origin, although its meaning is disputed, and there are several other Norse placenames in the vicinity, such as Gigalum (i.e. &quot;Gigha - holm&quot;) and Cnoc Haco (possibly &quot;Haakon&#x27;s hill&quot;).

In 1849, a Viking grave was found at East Tarbert Bay, which revealed a number of artefacts, including a bronze weighing balance dated to the 10th century.

Prior to the Battle of Largs, Haakon IV of Norway is said to have visited the island. According to &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot; (&quot;The Saga of Haakon Haakonsson&quot;) written by Icelander Sturla Þórðarson in the 1260s:
:&quot;King Haco sailed afterwards south to Guðey before Kintyre where he anchored. There King John met him; he came in the ship with Bishop Thorgil. King Haco desired him to follow his banner as he should do. But King John excused himself. He said he had sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands than of the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that John King of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, had turned to the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.

:&quot;During King Haco&#x27;s stay at Guðey an Abbot of a monastery of Greyfriars waited on him, begging protection for their dwelling, and Holy Church: and this the King granted them in writing.&quot;

:&quot;Friar Simon had lain sick for some time. He died at Guðey. His corpse was afterwards carried up to Kintire where the Greyfriars interred him in their Church. They spread a fringed pall over his grave, and called him a Saint.&quot;
=== John of Islay ===
After Edward Balliol&#x27;s coup against the Bruce regime in 1333, he attempted to court John of Islay, Lord of the Isles. In 1336, Edward confirmed the territories which the Islay lords had acquired in the days of Robert I and awarded John the lands of Kintyre, Knapdale, Gigha, Colonsay, Mull, Skye, Lewis, and Morvern, previously held by magnates still loyal to the Bruces. John, however, never provided Edward with real assistance. Although Balliol&#x27;s deposition and the restoration of the House of Bruce meant that the grants made to John were void, his pre-1336 possessions were confirmed by King David II in 1343. Moreover, in 1346, John inherited the great Lordship of Garmoran through his brother-in-law Raghnall MacRuaridh. This meant that John&#x27;s dominions now included all of the Hebrides except Skye, and all of the western seaboard from Morvern to Loch Hourn.

=== Clan MacNeill ===

Gigha is the ancestral home of the Clan MacNeill, which possesses its own tartan and Clan badge, both distinctly different from those of the larger and better known Clan MacNeil of Barra (spelt with one &quot;l&quot; in English) who share the same Chief.

The origin of the MacNeills of Taynish, Gigha and Colonsay is obscure. They were hereditary keepers of Castle Sween under the Lords of the Isles during the 15th and 16th centuries. The MacNeill of Gigha, was known as the &quot;chief and principal of the clan and surname of Macneils&quot; in 1530. However, as the power of the Campbells grew and spread into the Inner Hebrides, the influence of the MacNeills of Gigha decreased. At about this time the MacNeils on the more remote island of Barra, far removed from Campbell power, began to grow in prominence and for a long time since have been regarded as &quot;Chief of the Clan and Name&quot;.

In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted part of the island to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the remainder being owned by the monks of Paisley. In 1493 the whole island came under MacNeill control and it remained in their hands, with various brief interludes, until the 19th century. This prize was by no means without its hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.

=== Medieval conflict ===
In 1554 the MacNeills relinquished their Gigha holdings to the MacDonalds, but if anything the conflicts intensified. In 1567 Gigha was &quot;ravaged&quot; by the Macleans of Duart. By 1587, atrocities committed between warring West Highland clans had escalated to such an extent that Parliament devised what is known as the &quot;General Band&quot; in an effort to quell hostilities. Despite the Governments actions to secure the peace, about this time Lachlan Mor MacLean of Duart ravaged the MacDonald islands of Islay and Gigha, slaughtering 500—600 men. Maclean of Duart then besieged Angus MacDonald of Dunivaig and the Glens at his Castle Dunivaig on Islay.

The siege was only lifted when MacDonald of Dunivaig agreed with MacLean of Duart to surrender half of his lands on Islay. However, despite his agreement with the MacLeans, MacDonald of Dunivaig then invaded the MacLean islands of Mull, Tiree, Coll and Luing. Angus MacDonald of Dunivaig was aided in the action by Donald Gorm Mor MacDonald of Sleat and the MacDonalds of Clanranald, MacIains of Ardnamurchan, MacLeods of Lewis, MacNeills of Gigha, MacAlisters of Loup and the Macfies of Colonsay. Supporting MacLean of Duart were the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, MacNeils of Barra, MacKinnons of Strathrodle and the MacQuarries of Ulva.

In 1590, Angus of Islay sold out to John Campbell of Cawdor, a junior cousin of the Earl of Argyll. In a move that may well have been pre-arranged Campbell then immediately resold back to Neil MacNeill of Taynish. The church at Kilchattan that dates from this period has some &quot;intricately carved medieval grave slabs&quot;.

=== 17th century ===
Visiting in the late 17th century Martin Martin wrote:
This isle is for the most part arable, but rocky in other parts; the mould is brown and clayey, inclining to red; it is good for pasturage and cultivation. The corn growing here is oats and barley. The cattle bred here are cows, horses, and sheep. There is a church in this island called Kilchattan, it has an altar in the east end, and upon it a font of stone which is very large, and hath a small hole in the middle which goes quite through it. There are several tombstones in and about this church; the family of the Macneils, the principal possessors of this isle, are buried under the tombstones on the east side the church, where there is a plot of ground set apart for them. Most of all the tombs have a two-handed sword engraven on them, and there is one that has the representation of a man upon it... This isle affords no wood of any kind, but a few bushes of juniper on the little hills.
William II of Scotland visited the island in 1689, the MacNeill remaining loyal to the crown both then and in the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.

=== Modern period ===

In the 18th century the population of Gigha peaked at over 600, but it had declined to just under 400 by the close of the 19th century. After half a millennium of association, the MacNeills sold the island for £49,000 to James Williams Scarlett, a nephew of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger in 1865. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel William James Scarlett, built the mansion house of Achamore and Gigha remained in the family&#x27;s hands until 1919.

During the 20th century the island had various other owners. Major John Allen bought the island from the Scarletts and sold it to Richard Hamer in 1937, before passing ownership during World War II to his brother-in-law, Somerset de Chair, who in turn sold to Sir James Horlick in 1944. Horlick is recalled as a generous owner who encouraged dairy farming and created the gardens of Achamore. David Landale then purchased it from the Horlick estate in 1973 and retained it until 1989. Meanwhile he had created a fish farm at South Druimachro, which now specialises in halibut and has a growing international reputation. Over the years little further development took place, and some owners are recalled less fondly. The island briefly passed into the hands of Malcolm Potier, a property developer, and subsequently to Derek Holt and his family prior to the sale to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust. By the 1960s resident numbers had fallen to 163; and by the beginning of the 21st century the population was reduced to only 98 and the housing stock was in poor condition.


Note: The figures for 1755–1841 include Cara.

== Community buy-out ==
The challenges created by private landlords came to an end in March 2002 when the islanders managed, with help from grants and loans from the National Lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, to purchase the island for £4 million. They now own it through a development trust called the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust. As a result, 15 March, the day when the purchase went through, is celebrated as the island&#x27;s &quot;independence day&quot;. £1 million of the financial support was in the form of a short-term loan. The money to pay this loan back was largely raised by selling Achamore House (but not the gardens) to Don Dennis, a businessman from California. Dennis now operates a flower essences importing business and a boat tours company from the house, which is also rented out as a bed and breakfast business. 

An additional £200,000 was raised by the islanders through various fundraising ventures, allowing the loan to be paid back to the Scottish Land Fund on 15 March 2004. Since the community buyout, several other private businesses have sprung up on Gigha, providing a boost to the local economy. The island&#x27;s population and economy have begun to recover as a result of these activities.

== Economy ==

Gigha&#x27;s economy is largely dependent on livestock farming, tourism and some limited fishing. There have been some moves to diversify the economy since the community buy-out. There is also a fish farm on the island.

 of arable land are farmed and relative to its size it is the most fertile and productive island in Scotland. Ayrshire cattle are kept on the island.

In October 2006 it was announced that the population had reached 150 – a rise of more than 50 per cent since the 2002 buy-out. Willie McSporran, former chairman of the Heritage Trust, was quoted as saying: &quot;The trust turned 300 years of population decline on its head by encouraging new development and the growth of the local economy. A sign of the surge of people wanting to relocate to Gigha is that we are struggling to meet the demand for housing despite building 18 new homes.&quot; The issues of island ownership are not unique to Gigha and consequently the island has been highlighted in an edition of the BBC series, &quot;Countryfile&quot;.

In 2010 the historian James Hunter stated that the transfer of ownership had brought about &quot;a spectacular reversal of Gigha&#x27;s slide towards complete population collapse&quot; and suggested that the UK Government should learn lessons from Gigha and other community buy-outs to inform their &quot;Big Society&quot; plans. Between 2001 and the 2011 census the island&#x27;s population grew by over 45%. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

=== Wind turbines ===

The Heritage Trust set up Gigha Renewable Energy Ltd. to buy and operate three Vestas V27 wind turbines, known locally as &quot;The Dancing Ladies&quot; or &quot;Creideas, Dòchas is Carthannas&quot; (Gaelic for &quot;Faith, Hope and Charity&quot;). They were commissioned on 21 January 2005 and are capable of generating up to 675 kW of power. Revenue is produced by selling the electricity to the grid via an intermediary called Green Energy UK. Gigha residents control the whole project and profits are reinvested in the community. In 2016 two batteries were added to the system.

=== Transport and infrastructure ===

There is an unmanned grass landing strip running east–west near the southern end of the island, requiring prior permission for landing. It is one of the closest airstrips to Glasgow International Airport, typically a 20- to 30-minute flight away for small aircraft.

A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service links the island&#x27;s only village, Ardminish, to Tayinloan on the Kintyre peninsula of the Scottish mainland. This in turn links to the A83 road.

There is a primary school on the island, but secondary pupils must go to the mainland for education. Ardminish has the pier, post office and shop. The island&#x27;s postcode is PA41.

=== Attractions ===
Attractions on the island include the Achamore Gardens, begun in 1945 by Sir James Horlick and known for its rhododendrons and azaleas, the many sandy beaches and the thirteenth-century St Catan&#x27;s Chapel ruins. There is also a nine-hole golf course, which is currently not in use.

== Wildlife ==

Because it is set on the eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean, Gigha attracts a wide variety of sea birds such as guillemot and eider, which breed on Eilean Garbh. Inland, ducks such as mallard, teal, wigeon and pochard can be found along with heron, snipe, pheasant and red grouse. The hooded crow and jackdaw are present in considerable numbers, but geese are only occasional visitors. Mammals are under-represented; there are no red deer, stoat, weasel, red fox or hare. In the mid-20th century Gigha had eight boats engaged in fishing for cod and lobster, but commercial activity ceased some time ago.

== Shipwrecks ==

Gigha&#x27;s coasts have seen numerous wrecks. In August 1886 the &quot;Staffa&quot; ran aground on Cath Sgier west of Craro. The ship remained on the reef in calm overnight conditions and all crew and 21 passengers were rescued the following morning. On 8 April 1894 the steamship &quot;Udea&quot; was lost on the same rocks with a cargo of coal and iron. Owned by David MacBrayne, she was &quot;en route&quot; from Glasgow to Lewis at the time. On 16 September 1940 the British steam liner &quot;Aska&quot; was bombed by a German aircraft south of Gigha whilst carrying French troops from Gambia. Twelve crewmen died in the attack and 75 survivors were successfully picked up by trawlers. On fire, the &quot;Aska&quot; drifted onto Cara and was wrecked there. Four years later the &quot;Mon Cousu&quot; was deliberately sunk in the Sound of Gigha and used for bombing practice. In 1991 the Russian factory ship &quot;Kartli&quot; was hit by two freak waves off Islay and ran aground at Port Ban after the crew were evacuated. Forty seven crew members were air-lifted to safety but four men were killed in the accident.

== Culture ==
Gigha had a vigorous tradition of harping, represented mainly by the family called Mac an Bhreatnaigh (Galbraith), who were active in Gigha and Kintyre, and it is thought that their descendants were in Gigha until at least 1685.

=== Gaelic ===
In the 1990s it was reported that many of the island&#x27;s residents spoke Gaelic, although the numbers have declined significantly in recent years.

Gigha has historically been a very strong Gaelic speaking area. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, the island was reported to be over 75% Gaelic speaking. By 1971, the proportion had dropped to the 25–49.9% range. In the 2001 census, the percentage of Gaelic speakers had dropped to 14%.

In the 1930s, Gigha Gaelic was studied extensively by N.M. Holmer, who noted features such as its weak &quot;svarabhakti&quot;.

In 2008, Henri Macaulay of Gigha Gallery received funding from the Gaelic development body, Bord na Gàidhlig, to run a series of Gaelic-learning weekends on the island as a combined cultural-revival and tourism-development initiative. Conversation and music formed the backbone of the weekends. They ran through the winter months.

<text>Zuo Zongtang (左宗棠, Xiang Chinese: ; Wade-Giles spelling: Tso Tsung-t&#x27;ang; November 10, 1812 – September 5, 1885), sometimes referred to as General Tso, was a Chinese statesman and army officer of the late Qing dynasty.

Born in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, Zuo sat for the imperial examination in his youth but obtained only a &quot;juren&quot; degree. He then spent his time studying agriculture, geography and military strategy. In 1851, he started his career in the Qing military by participating in the campaign against the Taiping Rebellion. In 1862, he was recommended by Zeng Guofan to serve as the provincial governor of Zhejiang Province. During his term, he coordinated Qing forces to attack the Taiping rebels with support from British and French forces. For this success, he was promoted to Viceroy of Min-Zhe. After capturing Hangzhou from the Taiping rebels in 1864, he was enfeoffed as a first class count. In 1866, as part of the Qing government&#x27;s Self-Strengthening Movement, Zuo oversaw the construction of the Fuzhou Arsenal and naval academy. That same year, he was reassigned to serve as the Viceroy of Shaan-Gan, where he oversaw industrialization in Gansu Province. In 1867, he was appointed as an Imperial Commissioner in charge of military affairs in Gansu.

During his term as Imperial Commissioner in Gansu, he participated in the suppression of the Nian Rebellion. In 1875, he was appointed Imperial Commissioner again to supervise military action against the Dungan Revolt. By the late 1870s, he had crushed the Dungan Revolt and recaptured Xinjiang Province from rebel forces. In 1875, the Guangxu Emperor made an extraordinary exception by awarding Zuo a &quot;jinshi&quot; degree – even though Zuo never achieved this in the imperial examination – and appointing him to the Hanlin Academy. In 1878, in recognition of his achievements, Zuo was promoted from a first class count to a second class marquis. He was reassigned to serve as the Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1881 and appointed to the Grand Council in 1884, before being made an Imperial Commissioner again to oversee naval affairs. He died in 1885 in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, and was given the posthumous name Wenxiang.

While Zuo is best known outside China for his military exploits, he also made contributions to Chinese agricultural science and education. In particular, he promoted cotton cultivation to northwestern China as a replacement for cash crop opium and established a large-scale modern press in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces which published Confucian classics and newer works on agricultural science.

The dish General Tso&#x27;s chicken in American Chinese cuisine was named after Zuo, though there is no recorded connection between him and the meal.

==Names==
Zuo Zongtang&#x27;s family name was Zuo and his given name was Zongtang. His courtesy name was Jigao () or Cun (). His art name (or pseudonym) was Xiangshang Nongren (), which means &quot;peasant from Xiang&quot;. He often signed off by the name Jinliang (), which means &quot;(Zhuge) Liang of today&quot;, since he liked to compare himself with Zhuge Liang.

The titles of nobility he held were First Class Count Kejing () from 1864 to 1878, and Second Class Marquis Kejing () from 1878 to his death in 1885. Zuo&#x27;s posthumous name, granted by the Qing imperial court, was Wenxiang ().

Zuo was nicknamed &quot;Zuo Luozi&quot; () (&quot;Zuo the mule&quot;) for his stubbornness.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Zuo was born in 1812 in a land-holding family in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province. His family paid for him to attend a local private school starting from the age of five, where he mastered the Confucian classics. At the age of 20, he qualified to attend the Imperial Academy.

Zuo&#x27;s career got an inauspicious start when, in his youth, he failed the imperial examination seven times (ca. 1822–1835). He decided to abandon his plans to become an official and returned to his home by the Xiang River to farm silkworms, read, and drink tea. It was during this period that he first directed his attention to the study of Western sciences, in the early days of the eastward spread of Western learning.

===Taiping Rebellion===
When the Taiping Rebellion broke out in 1850, Zuo, then 38 years old, was hired as an advisor to Zeng Guofan, the governor of Hunan. In 1856, he was formally offered a position in the provincial government of Hunan. In 1860, Zuo was given command of a force of 5,000 volunteers, the Xiang Army (later known as &quot;Chu Army&quot;), and by September of that year, he drove the Taiping rebels out of Hunan and Guangxi provinces, into coastal Zhejiang Province. Zuo captured the city of Shaoxing and, from there, pushed south into Fujian and Guangdong provinces, where the revolt had first begun. In 1863, Zuo was appointed Provincial Governor of Zhejiang and an Undersecretary of War.

In August 1864, Zuo, together with Zeng Guofan, dethroned the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&#x27;s teenage ruler, Hong Tianguifu, and brought an end to the rebellion. He was created &quot;First Class Count Kejing&quot; for his part in suppressing the rebellion. He, Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang were called &quot;Zeng, Zuo, Li&quot;, the leaders in suppressing the rebellion.

In 1865, Zuo was appointed Viceroy and Governor-General of Fujian and Zhejiang. As Commissioner of Naval Industries, Zuo founded China&#x27;s first modern shipyard and naval academy in Fuzhou the following year.

=== Success and appointments ===
Zuo&#x27;s successes continued. In 1867, he became Viceroy of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and Imperial Commissioner of the armed forces in Shaanxi. In 1884, his fellow Xiang Army officer, Liu Jintang, was appointed as the first governor of Xinjiang Province. The Governor of Xinjiang was the subordinate to the Viceroy of Shaanxi and Gansu.

In these capacities, Zuo succeeded in putting down another uprising, the Nian Rebellion, in 1868.

After this military success, Zuo marched west with his army of 120,000, winning many victories with advanced Western weapons in the Dungan Revolt in northwestern China (Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces) in the 1870s.

Several Hui Muslim generals, such as Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, Ma Anliang, Ma Qianling, Dong Fuxiang, and Ma Haiyan from Hezhou, who had defected to Zuo&#x27;s army, helped him crush the &quot;Muslim rebels&quot;. Zuo rewarded them by relocating the Han Chinese from the suburbs of Hezhou to another place and allowing their troops to stay in the Hezhou suburbs as long as they did not live in the city itself.

In 1878, Zuo successfully suppressed Yakub Beg&#x27;s uprising and helped to negotiate an end to Russian occupation of the border city of Ili. He was vocal in the debate at the Qing imperial court over what to do with the Xinjiang situation, advocating for Xinjiang to become a province, in opposition to Li Hongzhang, who wanted to abandon what he called &quot;useless Xinjiang&quot; and concentrate on defending China&#x27;s coastal areas. However, Zuo won the debate, Xinjiang was made a province, and many administrative functions were staffed by his Hunan officers.

Zuo was outspoken in calling for war against the Russian Empire, hoping to settle the matter by attacking Russian forces in Xinjiang with his Xiang Army. In 1878, when tension increased in Xinjiang, Zuo massed Qing forces toward the Russian-occupied Kuldja. The &quot;Canadian Spectator&quot; stated in 1878, &quot;News from Turkestan says the Chinese are concentrating against Kuldja, a post in Kashgar occupied by the Russians... It is reported that a Russian expedition from Yart Vernaic has been fired upon by Chinese troops and forced to return.&quot; The Russians were afraid of the Qing forces, thousands of whom were armed with modern weapons and trained by European officers. Because the Russian forces near the Qing Empire&#x27;s border were under-manned and under-equipped, they agreed to negotiate.

Zuo&#x27;s troops were armed with modern German Dreyse needle rifles and Krupp artillery as well as experimental weapons.

For his contributions to his nation and monarch, Zuo was appointed a Grand Secretary to the Grand Secretariat in 1874 and elevated to &quot;Second Class Marquis Kejing&quot; in 1878.

===Later life and death===
Zuo was appointed to the Grand Council, the cabinet of the Qing Empire at the time, in 1880. Uneasy with bureaucratic politics, Zuo asked to be relieved of his duties and was appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1881. In 1884, upon the outbreak of the Sino-French War, Zuo received his fourth and last commission as commander-in-chief and Imperial Commissioner of the military and Inspector-General overseeing coastal defences in Fujian Province.

==Legacy==

Zuo was admired by many generals who came after him. During the Republican era, the Kuomintang general Bai Chongxi wanted to reconquer Xinjiang for the Nationalist government, in Zuo&#x27;s style, and expelled Russian influence from the area. Zuo was also referred to by Kuomintang general Ma Zhongying (a descendant of a Salar noble) as one of his models, as Ma led the National Revolutionary Army&#x27;s 36th Division to reconquer Xinjiang for the Nationalist government from the pro-Soviet governor Jin Shuren during the Kumul Rebellion.

While Zuo is best known for his military acumen, he believed that the key to peace and stability lay in an educated, prosperous citizenry. He sometimes referred to himself by his art name, &quot;peasant from Xiang&quot;, and was keenly interested in agriculture. He advocated the scientific reform of commercial agriculture both as a way to strengthen China&#x27;s economic self-sufficiency and also as a way to manage civilian populations by improving their standard of living and controlling the kinds of crops they grew. During the 12 years he spent in northwestern China, he undertook extensive agricultural research on different crops and methods. Comparing the benefits and indications of two ancient agricultural methods, the more established long field, crop rotation method () and the less common intensive, small-field method (), Zuo believed that the latter method, cultivating small fields of densely-planted monocultures, was more suitable to the dry, extreme climate of the northwest region. To promote this method, he authored two pamphlets explaining the method which were then distributed freely to local farming communities. Zuo also recognised the threat of opium to the nation&#x27;s stability and economic health and advocated replacing opium poppies with cotton as the major cash crop in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. He authorised the large scale distribution of cotton seeds and published pamphlets on its cultivation and processing. In 1878, he also oversaw the establishment of a large weaving factory in present-day Mulan County, Gansu Province, with the aim of creating a new textile industry in the region and providing socially-acceptable employment to women.

In addition to managing the peasantry by improving their economic circumstances, Zuo also believed that increasing access to traditional Chinese philosophy would help to pacify areas experiencing unrest and ultimately create a more contented and unified populace. To this end, Zuo set up a printing press in northwestern China which printed Chinese classics, as well as agricultural pamphlets. When Zuo first arrived in the region, a decade of constant warfare had virtually stopped all publishing in the region. Zuo prioritised reestablishing the printing industry a priority and thousands of copies of the publications he authorised were distributed in Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi and Xinjiang. Printing appears to have stopped when Zuo returned to Beijing, but the endeavour is credited with inspiring later printing presses.

==Family==
Zuo&#x27;s great-grandparents were Zuo Fengsheng () and Madam Jiang (). His grandparents were Zuo Renjin () and Madam Yang (). His parents were Zuo Guanlan (; 1778–1830) and Madam Yu (; 1775–1827).

Zuo had two elder brothers: Zuo Zongyu (; 1799–1823) and Zuo Zongzhi (; 1804–1872).

In 1832, Zuo married Zhou Yiduan (; 1812–1870), a woman from Paitou Township, Xiangtan County in Hunan Province. Zhou&#x27;s courtesy name was &quot;Junxin&quot; (). They had four daughters and four sons as follows:
* Zuo Xiaoyu (; 1833–?), courtesy name Shenjuan (), Zuo&#x27;s first daughter. She married Tao Zhu&#x27;s son, Tao Guang (). She wrote &quot;Shi Shiwu Shicao&quot; ().
* Zuo Xiaoqi (; 1834–1873), courtesy name Jingzhai (), Zuo&#x27;s second daughter. She wrote &quot;Yilan Shi Shicao&quot; ().
* Zuo Xiaolin (; 1837–?), courtesy name Xiangju (), Zuo&#x27;s third daughter. She married Li Fuchang () from Xiangtan County. She wrote &quot;Qionghua Ge Shicao&quot; ().
* Zuo Xiaobin (; 1837–?), courtesy name Shaohua (), Zuo&#x27;s fourth daughter. She married Zhou Yibiao () from Xiangtan County. She wrote &quot;Dan Ru Zhai Yishi&quot; ().
* Zuo Xiaowei (; 1846–1873), courtesy name Zizhong (), Zuo&#x27;s first son.
* Zuo Xiaokuan (; 1847–?), Zuo&#x27;s second son.
* Zuo Xiaoxun (; 1853–?), Zuo&#x27;s third son.
* Zuo Xiaotong (; 1857–1924), courtesy name Ziyi (), Zuo&#x27;s fourth son.

==General Tso&#x27;s chicken==

The dish General Tso&#x27;s chicken in American Chinese cuisine was introduced in Taiwan and then in America in the 1970s, inspired by a dish originally prepared by Peng Chang-kuei, a Taiwanese chef specialising in Hunan cuisine. Peng named the dish in honour of Zuo Zongtang.

One apocryphal story, for which no evidence is offered, credits the Chinese and Southeast Asian stuffed pancake &quot;Apam balik&quot; to the general. He is said to have invented it as a way to use local products and save his men from more expensive ingredients.

<doc id="472057" wikidata="Q6604976" url="?curid=472057" title="List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons">
<text>This is a list of all of the active squadrons that exist in the United States Marine Corps, sorted by type. Most squadrons have changed names and designations many times over the years, so they are listed by their current designation.

:&quot;To see Marine Aviation units sorted by command hierarchy, see aviation combat element.&quot;

==Squadron designations==
The basic tactical and administrative unit of United States Marine Corps aviation is the squadron. Fixed-wing aircraft squadrons (heavier than air) and tiltrotor squadrons are denoted by the letter &quot;V&quot;, which comes from the Spanish verb &quot;volar&quot; (to fly). Rotary wing (helicopter) squadrons use &quot;H.&quot; Marine squadrons are always noted by the second letter &quot;M.&quot; Squadron numbering is not linear as some were numbered in ascending order and others took numbers from the wing or the ship to which they were assigned. From 1920 to 1941, Marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers. This changed on 1 July 1941, when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a three-digit system. The first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during World War II and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart.

==Rotary-wing aircraft==

===Marine Helicopter Squadron===

The squadron is responsible for the helicopter transportation of the president of the United States, vice president, Cabinet members and VIPs. In addition to its VIP transport role, it is also tasked with operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) of new flight systems for Marine Corps helicopters. The squadron flies the VH-3D Sea King the VH-60N Whitehawk, and the MV-22 Osprey. These were due to be replaced by the VH-71 Kestrel, however that program was cancelled in April 2009. HMX-1 is now preparing for the arrival of the VH-92A Patriot, which will replace the VH-3D that serves as Marine One. 
Lastly, HMX-1 provides support to training at The Basic School, providing aerial insertion for various training events, as well as MAGTF Air component orientation to the student officers.


=== Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons ===

Heavy helicopter squadrons were first formed in 1966 when the Marine Corps began flying the heavy lift CH-53 Sea Stallion during the Vietnam War. Each squadron is equipped with sixteen CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. Their primary role is moving cargo and equipment with the secondary role of transferring troops ashore in an amphibious assault. The CH-53Es are the most powerful helicopter in the U.S. military inventory today. As part of the current reorganization of the Corps, HMH-462 will be decommissioned by 2030.
===Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron===
The squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-53E Super Stallion.

=== Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons ===

The Marine Corps’ light attack squadrons are composite squadrons made up of 18 AH-1Z Vipers and 9 UH-1Y Venoms. The primary missions of the Viper is close air support, forward air control, reconnaissance and armed escort, while the Huey provides airborne command and control, utility support, supporting arms coordination and medical evacuation. The H-1 upgrade program will see both the AH-1 and UH-1 get greater power, improved avionics and an 85% commonality of parts. The transition to the UH-1Y was completed in August 2014 when HMLA-773 flew the UH-1N for the last time. Due to the need for more light attack squadrons, the Marine Corps began adding new squadrons in 2008. HMLA-469 is the newest squadron. However, as part of the re-organization of the corps, HMLA-469 and HMLA-367 will be de-activated by 2030.
===Marine Light Attack Helicopter Training Squadron===
The squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the UH-1Y Venom, and the AH-1Z Viper.

==Tiltrotor Aircraft==

=== Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadrons ===

Marine tiltrotor squadrons are new units operating the MV-22 Osprey with their main mission being assault support. The Osprey offers twice the speed, five times the range, and can fly more than twice as high as the helicopters they are replacing. As the Marine Corps’ number one aviation acquisition priority, the Osprey replaced the aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and is a cornerstone of the capstone concept of Expeditionary maneuver warfare. As of October 2017, the Marine Corps has 16 Fully Operationally Capable (FOC) MV-22 squadrons. VMM-268, VMM-364, and VMM-164 reached FOC in FY16. The two newest Osprey squadrons, VMM-362 and VMM-212, will stand up in FY18 and FY19 respectively, completing the Marine Corps&#x27; transition to 18 active component MV-22 squadrons. Each squadron operates 12 aircraft.


===Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron===
The squadron provides new and conversion training to Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force pilots and units in the use and maintenance of the Osprey tiltrotor aircraft.

==Fixed-Wing Aircraft==

=== Marine Attack Squadrons ===
Marine attack squadrons fly the AV-8B Harrier II and are tasked with providing close air support, air interdiction, surveillance and escort of helicopters. Because the STOVL Harrier can operate from amphibious assault ships, expeditionary airfields and tactical remote landing sites, it provides commanders with more flexibility in providing air support. The Harrier is due to be replaced by the F-35B, the STOVL version of the F-35 Lightning II. This transition began in 2016 when VMA-211 exchanged its Harriers for the F-35B and became VMFA-211.
VMA-223 will transition to F-35B in 2027, while VMA-231 will transition to F-35B in 2026.

=== Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons ===
The Marine Corps&#x27; VMFA squadrons fly the F/A-18 Hornet and F-35 Lightning II. Their primary mission is to attack and destroy surface targets, during both day and nighttime operations, under all weather conditions; conduct multi-sensor imagery reconnaissance; provide supporting arms coordination; and intercept and destroy enemy aircraft in all weather conditions. The current F/A-18s saw first deployments during Operation Desert Storm, after having replaced the A-6 Intruder. Each Hornet squadron operates 12 aircraft and each F-35 squadron operates 10 to 12 aircraft.
* VMFA(AW)-224 will transition to F-35B in 2025.
* VMFA-115 will reactivate as a F-35C squadron in 2026.
* VMFA-312 will transition to F-35B in 2028.
* VMFA-232 will transition to F-35C in 2029.
* VMFA-323 will transition to F-35C in 2029.
* VMFA-112 will transition to F-35C in 2030.
* VMFA-134 will re activate as a F-35C reserve squadron in 2031.

===Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadrons===
VMFAT squadrons train newly designated Naval Aviators to fly Marine Corps Aircraft.

===Marine Fighter Training Squadron===
VMFT-401 and VMFT-402 are the only aggressor squadrons in the Marine Corps. They fly the F-5E Tiger II and provide instruction to active and reserve squadrons through dissimilar adversary combat tactics. The squadrons are based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, AZ, and Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, SC, respectively, and are assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 41, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine Forces Reserve.

=== Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadrons ===
VMGR squadrons operate the KC-130 Hercules tanker/transport. Their primary missions are aerial and rapid ground refueling, transportation of personnel and cargo to include MEDEVACs and parachute insertions, flying the airborne version of the Direct Air Support Center (DASC) and emergency resupply into unimproved landing zones.
===Marine Transport Squadron===

VMR squadrons provide search and rescue support as well as movement of key personnel and critical logistics support around the world. They also provide movement of high priority passengers and cargo during wartime in support of operations and other critical commitments. 

===Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron===
The squadron is a Marine Corps test and development unit. Its mission is to conduct operational testing and evaluation of Marine Corps fixed, tiltrotor, and rotary-wing aircraft. The unit was re-designated to VMX-1 (from VMX-22) on 13 May 2016.

==Unmanned Aerial Systems==

===Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadrons===
VMUs operate the RQ-21 Blackjack unmanned aerial system (UAS) which provides Marine ground forces with reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. They also provide artillery spotting and can assist in search and rescue operations. Due to the high operational tempo of the VMU squadrons in recent years, the Marine Corps stood up VMU-3 in 2008 and VMU-4, a reserve unit, was activated in 2010 with the lineage of VMO-4.

<text>Joe Klein (born September 7, 1946) is an American political commentator and author. He is best known for his work as a columnist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine and his novel &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, an anonymously written roman à clef portraying Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign. Klein is currently a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and is a former Guggenheim Fellow. In April 2006 he published &quot;Politics Lost&quot;, a book on what he calls the &quot;pollster–consultant industrial complex.&quot; He has also written articles and book reviews for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Klein was born in Rockaway Beach, Queens, the son of Miram (née Warshauer) and John Klein, a printer. His maternal grandfather was professional musician Frank Warshauer. He has referred to his heritage as Jewish.

Klein graduated from the Hackley School and the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in American civilization. In 1969 Klein began reporting for the Essex County Newspapers, and &quot;The Peabody Times&quot; in Peabody, Massachusetts. In 1972 he reported for Boston&#x27;s WGBH, and until 1974 he was also the news editor for &quot;The Real Paper&quot; in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a contributing editor for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; from 1975 to 1980, and Washington bureau chief from 1975 to 1977. He became friends with actor-director Tom Laughlin after interviewing him for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and appeared briefly as a reporter in Laughlin&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Billy Jack Goes to Washington&quot;.

Klein published &quot;Woody Guthrie: A Life&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Payback: Five Marines After Vietnam&quot; in 1984. He was a political columnist for &quot;New York&quot; from 1987 to 1992, winning the Peter Kihss Award for his reporting on the 1989 race for mayor of New York. In May 1992 he joined &quot;Newsweek&quot; and wrote the column &quot;Public Lives,&quot; which won a National Headliner Award in 1994. &quot;Newsweek&quot; also won a National Magazine Award for their coverage of Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 victory. From 1992 to 1996 he was also a consultant for CBS News, providing commentary.

==&quot;Primary Colors&quot;==

In January 1996, Klein anonymously published the novel &quot;Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics&quot;, based on the 1992 Democratic presidential primary. The book spent nine weeks as number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, with its author listed as &quot;Anonymous.&quot; Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet and, later, Vassar professor Donald Foster correctly identified Klein as the novel&#x27;s author, based on a literary analysis of the book and Klein&#x27;s previous writing. Klein denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster. Klein denied authorship again in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, speculating that another writer wrote it. &quot;Washington Post&quot; Style editor David Von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed. On July 17, 1996, Klein admitted that the speculation had been correct.

==Later career==
In December 1996 he joined &quot;The New Yorker&quot; to write the Letter from Washington column. In 2000 he published &quot;The Running Mate&quot;, a sequel of sorts to &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. In March 2002 Klein published &quot;The Natural: Bill Clinton&#x27;s Misunderstood Presidency&quot;, an account of Clinton&#x27;s two terms in office.

In January 2003, he joined &quot;Time&quot; to write a column called In the Arena on national and international affairs. It appears in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s upfront Notebook section and has been criticized for its reporting about then–minority leader Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic opposition to warrantless wiretapping. The column has been the source of several retractions by &quot;Time&quot;.

Klein was a regular blogger on time.com&#x27;s now-defunct &quot;Swampland&quot; blog. In November 2007, &quot;Salon&quot; columnist Glenn Greenwald wrote about what he alleged were factual errors in a Klein story about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Klein reported that the Democratic version of the FISA bill &quot;would require the surveillance of every foreign-terrorist target&#x27;s calls to be approved by the FISA court&quot; and that it, therefore &quot;would give terrorists the same legal protections as Americans.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; later published a comment: &quot;In the original version of this story, Joe Klein wrote that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) would allow a court review of individual foreign surveillance targets. Republicans believe the bill can be interpreted that way, but Democrats don&#x27;t.&quot; Greenwald noted that the text of the legislation does not require court review of individual targets, and that &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s response disregards this fact. Klein&#x27;s response was, &quot;I have neither the time nor legal background to figure out who&#x27;s right.&quot;

Later, Greenwald reported that &quot;Time&quot; &quot;refused the requests of two sitting members of Congress ... to correct Klein&#x27;s false statements in Time itself.&quot; Greenwald has reported that Senator Russ Feingold has been informed by &quot;Time&quot; that his letter rebutting Klein will be published in a forthcoming issue.

In October 2012 Klein was criticized by Glenn Greenwald for revealing on MSNBC&#x27;s Morning Joe program his advocacy of U.S. drone strikes. Klein dismissed child deaths caused by drones in the countries where they are operating, stating that the bottom line, in the end, was to ask &quot;whose 4-year-olds get killed? What we&#x27;re doing is limiting the possibility that 4-year-olds here will get killed by indiscriminate acts of terror.&quot;

In a June 2013 cover story for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Klein reported on Oklahoma tornado relief, but came under fire for implying secular humanists did not help deliver aid. Klein later clarified he only meant to refer to &quot;organized&quot; secular humanist groups, a claim that was also contested and called inaccurate.

In October 2014 Klein traveled to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for his article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine titled &quot;Shut down in Tuscaloosa.&quot; Klein interviewed a small number of academics from the University of Alabama. Klein&#x27;s article came under fire from the focus group he interviewed due to allegations of misquotes, improper citations, and wrong names used in the interview.

==Political views==
In the 1990s, Klein wrote an influential cover story for &quot;Newsweek&quot; defining and, to some extent, defending radical centrism, &quot;Stalking the Radical Middle.&quot; He said radical-middle activism was fueling &quot;what is becoming a significant intellectual movement, nothing less than an attempt to replace the traditional notions of liberalism and conservatism.&quot; Some of Klein&#x27;s later journalism is in that same vein.

In &quot;The Natural&quot;, his book about the Clinton presidency, Klein gave a mixed assessment of Clinton&#x27;s time in office. In the book, he wrote: &quot;The conventions of journalism prevent me from fitting too neatly into one political niche (although as a columnist for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; my predilections are obvious).&quot; Klein&#x27;s depiction of the Clinton presidency also gave a detailed examination of the moderate Democratic positions espoused by the Democratic Leadership Council, as well as third way politics generally, of which Klein was highly complimentary.

In January 2011, during an appearance on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Reliable Sources&quot;, Klein criticized the mainstream media for not handling complex issues properly, singling out MSNBC host Ed Schultz:

==Friction with conservatives==
===Jewish neoconservatives and divided loyalties===

In 2008, Klein caused controversy with comments on the motivations of Jewish neoconservatives, when he said:

American foreign policy scholar Max Boot and the Anti-Defamation League national director, Abraham Foxman, were among the critics of Klein&#x27;s views.

In an interview published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine discussing the controversy, Klein stated

===Other===
In May 2009 he invited further controversy when he was quoted in a Politico.com article, wherein he stated that the reasoning and ideas of prominent conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer were of limited value because of Krauthammer&#x27;s wheelchair use:

There&#x27;s something tragic about him. ... His work would have a lot more nuance if he were able to see the situations he&#x27;s writing about.

Klein has been criticized by several publications for accusing former CNN&#x27;s Headline News and Fox News host Glenn Beck, Republican senator Tom Coburn, and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin of sedition.

==Personal life==
Klein&#x27;s first wife was Janet Eklund. The couple were married from 1967 to 1975 and have two children, Christopher and Terry. , Klein lives in New Rochelle, New York with his second wife, swimwear designer Victoria Kaunitz, with whom he has two children, daughter Sophie and son Teddy.
