<text>The Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) was a rebel group in Liberia that was active from 1999 until the resignation of Charles Taylor ended the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003. While the group formally dissolved after the war, the interpersonal linkages of the civil war era remain a key force in internal Liberian politics.

The group&#x27;s only stated political purpose during the civil war that followed its rebellion against President Charles Taylor was to force him out of office: &quot;Taylor must go&quot;. The group received support from Liberian diasporas in other African countries, Europe and the United States, but especially from the government of neighboring Guinea after the Taylor-supported invasion of the country in September 2000. Like the other two warring factions during the Second War, LURD was accused of committing atrocities during the war. This group was ethnically Mandingo and Krahn but later divided into two groups; Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) which was ethnically Krahn while the Mandingo continued to fight in LURD. The distinction between these two groups is often messy as some Krahn continued to fight with LURD, while some Mandingos fought with MODEL.

According to Käihkö, LURD is best understood as a loose coalition united by an equally loose ideology, which focused on getting rid of Taylor. Initially there were different groups that shared the same goal, but acted independently in both Sierra Leone and Liberia. When the plan to wage this kind of two-front war failed due to Sierra Leonean reluctance, and especially when Guinea began to support the Liberians in the country against Taylor&#x27;s aggression, these various groups moved to Guinea. Because Guinean support was channeled through the Chairman Sekou Conneh, he gained some leverage to unite the movement. While the cohesion of LURD always remained brittle, it was widely recognized that unity was necessary if Taylor was to be removed from power. Many in the LURD leadership also remembered what had happened to its predecessor, the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), which had split in 1994. As a result, the LURD internal organization assumed power-sharing, not least between the dominant Krahn and Mandingo groups and their leaders.

Early on in the war the anti-Taylor elements launched hit-and-run attacks from Sierra Leone and Guinea, but after the Guinean support LURD established its headquarters in Voinjama, the county capital of Lofa County. Once it had gained territory in the south this headquarters was moved south to Tubmanburg in Bomi County. In Bomi county the Mahare Massacre took place in 2002, which killed 355 civilians. Duo&#x27;s military group captured the area and all civilians were seen as LURD supporters which in turn lead to mass killings. According to James Kabah cited in Christine Cheng&#x27;s Book,[Extralegal Groups in Post-Conflict Liberia],that men, women and children were lined up and shot 10 at a time. After years of fighting LURD laid siege to Liberia&#x27;s capital, Monrovia on June 4, 2003. However, it was unable to capture it. During the siege, the group was accused of firing mortar shells into civilian areas of the city, killing dozens of people.

However, independent investigations conducted by civil society groupings said the widespread death caused was also due to Charles Taylor&#x27;s Anti Terrorist Unit and other militias.

LURD&#x27;s successes in occupying northern Liberia and besieging Monrovia, in addition to the successes of another rebel group in southeastern Liberia (the Movement for Democracy in Liberia, or MODEL) and heavy pressure from the United States and the international community, effectively forced President Taylor to resign. He went into exile in Nigeria on August 11, 2003, as part of a peace agreement. A transitional government headed by Gyude Bryant was established on October 14, and it included many representatives of LURD. One of LURD&#x27;s founders, lanzini, became Speaker of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly. After the war ended in 2003, LURD and MODEL as well as the government of Liberia still controlled resource areas including rubber plantations and were able to profit from the sale of rubber for the next 3 years.

In January 2004, LURD was divided by a power struggle between its chairman, Sekou Conneh, and his wife Aisha Conneh, an adviser to the President of Guinea, Lansana Conté. The group promised to disarm as part of the 2003 peace agreement, although it was accused of simply moving most of its weapons into safekeeping across the border in Sierra Leone. In June 2004, Chayee Doe, the vice-chairman of LURD and younger brother of Samuel Kanyon Doe, was briefly appointed chairman despite an illness but died two days later.

George Dweh was suspended indefinitely as Speaker of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly on April 28, 2005, along with his deputy Eddington Varmah and Ways, Means &amp; Finance&#x27;s Committee Chairman Tarplah Doe, for widespread corruption.

The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) have completed the disarmament of 100,000 ex-combatants from LURD, MODEL and the ex-government of Liberia. The process commenced on December 7, 2003 but was abruptly stopped after militia men demanded money for handing in their guns. The process re-commenced and each ex-combatant received 300 United States dollars.

Testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on August 28, 2008, Sekou Conneh said that, during the war, Sierra Leone and Guinea had allowed the LURD rebels free passage &quot;through their borders with our arms without any questions from them&quot;.

<doc id="469640" wikidata="Q558799" url="?curid=469640" title="Muslim Magomayev (musician)">
<text>Muslim Muhammad oghlu Magomayev ( / ; 17 August 1942 – 25 October 2008), dubbed the &quot;Soviet [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]&quot;, was a Soviet and Russo-Azerbaijani opera and pop singer. He achieved widespread recognition throughout Russia and the post-Soviet world for his vocal talent and charisma, including a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR award in 1973.

==Early life==
Muslim Magomayev represented one of the most respected artistic dynasties in Azerbaijan. His grandfather Muslim Magomayev (1885–1937), a friend and contemporary of the prominent Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov, was one of the founders of modern Azerbaijani classical music. Magomayev&#x27;s father, Mahammad Magomayev, who died two days prior to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II while serving as a soldier in the Soviet Army, was a gifted scenic designer; and his mother, Aishet Kinzhalova, was an actress, who deserted him with his paternal grandmother when he was less than a year old. Magomayev&#x27;s father was of mixed origin whose parents moved to Azerbaijan from Chechnya and Georgia respectively, whereas his Adygea-born mother was paternally of Turkish origin and maternally of Adyghe and Russian descent. However, when asked about his ethnicity, Magomayev considered himself Azerbaijani.

After his adoption by his grandmother he learned to play the piano as a child, and began to take voice lessons at the age of 14. As a teenager, he became interested in Italian songs, American jazz, and other styles of popular music. He majored in piano and composition at the Baku Academy of Music.

==Musical career==

He was 19 when he first performed at an international youth music festival in Helsinki. His performance was noted by Yekaterina Furtseva, then Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, who offered him to be a soloist at the Bolshoi Theatre. Magomayev declined the offer. In 1962, at the age of 20, Magomayev first appeared in Moscow where he performed during the Days of Azerbaijani Culture. He sang an aria from Gounod’s Faust, and the song &quot;Do the Russians Want War?&quot; in a gala concert at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, and became a celebrity on the spot. He recorded three songs with Azerbaijani composer Asya Sultanova. A year later, he gave his first solo concert in the Moscow Tchaikovsky Concert Hall to a full house and became a soloist of the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. Muslim earned fame in the USSR as an opera singer with his performance in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. He also became known for his arias from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, Hajibeyov&#x27;s &quot;Koroghlu&quot; and &quot;Shah Ismayil&quot;, which was composed by his grandfather.

In 1964 and 1965, Muslim was a visiting artist at La Scala in Milan, but turned down the invitation to sing in the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre upon his return. Instead, the singer turned to popular music, becoming a cult figure of soviet estrada for several generations of music lovers in the Soviet Union. Muslim Magomayev&#x27;s popularity in the USSR was overwhelming. He used to gave three concerts a day filling huge arenas all across the Soviet Union, while his albums sold millions.

In 1966 and 1969, Magomayev performed in Olympia with great success. The director of Olympia Bruno Coquatrix offered him a contract, and Magomayev was seriously considering an opportunity to pursue an international career, but Yekaterina Furtseva refused to grant the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s permission, claiming that it needed Magomayev to perform at government concerts. In 1969, he received the Midem Gold Disc Award in Cannes for album sales of over 4.5 million units. In 1973, at the age of 31, Muslim was awarded the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest artistic title: People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR.

Magomayev moved to Moscow in the early 1970s. He became the art director of the Azerbaijan State Bandstand-Symphonic Orchestra in 1975 and toured in Italy, France, Bulgaria, Finland, Canada, United States, Cuba and other countries.

Magomayev was also known as a composer, writing several film soundtracks and songs. In addition, Magomayev acted in films and hosted television and radio broadcasts devoted to prominent musicians of the 20th century.

Magomayev was an influence on many important Soviet musical figures, including Alla Pugacheva, who often spoke fondly of him.

==Personal life==
Magomayev married when he was 19, to Ofelia Veliyeva, but the union did not last a year. His daughter from that first marriage, Marina, lives in the United States. He eventually remarried, this time to the opera singer Tamara Sinyavskaya.

In later life, Magomayev struggled with a serious heart condition.

==Later years==

In the early 2000s, Magomayev officially stopped his musical career and gave only a few performances, together with his wife. He died on 25 October 2008 in his flat in Moscow from a heart attack. He was buried in the Alley of Honor in his native city of Baku, next to his grandfather, on 29 October. The funeral ceremony was attended by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Magomayev&#x27;s widow Tamara Sinyavskaya, his daughter Marina, as well as state officials and international delegations. Thousands of people came to pay a final tribute to the singer.

<text>Punahou School (known as [[Oahu College]] until 1934) is a private, co-educational, college preparatory school for both boys and girls in Honolulu, Hawaii. More than 3,700 students attend the school from kindergarten through 12th grade. The school was established by Protestant missionaries in 1841.

==History==
From 1853 to 1934, the school was known as Oahu College.

Punahou has educated members of the Hawaiian royal family, but is not to be confused with the Royal School.

During World War II, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commandeered much of the Punahou campus. Castle Hall, formerly the girls&#x27; dormitory when Punahou had boarding students, was used as a command center, buildings were connected with tunnels, athletic fields were used as parking lots, and the library was cleared to become sleeping quarters and an officer&#x27;s mess. The cereus hedge on the campus lava rock wall was topped with barbed wire. Punahou students volunteered in hospitals and raised enough in war bonds to purchase two bombers and a fighter (among other airplanes), which were named after alumni who had fallen in service.

In the 1970s, Punahou&#x27;s upper field and gymnasium were used for the Superstars nationally televised athletic competitions.

On August 7, 1972, the campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu.

==Traditions==
Many traditional events take place on campus. On the first Friday and Saturday of each February, the junior class hosts the Punahou Carnival. Proceeds from the carnival contribute to the Financial Aid program. The event is an entertainment highlight each year in Honolulu.

The Holoku Pageant is an annual celebration of the Hawaiian culture and arts. Students perform Hawaiian dances in traditional costumes, from the lovely hula to the intimidating haka.

The annual Sustainability Fair began in 2007 and included on-campus conservation challenges and off-campus coastline preservation. On Rice Field, classes set up canopies to showcase sustainable undertakings and projects, often including local produce sales and informational handouts.

To celebrate the school&#x27;s homecoming, students, faculty, and teachers surround a 20-foot letter P, and ignite it at dusk. This event, the &quot;Flaming P&quot;, is preceded by a spirit week, where students dress and parade creatively.

Seniors write and perform a Variety Show. This play involves most of the class, over 300 students. Seniors also have prom at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, Skip Day at the Kikila Estate and Pounders Beach, and senior lunch. With each student attired in either a blue blazer or a formal white Hawaiian dress, senior year ends with baccalaureate ceremonies at Central Union Church, and commencement at Stan Sheriff Center (since 2018).

Graduates who started Punahou in kindergarten are members of the Thirteen Plus Club.

In June, the school hosts an Alumni Luau on campus that the newly graduated class can enjoy with other alumni. The annual luau also functions as a major fundraising event for the school.

Throughout most of the school&#x27;s history, elementary schoolchildren have been allowed to attend in bare feet. Aloha shirts were once restricted to Fridays, but dress codes were relaxed considerably during the 1970s.

G-Term is an effort for students to explore extracurricular opportunities over the week after students return from winter break. Students can choose from on- and off-island classes.

==Location==

All schools in Honolulu city (public and private) have an urban residential location. Nearby buildings include apartment buildings, private houses, a retirement home, a Catholic school (Maryknoll School), several small churches, and two hospitals.

Punahou shares the entrance to Manoa Valley with the University of Hawaii main campus and a few other schools such as Mid-Pacific Institute.

Punahou students are a few minutes away from the trail to Manoa Falls, the beaches at Ala Moana and Waikiki, downtown Honolulu, Lyon Arboretum, and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

Punahou&#x27;s location provides many opportunities for off-campus learning: field trip destinations for middle school students have included the Bishop Museum, Waikiki Aquarium, Waikiki Shell, Waikiki Natatorium War Memorial, Kawaiahaʻo Church, Sea Life Park, USS Arizona Memorial, Valley of the Temples Memorial Park, Fort Ruger at Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu Zoo, Iolani Palace, Hawaii State Capitol, and the beaches on Oahu&#x27;s North Shore. Clubs and classes often organize trips to neighboring islands, especially to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and the Kohala Coast on the Big Island.

==The school in recent years==

Tuition was $30,480 for the 2023–24 school year, not including student activity fees. Tuition does not cover the entire cost of educating a student, and the school&#x27;s endowment makes up the difference. Punahou reported its endowment at $239 million in 2014. Although these figures are high among mainland U.S. private schools, Honolulu&#x27;s Iolani School has a comparable endowment (twice the endowment per pupil), and Kamehameha Schools has a $5 to $9 billion endowment (30 times the endowment per pupil) with a larger physical plant. Maui has Seabury Hall, which has twice the endowment per pupil.

In the class of 2015, three graduates went to Harvard, three to Princeton, and two to Yale, with 22 total at Ivy League schools. Seven attended Swarthmore, Wellesley, Amherst, Tufts, or Vassar. Four attended Stanford, two Berkeley, four Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 16 Boston University, and 12 New York University, with 23 total at University Athletic Association schools. Students in that class also chose Texas Christian, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, Villanova, Rensselaer Polytechnic, Rochester Institute of Technology, Michigan, Northeastern, Boston College, Olin Engineering, Norwich Military College, NYU Shanghai, Erasmus/Rotterdam, Yonsei/S. Korea, Waseda/Japan, and Edinburgh/UK. Six were selected for study and training at US military academies. Schools throughout California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada are also popular among graduates, and many students choose to attend local schools like the University of Hawaii and Chaminade.

The class of 2012 had 30 of Hawaii&#x27;s 70 National Merit Semifinalists. The class of 2013 had 20 semifinalists, and five of the state&#x27;s ten National Merit Scholars.

Punahou&#x27;s 33 Presidential Scholars were graduates of the classes of &#x27;64, &#x27;66, &#x27;70, &#x27;71, &#x27;75, &#x27;78 (two), &#x27;79, &#x27;82, &#x27;84 (two members), &#x27;85, &#x27;86 (two), &#x27;91, &#x27;92 (two), &#x27;93, &#x27;95, &#x27;96, &#x27;98, &#x27;01, &#x27;02, &#x27;04 (three), &#x27;05, &#x27;06, &#x27;08, &#x27;11, &#x27;16 (two), &#x27;17, and &#x27;21.

In 2006, it was ranked the greenest school in America. In 2017, Punahou&#x27;s sports program was ranked second nationally in the MaxPreps Cup standings.

Punahou&#x27;s student body is diverse, with student selection based on both academic and non-academic considerations. The school is a founding member of the Mastery Transcript Consortium, and uses a competency-based learning framework in some courses.

A recent study of the class of 1979 showed that 15 had a PhD, 22 had an MD, 39 had a JD, 18 had the MBA, 10 had the DDS, DMD, DVM, or ND (about one quarter of the class reaching terminal degrees). 4 were officers in the US armed services. 12 had degrees from Harvard, Yale, or Princeton, 14 from Stanford, 17 from UC Berkeley, and 26 total from Ivy League schools.

===Facilities===

About 5,000 faculty, students, and staff work in 44 buildings on 76 acres. The Robert Thurston Memorial Chapel on campus was building designed and built in 1966 by architect Vladimir Ossipoff and feature textile screens made by local artist Ruthadell Anderson. The school is built over a natural spring. Thurston Chapel&#x27;s wall meets at a pond formed by the spring and features a low hung stained glass.

====Case Middle School====

Before plans were made for a new middle school complex, America Online founder and alumnus Steve Case (&#x27;76) donated $10 million. This led to construction of a new middle school for grades six through eight, Case Middle School, named for Case&#x27;s parents. The project earned a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification and a Project of the Year award in Hawaiian Electric Company&#x27;s Energy Efficiency Awards.

Case Middle School consists of nine buildings with a total cost of roughly $50 million, made possible solely through donations.

====Omidyar K-1 Neighborhood====
In late 2010 a new five-building indoor/outdoor section of campus opened for Punahou&#x27;s youngest students. It was constructed and operated with sustainable living as a principal goal, and the curriculum has a focus on sustainability. With solar energy, efficient landscaping, rain catchment and ecofriendly materials, the complex received a platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council.

Teachers are encouraged to personalize their classroom spaces, and each of the 12 rooms has its own outdoor area that is one-third the size of the interior space to which it is attached.

The total cost was $26 million. Individual buildings are named the Mountain House, Forest House, and City House, and historic Wilcox Hall retains its traditional name. Board of Trustees member and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar (&#x27;84) donated $6 million to the project.

===Athletics===
Punahou&#x27;s athletics program is the most successful in Hawaii. It has won more state championships than any other high school in the nation. In 2008 and in 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked Punahou&#x27;s sports program the best in the country.

Punahou football plays the second half of its season at the Aloha Stadium (where the Pro Bowl and Aloha Bowl were played). In fall 2014, the varsity football team ranked as high as 15th in the nation.

Athletic facilities include the Olympic-size Waterhouse Pool, a football field, a baseball diamond, two softball diamonds, and an eight-lane track. The school also has a fieldhouse for competitive athletics, an open-air weightlifting facility, a gymnasium for physical education and intramural sports, and a tennis center with eight hard surface courts. Rocky Hill has been used as a live firing range for JROTC and competitive target sports. Air riflery uses an indoor firing range.

Students need two athletic credits to graduate, which is a total of four semesters. They can earn these credits through P.E. and ILH sports.

Students compete in 22 sports, including air riflery, baseball, basketball, bowling, canoe paddling, cross country, cheerleading, football, golf, gymnastics, judo, kayaking, riflery, sailing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. Punahou has approximately 120 sports teams. The school is a member of the Interscholastic League of Honolulu.

Punahou teams earned 20 championships in 2009–10, out of about 30 varsity it teams fielded.

====State championships====


===Other programs and honors===
Punahou requires all students (K-12) to attend chapel once a week, where each homeroom is assigned its own seating and attendance is taken. In addition, students attend a mandatory weekly assembly to listen to announcements or watch student performances.

115801 Punahou is a minor planet named in the school&#x27;s honor.

===Sexual assault allegations and litigation===
In April 2020, several former Punahou girls&#x27; basketball players filed a lawsuit over alleged abuse committed by their former coach Dwayne Yuen. Days later, the school disclosed additional sexual assault allegations dating back to the 1970s involving a former faculty member and baseball coach.

In January 2021, the school terminated the employment of a high school teacher based on allegations of sexual misconduct involving a former student. The teacher had been suspended from teaching and banned from campus since late November 2020 pending an internal investigation, which he did not cooperate with. The investigation found that the allegations were credible.

<text>Watercress or yellowcress (Nasturtium officinale) is a species of aquatic flowering plant in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae.

Watercress is a rapidly growing perennial plant native to Eurasia. It is one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans. Watercress and many of its relatives, such as garden cress, mustard, radish, and wasabi, are noteworthy for their piquant flavors.

== Description ==
Watercress can grow up to in length. The stems are hollow and float in water. The leaf structure is pinnately compound. Small, white, and green inflorescences are produced in clusters and are frequently visited by insects, especially hoverflies, such as &quot;Eristalis&quot; flies.

==Taxonomy==
Watercress is listed in some sources as belonging to the genus &quot;Rorippa&quot;, although molecular evidence shows those aquatic species with hollow stems are more closely related to &quot;Cardamine&quot; than &quot;Rorippa&quot;. Despite the Latin name, watercress is not particularly closely related to the flowers popularly known as nasturtiums (&quot;Tropaeolum majus&quot;). &quot;T. majus&quot; belongs to the family Tropaeolaceae, a sister taxon to the Brassicaceae within the order Brassicales.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In some regions, watercress is regarded as a weed, in other regions as an aquatic vegetable or herb. Watercress has grown in many temperate locations worldwide.

Watercress was introduced into China through Hong Kong and Macao in the 1800s from Europe. Its cultivation also spread to highland areas in the tropical regions of Asia.

Clear fast-flowing chalk streams are the primary natural habitat for wild watercress in the United Kingdom. Many settlements in England are named after watercress, from Old English &quot;êacerse&quot;, including Kersey, Kesgrave, Kersal, and Kershopefoot.

== Health concerns ==
Watercress crops grown in the presence of manure can be an environment for parasites such as the liver fluke, &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;. Cultivated watercress has the advantage of being free of the liver fluke.

When introduced into non-native environments watercress can have negative impacts on native species. With the introduction of watercress, the organic matter in the sediment increases which in turn attracts predatory macroinvertebrates that feed on other plants in the environment.

By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1, compounds in watercress may alter drug metabolism in individuals on certain medications such as chlorzoxazone.

Due to its fast-growing nature and invasive species status, &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot; is prohibited in Illinois.

==Uses==
Watercress leaves, stems, and fruit can be eaten raw. In China watercress is often boiled alongside pork and traditional medicinal ingredients to make a wintertime tonic soup. In Vietnam it is generally used raw as a component in salads.

=== Tradition ===
Ancient Romans thought eating it would cure mental illness. Twelfth-century mystic Hildegard of Bingen thought eating it steamed and drinking the water would cure jaundice or fever. Watercress was eaten by Native Americans. Some Native Americans used it to treat kidney illnesses and constipation, and it was thought by some to be an aphrodisiac. Early African Americans used the plant as an abortifacient; it was believed to cause sterility as well.

===Nutrition===

The new tips of watercress leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, although caution should be used when collecting these in the wild because of parasites such as &quot;giardia&quot;. Watercress is 95% water and has low contents of carbohydrates, protein, fat, and dietary fiber. A 100-gram serving of raw watercress provides , is particularly rich in vitamin K (238% of the Daily Value, DV), and contains significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin C, riboflavin, vitamin B6, calcium, and manganese.

====Phytochemicals and cooking====
As a cruciferous vegetable, watercress contains isothiocyanates that are partly destroyed by boiling, while the bioavailability of its carotenoids is slightly increased by cooking. Steaming or microwave cooking retains these phytochemicals a bit better than boiling.

===Cultivation===
Watercress cultivation is practical on both a large scale and a garden scale. Being semi-aquatic, watercress is well-suited to hydroponic cultivation, thriving best in water that is slightly alkaline. It is frequently produced around the headwaters of chalk streams. In many local markets, the demand for hydroponically grown watercress exceeds supply, partly because cress leaves are unsuitable for distribution in dried form and can only be stored fresh for about 2–3 days.

Also sold as sprouts, the edible shoots are harvested days after germination. If unharvested, watercress can grow to a height of .

In the United Kingdom, watercress was first commercially cultivated in 1808 by the horticulturist William Bradbery along the River Ebbsfleet in Kent. Historically important areas of cultivation also included Hampshire, Stamford, and Watercress Wildlife Site at St Albans. Watercress is now grown in several counties, most notably Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, and Hertfordshire. New Alresford in Hampshire is considered to be the nation&#x27;s watercress capital, and its railway, the Watercress Line, was named for this cargo.

<doc id="469647" wikidata="Q3326792" url="?curid=469647" title="Movement for Democracy in Liberia">
<text>The Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) was a rebel group in Liberia that became active in March 2003, launching attacks from Ivory Coast. MODEL was based on the Force Spéciale pour la Libération du Monde Africain (LIMA) militia formed in September 2002 to defend Laurent Gbagbo&#x27;s government against insurgents backed by Liberia&#x27;s president Charles Taylor. After fighting off the imminent threat, parts of LIMA crossed the border to Liberia to continue the war there. With Taylor&#x27;s forces already pressed against the larger Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), MODEL quickly gained ground. The initial leadership of MODEL came from LURD, while the majority of MODEL fighters were mobilized from Ivorian and Ghanaian refugee camps, to which many Liberians from the country&#x27;s Southeast had fled. 

The relationship between the rebel groups too was strained, with politicians from both movements uncooperative. MODEL was backed by the Ivorian government as a way of staking a claim in Liberian politics during the turmoil of that country&#x27;s civil war, or as retaliation for the Liberian government&#x27;s alleged support for rebels in Ivory Coast. Its political leader, Thomas Nimely, was named as Liberia&#x27;s foreign minister in the transitional government that was appointed on October 14, 2003, following the resignation and exile of Taylor. The group may have exported timber from regions of southern Liberia under its control, which would have been a violation of United Nations sanctions. By 2004 MODEL in effect ceased to exist.

<doc id="469653" wikidata="Q3943163" url="?curid=469653" title="Stephanie McIntosh">
<text>Stephanie McIntosh (born 5 July 1985) is an Australian actress, singer and songwriter. She played the role of Sky Mangel in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; from 2003 to 2007. She made a brief appearance for one episode in 2015 as part of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebrations, and returned again in 2020 as part of the shows 35th anniversary episodes, and a cameo appearance in 2022. As a singer, she released her debut album, &quot;Tightrope&quot;, in September 2006. It peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

==Early life and education==
Stephanie McIntosh was born on 5 July 1985 and grew up in Sydney, Australia. Her father is John McIntosh and her mother is Sue McIntosh (née Menlove), a former TV actress and ABC newsreader. McIntosh has two older sisters, Katherine and Olivia. Her half-brother is actor and singer Jason Donovan from her mother&#x27;s previous marriage to actor Terence Donovan.

McIntosh attended Firbank and then Melbourne Girls Grammar School, where she recalled &quot;I involved myself in every play and every musical and I did drama classes.&quot; She left during Year 12 to start her acting career. As a teenager, she worked in a musical with stand-up comedian and part-time dancer, Tommy Dassalo.

==Career==
===2001–2007: Acting career and &quot;Neighbours&quot;===
McIntosh&#x27;s acting debut was in the film &quot;The Wilde Girls&quot; (2001) as Carrie, alongside Olivia Newton-John. She followed this with a role on Australian children&#x27;s television show &quot;The Legacy of the Silver Shadow&quot; (2002). In March 2003, McIntosh signed a three-year contract to appear in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. McIntosh joined the main cast as character Sky Mangel. Her half-brother, Jason Donovan, had also acted in &quot;Neighbours&quot; from 1986 to 1989. Growing up, she was neighbours with Alan Fletcher and was invited to the set by him, prior to acting alongside him. For McIntosh&#x27;s performance in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, she was nominated for the &quot;Most Popular New Female Talent&quot; award at the 46th Annual &quot;TV Week&quot; Logie Awards held in 2004. She was also nominated for &quot;Favorite Hottie&quot; at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. After filming over 500 episodes, she left &quot;Neighbours&quot; in April 2007 to focus on her singing career.

===2004–2007: Music career===
McIntosh&#x27;s music career began in 2004 when her version of the song &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; was included on the album &quot;The Spirit of Christmas 2004&quot;. She recorded her debut demo single, &quot;Happiest Day of My Life&quot;, in March 2005.

In April 2006, McIntosh signed a multi-album deal with Universal Music Australia.

The two years that McIntosh spent making the album was turned into a reality TV show &quot;The Steph Show&quot;, produced by Tom Nichols and Arnon Woolfson. The show debuted on Network Ten on 28 July 2006, the day before the release of her debut single, &quot;Mistake&quot;, and finished on 15 September 2006, the date the music video for her second single &quot;Tightrope&quot; was released.

Her debut single, &quot;Mistake&quot;, was released on 29 July 2006 and premiered on Australian radio on 26 June 2006. It debuted on the ARIA Charts at No. 3, and was certified Gold in August 2006, with shipments of over 35,000 units.

&quot;Tightrope&quot;, the second single to be lifted off the album, made the Australian top 20. The album debuted and peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Charts and at No. 1 on the Australasian Charts and was also accredited Gold.

The third single, written by McIntosh, &quot;So Do I Say Sorry First?&quot;, was not as successful as her previous singles, peaking at number No. 34 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

A special re-packaged edition of the album &quot;Tightrope&quot; was released on 19 March 2007. At her appearance on Habbo Hotel on 8 March 2007 McIntosh confirmed that the re-packaged edition will feature remixes of the singles released from &quot;Tightrope&quot; as well as the bonus track &quot;Catching My Breath&quot;. She also confirmed that a second season of &quot;The Steph Show&quot; was in the pipeline. In mid-May 2007, she released her demo single, &quot;In My Skin&quot;. McIntosh was also nominated for &quot;Spankin&#x27; New Artist&quot; at the 2006 MTV Australia Video Music Awards, at which she also performed &quot;So Do I Say Sorry First?&quot;

McIntosh performed at university bars and nightclubs across the UK from September to November 2007 to build her popularity there.

=== 2008–present: Further acting roles ===
McIntosh was approached in 2008 to appear on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in Australia; however, she has not appeared in the series.

In May 2008, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; reported that McIntosh had been in Los Angeles, meeting with potential agents and managers. She auditioned for roles in &quot;&quot; (2009), the CBS mini-series &quot;Harper&#x27;s Island&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, but failed to secure them.

McIntosh appeared in the thriller &quot;Liars All&quot; (2013) as Casey Kass, and in &quot;Red Herring&quot; (2014) as Charlie, which co-starred former &quot;Neighbours&quot; castmate Holly Valance.

McIntosh reprised the role of Sky Mangel in &quot;Neighbours&quot; for one episode in 2015, as part of the show&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebrations. She was heavily pregnant at the time, and her return had initially been set up as a one-month role.

After a five-year acting career hiatus, McIntosh reprised her role on &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Sky Mangel on a recurring basis in 2020. Sky also appeared in the , broadcast on 29 July 2022, though McIntosh was not seen in the UK broadcast. She returned to Neighbours briefly on 3 July 2024.

== Personal life ==
McIntosh dated AFL star Nick Riewoldt for four-and-a-half years. They broke up in late 2009.

In March 2014, she began dating Peter Hieatt, a landscape designer. They have two daughters.

<doc id="469659" wikidata="Q4752799" url="?curid=469659" title="Ancient Anguish">
<text>Ancient Anguish, abbreviated AA, is a fantasy-themed MUD, a text-based online role-playing game. Founded in 1991 by Balz &quot;Zor&quot; Meierhans and Olivier &quot;Drake&quot; Maquelin, it opened to the public on February 2, 1992. It is free-to-play, but has been supported by player donations since 1994.

&quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; is based on a &quot;map-coordinate&quot; system rather than linked areas, which contributes to the immersive feeling of entering another &#x27;world&#x27;. Areas are then placed on the nearly 10,000 room &quot;map&quot; and tied into the geography and history of the fantasy world, called Oerthe. In addition, the mud strives for a &quot;describe-all&quot; policy for all areas, whereby any item/object/feature should respond to as many of the senses as possible, which adds to the immersive quality, although not all older areas conform to current balance and describe-all policies. It is noted as incorporating adult themes into its gameplay.

==Administration and site history==

In the early 1990s, most MUDs were housed on university mainframe computers, either illicitly or with tacit approval from the computer science department (many of whom played or created the games they hosted). In late 1993, &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; faced the threat of being shut down by the Swiss university that hosted the game, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, for excessive bandwidth usage. Hundreds of players made donations totalling more than US$7000 and bought a SparcStation 2 workstation, relocating the MUD to Washington, D.C.

At the same time, Zor (who functioned as God, or chief administrator, at the time) abdicated his singular authority over the MUD and turned over control to a newly created Senate of Wizards, with Amante serving as the Senate President. The Senate appoints Archwizards of Law, Balance, Quality Control, Education, Mudlib, World and Map, and Driver. The Senate consists of the Arch Wizards of the different functional administrations, plus additional Senators at large. In 1995, Amante abdicated his role as Senate President and the Senate assumed complete control over the MUD, and has continued to administer with 3 to 12 members who periodically change.

Over the next decade, &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; was hosted by a number of access providers:
* Mid 1995 to 1996: Pacific Rim Networks in Bellingham, Washington
* Mid 1996 to July 1997: Chaco Inc. in San Jose, CA
* July 1997 to Feb 2006: InReach Internet in Stockton, CA
* Feb 2006 to August 2008: LocalLink.net in Michigan
* August 2008 to December 2024: Colocation America in Los Angeles, CA
* December 2024 to present: Ionos.com in Philadelphia, PA.

Though its population has never been as high as some other MUDs, it remains one of the more popular LPMuds on the internet today, despite facing stiff competition from commercial and/or graphical MMORPGs. Ironically, &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; has been cited by original &quot;EverQuest&quot; designer Ryan Palacio as being heavily played by the &quot;EverQuest&quot; development team. It was also the basis of one of the earliest ethnographies of virtual worlds, and was further explored in a master&#x27;s thesis on the sociolinguistics of virtual worlds. The lead designer of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, Raph Koster, played &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; for inspiration creating &quot;LegendMUD&quot;. Various aspects of &quot;LegendMUD&quot; later shaped the design of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;.

==Development==

New code is continually added to the game by a team of volunteer &quot;wizards&quot;, or coders. Players can elect to become a wizard upon meeting three requirements: 1.) achieving a minimum of 1 million experience points; 2.) completing a number of the quests available; and 3.) earning a number of exploration points (sometimes called &quot;Gaius Points&quot;, after the sage who provides hints to guide players to find them). Players may elect to solve more quests and fewer exploration points, or more exploration points and fewer quests.

Exploration points are generally completed through exploration, prodding, touching, and otherwise investigating a given area or room, or completion of a mini-quest. The hints provided by the Gaius character are generally vague, and no direct statistic is available to players.

New wizards go through an educational process where they learn about coding enhancements for the game, develop an idea for a new area, and proceed to build it. The system was designed to provide guidance both to experienced programmers and those with no experience. These new areas go through a process of validation to ensure they meet the thematic, quality, and balance/playability requirements of the game, and are then opened to all players.

In late 2005, player levels were expanded from 19 to 50.

The game&#x27;s move to the Michigan server brought several changes: during the move, the old site was available in &quot;Anarchy Mode&quot;, a traditional experience when the game moved from one server to another, with all rules on player killing, multiplaying, wizard-mortal interference, and other guidelines of Law suspended. Since all player files had already been backed up prior to the move, none of this had any long-term effect on players and allowed them to &quot;blow off steam&quot;. It proved popular enough that the Senate considered hosting regular Anarchy events on an alternate port of the new server; the Anarchy port was used to host some parts of a mudwide competition called the AAlympics, for example. In addition, the move prompted a change from 25-hour mandatory reboots to 49-hour reboots, which were tested in late April and then made permanent. These reboots, common in MUDs to recover memory leaks and to clear &#x27;trash&#x27; items which accumulate, restore the world to a default state, leaving characters to regain equipment from scratch. All skills, stats, and gold are retained.

In May 2006, a new continent named Infidian was opened after several years&#x27; wait, nearly doubling the available landmass space on the map for areas and alleviating overcrowding of older areas on the main continent of Anguish (from which the game gets its name). Several areas were placed on its map already at the time of opening, and further ones discovered later to bring the number of areas on the new continent to 21. Infidian is reputed to be the historical homeland of the humans who came to Anguish, where the rest of the races already lived, and is nearly pacifistic.

==Gameplay==
On &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot;, a player can choose from multiple character classes to experience different play styles, including:
* Fighter: A hack and slasher, the best combat abilities.
* Mage: Mages have a large assortment of spells, and can specialize in multiple advanced schools.
* Ranger: Rangers are intrepid scouts trained in wilderness survival with many useful outdoor abilities. They are known for crafting, taming w wildlife, and raising puppies through selective breeding to be formidable companions.
* Cleric: Clerics are in contact with the gods, and call on divine aid.
* Shapeshifter: Magic users from another continent, they can assume different forms with diverse powers.
* Necromancer: Practitioners of black magic, poor at hand to hand combat but masters of dark rituals. They often animate the dead to do their bidding.
* Paladin: Stalwart and pure fighters, they are champions of the innocent and the weak against the evils of the world.
* Jaochi: Jacochi&#x27;s strive for perfection within themselves, and learn patterns with their own bodies as their weapons.
* Artificer: Artificers are expert crafters and enchanters of external devices and magic items. 
* Soulbinder: Soulbinders rely on touch to tie their energy to their target, and learning from opponents.
* Rogue: Despite persistent rumours, there are no rogues in &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot;.

Players become more proficient in different types of weapons after gaining experience using them. The more proficient they are, the more damaging weapons they can use. Fighters (who lack the powerful spells/special abilities of other classes) are able to skill more quickly than other classes, making them excellent at dealing damage. At the same time, a wide variety of non-combat abilities are available, including fishing, origami, pottery, prospecting, seduction, and weaving. There are also poker tables, several chess boards, and trivia games within the game.

===Guilds===
Players can join different guilds on the game, for social or adventuring-related benefits. Each guild has its own purpose and restrictions, along with a guildhall and guild-oriented chatline. These guilds include:

* The Knights of Drin are the personal knights of the king, Drin Trueheart. Orcs are not permitted to join, and most NPCs found in the guild&#x27;s home base of Nepeth will attack orcs on sight. Because of the martial focus of the group, only fighters, clerics, rangers, paladins, artificers, and adventurers are permitted to join.
* The Scythe are an anti-establishment group of barbarians and hedonists that deny access to anyone with a drop of elven blood. For classes, paladins and artificers are refused admittance. The Scythe formed as a result of opposition to the Knights of Drin.
* The Monks of Antana are a strong religious force for good. Dwarves and orcs are not permitted to join; neither are necromancers, due to their evil acts.
* The Courts of Chaos are a loosely knit cult that worship the forces of Chaos. Only the evil can join, therefore paladins are refused. Clerics on &quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; are not required to worship only &quot;good&quot; gods/goddesses (such as Antana), and are therefore welcome to join and worship the gods of Chaos. Fighters were not permitted for a long time due to a focus on spellcasting, but that has since changed.
* The Black Bear is a group of nature lovers, allowing all races to join. Paladins, necromancers, and rogues are not permitted to join.
* The Eldar, a coalition of elves, half-elves and humans. Any class is permitted to join, as the guild focus is mostly social. The guild&#x27;s purpose builds on the historical alliances between elves and humans, even during wars between the two species.
* The Society of the Raven is a band of cutthroats, brigands, footpads and other denizens of the night. Rogues of any race may join, but no other classes. Population has been light lately, due to a heavy crackdown by Law on stealing from players, one of the rogues&#x27; primary abilities, but the population does seem to be on the rebound, perhaps because recently, rogue theft and several in-game &quot;anti-theft&quot; devices have been &quot;rebalanced&quot; in favor of rogues.
* The Snowfolk guild is the youngest guild. They make their home far to the north on the Arctic glacier. They are fundamentally survivalists with a cheerful disposition and promote good natured attitudes. Their powers are based on the icy materials of their home. Necromancers and members of the Society of Killers are not permitted to join the guild. Most distinctive is that members are more resistant to cold and more vulnerable to fire.

==Technical infrastructure==
&quot;Ancient Anguish&quot; is based on the Amylaar LPMud driver and the Loch Ness mudlib, from the MUD of the same name.

<text>A whiteboard (also known by marker board, dry-erase board, dry-wipe board, and pen-board) is a glossy, usually white surface for making non-permanent markings. Whiteboards are analogous to blackboards, but with a smoother surface allowing for rapid marking and erasing of markings on their surface. The popularity of whiteboards increased rapidly in the mid-1990s and they have become a fixture in many offices, meeting rooms, school classrooms, public events and other work environments.

The term &quot;whiteboard&quot; is also used metaphorically in reference to features of computer software applications that simulate whiteboards. Such &quot;virtual tech whiteboards&quot; allow one or more people to write or draw images on a simulated canvas. This is a common feature of many virtual meetings, collaborations, and instant messaging applications. The term &quot;whiteboard&quot; is also used to refer to interactive whiteboards.

== History ==

It has been widely reported that Korean War veteran and photographer Martin Heit and Albert Stallion, an employee at Alliance, a leading flat rolled steel sheet supplier should be credited with the invention of the whiteboard in the 1950s. Heit and Stallion may have popularized and/or perfected whiteboards, but in reality the history of whiteboards long precedes them. A thorough examination of the invention of whiteboards reveals the concept was introduced two decades earlier by mechanical engineer Paul F. Born who installed one in a classroom in Elgin, Ill., in 1937. Born was the head of the district&#x27;s school board at the time.

Whiteboards became commercially available in the early 1960s, but did not become widely used until 30 years later. Early whiteboards needed to be wiped with a damp cloth and markers had a tendency to leave marks behind, even after the board was erased. 

In 1974, whiteboards were proposed as additional equipment for Soviet schools.

Dry-erase markers for whiteboards were invented in 1975.

Whiteboards began being commonly used by businesses in the early 1990s. They became more common in classrooms during the 1990s due to concerns over health problems in children with dust allergies and the potential for chalk dust to damage computers. By the late 1990s, about 21% of American classrooms had converted from chalkboards to whiteboards.

== Types ==

The first whiteboards were very expensive and were made of an enameled steel. Cheaper versions were then produced, including laminated chipboard, high-pressure laminates, and steel boards with a matte-finished or glossy white, usually polyester or acrylic coating. Enameled whiteboards, also referred to as porcelain and sometimes glass boards, have the advantage that markings can be erased completely; other materials tend to become stained over time. Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments, but in more demanding environments with heavier use, such as educational establishments, porcelain boards are considered superior.

Other types of dry marker boards are also available, such as high gloss vinyl and coated paper, which can be rolled up, high-density two-part high gloss paints, glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls, windows, and doors.

Clear marker surfaces, made of glass (matte or glossy) or specially coated acrylic, became available around the mid-2000s. They are generally manufactured from technical glass, e.g. for monitor screen filters, which is optically coated.

=== Adhesive whiteboards ===
Whiteboard material can be bought in rolls, sheets, and pre-formed boards. Adhesive whiteboards come in either a sheet or a roll and feature a stick back enabling the user to create a custom size board or project with the material. Although adhesive whiteboard material does not come in a thick, hard glass or painted steel plate, the melamine allows for a flexible material while preserving the high-quality whiteboard attributes of other surface materials. Adhesive whiteboards allow for custom projects such as dry erase wall calendars, whiteboard tables, cupboard grocery lists, indoor games for kids, and more.

=== Erasable marker ===
One type of whiteboard pen (also called a whiteboard marker or dry erase marker) was invented by Jerry Woolf of Techform Laboratories and later patented by Pilot Pen in 1975. It is a non-permanent marker and uses an erasable ink that adheres to the writing surface without binding to or being absorbed by it. Applications range from temporary writing with acetate sheets (for use with overhead projectors) to whiteboards and similar glossy surfaces. The erasable ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene, unlike permanent markers.

== Surface materials ==
There are six types of materials commonly used for whiteboard surfaces:

* Melamine
:: A resin-infused paper which is typically used over a substrate that can range from particle board to MDF (medium density fiberboard). Melamine boards range in quality primarily because of the amount of resin deposited on the base material. Some melamine boards remain clean (no ghosting) for a long time, others less so. Generally, this least expensive type of whiteboard is most commonly found in use in non-institutional applications. They are available in any office supply store. Performance varies widely. These boards are not suitable for heavy use, as in many educational cases, with time the paint erodes and the original surface reappears.

* Steel or aluminum
:: Painted steel and aluminum dry erase also have a wide range of quality. Painted surfaces tend to be smoother, which leads to better methods of erasing. The painted surface is generally a multiple layer of coatings made up of a base coat in color (most commonly white) and a clear performance coating that is the dry erase component. Paint varies from electron beam cured coatings to UV and other coating systems. Good commercial grade painted steel or aluminum has excellent dry erase properties and many will be able to have permanent marker cleaned from the surface. Any coated surface is susceptible to scratching. Painted steel surfaces are magnetic and allow the use of magnets. Painted aluminum surfaces are rarely used as a base for whiteboards as they are not magnetic and are more expensive than steel. Painted steel whiteboards are most commonly used for custom printed whiteboards. These products are used as tracking boards, patient information boards and tournament and training boards.

* Hardcoat laminate
:: Here again the performance varies over a wide range depending on the amount of resin used in the manufacturer. This category primarily uses melamine as its dry erase performance coat. Depending on the manufacturer (and the price) these laminates often are less porous and highly resistant to staining. Less common than other whiteboard surfaces, because they usually are used in combination with something else (a cabinet, doors or table tops for example). (This statement applies to Porcelain steel which is the only lifetime warranty available on the market)

* Porcelain, enamel-on-steel
:: Ceramic fired onto a steel surface in a kiln. They are the most durable surfaces, and most carry a lifetime warranty. They are very common in heavy-use industrial settings. They are highly scratch-resistant, although materials harder than glass, such as diamond, can scratch them. They do not absorb dry erase or permanent marker ink. They allow the use of magnets. The surface can be cleaned with any non-abrasive cleaner suitable for porcelain, then rinsed off with water to prevent smearing. Permanent marker can be removed using a polar solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol or acetone, or by writing over it with a dry-erase marker and erasing it.

* Tempered glass
:: Tempered glass is easier to erase. Most tempered glass white boards have no frame.

* Polypropylene film
:: Polypropylene film is temporary and uses static electricity to cling to existing surfaces. It works with dry whiteboard markers and wipes. Whiteboards are reusable and materials are recyclable.

<doc id="469662" wikidata="Q2296770" url="?curid=469662" title="Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh">
<text>Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1 August 1630 – 17 October 1673) was an English statesman who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1672 when he was created Baron Clifford. He was one of five leading politicians who formed the Cabal ministry between 1668 and 1674 in the reign of Charles II.

==Background==
Clifford was born in Ugbrooke, the son of Hugh Clifford of Chudleigh, Devon, and his wife Mary Chudleigh, daughter of Sir George Chudleigh, 1st Baronet. He was baptised on 4 August 1630 at Ugbrooke. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1647 and entered Middle Temple in 1648.

His aunt, Sabina Clifford, married Matthew Hals (or (Halse) of Kenendon. Their daughter, Anne, married Rev John Tindal and was the mother of Dr Matthew Tindal, the eminent deist and author of &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;.

== Political and public life ==
In April 1660, Clifford was elected Member of Parliament for Totnes in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Totnes in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament. He distinguished himself in naval battles, and was knighted. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Clifford served as one of four Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War (the others were Sir William D&#x27;Oyly, John Evelyn and Bullen Reymes).

In August 1665, Clifford was named Ambassador Extraordinary to Sweden; he traveled to Denmark in October, before returning to Britain the following February. He became Comptroller of the Household in 1666 and a member of the Privy Council. At the end of the Dutch war in 1669 he intrigued against the peace treaty, preferring the French interests. 

He was one of the five Counsellors who formed the Cabal, each of whom pursued their own interests. Clifford was known as &#x27;the Bribe Master General&#x27;. King Charles II entrusted for safekeeping to Clifford, his favorite aide, the British state papers of the 1670 Treaty of Dover, which &quot;led to war between England and the Netherlands and might have ended British parliamentary rule and the Church of England&quot;.

Clifford was created the first Baron Clifford of Chudleigh on 22 April 1672 for his suggestion that the King supply himself with money by stopping, for one year, all payments out of the Exchequer.
He was Lord High Treasurer from 28 November 1672 to June 1673, when, as a Roman Catholic, he found himself unable to comply with the Test Act and resigned.

He died possibly by his own hand (perhaps &quot;strangled with his cravatt upon the bed-tester&quot;) a few months after his retirement.

==Marriage and children ==
He married Elizabeth Martin, who died in 1709. She was the daughter of Richard (William) Martin of Lindridge House, Devon.
*They had fifteen children, eight of which were daughters:
#Elizabeth, born before 1655, died as infant.
#Elizabeth, born 1655, died 1677, married in 1673 Henry Carew, 2nd Baronet Carew of Haccombe. They had no issue (?).
#Mary, born 1658, died 9 October 1715, married in 1673 Sir Simon Leach of Cadeleigh. They had no issue (?).
#Amy, born 1661, died 1693, married in October 1681 John Courtenay (d.1724) of Molland, Devon. They had numerous issue, as the mural monument in Molland Church attests. No male grandsons resulted and Molland descended via their daughter Mary who married William Paston of Horton Court, Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire.
#Anne, born 1662, died 1678.
#Rhoda, born 1665, died 1689.
#Isabel Clifford, born between 1665 and 1669, died as infant.
#Catherine Clifford, born 1670, died 1708.

And their sons were:
#Thomas, born before 1652, died as infant.
#Thomas, born before 1652, died as infant.
#Thomas, born on 3 December 1652, died in 1671 in Florence, Italy.
#George, born between 1653 and 1662, died as infant
#Hugh, 2nd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1663–1730)
#Simon, born 1666, died ?, acceded in 1686.
#Charles, born 1671, baptized on 24 June 1671, died on 4 July 1691, buried in Ugbrooke.

<text>The cravat () is a neckband, the forerunner of the modern tailored necktie and bow tie, originating from a style worn by members of the 17th century military unit known as the Cravats. The modern British &quot;cravat&quot; is called an &quot;ascot&quot; in American English.

From the end of the 16th century, the term &quot;band&quot; applied to any long-strip neckcloth that was not a ruff. The ruff, a starched, pleated white linen strip, originated earlier in the 16th century as a neckcloth (readily changeable, to minimize the soiling of a doublet), as a bib, or as a napkin. A band could be either a plain, attached shirt collar or a detachable &quot;falling band&quot; that draped over the doublet collar. It is possible that initially, cravats were worn to hide soil on shirts.

== History ==

According to 1828 encyclopedic &quot;The art of tying the cravat: demonstrated in sixteen lessons&quot;, the Romans were the first to wear knotted kerchiefs around their necks, but the modern version of the cravat (French: &quot;la cravate&quot;) originated in the 1660s. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, King Louis XIV of France, enlisted Croatian mercenaries known for wearing a necktie called a &quot;tour de cou&quot;. The traditional Croat military kit aroused Parisian curiosity about the unusual, picturesque scarves distinctively knotted at the Croats&#x27; necks:

&quot;In 1660 a regiment of Croats arrived in France — a part of their singular costume excited the greatest admiration, and was immediately and generally imitated; this was a tour de cou, made (for the private soldiers) of common lace, and of muslin or silk for the officers; the ends were arranged en rosette, or ornamented with a button or tuft, which hung gracefully on the breast. This new arrangement, which confined the throat but very slightly, was at first termed a Croat, since corrupted to Cravat. The Cravats of the officers and people of rank were extremely fine, and the ends were embroidered or trimmed with broad lace; those for the lower classes were subsequently made of cloth or cotton, or at the best of black taffeta, plaited: Which was tied round the neck by two small strings.&quot;

Often the Dubrovnik poet Ivan Gundulić is credited with the invention of the cravat, due to a portrait hanging in the Rector&#x27;s Palace, Dubrovnik. The scholar depicted in the painting looks very much like the frontispiece to his &quot;Osman&quot; published in 1844. However, considering the hairstyle, this portrait is more probably a later portrait of his namesake Dživo (Ivan) Šiškov Gundulić, also a Dubrovnik poet. In their honor, Croatia celebrates Cravat Day on October 18.

On returning to England from exile in 1660, Charles II imported with him the latest new word in fashion: &quot;A cravatte is another kind of adornment for the neck being nothing else but a long towel put about the Collar, and so tyed before with a Bow Knott; this is the original of all such Wearings; but now by the Art and Inventions of the seamsters, there is so many new ways of making them, that it would be a task to name, much more to describe them&quot;.

During the wars of Louis XIV of 1689–1697, except for court, the flowing cravat was replaced with the more current, and equally military, &quot;Steinkirk&quot;, named after the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692. The Steinkirk was a long, narrow, plain or lightly-trimmed neckcloth worn with military dress, wrapped once about the neck in a loose knot, with the lace of fringed ends twisted together and tucked out of the way into a button-hole, either of the coat or the waistcoat. It was designed to be worn in deliberate disarray. The fashion apparently began after troops at the Battle of Steenkerque had no time to tie their cravats properly before going into action. The steinkirk was popular with men and women until the 1720s. Colley Cibber&#x27;s play &quot;The Careless Husband&quot; (1704) had a famous Steinkirk Scene.

The maccaronis reintroduced the flowing cravat in the 1770s, and the manner of a man&#x27;s knotting became indicative of his taste and style, to the extent that after the Battle of Waterloo (1815) the cravat began to be referred to as a &quot;tie&quot;.

<doc id="469665" wikidata="Q545060" url="?curid=469665" title="Earl of Strafford">
<text>Earl of Strafford is a title that has been created three times in English and British history.

The first creation was in the Peerage of England in January 1640 for Thomas Wentworth, the close advisor of King Charles I. He had already succeeded his father as second Baronet of Wentworth Woodhouse in 1614. The Wentworth Baronetcy, of Wentworth Woodhouse in the County of York, had been created in the Baronetage of England on 20 June 1611 for Thomas&#x27;s father, William Wentworth. Thomas was created Baron Wentworth, of Wentworth-Woodhouse, Baron of Newmarch and Oversley, in 1628, and Viscount Wentworth in 1629. He was made Baron Raby in 1640, at the same time he was given the earldom.

In 1641, he was attainted. His son, William, successfully had the attainder reversed in 1662, becoming the second earl, but died without heirs in 1695 when the barony of Wentworth, viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Raby according to a special remainder by his first cousin once removed, Thomas Wentworth, who became the third Baron. He was the grandson of Sir William Wentworth, the younger brother of the first Earl of the 1640 creation. While gaining the barony, he did not receive the Woodhouse estate, which was inherited by Thomas Watson, thereafter a source of rivalry between the two men.

In 1711, the earldom was recreated when the 3rd Baron Raby was created Viscount Wentworth and Earl of Strafford in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was created Duke of Strafford in the Jacobite Peerage on 5 January 1722. He was succeeded in 1739 by his son, William, the second earl. William had no issue and on his death in 1791 the Jacobite peerages, such as they were, became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining peerages by his cousin Frederick. As he also had no successors, all titles became extinct on his death in 1799.

The title was created for a third time in 1847 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, when the prominent soldier John Byng, 1st Baron Strafford, was made Viscount Enfield, of Enfield in the County of Middlesex, and Earl of Strafford. He had already been created Baron Strafford, of Harmondsworth in the County of Middlesex, in 1833. John Byng was the second son of George Byng (c.1735-1789), son the Hon. Robert Byng (1703–1740), third son of George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington (1663–1733). 
John Byng&#x27;s mother was Anne Conolly, whose mother was Lady Anne Wentworth, a daughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672–1739) (of the second creation). John Byng was thus a great-grandson of the 1st Earl of Strafford. John Byng was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Whig politician and held minor office under Lord Grey, Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell.

His eldest son, the third Earl, was a Liberal politician and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Under-Secretary of State for India. In 1874, twelve years before he succeeded his father, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Strafford. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was a clergyman. His son, the sixth Earl, was a County Alderman in Middlesex and Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Earl. He was the second but only surviving son of the Hon. Ivo Francis Byng, fourth son of the fifth Earl. the titles are held by his grandson, the ninth Earl.

Another member of the Byng family was the soldier Field Marshal Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy. He was the youngest son of the second Earl of Strafford from his second marriage. In addition to his military service, Julian Byng served as Governor General of Canada and had a hand in a major constitutional crisis that set important precedent for Canada and other Commonwealth Realms.

Family homes are divided up among its branches but Wrotham Park, historically in Middlesex but now Hertfordshire, and a 17th-century one-storey plus attic cottage in Vernhams Dean, Hampshire have become arguably established seats. Wrotham Park was named after the family&#x27;s original estate in Wrotham, Kent, which they sold.

The traditional burial place of the Byng Earls of Strafford is the Byng Mausoleum at Wrotham Park, not to be confused with the Byng Mausoleum in Southill Church, Bedfordshire, built for the burial of the 1st Viscount Torrington, seated at Southill Park.

<text>The International Society for Human Rights (ISHR) is an international non-governmental, non-profit human rights organization with Participative Status with the Council of Europe and is a member of the Liaison Committee of the Non-Governmental Organisations at the Council of Europe. The ISHR has observer status with the African Commission of Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. It has associate status with the Department of Public Information of the United Nations and Roster Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

The ISHR is seated in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and was founded in West Germany in 1972 as the Gesellschaft für Menschenrechte (GfM), with the aim of promoting international understanding and tolerance in all areas of culture and society and so was committed from its inception to only support individuals who share this principle and, consequently, strive non-violently for their rights. The initiator was Iwan I. Agrusow, a former Russian forced laborer, who had decided to stay in West Germany after World War II due to the treatment of former forced labourers in the Soviet Union (many of them were sent to Gulag upon returning).

The society became the International Society for Human Rights in 1982, with the founding of branches in Austria, Switzerland, the UK and France. Since then it has grown to include 47 National Sections, National Groups, Regional Committees and Affiliated Organisations worldwide.

Well known members of ISHR include West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, former Austro-Hungarian Crown Prince Otto von Habsburg, former Attorney General of Germany Ludwig Martin and Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu.

During the Cold War, the International Society for Human Rights focused mostly on human rights violations in the states of the Eastern bloc. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) declared the International Society for Human Rights an &quot;enemy of the state&quot; in 1975, and the Stasi launched a campaign against the human rights organisation, attempting to discredit it. Recently, the ISHR has focused on freedom of religion and freedom of press issues in countries such as Vietnam and China.

The Society publishes its own periodical Newsletter (in English) and in German &quot;Menschenrechte&quot;. The president of the International Council of the ISHR is Prof Dr Dr Thomas Schirrmacher. Karl Hafen is treasurer, Marie Gerrard, Dr René Gomez, Dr Liubov Nemcinova, Dr Haydee Marin, Simone Schlegel and Prof Dr Andrey Sukhorukov are vice-presidents.

Pepys had already been created Baron Cottenham, of Cottenham in the County of Cambridge, in 1836, and was made Viscount Crowhurst, of Crowhurst in the County of Surrey, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The viscountcy is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent.

<text>BPM 37093 (V886 Centauri) is a variable white dwarf star of the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, type, with a hydrogen atmosphere and an unusually high mass of approximately 1.1 times the Sun&#x27;s. It is from Earth in the constellation Centaurus and vibrates; these pulsations cause its luminosity to vary. Like other white dwarfs, BPM 37093 is thought to be composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, which are created by thermonuclear fusion of helium nuclei in the triple-alpha process.

==Structure==
In the 1960s, it was predicted that as a white dwarf cools, its material should crystallize, starting at the center. When a star pulsates, observing its pulsations gives information about its structure. BPM 37093 was first observed to be a pulsating variable in 1992, and in 1995 it was pointed out that this yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory. In 2004, Antonio Kanaan and a team of researchers of the Whole Earth Telescope estimated, on the basis of these asteroseismological observations, that approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. Any of these estimates would result in a total crystalline mass in excess of 5 kilograms. As the white dwarf has a radius of , this means that the core of BPM 37093, nicknamed &quot;Lucy&quot;, is likely one of the largest diamonds in the local region of the universe.
Crystallization of the material of a white dwarf of this type is thought to result in a body-centered cubic lattice of carbon and/or oxygen nuclei, which are surrounded by a Fermi sea of electrons.

==Nickname and press coverage==
*Since a diamond also consists of crystallized carbon, the star BPM 37093 has been nicknamed &quot;Lucy&quot; after the Beatles&#x27; hit &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*In John C. Wright&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Count to a Trillion&quot; and its sequels, V886 Centauri is called the &quot;Diamond Star&quot;, after the crystalline carbon core. In the story of the novel, it becomes the destination of the first human interstellar journey after it is discovered that the star, a ten-decillion-carat diamond of degenerate matter, is not matter at all, but antimatter. An alien artifact called &quot;The Monument&quot; is found orbiting it, which increases human knowledge of mathematics immensely.
*In Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;, Tilda Swinton&#x27;s character Eve tells Tom Hiddleston&#x27;s character Adam about BPM 37093, describing it as a &quot;diamond up there the size of a planet&quot; that &quot;emits the music of a gigantic gong&quot;.

<text>The Mirabal sisters ( ) were four sisters from the Dominican Republic, three of whom (Patria, Minerva and María Teresa) opposed the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo () and were involved in activities against his regime. The three sisters were assassinated on 25 November 1960. The last sister, Adela, commonly known as Dedé, who was not involved in political activities at the time, died of natural causes on 1 February 2014.

Of the sisters, Minerva was the one who had the most active role in politics, being the founder of the 14 June Revolutionary Movement together with her husband . Maria Teresa also became involved in the Movement. The oldest sister, Patria, did not have the same level of political activity as her other sisters, but supported them. She lent her house to store weapons and tools from the insurgents. They are considered national heroines of the Dominican Republic. Their remains rest in a mausoleum that was declared an extension of the National Pantheon, located in the Hermanas Mirabal House-Museum, the last residence of the sisters.

The assassinations turned the Mirabal sisters into &quot;symbols of both popular and feminist resistance&quot;. In 1999, in their honor, the United Nations General Assembly designated 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

==The Mirabal sisters==
The Mirabal family were from the central Cibao region of the Dominican Republic and had a farm in the village of Ojo de Agua, near the town of Salcedo. Their parents Enrique Mirabal Fernández and Mercedes Reyes Camilo were landowners in the area. All four sisters attended primary school in their village, Ojo de Agua, and attended a Catholic boarding school, El Colegio de la Inmaculada, for their secondary education in the city of La Vega. Once Rafael Trujillo took power it was customary to have a picture of him in the household, however, the Mirabal house never had a picture of Trujillo and were subsequently considered dissidents by the Trujillo regime.

When Trujillo came to power, the family lost almost their entire fortune. The sisters, especially Minerva, believed that the dictatorship was ruining the country, so they participated in the creation and organization of the 14 June Revolutionary Movement. Within this group, they were known as &quot;Las Mariposas&quot; (The Butterflies). 

Two of the sisters, Minerva and María Teresa, were imprisoned on several occasions in both La Victoria and La 40 prisons. They and their husbands were subjected to cruel torture during the Trujillo regime. Despite these facts, they continued to fight against the dictatorship.

===Patria Mercedes Mirabal Reyes===
Patria Mercedes Mirabal Reyes (27 February 1924 – 25 November 1960), commonly known as Patria was the oldest of the four Mirabal sisters. When she was 14, she was sent by her parents to a Catholic boarding school, Colegio Inmaculada Concepción in La Vega. She left school when she was 17 and married Pedro González, a farmer, who would later aid her in challenging the Trujillo regime.

Patria had three children. She once said &quot;We cannot allow our children to grow up in this corrupt and tyrannical regime. We have to fight against it, and I am willing to give up everything, even my life if necessary.&quot;

=== Bélgica Adela Mirabal Reyes ===
Bélgica Adela Mirabal Reyes (1 March 1925 – 1 February 2014), commonly known as Dedé, was the second daughter of the Mirabal family. Unlike her sisters, she did not go to college. Instead, she became a traditional homemaker, and helped her father with the family business. The Mirabal patriarch, Enrique, died after his political imprisonment, and Dedé took over the family finances. She did not become involved with her sisters&#x27; political work. After the murder of her sisters, Dedé took care of their children and raised them. Between 1992 and 1994, Dedé started the Mirabal Sisters Foundation and the Mirabal Sisters Museum to continue her sisters&#x27; legacy. Dedé was the last surviving sister of the family. She died at the age of 88, and professed her entire life that it was her destiny to survive so that she was able to &quot;tell their story&quot;.

=== María Argentina Minerva Mirabal Reyes ===

María Argentina Minerva Mirabal Reyes (12 March 1926 – 25 November 1960), commonly known as Minerva, was the third daughter. At the age of 12, she followed Patria to the Colegio Inmaculada Concepción. In 1949, the Mirabal family was invited to a party for the local elite where Minerva first caught the eye of Rafael Trujillo, so much so that the Mirabals were invited to a different party by Trujillo himself. At this party, Trujillo made more sexual advances toward Minerva. After Minerva&#x27;s rejection of Trujillo, her parents prohibited Minerva from registering for law school due to concerns that she would get involved in politics and ultimately be killed. However, after seeing how upset Minerva was, her parents relented six years later and she enrolled at the University of Santo Domingo, where she later graduated summa cum laude. Minerva was the first woman to graduate from law school in the Dominican Republic. Due to her previous rejection of Trujillo&#x27;s advances, when Minerva graduated, her diploma was stripped of her honors and her license to practice law was ultimately turned down.

At university, she met her husband, Manolo Tavárez Justo, who would help her fight the Trujillo regime. Minerva was the most vocal and radical of the Mirabal daughters. According to the theologian Nancy Pineda-Madrid, she was arrested and harassed on multiple occasions on orders given by Trujillo himself. According to the historian Bernard Diederich, Minerva Mirabal was arrested twice; she was first jailed in January 1960, at the start of the wave of repression of 1J4 members where &quot;hundreds of 1J4 members are rounded up and tortured&quot; She once said &quot;It is a source of happiness to do whatever can be done for our country that suffers so many anguishes. It is sad to stay with one&#x27;s arms crossed.&quot;

===Antonia María Teresa Mirabal Reyes===
Antonia María Teresa Mirabal Reyes (15 October 1936 – 25 November 1960), commonly known as María Teresa, was the fourth and youngest daughter. She attended the Colegio Inmaculada Concepción, graduated from the Liceo de San Francisco de Macorís in 1954, and went on to the University of Santo Domingo, where she studied mathematics. 

Later in her life, María Teresa dated Leandro Guzmán. While dating, before Leandro was allowed to hold María Teresa&#x27;s hand, she asked him how his family felt about Trujillo. Leandro responded, &quot;... there&#x27;s no problem. At home, that was the first thing I learned... to hate Trujillo.&quot; After this response María Teresa let him hold her hand and they eventually married after she finished her education. María Teresa was influenced by her older sister Minerva&#x27;s political views and was involved in the clandestine activities against Trujillo&#x27;s regime. As a result, she was harassed and arrested on the direct orders of Trujillo. She greatly admired her older sister Minerva and became passionate about Minerva&#x27;s political views. She once said, &quot;Perhaps what we have most near is death, but that idea does not frighten me. We shall continue to fight for that which is just.&quot;

==Political activities==
While attending the Colegio Inmaculada Concepción, Minerva discovered that her friend Deisi Ariza&#x27;s father was killed by Trujillo for opposing the regime. This event along with many others ultimately influenced Minerva&#x27;s fight against the regime. Minerva became involved in the political movement against Trujillo, who was the country&#x27;s official president from 1930 to 1938 and from 1942 to 1952, but ruled behind the scenes as a dictator from 1930 until his assassination in 1961. Minerva&#x27;s sisters followed her into the movement: first María Teresa, who joined after staying at Minerva&#x27;s house and learning about her activities, and then Patria, who joined after witnessing a massacre by some of Trujillo&#x27;s men while on a religious retreat. Dedé did not join in, partly because her husband, Jaimito, did not want her to.

The husbands of Minerva, María Teresa, and Patria were among the leaders of 14 June Movement, nicknamed 1J4. The movement was created in support, and then in honor, of the Dominican rebels who were killed while attempting to overthrow the Rafael Trujillo regime. Everyone in the family, including Patria&#x27;s teenaged children, helped distribute pamphlets about the many people whom Trujillo had killed, and obtained materials for guns and bombs to use when they eventually openly revolted. Within the group, the sisters called themselves &quot;Las Mariposas&quot; (&quot;The Butterflies&quot;), after Minerva&#x27;s underground name. The secret movement was discovered weeks after its founding leading to Patria&#x27;s house (where the group met) being burned to the ground and María Teresa and Minerva&#x27;s arrests.

In 1960, Minerva and María Teresa were incarcerated from 22 January to 7 February, then from 18 May to 9 August. They were not tortured thanks to mounting international opposition to Trujillo&#x27;s regime. Patria was never arrested but her husband and son were jailed. The three husbands were incarcerated in January at La Victoria Penitentiary in Santo Domingo, and then, in November, two of them were transferred to Puerto Plata.

In 1960, the Organization of American States condemned Trujillo&#x27;s actions and sent observers. Minerva and María Teresa were freed, but their husbands remained in prison.

==Assassination==
On 25 November 1960, Patria, Minerva, María Teresa, and their driver, Rufino de la Cruz, were visiting María Teresa and Minerva&#x27;s incarcerated husbands. Patria&#x27;s husband was not incarcerated but she went along for moral support. On the way home, they were stopped by Trujillo&#x27;s henchmen. The sisters and de la Cruz were separated, strangled and clubbed to death. The bodies were then gathered and put in their Jeep, which was run off the mountain road in an attempt to make their deaths look like an accident.

After Trujillo was assassinated on 30 May 1961, General Pupo Román admitted to having personal knowledge that the sisters were killed by Victor Alicinio Peña Rivera, Trujillo&#x27;s right-hand man, along with Ciriaco de la Rosa, Ramon Emilio Rojas, Alfonso Cruz Valeria, and Emilio Estrada Malleta, members of his secret police force. As to whether Trujillo ordered the killings or whether the secret police acted on its own, one historian wrote, &quot;We know orders of this nature could not come from any authority lower than national sovereignty. That was none other than Trujillo himself; still less could it have taken place without his assent.&quot; Also, one of the murderers, Ciriaco de la Rosa, said &quot;I tried to prevent the disaster, but I could not because if I had he, Trujillo, would have killed us all.&quot;

==Aftermath==
According to historian Bernard Diederich, the sisters&#x27; assassinations &quot;had greater effect on Dominicans than most of Trujillo&#x27;s other crimes&quot;. The killings, he wrote, &quot;did something to their machismo&quot; and paved the way for Trujillo&#x27;s own assassination six months later.

However, the details of the Mirabal sisters&#x27; assassinations were &quot;treated gingerly at the official level&quot; until 1996, when President Joaquín Balaguer was forced to step down after more than two decades in power. Balaguer was Trujillo&#x27;s protégé and had been the president at the time of the assassinations in 1960 (though, at the time, he &quot;distanced himself from General Trujillo and initially carved out a more moderate political stance&quot;). 

A review of the history curriculum in public schools in 1997 recognized the Mirabals as national martyrs. The post-Balaguer era has seen a marked increase in homages to the Mirabal sisters, including an exhibition of their belongings at the National Museum of History and Geography in Santo Domingo.

After the assassinations, the surviving sister, Dedé, devoted her life to the legacy of her sisters. She raised their six children, including Minou Tavárez Mirabal, Minerva&#x27;s daughter, who has served as deputy for the National District in the lower house of the Dominican Congress since 2002 and was deputy foreign minister before that (1996–2000). Of Dedé&#x27;s own three children, Jaime David Fernández Mirabal was the minister for environment and natural resources and a former vice president of the Dominican Republic. In 1992, Dedé created the Mirabal Sisters Foundation, and in 1994, she opened the Mirabal Sisters Museum in the sisters&#x27; hometown, Salcedo. She published a book, &quot;Vivas en su Jardín&quot;, on 25 August 2009. Its English edition is announced for 25 February 2025. She lived in the house in Salcedo where the sisters were born until her death in 2014, aged 88.

==Legacy==

On 17 December 1999, the United Nations General Assembly designated 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in honor of the sisters. It marks the beginning of a 16-day period of Activism against Gender Violence. The last day of that period, 10 December, is International Human Rights Day.

On 21 November 2007, Salcedo Province was renamed Hermanas Mirabal Province.

Hermanas Mirabal station of the Santo Domingo Metro is named to honor the Mirabal sisters.

The 200 Dominican pesos bill features the sisters, and a stamp was issued in their memory.

The 137-foot obelisk that Trujillo built in 1935 to commemorate the renaming of the capital city from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo has been covered with murals honoring the sisters. In 1997, the telecommunications company CODETEL (now Claro) sponsored a mural by Elsa Núñez. Every few years, the mural changes. 

In 2005, Amaya Salazar created one; in 2011, Banco del Progreso sponsored Dustin Muñoz to redo the mural.

In 2019, the southeast corner of 168th street and Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights, Manhattan  was designated &quot;Mirabal Sisters Way&quot; by the Council of the City of New York. In addition, there is a school campus in Washington Heights, Manhattan, Mirabal Sisters Campus.

In 2021, Rosa Hernández de Grullón, Ambassador of the Dominican Republic in France, inaugurated a plaque in Paris in honor of the famous Dominican resistance fighters murdered under the Trujillo dictatorship in 1960.

Being globally recognized as a symbol of social justice and feminism, the sisters have inspired the creation of many organizations that focus on keeping their legacy alive through social actions. An example of one of these organizations is the Mirabal Sisters Cultural and Community Center, a non-profit organization that seeks to improve the status of immigrant families.

<text>Earl Cowley is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1857 for the diplomat Henry Wellesley, 2nd Baron Cowley. He was Ambassador to France from 1852 to 1867. He was made Viscount Dangan, of Dangan in the County of Meath, at the same time as he was given the earldom. This title is also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Cowley was the eldest son of Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley, who like his son served as Ambassador to France. In 1828 he was created Baron Cowley, of Wellesley in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. A member of the prominent Wellesley family, Cowley was the fifth and youngest son of Garret Wellesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, and the younger brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley.

The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Coldstream Guards and fought in the Crimean War. His great-great-grandson (the titles having descended from father to son), the sixth Earl, served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from January to March 1974 in the Conservative government of Edward Heath. He was succeeded in 1975 by his uncle, the seventh Earl, who was the eldest son from the fourth Earl&#x27;s second marriage and the half-brother of the fifth Earl. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2016. As a male-line descendant of the first Earl of Mornington, he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles, which are now held by his kinsman, the 9th Duke of Wellington.

<text>The National Water Carrier of Israel (, &quot;HaMovil HaArtzi&quot;) is the largest water project in Israel, completed in 1964. Its main purpose is to transfer water from the Sea of Galilee in the north of the country to the highly populated center and the arid south and to enable efficient use of water and regulation of the water supply in the country. It is about long. Up to of water can flow through the carrier each hour, totalling 1.7 million cubic meters in a day.

The carrier consists of a system of giant pipes, open canals, tunnels, reservoirs and large scale pumping stations. Building the carrier was a considerable technical challenge as it traverses a wide variety of terrain and elevations. Most of the water works in Israel are integrated with the National Water Carrier.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
While preliminary plans were made before the establishment of the State of Israel, detailed planning began after Israeli independence in 1948. The construction of the project, originally known as the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan, started in 1953, during the planning phase, long before the detailed final plan was completed in 1956. The project was designed by Tahal and constructed by Mekorot. It was inaugurated during the tenure of Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and completed in June 1964 under Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, at a cost of about 420 million Israeli lira (at 1964 values).

===Agriculture, drinking water, Jordan&#x27;s share (1964-1990s)===
The National Water Carrier was inaugurated in 1964, with 80% of its water being allocated to agriculture and 20% for drinking water. As time passed, increasing amounts were consumed as drinking water, and by the early 1990s, the National Carrier was supplying half of the drinking water in Israel. It was forecast that by 2010, 80% of the output would be used for drinking water for two reasons: rapid population growth, primarily in the center of the country, and higher living standards.Under the 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace, Israel agreed to transfer 50 million cubic metres of water annually to Jordan.

===Since 2015 (after large-scale desalination)===
As of 2016, water from the Sea of Galilee was supplying approximately 10% of Israel&#x27;s drinking water needs. In the previous years, the Israeli government had undertaken extensive investments in water reclamation and desalination infrastructure in the country, while promoting water conservation. This has lessened the country&#x27;s reliance on the National Water Carrier and has allowed it to significantly reduce the amount of water pumped from the Sea of Galilee in an effort to restore and improve the lake&#x27;s ecological environment, especially in face of severe droughts affecting the lake&#x27;s intake basin in previous years. It was expected that in 2016 only about of water would be drawn from the lake for Israeli domestic water consumption, down from more than pumped annually a decade earlier.

==Route==
Water first enters the National Water Carrier through a several hundred meter long pipeline which is submerged under the northern part of Sea of Galilee. The water passes into a reservoir on the shore and then travels to a pumping station, initially called &quot;Eshed Kinrot&quot; or &quot;Eshed Kinnarot&quot;, later renamed &quot;Sapir&quot; (English name: Sapir Pumping Station) after Pinhas Sapir, co-founder of Mekorot in 1937 (see also Tel Kinrot for the site).

The pipeline entering the lake is composed of nine pipes which are joined by an internal cable threaded through them. Each of these pipes includes twelve concrete pipes, each five meters long and three meters wide. As these pipes were cast, they were encased in steel pipes, sealed at the ends and floated out onto the lake. A winged star-shaped cap is mounted in a vertical section of the underwater pipe to allow water to be taken in from all directions.

Water travels to the Sapir Pumping Station on the shore of the lake where four horizontal pumps lift the water into three pipes which subsequently join to form the &quot;pressure pipe&quot;, a long pressure-resistant steel pipe, which raises the water from -213 meters below sea level to +44 meters. From here, the water flows into the Jordan Canal, an open canal. This runs along a mountainside for most of its route. When full, the water in the canal is deep and flows purely by gravity apart from where two deep wadis intersect the course of the canal, Nahal Amud and . To overcome these obstacles, water is carried through inverted siphons.

The canal transfers the water into the Tzalmon Reservoir, a 1 hm3 operational reservoir in the Nahal Tzalmon valley. Here, the second pumping station in the course of the Water Carrier is located, the Tzalmon Pumping Station which is designed to lift water an additional . Water then enters the Ya’akov Tunnel which is long and 3 meters in diameter. This flows under hills near the village of Eilabun and transfers the water from the Jordan Canal to the open canal crossing which crosses the Beit Netofa Valley – the Beit Netofa Canal. The Beit Netofa Canal takes the water 17 kilometers and was built with an oval base due to the clay soil through which it runs. The width of the canal is 19.4 meters, the bottom is 12 meters wide and it is 2.60 meters deep, with the water flowing through it at a height of 2.15 meters.

The advanced Eshkol Water Filtration Plant, completed in 2007-2008 by Mekorot, the fourth largest in the world, is located at the southwestern edge of the Beit Netofa Valley. The water first passes through two large reservoirs. The first of these is a sedimentation pond, holding about 1.5 million m³ of water, which allow suspended matter in the water to settle to the bottom, thus cleaning the water. The second reservoir is separated from the sedimentation pond by a dam and has a capacity of 4.5 million m³. Here the inflow of water from the pumping stations and open canals is regulated against the outflow into the closed pipeline. The amount allowed through depends on water demand. A special canal bypasses the reservoirs allowing water to travel straight through the carrier. Before entering the closed pipeline, final tests are performed on the water in the carrier, with chemicals added to bring the water to drinking standards. At the end of the filtration process the water enters the 108&quot; Pipeline, which transports it 86 km to the Yarkon-Negev system near the city of Rosh HaAyin to the east of Tel Aviv and Petah Tikva.

==Alternative plans==
===Herzl plan===
The initial idea of a National Water Carrier followed the proposal of several solutions for the water problems of Palestine put forward before the establishment of Israel in 1948. Early ideas appeared in the 1902 book Altneuland by Theodor Herzl in which he talked about utilizing the sources of the Jordan River for irrigation purposes and channeling sea water for producing electricity from the Mediterranean Sea near Haifa through the Beit She&#x27;an and Jordan valleys to a canal which ran parallel to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea.

===Hayes plan===
An earlier water development scheme was proposed by Walter C. Lowdermilk in his book Palestine, Land of Promise, published in 1944. It was developed with human and financial assistance from the American Zionist Emergency Council. The book became a bestseller, and important in swaying the debate within the Truman administration concerning immigrant absorptive capacity and the Negev as part of Israel. His book served as the basis for a detailed water resource plan which was prepared by James Hayes, an engineer from the USA, who proposed utilizing all water sources in Israel (2 km3 per annum) for irrigation and the production of electricity. This would involve diverting part of the Litani River water to the Hasbani River. This water which would be further transported by a dam and canal to the area south of Tel Hai, from where it would be &quot;dropped&quot; to produce electricity. Water would also be carried from Tel Hai to the Beit Netofa Valley which would become a national water reservoir, of about one billion cu.m. volume (one quarter of the Sea of Galilee&#x27;s volume). An electricity generating station would be located at the reservoir&#x27;s outlet, from where the water would flow into an open canal to Rafiah, which, whilst travelling south would collect water from wadis and streams, including the waters of the Yarkon River. Hayes also asserted that the Yarmouk River would be channeled into Lake Kinneret, in order to prevent a rise in its salinity which could come about as a result of the diversion of the River Jordan, and that a joint Israeli-Jordanian dam about 5 km east of kibbutz Sha&#x27;ar HaGolan would be constructed. The Hayes plan was designed to be implemented in two stages over a 10-year period, but never materialised due to its economic infeasibility and lack of cooperation by Jordan.

===Johnston Plan===

Eric Johnston, the water envoy of US President Dwight Eisenhower between 1954 and 1957, developed another water plan for Israel, which became known as the Johnston Plan. In this, water from the Jordan River and Yarmuk River would be divided between Israel (40%), Jordan (45%) and Syria and Lebanon (15%). Each country would keep its right to utilize the water flowing within its borders, if it caused no harm to a neighboring country. Whilst this plan was accepted as fair by Arab water experts, it later floundered as a result of increasing tensions in the region, but was later seriously considered by Arab leaders.

==Tensions with Syria and Jordan==

Since its construction, the resulting diversion of water from the Jordan River has been a source of tension with Syria and Jordan. In 1964, Syria attempted construction of a Headwater Diversion Plan that would have prevented Israel from using a major portion of its water allocation, sharply reducing the capacity of the carrier. This project and Israel&#x27;s subsequent physical attack on those diversion efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967 Six-Day War. In the course of the war, Israel captured from Syria the Golan Heights, which contain some of the sources of the Sea of Galilee.

==Receding Dead Sea and sinkholes==
The surface of the Dead Sea has shrunk by about 33% since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is less than of water, compared with former flows of between and .

The water level of the Dead Sea had been declining, , at an annual rate of more than a metre, which is attributed to the battle for scarce water resources in the very arid region.

One effect of the shrinking of the Dead Sea is the apparition of sinkholes along its shores. The sinkholes form as a result of the receding shoreline, where a thick layer of underground salt is left behind. When fresh water arrives in the form of heavy rains, it dissolves the salt as it sinks into the ground, forming an underground cavity, which eventually collapses under the weight of the surface ground layer. At Ein Gedi for instance, on the western coast of the Dead Sea, a large number of sinkholes have appeared in the area, which have even damaged a highway segment built in 2010, supposedly to a &quot;sinkhole-proof&quot; design. 

The Dead Sea is further shrinking due to the diminished amount of water from the rains reaching it since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes.

<text>Destiny, sometimes also called fate (), is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. 

==Fate==

Although often used interchangeably, the words and &quot;destiny&quot; have distinct connotations. The earliest known mention of the term or its meaning is found on a document written in cuneiform script that reports on the mythical Tablet of Destinies. It probably refers to a political treaty between three groups of Sumerian gods (cf. the Epic Athra Hasis), whereby only the leader has the power to restore the things he once determined to their original state.

Todays traditional usage defines fate similar: as a power or agency that predetermines (rules) the attributes of a thing or set of events positively or negatively affecting someone or a group. Other possibilities are that of an idiom, to tell someone&#x27;s fortune, or simply the result of chance and events. In Hellenistic civilization, the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of chance gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, Tyche (literally &quot;Luck&quot;), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of Fortuna, with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers including Boethius, revived strongly in the Renaissance, and survives in some forms today.

==Western philosophy==
===Ancient Greek philosophy===
Philosophy on the concepts of destiny and fate has existed since the Hellenistic period with groups such as the Stoics and the Epicureans.

The Stoics believed that human decisions and actions ultimately went according to a divine plan devised by a god. They claimed that although humans theoretically have free will, their souls and the circumstances under which they live are all part of the universal network of fate.

The Epicureans challenged the Stoic beliefs by denying the existence of this divine fate. They believed that a human&#x27;s actions were voluntary so long as they were rational.

===Modern philosophy===

In common usage, &quot;destiny&quot; and &quot;fate&quot; are synonymous, but with regard to 19th-century philosophy, the words gained inherently different meanings.

For Arthur Schopenhauer, destiny was just a manifestation of the Will to Live, which can be at the same time living fate and choice of overrunning fate, by means of the Art, of the Morality and of the Ascesis.

For Friedrich Nietzsche, destiny keeps the form of &quot;Amor fati&quot; (Love of Fate) through the important element of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, the &quot;will to power&quot; (der &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot;), the basis of human behavior, influenced by the Will to Live of Schopenhauer. But this concept may have even other senses, although he, in various places, saw the will to power as a strong element for adaptation or survival in a better way. Nietzsche eventually transformed the idea of matter as centers of force into matter as centers of will to power as humanity&#x27;s destiny to face with &quot;amor fati&quot;. The expression &quot;Amor fati&quot; is used repeatedly by Nietzsche as acceptation-choice of the &quot;fate&quot;, but in such way it becomes even another thing, precisely a &quot;choice&quot; destiny.

Determinism is a philosophical concept often confused with fate. It can be defined as the notion that all intents/actions are &quot;causally&quot; determined by the culminations of an agent&#x27;s existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened. Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being &quot;given&quot; or &quot;decreed&quot; while determinism is &quot;caused&quot;. Influential philosophers like Robert Kane, Thomas Nagel, Roderick Chisholm, and A. J. Ayer have written about this notion.

==Psychology==

Among the representatives of depth psychology school, the greatest contribution to the study of the notion such as &quot;fate&quot; was made by Carl Gustav Jung, Sigmund Freud and Leopold Szondi.

==Religion==
The concept of destiny, fate or causation is prominent in most religionsbut takes different forms:

*The ancient Sumerians spoke of divine predetermination of the individual&#x27;s destiny
*In Babylonian religion, the god Nabu, as the god of writing, inscribed the fates assigned to humans by the gods of the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon which included the Anunnaki who would decree the fates of humanity
*Followers of Ancient Greek religion regarded not only the Moirai but also the gods, particularly Zeus, as responsible for deciding and carrying out destiny, respectively. 
*Some Christians believe that humans all have free will, while others believe in predestination.
*In Islam, fate or &quot;qadar&quot; is the decree of God.
*Within Buddhism, all phenomena (mind or otherwise) are taught as dependently arisen from previous phenomena according to universal lawa concept known as &quot;paṭiccasamuppāda.&quot; This core teaching is shared across all schools of thought, and directly informs other core concepts such as impermanence and non-self (also common to all schools of Buddhism).

==Politics==

Metaphorical expressions of a predetermined destiny are commonly used by politicians to describe events not understood. Otto Von Bismarck said that the best a politician can do is to &#x27;listen for God&#x27;s footsteps and hang on to His coat tails&#x27;.

In &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Leo Tolstoy wrote of the &#x27;unconscious swarm-life of mankind&#x27;, while Shakespeare spoke of a &#x27;tide in the affairs of men&#x27; in his play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

==Literature==
In ancient Greece, many legends and tales teach the futility of trying to outmaneuver an inexorable fate that has been correctly predicted. This portrayal of fate is present in works such as &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (427 BCE), the &quot;Iliad,&quot; the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (800 BCE), and &quot;Theogony.&quot; Many ancient Chinese works have also portrayed the concept of fate, most notably the &quot;Liezi,&quot; &quot;Mengzi,&quot; and the &quot;Zhuangzi.&quot; Similarly, and in Italy, the Spanish Duque de Rivas&#x27; play that Verdi transformed into &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; (&quot;The Force of Destiny&quot;) includes notions of fate.

In England, fate has played a notable literary role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606), Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot; (1957), and W.W Jacobs&#x27; popular short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; (1902). In America, Thornton Wilder&#x27;s book &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; (1927) portrays the conception of fate.

In Germany, fate is a recurring theme in the literature of Hermann Hesse (1877–1962), including &quot;Siddharta&quot; (1922) and his magnum opus, &quot;Das Glasperlenspiel,&quot; also published as &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; (1943). And by Hollywood through such characters as Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The common theme of these works involves a protagonist who cannot escape their destiny, however hard they try. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s graphic novel series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, destiny is one of the Endless, depicted as a blind man carrying a book that contains all the past and all the future: &quot;Destiny is the oldest of the Endless; in the Beginning was the Word, and it was traced by hand on the first page of his book, before ever it was spoken aloud.&quot;

<doc id="469697" wikidata="Q3507761" url="?curid=469697" title="Ivan Ranger">
<text>Johann Baptist Ranger (Croatian: &quot;Ivan Krstitelj Ranger&quot;, Slovene: &quot;Janez Krstnik Ranger&quot;; 1700–1753) was a Tyrolese baroque painter.

==Career==
Ranger was born in Tyrol. He entered the Pauline monastic order as a child. He started to paint very early and in its artistic workshops in northern Italy and southern Germany. Because the Paulist order paid particular attention to artistic and cultural activities within the order, he remained in Croatia from his twenties until his death at Lepoglava, decorating sacral interiors and producing one of the most remarkable Baroque opuses of Central European mural painting.

His paintings were stylistically original compositions. Ranger produced most of his opus in churches, chapels, and monasteries, such as in the churches of Assumption of Mary&#x27;s in Remete near Zagreb, in Lepoglava, in St. George&#x27;s in Purga, near Lepoglava, St. Helen&#x27;s chapel in Šenkovec near Čakovec, also the church of St. Jerome in nearby hilly Štrigova. The church of St. Jerome was the central site of the Order of Saint Paul the Hermit until the year 1786, when the order was abolished, causing the monasteries, churches and other premises to suffer great devastation. The order&#x27;s treasures, such as books and other valuables, were scattered or destroyed, its activities left to be lost in time.

Ranger&#x27;s frescoes were preserved on arched ceilings and walls over the 250 years since their creation. Ranger had enormous importance and influence upon his disciples and followers in the many works painted later. These characteristics are the illusionist painting of architecture, the recognizable typology of saints&#x27; figures, the colourist features and the incorporation of large compositions onto the relatively small and low walls of the churches. The Pauline order painting school of workshop continued in that way its activity in north-western Croatia long after Ranger&#x27;s time.

<text>Earl of Dudley, of Dudley Castle in the County of the West Midlands (though previously in the County of Stafford) is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, both times for members of the Ward family.

==History==
Dudley was first used for a peerage on 25 March 1341/42, when John Sutton became the first Lord Dudley of Dudley Castle. The male line failed at the 10th Baron, Sir Ferdinando Dudley, and Dudley Castle passed to his daughter, Frances Dudley, Baroness Dudley (1611–1697). She married Sir Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy goldsmith and jeweller to King Charles I (see Baron Dudley for more history of the Sutton family). Frances was given away in marriage by her grandfather Lord Dudley in order for him to be able to redeem the heavily mortgaged estates around Dudley, whose mineral resources were the foundation of the family&#x27;s great wealth.

In 1644, Frances&#x27;s husband Sir Humble Ward was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Ward, of Birmingham in the County of Warwick. In contrast to the barony of Dudley, which had been created by writ, this peerage was created by letters patent and with remainder to heirs male. Lady Dudley and Lord Ward were both succeeded by their son Edward, the seventh and second Baron, respectively. He was styled Lord Dudley and Ward. He was succeeded by his grandson, the eighth and third Baron. He was the son of William Ward. On Lord Dudley and Ward&#x27;s early death the titles passed to his posthumous son, the ninth and fourth Baron. He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, the 10th and fifth Baron.

On his death in 1740, the two baronies separated. The barony of Dudley, which could pass through female lines, was inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s nephew Ferdinando Dudley Lea (see the Baron Dudley for later history of this title). He was succeeded in the barony of Ward, which could only pass through male lines, by his second cousin John Ward, who became the sixth Baron Ward. He was the grandson of William Ward (d. 1714), second son of the first Baron. Lord Ward had earlier represented Newcastle-under-Lyme in the House of Commons. In 1763 he was created Viscount Dudley and Ward, of Dudley in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, the second Viscount. He sat as Member of Parliament for Marlborough and for Worcestershire. He was childless and on his death the titles passed to his half-brother, the third Viscount. He was also Member of Parliament for Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Viscount. He was a politician and served as Foreign Secretary from 1827 to 1828. In 1827 he was honoured when he was created Viscount Ednam, of Ednam in the County of Roxburgh, and Earl of Dudley, of Dudley Castle in the County of Stafford. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Lord Dudley was childless and on his death in 1833, the two viscountcies and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Ward by his second cousin Reverend William Humble Ward, the 10th Baron. He was the grandson of Reverend William Ward, younger brother of the first Viscount Dudley and Ward. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 11th Baron.

In 1860, the viscountcy of Ednam and earldom of Dudley were revived when the 11th baron was created Viscount Ednam, of Ednam in the County of Roxburgh, and Earl of Dudley, of Dudley Castle in the County of Stafford. Both titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1902 to 1905 during the Irish Reform Association&#x27;s plan for devolution in Ireland, and as Governor-General of Australia from 1908 to 1911. He is commemorated by a Dudley Street in the Queen&#x27;s Quarter of Belfast. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl of Dudley, who represented Hornsey and Wednesbury in the House of Commons as a Conservative. The Third Earl died in Paris on 26 December 1969. the titles are held by his grandson, the fifth Earl, who succeeded his father in 2013.

Several other members of the Ward family have also gained distinction. William Dudley Ward, grandson of Humble Dudley Ward, second son of the 10th Baron Ward, was a Liberal politician. He married the socialite Freda May Birkin. Their daughter Penelope Dudley-Ward was a well-known actress. Sir John Hubert Ward (1870–1938), second son of the first Earl, was a major in the army and courtier. His son John Ward (1909–1990) was a colonel in the Life Guards. Robert Ward, third son of the first Earl, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Crewe. Edward Frederick Ward (1907–1987), third son of the second Earl, was a group captain in the Royal Air Force. George Ward, fourth and youngest son of the second Earl, was a Conservative politician and was created Viscount Ward of Witley in 1960. The actress Rachel Ward and her sister the environmental campaigner Tracy Louise Ward are both daughters of Peter Alistair Ward, third son of the third Earl.
The family seat of the Earls of Dudley was Himley Hall until the 1830s, after which Witley Court served as the main residence along with Dudley House. Witley Court was sold in 1920 and became derelict after a fire in 1937. The 1st Earl of Dudley of the 1860 creation was originally buried in the crypt of Saint Michael and All Angels Church in Great Witley, but was later moved to Worcester Cathedral where he is commemorated with a large funerary monument. His more recent successors – including the 4th Earl and his wife – rest in a private burial ground at Himley. Located at the rear of Himley&#x27;s parish church, it is laid out as a memorial garden and normally closed to the public.

<text>Six ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Rodney&quot;, of which at least the last five were named after the Georgian Admiral George, Lord Rodney. A seventh was planned but never completed:
* was a 4-gun cutter in use in 1759.
* was a 16-gun vessel, possibly a brig-sloop, purchased in 1780, probably in the Caribbean, and in service in 1781. The French &quot;Rohan-Soubise&quot; captured her in 1782 at Demerara. In June 1783 she sailed for St. Pierre and Miquelon. She was struck from the lists at Rochefort in December, and from the Navy lists in 1784.
* was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1809, razeed to 50 guns and renamed &quot;Greenwich&quot; in 1827, and sold in 1836.

<text>Bonnie Francesca Wright (born 17 February 1991) is an English actress, filmmaker, and environmental activist. She is best known for her role as Ginny Weasley in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

Born in London, Wright made her professional acting debut in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), portraying the role of Ginny Weasley for ten years through &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011). Following this role, Wright appeared in a string of independent films, including &quot;Before I Sleep&quot; (2013), &quot;The Sea&quot; (2013), and &quot;After the Dark&quot; (2014); the films received mixed reviews. She made her stage debut as the lead in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; at the Southwark Playhouse in 2013.

After graduating from the London College of Communication in 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts in filmmaking, Wright founded her own production company, BonBonLumiere, and began to produce short films. Her first directorial project was the coming-of-age drama &quot;Separate We Come, Separate We Go&quot; (2012), starring David Thewlis, which was released at the Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. She directed &quot;Know Thyself&quot; (2016), starring Christian Coulson, and &quot;Sextant&quot; (2016), both of which featured landscape and emotion as themes. Wright&#x27;s three-part series, &quot;Phone Calls&quot;, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. She released &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Ankles&quot; (2018) starring Kerry Fox and Jason Isaacs, based on A. S. Byatt&#x27;s &quot;The Matisse Stories&quot;. She has also directed music videos for artists Sophie Lowe, Pete Yorn, and Scarlett Johansson.

Wright has gained recognition for her environmental activism; she is also an ambassador for the charities Greenpeace and Lumos.

==Early life and education==
Bonnie Francesca Wright was born on 17 February 1991 in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the second child of Sheila Teague and Gary Wright, owners of the jewelry company Wright &amp; Teague. Wright was raised a Christian. She attended Prior Weston Primary School and later the independent King Alfred School in Golders Green, North London for her secondary education. While on set, Wright kept with her studies with the help of a tutor, and attained three A-levels in art, photography and design technology.

She has stated that growing up on set contributed to her film knowledge and interest. During the filming of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; in 2009, she began attending the London College of Communication at University of the Arts London; in 2012, Wright graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in filmmaking.

==Career==
===2001–2011: Beginnings and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series===

In 1999, castings were held across the UK for &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling&#x27;s best-selling novel. Wright&#x27;s elder brother had read the first two books in the series and informed her that she reminded him of Ginny Weasley. Wright did not have any prior professional experience aside from school plays, and asked her mother if she could audition &quot;on a whim&quot;. She gained a screen test for David Heyman after her pictures were sent to the film&#x27;s casting directors, and her parents were told she got the role shortly after.
Wright made her film debut at the age of nine upon the 2001 release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, appearing in a cameo role in a scene at London King&#x27;s Cross railway station, where her character and mother meet Harry Potter during the boarding of the Hogwarts express. The film broke sales records and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. She reprised her role the following year in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, in which her character begins studies at Hogwarts and encounters a secret diary that begins to control her actions. One critic cited her role as &quot;important&quot; but &quot;underdeveloped&quot;. The film broke the opening records of its predecessor and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in the region.

In 2002 and 2004, Wright co-starred in two television films: &quot;Stranded&quot; (2002), a period piece, and &quot;Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures&quot; (2004), where she played the younger version of the titular writer. Wright had supporting roles in the successive releases of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, released in 2004 and 2005 to commercial success and increasing worldwide recognition.As Ginny, she appeared more prominently in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007), joining Dumbledore&#x27;s Army and eventually participating in the climactic scene, battling against Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Mark Adams of &quot;The Sunday Mirror&quot; wrote that Wright&#x27;s performance &quot;makes the most subtle and memorable impact... her time is to come.&quot; The film was a critical and financial success, with a record-breaking opening weekend. In 2007, Wright guest starred on the Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Replacements&quot;, where she voiced Vanessa in the second-season premiere titled &quot;London Calling&quot;. &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; was released in 2009. Wright&#x27;s character continued to develop, becoming chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team as well as Harry Potter&#x27;s love interest. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that her portrayal &quot;intrigues as the sort of initial plain Jane who keeps growing on you&quot;.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, Wright reprised her role for the final time, being featured during the film&#x27;s prominent battle storyline and in the epilogue, set nineteen years later. Wright was nominated for an Empire Award for her performance in the final film. She has also provided the voice of Ginny in the video game versions of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;. Wright is one of the thirteen actors who have appeared in all eight films of the Harry Potter franchise, being part of the cast members Rowling referred to as &quot;The Big Seven&quot;.

===2012–present: Independent films and directorial focus===
In 2012, Wright founded her film production company, BonBonLumiere. That same year, Wright made her directorial and screenwriting debut in &quot;Separate We Come, Separate We Go&quot;, a coming-of-age short film starring &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star David Thewlis. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012 and the Gold Coast International Film Festival  in 2013. Nick de Semlyen of &quot;Empire&quot; praised Wright&#x27;s direction, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s an impressive first work from someone who clearly has ambition to burn.&quot;

In 2013, she co-starred in &quot;Before I Sleep&quot; alongside an ensemble cast. The film was shot in New England, and premiered at the 2013 Heartland Film Festival. She then appeared in &quot;The Sea&quot; (2013), an adaptation of the John Banville novel, portraying Rose, a &quot;fragile, distracted young nanny&quot;. The film premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 23 June 2013. &quot;The Sea&quot; received mixed reviews; one critic wrote that Wright was an &quot;underused but ultimately ineffective screen presence&quot;. That same year, she also made her stage debut in the role of The Girl in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot;. The play was performed at the Southwark Playhouse in London from June to July. Wright received critical praise for her stage performance; the &quot;British Theatre Guide&quot; wrote she &quot;makes clear in her performance, she is motivated by love for her father and movingly has to face rejection...&quot; Wright filmed the comedy &quot;Those Who Wander&quot; and the family-adventure film &quot;Who Killed Nelson Nutmeg?&quot; in 2013. In December 2013, she directed Sophie Lowe in her music video &quot;Dreaming&quot;. The video was shot in Joshua Tree National Park. In 2014, she took part in the third series of &quot;The Great Sport Relief Bake Off&quot;, winning the first episode and being named the &quot;Star Baker&quot;.
Wright starred alongside Rhys Wakefield, James D&#x27;Arcy and her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Freddie Stroma in the science fiction film &quot;After the Dark&quot; (2014), directed by John Huddles and filmed in Jakarta, Indonesia. She portrayed Georgina, one of the students. The film premiered at Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival on 7 July 2013. Reviews for &quot;After the Dark&quot; were mixed; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; commented that the film &quot;slid[es] into a ... soapy backstory while suggesting that supporting actress Bonnie Wright might have been a stronger [..] lead&quot;. Wright voiced a character in the animated film &quot;My Dad Is Scrooge&quot; (2014). In May 2014, Wright wrote and directed short film &quot;Know Thyself&quot;, starring her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Christian Coulson. &quot;Know Thyself&quot; premiered at festival NewFilmmakers NY on 10 February 2016; &quot;Elle&quot; referred to the film as &quot;emotive&quot;. In July 2014, Wright directed the short film &quot;Fade to Gold&quot;, showcasing her parents&#x27; creative design of their jewellery.

In August 2016, her company released the first instalment of &quot;Sextant&quot;, a twelve-part work with each short shot under a full moon, containing themes of cosmic order and poetry. Wright stated that she desired to shoot &quot;when our sensitivities are heightened&quot; and that the film reflected her interest in how a landscape can be &quot;the catalyst..for self discovery&quot;. Wright&#x27;s next directorial project was a three-episode series entitled &quot;Phone Calls&quot;, showing phone conversations with three pairs of people who never physically interact on-screen. &quot;Phone Calls&quot; premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2017. In June 2018, Wright released &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Ankles&quot;, based on a section of &quot;The Matisse Stories&quot; by A. S. Byatt. The film was shot in Lincoln, England, and starred Kerry Fox as a woman experiencing a menopausal midlife crisis, alongside &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Jason Isaacs as a charismatic, &quot;self obsessed&quot; hairdresser with whom she develops a fraught connection. Wright stated that in her direction, she tried to capture &quot;the intimate experience&quot; of going to a salon and experiencing sudden, personal change. Wright directed Lowe again in her music video for &quot;Taught You How To Feel&quot;, released in November 2018. Wright also directed the music video for Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s single, &quot;Iguana Bird&quot;, an &quot;expressive personification of heartbreak recovery&quot;, released in October 2018.

Wright&#x27;s next video was for independent artist MAGUIRE, entitled &quot;Fallible&quot;. It was released in June 2019; &quot;Fame Magazine&quot; called it a &quot;breathtakingly candid portrait&quot;. In March 2020, Wright narrated an audiobook adaption of &quot;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump&quot; from &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;, an in-universe book of Wizarding World children&#x27;s stories written by Rowling.

<doc id="469705" wikidata="Q5326242" url="?curid=469705" title="Earl of Cromartie">
<text>Earl of Cromartie () is a title that has been created twice, both for members of the Mackenzie family. It was first created as Earl of Cromarty in the Peerage of Scotland in 1703 for Sir George Mackenzie, 2nd Baronet, but his titles were forfeited after the Jacobite rising of 1745. It was recreated in 1861 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for Anne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland (&quot;née&quot; Hay-Mackenzie). Since 1979, the Earl of Cromartie has been chief of Clan Mackenzie.

==History==
===First creation===

This branch of the family descends from Sir Roderick Mackenzie, whose elder brother Kenneth Mackenzie was created Lord Mackenzie of Kintail in 1609 and was the father of Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth (see the Earl of Seaforth for further history of this branch of the family). Sir Roderick&#x27;s son, John Mackenzie, was in 1628 created a baronet, of Tarbat in the County of Ross, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. He was succeeded by his son, Sir George Mackenzie, 2nd Baronet. He was a prominent statesman and judge and served as Lord Justice General from 1678 to 1680 and from 1704 to 1710 and as Secretary of State from 1702 to 1704. In 1685, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord MacLeod and Castlehaven and Viscount of Tarbat. In 1703 he was further honoured when he was made Lord MacLeod and Castlehaven, Viscount of Tarbat and Earl of Cromarty. In 1704, Lord Cromartie resigned his baronetcy in favour of his second son the Hon. Kenneth Mackenzie (died 1728), who was created a baronet, of Cromarty and Grandvale (see Mackenzie baronets).

He was succeeded in the peerages by his eldest son, the second Earl. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest surviving son, the third Earl. He supported the Jacobite rising of 1745 and led a force of 400 men from Clan Mackenzie at the Battle of Falkirk in 1746. Lord Cromartie was captured by government forces the same year and pleaded guilty to high treason before the House of Lords. He was sentenced to death but received a conditional pardon on 22 January 1748, on the condition that within six months he surrender all the rights of his estates as lord and forfeit his titles, which he did. His eldest son and heir apparent, John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod, fought alongside his father in the rebellion of 1745. He was also convicted of high treason and sentenced to death, but received a full pardon in 1748. He later had a successful career in both the British and Swedish armies. He achieved the rank of Major-General in the British Army, and was created a Count in the Swedish nobility, a title which was recognized by George II. In 1784, the Cromartie estates were restored to him by Act of Parliament for a payment of £19,000 (). Lord MacLeod died childless in 1789, and in his will he created an entail as to his heirs.

The Mackenzie estates were inherited first by his cousin Kenneth, nephew of the third earl, and then to Lady Isabella Mackenzie, eldest daughter of the attainted third Earl, married George Murray, 6th Lord Elibank. Their eldest daughter, the Hon. Maria Murray, married Edward Hay, younger brother of George Hay, 7th Marquess of Tweeddale. Edward assumed the additional surname of Mackenzie as required by the entail of Lord McLeod. Their eldest son John Hay-Mackenzie passed the estates to his only child Anne Hay-Mackenzie, who in 1849 married George, Marquess of Stafford, future Duke of Sutherland.

===Second creation===

In 1861, the titles held by Anne&#x27;s ancestors were recreated when she was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in her own right as Baroness MacLeod, of Castle Leod in the County of Cromartie, Baroness Castlehaven, of Castlehaven in the County of Cromartie, Viscountess Tarbat, of Tarbat in the County of Cromartie, and Countess of Cromartie.

As her children were already in remainder to the peerages of the Sutherland-Leveson-Gower family, the Cromartie titles were created with special remainder to keep them separate and in line with the Peerage of Scotland, in which females are able to inherit titles.
#to her second surviving son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, and the heirs male of his body (however, he had no sons);
#to each of her younger sons and the heirs male of their bodies (however, she had no further sons);
#to the said Lord Francis Leveson-Gower and the heirs of his body (meaning that the titles could descend through female lines if there are no male-line heirs);
#to each of her younger sons in priority of birth and the heirs of their bodies;
#to her daughter Lady Florence and the heirs of her body; and
#to each of her daughters in priority of birth and the heirs of their bodies.

Lady Cromartie was succeeded according to the special remainder by her second surviving son, Lord Francis, the second Earl. As Viscount Tarbat he had been sub-lieutenant in the Shropshire Yeomanry in 1876 and was later a Major in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders and served as a Vice-Lord-Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty. Lord Cromartie had no sons and on his death in 1893 the titles fell into abeyance between his two surviving daughters, Lady Sibell Lilian and Lady Constance (by regulation 3. of the remainder). The abeyance was terminated in 1895 in favour of the elder daughter, Sibell Lilian, who became the third Countess. In 1899, she married Edward Walter Blunt (1869–1949), son of Major-General Charles Harris Blunt, great-grandson of Sir Henry Blunt, 2nd Baronet (see Blunt baronets). He assumed the additional surname of Mackenzie in 1905. However, Lady Cromartie later discontinued the use of the surname Blunt. She was succeeded by her eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was also a Major in the Seaforth Highlanders and fought in the Second World War. From 1940 to 1945, he was a Prisoner of War. Lord Cromartie was also a member of the Ross and Cromarty County Council. In 1979, he discontinued the use of the surname Blunt for himself and his son and was recognized by the Lord Lyon as &quot;Cabarfeidh&quot; (Chief) of Clan Mackenzie. Since 1989, the titles have been held by his only son, the fifth Earl. As a male-line descendant of Sir Henry Blunt, 2nd Baronet, he is also in remainder to this title. He is also in remainder to the earldom of Sutherland, which can descend through female lines, but not to the dukedom of Sutherland and the subsidiary titles presently attached to it, as these can only descend through male lines.

The family seat is Castle Leod, near Dingwall in Ross-shire.

<text>Chris Rankin is a New Zealand–born British actor, director, and producer who is best known for playing Percy Weasley in the &quot;Harry Potter film franchise&quot;.

==Early life==
Rankin was adopted. Rankin lived in Rothesay Bay until he was six, attending Kristin School in Albany. He and his parents subsequently moved to Norfolk in the United Kingdom, where he attended Northgate High School in Dereham. His mother, Marilyn Rankin, works at a school, among other things.

==Career==
Rankin began acting at the age of eleven. He attended Shipdham Primary School, Northgate High School, and Dereham Sixth Form College. At Northgate High School he appeared in school plays of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot;. His professional acting career began when he won the role of Percy Weasley in September 2000 and he has since appeared in film, TV and theatre. In the Harry Potter series, he is a brother of Harry Potter&#x27;s best friend, Ron Weasley.

Rankin is the co-founder of a theatre company, Painted Horse UK. He re-appeared in the final two films of the Harry Potter film franchise, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, after his character&#x27;s absence from &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, and only a brief non-speaking role in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

Outside of the Harry Potter films, Rankin has also been seen in the TV mini-series &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; and Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot; in which he played Evelyn Wood. In 2002 he worked as an usher at UCI Cinemas.

On stage, Chris has played a variety of roles in pantomimes across the country, as well as Edgar Linton in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Eilert Loevborg in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, and Young Syrian in &quot;Salomé&quot;.

In 2009, Rankin starred in and produced a YouTube video titled &quot;LifeHack&quot;, directed by Thomas &quot;TomSka&quot; Ridgewell, in which he played a vigilante hacker who accesses people&#x27;s personal photos to find a missing woman. He also appeared as Mycroft Holmes in the Hillywood Show&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot; parody in 2016.

He completed his study at the University of Lincoln in 2011.

<doc id="469715" wikidata="Q727056" url="?curid=469715" title="Marquis de Custine">
<text>Astolphe-Louis-Léonor, Marquis de Custine (18 March 1790 – 25 September 1857) was a French aristocrat and writer who is best known for his travel writing, in particular his account of his visit to Russia, &quot;La Russie en 1839&quot;. This work documents not only Custine&#x27;s travels through the Russian Empire, but also the social fabric, economy and way of life during the reign of Nicholas I.

==Biography==
Astolphe de Custine was born in Niderviller, Lorraine. His family belonged to the French nobility and possessed the title marquis since the early 18th century. The paternal branch of the family also owned a famous faience factory. His mother, Delphine de Sabran, Marquise de Custine, came from the House of Sabran and was noted for her intelligence and great beauty.

Custine&#x27;s father and grandfather, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, both sympathized with the French Revolution but were both guillotined. Custine&#x27;s mother was imprisoned and barely escaped the same fate. In the aftermath of the overthrow of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror, the friendship of the marchioness with Joseph Fouché (who would eventually become Minister of Police under Napoleon) allowed her to recover part of the family fortune. Custine and his mother resettled in Lorraine in 1795.

Under the direction of his strong-willed mother, Custine was raised in an chaotic yet stimulating social environment. This brought him into frequent contact with noted intellectuals, among them Germaine de Staël and François-René de Chateaubriand, considered the founder of Romanticism in French literature. The marchioness purchased the château of Fervaques, near Lisieux, in Normandy, from the Duc de Laval in October 1803; Chateaubriand noted his visits there between 1804 and 1806 in which he discussed with both the marchioness and Custine in &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot;. Delphine died at Bex, in Vaud, Switzerland, on 13 July 1826.

Custine was given an excellent education and seemed to be headed towards a life in society. An income of 60,000 francs a year enabled him to live as he pleased. He owned an estate outside Paris, at Saint-Gratien, where on occasions he was visited by Frédéric Chopin. Custine spent time in the diplomatic service, attending the Congress of Vienna, and even accepted a military commission. Custine was at one time expected to marry Madame de Staël&#x27;s daughter, Albertine, but refused the match. In 1821 Custine married Léontine de Saint-Simon de Courtomer, following the wishes of his mother. The Marquis, who would later admit his homosexuality and live openly with a male lover, was nevertheless genuinely fond of his wife. They had a son, Enguerrand. During the marriage Custine met and established a romantic relationship with an Englishman, Edward Saint-Barbe, who moved into the house with the couple, and remained his life companion. In 1823, during the early stages of a second pregnancy, Léontine fell ill and died, aged only twenty.

On 28 October 1824, Custine&#x27;s life was irrevocably changed. That night, he was found unconscious in the mud outside of Paris, stripped to the waist, having been beaten and robbed. The attack had been carried out by a group of soldiers; with one of whom Custine allegedly had attempted to have a sexual encounter. However the exact reason for the attack was never proven. Nevertheless, news of the incident quickly spread around France — &quot;From this time on to the end of his life Custine would figure, in the cruel gossip of the day, primarily as France&#x27;s most distinguished and notorious homosexual.&quot; Even though the literary salons, as opposed to the society salons, remained open to Custine, many people who were friendly with him sneered at him behind his back. His diplomatic career was also cut short by this incident. A few years later, in 1826, several family friends would die, as well as Custine&#x27;s young son Enguerrand (born 1822), by his late wife, and his mother.

In the years after these tragedies, Custine became very pious.

Custine gravitated toward the Romantic movement and spent the next few years writing poetry and novels. Custine wrote one play and purchased a theater to produce it, but the play closed after three performances. None of his literary works received much attention. Heinrich Heine called Custine &quot;un demi-homme des lettres&quot; (a half-man of letters).

In 1835, an extremely attractive Polish count, the 23-year-old Ignatius Gurowski (1812–1887), moved into Custine and Saint-Barbe&#x27;s home in the rue de La Rochefoucauld to form a ménage à trois. Wrote Custine: &quot;He has an excellent heart, an original mind, is graciously ignorant of everything, and what settles it all, a charming bearing and countenance.&quot; The capricious Gurowski was not an easy guest, running up debts and seducing both men and women, but appears to have amused the couple. The detailed register of homosexuals, then maintained by the Paris police prefecture, and which termed Custine&#x27;s inclinations &#x27;frantic&#x27;, wrote of Gurowski with a comical note of possible despair: &quot;It is hereditary in his family: his father and grandfather were of the same religion.&quot; In 1841 Gurowski married a Spanish infanta, Isabella Ferdinanda de Bourbon.

==&quot;La Russie en 1839&quot;==

Custine eventually discovered that his knack was for travel writing. He wrote a decently received account of a trip to Spain and was encouraged by Honoré de Balzac to write accounts of other &quot;half-European&quot; parts of Europe, like southern Italy and Russia. In the late 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; appeared, whose last chapter contained the prophecy that the future belonged to Russia and America. Inspired by Tocqueville&#x27;s work, Custine decided that Russia would be the subject of his next writing effort. Custine was later dubbed by some historians as &quot;the de Tocqueville of Russia&quot;.

Custine visited Russia in 1839, spending most of his time in St. Petersburg, but also visiting Moscow and Yaroslavl. A political reactionary in his own country, fearful that democracy would inevitably lead to mob rule, he went to Russia looking for arguments against representative government, but he was appalled by autocracy as practiced in Russia and equally by the Russian people&#x27;s apparent collaboration in their own oppression. He attributed this state of affairs to what he saw as the backwardness of the Russian Orthodox Church, combined with the disastrous effects of the Mongol invasion of medieval Russia, and the policies of Peter the Great. 

Most of Custine&#x27;s mockery was reserved for the Russian nobility and Nicholas I. Custine said that Russia&#x27;s aristocracy had &quot;just enough of the gloss of European civilization to be &#x27;spoiled as savages&#x27; but not enough to become cultivated men. They were like &#x27;trained bears who made you long for the wild ones.&#x27;&quot; Custine criticized Tsar Nicholas for the constant spying he ordered and for repressing Poland (see November Uprising). Custine had more than one conversation with the Tsar and concluded it was possible that the Tsar behaved as he did only because he felt he had to. &quot;If the Emperor has no more of mercy in his heart than he reveals in his policies, then I pity Russia; if, on the other hand, his true sentiments are really superior to his acts, then I pity the Emperor&quot; (Kennan 76). 

According to Kennan, Custine saw Russia as a horrible domain of obsequious flattery of the Tsar and spying. Custine said the air felt freer the moment one crossed into Prussia. In the mid-20th century, many commentators drew parallels between Custine&#x27;s description of Russia and contemporary Soviet Union as well as noticing many similarities between his character outline of Nicholas I and Joseph Stalin.

===Publication and reaction===
&quot;La Russie en 1839&quot;, first published in full in 1843, went through six printings and was widely read in England, France, and Germany but banned in Russia, where it was not published in an unabridged version until 1996. Nonetheless, several Russian authors published works critical of it. Tsarist authorities also sponsored a more scholarly investigation of Russia by a foreigner, August von Haxthausen, who authored the &quot;Studies on the Interior of Russia&quot;. This work can be interpreted as an attempt to provide an objective research of Russia&#x27;s traditional social institutions, which the Tsar&#x27;s advisors believed would effectively counter Custine&#x27;s work. The Tsar also commissioned the French writer Hippolyte Auger to pen an extensive refutation. However, as the scandal of Custine&#x27;s work had subsided by then, the Tsar decided it was best not to remind the public of the book, and the project was abandoned.

==Death==
Custine died of a stroke in the evening of 25 September 1857.

==Legacy==

Custine&#x27;s observations in &quot;La Russie en 1839&quot; continue to be admired for their insight, prescience and sheer entertainment value, but are also disliked by others for reasons that can include the belief they are inaccurate, pretentious, racist, and that the idea of national stereotypes is an absurdity. It has been suggested that he is one of the originators of a putative West European Russophobia.

However, as one critic has written, what is indisputable is that &quot;Above all, the Marquis valued freedom; freedom from fear, hypocrisy and the shackles that restrain the human spirit.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Sergey Dreyden stars as a character representing Custine in the 2002 film &quot;Russian Ark&quot;. His conversations with the time-travelling narrator are intended to reflect Russia&#x27;s continued struggle to search for its own identity and define its relations vis-à-vis Europe.

<text>The Franklin Center is a 60-story supertall skyscraper in the Loop neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Completed in 1989 as the AT&amp;T Corporate Center to consolidate the central region headquarters of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), it stands at a height of and contains of floor space. It is located two blocks east of the Chicago River and northeast of the Willis Tower with a main address of 227 West Monroe Street and an alternate address of 100 South Franklin Street.

The building is the tallest constructed in Chicago in the last quarter of the 20th century. It is the 6th tallest building in Chicago and the 23rd tallest in the United States. It contains office and retail space and a 350-space garage.

Tishman Speyer acquired the property in 2004 and renamed the adjacent USG Building as Franklin Center in 2007 after USG relocated its offices. The name was later applied to the entire complex.

==History==
A 1982 consent decree split the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company monopoly into several entities with local service providers becoming part of a Regional Bell Operating Company. In the decade that followed, AT&amp;T erected new buildings across the country including the AT&amp;T Building in New York City. April 5, 1985, AT&amp;T issued a request for proposals that produced eleven respondents. Stein and Co., the winning realtor, sought Skidmore, Owings and Merrill as designers for the purpose of distinguishing a proposal from the nearby Willis Tower. AT&amp;T employees began to occupy the office space April 3, 1989.

The building was built under a self-imposed comprehensive minority contracting and affirmative action package that met the city&#x27;s 1985 30% hiring rule for public sector projects. Chicago mayor Harold Washington&#x27;s administration issued a directive that 30% of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women-owned businesses. In a show of support for this rule, Stein &amp; Co. and AT&amp;T adopted the rule for its private development.

==Architecture==

Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the Franklin Center is one of the most famous and recognized buildings in Chicago. The building&#x27;s form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building&#x27;s verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.

===Interior===
The Otis elevators are spanned by a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT&amp;T and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.

===Features===
The building features a lobby-level 650-seat restaurant, a retail concourse on two levels, and a 170-car 24-hour parking facility on the lower two levels. The building lobby extends all the way through the block to connect with the USG Building and an atrium links the two structures.

==Exterior lighting==
As with other downtown buildings, the tower&#x27;s setbacks and spires are accented by colored lights at night. The building&#x27;s managers were praised for dimming their lights during bird migrations, reducing bird mortality 80%.

==USG Building==

The USG Corporation developed the 35-story structure originally known as the USG Building as its corporate headquarters building immediately adjacent to and connected to the AT&amp;T Corporate Center in 1992. Located at 125 South Franklin Street, the same developers, architects and design teams were chosen, and the two buildings were built jointly as a block-long complex on an site. They share a 16-story atrium which houses a grand arcade and serves as a common base to the two separate towers. When USG Corporation moved to a new facility in 2007, the building was renamed Franklin Center.

==Proximity to transit==
Positioned near the southwest corner of the Loop, the building is near two elevated stations of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;. The Quincy station is one block to the south and the Washington and Wells station is located two blocks to the north, both on Wells Street. Union Station stands three blocks to the west on Jackson Boulevard, providing terminal service for Amtrak and select service for Metra. Additional Metra service is provided at the LaSalle Street Station, four blocks to the south and Ogilvie Transportation Center station four blocks to the north-west.

==Position in Chicago&#x27;s skyline (2006)==
The Center is the 6th tallest completed building in Chicago, trailing the Willis Tower, Aon Center, John Hancock Center, and Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago) in height. (The latter is not pictured below, as it was constructed after the image was produced.)

The Center&#x27;s official height measurement increased to from to when the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat changed measurement conventions to include ornamental spires during the Willis Tower–Petronas Tower height controversy.

<text>Earl of Lytton, in the County of Derby, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1880 for the diplomat and poet Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Baron Lytton. He was Viceroy of India from 1876 to 1880 and British Ambassador to France from 1887 to 1891. He was made Viscount Knebworth, of Knebworth in the County of Hertford, at the same time he was given the earldom, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
Robert Bulwer-Lytton was the son of the poet, novelist and politician Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, and his wife, the novelist Rosina Doyle Wheeler. Edward was the author of numerous popular novels, poems and dramas and also served as Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Earl of Derby between 1858 and 1859. Born Edward Bulwer, he was the third and youngest son of General William Earle Bulwer and his wife Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire (through which marriage the Knebworth estate came into the Bulwer family). He was created a Baronet, of Knebworth House in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, in 1838, and in 1866, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Lytton, of Knebworth in the County of Hertford. In 1844, he also assumed by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Lytton.

The first Earl of Lytton was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was also a politician and served as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1920 to 1922 and as Governor of Bengal from 1922 to 1927. Lord Lytton married Pamela Plowden, remembered as the first great love of Winston Churchill. Their two sons, Antony Bulwer-Lytton, Viscount Knebworth, and Alexander Bulwer-Lytton, Viscount Knebworth, both predeceased them, Antony killed in a plane crash in 1933 and Alexander killed in action in World War II. Their daughter, Lady Hermione Lytton, married Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold, and through this marriage Knebworth House passed to the Cobbold family (see the Baron Cobbold).

Lord Lytton was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a portrait and landscape painter. In 1899 he married Judith Blunt, 16th Baroness Wentworth, the renowned horse breeder who devoted her life to the Crabbet Arabian Stud. The stud had been created by her parents, the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and his wife Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth, granddaughter of Lord Byron through his daughter Ada Lovelace (see the Baron Wentworth for earlier history of this title). They were divorced in 1923.

Lord Lytton and Lady Wentworth were succeeded, respectively, in 1951 and 1957 by their son Noel Lytton, 4th Earl of Lytton; as a consequence the title Baron Wentworth, in the Peerage of England, became subsidiary to the Earldom of Lytton. He assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Milbanke in 1925, but discontinued by deed poll the use of this surname in 1951. the titles are held by his eldest son, the fifth Earl, who succeeded in 1985.

Another member of the family was the Liberal politician, diplomat and writer Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer. He was the elder brother of the first Baron Lytton.

The family seat is Newbuildings Place, near Shipley, West Sussex.

<doc id="469727" wikidata="Q359044" url="?curid=469727" title="Income–consumption curve">
<text>In economics and particularly in consumer choice theory, the income-consumption curve (also called income expansion path and income offer curve) is a curve in a graph in which the quantities of two goods are plotted on the two axes; the curve is the locus of points showing the consumption bundles chosen at each of various levels of income.

The income effect in economics can be defined as the change in consumption resulting from a change in real income. This income change can come from one of two sources: from external sources, or from income being freed up (or soaked up) by a decrease (or increase) in the price of a good that money is being spent on. The effect of the former type of change in available income is depicted by the income-consumption curve discussed in the remainder of this article, while the effect of the freeing-up of existing income by a price drop is discussed along with its companion effect, the substitution effect, in the article on the latter.
For example, if a consumer spends one-half of his or her income on bread alone, a fifty-percent decrease in the price of bread will increase the free money available to him or her by the same amount which he or she can spend in buying more bread or something else

The consumer&#x27;s preferences, monetary income and prices play an important role in solving the consumer&#x27;s optimization problem (choosing how much of various goods to consume so as to maximize their utility subject to a budget constraint). The comparative statics of consumer behavior investigates the effects of changes in the exogenous or independent variables (especially prices and money incomes of the consumers) on the chosen values of the endogenous or dependent variables (the consumer&#x27;s demands for the goods). When the income of the consumer rises with the prices held constant, the optimal bundle chosen by the consumer changes as the feasible set available to them changes. The income–consumption curve is the set of tangency points of indifference curves with the various budget constraint lines, with prices held constant, as income increases shifting the budget constraint out.

==Consumer theory==
The income effect is a phenomenon observed through changes in purchasing power. It reveals the change in quantity demanded brought by a change in real income. The figure 1 on the left shows the consumption patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 respectively. The initial bundle X*, is the bundle which is chosen by the consumer on the budget line B1. An increase in the money income of the consumer, with &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 constant, will shift the budget line outward parallel to itself.

In the figure, this means that the change in the money income of the consumer will shift the budget line B1 outward parallel to itself to B2 where the bundle X&#x27; bundle will be chosen. Again, an increase in the money income of the consumer will push the budget line B2 outward parallel to itself to B3 where the bundle X&quot; will be the bundle which will be chosen. Thus, it can be said that, with variations in income of the consumers and with the prices held constant the income–consumption curve can be traced out as the set of optimal points.

==For different types of goods==

In the case illustrated with the help of Figure 1 both X1 and X2 are normal goods in which case, the demand for the good increases as money income rises. However, if the consumer has different preferences, he has the option to choose X0 or X+ on budget line B2. As the income of the consumer rises, and the consumer chooses X0 instead of X&#x27; i.e. if the consumer&#x27;s indifference curve is I4 and not I2, then the demand for X1 would fall . In that case, X1 would be called an inferior good i.e. demand for good X1 decreases with a rise in income of the consumer. Thus, a rise in income of the consumer may lead his demand for a good to rise, fall or not change at all. It is important to note here that, the knowledge of preferences of the consumer is essential to predict whether a particular good is inferior or normal.

===Normal goods===

In the figure 2 to the left, B1, B2 and B3 are the different budget lines and I1, I2 and I3 are the indifference curves that are available to the consumer. As shown earlier, as the income of the consumer rises, the budget line moves outwards parallel to itself. In this case, from initial bundle X*, with an increase in the income of the consumer the budget line moves from B1 to B2 and the consumer would choose X&#x27; bundle and subsequently, with a further rise in consumer&#x27;s income the budget line moves from B2 to B3 and the consumer would choose X&quot; bundle and so on. The consumer would thus maximize his utility at the points X*, X&#x27; and X&quot;, and by joining these points, the income-consumption curve can be obtained.

===Inferior goods===

The figure on the right (figure 3), shows the consumption patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 respectively, where B1 and B2 are the budget lines and I1 and I2 are the indifference curves. Figure 3 clearly shows that, with a rise in the income of the consumer, the initial budget line B1 moves outward parallel to itself to B2 and the consumer now chooses X&#x27; bundle to the initial bundle X*. The figure shows that, the demand for X2 has risen from X21 to X22 with an outward shift of the budget line from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.

In contrast, it is to be noted from the figure, that the demand for X1 has fallen from X11 to X12 with an outward shift of the budget line from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This implies that, good X1 is an inferior good as the demand for X1 fell with an increase in the income of the consumer.

The consumer maximizes his utility at points X* and X&#x27; and by joining these points, the income–consumption curve can be obtained. In figure 3, the income–consumption curve bends back on itself as with an increase income, the consumer demands more of X2 and less of X1. The income–consumption curve in this case is negatively sloped and the income elasticity of demand will be negative. Also the price effect for X2 is positive, while it is negative for X1.

formula_1 is the change in the demand for good 1 when we change income from formula_2 to formula_3, holding the price of good 1 fixed at formula_4:

formula_5

<text>The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is a commodity futures exchange owned and operated by CME Group of Chicago. NYMEX is located at One North End Avenue in Brookfield Place in the Battery Park City section of Manhattan, New York City.

The company&#x27;s two principal divisions are the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX), once separately owned exchanges. NYMEX traces its history to 1882 and for most of its history, as was common of exchanges, it was owned by the members who traded there. Later, NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the former parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and COMEX, went public and became listed on the New York Stock Exchange on November 17, 2006, under the ticker symbol NMX. On March 17, 2008, Chicago based CME Group signed a definitive agreement to acquire NYMEX Holdings, Inc. for $11.2 billion in cash and stock and the takeover was completed in August 2008. Both NYMEX and COMEX now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group. The other two designated contract markets in the CME Group are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.

The New York Mercantile Exchange handles billions of dollars&#x27; worth of oil transactions, energy carriers, metals, and other commodities being bought and sold on the trading floor and the overnight electronic trading computer systems for future delivery. The prices quoted for transactions on the exchange are the basis for prices that people pay for various commodities throughout the world.

The floor of the NYMEX is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an independent agency of the United States government. Each individual company that trades on the exchange must send its own independent brokers. Therefore, a few employees on the floor of the exchange represent a big corporation and the exchange employees only record the transactions and have nothing to do with the actual trade.

Although mostly electronic since 2006, the NYMEX maintained a small venue, or &quot;pit&quot;, that still practiced the open outcry trading system, in which traders employed shouting and complex hand gestures on the physical trading floor. A project to preserve the hand signals used at NYMEX has been published. 
NYMEX closed the pit permanently at the end of trading Friday, December 30, 2016, because of shrinking volume.

==Early history ==
Commodity exchanges began in the middle of the 19th century, when businessmen began organizing market forums to make buying and selling of commodities easier. These marketplaces provided a place for buyers and sellers to set the quality, standards, and establish rules of business. By the late 19th century there were about 1,600 marketplaces at ports and railroad stations. In 1872, a group of Manhattan dairy merchants got together and created the Butter and Cheese Exchange of New York. They were trying to bring order and standardization to the chaotic conditions that existed in their industry. Soon, egg trade became part of the business conducted on the exchange and the name was modified to the Butter, Cheese, and Egg Exchange. In 1882, the name finally changed to the New York Mercantile Exchange when opening trade to dried fruits, canned goods, and poultry.

As centralized warehouses were built into principal market centers such as New York and Chicago in the early 20th century, exchanges in smaller cities began to disappear giving more business to the exchanges such as the NYMEX in bigger cities. In 1933, the COMEX was established through the merger of four smaller exchanges; the National Metal Exchange, the Rubber Exchange of New York, the National Raw Silk Exchange, and the New York Hide Exchange. Through the 1970s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s COMEX, NYMEX, and other exchanges shared a single trading floor in 4 World Trade Center.

===Goods===
For years, the NYMEX traders had done a large business trading futures of Maine&#x27;s potato crop. According to Leah McGrath Goodman&#x27;s 2011 book &quot;The Asylum&quot;, manipulation in this market was commonplace, performed by various parties including potato inspectors and NYMEX traders. The worst incident was the 1970s potato bust, when Idaho potato magnate J. R. Simplot allegedly went short in huge numbers, leaving a large amount of contracts unsettled at the expiration date, resulting in a large number of defaulted delivery contracts. A public outcry followed, and the newly created Commodity Futures Trading Commission held hearings. NYMEX was barred not only from continuing to trade in potato futures, but from entering any new area in which it hadn&#x27;t traded before. NYMEX&#x27;s reputation was severely damaged, because, as future chairman Michel Marks told Goodman in his book, &quot;The essence of an exchange is the sanctity of its contract.&quot;

When the potato ban came into effect, NYMEX&#x27;s platinum, palladium and heating oil markets were not significantly affected. However, NYMEX&#x27;s reputation suffered in Washington, D.C., especially with the regulations in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the president of the exchange, Richard Leone brought in John Elting Treat, White House energy adviser to Presidents Carter and Reagan to help restore the credibility of NYMEX and to help the exchange explore the possibility of entering the petroleum market recognizing the great potential for moving well beyond the limited size of the New York Heating Oil market. When Leone left NYMEX in 1981 as a result of a strong disagreement with the NYMEX board, John Elting Treat was asked to replace him as president. The launching of the WTI crude oil contract was championed by Treat, who, with difficulty, convinced the board and the two Marks family members, veteran and highly respected floor trader Francis Marks and his son, Michael, who had just become chairman of the board, to take a chance on trading crude oil. Arnold Safir was one of the members of an advisory committee formed by Treat to help design the new contract. Treat, with Board Chairman Marks and the support of the rest of the NYMEX board, eventually chose West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as the traded product and Cushing, Oklahoma, as the delivery point. Robin Woodhead, who later became the first chairman of the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) in London started an active dialogue with Treat about whether they could start a Brent Crude oil contracts. Treat was very supportive and gave Woodhead strong support and a lot of advice. Shortly thereafter, after substantial conversations, The IPE was formally launched and started trading Brent.

Treat and his research staff then began looking for other oil products to trade. Gasoline was clearly next on the product list but there was a lot of debate about where the delivery point should be. The Gulf Coast was the easiest, but the exchange also looked at California markets, but decided they wouldn&#x27;t work. Treat then started looking simultaneously at launching crude and later products options contracts. He found that the existing NYMEX floor traders didn&#x27;t have the mathematical skills necessary to trade options, so the exchange offered financial inducements to get members of the American Stock Exchange&#x27;s options traders to come over and trade options on petroleum futures. Under Treat&#x27;s leadership, NYMEX also began to research the potential for trading natural gas and electricity, but focused first on natural gas. Product quality of natural gas was not an issue in that market, but the delivery point was a more difficult choice.

After launching the original crude oil futures contract, Treat began an aggressive marketing campaign to first bring in the large US and British oil companies and then moved on to pull in the large Middle East producers. It took almost a year to get the first US &quot;majors&quot; 
to start trading, but several &quot;majors&quot; did not start for almost 5 years. The initial resistance from the OPEC producers was almost impossible to break through, although some finally gave in, among the first being Venezuela. The rumors on the floor at that time were the Arab producers would trade gold futures as a proxy for oil prices (since the Arabs were major purchasers of gold and would buy more when their pockets were filled by rising oil prices, and conversely sell when oil revenues fell and reduced their ability to buy gold).

After the potato ban, NYMEX&#x27;s existence was in doubt. Most of the trading volume had been in potatoes. Without a good commodity, the traders had trouble making money. Eventually, the new chairman, Michel Marks – the son of commodities icon Francis Q. Marks – along with economist Arnold Safer, figured out that NYMEX could revamp an old heating oil futures contract. When the government deregulated heating oil, the contract had a chance of becoming a good object of trade on the floor. A new futures contract was carefully drawn up and trading began on a tiny scale in 1978. Some of the first users of NYMEX heating oil deliveries were small scale suppliers of people in the Northern United States.

NYMEX&#x27;s business threatened some entrenched interests like big oil and government groups like OPEC that had traditionally controlled oil prices. NYMEX provided an &quot;open market&quot; and thus transparent pricing for heating oil, and, eventually, crude oil, gasoline, and natural gas. NYMEX&#x27;s oil futures contracts were standardized for the delivery of West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude oil to Cushing.

===Growth===

The energy trading business took off, and NYMEX boomed. The open outcry floor became a cacophony of shouting traders and pit cards. The pits became a place where many people without much education or ability to fit into Wall Street could have a chance at being rich. Goodman&#x27;s book tells the stories of many of the personalities that built the exchange in this era.

COMEX (Commodity Exchange, Inc), one of the exchanges that shared 4 World Trade Center with NYMEX, had traditionally looked down on NYMEX for being smaller and for having the toxic reputation from the potato bust. With NYMEX&#x27;s energy trading boom, it became much larger and wealtheir than COMEX. On August 3, 1994, the NYMEX and COMEX finally merged under the NYMEX name. By the late 1990s, there were more people working on the NYMEX floor than there was space for them. In 1997, the NYMEX moved to a new building on the Southwestern portion of Manhattan, part of a complex called the World Financial Center. In 2014 the buildings were renamed to Brookfield Place.

==Later history==

===September 11, 2001, attacks===

The NYBOT&#x27;s original headquarters and trading floor were destroyed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Several NYMEX people were lost in the tragedy, even though the new NYMEX building itself was mostly undamaged. Despite the area&#x27;s devastation, the exchange&#x27;s management and staff quickly had the exchange working.

The WTC/WFC art gallery, long located in the Nymex building, continued showing world and community art until 2012. The last-ever exhibit there was a solo show by actualist painter Terry Ward.

On February 26, 2003, the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) signed a lease agreement with the NYMEX to move into its World Financial Center headquarters and trading facility. NYMEX maintained a close relationship with many organizations and people at World Trade Center, and After the attacks, the NYMEX built a $12 million trading floor backup facility outside of New York City with 700 traders&#x27; booths, 2,000 telephones, and a backup computer system. This backup was in case of another terrorist attack or natural disaster in Lower Manhattan.

===Electronic trading===
NYMEX held a virtual monopoly on &quot;open market&quot; oil futures trading (as opposed to the &quot;dark market&quot; or over-the-counter market. However, in the early 2000s the electronically based exchanges started taking away the business of the open outcry markets like NYMEX. Enron&#x27;s online energy trading system was part of this trend. Jeff Sprecher&#x27;s Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, was another example. ICE eventually began trading oil contracts that were extremely similar to NYMEX&#x27;s, taking away market share almost immediately.

The open outcry NYMEX pit traders had always been against electronic trading because it threatened their income and their lifestyle. The executives at NYMEX felt that electronic trading was the only way to keep the exchange competitive. NYMEX teamed up with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to use Globex in 2006. The trading pits emptied out as many traders quit. Banks, hedge funds, and huge oil companies stopped making telephone calls to the pits and started trading directly for themselves over screens.

In this period the NYMEX also worked on founding the Dubai Mercantile Exchange in the United Arab Emirates. This was chronicled by Ben Mezrich in his New York Times Best Selling book &quot;Rigged&quot; which has been optioned for film adaptation by Summit Entertainment.

=== Sell-off ===

The final executive management of NYMEX decided to sell it off in pieces, take golden parachute buyouts, and leave. In 2006 NYMEX underwent an initial public offering (IPO) and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The executives and exchange members owning seats on the exchange saw their net worth increase by millions of dollars in a few hours - many of the pit traders, who leased their seats instead of owning, did not. Other parts of NYMEX were sold to private equity investors and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CME got ownership of the physical facilities and began scrubbing the NYMEX logo and name off of various artifacts and closed the NYMEX museum. NYMEX eventually became little more than a brand name used by CME. By 2011, NYMEX open outcry trading was relegated for the most part to a small number of people trading options.

In 2009 it was reported that holders of COMEX gold futures contracts experienced problems taking delivery of their metal. Along with chronic delivery delays, some investors received delivery of bars not matching their contract in serial number and weight. The delays could not be easily explained by slow warehouse movements, as the daily reports of these movements showed little activity. Because of these problems, there were concerns that COMEX did not have the gold inventory to back its existing warehouse receipts.

<doc id="469730" wikidata="Q372251" url="?curid=469730" title="Substitution effect">
<text>In economics and particularly in consumer choice theory, the substitution effect is one component of the effect of a change in the price of a good upon the amount of that good demanded by a consumer, the other being the income effect.

When a good&#x27;s price decreases, if hypothetically the same consumption bundle were to be retained, income would be freed up which could be spent on a combination of more of each of the goods. Thus the new total consumption bundle chosen, compared to the old one, reflects both the effect of the changed relative prices of the two goods (one unit of one good can now be traded for a different quantity of the other good than before as the ratio of their prices has changed) &quot;and&quot; the effect of the freed-up income. The effect of the relative price change is called the &quot;substitution effect&quot;, while the effect due to income having been freed up is called the &quot;income effect&quot;.

If income is altered in response to the price change such that a new budget line is drawn passing through the old consumption bundle but with the slope determined by the new prices and the consumer&#x27;s optimal choice is on this budget line, the resulting change in consumption is called the Slutsky substitution effect. The idea is that the consumer is given enough money to purchase his old bundle at the new prices, and his choice changes are seen.

If instead, a new budget line is found with the slope determined by the new prices but tangent to the indifference curve going through the old bundle, the difference between the new point of tangency and the old bundle is the Hicks substitution effect. The idea now is that the consumer is given just enough income to achieve his old utility at the new prices, and how his choice changes is seen. The Hicks substitution effect is illustrated in the next section.

Some authors refer to one of these two concepts as simply the substitution effect. The popular textbook by Varian describes the Slutsky variant as the primary one, but also gives a good explanation of the distinction.

The same concepts also apply if the price of one good goes up instead of down, with the substitution effect reflecting the change in relative prices and the income effect reflecting the fact the income has been soaked up into additional spending on the retained units of the now-pricier good.

For example, consider coffee and tea. If the price of coffee increased, consumers of hot drinks may decide to start drinking tea instead. This will cause the demand for tea to increase. Likewise, if the price of coffee was to decrease, tea-drinkers may decide to shift their drinking habits and substitute coffee for their daily drinking habits, causing the demand for tea to decrease.

Economists had long understood that changes in price could lead to two main responses by consumers, initial work on this subject had been done by Vilfredo Pareto in the 1890s, but it wasn&#x27;t until Eugen Slutsky’s 1915 article that rigor was brought to the subject. Because Slutsky’s original paper was published during World War I in Italian, economists in the Anglo-American world did not become aware of Slutsky’s contributions until the 1930s. The English world was fully introduced to Slutsky&#x27;s ideas in 1934 when &quot;A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value&quot; was published by John Hicks and RGD Allen, this paper built upon work by Pareto and came to conclusions Slutsky had realized two decades prior.

==Graphical analysis==
Suppose the initial situation is given by the graph (with good Y plotted horizontally) with the indicated (and never-changing) indifference curves shown and with budget constraint BC1 and with the consumer choosing point A because it puts him on the highest possible indifference curve consistent with BC1. The position and slope of the budget constraint are based on the consumer&#x27;s income and on the prices of the two goods X and Y. If the price of Y falls, the budget constraint pivots to BC2, with a greater intercept of good Y because if all income were spent on Y more of it could be purchased at the now-lower price. The overall effect of the price change is that the consumer now chooses the consumption bundle at point C.

But the move from A to C can be decomposed into two parts. The substitution effect is the change that would occur if the consumer were required to remain on the original indifference curve; this is the move from A to B. The income effect is the simultaneous move from B to C that occurs because the lower price of one good in fact allows movement to a higher indifference curve. (In this graph Y is an inferior good since C is to the left of B so Y2 &lt; Ys.)

== Elasticity of substitution ==
The concept of the elasticity of substitution was developed by two different economists, each with their own focus. One of these economists was John Hicks, who defined elasticity of substitution as the change in percentage in the relative number of factors of production used, given a particular change in percentage in relative prices or marginal products. This definition is also known as the direct elasticity of substitution. The other economist was Joan Robinson, who defined elasticity of substitution as the change in proportion of the ratio of the number of factors used divided by the change in proportion of the ratio of each factor&#x27;s prices. These two definitions function in the same way when limited to two factors of production.

<doc id="469734" wikidata="Q934262" url="?curid=469734" title="House of Aisin-Gioro">
<text>The House of Aisin-Gioro is a Manchu clan that ruled the Later Jin dynasty (1616–1636), the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), and Manchukuo (1932–1945) in the history of China. Under the Ming dynasty, members of the Aisin Gioro clan served as chiefs of the Jianzhou Jurchens, one of the three major Jurchen tribes at this time. Qing bannermen passed through the gates of the Great Wall in 1644, and eventually conquered the short-lived Shun dynasty, Xi dynasty and Southern Ming dynasty. After gaining total control of China proper, the Qing dynasty later expanded into other adjacent regions, including Xinjiang, Tibet, Outer Mongolia, and Taiwan. The dynasty reached its zenith during the High Qing era and under the Qianlong Emperor, who reigned from 1735 to 1796. This reign was followed by a century of gradual decline.

The house lost power in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution. Puyi, the last Aisin-Gioro emperor, nominally maintained his imperial title in the Forbidden City until the Articles of Favourable Treatment were revoked by Feng Yuxiang in 1924. The Qing was China&#x27;s last orthodox imperial dynasty.

==Etymology==

&quot;Aisin&quot; means &#x27;gold&#x27;, corresponding to Chinese . &quot;Gioro&quot; refers to the clan&#x27;s ancestral home in today Yilan County, Heilongjiang. Following the fall of the Qing empire, most members of the clan have changed their surnames to Han Chinese surnames such as &quot;Jin&quot;, Zhao, Ai, Luo, Bai, Hai or Slavicized in Russia like &quot;Aysinev&quot;, Zolotov or Zolotaryov.

For example, one of the heads of the Aisin-Gioro clan adopted the Chinese name Jin Youzhi.

== Heads of the House ==
The Aisin-Gioro House had no system of automatic succession such as primogeniture or a law of succession. Instead, an emperor would name an heir in a secret edict. The edict would be read before senior members of the clan following the emperor&#x27;s death. An emperor could have numerous sons by women of various ranks. In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown and China was declared a republic. Puyi, the last emperor, was granted the right to maintain his imperial title in the Forbidden City until 1924, when the Articles of Favorable Treatment were revoked. He went to Changchun in northeastern China to serve as chief executive (1932–1934) and later emperor (1934–1945) of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan.

The more recent heads of the house are given according to a succession law approved by Puyi in 1937. This follows the practice of relevant news reports and reference works. The law provided for father-to-son succession. Brothers may succeed in the absence of male issue. As a full brother, Pujie had precedence over half brother Jin Youzhi.

== Origins ==
The Aisin-Gioro traced its ancestry to Bukūri Yongšon, a legendary warrior of the thirteenth century. Emperor Hongtaiji claimed that Bukūri Yongšon was conceived from a virgin birth. According to the legend, three heavenly maidens, Enggulen, Jenggulen, and Fekulen, were bathing at a lake called Bulhūri Omo near the Changbai Mountains. A magpie dropped a piece of red fruit near Fekulen, who ate it. She then became pregnant with Bukūri Yongšon. However, this legend belongs to another Manchu clan, the Hurha (Hurka). The real ancestor of the Aisin-Gioro clan was Mengtemu (Möngke Temür), a chieftain of the Odoli tribe in the Mongolian Yuan Empire.

Nurgaci created the Aisin-Gioro clan as part of a reorganization of Jurchen society he initiated in 1601. His supporters were enrolled into the banner system and the population militarized. The Gioro clan was partitioned. Those descended from Taksi, Nurgaci&#x27;s father, were designated &quot;Aisin&quot; (gold). Nurgaci assigned other Gioros to other clans, including Silin Gioro (Superior Gioro), Irgen Gioro (Inferior Gioro), and Tongyan Gioro (miscellaneous Gioro).

When the Jurchens were reorganized by Nurhaci into the Eight Banners, many clans were created as a group of unrelated people (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

The Manchu have an equally artificial origin. Although the people ruled by Aisin-Gioro were ethnically mixed, the entire population was designated as &quot;Manchu&quot; in 1635.

===Expansion under Nurhaci and Hong Taiji===

Under Nurhaci and his son Hong Taiji, the Aisin Gioro clan of the Jianzhou tribe won hegemony among the rival Jurchen tribes of the northeast, then through warfare and alliances extended its control into Inner Mongolia. Nurhachi created large, permanent civil-military units called &quot;banners&quot; to replace the small hunting groups used in his early campaigns. A banner was composed of smaller companies; it included some 7,500 warriors and their households, including slaves, under the command of a chieftain. Each banner was identified by a coloured flag that was yellow, white, blue, or red, either plain or with a border design. Originally there were four, then eight, Manchu banners; new banners were created as the Manchu conquered new regions, and eventually there were Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese banners, eight for each ethnic group. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were actually of Manchu ancestry. The Qing conquest of the Ming dynasty was thus achieved with a multiethnic army led by Manchu nobles and Han Chinese generals. Han Chinese soldiers were organised into the Army of the Green Standard, which became a sort of imperial constabulary force posted throughout China and on the frontiers.

The change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese. The Qing dynasty carefully hid the 2 original editions of the books of &quot;&quot;Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu&quot; and the &quot;Manzhou Shilu Tu&quot;&quot; (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the &quot;superior country&quot; which they called Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The &quot;Veritable Records of the Ming&quot; were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this. This historical revisionism helped remove the accusation of rebellion from the Qing ruling family refusing to mention in the Mingshi the fact that the Qing founders were Ming China&#x27;s subjects. The Qing Yongzheng Emperor attempted to rewrite the historical record and claim that the Aisin Gioro were never subjects of past dynasties and empires trying to cast Nurhaci&#x27;s acceptance of Ming titles like Dragon Tiger General (longhu jiangjun 龍虎將軍) by claiming he accepted to &quot;please Heaven&quot;.

==Intermarriage and political alliances==
The Qing emperors arranged marriages between Aisin Gioro noblewomen and outsiders to create political marriage alliances. During the Manchu conquest of the Ming Empire, the Manchu rulers offered to marry their princesses to Han Chinese military officers who served the Ming Empire as a means of inducing these officers into surrendering or defecting to their side. Aisin Gioro princesses were also married to Mongol princes, for the purpose of forming alliances between the Manchus and Mongol tribes.

The Manchus successfully induced one Han Chinese general, Li Yongfang (李永芳), into defecting to their side by offering him a position in the Manchu banners. Li Yongfang also married the daughter of Abatai, a son of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s founder Nurhaci. Many more Han Chinese abandoned their posts in the Ming Empire and defected to the Manchu side. There were over 1,000 marriages between Han Chinese men and Manchu women in 1632 – due to a proposal by Yoto (岳托), a nephew of the Manchu emperor Hong Taiji. Hong Taiji believed that intermarriage between Han Chinese and Manchus could help to eliminate ethnic conflicts in areas already occupied by the Manchus, as well as help the Han Chinese forget their ancestral roots more easily.

Manchu noblewomen were also married to Han Chinese men who surrendered or defected to the Manchu side. Aisin Gioro women were married to the sons of the Han Chinese generals Sun Sike (孫思克), Geng Jimao, Shang Kexi and Wu Sangui. The &quot;e&#x27;fu&quot; (額駙) rank was given to husbands of Manchu princesses. Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title &quot;Prince Jingnan&quot;, while his grandsons Geng Jingzhong, Geng Zhaozhong (耿昭忠) and Geng Juzhong (耿聚忠) married Hooge&#x27;s daughter, Abatai&#x27;s granddaughter, and Yolo&#x27;s daughter respectively. Sun Sike&#x27;s son, Sun Cheng&#x27;en (孫承恩), married the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s fourth daughter, Heshuo Princess Quejing (和硕悫靖公主).

Imperial Duke Who Assists the State (宗室輔國公) Aisin Gioro Suyan&#x27;s (蘇燕) daughter was married to Han Chinese Banner General Nian Gengyao.

==Genetics==
Haplogroup C3b2b1*-M401(xF5483) has been identified as a possible marker of the Aisin Gioro and is found in ten different ethnic minorities in northern China, but largely absent from Han Chinese.

Genetic testing also showed that the haplogroup C3b1a3a2-F8951 of the Aisin Gioro family came to southeastern Manchuria after migrating from their place of origin in the Amur river&#x27;s middle reaches, originating from ancestors related to Daurs in the Transbaikal area. The Tungusic speaking peoples mostly have C3c-M48 as their subclade of C3 which drastically differs from the C3b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup of the Aisin Gioro which originates from Mongolic speaking populations like the Daur. Jurchen (Manchus) are a Tungusic people. The Mongol Genghis Khan&#x27;s haplogroup C3b1a3a1-F3796 (C3*-Star Cluster) is a fraternal &quot;brother&quot; branch of C3b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup of the Aisin Gioro.

A genetic test was conducted on seven men who claimed Aisin Gioro descent with three of them showing documented genealogical information of all their ancestors up to Nurhaci. Three of them turned out to share the C3b2b1*-M401(xF5483) haplogroup, out of them, two of them were the ones who provided their documented family trees. The other four tested were unrelated. The Daur Ao clan carries the unique haplogroup subclade C2b1a3a2-F8951, the same haplogroup as Aisin Gioro and both Ao and Aisin Gioro only diverged merely a couple of centuries ago from a shared common ancestor. Other members of the Ao clan carry haplogroups like N1c-M178, C2a1b-F845, C2b1a3a1-F3796 and C2b1a2-M48. People from northeast China, the Daur Ao clan and Aisin Gioro clan are the main carriers of haplogroup C2b1a3a2-F8951. The Mongolic C2*-Star Cluster (C2b1a3a1-F3796) haplogroup is a fraternal branch to Aisin Gioro&#x27;s C2b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup.

==Current population==

There were merely 29,000 members of Aisin Gioro in 1912 when the Qing dynasty fell, in sharp contrast to the more fecund and fertile Ming dynasty before it, whose ruling House of Zhu had 200,000 (0.2 million) members by the fall of the Ming dynasty. The Manchu emperors had smaller reproduction and harems than the Ming on average and taxed Chinese peasant less than the Ming did to maintain the harem. The Ming Wanli emperor&#x27;s harem&#x27;s daily expenditure was more than the Qing Yongzheng emperor&#x27;s harem annual expenditure. There were 6 generations of Aisin Gioro before Emperor Shunzhi&#x27;s reign since Nurhaci&#x27;s grandfather founded the Aisin Gioro clan. Going by the lowest estimate of tribal chief&#x27;s fertility, five sons per man, Aisin Gioro&#x27;s number ought to have been 3,000 or 3,125 at the start of the Qing. This meant during that China&#x27;s population growth in general exactly matched the entire Qing dynasty the Aisin Gioro clan&#x27;s rate of growth for male members carrying the same surname from the start of the Qing to the end of the Qing, which was growth by a factor of 10 from the initial number at the beginning of the Qing dynasty. And it was only two time&#x27;s China&#x27;s general population&#x27;s growth rate when it included non-male line descendants of the Qing imperial family via Aisin Gioro females who did not pass the family name to their descendants. The Ming imperial Zhu family had more than 80,000 people by 1604, 62,000 in 1594, 28,492 in 1569, 28,840 in 1562, 19,611 in 1553, 2,495 in 1506–1521, 127 in 1403–1424 and 58 in 1368–1398. The Empresses of the Qing were very infertile and most often when an emperor died, there was no son of the empress alive. The Xianfeng Emperor had only one son surviving, the Tongzhi emperor. The Guangxu emperor and Tongzhi emperor both had no children. In 1660 the core branch of Aisin Gioro had 378 people while in 1915 it had 29,292 people.

Approximately 300,000 to 400,000 ethnic Manchus in China are surnamed Aisin-Gioro (愛新覺羅), while an additional 3.8 million people are surnamed Jin (金), the most common Sinicized form, which has been embraced by core imperial family members like Jin Yuzhang. This gives an upper limit of 4.2 million people who could &quot;potentially&quot; be patrilineal descendants of Nurhaci, but this figure must be used with caution as there are non-Manchu ethnic groups (notably Koreans) who also use the surname Jin (&quot;Kim&quot;) for unrelated reasons.

==Notable members ==
===Iron-cap princes and their descendants===
According to Qing dynasty imperial tradition, the sons of princes do not automatically inherit their fathers&#x27; titles in the same rank as their fathers. For example, Yongqi held the title &quot;Prince Rong of the First Rank&quot;, but when his title was passed on to his son, Mianyi, it became &quot;Prince Rong of the Second Rank&quot;. In other words, the title gets diminished by one rank as it is passed down to each subsequent generation, but generally to no lower than the rank of &quot;kesi-be tuwakiyara gurun-de aisilara gung&quot; (second class imperial duke). However, there were 12 princes who were awarded the &quot;shi xi wang ti&quot; (perpetual heritability, a.k.a. &quot;iron-cap&quot;) privilege, which meant that their titles can be passed on to subsequent generations without the downgrading effect.

The 12 &quot;iron-cap&quot; princely peerages are listed as follows. Some of them were renamed at different points in time, hence they had multiple names.

* Prince Zheng / Prince Jian, the line of Jirgalang (1599–1655), descendant of Taksi
* Prince Li / Prince Xun / Prince Kang, the line of Daišan (1583–1648), descendant of Nurhaci
** Prince Keqin / Prince Cheng / Prince Ping / Prince Yanxi, the line of Yoto (1599–1639), descendant of Nurhaci
*** Prince Shuncheng, the line of Lekdehun (1619–1652), descendant of Nurhaci
* Prince Rui, the line of Dorgon (1612–1650), descendant of Nurhaci
* Prince Yu, the line of Dodo (1614–1649), descendant of Nurhaci
* Prince Su / Prince Xian, the line of Hooge (1609–1648), descendant of Hong Taiji
* Prince Chengze / Prince Zhuang, the line of Šose (1629–1655), descendant of Hong Taiji
* Prince Yi, the line of Yinxiang (1686–1730), descendant of Kangxi Emperor
* Prince Qing, the line of Yikuang (1838–1917), descendant of Qianlong Emperor
* Prince Gong, the line of Yixin (1833–1898), descendant of Daoguang Emperor
* Prince Chun, the line of Yixuan (1840–1891), descendant of Daoguang Emperor

<doc id="469742" wikidata="Q2486753" url="?curid=469742" title="List of tunnels in Iceland">
<text>There are 14 open road tunnels in Iceland in the Icelandic road system. Additionally, there is one road tunnel only for use by a silicon plant in Húsavík. Tunnels in Iceland are usually built under mountains to prevent winter isolation of remote communities which would otherwise have to depend on high roads that are often closed due to snow, to shorten distance between communities, and to increase road safety by bypassing dangerous stretches of road. A tunnel under a fjord, the Hvalfjörður Tunnel, is among the longest underwater road tunnels in the world, and goes as deep as below sea level.

Tunneling is a relatively recent trend in Icelandic road infrastructure. It started off slowly and was at first only used in extreme circumstances, such as under Arnardalshamar in 1948. The first tunnel of significant length was opened in 1967 and provided the northern town of Siglufjörður with its first year-round road link to the rest of the country. The second tunnel, opened in 1977, replaced a difficult road over the mountain pass Oddsskarð in eastern Iceland, which could only be used during the short summer and was the only road link to the town of Neskaupstaður. The third tunnel was opened in 1992 and replaced a very hazardous mountainside road to the northern town of Ólafsfjörður. All three of these tunnels were built as a single lane with widenings at regular intervals, where vehicles coming from opposite directions can pass. As improved engineering methods made tunneling cheaper and Iceland became more prosperous in the 1990s, tunnels became viable options for places where they had not been considered before. In 1996 the Vestfjarðagöng tunnel opened in the Westfjords region; it ended the winter isolation of three villages by linking them to the town of Ísafjörður. This tunnel was the last one built with single-lane segments.

In 1998 the sub-sea Hvalfjörður Tunnel opened, reducing the distance from Reykjavík to the town of Akranes by 60 kilometers and consequently abolishing the ferry service between the two. The distance between Reykjavík and other destinations on the north side of the fjord Hvalfjörður was reduced by 45 kilometers. It was the first tunnel in Iceland to have been financed, built and operated by a private entity and, as such, it was also the first tunnel where tolls were charged. The original plan assumed it would take 20 years (until 2018) to pay back the cost of building the tunnel and that the tunnel. As per the original plan, the tunnel was turned over to the state on the 30th of September 2018 when the Icelandic Road Administration took over its operation. Traffic has proved to be significantly higher than originally projected. So high in fact, that the operator of the tunnel has suggested building a new tunnel alongside the current one, since traffic is reaching the threshold mandated by European regulation (10,000 vehicles daily) where traffic in opposing directions is meant to be separated.

Nine tunnels have opened since the beginning of the 21st century. In the 2010s, Bolungarvíkurgöng on route 61 in Westfjords between Hnifsdalur and Bolungarvik, replacing the road which was often affected by rockfalls and avalanches, and Héðinsfjarðargöng I and II on route 76 in Northeastern Region between the towns Ólafsfjörður and Siglufjörður, reducing the distance between the towns to 15 km.

<text>Aphrodite Pandemos (; &quot;common to all the people&quot;) occurs as an epithet of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. This epithet can be interpreted in different ways. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Pausanias of Athens describes Aphrodite Pandemos as the goddess of sensual pleasures, in opposition to Aphrodite Urania, or &quot;the heavenly Aphrodite&quot;. At Elis, she was represented as riding on a ram by Scopas. Another interpretation is that of Aphrodite uniting all the inhabitants of a country into one social or political body. In this respect she was worshipped at Athens along with Peitho (persuasion), and her worship was said to have been instituted by Theseus at the time when he united the scattered townships into one great body of citizens. According to some authorities, it was Solon who erected the sanctuary of Aphrodite Pandemos, either because her image stood in the agora, or because the hetairai had to pay the costs of its erection. The worship of Aphrodite Pandemos also occurs at Megalopolis in Arcadia, and at Thebes. A festival in honour of her is mentioned by Athenaeus. The sacrifices offered to her consisted of white goats. Pandemos occurs also as a surname of Eros. According to Harpocration, who quotes Apollodorus, Aphrodite Pandemos has very old origins, &quot;the title Pandemos was given to the goddess established in the neighborhood of the Old Agora because all the Demos (people) gathered there of old in their assemblies which they called agorai.&quot; To honour Aphrodite&#x27;s and Peitho&#x27;s role in the unification of Attica, the Aphrodisia festival was organized annually on the fourth of the month of Hekatombaion (the fourth day of each month was the sacred day of Aphrodite). The Synoikia that honoured Athena, the protectress of Theseus and main patron of Athens, also took place in the month of Hekatombaion.

Christine Downing comments that, &quot;Pausanias&#x27;s description of the love associated with Aphrodite Pandemos as dedicated only to sensual pleasure and therefore directed indifferently to women and men, and that associated with the Ouranian Aphrodite as &quot;altogether male&quot; and dedicated to the education of the soul of the beloved is actually an innovation—for Aphrodite Ourania was served in Corinth by prostitutes and Aphrodite Pandemos was the goddess as worshipped by the whole community.&quot;

The goddess riding on a goat was also known as Aphrodite Epitragia, &quot;from a she-goat&quot;. According to Plutarch, she acquired this epithet from an episode in the life of Theseus when the hero sacrificed a goat to Aphrodite before departing for Crete in hopes that she would guide him on his voyage. As Theseus sacrificed the customary she-goat, the animal was suddenly transformed into a male goat.

<doc id="469760" wikidata="Q2713824" url="?curid=469760" title="Metric map">
<text>In the mathematical theory of metric spaces, a metric map is a function between metric spaces that does not increase any distance. These maps are the morphisms in the category of metric spaces, Met. Such functions are always continuous functions.
They are also called Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant 1, nonexpansive maps, nonexpanding maps, weak contractions, or short maps.

Specifically, suppose that formula_1 and formula_2 are metric spaces and formula_3 is a function from formula_1 to formula_2. Thus we have a metric map when, for any points formula_6 and formula_7 in formula_1,
formula_9
Here formula_10 and formula_11 denote the metrics on formula_1 and formula_2 respectively.

== Examples ==

Consider the metric space formula_14 with the Euclidean metric. Then the function formula_15 is a metric map, since for formula_16, formula_17.

==Category of metric maps==
The function composition of two metric maps is another metric map, and the identity map formula_18 on a metric space formula_19 is a metric map, which is also the identity element for function composition. Thus metric spaces together with metric maps form a category Met. Met is a subcategory of the category of metric spaces and Lipschitz functions. A map between metric spaces is an isometry if and only if it is a bijective metric map whose inverse is also a metric map. Thus the isomorphisms in Met are precisely the isometries.

==Strictly metric maps==
One can say that formula_3 is strictly metric if the inequality is strict for every two different points. Thus a contraction mapping is strictly metric, but not necessarily the other way around. Note that an isometry is &quot;never&quot; strictly metric, except in the degenerate case of the empty space or a single-point space.

== Multivalued version ==
A mapping formula_21 from a metric space formula_1 to the family of nonempty subsets of formula_1 is said to be Lipschitz if there exists formula_24 such that
formula_25
for all formula_26, where formula_27 is the Hausdorff distance. When formula_28, formula_29 is called &quot;nonexpansive&quot;, and when formula_30, formula_29 is called a contraction.

<doc id="469762" wikidata="Q1784525" url="?curid=469762" title="Tailings">
<text>In mining, tailings or tails are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction (gangue) of an ore. Tailings are different from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.

The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which uses water and gravity to concentrate the valuable minerals, or hard rock mining, which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material. In the latter, the extraction of minerals from ore requires comminution, i.e., grinding the ore into fine particles to facilitate extraction of the target element(s). Because of this comminution, tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles, ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a few micrometres. Mine tailings are usually produced from the mill in slurry form, which is a mixture of fine mineral particles and water.

Tailings are likely to be dangerous sources of toxic chemicals such as heavy metals, sulfides, and radioactive content. These chemicals are especially dangerous when stored in water in ponds behind tailings dams. These ponds are also vulnerable to major breaches or leaks from the dams, causing environmental disasters, such as the Mount Polley disaster in British Columbia. Because of these and other environmental concerns such as groundwater leakage, toxic emissions and bird death, tailing piles and ponds have received more scrutiny, especially in developed countries, but the first UN-level standard for tailing management was only established 2020.

There are a wide range of methods for recovering economic value, containing, or otherwise mitigating the impacts of tailings. However, internationally, these practices are poor, sometimes violating human rights.

==Terminology==
Tailings are also called mine dumps, culm dumps, slimes, refuse, leach residue, slickens, or terra-cone (terrikon).

==Examples==

===Sulfide minerals===
The effluent from the tailings from the mining of sulfidic minerals has been described as &quot;the largest environmental liability of the mining industry&quot;. These tailings contain large amounts of pyrite (FeS2) and Iron(II) sulfide (FeS), which are rejected from the sought-after ores of copper and nickel, as well as coal. Although harmless underground, these minerals are reactive toward air in the presence of microorganisms, which if not properly managed lead to acid mine drainage.
===Phosphate rock mining===

Between 100 million and 280 million tons of phosphogypsum waste are estimated to be produced annually as a consequence of the processing of phosphate rock for the production of phosphate fertilizers. In addition to being useless and abundant, phosphogypsum is radioactive due to the presence of naturally occurring uranium, thorium, and their daughter isotopes. Depending on the price achievable on the uranium market, extraction of the uranium content may be economically lucrative even absent other incentives, such as reducing the harm the radioactive heavy metals do to the environment.

===Aluminium===
Bauxite tailings is a waste product generated in the industrial production of aluminium. Making provision for the approximately that is produced annually is one of the most significant problems for the aluminium mining industry.

====Red mud====
===Coal===
==Economics==
Early mining operations often did not take adequate steps to make tailings areas environmentally safe after closure. Modern mines, particularly those in jurisdictions with well-developed mining regulations and those operated by responsible mining companies, often include the rehabilitation and proper closure of tailings areas in their costs and activities. For example, the Province of Quebec, Canada, requires not only the submission of a closure plan before the start of mining activity, but also the deposit of a financial guarantee equal to 100% of the estimated rehabilitation costs. Tailings dams are often the most significant environmental liability for a mining project.

Mine tailings may have economic value in carbon sequestration due to the large exposed surface area of the minerals.

==Environmental concerns==
The fraction of tailings to ore can range from 90 to 98% for some copper ores to 20–50% of the other (less valuable) minerals. The rejected minerals and rocks liberated through mining and processing have the potential to damage the environment by releasing toxic metals (arsenic and mercury being two major culprits), by acid drainage (usually by microbial action on sulfide ores), or by damaging aquatic wildlife that rely on clear water (vs suspensions).

Tailings ponds can also be a source of acid drainage, leading to the need for permanent monitoring and treatment of water passing through the tailings dam; the cost of mine cleanup has typically been 10 times that of mining industry estimates when acid drainage was involved.

===Disasters===

The greatest danger of tailings ponds is dam failure, with the most publicized failure in the U.S. being the failure of a coal slurry dam in the West Virginia Buffalo Creek Flood of 1972, which killed 125 people; other collapses include the Ok Tedi environmental disaster in New Guinea, which destroyed the fishery of the Ok Tedi River. On average, worldwide, there is one big accident involving a tailings dam each year.

Other disasters caused by tailings dam failures are, the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill and the Ajka alumina plant accident. In 2015, the iron ore tailings dam failure at the Germano mine complex in Minas Gerais, Brazil, was the country&#x27;s biggest environmental disaster. The dam breach caused the death of 19 people due to flooding of tailings slime downstream and affected some 400 km of the Doce river system with toxic effluence and out into the Atlantic Ocean.

==Human rights==
Tailings deposits tend to be located in rural areas or near marginalized communities, such as indigenous communities. The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) recommends that &quot;a human rights due diligence process is required to identify and address those that are most at risk from a tailings facility or its potential failure.&quot;

==Storage methods==
Historically, tailings were disposed of in the most convenient manner, such as in downstream running water or down drains. Because of concerns about these sediments in the water and other issues, tailings ponds came into use. The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses.

===Tailings dams and ponds===

Bounded by impoundments (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use &quot;local materials&quot; including the tailings themselves, and may be considered embankment dams. Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was to contain the tailings slurry with locally available earthen materials. This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge. It is increasingly common for tailings storage facilities to require special barriers like bituminous geomembranes (BGMs) to contain liquid tailings slurries and prevent impact to the surrounding environment. The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances. Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.

Tailing ponds are areas of refused mining tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a pond to allow the sedimentation (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams. It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world. The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as bentonite to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.

There are many different subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits. The most common is the valley pond, which takes advantage of the natural topographical depression in the ground. Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings. Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, among other issues. Dewatering is an important part of pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed – usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the processing cycle. Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced. However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future.

===Paste tailings===
Paste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate. In paste tailings the percent of solids in the tailings slurry is increased through the use of paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage. However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional tailings and the pumping costs for the paste are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.

===Dry stacking===
Tailings do not have to be stored in ponds or sent as slurries into oceans, rivers, or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked. This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.

===Storage in underground workings===

While disposal into exhausted open pits is generally a straightforward operation, disposal into underground voids is more complex. A common modern approach is to mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product that can be used to backfill underground voids and stopes. A common term for this is high-density paste fill (HDPF). HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits as it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids – rather than having to pass around them – which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the Beaconsfield Mine Disaster.

===Riverine tailings===
Usually called riverine tailings disposal (RTD). In most environments, not a particularly environmentally sound practice, it has seen significant utilisation in the past, leading to such spectacular environmental damage as done by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company in Tasmania to the King River, or the poisoning from the Panguna mine on Bougainville Island, which led to large-scale civil unrest on the island, and the eventual permanent closing of the mine.

As of 2005, only three mines operated by international companies continued to use river disposal: The Ok Tedi mine, the Grasberg mine and the Porgera mine, all on New Guinea. This method is used in these cases due to seismic activity and landslide dangers which make other disposal methods impractical and dangerous.

===Submarine tailings===
Commonly referred to as STD (Submarine Tailings Disposal) or DSTD (Deep Sea Tailings Disposal). Tailings can be conveyed using a pipeline then discharged so as to eventually descend into the depths. Practically, it is not an ideal method, as the close proximity to off-shelf depths is rare. When STD is used, the depth of discharge is often comparatively shallow, and extensive damage to the seafloor can result due to covering by the tailings product. If the density and temperature of the tailings product is not controlled, it may travel long distances, or even float to the surface.

This method is used by the gold mine on Lihir Island; its waste disposal has been viewed by environmentalists as highly damaging, while the owners claim that it is not harmful.

===Phytostabilisation===
Phytostabilisation is a form of phytoremediation that uses hyperaccumulator plants for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant&#x27;s presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant&#x27;s roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and water dispersion.

===Different methods===
Considerable effort and research continues to be made into discovering and refining better methods of tailings disposal. Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with coarse waste rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of riverine disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done. However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including AMEC at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia.

===Pond reclamation by microbiology===
During extraction of the oil from oil sand, tailings consisting of water, silt, clays, and other solvents are also created. This solid will become mature fine tailings by gravity. Foght &quot;et al&quot; (1985) estimated that there are 103 anaerobic heterotrophs and 104 sulfate-reducing prokaryotes per milliliter in the tailings pond, based on conventional most probable number methods. Foght set up an experiment with two tailings ponds and an analysis of the archaea, bacteria, and the gas released from tailings ponds showed that those were methanogens. As the depth increased, the moles of CH4 released actually decreased.

Siddique (2006, 2007) states that methanogens in the tailings pond live and reproduce by anaerobic degradation, which will lower the molecular weight from naphtha to aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and methane. Those archaea and bacteria can degrade the naphtha, which was considered as waste during the procedure of refining oil. Both of those degraded products are useful. Aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane can be used as fuel in the humans&#x27; daily lives. In other words, these methanogens improve the coefficient of utilization. Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to be reused for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings ponds are enabled to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can be used in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought.

===Reprocessing===
As mining techniques and the price of minerals improve, it is not unusual for tailings to be reprocessed using new methods, or more thoroughly with old methods, to recover additional minerals. Extensive tailings dumps of Kalgoorlie / Boulder in Western Australia were re-processed profitably in the 1990s by KalTails Mining.

A machine called the PET4K Processing Plant has been used in a variety of countries for the past 20 years to remediate contaminated tailings.

==International policy==
The UN and business communities developed an international standard for tailings management in 2020 after the critical failure of the Brumadinho dam disaster. The program was convened by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the Principles for Responsible Investment.

<text>In government, several constitutional arrangements use reserved political positions, especially when endeavoring to ensure the rights of women, minorities or other segments of society, or preserving a political balance of power.

==Countries with reserved seats ==

=== Europe ===

====Armenia====
Since the 2015 Armenian constitutional referendum, electoral law requires that four seats for ethnic minorities (one Russians, Yezidis, Assyrians and Kurds each) are allocated in the National Assembly.

====Belgium====
The Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region in Belgium includes 17 reserved seats for the Flemish minority, on a total of 89, but there are no separate electorates.

====Croatia====
Croatia reserves eight seats from the minorities and three for citizens living abroad in its parliament. There are three seats for Serbs, one for Italians, and a few more for other ethnic groups, where a single representative represents more than one group (there is only one representative for both Czechs and Slovaks).

====Cyprus====

The Republic of Cyprus is full of reserved political positions. Due to its nature as a bi-communal republic, certain posts are always appropriated among Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. For example, the president is chosen from the Greek Cypriot community by using separate electoral rolls, whereas the vice president is chosen by the Turkish Cypriot community, using their own separate electoral rolls. Similarly 70% of the parliament are chosen from Greek Cypriots whereas 30% are chosen by and from Turkish Cypriots. In the Supreme Court, there should be one Greek, One Turkish and one neutral foreign judge.

Since Turkish invasion of Cyprus, it is not be enforced in reality.

====Denmark====

The Folketing consists of 179 representatives; including two from Greenland and a further two from the Faroe Islands.

==== Finland ====

The Parliament of Finland consists of 200 representatives; including one from Åland who usually caucus with the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland.

==== Kosovo ====

The Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo has 120 directly elected members; 20 are reserved for national minorities as follows:
* 10 seats for the representatives of the Kosovo Serbs.
* 4 seats for the representatives of the Romani, Ashkali and Egyptians.
* 3 seats for the Bosniaks. 
* 2 seats for the Turks.
* 1 seat for the Gorani.

Albanian is the official language of the majority, but all languages of minorities such as Serbian, Turkish and Bosnian are used, with simultaneous interpretation.

==== Romania ====
The Parliament of Romania has 467 members as follows:
* 331 seats in the Chamber of Deputies
** 308 directly elected members
** 19 for each of the ethnic minorities (can vary based on the number of parties running)
** 4 for the Romanian diaspora
* 136 seats in the Senate
** 134 directly elected members
** 2 for the Romanian diaspora

Romanian ethnic minority parties have to nominally pass a lower threshold (5% of the votes needed to win a seat in the lower chamber, calculated by dividing the number of votes of parties, alliances and independent candidates that passed the threshold by the amount of seats that they won). Thus the threshold is below 0.01% and these seats are effectively reserved for the strongest party of each minority. The only cases where a minority have not reached the threshold are the Union of Croats of Romania in 1992 and 1996 (represented since then), the General Union of the Associations of the Hutsul Ethnicity in 1996 and 2000 and the Union of the Czechs of Romania in 2000 (usually represented as part of the Democratic Union of Slovaks and Czechs of Romania and additionally as their own group, Forum of Czechs in Romania, since 2024).

====Slovenia====
The National Assembly of Slovenia has 88 members elected by party-list proportional representation. Another two seats are elected by the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities using the Borda count.

====United Kingdom====
Political parties are permitted to restrict the selection of their candidates in constituencies to a specific gender under the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002; to date, only the Labour Party utilises the law.

The UK also reserves 26 seats in the House of Lords for Church of England bishops, who together are known as the Lords Spiritual.

Additionally, there are five &#x27;protected&#x27; constituencies in the House of Commons: one for the Northern Isles, one for the Outer Hebrides, one for Anglesey and two for the Isle of Wight.

===Asia===
====Bangladesh====
50 seats out of 350 in the Parliament are reserved for women.

====China====
China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) includes special delegations for the military of China (the single largest NPC delegation (≈9%)) and Taiwan (a region it claims but does not control). 55 minority ethnic groups are recognized in China and each has as at least one delegate, though they belong to normal region delegations. Additionally, from 1954 to 1974, the NPC included a special delegation specifically for Overseas Chinese who returned to China.

=====Hong Kong and Macau=====
Hong Kong and Macau provide for constituencies which represent professional or special interest groups rather than geographical locations. Voters for the members representing these constituencies include both natural persons as well as non-human local entities, including organizations and corporations.

====India====

India has seats in the lower house of parliament, state assemblies, local municipal bodies and village-level institutions reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, better-known as Dalits and Adivasis respectively. The election of Dalit and tribal candidates is by the general electorate. Out of 543 constituencies in India&#x27;s parliament, a total of 131 seats (24.13%) are Reserved or blocked for Representatives from Scheduled Castes (84) and Scheduled Tribes (47) only. A new law in 2024, Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam proposes 33% reserved seats for women in the parliament and legislative assemblies of India. This is different from separate electorate practiced in other countries. Many Indian states, like have had parliamentary reserved seats for the Anglo-Indian community, as did the Lok Sabha until 2020.

====Iran====

Iran reserves a fixed number of seats in the Majlis for certain recognized non-Muslim ethnoreligious groups. To wit, two seats are reserved for the Christian Armenian community, and one seat each is reserved for the Assyrians, Jewish, and Zoroastrian communities.

====Jordan====
Jordan has reserved seats for women, Christians, Circassians, Chechens, and Bedouins.

====Lebanon====

Lebanon specifies the religious affiliation of several of its high officers, such as the President (Maronite), the Prime Minister (Sunni Muslim) and the Parliament&#x27;s Speaker (Shia Muslim). Every electoral district for the parliamentary elections includes a fixed number of the various religious communities.

====Pakistan====

In the National Assembly of Pakistan, 60 seats are reserved for women and 10 for Non-Muslims.

==== Philippines ====

Some local legislatures in the Philippines has a reserved seat for indigenous cultural communities called &quot;Indigenous People Mandatory Representation&quot;. These are elected by the indigenous people themselves.

The Local Government Code also calls for reserved seats in local legislatures for women, workers, and one from the urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, disabled people and other sectors, but for these seats, no law, except for the indigenous cultural communities, has passed on how these seats will be filled up.

In Congress, no seats are reserved, although sectoral representatives were appointed by the president to the House of Representatives before the application of the party-list system.

==== Singapore ====

Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was created in 1988. GRC scheme entrenches the presence of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. In a GRC, a number of candidates comes together to stand for elections to Parliament as a group. Each voter of a GRC casts a ballot for a team of candidates, and not for individual candidates. The original stated purpose of GRCs was to guarantee a minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that there would always be a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race.

The office of President will be reserved for a particular racial group (Chinese, Malay and Indian/other minority) — if that community has not been represented for five presidential terms.

====Taiwan====
Since 2008, in the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan, of the total 34 seats of party-list proportional representation, at least half of the party-nominated candidates must be reserved for women. For example, if one party elected 3 candidates of the party-list in the Legislative Yuan, 2 of them must be women. Along with this, since the 1970s six seats are reserved for the indigenous people of Taiwan. There are two constituencies consisting of three seats each reserved for the Highland Aborigine people and the Lowland Aborigine people.

=== Africa ===

====Eritrea====
10 seats out of 105 seats in Parliament are reserved for women.

====Rwanda====
In the Parliament of Rwanda, a minimum of 30% of elected members of the 26-member Senate must be women. In the 80-member Chamber of Deputies, 24 of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another 3 seats are reserved for youth and disabled members.

Partly resulting from this arrangement, 45 female deputies were elected to the Parliament in 2008, making the country the first and only independent country to possess a female majority in its national legislature.

====Tanzania====
At least 20% of seats are required to be set aside for women in accordance with Article 66.1(b) of the Constitution. Currently 113 of 393 (28%) are set aside.

====Uganda====
The Ugandan constitution provides for a reserved woman&#x27;s parliamentary seat from each of the 39 districts.

=== Americas ===

====Argentina====
The Argentine law requires for a 50% quota for female candidates for Congress.

====Canada====
In the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, &quot;exceptional constituencies&quot; exist to ensure representation of Acadians (Argyle, Clare, and Richmond) and Black Nova Scotians (Preston). In 2024, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled that a fourth Acadian riding should be established in northern Cape Breton.

====Colombia====
Under the 2016 peace agreement brokered between the Colombian government and the FARC rebel group, five seats in the Senate and five seats in the House of Representatives are reserved for former FARC combatants.

====United States====
Due to treaties signed by the United States in 1830 and 1835, two Native American tribes (the Cherokee and Choctaw) each hold the right to a non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. As of 2019, only the Cherokee Nation has ever attempted to exercise that right.

The Maine House of Representatives reserves three non-voting positions for the Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Penobscot.

The Reconstructionist 1868 Florida Constitution allocated one seat in the state House of Representatives and one in the Senate for Seminoles. These positions were never filled, however, and the provision was removed following the adoption of the Florida Constitution of 1885.

=== Oceania ===

====Fiji====

Fiji used to provide for the election of specific numbers of Members of Parliament on the basis of three racially defined constituencies: the indigenous Fijians, the Fijian Indians and the &quot;General&quot; electorate.

====New Zealand====

There are currently seven New Zealand Parliament constituencies – known as the Māori electorates – that are reserved for representatives of the Māori people. Māori electorates were introduced in 1867, but have undergone several changes since then. Māori may enrol either in a Māori electorate or on the general roll, but not both. Since 1967 there has not been any specific requirement for candidates in Māori electorates to be Māori themselves, and anyone on either the Māori roll or the General roll can stand as a candidate. Technically, therefore, these seats should not be described as &quot;reserved&quot; as there is no legal or constitutional guarantee that the successful candidate will themselves be of Māori descent. So far, however, every MP from a Māori electorate has been Māori. Also to note, is that under New Zealand&#x27;s mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system, it is the party vote that is most important. All voters, including Māori, are deemed to be on the same master roll in terms of voting for party lists.

==Countries formerly applying reserved political positions==

=== Afghanistan ===
During the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the constitution guaranteed at least 64 delegates to be female in the lower house of the bicameral National Assembly (&quot;The elections law shall adopt measures to attain, through the electorate system, general and fair representation for all the people of the country, and proportionate to the population of very province, on average, at least two females shall be the elected members of the House of People from each province.&quot;), while Kochi nomads elected 10 representatives through a single national constituency. Moreover, &quot;one third of the members (&quot;of the House of Elders&quot;) shall be appointed by the President, for a five-year term, from amongst experts and experienced personalities, including two members from amongst the impaired and handicapped, as well as two from nomads. The President shall appoint fifty percent of these individuals from amongst women.&quot;

===German Democratic Republic===
East Germany reserved seats in the Volkskammer for representatives of women, trade unions and youth organisations.

===Greece===
During the 1920s and 1930s there was a system of separate electoral curiae for Muslim and Jewish electors in Greece, with reserved seats.

===Palestine (British mandate)===
During the Mandatory Palestine, at the third election (1931) of its Assembly of Representatives, there were three curiae, for the Ashkenazi Jews, the Sephardi Jews and for the Yemeni Jews.

===Palestinian Authority===
While the Palestinian Authority makes no reservations within the Palestinian Legislative Council (there were reserved seats for Christians and Samaritans in the electoral law for the 1996 Palestinian general election), certain positions in local government are guaranteed to certain minority groups, in order to retain particular traditional cultural influence and diversity. For example, the mayor of Bethlehem is required to be a Christian, even though the city itself currently has a Muslim majority.

===Syria===
Syria enjoyed an electoral system like Lebanon&#x27;s, at least for the parliamentary elections, up to 1949, when the subdivisions among each religion were suppressed, then there were only reserved seats for Christians up to 1963, when the Ba&#x27;athist regime suppressed free elections.

===Zimbabwe===

Historically, Zimbabwe reserved 20 of the 100 seats in Parliament for the white minority, until these seats were abolished by constitutional amendment in 1987. Currently, 60 of the 270 seats in the House of Assembly are reserved for women.

==Reserved seats for expatriates==
* Algeria reserves eight of its 382 parliamentary seats for expatriates, many of whom reside in France. 
* Cape Verde has three overseas seats reserved for expatriates 
* Colombia reserves one overseas seat to represent all expatriates
* Croatia reserves no more than six seats in parliament for expatriates. The number of seats assigned to emigrants is based on participation rates in the election. 
* Ecuador has six parliamentary seats for expatriates 
* France reserves 12 seats in the Senate for expatriates, and 11 seats in the National Assembly.
* Italy reserves seats in its Parliament for Italian expatriates, with twelve members of the Chamber of Deputies and six in the Senate representing an Overseas constituency.
* Portugal&#x27;s Assembly of the Republic has four seats reserved for Portuguese living abroad, two for those living in Europe, the other two for those living in other parts of the world.

==Floating reserved seats==
* In Mauritius, the National Assembly consists of 70 members, 62 elected for a five-year term in a constituency in which 3 are elected in the constituencies of Mauritius (mainland) and 2 are elected in the constituency of Rodriques. From 4 up to 8 additional members, known as &quot;best losers&quot; appointed by the Electoral Supervisory Commission &quot;with a view to correct any imbalance in community representation in Parliament&quot;.
* New Zealand reserves a proportion of its parliamentary seats for the representation of persons electing to register on a separate Māori roll. The number of seats depends upon the number of people on the roll — there are currently seven seats. See Māori electorates.

==Exemption of the election threshold==
In several countries, political parties representing recognized ethnic minorities are exempted from the election threshold. Examples are listed below.

*Denmark: German minority party of Schleswig Party
*Germany: Danish and Frisian minorities (in Schleswig-Holstein), Sorbian minority (in Brandenburg) in fact this only applies to the South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association
*Hungary: ~0.27% threshold instead of 5% (parties which do not meet the special threshold get a )
*Montenegro: 0.7% instead of 3% for Bosniak and Albanian minorities and a special 0.35% for the Croat minority (which is lower than the natural threshold)
*Poland: German minority
*Serbia: no threshold; parties below the usual 3% threshold get their vote cast increased by 35%

==Quotas inside party lists==
* Iraq held its first post-Saddam parliamentary elections in January 2005 under an electoral law providing for compulsory integration of women on the candidates lists, like several European countries with a proportional electoral system.

<doc id="469765" wikidata="Q1051523" url="?curid=469765" title="Caudron C.714">
<text>The C.710 were a series of light fighter aircraft developed by Caudron-Renault for the French Air Force just prior to the start of World War II. One version, the C.714, saw limited production, and were assigned to Polish pilots flying in France after the fall of Poland in 1939. A small number was also supplied to Finland.

==Design and development==
The original specification that led to the C.710 series was offered in 1936 in order to quickly raise the number of modern aircraft in French service, by supplying a &quot;light fighter&quot; of wooden construction which could be built rapidly in large numbers without upsetting the production of existing types. The contract resulted in three designs, the Arsenal VG-30, the Bloch MB.700, and the C.710. Prototypes of all three were ordered.

The original C.710 was a monoplane of all-wooden construction developed from an earlier series of air racers. One common feature of these aircraft was an extremely long nose, with the cockpit far back on the fuselage. It had a fixed spatted landing gear; the vertical stabilizer was semicircular. Armament consisted of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.9 cannon under each wing in a small pod, with 60 rounds per gun. The nose housed the 336 kW (450 hp) Renault 12R-01, a supercharged inverted air-cooled V-12 engine which was developed by putting together two Renault 6Q engines. The aircraft

The C.710 prototype first flew on 18 July 1936. The C.710 had a speed of at , but the Morane-Saulnier M.S.405 was finally selected instead, mainly due to its superior rate of climb. The prototype C.710 was destroyed in a crash on 1 February 1938.

The C.711 was a proposed racing aircraft which was not built and the C.712 was a version intended to break the World Air Speed Record. It used the fuselage of the C.710 with the wing of the Caudron C.580, while its Renault 613 engine, although basically the same as that of the C.710, had its power increased to by increasing compression, allowed by the use of 100 Octane fuel. The C.712 made its first flight on 24 December 1936, but was destroyed in a crash at Istres on 29 April 1937 during a record attempt. The C.713, which flew on 15 December 1937, was a modified fighter which introduced retractable landing gear and a more conventional triangular vertical stabilizer.

The final evolution of the 710 series was the C.714 Cyclone, a variation on the C.713 which first flew in April 1938 as the C.714.01 prototype. The principal changes were a new wing airfoil section, a strengthened fuselage, and, instead of two cannon, four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wing fairings. It was powered by the newer 12R-03 version of the engine, which introduced a new carburettor which could operate in negative &quot;g&quot;.

The French Air Force ordered 20 C.714s on 5 November 1938, with options for a further 180. Production started at the Renault factory in the Paris suburbs in summer 1939.

Other projected versions were the C.720 trainer with a 75 or 164 kW (100 or 220 hp) engine, the C.760 fighter with a 559 kW (750 hp) Isotta-Fraschini Delta engine, and the C.770 fighter with a 597 kW (800 hp) Renault V-engine. None of these reached production.

==Operational history==

Deliveries did not start until January 1940. After a series of tests with the first production examples, it became apparent that the design was seriously flawed. Although light and fast, its wooden construction did not permit a more powerful engine to be fitted. The original engine seriously limited its climb rate and maneuverability with the result that the Caudron was withdrawn from active service in February 1940. In March, the initial production order was reduced to 90, as the performance was not considered good enough to warrant further production contracts. Eighty were diverted to Finland to fight in the Winter War. These were meant to be flown by French pilots.

However, events in France resulted in only six aircraft being delivered, and an additional ten were waiting in the harbour when deliveries were stopped. The six aircraft that arrived were assembled, tested and given registrations CA-551 to CA-556. The aircraft were found to be too unreliable and dangerous to use in Finnish conditions, and were not committed to combat. Two of the aircraft were damaged during a transport flight to Pori. Further, the Finnish pilots found that it was difficult to start and land the aircraft from the air bases at the front. The aircraft were maintained on the roster until they were retired and scrapped on 30 December 1949. One example, &quot;CA-556&quot; was transferred to the maintenance personnel school as an instructional airframe.

On 18 May 1940, 35 Caudrons were delivered to the Polish &quot;Warsaw Squadron&quot;, the &quot;Groupe de Chasse polonais I/145&quot;, stationed at the Mions airfield. After just 23 sorties, adverse opinion of the fighter was confirmed by frontline pilots who expressed concerns that it was seriously underpowered and was no match for contemporary German fighters.

On 25 May, only a week after it was introduced, French Minister of War Guy La Chambre ordered all C.714s to be withdrawn from active service. However, since the French authorities had no other aircraft to offer, the Polish pilots ignored the order and continued to fly the Caudrons. Despite flying a fighter hopelessly outdated compared to the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, the Polish pilots scored 12 confirmed and three unconfirmed victories in three battles between 8 June and 11 June, losing nine in the air and nine more on the ground. Among the aircraft shot down were four Dornier Do 17 bombers, and also three Messerschmitt Bf 109 and five Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters.

The Caudron fighter was also used by the Polish training squadron based in Bron near Lyon. Although the pilots managed to disperse several bombing raids, they did not score any kills; but they did not lose any aircraft either. By the end of June when France fell, only 53 production machines had been delivered (although the number varies, 98 is another common figure).

==Operators==
* Luftwaffe 20 were confiscated by the Germans.
*Finnish Air Force had 6 C.714.
*French Air Force
* Vichy French Air Force
*Polish Air Force in Exile

==Survivors==

One full CR.714 airframe as well as one additional fuselage were preserved in Finland. The fuselage was offered back to the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace&quot; where, as of 2015, it is currently undergoing restoration.

<doc id="469768" wikidata="Q1313903" url="?curid=469768" title="SuperStar (Arabic TV series)">
<text>SuperStar () was an Arabic television show based on the popular British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot; created by Simon Fuller&#x27;s 19 Entertainment &amp; developed by Fremantle Media. The show unites the Arab community by democratically choosing the next singing sensation. The show is broadcast worldwide on Future TV, a Lebanese television station. It is also the first &quot;Idol&quot; franchise to feature contestants from multiple countries.

The show was a huge success. Ali Jaber, the executive manager of Future TV, was quoted as saying &quot;This (program) is the most successful for an Arab television. There isn&#x27;t a television program that moved the Arab world like that.&quot;

However, &quot;SuperStar&quot; was eclipsed by rival show &quot;Star Academy&quot; on LBC in the Middle East, in terms of popularity and ratings, after only its first season. It has been surpassed by &quot;Star Academy&quot; as the number one Arab show, and did not move the Arab world the way it did during the first season.

Future TV subsequently lost the &quot;Idol&quot; licence to the MBC network, which in 2011 relaunched the programme after changing its name to &quot;Arab Idol&quot; on MBC 1.

lost the &quot;Idol&quot; licence to the MTV Lebanon &amp; FOX Egypt channel, which in 2011 relaunched the programme as &quot;SuperStar&quot;.

Rania Kurdi did not want to renew her hosting position for Season 3, as a result Heba Sisi was hired for Season 3, but due to the lengthy hiatus over the Hariri murder, her contract prematurely ended before the semi-finals had begun, leaving Ayman to host solo for the rest of the season.

<text>Ronald Melzack (July 19, 1929 – December 22, 2019) was a Canadian psychologist and professor of psychology at McGill University. In 1965, he and Patrick David Wall re-charged pain research by introducing the gate control theory of pain. In 1968, Melzack published an extension of the gate control theory, in which he asserted that pain is subjective and multidimensional because several parts of the brain contribute to it at the same time. During the mid-1970s, he developed the McGill Pain Questionnaire and became a founding member of the International Association for the Study of Pain. He also became the founding editor of &quot;Wall &amp; Melzack&#x27;s Textbook of Pain&quot;.

Melzack has received numerous honors including Prix du Québec (1994), the Order of Canada (1995), and the National Order of Quebec (2000). In 2010, he won the Grawemeyer Award for his research on the science of pain.

==Early life==
Melzack was born in Montreal, the son of Joseph Melzack, who worked in a clothing factory and opened a second-hand bookstore. He grew up in a working-class Jewish neighborhood. Due to financial constraint, Ron was the only sibling in his family to attend university. His brothers worked in the family bookstore known as &quot;Classic Bookshops&quot; which became a successful chain. He received his M.Sc. from McGill in 1951 and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1954. Donald O. Hebb was Melzack&#x27;s research advisor at university during the time he worked on his doctoral thesis. Hebb was doing experiments with dogs who had not been normally socialized and Melzack became interested in their unusual response to pain when they would stick their nose in a flame repeatedly. Melzack completed his post-doc at the University of Oregon.

==Career ==
After studying for his Ph.D. in 1954 with Hebb at McGill University in Montreal, he began to work with patients who suffered from &quot;phantom limb&quot; pain — people who feel pain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that pain often has little survival value, and some pains are entirely out of proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuing long after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoral student, Melzack began collecting &quot;pain words&quot; and putting them into classes that belonged together, like &quot;hot,&quot; &quot;burning,&quot; &quot;scalding,&quot; and &quot;searing&quot;.

In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices around the world. Melzack spent time at the University College of London, and the University of Pisa in Italy. He eventually became a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he met Dr. Patrick Wall. The two shared similar thoughts and ideas surrounding the phenomenon of pain. Melzack and Wall noticed that some individuals felt immense pain when damage to the body was minimal, and some people with traumatic injuries experienced little or no pain until a later time.

In 1965 at MIT, Melzack and Wall developed the gate control theory of pain which states that pain is &quot;gated&quot; or modulated by past experience. Gate control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphins and enkephalins, the body&#x27;s natural opiates. He is also noted for work on stress-induced analgesia, phantom-limb pain and the theory of neuromatrix. He proposes that we are born with a genetically determined neural network that generates the perception of the body, the sense of self, and can also generate chronic pain, even when no limbs are present.

Melzack&#x27;s recent research at McGill indicates that there are two types of pain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathways in the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such as the pain of cutting a finger, is transmitted by a group of pathways that Melzack calls the &quot;lateral&quot; system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side of its central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic back pain, is transmitted by the &quot;medial&quot; system, whose neurons pass through the central core of the brain stem.

In 1974, Melzack co-founded the first pain clinic in Canada at the Montreal General Hospital with Dr. Joseph Stratford (then Chief of Neurosurgery at the hospital and who was the medical director of the pain clinic). Melzack served as Research Director from 1974 to 2000. The clinic became part of the McGill University Health Centre which has grown to be one of the best organized centres for pain treatment in the world. Melzack also supervised graduate students at McGill, one of whom —John O&#x27;Keefe— would later go on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2014.

==Recognition==
Melzack was a founding member of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and a past president as well as an honorary life member. Melzack was a Member of the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1982), holds two Canadian honorary degrees, and was the first recipient of the E.P. Taylor Chair in Pain Studies at McGill (1986). He is the author of several textbooks on pain, and was co-editor of &quot;Handbook of Pain Assessment&quot;, 1992. He has also published books of Inuit stories and won the Canada Council Molson Prize in 1985.

He received the Prix du Québec for research in pure and applied science (1994), recognizing him as a laureate of the highest honor for a scientist in his home province. In 1995, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. Melzack has been honoured with a Killam Prize (2001). On April 29, 2009, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, in recognition of his “outstanding contributions to medical science and the improved health and well-being of people everywhere.” Melzack was the recipient of the 2010 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in psychology for his studies and explanation of experiencing pain. The International Association for the study of pain created the Ronald Melzack Lecture Award in 2010, in recognition of Melzack&#x27;s exceptional contributions to the field of pain research. In 2011, he wrote the foreword of a Ronald Melzack special issue about the influence of the Melzack&#x27;s works on
understanding of pain and daily practice. Melzack&#x27;s published articles include; Pain mechanisms: A new theory, published in Science magazine in November 1965, The McGill Pain Questionnaire: Major properties and scoring methods published in the journal Pain, in 1975, and re-published by Melzack in the Journal Anesthesiology, in 2005 and Pain and the neuromatrix in the brain, published in the Journal of Dental Education, in 2001.

<doc id="469780" wikidata="Q1428749" url="?curid=469780" title="Strongbow (cider)">
<text>Strongbow is a dry cider produced by H. P. Bulmer in the United Kingdom since 1960. Strongbow is the world&#x27;s leading cider with a 15 per cent volume share of the global cider market and a 29 per cent volume share of the UK cider market. Bulmer&#x27;s is a subsidiary of Heineken N.V., the multinational Dutch brewer who also own the sustainable cider brand Inch&#x27;s.

Strongbow was the highest selling cider in Australia and was the second-highest selling cider in North America as of 2012. Belgian-produced Strongbow Gold was introduced in Europe in response to cider&#x27;s growing popularity on the continent in 2011.

The majority of Strongbow is produced at Bulmer&#x27;s Hereford plant, although regional variations are also produced at Heineken&#x27;s cider mill in Belgium and in Australia.

==History==

Strongbow was launched in the United Kingdom by H. P. Bulmer in 1960. Bulmer named the cider after &quot;one of England&#x27;s greatest knights&quot; Richard de Clare, whose nickname &quot;Strongbow&quot; was believed to be derived from his heavy reliance on archers during his campaigns in Ireland. However, this theory is unlikely to be true because de Clare&#x27;s father, Gilbert de Clare, was originally known as &quot;Strongbow&quot;, which suggests that Richard&#x27;s nickname was actually inherited from his father. It was initially marketed as &quot;the strong cider for men&quot;.

By 1970, it was the second-highest selling cider in the world after its Bulmer&#x27;s stablemate Woodpecker. By 2001, Strongbow was among the top ten drinks by sales in pubs and bars in England and Wales.

In 2003, Bulmers was purchased by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, who in turn were taken over by Heineken in 2008. In January 2011, Heineken announced their intention to take the Strongbow brand global.

Heineken acquired the rights to Strongbow in Australia from Asahi in 2020.

==Production methods==

In the United Kingdom, Strongbow is a blend of bitter-sweet cider and culinary apples, with 50 different varieties of apple used. The apples are grown in England, although imports from France are also used when harvests are poor. It is mass-produced using modern methods and contains apple concentrate and sugar. It is fermented with a controlled yeast strain. Strongbow in the UK does not contain any artificial sweeteners, flavourings or colouring. The Bulmers Strongbow vat is the largest alcoholic container in the world, with a capacity of 1.5 million gallons (6.8 million litres).

==Variations==
In the UK, Strongbow is available on draught at 4.5% ABV and in cans and bottles at LUKA4.5% ABV. In 2012, the UK packaged versions were reduced from 5.3% ABV to 5.0% ABV.

Strongbow Gold is the variant available in mainland Europe and is available only in bottles. It was launched in May 2012, and its major markets include Italy and Hungary. It is 5% ABV and designed to be served over ice. It is over 50% apple juice, making it a similar product to Magners and Stella Cidre. It also contains glucose syrup, glucose-fructose syrup, food acidifier: malic acid, anti-oxidant: sulphur dioxide, the colouring agent: burned sugar. It is made in Belgium at Heineken&#x27;s Stassen plant. However, the version of Strongbow Gold Apple available in Slovakia contains only 25% apple juice; in that version the colouring is E150a caramel.

Strongbow is exported to numerous overseas markets. Sleeman Breweries took over the distribution rights for Canada in 2001, and is the fifth highest selling cider in the United States, where it was imported by Vermont Hard Cider until August 2012, when Heineken regained the rights. It was launched into the Australian market in 1970, and today still remains as Australia&#x27;s most popular cider. Strongbow is available in six varieties in Australia: Dry, Sweet, Original (formerly sold as &quot;Draught&quot;), Lower Carb (a low carbohydrate variety), Pear and Blossom Rosé. Foster&#x27;s Group purchased the Strongbow brand in Australia in 2003, and continues to produce, distribute &amp; market the brand. They were themselves purchased by SABMiller in 2011 before being bought out by Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2017. It is confirmed that in the Australian market, the brand will be purchased by Asahi Breweries in June 2020. Carlton &amp; United Breweries, currently have the rights to Strongbow in Australia.

In 2013, Heineken launched &quot;Strongbow Dark Fruit&quot; in the UK, which contains blackcurrant and blackberry juices. 2015 saw the introduction of &quot;Cloudy Apple&quot;, a scrumpy version of the cider. In 2020, &quot;Strongbow Rosé&quot;, a rosé-style cider, was introduced. In 2023, to coincide with another rebrand, a tropical flavour was introduced, containing mango and pineapple. In 2024, a &quot;Zest&quot; flavour (containing orange, lemon and lime) and a strawberry flavour were introduced. 

In 2014 in the US, Heineken launched two new sweeter flavours, dubbed &quot;Gold Apple&quot; and &quot;Honey &amp; Apple&quot;. Strongbow subsequently discontinued the original dry cider Strongbow flavor in the USA. The move to discontinue the original dry cider recipe in the US and replace it with two sweeter varieties was criticized by some vocal customers, with comments related to the discontinuation appearing on various internet forums, the Strongbow Facebook page, and the USA Heineken Strongbow web page. However, in May 2018, Heineken announced that it would bring back the original dry cider to the United States in 16.9-ounce cans, which it did the following month.

In 2015 in the US, a variety pack was released, which includes the two existing flavors &quot;Gold Apple&quot; and &quot;Honey &amp; Apple&quot; along with two additional flavors &quot;Red Berries&quot; and &quot;Ginger.&quot; &quot;Cherry Blossom&quot; was introduced in 2016.

In 2022, a low-calorie variant, Strongbow Ultra, was introduced. The initial flavour of this variant, Dark Fruit, contained 95 calories per can, 30% fewer than the regular version of the Dark Fruit flavour. In 2023, Strongbow introduced an apple flavour to the range; the apple flavour contains 80 calories per can, 36% fewer than the Original flavour.

==Discontinued brand extensions==

In the late 80s to early 90s Strongbow produced and marketed a double fermented cider &quot;1080&quot; – said to be its specific gravity.

The late 1990s briefly gave us Strongbow smooth – carbonated with nitrogen instead of carbon dioxide, so much smaller bubbles and a smooth, creamy texture.

Previously Strongbow White was available in Australia, which had a much higher alcohol content (8.5%). It ceased production sometime after 2000.

&quot;Strongbow Sirrus&quot; (5% ABV), was launched in summer 2005 to compete with C&amp;C&#x27;s Magners Irish Cider. Sirrus was formulated as a &#x27;smooth&#x27; cider designed to be poured over ice, and was only available in bottles; it has since been discontinued.

In 2007, the company began trials of &quot;Strongbow On Ice&quot;, a competitor to other ciders that are served over ice. This uses a specially designed pump that creates a &quot;head&quot; of ice made from cider on the top of the pint. Trials were unsuccessful however, and the product was discontinued.

Strongbow Black (previously Strongbow Super) at 7.5% ABV, was delisted by Heineken in 2011 on social responsibility grounds.

In 2013, Strongbow briefly produced &#x27;Strongbow Original&#x27; which was the same as is currently sold, rather having a matte can. 

In 2014, &quot;Strongbow Citrus Edge&quot; was introduced, which contained lemon and lime. This was discontinued in 2017.

==Advertising==
The original Norman archer logo was designed by graphic artist Barney Bubbles. The &quot;thudding arrows&quot; have been a signature of the brand&#x27;s television advertising since the 1960s. Towards the end of the advertisement, two arrows thud into a bar counter near a glass of Strongbow, or its bar pump.

Advertisements from 1998 to 2002 featured Johnny Vaughan and the &quot;live to loaf&quot; line. The campaign focused on Vaughan&#x27;s character, who was always finding new ways to get the most out of life with the minimum effort. Vaughan was credited by Bulmers with giving credibility to the Strongbow brand among the key 18 to 24-year-old group. Between 1998 and 2000 Strongbow sales rose by 30 per cent.

In 2010, TV adverts in the UK were based on the &quot;medal ceremony&quot; scene at the end of the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope&quot; (1977): three men walk down an aisle flanked by large numbers of men; step up a raised podium at the far end; and receive a reward – a pint of Strongbow – for their &quot;heroic deeds&quot; (i.e.: performing their ordinary jobs). Adverts in 2012, showed fanciful representations of normal situations (goalkeeping, potting a black ball, best man&#x27;s speech) where those seen in the advert would be next seen drinking Strongbow having &quot;earnt it&quot; for accomplishing such situations. The latest advert depicts a duplex-style apple orchard divided between bitter and sweet reflecting Strongbow being &quot;bittersweet by nature&quot;.

In 2015, Strongbow began its &quot;Cider at its Bestest&quot; campaign in the US, featuring Patrick Stewart.

The most recent campaigns for Strongbow include one for the Strongbow Ultra variant which incorporates the theme &quot;Drink the G.O.A.T.&quot; and a rebrand advert showing a fancy dress party with the attendants wearing very silly costumes (i.e. a sardine can)

===Sponsorship===
Strongbow were official shirt sponsors of Edinburgh football club Heart of Midlothian from 1992–2002. Strongbow also sponsored Leeds United Football Club from 2000–2003. Strongbow reputedly paid £3 million a year for the rights.

<text>Diego Marani (born 1959) is an Italian novelist and European civil servant.

==Biography==
Born in Tresigallo, Marani attended the Liceo Ginnasio Ariosto in Ferrara till 1978 and graduated in interpretation and translation from the &quot;Scuola superiore di lingue moderne per traduttori e interpreti&quot; in Trieste in 1983. Upon graduation, he worked as a freelance interpreter and translator as well as a freelance journalist for various local newspapers. Besides English and French, he later studied professionally Dutch, Finnish, Slovene and German languages.

In 1985 Marani started working at the EU Council (DGT) as a translator and revisor, a position he maintained until 2006, when he joined the European Commission&#x27;s Directorate-General for Culture, and from 2010 the Directorate-General for Interpretation, working in particular on multilingualism policy, support to literary translation, lifelong learning and early language learning. In this period he also served as speechwriter for Leonard Orban, Manuel Barroso, Antonio Tajani, Androulla Vassiliou.
In 2014 he served as adviser to the Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini during the Italian Presidency of the EU Council. Since 2015 Marani has worked for the European External Action Service, coordinating cultural diplomacy initiatives.

In 1996, while working as a translator for the Council of the European Union, he invented Europanto, a mock international auxiliary language. Marani has published different articles, short stories and video clips in Europanto.

Marani is also an essayist and novelist. His most famous novel, &quot;New Finnish Grammar&quot; (&quot;Nuova grammatica finlandese&quot;), has been translated into several languages and has received the Grinzane Cavour literary prize in Italy. His other novels include &quot;Las Adventures des Inspector Cabillot&quot; (1998, written in Europanto), &quot;L&#x27;ultimo dei Vostiach&quot; (Premio Campiello, Selezione Giurati) (&quot;The Last of the Vostiaks&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;interprete&quot;, &quot;Il compagno di scuola&quot;, and &quot;Enciclopedia tresigallese&quot;. As an essayist, Marani wrote &quot;A Trieste con Svevo&quot; and &quot;Come ho imparato le lingue&quot;. His book, &quot;La bicicletta incantata&quot;, was made into a movie by Elisabetta Sgarbi, editor in chief of Bompiani publishing house and art producer. A more recent novel of Marani&#x27;s, &quot;Il cane di Dio&quot;, was published in 2012 and issued in English as &quot;God&#x27;s Dog&quot; in that year as well. &quot;Lavorare manca&quot; was published in 2014. Marani also regularly writes for the cultural page of the Italian daily &quot;Il Sole 24 Ore&quot; and is a blogger on eunews.it.

<doc id="469782" wikidata="Q2645602" url="?curid=469782" title="Joint premiers of the Province of Canada">
<text>Joint premiers of the Province of Canada were the prime ministers of the Province of Canada, from the 1841 unification of Upper Canada and Lower Canada until Confederation in 1867.

Following the abortive Rebellions of 1837, Lord Durham was appointed governor in chief of British North America. In his 1839 &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot;, he recommended that Upper and Lower Canada be united under a single Parliament, with responsible government. As a result, in 1841, the first Parliament of the Province of Canada was convened.

Although &quot;Canada East&quot; (the former Lower Canada, now Quebec) and &quot;Canada West&quot; (the former Upper Canada, now Ontario) were united as a single province with a single government, each administration was led by two men, one from each half of the province. Officially, one of them at any given time had the title of &quot;Premier&quot;, while the other had the title of &quot;Deputy&quot;. Despite this, however, the titular premier could not generally invoke unilateral authority over his deputy if he wanted to maintain his government&#x27;s stability; in practice, both men had to agree on virtually any political course of action. As a result, this form of government proved to be fractious and difficult, leading to frequent changes in leadership — in just 26 years, the joint premiership changed hands eighteen times, with twenty different people holding the office over its history even though just eight general elections were held across that time.

With the introduction of responsible government in 1848, Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine became the first truly democratic leaders of what would eventually become the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in present-day Canada, and some modern historians, most notably John Ralston Saul, have promoted the idea that they should be viewed as Canada&#x27;s true first Prime Ministers.

==Evolution of party politics==
In earlier years, the political groups were loose affiliations rather than modern political parties. The &quot;reformers&quot; allied under the banner of &quot;Reformers&quot; in Canada West and &quot;Patriotes&quot; in Canada East, while the &quot;conservatives,&quot; meaning supporters of the elite &quot;Family Compact&quot; in Canada West and &quot;Château Clique&quot; in Canada East prior to unification, were known as &quot;Tories&quot;. Although informal alliances existed between each ideological pair, these alliances were not political parties as they exist today.

1854, however, proved a pivotal year in the evolution of Canadian politics. Although the &quot;Rouges&quot; and the &quot;Liberals&quot; had already emerged in Canada East, these were relatively fringe groups. In 1854, however, many dissatisfied voters in Canada West turned to the more radical &quot;Clear Grit&quot; faction, and in order to stay in power traditional reformers in Canada East, led by Augustin-Norbert Morin, entered a coalition with Allan Napier MacNab&#x27;s conservatives in Canada West.

The early reformers ultimately dissolved as a political entity. Moderate reformers joined the new &quot;Liberal-Conservative&quot; party, later to become the Conservative Party, while the Clear Grits aligned with the Liberals and the Rouges to create the modern Liberal Party, thereby creating the political party structure that prevails today.

The pattern of new protest parties emerging from time to time, and becoming integrated into the mainstream of Canadian political life, was also established by this realignment. Later groups included the Progressives, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.

==Continuing influence==
The best-known premiership has arguably been the Macdonald–Cartier ministry, which governed the Province of Canada from 1857 to 1862 (except for four days in 1858 when power was briefly ceded to the Brown–Dorion government). It was during their ministry that the first organized moves toward Canadian Confederation took place, and John A. Macdonald himself became the first Prime Minister of Canada in 1867. Macdonald-Cartier has survived in Canada as a geographic and institutional name, which has been applied to high schools in Ottawa, Sudbury and Saint-Hubert, the Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport and the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge linking Ottawa with Gatineau. &quot;Macdonald–Cartier Freeway&quot; was also the historical name of Highway 401.

The Lafontaine–Baldwin government has also lent its name to the annual LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium on Canadian social, cultural and political topics. No other joint premiership currently has any Canadian institutions or geographic features named for it &quot;per se&quot;, although individual people who held the position may be so honoured as individuals.

The continuing, although informal, government position of the Quebec lieutenant, who is designated as the Prime Minister&#x27;s primary advisor and spokesman on issues related to Quebec, may be viewed as an indirect descendant of the joint premiership, although the position is far from equivalent in terms of the actual power it wields within a government.

<doc id="469788" wikidata="Q780486" url="?curid=469788" title="Byssus">
<text>A byssus () is a bundle of filaments secreted by many species of bivalve mollusc that function to attach the mollusc to a solid surface. Species from several families of clams have a byssus, including pen shells (Pinnidae), true mussels (Mytilidae), and Dreissenidae.

==Filaments==
Byssus filaments are created by certain kinds of marine and freshwater bivalve mollusks, which use the byssus to attach themselves to rocks, substrates, or seabeds. In edible mussels, the inedible byssus is commonly known as the &quot;beard&quot;, and is removed before cooking.

Many species of mussels secrete byssus threads to anchor themselves to surfaces, with families including the Mytilidae, Arcidae, Anomiidae, Pinnidae, Pectinidae, Dreissenidae, and Unionidae.

==Mechanics==
The byssus, or byssal complex, is composed of multiple extracellular collagenous threads that are placed radially by the mussel from a central stem. Each thread is composed of three regions: a corrugated proximal region close to the mussel body, a longer, smooth distal region connecting the proximal region to the ending plaque, and the adhesive plaque itself, which anchors the mussel to the surface. The proximal region consists of a corrugated sheath enveloping loosely-arranged coiled fibers; these coils can unravel to extend the fiber under an applied force. The distal region is more ordered, consisting of aligned collagenous fiber bundles that give the fiber stiffness. The plaque consists of collagen-like fibers over a spongy matrix, in which the adhesive protein is deposited and hardens.

The purpose of the byssus is to keep the mussel attached to the desired surface, and to this end byssal threads must be able to withstand strong cyclic motion due to tidal action near the shorelines mussels inhabit. Mechanical testing of live mussels has shown that byssal threads can extend 39% before yield and 64% before breaking, at a nominal strain rate of 10 mm/min. Tensile testing shows that threads exhibit three distinct phases: initial stiffness from both the distal and proximal regions, softening due to yield in the distal region, and finally stiffening directly preceding tensile failure. The ability of the distal region to yield before breaking gives the mussels their characteristic hardiness even under strong tidal forces. Many variables that influence the performance of byssal threads have been studied, including species variations, seasonal variations, temperature effects, and ageing effects. Temperature effects in particular have revealed a glass transition temperature of 6 °C.

The number of threads used by a mussel to attach is typically between 20 and 60; this can vary by the species, season, or age of the mussel. Under cyclic tidal conditions, the radial spread of fiber placement allows the mussel to dynamically align most of its fibers in the direction of applied force. This lowers the stress on any one thread, reducing the chances of failure and detachment. Mussels are also capable of ejecting the entire byssal complex, including the central stem, without damaging themselves. The complex can simply be regenerated and with fibers placement resuming within 24 hours.

When a mussel&#x27;s foot encounters a crevice, it creates a vacuum chamber by forcing out the air and arching up, similar to a plumber&#x27;s plunger unclogging a drain. The byssus, which is made of keratin, quinone-tanned proteins (polyphenolic proteins), and other proteins, is spewed into this chamber in a liquid form similar to injection moulding in polymer processing, and bubbles into a sticky foam. By curling its foot into a tube and pumping the foam, the mussel produces sticky threads about the size of a human hair. The mussel then varnishes the threads with another protein, resulting in an adhesive. The attachment dynamics of the plaque are studied both to imitate the strong adhesive and to create coatings to which the plaque cannot adhere. Foul release strategies such as fluoropolymer paints and lubricant-infused coatings are an active research area important to preventing the fouling of marine structures by invasive mussel species such as the zebra and quagga mussel.

==Biomimetics==
Byssus is a remarkable adhesive, one that is neither degraded nor deformed by water as many synthetic adhesives are. The remarkable properties of this adhesive, specifically the mussel foot proteins (Mfps), has spurred many attempts to imitate the excellent adhesive capacity that mussels show, either by producing Mfps via other organisms or by creating synthetic polymers with similar properties. For instance, genetic engineers have inserted mussel DNA into yeast cells to translate the genes into the appropriate proteins. Synthetic approaches generally utilize catechol as a cross-linking agent to produce wear-resistant polymer networks. Imitation of Mfp-3 to induce coacervation is another key property, as this protects the material from partial dissolution in saltwater.The protein structure of byssus is reminiscent of that of silk produced by insects. Other examples of biomimetic approaches for creating mussel-inspired adhesives use these polymers as a backbone.

Applications of biomimetic byssus adhesive include biomedical adhesives, therapeutic applications, and anti-fouling coatings.

==Historical uses==
Byssus often refers to the long, fine, silky threads secreted by the large Mediterranean pen shell, &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;. The byssus threads from this &quot;Pinna&quot; species can be up to in length and have historically been made into cloth. Byssus cloth is a rare fabric, also known as sea silk, that is made using the byssus of pen shells as the fiber source. The byssus of &quot;Atrina pectinata&quot;, a shell of the same family, has been used in Sardinia as a substitute for critically endangered &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, to weave sea silk.

<doc id="469794" wikidata="Q872948" url="?curid=469794" title="To Tell the Truth">
<text>To Tell the Truth is an American television panel show. Four celebrity panelists are presented with three contestants (the &quot;team of challengers&quot;, each an individual or pair) and must identify which is the &quot;central character&quot; whose unusual occupation or experience has been read aloud by the show&#x27;s host. When the panelists question the contestants, the two impostors may lie whereas the &quot;central character&quot; must tell the truth. The setup adds the impostor element to the format of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;.

The show was created by Bob Stewart and originally produced by Mark Goodson–Bill Todman Productions. It first aired on CBS from 1956 to 1968 with Bud Collyer as host. From 1969 to 1978, the show was revived in syndication, with Garry Moore as the first host. Former panelist and frequent guest host Joe Garagiola took over in 1977, following Moore&#x27;s health issues. Garagiola hosted until the show&#x27;s cancellation.

Robin Ward hosted a 1980–81 syndicated revival of the program, and a 1990–91 revival on NBC featured a succession of different hosts: Gordon Elliott, Lynn Swann and Alex Trebek. The show was revived again in syndication from 2000 to 2002 with John O&#x27;Hurley as host. The most recent version aired on ABC from 2016 to 2022 with Anthony Anderson as host.

==Basic rules==
Although there have been some variations in the rules over the years (including the addition of a secondary game in some versions), certain basic aspects have remained consistent throughout all versions of &quot;To Tell the Truth.&quot; Three challengers are introduced, all claiming to be the central character. The announcer typically asks the challengers, who stand side by side, &quot;What is your name, please?&quot; Each challenger then states, &quot;My name is [central character&#x27;s name].&quot; The celebrity panelists then read along as the host reads aloud a signed affidavit about the central character.

The panelists are each given a period of time to question the challengers. Questions are directed to the challengers by number (designated &quot;Number One,&quot; &quot;Number Two&quot; and &quot;Number Three&quot;), with the central character sworn to give truthful answers, and the impostors permitted to lie and pretend to be the central character.

After questioning is complete, each member of the panel votes on which of the challengers he or she believes to be the central character, either by writing the number on a card or holding up a card with the number of their choice, without consulting the other panelists. Any panelist who knows one of the challengers or has another unfair advantage is required to recuse or disqualify themselves, which, for scoring purposes, is counted as an incorrect vote. They would also sit out of the questioning.

Once the votes are in, the host asks, &quot;Will the real [person&#x27;s name] please stand up?&quot; The central character then stands, often after some brief playful feinting and false starts among all three challengers. Occasionally, the central character would be asked to do something else related to his or her story instead of standing up. The two impostors then reveal their real names and their actual occupations. Prize money is awarded and divided among all three of the challengers, based on the number of incorrect votes received by the impostors.

==History==
===1956–1968, CBS===
&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; was to have premiered on Tuesday, December 18, 1956, on CBS in primetime as &quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot;, but the program title was changed to &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; the day before the show&#x27;s debut. (There was one pilot episode titled &quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot;; both the planned and eventual titles derive from the standard English court oath &quot;to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&quot;)

The series was recorded in New York City, initially at CBS Studio 52 (the future Studio 54), before moving to the Ed Sullivan Theater late in its run. The existence of an audience ticket for a taping indicates that the show originated in color at the CBS Broadcast Center in late 1966.

Bud Collyer was the show&#x27;s host (Mike Wallace hosted the pilot); recurring panelists by the 1960s included Tom Poston, Peggy Cass, Orson Bean, and Kitty Carlisle. (Cass and Carlisle stayed on as panelists for most subsequent editions.) Earlier regular panelists included Johnny Carson, Polly Bergen, Jayne Meadows, Don Ameche, Hy Gardner, Dick Van Dyke, Faye Emerson, Hildy Parks, John Cameron Swayze, Betty White, and Ralph Bellamy. Bern Bennett, Collyer&#x27;s announcer on &quot;Beat the Clock,&quot; was the inaugural announcer of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in the 1950s. Upon Bennett&#x27;s transfer to CBS&#x27;s Los Angeles studios, Johnny Olson, who in time became the best-known of all Goodson–Todman Productions announcers, joined the show in 1960 and remained with the show until 1972.

On the pilot and the primetime run, three games were played per episode. For the pilot, a wrong vote from each of the four-member panel and one wrong vote derived from the majority vote of the audience (a total of five votes) paid $300, the total prize money divided among the three challengers. The studio audience also voted, with the majority vote counting equally with that of one by a celebrity panelist; thus, the maximum of five incorrect votes resulted in $1,500 divided among the challengers. If there was a tie for the highest vote from the audience, and for each panelist who was disqualified, a wrong vote was counted. There was no consolation prize for no wrong votes.

For the majority of the primetime run there was no audience vote, thus each wrong vote from the four-member panel paid $250, divided among the three challengers, for a possible $1,000 for a complete stump of four wrong answers. A consolation prize of $150 was awarded and divided among the three challengers if there were no wrong votes. For each panelist who was disqualified, a wrong vote was counted. A design element in the set for this series was a platform situated directly above and behind the emcee&#x27;s desk. The contestants stood on this platform during their introduction, allowing the camera to pan directly down to the host. They then traveled down a curved staircase to the main stage level to play the game. Some subsequent versions would use a variation of the original set design; others did not and had all the action at floor level.

On Monday, June 18, 1962, a daytime five-day-per-week edition was introduced, running at 3 p.m. Eastern Time. The daytime show, also hosted by Collyer, featured a separate panel for its first three years, with actress Phyllis Newman as the only regular. The evening panel took over the afternoon show in 1965; in early 1968, Bert Convy replaced Poston in the first chair.

The daytime show was reduced to two games to accommodate a five-minute CBS news bulletin towards the half-hour mark. On the CBS daytime run, each wrong vote paid the three challengers $100 for a possible total of $400 divided among the three challengers for a &quot;complete stump&quot; of all four wrong votes. If all the votes were correct, the challengers split a consolation prize of $75. During the show&#x27;s final year and a half, the studio audience also voted, with the majority vote counting equally with that of one of the celebrity panelists, thus a maximum of $500 divided among the challengers could be awarded for the maximum five incorrect votes. If there was a tie for the highest vote from the audience, and for each panelist who was disqualified, a wrong vote was counted. The audience vote was utilized on the nighttime show for its final six episodes (increasing the maximum possible payout to $1,250).
One CBS daytime episode featuring Dorothy Kilgallen, best known as a regular panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, was broadcast in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones on Monday, November 8, 1965, as news of her sudden death was circulated by wire services. The breaking news story prompted CBS newscaster Douglas Edwards to announce her death immediately after the episode ended. She had videotaped the program six days earlier, according to the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. The newspaper added that Kilgallen and Arlene Francis both pretended to be Joan Crawford while sitting next to the real Crawford in a celebrity segment that the daytime series featured regularly starting in 1965. The episode was one of the large majority of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; daytime episodes that were destroyed because of the common practice of wiping videotape for reuse, prior to the development of less expensive technology. This was a different half-hour telecast from the 1962 primetime episode on which Kilgallen can be seen and heard as one of the panelists. Game Show Network repeated that episode decades later.

The primetime show ended on May 22, 1967, with the daytime show ending on September 6, 1968. The latter was replaced by the expansions of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light,&quot; the last two remaining 15-minute programs on daytime television, to 30 minutes apiece, in a scheduling shuffle with &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, and &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party.&quot; Like the primetime version, the daytime show&#x27;s popularity underwent a steady decline toward the end of its run, as it faced two popular daytime dramas on ABC and NBC, &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Another World,&quot; respectively.

Metropole Orchestra leader Dolf van der Linden composed the show&#x27;s first theme, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, used from 1956 to 1961. From 1961 to 1967, the show switched to a Bob Cobert-penned theme with a beat similar to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and then to a Score Productions tune during its final CBS daytime season.

Most episodes of the original nighttime run of the series were preserved on black-and-white kinescope, along with a few color videotape episodes. Only a handful of shows remain from the CBS daytime series&#x27; first three years because of the then-common practice of wiping videotapes and reusing them due to their high cost and limited storage space. Many daytime episodes (including some in color) from 1966 to 1968 exist, including the color finale.

Reruns of the black-and-white kinescopes have been shown on Buzzr and Game Show Network.

===1969–1978, syndication===
&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; returned only a year later, in autumn of 1969, in first-run syndication. During the early years of its run, the syndicated &quot;Truth&quot; became a highly-rated component of stations&#x27; early-evening schedules after the Federal Communications Commission imposed the Prime Time Access Rule in 1971, opening up at least a half hour (a full hour, usually, on Eastern Time Zone stations) to fill with non-network fare between either the local or network evening newscast and the start of their networks&#x27; primetime schedules for the evening. Other stations found success running the program in place of a daytime network game or soap opera, or in the afternoon fringe time period between the end of network daytime programming at 4:30/3:30 Central and the evening newscasts.

Like the network editions that preceded it, the syndicated &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; taped its episodes in New York for its entire run. Initially occupying the same studio space at the Ed Sullivan Theater that it had for the last few years of the network series, the show would eventually move operations to NBC&#x27;s studios
at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the early 1970s.

Each wrong vote in this version was worth $50 to the challengers; complete stumps of the entire panel won the challengers a total of $500. There were two games per episode, and there was often a live demonstration or video clip to illustrate the central character&#x27;s story after many of the games.

The show was first released to local stations on September 8, 1969. A total of 1,715 episodes of this version were produced, with the series ending on September 7, 1978. Some markets that added the series after its initial 1969 release opted to carry the show for another season or two after 1978 in order to catch up on the episodes that had not aired in their viewing area.

To host the revival series, Goodson and Todman made a call to original host Bud Collyer; however, Collyer had been suffering from a series of health issues that led to his death on the day the 1969 series premiered, and he told them &quot;I&#x27;m just not up to it.&quot; The next call they made was to Garry Moore, the former host of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; as well as the CBS variety series &quot;The Garry Moore Show.&quot; Moore had largely been away from television since his variety series was cancelled in 1964 (he left &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; around the same time), but he decided the time was right to return and he accepted the offer to host the new series. Regular panelists included Orson Bean during the first year, Peggy Cass, Kitty Carlisle and Bill Cullen, who was also the designated substitute host whenever necessary. Many regulars from the original run appeared, including Tom Poston and Bert Convy. Semi-regulars during the 1968–73 time period included Gene Rayburn, Joe Garagiola, Alan Alda, Tony Roberts and Nipsey Russell.

In late 1976, during the eighth season, Moore was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and left for the remainder of the season to deal with his illness. As he had done numerous times before, Bill Cullen became his replacement. As Cullen&#x27;s time as host continued on, Mark Goodson noted how Cullen&#x27;s serving as host, rather than as a panelist, hurt the chemistry he had shared with Cass and Carlisle. A decision was made to have Cullen return to the panel permanently and give semi-regular panelist Joe Garagiola the hosting position. Using a baseball term for &quot;substitute,&quot; Garagiola stated that he was &quot;pinch hitter&quot; for Moore, who returned to the series for a farewell performance on the ninth-season premiere in 1977. Moore explained why he had left the program, then after presiding over one last game, announced his final retirement from television and handed the host position to Garagiola permanently. &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; ended production at the end of the season.

Johnny Olson stayed with &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; when it moved to syndication. He left in 1972, when he moved to Los Angeles to announce the Goodson-Todman revivals of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret.&quot; NBC staff announcer Bill Wendell succeeded Olson from 1972 to 1977, with Alan Kalter taking over during the final season. Don Pardo, also an NBC staff announcer, served as a backup to Wendell and Kalter.

&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; used three distinctive sets throughout its nine-year syndicated run. The first, designed by Theodore Cooper and making heavy use of the psychedelic art styles popular in the period, was used for the first two seasons and the first four weeks of the third; those designs were muted somewhat with pastel shades on the second set used from that point through the first 30 weeks of the fourth season. The third—and longest-lived—set, which Cooper also designed, was a mostly-blue block motif with gold accents, and included a large on-stage representation of the show&#x27;s new logo, which made use of stacking and interlocking letters, behind the panel. This set was used for the remainder of the run, and the logo would be reused on the future 1990 revival.

This version featured a lyrical, pop music-styled theme song written and composed by Score Productions chief Bob Israel and &quot;Truth&quot; producer Paul Alter, along with veteran theme composer Charles Fox; an instrumental, and orchestral, version would be used for the 1990 series.

The bulk of this version is intact. However, the current status of the first season is unknown, and is presumed to be lost to wiping. GSN has never rerun the first season of the show, and had always begun with the second season, in 1970. One episode from the first season exists in the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Buzzr began airing episodes from 1973 in October 2018.

On the October 5, 1973, episode, one of the challengers was Georg Olden, who disclosed that he was the graphic designer who created the &quot;To Tell the Truth man&quot; icon that was used during the 1956–1978 seasons.

===1980–1981, syndication===

On September 8, 1980, a new &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; series premiered in syndication. The new series emanated once again from Rockefeller Plaza in New York, and Canadian TV personality Robin Ward served as the host, with Alan Kalter returning as announcer. A new theme and set were commissioned for this edition of &quot;Truth.&quot; Even though previous regulars Bill Cullen, Peggy Cass, and Kitty Carlisle made frequent appearances, there was no regular panel for this edition. The new &quot;Truth&quot; aired for one season in syndication, but it never recaptured the popularity of the original, and aired its final episode on June 12, 1981, with reruns airing until September 11, 1981.

Two games were played, and each wrong vote paid the challengers $100; $500 was paid if the entire panel had been fooled. No consolation prize was given if the entire panel correctly identified the subject.

After the second game, a new game called &quot;One on One&quot; was played with the four impostors from earlier. One fact had been purposely withheld from the panel about one of the impostors and it was up to the panelists to determine correctly to which of the impostors it applied. One at a time, each panelist would be given twenty seconds to question the impostor sitting directly across from him or her and would then say whether he or she believed the fact applied to that impostor. Wrong votes still paid $100, with $500 paid if the panel did not correctly determine to whom the fact pertained.

The 1980 edition of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; was a rarity in that it was still based in New York while nearly all television game show production had moved to California by this point. There was only one other game show in production during the run of this &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; series that emanated from New York. &quot;The $50,000 Pyramid&quot;, which premiered at the midway point of the 1980-81 season, was the other; the series was taped at ABC’s Studio TV-15, the former Elysee Theater, on West 58th Street. These two would be the last non-cable productions to tape regularly in New York until 1999 when &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; premiered on ABC.

===1990–1991, NBC===
&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; returned to NBC for a run that lasted only eight months, from September 3, 1990 (Labor Day) to May 31, 1991. Unlike previous versions that originated from New York, the 1990 version was taped at NBC&#x27;s The Burbank Studios in California. The show&#x27;s theme music was an orchestral remix of the 1969–78 theme (minus the lyrics), and the show utilized the block-letter logo from 1973 to 1978. All episodes of this series exist and have aired on GSN in reruns.

Actor Richard Kline hosted two pilot episodes with Charlie O&#x27;Donnell as announcer; one of these was accidentally aired as the premiere episode in the Eastern and Central time zones. Australian &quot;A Current Affair&quot; reporter Gordon Elliott hosted &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; for its first eight weeks (September 3 to October 26, 1990). The bespectacled Elliott bore a passing resemblance to former &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; emcee and panelist Bill Cullen. A dispute with Elliott&#x27;s former employers in Australia temporarily forced him off American television altogether; his replacement was then-frequent panelist Lynn Swann. Swann, the first African-American host of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, hosted the show for the next 14 weeks (October 29, 1990 to February 1, 1991) until his job as a reporter for ABC Sports at the time forced him to leave. Alex Trebek was brought in as his replacement for the remainder of the run (February 4 to May 31, 1991), at the same time he was hosting &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; on NBC and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in syndication. Mark Goodson filled in for two episodes Trebek missed when his wife Jean went into labor during a taping with their son Matthew. The announcer for the 1990 series was Burton Richardson (O&#x27;Donnell served as his substitute).

The celebrity panelists for &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; during this period included several of the 1970s panel stalwarts, including Kitty Carlisle, who appeared on a majority of the shows, taking the fourth and most upstage seat. The first seat, furthest downstage, saw Ron Masak and Orson Bean alternate on the panel for 34 of the 39 weeks the series was on air. The chair next to that was occupied by rotating guests, although voice actress Dana Hill appeared in the seat most often. The third chair most often featured David Niven Jr. as a panelist, although Masak and Bean would also sit there if both were to appear on the same program. Polly Bergen and Peggy Cass, who began appearing on the original series, would appear from time to time, and other frequent panelists included Vicki Lawrence, Cindy Adams, and Betty White. The panelists were introduced in twos, with the male panelists escorting the female panelists down the set&#x27;s main staircase, followed by the host. For one week, Monty Hall (who would later replace Bob Hilton as a permanent guest host on the 1990 version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;) sat in the first seat.

Two games were played with two sets of impostors. Any incorrect votes up to two paid $1,000. If three of the panelists had voted incorrectly, the players split $1,500. On the pilot, each incorrect vote earned $500. If the panel was fooled entirely, the players split $3,000.

After the second game, a new version of the &quot;One on One&quot; game from the 1980 series was played. A seventh civilian player was brought out with two stories, and a member of the studio audience was given an opportunity to win money by trying to figure out which of the two stories was true. Each panelist was given the opportunity to ask the contestant one question for each story, and after both stories had been presented the audience member chose which one he or she thought was the truth. After the choice was made, the contestant revealed the right answer and if the audience member came up with it, he or she won $500. If the contestant stumped the audience member, that player won $1,000.

Occasionally, celebrities whose faces were not well known would attempt to stump the audience during this part of the game. For example, Hank Ketcham, the creator of &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and a challenger on the original &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in May 1962, tried during the show&#x27;s Christmas Day episode to convince an audience member that he was really the songwriter to &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (Johnny Marks had actually done this), but was unsuccessful in doing so.

===2000–2002, syndication===
The show then had a two-year run in syndication, starting in 2000, with John O&#x27;Hurley hosting, and Burton Richardson returning as the announcer. The series was again produced at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. Gary Stockdale supplied the music for this edition. In most markets, it was paired up with &quot;Family Feud&quot;, which was then hosted by Louie Anderson; O&#x27;Hurley would eventually join that program in 2006 and host it until 2010, when Steve Harvey took over.

Actor Meshach Taylor was the only regular to appear on every episode of this edition, while Paula Poundstone was a regular during the first season. Panelists appearing in at least six weeks of episodes included Brooke Burns, Dave Coulier, Brad Sherwood, Traci Bingham, Kim Coles, and Cindy Margolis. The show&#x27;s website touted Coles and Burns as regulars for season two in place of Poundstone, though neither panelist was featured in every show that year. Kitty Carlisle appeared as a panelist for one episode in the first season, making her the only panelist to have appeared on all incarnations of this show to that point. It was Carlisle&#x27;s final appearance in the franchise before her death in 2007.

This edition of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; brought back the audience vote that the original series had last used. Its vote was revealed after the panel had cast their votes, just before O&#x27;Hurley asked for the subject to identify himself or herself. Each incorrect vote paid $1,000, with a maximum of $5,000 available if the challengers managed to completely fool both the panel and the audience. (A tie in the audience vote or panel disqualification counted as a wrong vote, as they had in previous versions.) In the first several weeks of shows, a game that resulted in five incorrect votes was worth $10,000 for the challengers.

According to Steve Beverly&#x27;s tvgameshows.net, this edition of &quot;Truth&quot; never received a rating higher than 1.8. It was cancelled on January 28, 2002, only 96 episodes into its second season. However, repeats continued to air through March 15, 2002. Episodes of this series have aired on GSN in reruns.

===2016–2022, ABC===
ABC ordered six episodes of the show, hosted by Anthony Anderson, which taped in July 2015 and began airing on ABC on June 14, 2016. Anderson is the second African-American host of the franchise; the first was Lynn Swann on the short-lived 1990 NBC daytime version.

The new, weekly 60-minute primetime series, while maintaining the show&#x27;s core gameplay elements, presented itself as more of a comedy series. Most notably, it refocused the competition on the panelists themselves, who received points for correctly identifying the central character(s) in each round; at show&#x27;s end, the winning panelist was briefly recognized while the &quot;loser&quot; was made to suffer a small comical humiliation. No mention was ever made on-air as to compensation to the central characters or impostors. 

Also appearing on the new series was Doris Day Bowman, Anderson&#x27;s mother, presented as the &quot;scorekeeper.&quot; In some cases, where a panelist knows the central character or one of the impostors, Bowman also plays on their behalf. When Anderson&#x27;s family appeared on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, the behavior of &quot;Mama Doris&quot; was so outrageous that the producers approached Anderson about having her on &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;. 

The first season also included a house band, Cheche and His Band of Liars, and David Scott as an offstage announcer; these were replaced in season 2 by prerecorded music and an introduction provided by Anderson himself.

In this version, most contestants introduce themselves solely by claiming the central character&#x27;s story, rather than by name (e.g., &quot;I was a Bond girl&quot; rather than &quot;My name is ...&quot;); some panels have contestants of different genders. The questioning period is not split distinctly among the panelists, and Anderson and Bowman often participate in the questioning.

Five rounds were played per episode, along with one additional round entitled &quot;Before You Go&quot;, which was played with the two impostors of the just-completed round, one of whom had their own story. 

Many episodes include a demonstration by one of the central characters. 

==== Scoring ====
Panelists receive 10 points for correctly identifying the central character in each round, or 20 points for the final round (1 and 2 points in earlier episodes).

At the end of the episode, the losing panelist is subjected to some sort of minor humiliation; if panelists are tied, Bowman chooses the loser. In season one, the losing panelist was subjected to &quot;Tweet a Lie,&quot; in which Anderson posted an embarrassing tweet to that panelist&#x27;s Twitter account. In later episodes, the panelist was awarded a &quot;dummy&quot; crown by Bowman and asked to promenade in the style of a beauty pageant winner. 

Starting with the August 11, 2019, episode, panelists who earn a perfect score win the &quot;Doris Award,&quot; a gold-colored bust of Bowman. To date, three panelists have won the Doris Award: Oliver Hudson, on September 22, 2019; Deon Cole, on June 25, 2020; and Michael Strahan, on August 6, 2020. (Bowman had to play one round on Strahan&#x27;s behalf, as he knew the central characters.)

==== Panelists ====
The first season featured three regular panelists: Betty White, NeNe Leakes, and Jalen Rose; White has appeared on all three broadcast network versions of the show. In season two, the regular panelists were eliminated.

To maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sixth season reduced the number of panelists from four to three.

Four panelists made ten or more appearances on the show: Sherri Shepherd (eleven), Nikki Glaser (ten), Joel McHale (ten), and Jalen Rose (ten, including six as a season one regular). Former host Alex Trebek was a panelist in a 2018 episode, making him the first host to appear on a subsequent version as a panelist.

==Merchandise==
A board game was released by Lowell in 1957.

During the run of the 2000 version, a single-player online game was offered by the short-lived website Uproar.com, and promoted by host John O&#x27;Hurley at the end of each episode.

A video slot machine game, based on the 1969 version, was released to American casinos nationwide by Bally Gaming Systems in 2002.

<doc id="469796" wikidata="Q1421323" url="?curid=469796" title="Hidden-surface determination">
<text>In 3D computer graphics, hidden-surface determination (also known as shown-surface determination, hidden-surface removal (HSR), occlusion culling (OC) or visible-surface determination (VSD)) is the process of identifying what surfaces and parts of surfaces can be seen from a particular viewing angle. A hidden-surface determination algorithm is a solution to the visibility problem, which was one of the first major problems in the field of 3D computer graphics. The process of hidden-surface determination is sometimes called hiding, and such an algorithm is sometimes called a hider. When referring to line rendering it is known as hidden-line removal. Hidden-surface determination is necessary to render a scene correctly, so that one may not view features hidden behind the model itself, allowing only the naturally viewable portion of the graphic to be visible.

== Background ==
Hidden-surface determination is a process by which surfaces that should not be visible to the user (for example, because they lie behind opaque objects such as walls) are prevented from being rendered. Despite advances in hardware capability, there is still a need for advanced rendering algorithms. The responsibility of a rendering engine is to allow for large world spaces, and as the world’s size approaches infinity, the engine should not slow down but remain at a constant speed. Optimizing this process relies on being able to ensure the deployment of as few resources as possible towards the rendering of surfaces that will not end up being displayed to the user.
There are many techniques for hidden-surface determination. They are fundamentally an exercise in sorting and usually vary in the order in which the sort is performed and how the problem is subdivided. Sorting large quantities of graphics primitives is usually done by divide and conquer.

== Algorithms ==
Considering the rendering pipeline, the projection, the clipping, and the rasterization steps are handled differently by the following algorithms:
; Z-buffering: During rasterization, the depth/Z value of each pixel (or &quot;sample&quot; in the case of anti-aliasing, but without loss of generality the term &quot;pixel&quot; is used) is checked against an existing depth value. If the current pixel is behind the pixel in the Z-buffer, the pixel is rejected, otherwise, it is shaded and its depth value replaces the one in the Z-buffer. Z-buffering supports dynamic scenes easily and is currently implemented efficiently in graphics hardware. This is the current standard. The cost of using Z-buffering is that it uses up to 4 bytes per pixel and that the rasterization algorithm needs to check each rasterized sample against the Z-buffer. The Z-buffer can also suffer from artifacts due to precision errors (also known as Z-fighting).
; Coverage buffers () and surface buffer (S-buffer): Faster than Z-buffers and commonly used in games in the Quake I era. Instead of storing the Z value per pixel, they store a list of already displayed segments per line of the screen. New polygons are then cut against already displayed segments that would hide them. An S-buffer can display unsorted polygons, while a C-buffer requires polygons to be displayed from the nearest to the furthest. Because the C-buffer technique does not require a pixel to be drawn more than once, the process is slightly faster. This was commonly used with binary space partitioning (BSP) trees, which would provide sorting for the polygons.
; Sorted active edge list: Used in Quake 1, this was storing a list of the edges of already displayed polygons (see scanline rendering). Polygons are displayed from the nearest to the furthest. New polygons are clipped against already displayed polygons&#x27; edges, creating new polygons to display then storing the additional edges. It&#x27;s much harder to implement than S/C/Z-buffers, but it scales much better with increases in resolution.
; Painter&#x27;s algorithm: Sorts polygons by their barycenter and draws them back to front. This produces few artifacts when applied to scenes with polygons of similar size forming smooth meshes and back-face culling turned on. The cost here is the sorting step and the fact that visual artifacts can occur. This algorithm is broken by design for general scenes, as it cannot handle polygons in various common configurations, such as surfaces that intersect each other.
; Binary space partitioning (BSP): Divides a scene along planes corresponding to polygon boundaries. The subdivision is constructed in such a way as to provide an unambiguous depth ordering from any point in the scene when the BSP tree is traversed. The disadvantage here is that the BSP tree is created with an expensive pre-process. This means that it is less suitable for scenes consisting of dynamic geometry. The advantage is that the data is pre-sorted and error-free, ready for the previously mentioned algorithms. Note that the BSP is not a solution to HSR, only an aid.
; Ray tracing: Attempts to model the path of light rays to a viewpoint by tracing rays from the viewpoint into the scene. Although not a hidden-surface removal algorithm as such, it implicitly solves the hidden-surface removal problem by finding the nearest surface along each view-ray. Effectively this is equivalent to sorting all the geometry on a per-pixel basis.
; The Warnock algorithm: Divides the screen into smaller areas and sorts triangles within these. If there is ambiguity (i.e., polygons overlap in-depth extent within these areas), then further subdivision occurs. At the limit, the subdivision may occur down to the pixel level.

== Culling and visible-surface determination ==
A related area to visible-surface determination (VSD) is &quot;culling&quot;, which usually happens before VSD in a rendering pipeline. Primitives or batches of primitives can be rejected in their entirety, which &quot;usually&quot; reduces the load on a well-designed system.

The advantage of culling early on in the pipeline is that entire objects that are invisible do not have to be fetched, transformed, rasterized, or shaded. Types of culling algorithms include:

=== Viewing-frustum culling ===
The viewing frustum is a geometric representation of the volume visible to the virtual camera. Naturally, objects outside this volume will not be visible in the final image, so they are discarded. Often, objects lie on the boundary of the viewing frustum. These objects are cut into pieces along this boundary in a process called clipping, and the pieces that lie outside the frustum are discarded as there is no place to draw them.

=== Back-face culling ===
With 3D objects, some of the object&#x27;s surface is facing the camera, and the rest is facing away from the camera, i.e. is on the backside of the object, hindered by the front side. If the object is completely opaque, those surfaces never need to be drawn. They are determined by the vertex winding order: if the triangle drawn has its vertices in clockwise order on the projection plane when facing the camera, they switch into counter-clockwise order when the surface turns away from the camera.

Incidentally, this also makes the objects completely transparent when the viewpoint camera is located inside them, because then all the surfaces of the object are facing away from the camera and are culled by the renderer. To prevent this the object must be set as double-sided (i.e. no back-face culling is done) or have separate inside surfaces.

=== Contribution culling ===
Often, objects are so far away that they do not contribute significantly to the final image. These objects are thrown away if their screen projection is too small. See Clipping plane.

=== Occlusion culling ===

Objects that are entirely behind other opaque objects may be culled. This is a very popular mechanism to speed up the rendering of large scenes that have a moderate to high depth complexity. There are several types of occlusion culling approaches:
* Potentially visible set (&quot;PVS&quot;) rendering divides a scene into regions and pre-computes visibility for them. These visibility sets are then indexed at run-time to obtain high-quality visibility sets (accounting for complex occluder interactions) quickly.
* Portal rendering divides a scene into cells/sectors (rooms) and portals (doors), and computes which sectors are visible by clipping them against portals.

Hansong Zhang&#x27;s dissertation &quot;Effective Occlusion Culling for the Interactive Display of Arbitrary Models&quot; describes an occlusion culling approach.

== Divide and conquer ==
A popular theme in the VSD literature is divide and conquer. The Warnock algorithm pioneered dividing the screen. Beam tracing is a ray-tracing approach that divides the visible volumes into beams. Various screen-space subdivision approaches reducing the number of primitives considered per region, e.g. tiling, or screen-space BSP clipping. Tiling may be used as a preprocess to other techniques. Z-buffer hardware may typically include a coarse &quot;hi-Z&quot;, against which primitives can be rejected early without rasterization, this is a form of occlusion culling.

Bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) are often used to subdivide the scene&#x27;s space (examples are the BSP tree, the octree and the kd-tree). This allows visibility determination to be performed hierarchically: effectively, if a node in the tree is considered to be &quot;invisible&quot;, then all of its child nodes are also invisible, and no further processing is necessary (they can all be rejected by the renderer). If a node is considered &quot;visible&quot;, then each of its children needs to be evaluated. This traversal is effectively a tree walk, where invisibility/occlusion or reaching a leaf node determines whether to stop or whether to recurse respectively.

<doc id="469799" wikidata="Q3491670" url="?curid=469799" title="Land rehabilitation">
<text>Land rehabilitation as a part of environmental remediation is the process of returning the land in a given area to some degree of its former state, after some process (industry, natural disasters, etc.) has resulted in its damage. Many projects and developments will result in the land becoming degraded, for example mining, farming and forestry. It is crucial that governments and businesses act proactively by working on improvement, lay out rehabilitation standards and ensure that decisions on mediation should be based around value judgment for higher sustainability in the future. 

In some jurisdictions, including parts of the United States, the term &quot;reclamation&quot; can refer to land rehabilitation, as in returning disturbed lands to an improved state, instead of the land fill of water bodies. In Alberta, Canada, for example, reclamation is defined by the provincial government as &quot;The process of reconverting disturbed land to its former or other productive uses.&quot;

==Mine rehabilitation==

Modern mine rehabilitation aims to minimize and mitigate the environmental effects of modern mining, which may in the case of open pit mining involve movement of significant volumes of rock. Rehabilitation management is an ongoing process, often resulting in open pit mines being backfilled.

After mining finishes, the mine area must undergo rehabilitation. 
* Waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out, to further stabilize them against erosion.
* If the ore contains sulfides it is usually covered with a layer of clay to prevent access of rain and oxygen from the air, which can oxidize the sulfides to produce sulfuric acid.
* Landfills are covered with topsoil, and vegetation is planted to help consolidate the material.
* Dumps are usually fenced off to prevent livestock denuding them of vegetation.
* The open pit is then surrounded with a fence, to prevent access, and it generally eventually fills up with groundwater.
* Tailings dams are left to evaporate, then covered with waste rock, clay if need be, and soil, which is planted to stabilize it.

For underground mines, rehabilitation is not always a significant problem or cost. This is because of the higher grade of the ore and lower volumes of waste rock and tailings. In some situations, stopes are backfilled with concrete slurry using waste, so that minimal waste is left at surface.

The removal of plant and infrastructure is not always part of a rehabilitation programme, as many old mine plants have cultural heritage and cultural value. Often in gold mines, rehabilitation is performed by scavenger operations which treat the soil within the plant area for spilled gold using modified placer mining gravity collection plants.

Also possible is that the section of the mine that is below ground, is kept and used to provide heating, water and/or methane. Heat extraction can be done using heat exchangers, that convey the heat to a nearby city (hence making it be used for district heating purposes.
Water can be harvested from the mine as well (mines are often filled with water once the mine has been shut down and the pumps no longer operate). Methane is also often present in the mine shafts, in small quantities (often around 0.1%). This can still be recovered though with specialised systems. An added advantage of recovering the methane finally is that the methane does not come into the atmosphere, and so does not contribute to global warming. As research methods continue to expand the focus for future studies should be directed at the correlation that can be observed between biodiversity, mine ecological restoration and carbon sequestration. 

==Mine rehabilitation market==
Depending on the country, mining companies are regulated by federal and state bodies to rehabilitate the affected land and to restore biodiversity offset areas around the mines.

Mine rehabilitation, a legal obligation for mining companies in Australia for which they are required to pay bonds, could be a source of considerable employment generation and economic investment in regional areas, if governments were willing to enforce the laws covering the process.

Before mining activities begin, a rehabilitation security bond must be provided. The Australian mine rehabilitation bonds totals $9.49 billion, with the state of NSW bond totaling $2.68bn in 2019. The size of mining security bonds has been questioned by NSW&#x27;s Auditor General as being insufficient to cover the complete costs associated with mine rehabilitation activities.

In addition to operational mine rehabilitation activities, often termed &#x27;progressive rehabilitation&#x27;, abandoned mines are also restored. The financing for restoring abandoned mines is drawn from operating mines and public sources. The cost of reclaiming the abandoned mines in the US is estimated at $9.6bn.

<doc id="469801" wikidata="Q1156819" url="?curid=469801" title="Spooling">
<text>In computing, spooling is a specialized form of multi-programming for the purpose of copying data between different devices. In contemporary systems, it is usually used for mediating between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a printer. Spooling allows programs to &quot;hand off&quot; work to be done by the peripheral and then proceed to other tasks, or to not begin until input has been transcribed. A dedicated program, the spooler, maintains an orderly sequence of jobs for the peripheral and feeds it data at its own rate. Conversely, for slow &quot;input&quot; peripherals, such as a card reader, a spooler can maintain a sequence of computational jobs waiting for data, starting each job when all of the relevant input is available; see batch processing. The spool itself refers to the sequence of jobs, or the storage area where they are held. In many cases, the spooler is able to drive devices at their full rated speed with minimal impact on other processing.

Spooling is a combination of buffering and queueing.

== Print spooling ==
Nowadays, the most common use of spooling is printing: documents formatted for printing are stored in a queue at the speed of the computer, then retrieved and printed at the speed of the printer. Multiple processes can write documents to the spool without waiting, and can then perform other tasks, while the &quot;spooler&quot; process operates the printer.

For example, when a large organization prepares payroll cheques, the computation takes only a few minutes or even seconds, but the printing process might take hours. If the payroll program printed cheques directly, it would be unable to proceed to other computations until all the cheques were printed. Similarly, before spooling was added to PC operating systems, word processors were unable to do anything else, including interact with the user, while printing.

Spooler or print management software often includes a variety of related features, such as allowing priorities to be assigned to print jobs, notifying users when their documents have been printed, distributing print jobs among several printers, selecting appropriate paper for each document, etc.

A print server applies spooling techniques to allow many computers to share the same printer or group of printers.

=== Banner page ===
Print spoolers can be configured to add a banner page, also called a burst page, job sheet, or printer separator, to the beginning and end of each document and job. These separate documents from each other, identify each document (e.g. with its title) and often also state who printed it (e.g. by username or job name). Banner pages are valuable in office environments where many people share a small number of printers. They are also valuable when a single job can produce multiple documents. Depending on the configuration, banner pages might be generated on each client computer, on a centralized print server, or by the printer itself.

On printers using fanfold continuous forms a leading banner page would often be printed twice, so that one copy would always be face-up when the jobs were separated. The page might include lines printed over the fold, which would be visible along the edge of a stack of printed output, allowing the operator to easily separate the jobs. Some systems would also print a banner page at the end of each job, assuring users that they had collected all of their printout.

== Other applications ==
Spooling is also used to mediate access to punched card readers and punches, magnetic tape drives, and other slow, sequential I/O devices. It allows the application to run at the speed of the CPU while operating peripheral devices at their full rated speed.

A batch processing system uses spooling to maintain a queue of ready-to-run tasks, which can be started as soon as the system has the resources to process them.

Some store and forward messaging systems, such as uucp, used &quot;spool&quot; to refer to their inbound and outbound message queues, and this terminology is still found in the documentation for email and Usenet software.

== History ==
Peripheral devices have always been much slower than core processing units. This was an especially severe problem for early mainframes. For example, a job which read punched cards or generated printed output directly was forced to run at the speed of the slow mechanical devices. The first spooling programs, such as IBM&#x27;s &quot;SPOOL System&quot; (7070-IO-076) copied data from punched cards to magnetic tape, and from tape back to punched cards and printers. Hard disks, which offered faster I/O speeds and support for random access, started to replace the use of magnetic tape for spooling in the middle 1960s, and by the 1970s had largely replaced it altogether.

Because the unit record equipment on IBM mainframes of the early 1960s was slow, it was common for larger systems to use a small offline computer such as an IBM 1401 instead of spooling.

The term &quot;spool&quot; may originate with the Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line (SPOOL) software; this derivation is uncertain, however. &quot;Simultaneous peripheral operations on-line&quot; may be a backronym. Another explanation is that it refers to &quot;spools&quot; or reels of magnetic tape, although “spool” is an uncommon usage.

<doc id="469802" wikidata="Q7782239" url="?curid=469802" title="Anabaptist theology">
<text>Anabaptist theology, also known as Anabaptist doctrine, is a theological tradition reflecting the doctrine of the Anabaptist Churches. The major branches of Anabaptist Christianity (inclusive of Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians) agree on core doctrines but have nuances in practice. While the adherence to doctrine is important in Anabaptist Christianity, living righteously is stressed to a greater degree.

Important sources for Anabaptist doctrine are the Schleitheim Confession and the Dordrecht Confession of Faith, both of which have been held by many Anabaptist Churches throughout history.

Daniel Kauffman, a bishop of the Mennonite Church, codified Anabaptist beliefs in the influential text &quot;Doctrines of the Bible&quot;, which continues to be widely used in catechesis.

John S. Oyer states that the Old Order Amish have an implicit theology that can be found in their biblical hermeneutics, but take little interest in explicit, formal, and systematic theology. It is easier to find out about their implicit theology in talking with them than reading written documents. According to Oyer, their implicit theology is practical, not theoretical. The most important written source of Amish theology, according to Oyer, is &quot;1001 Questions and Answers on the Christian Life&quot;.

The Hutterites possess an account of their belief written by Peter Riedemann (&quot;Rechenschafft unserer Religion, Leer und Glaubens&quot;) and theological tracts and letters by Hans Schlaffer, Leonhard Schiemer and Ambrosius Spittelmaier are extant.

==Overview==
From its inception, Anabaptist practice has sought to emulate early Christianity. A strong theme among Anabaptists has been practical discipleship that turns the believer into a model of righteousness in the here and now. In the 1545 Kempen Confession, the Anabaptist authors stated that, &quot;... we wish nothing but to seek alone the salvation of our souls, and like Christ, seek the well-being of the souls and lives of all people. Today we wish to follow Christ in all righteousness until death.&quot; C. Arnold Snyder writes that:
In the Anabaptist understanding, Jesus Christ perfectly revealed, lived out, and marked the path back to God. Christians are disciples who have committed themselves to following Christ on that path, yielding to God’s will in all things as Jesus did, not claiming possessions for themselves, speaking the truth in all circumstances, humbly giving way in the face of evil power, living non-coercively, willing to suffer rather than inflict suffering on others. The visible ‘shape’ of Anabaptist spirituality is discipleship, the ‘following after Christ’ (&quot;Nachfolge Christi&quot;) in life.&lt;br&gt;
Following after Christ in life will occur in three areas in which humanity is, by its nature, most particularly tempted not to be Christ-like: in the desire to claim ownership of possessions, in the temptation to lie and dissimulate, and in the temptation to coerce by using violence.

==Bible==
Early Anabaptists held a high view of the Bible and insisted on the necessity of it being interpreted with the aid of the living Christ within. Author C. Arnold Snyder describes their view in these words:
In terms of the authority of Scripture, for example, Anabaptists insisted that the Holy Spirit had to be active in the interpretation of the letter. So, for example, a spiritually enlightened peasant would be a more reliable interpreter of Scripture than was a professor of biblical languages who lacked the Spirit. All the same, with the exception of a few prophetic spiritualists, the Anabaptists read and interpreted the text of the Bible itself in a decidedly practical, non-theological way ... The Anabaptists could not agree that political authorities had any right to decide matters of biblical interpretation or decree matters of faith or practice for the church, thus challenging the close church-state relationship that had been taken for granted by the [Protestant] Reformers.

Anabaptists hold that the entire Bible is the word of God, while insisting that the New Testament is the rule of faith and practice for the Church. Anabaptists Hans Denck and Ludwig Hätzer were responsible for the first translation of the Old Testament Prophets from Hebrew into the German language.

The Amish tradition of Anabaptist Christianity uses the Luther Bible, which contains the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament; Amish wedding ceremonies include &quot;the retelling of the marriage of Tobias and Sarah in the Apocrypha&quot;. The texts regarding the martyrdoms under Antiochus IV in the intertestamental section of the Bible (called the Apocrypha) containing 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are held in high esteem by the Anabaptists, who faced persecution in their history.

==Christology==
Christology addresses the person and work of Jesus Christ, relative to his divinity, humanity, and work of salvation. Anabaptist Christology &quot;emphasize[s] the significance of Jesus as our moral example.&quot;

The 16th-century Anabaptists were orthodox Trinitarians accepting both the humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ and salvation through his death on the cross. 

Menno Simons, the father of the Mennonite tradition of Anabaptism, concluded: &quot;In the same manner the heavenly Seed, namely, the Word of God, was sown in Mary, and by her faith, being conceived in her by the Holy Ghost, became flesh, and was nurtured in her body; and thus it is called the fruit of her womb, that same as a natural fruit or offspring is called the fruit of its natural mother.&quot;

==Soteriology==
=== Generalities ===
While Anabaptism has a unique conceptualization of soteriology, its soteriological doctrines share similarities with those of Arminianism in certain respects. In particular, Mennonite soteriology has been historically consistent with Arminianism, whereas the doctrines of Calvinist soteriology have been rejected. Moreover, Anabaptism seems to have influenced Jacobus Arminius. At least, he was “sympathetic to the Anabaptist point of view, and Anabaptists were commonly in attendance on his preaching.”

=== Human&#x27;s condition and calling ===
Some Anabaptists, like Hut and Marpeck, rejected total depravity. Others, shared views akin to Arminians: Hubmaier, Schiemer, and Philips affirmed total depravity and believed in the restoration of human libertarian free will through prevenient grace communicated through the Gospel. Denck and Sattler maintained that God restores human free will through prevenient grace prior to exposure to the Gospel. Schiemer&#x27;s perspective affirmed total depravity and the restoration of free will through prevenient grace given at birth and later experienced at the age of accountability.

=== Conversion ===
Anabaptist doctrine teaches that &quot;True faith entails a new birth, a spiritual regeneration by God&#x27;s grace and power; &#x27;believers&#x27; are those who have become the spiritual children of God.&quot; The Dunkard Brethren Church, a Conservative Anabaptist denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, defines this as follows:
&quot;The beginning of the Anabaptist path to salvation was thus marked not by a forensic understanding of salvation by &#x27;faith alone&#x27;, but by the entire process of repentance, self-denial, faith, rebirth and obedience. It was this process that was marked by the biblical sign of baptism.&quot; After becoming a believer, Anabaptist theology emphasizes &quot;a faith that works.&quot;

Anabaptist denominations teach:

Hans Denck wrote:

Obedience to Jesus and other New Testament teachings, loving one another and being at peace with others, and walking in holiness are seen as &quot;earmarks of the saved.&quot; Good works thus have an important role in the life of an Anabaptist believer, with the teaching &quot;that faith without works is a dead faith&quot; (cf. ) occupying a cornerstone in Anabaptist Christianity. Anabaptists do not teach faith &quot;and&quot; works—in the sense of two separate entities—are necessary for salvation, but rather that true faith will &quot;always&quot; produce good works. Balthasar Hubmaier wrote that &quot;faith by itself alone is not worthy to be called faith, for there can be no true faith without the works of love.&quot;

=== Justification ===
Anabaptists &quot;dismissed the Lutheran doctrine of justification, a dead faith as they called it, which was unable to produce Christian love and good works.&quot; Peter Riedemann wrote:
Rather than a forensic justification that only gave a legal change of one&#x27;s status before God, early Anabaptists taught that &quot;justification begun a dynamic process by which the believer partook of the nature of Christ and was so enabled to live increasingly like Jesus.&quot; Riedemann explained this ontological justification in these words:

=== Preservation ===
Anabaptist theology traditionally teaches conditional security. However, in the 20th century, particularly in North America, some Mennonites, have adopted the doctrine of eternal security.

===Loss of the Holy Spirit===
The majority of Anabaptists historically believed that a person could lose the Holy Spirit through willful sin and disobedience, as maintaining faith required an ongoing commitment to righteousness. However, the Lutheran Book of Concord also references certain Anabaptists who taught that it was impossible for someone who had been justified to lose the Holy Spirit. The Concord condemned this view, asserting that those who have received the Holy Ghost may still fall from grace and depart from the divine favor of God.

==Ecclesiology==
With respect to ecclesiology, Anabaptist theology &quot;calls people to churches, where disciples of Christ strive together to deny the flesh and the world and to pattern themselves into the perfect image of their Master.&quot; The Church is &quot;a vessel charged with delivering souls to the throne of God&quot; and thus provides the faithful with guidelines, such as those concerning modesty.

==Non-resistance==
Most Anabaptist hold that violence is wrong, as is supporting violence though personal actions such as joining the military. This would also include opposition to abortion and capital punishment (cf. consistent life ethic). Conservative Anabaptist denominations, such as the Dunkard Brethren Church, teach:
In 1918, three Hutterite brothers, David, Joseph, and Michael Hofer, and Joseph&#x27;s brother-in-law Jacob Wipf were imprisoned on Alcatraz for refusal to join the US military. Two of them, Joseph and Michael Hofer, died in late 1918 shortly after their transfer to a prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The Bruderhof is another Anabaptist church that is strongly pacifist, believing that personal property is a form of injustice.

According to Harold S. Bender and several of his colleagues, the Anabaptists were &quot;voluntaristic in religious choice, advocates of a church completely free from state influence, biblical literalists, non-participants in any government activity to avoid moral compromise, suffering servant disciples of Jesus who emphasized moral living and who were persecuted and martyred as Jesus had been, and restitutionists who tried to restore pre-Constantinian Christian primitivism&quot;.

Schwertler Anabaptists, such as Balthasar Hubmaier, were not nonresistant and supported the government; they even encouraged involvement in government. In light of this, they were not accepted by the mainstream of the Anabaptists as being true adherents of the faith.

==Forgiveness==
Anabaptist doctrine stresses practicing forgiveness. For example, in instances where drivers of automobiles get into accidents with horse-drawn buggies resulting in the deaths of Old Order Amish people, among other situations, their families forgive the perpetrator. In cases of accidents, Old Order Amish often are contacted by lawyers who encourage them to file lawsuits; the Old Order Amish reject these overtures as being in conflict with their Christian religious beliefs, holding that &quot;We don&#x27;t believe in taking advantage of someone and taking their money&quot;. Reflecting the principles of peace and nonresistance, Anabaptist religious beliefs do not permit the filing of lawsuits (cf. ). Representatives of the Old Order Amish community have said that they &quot;would rather be short on the money&quot; than file a lawsuit.

==Church discipline==

The Anabaptists practiced church discipline before any of the Reformers adopted it. Reformer Martin Bucer was influenced by them to introduce discipline into the church in Strassburg, though the attempt was not successful. Bucer convinced John Calvin of the idea, and he established church discipline in Geneva. Calvin read the Schleitheim Confession in 1544 and concluded, &quot;these unfortunate and ungrateful people have learned this teaching and some other correct views from us.&quot; Calvin was only 18 years old and still a Catholic when the Schleitheim Confession was formed in 1527.

==Modest apparel==

Anabaptist Christianity stresses the importance of modesty, with traditional Anabaptist communities practicing this in the form of plain dress. This practice is a reflection of the Anabaptist doctrine of the nonconformity to the world, which is derived from . The influential Mennonite bishop Daniel Kauffman, who codified the Anabaptist theological text &quot;Manual of Bible Doctrines&quot;, explains that there are two categories of humans: &quot;(1) those that follow the &#x27;lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life&#x27;—the world; (2) those that take Christ as their foundation, and allow their lives to be governed by principles of right—the body of Christ. The simple admonition of our text to those that constitute the body of Christ is, &#x27;Do not allow yourself to become like the world.&#x27;&quot; The transformation spoken of in Romans 12:2, according to Kauffman, involves this concept: &quot;Whenever there is a change of mind, there is a change in all things subject to the mind.&quot; Furthermore, references being &quot;unspotted from the world&quot;, which Daniel Kauffman references to explain the reason behind the wearing of plain dress by adherents of Old Order Anabaptist and Conservative Anabaptist communities: 

Anabaptist Christian denominations that observe the wearing of plain dress, such as the Schwarzenau Brethren Anabaptists, do so because Jesus “condemned anxious thought for raiment” in and . They teach that the wearing of plain dress (without adornment) is scripturally commanded in , , and , in addition to being taught by the early Church Fathers. Indeed, in the early Christian manual Paedagogus, the injunction for clothing to extend past the knees was enjoined. With the adjective &quot;kosmios&quot; (κόσμιος) meaning &quot;modest&quot;, uses the Greek word catastola &quot;katastolé&quot; (καταστολῇ) for the &quot;apparel&quot; suitable for Christian females, and for this reason, women belonging to Conservative Anabaptist denominations often wear a cape dress with a headcovering; for example, ladies who are members of the Charity Christian Fellowship wear the cape dress with an opaque hanging veil as the denomination teaches that &quot;the sisters are to wear a double layered garment as the Greek word &#x27;catastola&#x27; describes.&quot;

==Ordinances==
The Anabaptist view of the ordinances is generally one of being a remembrance, or a exterior sign/symbol of inward spiritual realities. This view can be summed up with the following statement taken from the 1577 Waterlander Confession. Even though this was written concerning the Lord&#x27;s Supper, the concept applies to the other ordinances:
We confess concerning the Supper of the Lord, that it is a sign of divine grace, a seal of the eternal covenant of God, a visible ordinance or ceremony, instituted by Jesus Christ in the congregation of God. It was instituted with bread and wine, the bread broken in remembrance of the death of Christ, the wine received in remembrance of the pouring out of his blood. In receiving it, believing Christian members search themselves to find the true essence to which the Lord’s Supper does point.
These exterior ordinances, when practiced in conjunction with the inward realities, &quot;brought one into conformity with the truth of Jesus Christ, whose life, crucifixion, death, and resurrection had so fundamentally altered all of humanity and creation that human beings were now capable of works of loving obedience that revealed the indwelling presence of God in Christ in all people.&quot; 

In Anabaptist churches of the Conservative Mennonite tradition, seven ordinances are taught, including &quot;baptism, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, footwashing, marriage, anointing with oil, the holy kiss, and the veiling of women.&quot; 

Within the Anabaptist churches of the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition and the River Brethren tradition, the Lovefeast is observed, which includes the ordinances of the holy kiss, footwashing and communion, in addition to the sharing of a communal meal.

===Baptism===

The Anabaptist view of baptism is one of its outstanding features. In their view, baptism was reserved for repentant believers who were aware that their sins had been forgiven, not unknowing infants. In this view they defied both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Reformers. In addition, Anabaptists rejected all Roman Catholic and Magisterial Protestant (Lutheran, Anglican and Reformed) baptism as invalid. They therefore re-baptized those whom they regarded as not having received any Christian initiation at all, and claimed that their baptism after profession of faith was the recipient&#x27;s first legitimate baptism. Reportedly, one of the first adult baptisms of the Reformation was publicly performed in Zürich, Switzerland, in January 1525. According to the Schleitheim Confession (1527): 
Baptism shall be given to all those who have learned repentance and amendment of life, and who believe truly that their sins are taken away by Christ, and to all those who walk in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and wish to be buried with Him in death, so that they may be resurrected with Him and to all those who with this significance request it (baptism) of us and demand it for themselves. This excludes all infant baptism, the highest and chief abomination of the Pope. In this you have the foundation and testimony of the apostles. Matt. 28, Mark 16, Acts 2, 8, 16, 19.

The Dordrecht Confession (1632) states, 
Concerning baptism we confess that all penitent believers, who, through faith, regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, are made one with God, and are written in heaven, must, upon such Scriptural confession of faith, and renewing of life, be baptized with water, in the most worthy name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, according to the command of Christ, and the teaching, example, and practice of the apostles, to the burying of their sins, and thus be incorporated into the communion of the saints; henceforth to learn to observe all things which the Son of God has taught, left, and commanded His disciples.

The concept of believers&#x27; baptism drew the main attention of 16th-century Continental Anabaptists, but the mode was also an issue. The majority appear to have taught and practiced baptism by pouring, while a minority practiced baptism by immersion. The writings of Menno Simons seem at times to promote immersion as the proper mode, but his practice was by pouring. Bernhard Rothmann argued for immersion in his &quot;Bekentnisse&quot;, and Pilgram Marpeck copied this idea into his &quot;Vermanung&quot;, but weakened the position by accepting pouring or sprinkling as an alternate mode. The mode of baptism was debated by the Hutterites and the Polish Brethren around the turn of the 17th century, and the arguments for immersion by Polish leader Christoph Ostorodt were incorporated into the &quot;Racovian Confession of Faith&quot; in 1604. Servetus made a strong case for immersion. The Mennonites, Swiss Brethren, South German Anabaptists, and Hutterites were not as concerned about mode, and, while not rejecting immersion, found pouring much more practical and believed it to be the Scriptural mode. As such, Anabaptist denominations such as the Mennonites, Amish and Hutterites use pouring as the mode to administer believer&#x27;s baptism, whereas Anabaptists of the Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christian traditions baptize by immersion. 
In the practice of the Apostolic Christian Church, after a seeker receives believer&#x27;s baptism:
===Holy Kiss===
Anabaptists greet one another with a holy kiss (especially during the Lovefeast), in obedience to the injunctions in the New Testament in , , , , and . This Apostolic ordinance was enjoined by the early Church Fathers, such as Tertullian who wrote that before leaving a house, Christians are to give the Holy Kiss and say &quot;peace to this house&quot;; the Holy Kiss was exchanged during worship as well. Mennonite theologian and bishop Daniel Kauffman taught that the Anabaptist ordinance of the Holy Kiss was emphasized five times in the Bible by the Apostles, who &quot;aimed to teach their followers the way to attain to the highest degree of Christian perfection, and hence felt called upon to teach every thing that tended to accomplish this result.&quot;

===Footwashing===
Many Anabaptist communities, with the Hutterites being a notable exception, practice footwashing in obedience of Jesus&#x27; command in for those who follow him &quot;to wash one another&#x27;s feet&quot;. After the death of the apostles or the end of the Apostolic Age, the practice was continued.

Mennonite theologian J. C. Wenger stated that “There is no exegetical consideration against the observance of feet washing, for example, which would not also bear against the observance of baptism.”

===Lord&#x27;s Supper===

In the early Anabaptist Schleitheim Confession, &quot;breaking of bread&quot; is the term used for the Lord&#x27;s supper, also known as communion or eucharist. The Anabaptist view of the Lord&#x27;s supper is similar to the &quot;Zwinglian&quot; or &quot;symbolism&quot; view. The corporate nature (fellowship, unity) of participation is emphasized to a greater degree than in many communions. Pilgram Marpeck wrote, &quot;As members of one body, we proclaim the death of Christ and bodily union attained by untainted brotherly love.&quot; The terminology sacrament is generally rejected. Marpeck further wrote, &quot;The true meaning of communion is mystified and obscured by the word sacrament.&quot; In connection with the Lord&#x27;s supper, many Anabaptists stress the rite of feet washing. Anabaptists locate the presence of Jesus not in the eucharistic elements themselves, but teach that the &quot;mystery of communion with the living Christ in his Supper comes into being by the power of the Spirit, dwelling in and working through the collected members of Christ&#x27;s Body&quot;. As such, in celebrations of Holy Communion, &quot;Anabaptist congregations looked to the living Christ in their hearts and in their midst, who transformed members and elements together into a mysterious communion, creating his Body in many members, ground like grains and crushed like grapes, into one bread and one drink.&quot;

===Marriage===
Both the Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers shape Anabaptist theology on the permanence of marriage. Mennonite bishop and theologian Daniel Kauffman wrote in &quot;Doctrines of the Bible&quot; that &quot;The ordinance [of marriage] is for the maintenance and purity of the human family (Mark 10:2-12). The teaching in the &quot;Church Polity&quot; of the Dunkard Brethren Church, a Conservative Anabaptist denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, is reflective of Anabaptist theology regarding marriage:

Anabaptist denominations, such as the Mennonite Christian Fellowship, teach the &quot;sinfulness of remarriage following divorce&quot;. The Biblical Mennonite Alliance holds that divorced and remarried persons are living in adultery and are therefore in &quot;an ongoing state of sin that can only be truly forgiven when divorced and remarried persons separate.&quot;

===Headcovering for women===
Anabaptist Christianity traditionally calls for the wearing of a headcovering by women in obedience to . A Conservative Anabaptist publication titled &quot;The Significance of the Christian Woman&#x27;s Veiling&quot;, authored by Merle Ruth, teaches with regard to the continual wearing of the headcovering by believing women, that it is:

Anabaptist expositor Daniel Willis, cites the Early Church Father John Chrysostom&#x27;s explication of Saint Paul&#x27;s teaching in 1 Corinthians 11 as the basis for continual headcovering (during worship and in public) among women, particularly Saint Paul&#x27;s assertions regarding the angels and that women being unveiled is dishonourable so by consequence, Christian women should cover their heads with a veil continually:
===Anointing with oil===
Anabaptists observe the ordinance of anointing of the sick in obedience to . In a compendium of Anabaptist doctrine, Daniel Kauffman stated:
The &quot;Church Polity&quot; of the Dunkard Brethren Church, a Conservative Anabaptist denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, teaches:
==Lord&#x27;s Day==

Anabaptists hold that the Lord&#x27;s Day should be commemorated through the attendance of church services, along with works of mercy such as &quot;witnessing for God in one of many ways, visiting someone who is sick or discouraged, widows, orphans, or older people, spending time with the family, studying some subject of interest in the Bible that some are wondering about, reading upbuilding literature, etc.&quot; In the view of Anabaptist Christianity, &quot;worldly entertainment that would draw our minds away from Christ would be a poor way to commemorate His resurrection&quot;. &quot;The Statement of Faith and Practice&quot; of Salem Amish Mennonite Church, a Conservative Mennonite congregation in the Beachy Amish Mennonite tradition, is reflective of traditional Anabaptist teaching on the Lord&#x27;s Day:

The &quot;Church Polity&quot; of the Dunkard Brethren Church, a Conservative Anabaptist denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, teaches that &quot;The First Day of the week is the Christian Sabbath and is to be kept as a day of rest and worship. (Matt. 28:1; Acts 20:7; John 20:1; Mark 16:2)&quot;

<doc id="469806" wikidata="Q1516464" url="?curid=469806" title="Treasury stock">
<text>A treasury stock or reacquired stock is stock which is bought back by the issuing company, reducing the amount of outstanding stock on the open market (&quot;open market&quot; including insiders&#x27; holdings). 

Stock repurchases are used as a tax efficient method to put cash into shareholders&#x27; hands, rather than paying dividends, in jurisdictions that treat capital gains more favorably. Sometimes, companies repurchase their stock when they feel that it is undervalued on the open market. Other times, companies repurchase their stock to reduce dilution from incentive compensation plans for employees. Another reason for stock repurchase is to protect the company against a takeover threat.

The United Kingdom equivalent of treasury stock as used in the United States is treasury share. Treasury stocks in the UK refers to government bonds or gilts.

==Limitations of treasury stock==

*Treasury stock is not entitled to receive a dividend
*Treasury stock has no voting rights
*Total treasury stock can not exceed the maximum proportion of total capitalization specified by law in the relevant country

When shares are repurchased, they may either be canceled or held for reissue. If not canceled, such shares are referred to as treasury shares. Technically, a repurchased share is a company&#x27;s own share that has been bought back after having been issued and fully paid.

The possession of treasury shares does not give the company the right to vote, to exercise preemptive rights as a shareholder, to receive cash dividends, or to receive assets on company liquidation. Treasury shares are essentially the same as unissued capital, which is not classified as an asset on the balance sheet, as an asset should have probable future economic benefits. Treasury shares simply reduce ordinary share capital.

==Buying back shares==

===Benefits===
In an efficient market, a company buying back its stock should have no effect on its price per share valuation. If the market fairly prices a company&#x27;s shares at $50/share, and the company buys back 100 shares for $5,000, it now has $5,000 less cash but there are 100 fewer shares outstanding; the net effect should be that the underlying value of each share is unchanged. Additionally, buying back shares will improve price/earnings ratios due to the reduced number of shares (and unchanged earnings) and improve earnings per share ratios due to fewer shares outstanding (and unchanged earnings).

If the market is not efficient, the company&#x27;s shares may be underpriced. In that case a company can benefit its other shareholders by buying back shares. If a company&#x27;s shares are overpriced, then a company is actually hurting its remaining shareholders by buying back stock.

===Incentives===
One other reason for a company to buy back its own stock is to reward holders of stock options. Call option holders are hurt by dividend payments, since, typically, they are not eligible to receive them. A share buyback program &quot;may&quot; increase the value of remaining shares (if the buyback is executed when shares are under-priced); if so, call option holders benefit. A dividend payment short term &quot;always&quot; decreases the value of shares after the payment, so, for stocks with regularly scheduled dividends, on the day shares go ex-dividend, call option holders &quot;always&quot; lose whereas put option holders benefit. This does not apply to unscheduled (special) dividends since the strike prices of options are typically adjusted to reflect the amount of the special dividend. Finally, if the sellers into a corporate buyback are actually the call option holders themselves, they may directly benefit from temporary unrealistically favorable pricing.

===After buyback===
The company can either retire (cancel) the shares (however, retired shares are not listed as treasury stock on the company&#x27;s financial statements) or hold the shares for later resale. Buying back stock reduces the number of outstanding shares. Accompanying the decrease in the number of shares outstanding is a reduction in company assets, in particular, cash assets, which are used to buy back shares.

==Accounting for treasury stock==
On the balance sheet, treasury stock is listed under shareholders&#x27; equity as a negative number. It is commonly called &quot;treasury stock&quot; or &quot;equity reduction&quot;. That is, treasury stock is a contra account to shareholders&#x27; equity.

One way of accounting for treasury stock is with the cost method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the treasury stock is bought. When the treasury stock is sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.

Another common way for accounting for treasury stock is the par value method. In the par value method, when the stock is purchased back from the market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common stock is debited and treasury stock is credited. However, when the treasury stock is resold back to the market the entry in the books will be the same as the cost method.

In either method, any transaction involving treasury stock cannot increase the amount of retained earnings. If the treasury stock is sold for more than cost, then the paid-in capital treasury stock is the account that is increased, not retained earnings. In auditing financial statements, it is a common practice to check for this error to detect possible attempts to &quot;cook the books&quot;.

==United States regulations==
In the United States, buybacks are covered by multiple laws under the auspices of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

==United Kingdom regulations==
In the UK, the Companies Act 1955 disallowed companies from holding their own shares. However, the Companies Act 1985 later repealed this.

<text>QuikAir (QuikAir Airline Service) was a small Canadian regional airline based in Calgary, Alberta, serving business travellers. QuikAir ceased its operations on October 24, 2006.

== Code data ==
*IATA Code: Q9 

== Services ==
QuikAir was launched in 2001, operating over 25,000 flights between Calgary and Edmonton until its closure in 2006. The airline operated four aircraft dedicated to providing 24 daily flights between Calgary and Edmonton, while also operating flights to Fort McMurray and Penticton, British Columbia. Until 2004, it also operated in Quebec and Ontario. Private charters were also available.

== Fleet ==
As of August 2006, the QuikAir fleet included:

*2 BAe Jetstream 31
*2 BAe Jetstream 32

== Failure ==

The demise of QuikAir was caused by several different factors:

The scheduled service into Edmonton was restricted to the International Airport only, under the Access Agreement which prevented scheduled flights from serving the City Center Airport. The International Airport, being located in Leduc and not actually Edmonton (18 km from Edmonton, 36 km from Edmonton&#x27;s downtown), forced many regular business travellers to find other transportation into the downtown core.

The proposed scheduled service into Penticton was met with resistance by means of a Transport Canada representative. Unsatisfied with the Jetstream&#x27;s single engine performance, it was decided that, in the event of an engine failure, the aircraft could not make it safely back out of the valley in which Penticton lies. Multiple revisions of approach procedures occurred, each which had to be reviewed and approved.

As the Penticton route debuted with much fanfare, many flights were pre-sold to customers. Not wanting to lose their customer base, QuikAir chartered several different airlines to carry their passengers for the scheduled flights while the approach procedures were being worked out. Often there were communication problems between QuikAir, these contracted airlines, and the passengers, which led to customer dissatisfaction.

QuikAir ceased operations as of October 24, 2006, leaving many passengers making new arrangements and fighting for their refunds, and several employees without their last weeks of wages. Bankruptcy was declared November 16, 2007.

The Calgary-Edmonton corridor routes were picked up by Peace Air, which also ran scheduled flights to Fort McMurray.
(Peace Air has since ceased operations as of May 18, 2007.)

<text>Hardcore is a 1979 American neo-noir crime drama film written and directed by Paul Schrader, and starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Dick Sargent. The plot follows a conservative Midwestern businessman whose teenage daughter goes missing in California. With the help of a prostitute, his search leads him into the illicit subculture of pornography, including snuff films.

Schrader, who had previously written the screenplay for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), began developing &quot;Hardcore&quot; with executive producer John Milius the same year for Warner Bros. After Warner bought out Schrader&#x27;s contract and took control of the project, Warren Beatty became attached as the star and producer. However, creative clashes between Beatty and Schrader led to Beatty&#x27;s departure from the production. Following this, Scott was cast in the lead role. The film was shot on location in several California cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco, as well as in Schrader&#x27;s hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

&quot;Hardcore&quot; was released in February 1979 by Columbia Pictures. It was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival. Upon its initial release, the film received somewhat mixed reviews, but retrospective assessments have been more positive.

==Plot==

In December 1977, Jake Van Dorn (George C. Scott), a devout Calvinist businessman and single father from Grand Rapids, Michigan, faces a parent&#x27;s worst nightmare when his teenage daughter, Kristen, vanishes during a church-sponsored trip to Bellflower, California. Months pass with no leads until May 1978, when Andy Mast (Peter Boyle), a brash private investigator from Los Angeles, presents Van Dorn with shocking evidence: an 8 mm stag film purchased in an L.A. sex shop, depicting Kristen engaged in a sexual act with two men. Horrified, Van Dorn becomes convinced his daughter has been kidnapped and forced into sex work. 

Flying to Los Angeles, Van Dorn confronts Mast, only to find him distracted by a porn star he was meant to investigate. Disgusted, Van Dorn fires him and takes matters into his own hands. He plunges into the city&#x27;s seedy underbelly, visiting peep shows, brothels, and adult stores, but his rigid morals clash with the exploitative world he encounters. Frustrated by the LAPD&#x27;s indifference, he poses as a pornography producer, placing an ad in the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; to lure potential informants. 

Respondents flood his motel room, including &quot;Jism Jim,&quot; a disheveled actor from the stag film. After a violent interrogation, Jim directs Van Dorn to Niki (Season Hubley), a streetwise prostitute who claims to know Kristen&#x27;s whereabouts. Though wary, Van Dorn pays Niki to guide him through California&#x27;s porn circuit. Unbeknownst to him, his brother-in-law Wes rehires Mast, who tails the pair as their search intensifies.

Their uneasy partnership leads them from Los Angeles to San Diego and eventually San Francisco, with Van Dorn and Niki slowly bridging their ideological divide. Niki, accustomed to being objectified, finds unexpected respect in Van Dorn&#x27;s company, while he confides in her about his failed marriage and emotional detachment as a father. Their discussions reveal stark contrasts in their views on religion and sexuality, yet mutual dependence grows.

In San Francisco, Niki connects Van Dorn to Tod, a dealer linked to Ratan, a sadistic sadomasochistic pornographer rumored to produce snuff films. In a dimly lit sex shop, Van Dorn endures a screening of Ratan&#x27;s latest film—a gruesome murder of a Mexican sex worker in Tijuana—relieved yet traumatized to see the victim isn&#x27;t Kristen. 

Pressure mounts as Van Dorn demands Tod&#x27;s address from Niki, who fears abandonment once Kristen is found. A heated confrontation culminates in Van Dorn striking her, forcing her compliance. Tracking Tod to a bondage dungeon, Van Dorn brutalizes him into revealing Ratan&#x27;s hideout: a nightclub hosting live sex shows. There, Van Dorn and Mast discover Kristen performing onstage under Ratan&#x27;s control. 

Chaos erupts as Van Dorn confronts Ratan, who slashes him with a knife before Mast fatally shoots him. In the aftermath, Van Dorn finds Kristen cowering in the club&#x27;s basement. To his devastation, she reveals she fled voluntarily, rejecting his stifling upbringing for a world where she felt &quot;seen.&quot; Tearfully, Van Dorn admits his emotional failings, rooted in his austere faith, and pleads for reconciliation. Reluctantly, Kristen agrees to return home. 

As they depart, Van Dorn spots Niki in the crowd. He attempts a hollow gesture of gratitude, but both understand their bond is severed. Niki disappears into the shadows, resigned to her bleak reality, while Van Dorn and Kristen retreat to Grand Rapids—their futures uncertain, their wounds far deeper than flesh.

==Cast==
== Production ==

===Development===
Paul Schrader partly based the screenplay for &quot;Hardcore&quot; on his own experience growing up in the Calvinist church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he studied theology at Calvin College. Having recently written the screenplay for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), Schrader began preparing &quot;Hardcore&quot; alongside executive producer John Milius at Warner Bros. After a shift in the studio&#x27;s management, Schrader was paid a sum of $500,000 to terminate his contract, after which Warren Beatty was attached as both the star and producer.

Milius later commented on the project, stating it was &quot;a wonderful script that turned out to be a lousy movie. I blame Paul&#x27;s direction for that.&quot; In the original version of the screenplay, the film ended with Jake never locating his daughter, and later learning of her death in a car accident.

===Casting===
Beatty clashed with Schrader in the pre-production stages of the film, resulting in Beatty leaving the project in August 1976. Beatty had wanted Schrader to reshape the script so that his character was searching for his missing girlfriend rather than his daughter, as Beatty felt he was too young at the time to portray the father of a teenager. According to director Schrader, &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t take me as a director... No good. I held out. I turned down a very large sum of money. I went after [George C.] Scott and I got him. One of the greatest actors in the world.&quot;

Schrader originally cast Diana Scarwid in the role of Niki, but the studio rejected her for the role, deeming her not attractive enough, after which Season Hubley was cast. Real-life adult film actress Marilyn Chambers also auditioned for the role, but was turned down by a casting director who thought she did not fit the image of a porn star. Years later, Chambers said &quot;The &quot;Hardcore&quot; people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels. That&#x27;s such a cliche.&quot;

Ilah Davis, a first-time actress, was cast as Kristen Van Dorn as Schrader felt &quot;she was not conventionally beautiful, and was the sort of person who could be lured by flattery,&quot; mirroring her character&#x27;s story. &quot;Hardcore&quot; was her role in a motion picture. At the time, she was working an exotic dancer in New York City while a member of the Yippies, and later joined the Rainbow Family in under the married name &#x27;Ilah Rogers&#x27;.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Hardcore&quot; took place on February 6, 1978 largely in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, with additional photography occurring in Schrader&#x27;s hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan, where part of the film is set. Schrader featured his own childhood church and a factory where he was employed as filming locations, and also cast his parents in uncredited bit parts. By Schrader&#x27;s account, the shoot in Grand Rapids was unpleasant, as locals expressed disapproval for the film and its depiction of the community as highly provincial and socially antiquated.

By Schrader&#x27;s account, Scott was in low spirits while shooting the film, which Schrader attributed to his recent commercial failures directing &quot;Rage&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Savage Is Loose&quot; (1974). &quot;George, at this time, was not a terribly happy man,&quot; said Schrader. In his contract, Scott stipulated that the production include five break days for the actor due to his drinking problem at the time. Scott and Schrader often clashed on set, with Scott once proclaiming that, while a great writer, Schrader was a terrible director and that the film &quot;was a piece of shit.&quot;

==Release==
===Critical response===
Despite arguing that the climax lapses into action film cliches, Roger Ebert nonetheless gave the movie a four-out-of-four-star review for its &quot;moments of pure revelation&quot;, particularly in the scenes between Scott and Hubley. Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;both a rich film of ideas and of strikingly real characters&quot;. He thought George C. Scott gave &quot;one of his finest performances&quot; in the film. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a very good film&quot; and predicted that no matter what each individual audience member&#x27;s attitudes toward pornography and religion were, &quot;nobody&#x27;s going to be bored&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a mixed review that Schrader &quot;demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity to the realities of the American heritage that are seldom even thought about on screen, much less dramatized. His characters are complex. Unfortunately the melodrama seldom matches their complexity. It is blunt, clumsy—melodrama that seems not to reflect life but the ways lives are led in the movies.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative, explaining that &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; worked because &quot;the protagonist, Travis Bickle, had a fear and hatred of sex so feverishly sensual that we experienced his tensions, his explosiveness. But in &quot;Hardcore&quot;, Jake feels no lust, so there&#x27;s no enticement—and no contest. The Dutch Reformation Church has won the battle for his soul before the film&#x27;s first frame.&quot; She added, &quot;there something a little batty about the way Jake strides through hell swinging his fists, like a Calvinist John Wayne.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;strong but finally disappointing stuff&quot;, explaining, &quot;Quite apart from the plot concoctions that leave reality so far behind, the exasperation of &quot;Hardcore&quot; is that the confrontation has never quite come off. The daughter, whose feelings are presumably crucial to an understanding of the story, is never more than a cipher and a symbol.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;absorbing but unsatisfying&quot;, finding that the reconciliation at the end &quot;violates too much of what we&#x27;ve been led to believe&quot;.

The film was condemned by the United States Catholic Conference for its profanity, nudity, and depiction of Christianity.

On &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Director Paul Schrader&#x27;s preoccupations with alienation and faith are given a compelling avatar in George C. Scott&#x27;s superb performance, although some audiences may find &quot;Hardcore&quot; too soft to live up to its provocative promise.&quot;

<doc id="469815" wikidata="Q7551536" url="?curid=469815" title="Modern Times (community)">
<text>Modern Times was a Utopian community existing from 1851 to 1864 in what is now Brentwood, New York, United States. Founded by Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews, the community based its structure on Warren’s ideas of individual sovereignty and equitable commerce. Modern Times existed until 1864 when its citizens decided to change the name of the town to Brentwood. Writers have cited different reasons for the community’s failure.

==Background==
Warren had been a successful inventor and industrialist before he became interested in the idea of utopian communities. He was fascinated with New Harmony, Indiana, which Robert Owen had founded in 1825 as a socialist community. In 1825, Warren sold his factory and took his family to live in New Harmony which then failed within two years. Warren felt that the reasons for its failure were the authoritarian nature of the community and the socialist idea of holding all property in common. From this experience, he came up with the idea of individual sovereignty which can be expressed as &quot;the moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity and be the exclusive controller of one&#x27;s own body and life&quot;.

Warren also realized that individual sovereignty must extend to economic matters and that owning property in common had been detrimental to New Harmony. He also developed the idea &quot;cost the limit of price&quot;. He believed that goods and services should be traded according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to what individuals subjectively believed them to be worth. Therefore, he proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could either exchange the notes at the local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce, or they could exchange their labor notes with other residents for an equivalent amount of labor.

==History==
===Establishment===
Steven Pearl Andrews met Josiah Warren in 1851 in New York City. Andrews was a lawyer and an abolitionist. He had varied interests that included American Shorthand and being conversant with over 30 languages. Andrews was so fascinated by Warren’s ideas that he wrote a book about them in order to give them a wider audience. In 1851, they decided to start their experimental village of Modern Times located in what is now Brentwood. Warren and Andrews sold the land at cost to the new settlers with the stipulation that the buyers had to wait at least five years before they could sell the land at a market price. Sales before that time had to be at cost.

===Life at Modern Times===
William Metcalf was the first person to put a home up in spring 1851. In the next year, ten more families moved in. The ability to swap labor notes for other people&#x27;s labor and Josiah Warren&#x27;s cost-saving method of making bricks out of sundried mortar ensured that the home prices would be affordable. By 1855, the New York State census reported 85 people living in Modern Times. In 1860, the federal census listed 126 residents.

While Modern Times, in theory, was designed to operate as a self-sufficient labor-for-labor exchange, in reality the residents soon had to go out to work in the outside world in order to procure money to purchase a good deal of the things that were needed to live.

Modern Times became a town with no government, laws or police, and which could be referred to as anarchistic, yet there was no crime or violence during its 13 year history.

===Decline and renaming===
Different reasons are posited for the inability of Modern Times to continue beyond its 14-year life span. Vern Dyson wrote that &quot;the economic panic of 1857 undermined the business enterprises of the village and the civil war completed the task of annihilation&quot;. William Bailie also stated his opinion about the deleterious effects of the panic of 1857 on Modern Times. Roger Wunderlich felt that Bailie exaggerated the impact of the 1857 crash on Modern Times and wrote that after the crash a slow but steady influx of settlers continued. Wunderlich further says that, even before 1857, more of the skilled workers of Modern Times &quot;were beginning to be disinclined to trade their skills at par without financial gain&quot;, and so worked outside Modern Times. Charles Codman, who was a resident of Modern Times, wrote many years later that the lack of a charismatic leader who was able to spread the ideas about Modern Times to a wider audience and the fact that a good deal of the settlers were not dedicated to the ideals of equitable commerce, led to its inability to continue as a utopian village.

Finally, Wunderlich wrote that the Civil War presented the residents of Modern Times with a situation and choices that were contrary to their personal beliefs. Could one be believer in individual sovereignty and join the army to fight or pay taxes for the war effort? In the end, out of the 168 men from Islip town who enlisted in the Union Army, 15 of them were from Modern Times. Modern Times had sent a higher proportion of its men to war than did the Town of Islip as a whole.

In 1864, the members of Modern Times decided to change the name of their town to Brentwood in order to cut down on the amount of unfavorable publicity that the name of Modern Times had created.

<text>Mursko Središće (, Kajkavian: &quot;Mursko Središče&quot;) is the northernmost town in Croatia, located at (alt. 175 m) and one of the oldest localities in Međimurje County.

Mursko Središće has a total population of 6,307, and an area of . It lies on the river Mura, the natural line dividing Croatia from Slovenia.

Nearby places are Čakovec, Sveti Martin na Muri, Lendava, and Podturen.

==History==

Mursko Središće is first mentioned in 1334 as &quot;Sancti Martini in Zredysche&quot;. Historian Ivan Kukuljević-Sakcinski claimed that the site was occupied by the Romans and was known under the name of &quot;Helicanum&quot;. If true, it would have been a strategic point on the road between Ptuj (Poetovio) in Slovenia and Carnuntum (Petronell) on the river Danube, the post between today&#x27;s Vienna and Bratislava in Slovakia. The existing road was built in the 1st century. Other historians disagree, claiming that Helicanum might be today&#x27;s Sveti Martin na Muri or nearby Lendava (Lendva).

The town&#x27;s residents have always been connected to their river. Since the 4th century BC, there have been reports of floating mills powered by the river&#x27;s stream. The ancient know-how was later accepted by Slavs, then by Magyars upon their arrival. Several decades ago, many of them were scattered along the river banks. The last one in the town was still operating in the 1970s.

In 1477, Mursko Središće was officially mentioned as an important trade post with three other places in Međimurje (Čakovec, Prelog and Nedelišće). In 1650, the town was known as &quot;Muraszerdahely&quot; and in 1660 the local chapel of &quot;St. Martin&quot; was documented. In 1716 the church, that of &quot;St. Ladislaus&quot;, was built in the gothic style, but was ruined by the flood in 1690. It was then rebuilt in late baroque style.

The town was the seat of Muraszerdahely District of the former Zala County.

The building of a railroad between Lendava and Čakovec in 1889 facilitated communication, and the first bridge crossing the Mura river was built for the railroad in 1889.

With the beginning of the 20th century, development was faster thanks to the discovery of crude oil in nearby Selnica and Peklenica in 1856. At the time, oil was treated and used differently, with total production of 6900 t in 1918. In 1901, even for that level of extraction a pipeline was constructed between Mursko Središće and nearby Selnica, the first one in this part of Europe.

In late 1918, Mursko Središće was added to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the rest of Međimurje. During the World War II, between 1941 and 1945, it was occupied by Hungary.

After World War I, coal was discovered in 1921, and the exploitation of this source of energy began soon after. The first coal mine was opened in 1926, with qualified and experienced workers brought from Slovenia. (There were other points of extraction in Peklenica (even earlier) and Lopatinec. World War II ended the business started by &quot;Kraljić &amp; Majhen Co.&quot;, which was then nationalized and managed under the name of &quot;Međimurski ugljenokopi&quot;. In that period (1946–1972), coal extraction was significant, with total output of 4,593,961 t, in average 155,000 t each year. Low prices of gasoline made the coal extraction industry unprofitable and forced it to be closed despite significant reserves.

The second bridge over the Mura, used in road transportation, was built in 1968.

==Population==

The town&#x27;s administrative area consists of the following settlements:
* Hlapičina, population 676
* Križovec, population 631
* Mursko Središće, population 3,444
* Peklenica, population 1,217
* Štrukovec, population 339

==People and activities==

The local elementary school has about 500 pupils. Since the whole area was for centuries influenced by or was part of Hungary, part of its history and culture are still evident today in language, diet, customs, and music.

Forms of organized activities are numerous, such as tennis, basketball, association football, chess, hunting and fishing, and the radio &quot;9A1CMS&quot; club.

There are two singing choirs, one of them adding literary, drama, music tamburitza music and folklore sections, the last run by Franjo Liklin for decades. Portions of the work by renowned ethnomusicologist Vinko Žganec was done here since he was the native of neighboring Vratišinec.

==Today==

Today, Mursko Središće is the local administrative, business and trade center with industry primarily in the textile, transportation, building materials and more and more tourism. There are numerous places to stay within the town or in proximity to it.

<doc id="469826" wikidata="Q366734" url="?curid=469826" title="Tokugawa Ienobu">
<text>(11 June 1662 – 12 November 1712) was the sixth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty of Japan. He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Tsunashige, thus making him the nephew of Tokugawa Ietsuna and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, the grandson of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the great-grandson of Tokugawa Hidetada, and the great-great-grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. All of Ienobu&#x27;s children died young.

==Early life (1662–1694)==
Tokugawa Ienobu was born as the oldest son of Tokugawa Tsunashige, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu, in 1662. His mother was a concubine. Tsunashige was the middle brother of Tokugawa Ietsuna and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi and the second son of Tokugawa Iemitsu with his concubine, thus making Ienobu their nephew. In 1662, Ienobu&#x27;s uncle, Ietsuna was &quot;shōgun&quot;, and his father, Tsunashige, was &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu, a very valuable piece of land to the Tokugawa. Before becoming &quot;shōgun&quot; his name was Tokugawa Tsunatoyo, the 4th &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu Domain from the Tokugawa clan. His childhood name was Toramatsu (虎松).

Not much is known of Ienobu&#x27;s early life except that he was expected to become the next &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kofu after the death of his father. However, after Tokugawa Ietsuna had died in 1680, and his other uncle, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi succeeded the &quot;bakufu&quot;, Tsunayoshi&#x27;s failure to produce a male heir greatly increased the chances of Ienobu becoming shogun. Nonetheless, for the time being, Ienobu was not being groomed to succeed to the shogunate but rather to succeed his father Tsunashige as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu.

In 1678 Tokugawa Tsunashige died and Tokugawa Ienobu succeeded him as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu. He became very powerful there since his uncle was the shogun.

In 1694, a &quot;rōnin&quot;, Arai Hakuseki, was appointed as personal tutor and advisor to Ienobu. Hakuseki used to be a teacher in Edo, but was recommended by the philosopher Kinoshita Jun&#x27;an to become personal tutor to Ienobu and was summoned to Ienobu&#x27;s Edo residence. Until 1709, when Ienobu became &quot;shōgun&quot;, it is thought that Hakuseki gave him 2000 lectures on the Chinese classics and Confucianism. This was helpful to Ienobu since Shogun Tsunayoshi had also been a great patron of the Chinese classics and of Neo-Confucianism. After Ienobu&#x27;s ascension, Hakuseki devoted the rest of his life to advising Ienobu, even writing a book for him, known as the &quot;Hankanpu&quot; covering the history of various fiefs from 1600 until 1680.

* Mother: Ohara no Kata later Choshoin (1637–1664)

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1709–1712)==
In 1709, &quot;shōgun&quot; Tsunayoshi died without a male heir. In genealogical terms, it would have appeared reasonable for the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kōfu, Tokugawa Ienobu, to be elevated to the role of &quot;shōgun&quot; because he was the only remaining direct lineal descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, this was a secondary factor in the context of intra-&quot;bakufu&quot; politics which were carried over from the last days of the Tsunayoshi &quot;bakufu&quot;. The ultimate resolution of any questions about shogunal succession were probably influenced most effectively by the fact that Ienobu was the expressed preference of the late &quot;shōgun&quot; Tsunayoshi&#x27;s wife.

Shogun Ienobu immediately began to reform certain elements of Japanese society. It is often said that he transformed the &quot;bakufu&quot; from a military to a civilian institution, which was already in the making during the rule of Ietsuna and Tsunayoshi. He started off by abolishing the controversial laws and edicts of Tsunayoshi. The chamberlains, who were given strict power by Tsunayoshi, had all power withdrawn from their hands. Also, in 1710, Shogun Ienobu revised the &quot;Buke-Sho-Hatto&quot;, where language was improved. Also, censorship was discontinued, and Ienobu told his subordinates that the thoughts and feelings of the populace should reach the high levels of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. This is thought to be Hakuseki&#x27;s influence. Cruel punishments and persecutions were discontinued, and the judicial system was also reformed.

However, there was one remnant of &quot;shōgun&quot; Tsunayoshi&#x27;s rule which was not done away with. Neo-Confucianism was still popular and patronized, also thanks to Hakuseki&#x27;s influence, since he had long lectured Ienobu on the Confucian classics. Economic reform also was ensured, and the gold coin was created to stabilize the economy.

Shogun Ienobu was one of the first &quot;shōguns&quot; in centuries to actually try to significantly improve relations with the emperor and court in Kyoto. In 1711, the Fujiwara regent, Konoe Motohiro, arrived in Edo from Kyoto to be the mediator for talks between &quot;shōgun&quot; Ienobu and Emperor Nakamikado and his nobles (in Kyoto). Ienobu took the lead, but Motohiro also appears to have asserted himself. After the talks were over, it was decided that younger sons of emperors do not have to enter priesthood and can form new branches of the imperial throne and that their daughters can marry (in fact, one of the younger sisters of Emperor Nakamikado married Shogun Ienobu&#x27;s younger son, &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsugu) and that the &quot;bakufu&quot; would offer financial grants to the court. Many court ceremonies were also revived. Thus, during the rule of &quot;shōgun&quot; Ienobu, relations with the court were fairly good.

&quot;Shōgun&quot; Ienobu died at the age of 51 in &quot;Shōtoku&quot; 2, on the 14th day of the 10th month (1712). He was succeeded by his infant son, Tokugawa Ietsugu. Ietsugu became the seventh &quot;shōgun&quot;. He continued to employ Hakuseki as his adviser.

His Buddhist name was Bunshōin (文昭院) and buried in Zōjō-ji.

<doc id="469829" wikidata="Q366722" url="?curid=469829" title="Tokugawa Ietsugu">
<text>Tokugawa Ietsugu; 徳川 家継 (8 August 1709 – 19 June 1716) was the seventh &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty, who ruled from 1713 until his death in 1716. He was the son of Tokugawa Ienobu, thus making him the grandson of Tokugawa Tsunashige, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kofu, great-grandson of Tokugawa Iemitsu, great-great grandson of Tokugawa Hidetada, and finally the great-great-great grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

==Early life (1709–1713)==
Tokugawa Ietsugu was born in 1709 in Edo, being the eldest son of &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ienobu and concubine, Gekkōin. At that time, his father was &quot;shōgun&quot;, and was being advised by his long-time Confucian advisor, Arai Hakuseki, who held considerable influence in the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s court at Edo. At the time Ietsugu was born, his father, Ienobu, was 48. His childhood name was Nabematsu (鍋松). Arai had traced the Tokugawa family&#x27;s bloodline back to the Minamoto family, the founders of the first shogunate. Thus, Ietsuga also was called Minamoto no Ietsugu. He was only three years old when his father died, upon which he became &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsugu. He married Yoshiko no Miya (1714–1758), daughter of Emperor Reigen, in 1715; at that time he was only 4 years and Yoshiko no Miya was only one year old.

==Family==
* Father: Tokugawa Ienobu
* Mother: Gekkōin (1685–1752)
* Wife: Yasonomiya Yoshiko (1714–1758)

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1713–1716)==
Although &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsugu assumed the role as formal head of the &quot;bakufu&quot;, he was still a toddler. As he was not old or able enough to rule, he was put under the protection and advice of Confucian scholar Arai Hakuseki. Two problems were addressed during Ietsugu&#x27;s reign: currency reform and foreign trade in Kyūshū. Ietsugu did not take much care of the country&#x27;s matters; and his advisors, namely Arai Hakuseki, addressed them.

In 1715, he married Yoshiko-no-miya, daughter of Emperor Reigen. He was 5 years old, she was 1 years old.

In 1713, prices were rising. Thus, after various proposals (most after the death of Ienobu) submitted to Shogun Ietsugu and Arai, it was decided to create a new currency. In 1714, the new metallic currency was introduced. While rice had increased during the rule of Ienobu, after the currency was introduced during the rule of Ietsugu, it fell to a lower level.

The currency reform was closely linked to foreign trade. In 1716, only Dutch and Chinese merchant ships could trade from Dejima in Nagasaki. Reform of the currency system also led to reform of trade rules as well. In 1716, a document was addressed saying that the &quot;bakufu&quot; would appoint two commissioners of Foreign Trade in Edo and Nagasaki, and that 30 Chinese ships and 2 Dutch ships be allowed to enter the country each year. Nonetheless, Japan still remained very isolated.

==Death==

In &quot;Shōtoku&quot; 6, on the 30th day of the 4th month (1716), Shogun Ietsugu died of complications of a cold, at the age of six. He had not done much to rule—but was thought of as a playful and mischievous character. Since he had no children the direct descendant of Tokugawa Iemitsu came to an end. Nonetheless, there were still collateral lineal branches descended from Ieyasu through one of his many children, and the new &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Yoshimune, was chosen from one of these lineal Tokugawa branches. His Buddhist name was Yushoin and buried in Zōjō-ji.

The years in which Ietsugu was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

<text>Earl of Selborne, in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1882 for the lawyer and Liberal politician Roundell Palmer, 1st Baron Selborne, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Wolmer, of Blackmoor in the County of Southampton. He had already been made Baron Selborne, of Selborne in the County of Southampton, in 1872, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both his son, the second Earl, and grandson, the third Earl, were prominent Liberal Unionist politicians. The latter was in 1941 called to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s barony of Selborne. The third Earl&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Earl, served as one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat as a Conservative. As of 2021, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fifth earl, who succeeded his father in that year.

The family seat is Temple Manor, near Selborne, Hampshire.

<text>Carlton Ernest Fisk (born December 26, 1947), nicknamed &quot;Pudge&quot; and &quot;the Commander&quot;, is an American former professional baseball catcher who played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox. In 1972, he was the first player to be unanimously voted American League (AL) Rookie of the Year. Fisk is best known for his game-winning home run in the 12th inning of Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, during which he memorably waved his arms hoping for the batted ball to remain fair.

At the time of his retirement, Fisk held the record for most home runs all-time by a catcher with 376 (since surpassed by Mike Piazza). He has held several age- or longevity-related records, including the record for most games played at the position of catcher with 2,226 (later surpassed by Iván Rodríguez, who also shared Fisk&#x27;s nickname &quot;Pudge&quot;). Fisk still holds the AL record for most years served at the position (24). Fisk was voted to the All-Star team 11 times and won three Silver Slugger Awards which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position. In 2000, Fisk was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Fisk was born in Bellows Falls, Vermont, but according to Fisk, that was only because Bellows Falls had the nearest hospital to his hometown, Charlestown, New Hampshire. He was raised by his parents, Leona and Cecil, along with older brother Calvin, younger brothers Conrad and Cedric and younger sisters Janet and June. He grew up in Charlestown, across the Connecticut River from Bellows Falls. Fisk attended Charlestown High School, where he played baseball (under Coach Ralph Silva), soccer, and basketball. Because his family is from New Hampshire, he insisted that the organization remove from his plaque in the Red Sox Hall of Fame its characterization of him as a Vermont native. Fisk earned his longtime nickname, &quot;Pudge&quot;, because he was a chubby youngster.

He played on the Charlestown High baseball team, appearing at third base, catcher and pitcher for Coach Silva. Two of his teammates were his brothers Calvin and Conrad, who were drafted by the Baltimore Orioles and Montreal Expos, respectively, but never made it to the minors due to Calvin&#x27;s being drafted and inducted into military service during the Vietnam War and Conrad hurting his arm. Since the high school baseball season was limited to 17 games annually due to the inclement New England weather, he also played in the American Legion baseball league in 1964, appearing with the team from Claremont, New Hampshire. In 1965, he played for the Legion Post 37 team in Bellows Falls that had won the 1964 Vermont State Championship.

Fisk excelled at basketball. When he was a sophomore, he was a starter and helped Charlestown to an undefeated season and the 1963 New Hampshire Class M championship. His play in a 1964 high school basketball tournament in the Boston Garden drew the attention of Boston Celtics owner Walter Brown, who told a local reporter, &quot;You have got to tell me—who is that kid?&quot; Fisk had 42 points and 38 rebounds in the 1965 state tournament semifinal loss to Hopkinton High School. He was awarded a basketball scholarship by the University of New Hampshire, where he started for the UNH Wildcats while also playing baseball. He met his wife Linda Foust while at UNH. The freshman team that Fisk played for was undefeated for the 1965–66 season. In 1966, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Orleans Cardinals. In his sophomore year, the Red Sox drafted him in the first round of the January 1967 amateur draft, and his athletic future was set. Fisk gave up his dreams of basketball glory. &quot;I could never be a six-foot-two power forward and play for the Celtics,&quot; he said.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1967, Fisk played briefly for the Red Sox team in the Florida Instructional League, hitting .195 with 0 HR and 0 RBI in 47 at bats.

In 1968, Fisk played for the Waterloo Hawks, the Red Sox&#x27; Class A affiliate in the Midwest League. In 62 games, Fisk hit .338 with 12 HR and 34 RBI.

Fisk played 28 games for the Red Sox in the Florida Instructional League in 1969, hitting .245 with 4 HR and 19 RBI. He then played for the Class AA Pittsfield Red Sox of the Eastern League, where he hit .243 with 10 HR and 41 RBI in 97 games and 309 at-bats. Finally, he made his major league debut, appearing in 2 games for the Boston Red Sox in 1969.

In 1970, Fisk played for the Class AA Pawtucket Red Sox, where he batted .229 with 12 HR and 44 RBI in 93 games.

Fisk played for the Class AAA Louisville Colonels of the International League in 1971, hitting .263 with 10 HR and 43 RBI in 93 games, before being called up to the Boston Red Sox.

===Boston Red Sox (1969, 1971–1980)===

Fisk joined the Army Reserve in 1967. After a short stint of active duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where Fisk finished his initial training, he served as a member of the 393rd Service and Supply Battalion in Chester, Vermont, completing monthly weekend drills and two-week annual training periods until 1971.

Fisk was once again called up from the minors at the end of 1971 and earned himself a place on Boston&#x27;s 1972 spring training roster. As history would have it, Fisk broke into the major leagues (to stay) early in the 1972 season. Boston manager Darrell Johnson, whom Fisk credited for making him a major leaguer, taught Fisk how to be a leader and a field general for the team. Playing with abandon and all-out aggressiveness was one thing, channeling energy intelligently was another. &quot;Johnson taught me to think about all the important facets of the catcher&#x27;s role, the things that help pitchers in various ways and those that let your teammates know you want to win,&quot; he told an interviewer in 1973.

On September 12, 1971, Fisk hit his first career home run off of Detroit&#x27;s Les Cain at Tiger Stadium. In , Fisk batted .293 with 22 home runs, and a .909 OPS. In addition, he led the American League with nine triples (tied with Oakland&#x27;s Joe Rudi), and was the last catcher to lead the AL in this statistical category. His play earned him both the AL Gold Glove and AL Rookie of the Year awards. He was selected unanimously for the latter award, becoming the first unanimous AL Rookie of the Year. He also finished fourth in American League MVP voting.

In June 1974, Fisk suffered a devastating knee injury when Leron Lee of the Cleveland Indians collided with him at home plate, tearing several knee ligaments. After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery, Fisk was told he would never play again, yet the backstop returned just twelve months later.

In , Fisk re-injured himself in spring training and did not play until June. In only 79 game appearances, Fisk hit .331 along with 52 RBI. Boston won the AL East Division with a record of 95–65.

====1975 ALCS and World Series====
Fisk batted .417 in the 1975 ALCS, as Boston swept the three-time defending champion Oakland Athletics.

In Game 3 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium, Fisk led off the second inning with a solo home run off Cincinnati starter Gary Nolan. In the bottom of the 10th inning, Reds pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister collided with Fisk at home plate while starting to run out a sacrifice bunt, leading to a wild throw by Fisk to second base that allowed Cesar Geronimo to reach third base and eventually score the winning run. Fisk and Boston manager Darrell Johnson argued the controversial call, claiming that Armbrister should have been ruled out for interference, but home plate umpire Larry Barnett ruled otherwise. &quot;To this day, I still think it was interference,&quot; said Fisk in an interview after his retirement.

Leading off the bottom of the 12th inning of Game 6 at Fenway Park, Fisk hit a pitch off of Cincinnati relief pitcher Pat Darcy that went down the left-field line and appeared to be heading into foul territory. The image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is considered by many to be one of baseball&#x27;s greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic. &quot;The celebration of that moment has made me realize how popular baseball is and how it affects people&#x27;s lives,&quot; Fisk told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s still the greatest moment in my career.&quot;

The image of him waving the ball fair changed the way baseball was televised. During this time, cameramen covering baseball were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. In a 1999 interview, NBC cameraman Lou Gerard said that he had been distracted by a nearby rat. Unable to follow the ball, he kept the camera on Fisk instead. This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves.

====Last years in Boston====
Fisk was among the top offensive catchers in the American League in his eight full seasons with the Boston Red Sox. His best year in Boston was in 1977, when he hit .315 with 26 home runs and 102 runs batted in.

Facing the rival New York Yankees in the 1978 AL East Playoff, Fisk went 1-for-3 with a single in Boston&#x27;s 5–4 loss to the Yankees. Some fans attributed Boston&#x27;s 1978 loss to a rib injury sustained by Fisk. The same injury left Fisk on the sidelines for several games during the 1979 season, a year in which his primary position was designated hitter.

Fisk was reportedly among a group of several Red Sox players who lobbied Boston management for players to be paid what they deserved, which made him none too popular with Haywood Sullivan, the Boston general manager. When Fisk&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the 1980 season, Sullivan in fact mailed him a new contract, but put it in the mail one day after the contractual deadline. As a result, Fisk became a free agent. In 11 years with the Boston Red Sox, Fisk was selected to seven All-Star games, and batted .284 with 161 home runs and 568 RBI. He nearly had more RBIs than strikeouts, striking out only 588 times in 4353 plate appearances with the Red Sox, with an OBP of .356.

===Chicago White Sox (1981–1993)===
Fisk signed a five-year contract for $3.5 million with the White Sox on March 18, 1981. Fisk had worn number 27 with the Red Sox but it was worn by White Sox pitcher Ken Kravec. Fisk chose to wear 72 with the White Sox explaining that he had won American League Rookie of the Year in 1972; his son Carson had been born in 1972; and 72 was the reverse of 27. Although Kravec was traded just ten days later, Fisk retained the number 72 throughout his career with the White Sox. As the season got underway, Fisk was interviewed by the media concerning his switching teams, and joked that &quot;after a decade with the Red Sox, it was time to change my sox!&quot; On opening day 1981, Fisk started the season with the White Sox against his former team in Fenway Park. In the eighth inning, Fisk knocked a three-run homer to put his new team on top, 5–3.

After joining the White Sox, he helped the team win its first American League Western Division title in . His .289 batting average, 26 home runs, and 86 RBI, as well as his leadership on the young team, helped him to finish third in the MVP voting (behind Baltimore teammates Cal Ripken Jr. and Eddie Murray). Fisk also caught LaMarr Hoyt that season, the 1983 Cy Young Award winner. Fisk played poorly in Chicago&#x27;s loss to the Baltimore Orioles in the 1983 ALCS, hitting .176 with zero runs batted in.

On May 16, 1984, Fisk accomplished the rare feat of hitting for the cycle in Comiskey Park against the Kansas City Royals. Fisk&#x27;s triple in the bottom of the seventh inning off Dan Quisenberry was the only triple he hit in the season. Injuries once again befell Fisk in the 1984 season, limiting him to just 102 games and a .231 average. The experience led him to begin a new training regimen which he used for the rest of his career. In his Hall of Fame induction speech, Fisk credited White Sox strength and conditioning coach Phil Claussen for his turnaround. Claussen introduced Fisk to a more scientific approach to physical conditioning which included long sessions of weight training. Fisk often credited the training program with extending his career.

In 1985, following the advent of his new training program, Fisk had the most productive offensive year of his career. He hit 37 home runs and drove in 107 runs, both career-high numbers; the home run numbers tied Dick Allen&#x27;s 13-year White Sox single-season record. At the age of 37, Fisk tied his career high for stolen bases (17). He was voted to the All-Star team, won the Silver Slugger award and finished 13th in the A.L. MVP voting.

On August 4, 1985, Fisk caught all nine innings of Tom Seaver&#x27;s complete game 300th career victory, which was played in Yankee Stadium. Fisk caught Bobby Thigpen as he set the then-record for most saves in a season (57) in 1990. In 2005, Jack McDowell credited Fisk as being instrumental in his development into a pitcher who won the Cy Young Award in 1993.

After the 1985 season, the White Sox came close to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for designated hitter Don Baylor. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play every day as he wanted (despite being the team&#x27;s regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players would have to agree to the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when they were unable to reach an agreement. The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees traded Baylor to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter Mike Easler.

On August 17, 1990, in the second game of a twi-night doubleheader in Arlington, Texas Fisk broke Johnny Bench&#x27;s career home run record for catchers by hitting his 328th longball as a catcher off Charlie Hough in the top of the second inning. He went on to end his career as the all-time leader in home runs by a catcher with 351. On May 5, 2004 Mike Piazza surpassed Fisk&#x27;s record by belting his 352nd as a backstop. Fisk still holds the American League record for homers by a catcher.
A single in the 1991 All-Star Game made him the oldest player in MLB history to collect a hit in an All-Star game.

The 1993 season was Fisk&#x27;s last. In February, Fisk and the Sox had a dispute over signing a one-year deal, where the former alleged it was only a minor league deal and the latter asserting it as a technicality to protect the 40-man roster. Owner Jerry Reinsdorf called him a &quot;prima donna&quot;, but the two sides eventually reached a deal.

On June 22, 1993, Fisk broke Bob Boone&#x27;s record for career games caught with his 2,226th game behind the plate. Fisk was passed on this list by Iván Rodríguez on June 17, 2009.

Six days after breaking Bob Boone&#x27;s all-time games caught record, Fisk was abruptly released by the Chicago White Sox at age 45. Fisk was notified of his dismissal in his hotel room in Cleveland while on a road trip with the team. It is reported that he was ordered to turn in his equipment and immediately fly back to Chicago, alone. To add insult to injury, Fisk was thrown out of the White Sox clubhouse later that season when he stopped by to wish his teammates good luck in the playoffs. Fisk was one of two final active players in the 1990s who had played in the 1960s. The other was Nolan Ryan. He is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in MLB games in four decades.

In thirteen seasons with the White Sox, Fisk was selected to four All-Star games and batted .257 with 214 home runs and 762 RBI. Fisk had nearly as many RBIs as strikeouts with the White Sox, striking out 798 times in 5,500 plate appearances.

For his career, Fisk caught a then-record 2,226 games over 24 seasons. Playing in 2,499 total games, Fisk also played 41 games in left field, 27 games at 1B and four games at 3B and was a DH for 166 games in his career. Overall he hit .269 with 376 home runs and 1,330 RBI in his career.

Fisk made mention of the fireworks between himself and Reinsdorf in his Hall of Fame induction speech, and Fisk was inducted with a Red Sox cap, although both teams retired his number, with the White Sox doing it first with his number 72 on September 14, 1997, and the Red Sox with his number 27 in 2000. In 2005, he had a statue dedicated at U.S. Cellular Field in 2005. In 2008, Fisk officially rejoined the White Sox organization by becoming a team ambassador and part of the White Sox speaker&#x27;s bureau.

===Notable feuds===
Fisk was known for his longstanding feud with New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson. One particular incident that typified their feud, and the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry in general, occurred on August 1, 1973, at Fenway Park. With the score 2–2 in the top of the ninth inning, Munson, attempting to score on Gene Michael&#x27;s missed bunt attempt, barreled into Fisk, triggering a 10-minute bench-clearing brawl in which both catchers were ejected.
As John Curtis let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, the scrawny Yankees shortstop tried to step in Fisk&#x27;s way, but Fisk elbowed him out of the way and braced for Munson, who crashed into him as hard as he could. Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson tried to lie on top of him to allow Felipe Alou to keep rounding the bases. Fisk kicked Munson off him and into the air, and swiped at him with his fist. Michael grabbed Fisk, and as Curtis grabbed Munson—his former Cape Cod League roommate—Fisk threw Michael down with his left arm and fell to the ground. &quot;Fisk had his left arm right across Stick&#x27;s throat and wouldn&#x27;t let up&quot;, said Ralph Houk, the Yankees&#x27; manager at the time. &quot;Michael couldn&#x27;t breathe. I had to crawl underneath the pile to try to pry Fisk&#x27;s arm off his throat to keep him from killing Stick. All the while he had Michael pinned down, he was punching Munson underneath the pile. I had no idea Fisk was that strong, but he was scary.&quot;
In another incident typifying the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, Fisk was involved in an altercation with Lou Piniella during a May 20, 1976, game at Yankee Stadium. In the sixth inning of this game, Piniella barreled into Fisk trying to score on an Otto Vélez single. Fisk and Piniella shoved each other at home plate, triggering another bench-clearing brawl. After order appeared to be restored, Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles began exchanging words and punches, igniting the brawl anew. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder in the altercation and missed much of the season and was never quite the same again.

In an incident on May 22, 1990, Deion Sanders approached the plate with one out and a runner on third base, drew a dollar sign in the dirt before the pitch, and didn&#x27;t run to first base since the popup he hit looked like it would be easily caught. Fisk yelled at Sanders &quot;run the fucking ball out&quot; and called Sanders a &quot;piece of shit.&quot; Later in the game, Sanders told Fisk &quot;the days of slavery are over.&quot; Fisk was furious. &quot;He comes up and wants to make it a racial issue — there&#x27;s no racial issue involved.&quot; He told Sanders during Sanders&#x27; next at-bat, &quot;There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game. You&#x27;re playing it the wrong way. And the rest of us don&#x27;t like it. Someday, you&#x27;re going to get this game shoved right down your throat.&quot;

In May 2008, Fisk returned to the White Sox as a team ambassador, and a member of the team&#x27;s speakers bureau.

The 2004 baseball-themed film &quot;Mickey&quot; features a character who, like Fisk, is a catcher, is known as Pudge, and hits a home run similar to Fisk&#x27;s 1975 World Series home run. Footage of Fisk&#x27;s home run appears in the 1997 film &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, during a scene in which the character Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) tells the story of how he met his wife on the same day the game occurred.

===The Fisk Foul Pole===
On June 13, 2005, the Red Sox honored Carlton Fisk and the 12th-inning home run that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series by naming the left field foul pole, which the famous home run contacted, the &quot;Fisk Foul Pole&quot;. In a pregame ceremony from the Monster Seats, Fisk was cheered by the Fenway Park crowd while the shot was replayed to the strains of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot;, the song longtime Fenway Park organist John Kiley originally played following the home run. The Red Sox scheduled the ceremony to coincide with an interleague series against the Cincinnati Reds, who were making their first trip back to Fenway Park since the &#x27;75 Series.

Thirty years later, the video of Fisk trying to wave the ball fair remains one of the game&#x27;s enduring images. Game 6 is often considered one of the best games played in Major League history. The crowd remembered that magical moment at precisely 12:34 a.m. ET early on the morning of October 22, 1975, when Fisk drove a 1–0 fastball from Cincinnati right-hander Pat Darcy high into the air, heading down the left-field line. &quot;The ball only took about two and half seconds&quot;, recalled Fisk. &quot;It seemed like I was jumping and waving for more than two and a half seconds.&quot; Two and a half seconds later, the ball caromed off the bright yellow pole, ending one of the most dramatic World Series games ever played and giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win over the Reds in 12 hard-fought innings.

On the field, Fisk threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his former batterymate Luis Tiant. From now on, like the Pesky Pole down the right-field line, the left-field pole will officially be called the &quot;Fisk Foul Pole&quot;. The idea was the inspiration of the countless fans who contacted the Red Sox about recognizing the historic moment. Fenway&#x27;s right field foul pole, which is just from the plate, is named Pesky&#x27;s Pole for former Red Sox shortstop Johnny Pesky. Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky in when he won a game with a home run just inside the right-field pole.

===Rings===
After the June 13 ceremony in Boston, Fisk received an honorary World Series ring from the Red Sox commemorating their 2004 World Series victory. On Saturday, August 12, 2006, the Chicago White Sox presented Fisk with another ring, this one in honor of the White Sox&#x27; 2005 championship.

===Statue===
The Chicago White Sox unveiled a life-sized bronze statue of Carlton Fisk on August 7, 2005. The statue is located inside Rate Field on the main concourse in center field. It joined similar statues depicting Charles Comiskey, Frank Thomas and Minnie Miñoso and eventually Luis Aparicio, Nellie Fox, Billy Pierce and Harold Baines.

* In 1997, the Chicago White Sox retired Fisk&#x27;s number 72.
* Fisk was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997.

<doc id="469842" wikidata="Q7888773" url="?curid=469842" title="Kamp Staaldraad">
<text>Kamp Staaldraad (Afrikaans words, translated idiomatically as &quot;Camp Barbed Wire&quot;) was a military-style &quot;boot camp&quot; organized as a &quot;team building&quot; exercise for the South African national rugby union team, the Springboks (or Boks), during their preparation for the 2003 Rugby World Cup (RWC). Details of the camp emerged in the South African media, resulting in protest from the upper administrative levels of South African rugby.

Soon after the naming of the Springboks World Cup team in September 2003, Boks coach Rudolf Straeuli arranged for the team to go to a police camp in the South African bush, near the town of Thabazimbi. He delegated the responsibility for running the team camp. Several members of staff proclaimed the intention was to banish a sense of individuality from players.

Soon after the Boks were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Rugby World Cup, a South African newspaper reported that before the RWC, the Boks had been sent to a boot camp where players had allegedly been ordered into a freezing lake naked to pump up rugby balls underwater. The story also alleged that players who tried to get out of the lake, including Boks captain Corné Krige, were forced back in at gunpoint. Within days, several South African newspapers ran pictures leaked from the camp, showing players standing naked in the lake and holding rugby balls in front of their private parts, and shivering Boks players huddled naked in a pit. The whistleblower emerged as Boks video analyst Dale McDermott.

In the days that followed, the media reported other details from the camp:
*The team was ordered to climb into a foxhole naked and sing the national anthem while ice-cold water were being poured over their heads. During their time in the hole, recordings of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (used as England&#x27;s national anthem) and the New Zealand All Blacks haka were played at full volume.
*It was confirmed that firearms were present at the camp, although reports varied as to whether they were ever pointed at anyone.
*The players were forced to crawl naked across gravel.
*They also were ordered to spend a night in the bush, during which they were to kill and cook chickens, but not eat them.
* The players had to participate in bare-knuckle fights with each other.

Most South Africans condemned Kamp Staaldraad, including the South African military forces; a spokesman for the South African National Defence Force pointedly told the &quot;Cape Times&quot; newspaper that the force never trained its recruits naked, and he knew of no military organization in the world that did so. Many rugby observers also pointed out that trying to eliminate all individuality from a team could be counterproductive, as there are many times during a rugby match when individual initiative can make the difference between victory and defeat.

Straeuli defended the camp as more details became public, but eventually resigned. Higher-ups in the country&#x27;s rugby establishment initially refused to distance themselves from Kamp Staaldraad; many of them were purged at the same time as Straeuli. The Boks&#x27; disappointing results in 2003 (early exit from the RWC; record losses to France, England, Scotland, and New Zealand; a last-minute win over Argentina) were enough by themselves to threaten the jobs of Straeuli and many rugby executives. However, their attempts to defend Kamp Staaldraad apparently were the last straw for many South African rugby supporters, and for many within the rugby establishment who saw the need for dramatic change.

In a tragic postscript to the story, McDermott was found dead from a bullet wound to the head at his home in Durban on 9 January 2005. His death was eventually determined to be a suicide; no foul play had been suspected. McDermott&#x27;s mother reported that he had suffered extreme clinical depression in the months leading to his death. After supplying the images that led to the controversy, he was forced to leave his job at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (from which he had been contracted out to the Boks) and returned to teaching at Durban High School. Jake White, who took over as Boks coach after the forced resignation of Straeuli, tried to bring McDermott back into the Boks staff, but SA Rugby vetoed the re-appointment.

<doc id="469845" wikidata="Q5326241" url="?curid=469845" title="Earl of Cranbrook">
<text>Earl of Cranbrook is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1892 for Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, Viscount Cranbrook. The title is named after Cranbrook in the county of Kent. The Gathorne-Hardy family seat is Great Glemham House, near Saxmundham, Suffolk. 

==History==
It was created in 1892 for the prominent Conservative politician Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Viscount Cranbrook, son of John Hardy. He notably held office as Home Secretary, Lord President of the Council, Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for India. Gathorne-Hardy gained the warm-personal regard of Queen Victoria, and had already been created Viscount Cranbrook, of Hemsted in the County of Kent, in 1878, and was made Baron Medway, of Hemsted in the County of Kent, at the same time he was given the earldom. The latter title is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent.

Lord Cranbrook&#x27;s eldest son, the second Earl, represented Rye, Mid Kent and Medway in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His son, the third Earl, was gazetted as an officer and private secretary New Zealand.

John David Gathorne-Hardy, 4th Earl of Cranbrook (who was previously married to his cousin Bridget D&#x27;Oyly Carte) married Fidelity Seebohm (born 1912), on 26 July 1932 and had five children, including Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 5th Earl of Cranbrook, the current earl.

 the titles are held by Gathorne, the fifth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1978. He is a zoologist and environmental biologist formerly active in Malaya, who was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1995. He was Chairman of the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature.

=== Notable family members ===

Hon. Alfred Gathorne-Hardy, third son of the first Earl, sat as a Member of Parliament for Canterbury and East Grinstead. Lady Margaret Evelyn Gathorne-Hardy, daughter of the first Earl, was the wife of the 2nd Viscount Goschen, Viceroy of India.

Hon. Edward Gathorne-Hardy, second son of the third Earl, was a traveller, botanist and socialite who lived in Athens. He was famously eccentric and rumoured to have been in a relationship with Anthony Eden. Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy, daughter of the third Earl, was the wife of Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte. Another member of the family was the writer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, a son of Hon. Anthony Gathorne-Hardy, youngest son of the third Earl.

<text>Cowdenbeath () is a town and burgh in west Fife, Scotland. It is north-east of Dunfermline and north of the capital, Edinburgh. The town grew up around the extensive coalfields of the area and became a police burgh in 1890. According to a 2008 estimate, the town has a population of 14,081.

The wider civil parish of Beath has a population of 17,351 (in 2011).

==Toponymy==
The first element of the town&#x27;s name comes from the surname &quot;Colden&quot; or &quot;Cowden&quot;, often indicated in early forms as a possessor by the addition of , for example &quot;Cowdennyes Baith&quot;. &quot;Beath&quot;, the name of the wider parish, is from the Gaelic , meaning birch.

==History==
The earliest indication of human activity in the immediate vicinity of the current site of Cowdenbeath was provided by the discovery of late Bronze Age vessels containing incinerated human remains, in 1928. An article by eminent archaeologist A.D. Lacaille F.S.A Scot details the find of a late bronze-age cemetery near Tollie Hill. One of the urns found contained fragments of processed Arran pitchstone, indicating some economic activity and commerce.
There is no evidence of a permanent settlement establishing itself around the current site of Cowdenbeath until the designation of the original Beath Kirk as a parish church in 1429-30 to act as a focal point to serve the surrounding area. The earliest written record of Beath (Beth) was found in a charter of Inchcolm Abbey, dated 6 March 1178. This charter makes reference to the Chapel of Beth. Although it is generally accepted that the word &quot;beath&quot; in Gaelic means ’birch’, P.W. Brown suggests that the word means ‘abode’ or ‘a settlement.’ In 1643 the Reverend John Row of Carnock, a leading opponent of episcopacy, was instrumental in establishing the Parish of Beath as an entity in its own right by separating it from the parish of Dalgety Bay and Aberdour. This significant date followed the building of a new church in 1640 at Beath, to replace the ruins of a sanctuary, which had fallen into sad disrepair. The present church, visible today, was constructed in 1834–35 by James MacFarlane and was altered in 1884–1886. It is alleged that the infamous graverobbers Burke and Hare sourced some of their cadavers from Beath Cemetery, to supply to the Scottish surgeon Robert Knox for dissection. Precautions were taken at Beath Cemetery to prevent body-snatching and for many years what were taken to be two iron coffins without lids dug up from the old churchyard lay near the old hearse house. These were not actually coffins, but old-time safes that were placed over the coffin to hinder the work of the body-snatchers. Another preventative measure adopted was the placing of a large flat stone on top of the grave. This stone was very heavy and was placed on the grave and removed by means of a trestle hoist, the rope going through the stone and fastened on the underside, and it remained there until the danger of &quot;snatching&quot; was past. The two &quot;safes&quot; have since disappeared, but the flat stone is still to be seen near the church. The Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, published in 1654 by eminent 17th-century Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, refers to Cowden Beth in the current vicinity of Cowdenbeath.
When the actual name of &quot;Cowdenbeath&quot; came into being is not known. In 1626, the area belonged to Willielmus Walker, a citizen of Dunfermline who owned the territory of &quot;BaitheMoubray alias Cowdounes - baithe&quot; meaning Cowdens part of Beath, where Beath meant Birch Trees. However, it is thought to have originated when turnpike roads were first made and that it marked the spot of an inn and later of a tollhouse erected in the 17th century.

By 1790 the records show that the parish of Beath had about 100 families whose livelihood came mainly from the soil. The fact that Beath Church served a very large area led to the creation of many &quot;kirke roads&quot;, roads that form rights-of-way even today. This church was replaced by the present church, built in 1832 and enlarged in 1886.

Cowdenbeath first came into prominence around 1820 as a stop on the north-bound coaching route to Perth. Indeed, Queen Victoria&#x27;s entourage stopped at the Cowdenbeath Coaching Inn to change horses on her first trip to Scotland in 1842, en route for Balmoral. The coaching inn, the Old Inn, was established at the junction of roads from North Queensferry, Perth, Dunfermline and Burntisland. When the new turnpike road from Queensferry to Perth was constructed, the inn gained more importance.

Before 1850, Cowdenbeath was just a collection of farms within the parish of Beath. The area was divided into four districts named after local farms: Kirkford, Foulford, White Threshes and Cowdenbeath farm, close to the present-day site of Central Park. Local inhabitants of these focal points of growth, which were merging into a single town, met to decide on a name for the emerging town. The eventual decision was narrowed down to either White Threshes or Cowdenbeath and Cowdenbeath was the chosen name. The arrival of the Oakley Iron Company around 1850 was to have a long-lasting impact upon Cowdenbeath and make the name synonymous with coal mining for almost 100 years. Shafts were sunk in the vicinity of the old Foulford Washer. It was in the mining for ore that the discoveries of the coal seams were made, and pits were sunk at every corner of the town. Before this, coal had been mined at Fordell for over a century, but the discovery of the coal seams at the depth they were found came as a pleasant surprise, considering the dip in the coal strata at Fordell, as it was previously thought that the seams at Cowdenbeath would be at such a depth as to be almost unworkable.

By 1850, the flourishing coal pits of Kelty, Lochgelly, Donibristle, Fordell and Hill of Beath surrounded the hamlet of Cowdenbeath. Within the greater area, which later became the Burgh of Cowdenbeath, there was little mining activity. Gibson, of Hill of Beath and the Symes, of Cartmore, had opened small pits in the vicinity of Jubilee Park at the southern border of the burgh, and other small pits appear to have been worked in the vicinity of Union Street. However, the situation was about to change when (contrary to earlier speculation) the Oakley Iron Company proved the area was rich in iron and coal. The opening of the Dunfermline–Thornton railway, via Cowdenbeath, in 1848, enhanced the prospects for mining and pits were sunk in every corner of the area, primarily for ironstone but, when this became uneconomic around the late 1870s, for coal alone.

The Forth Iron Company took over the Oakley Iron Company around 1860 then amalgamated with the Cowdenbeath Coal Company in 1872. When the Fife Coal Company subsequently took them over in 1896, the Cowdenbeath Coal Company&#x27;s pits were listed as: Lumphinnans Nos. 1, 2, 7, and 11; Cowdenbeath Nos. 3, 7, and 9; Foulford No. 1 and Mossbeath. This effectively made the Fife Coal Company one of the largest coal-mining concerns in Scotland. Such was the upsurge in mining activity that the population of Cowdenbeath doubled (4,000–8,000) in the ten years between 1890 and 1900 and gave rise to the nickname &quot;Chicago of Fife&quot;. This was a significant increase on the 1820 figure of 120.

Such was the extent of the importance of Cowdenbeath to coal mining at the turn of the century (circa 1900) that several institutions essential to mining became established there. The headquarters of the Fife and Kinross Miners&#x27; Association were opened in Victoria Street on 8 October 1910, and the first mine rescue station opened at Cowdenbeath on 4 November 1910 on Stenhouse Street, opposite Beath High School. The Central Works, Cowdenbeath, (commonly referred to as &quot;the Workshops&quot;) were built in 1924 by the Fife Coal Company Limited in order to centralise its supervisory staff and to cope with the greater amount of manufacturing and maintenance work caused by the intensive mechanisation programme which was being introduced in its mines.

Another significant mining-related building, which reflected Cowdenbeath&#x27;s growing status at the forefront of mining technology, was the establishment of the Fife Mining School in 1895. The school had humble origins, operating out of two rooms in Broad Street School, until it was transferred to the basement of Beath High School on Stenhouse Street. It was not until 1936 that Fife Mining School acquired its own custom-built building on the site of the old Woodside House on Broad Street. The new Fife Mining School was erected at a cost of £22,500, and was opened on 22 March by Ernest Brown, MP, then parliamentary secretary to the mines department. The school trained apprentices in all aspects of the mining trade; however, it did have a temporary change of use during both world wars, when it was used to train women working in the munitions industry. The mining school closed in 1976, reflecting the diminishing role of coal mining in the community.

==Geography==
Cowdenbeath lies in south-western Fife, near the larger town of Dunfermline. The town lies in a low, undulating, arable landscape to the south-east of the Ochil Hills. Whilst for the main part Cowdenbeath is fairly level, significant portions of the town have succumbed to subsidence as a result of the network of mine shafts and tunnels underlying the town. Notably, photographs of Cowdenbeath High Street circa 1900 published in Stenlake Publications show a flat High Street in which it is possible to view its entire length from north to south under the overarching railway bridge. This is impossible today, as the subsidence on the High Street has been so great that the railway bridge now obscures the view from one end to the other.

The south and eastern boundaries of Cowdenbeath are circumscribed by the A92 main road to Kirkcaldy, and beyond that the peat-bog.

The western perimeter of Cowdenbeath merges into the neighbouring village of Hill of Beath, and is bound by the natural landscape of the gentle slopes of the hill itself, and by Loch Fitty. The proximity of the A92 to the south of Cowdenbeath, and to a lesser extent to the east, also serves to define its lower boundary.

The northern boundary of Cowdenbeath is characterised by a rural landscape, which merges into the Lochore Meadows Country Park (&quot;The Meadies&quot;). This formerly industrial/mining landscape, which was host to a number of pit-heads (including the Mary Pit, whose winding gear structure dominates the park as a monument to its mining legacy), is now a very picturesque area which provides leisure and recreational outdoor amenities.

==Demography==

According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the census locality of Cowdenbeath had a total resident population of 14,081, an increase of 21% on the 2001 census figure of 11,627. The proportional split of males to females at 48.5% to 51.5% is consistent with the proportional split by gender in both the Fife and Scottish populations.

The ethnic composition of the population of Cowdenbeath is predominantly &quot;white&quot;, accounting for 98.7% of the total population of Cowdenbeath of 14,081. The remaining 1.3% of the Cowdenbeath population comprises Asian, African, Caribbean and others. In comparison to Scotland as a whole, Cowdenbeath has a lower proportion of people of Asian and African ethnicities. The population pyramid for Cowdenbeath, derived from 2011 UK Census data exhibits a typically mature house shape, where population only really begins to taper off above the age of 75. There is a noticeable anomaly where a bulge appears in the 40 - 49 age bracket, which is representative of the baby-boomers born in the 1960s.

==Sport and leisure==

Cowdenbeath Leisure Centre is in Pit Road, next to Central Park in the centre of the town and has a swimming pool, gym, indoor sports facilities and three all-weather pitches for football. A small skatepark is situated outside the leisure centre. There are a number of playing fields around the town.

The expansive &#x27;Public Park&#x27; is towards the north of the town. It was established in 1910, and formally opened in 1911. The venture was largely funded by the Gothenburg Public House Society, which donated over £7,000 to the initiative.
In its prime the park boasted an ornate bandstand, a paddling pool, a putting course and swing park, and was a focal point for various leisure pursuits, and the venue for the annual &quot;Store&quot; (Co-operative Society) treat. Although most of these amenities have long since gone, the park is still tended by the local authority and provides a public open space for all to use.

Cowdenbeath also has a golf club, originally built as a nine-hole course on the old Dora Coal mine site. Work began in 1988 and the course was completed and ready for play in 1991. The length of the course was 3315 yards. The course was extended to eighteen holes and opened by Sir Michael Bonallack in 1996. The length of the course is now 6,207 yards, with a standard scratch score of 71. A new clubhouse was built and officially opened on 6 December 1998 by ex-provost James Cameron who had opened the first clubhouse. There had been a golf club at the northern end of the town before World War 2, resulting in one of the now-demolished houses being named Golf View. Central Park is a stadium in the centre of Cowdenbeath. It is home to Cowdenbeath F.C. and has a maximum capacity of 5,270 (1,620 covered seating). The stadium has a tarmac track encircling the football pitch, one of Britain&#x27;s fastest, used for stock car racing. Central Park is the site of Britain&#x27;s most northerly speedway track. The team based in Cowdenbeath were known as the Fife Lions and featured riders from Edinburgh Monarchs and Glasgow Tigers in a series of challenge matches against league teams and scratch sides. The speedway track, which staged eight meetings every year, including a world championship qualifying round, was unusual in that it featured a brick wall safety fence.

==Other amenities ==
The medical practice is situated on Stenhouse Street. There is a library situated at the north end of the High Street. The Police Station moved to former Co-op buildings at Brunton House in 2012. There is a post office near Brunton House at the south end of High Street. The red sandstone Town House building is situated towards the north end of the High Street. This sandstone is the same as that used to clad the original Beath High School (the basic structure of which was reinforced concrete) on Stenhouse street. Similar stone can be seen in the original school boundary wall, within which two minor school buildings remain and also the present care home which now occupies the site of the old high school proper.

==Education==
There are three primary schools in the town. Cowdenbeath Primary School serves the southern end of the town. Foulford Primary School serves the northern end of the town. St Bride&#x27;s Primary School, the only Roman Catholic primary, serves both the town as well as Crossgates, Hill of Beath, and Lumphinnans. Some pupils in the north-east and south-west of the town attend Lumphinnans and Hill of Beath primary schools respectively.
Cowdenbeath is also served by one secondary school. Beath High School was founded in 1910 as a grammar school, mainly for the children of local mine executives. It was an imposing building built of red sandstone and stood on Stenhouse Street. The mine works of the No.7 pit, whose original pit-head was in close proximity to the school, caused significant subsidence in latter years. A modern school was opened in 1964, built in Kirkford next to Kirk of Beath Church and cemetery. At this point the school was split, with the old building becoming the lower school, and subsequently commonly referred to as &quot;Old Beath&quot;, whilst the modern school was referred to as &quot;New Beath&quot;. The old building was demolished in the 1990s and in 2003 the &quot;new&quot; school itself was closed due to subsidence and a new public–private partnership school was built. It is maintained by Sodexo.

On 25 March 1983, Jane Cosans of Cowdenbeath changed discipline in Scottish schools. She was awarded £11,846 by the European Court of Human Rights, plus costs, as recompense for her son&#x27;s suspension from Beath High School for refusing to be belted. This significantly contributed to the banning of the use of the belt in Scottish schools.

<text>Jean-Léon Gérôme (; 11 May 1824 – 10 January 1904) was a French painter and sculptor in the style now known as academicism. His paintings were so widely reproduced that he was &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s most famous living artist by 1880.&quot; The range of his works includes historical paintings, Greek mythology, Orientalism, portraits, and other subjects. He is considered one of the most important painters from the academic period. He was also a teacher with a long list of students.

==Early life==

Jean-Léon Gérôme was born at Vesoul, Haute-Saône. It was here that Gérôme first received instruction in drawing during his youth in school. He was instructed by local artist and teacher Claude-Basile Cariage, under whom he produced work of sufficient quality to merit more auspicious tutelage. In 1840 he was sent to Paris at the age of 16 where he studied under Paul Delaroche, whom he later accompanied to Italy in 1843. He visited Florence, Rome, the Vatican and Pompeii. On his return to Paris in 1844, like many students of Delaroche, he joined the atelier of Charles Gleyre and studied there for a brief time. He then attended the . In 1846 he tried to enter the prestigious , but failed in the final stage because his figure drawing was inadequate.

His painting &quot;The Cock Fight&quot; (1846) is an academic exercise depicting a nude young man and a very thinly draped young woman with two fighting cocks, with the Bay of Naples in the background. He sent this painting to the Paris Salon of 1847, where it gained him a third-class medal. This work was seen as the epitome of the Neo-Grec movement that had formed out of Gleyre&#x27;s studio (including Henri-Pierre Picou and Jean-Louis Hamon), and was championed by the influential French critic Théophile Gautier, whose review made Gérôme famous and effectively launched his career.

Gérôme abandoned his dream of winning the Prix de Rome and took advantage of his sudden success. His paintings &quot;The Virgin, the Infant Jesus and Saint John&quot; and &quot;Anacreon, Bacchus and Eros&quot; took a second-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1848. In 1849, he produced the paintings &quot;Michelangelo&quot; (also called &quot;In his Studio&quot;) and &quot;A Portrait of a Lady&quot;.

In 1851, he decorated a vase later offered by Emperor Napoleon III of France to Prince Albert, now part of the Royal Collection at St. James&#x27;s Palace, London. He exhibited &quot;Greek Interior&quot;, &quot;Souvenir d&#x27;Italie&quot;, &quot;Bacchus and Love, Drunk&quot; in 1851; &quot;Paestum&quot; in 1852; and &quot;An Idyll&quot; in 1853.

==Important commissions==

In 1852, Gérôme received a commission to paint a large mural of an allegorical subject of his choosing. &quot;The Age of Augustus, the Birth of Christ&quot;, which combined the birth of Christ with conquered nations paying homage to Augustus, may have been intended to flatter Napoleon III, whose government commissioned the mural and who was identified as a &quot;new Augustus.&quot; A considerable down payment enabled Gérôme to travel and research, first in 1853 to Constantinople, together with the actor Edmond Got, and in 1854 to Greece and Turkey and the shores of the Danube, where he was present at a concert of Russian conscripts making music under the threat of a lash.
In 1853, Gérôme moved to the Boîte à Thé, a group of studios in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Paris. This became a meeting place for artists, writers and actors, where George Sand entertained the composers: Hector Berlioz, Johannes Brahms and Gioachino Rossini and the novelists Théophile Gautier and Ivan Turgenev.

In 1854, he completed another important commission, decorating the Chapel of St. Jerome in the church of St. Séverin in Paris. His &quot;Last Communion of St. Jerome&quot; in this chapel reflects the influence of the school of Ingres on his religious works.

To the Universal Exhibition of 1855 he contributed &quot;Pifferaro&quot;, &quot;Shepherd&quot;, and &quot;The Age of Augustus, the Birth of Christ&quot;, but it was the modest painting &quot;Recreation in a Russian Camp&quot; that garnered the most attention.

==Orientalism==

In 1856, Gérôme visited Egypt for the first time. His itinerary followed the classic Grand Tour of the Near East, up the Nile to Cairo, across to Faiyum, then further up the Nile to Abu Simbel, then back to Cairo, across the Sinai Peninsula through Sinai and up the Wadi el-Araba to Jerusalem and finally Damascus. This heralded the start of many Orientalist paintings depicting Arab religious practice, genre scenes and North African landscapes.
Among these are paintings in which the Oriental setting is combined with depictions of female nudity. &quot;The Slave Market&quot;, &quot;The Large Pool of Bursa&quot;, &quot;Pool in a Harem&quot;, and similar subjects were works of imagination in which Gérôme combined accurately observed Middle Eastern architectural details with idealized nudes painted in his Paris studio. (In 2019, the right wing populist party, Alternative for Germany, used &quot;The Slave Market&quot; in a campaign poster in the 2019 European Parliament election.)

In his travels, Gérôme collected artefacts and costumes for staging oriental scenes in the studio, and also made oil studies from nature for the backgrounds. In an autobiographical essay of 1878, Gérôme described how important oil sketches made on the spot were for him: &quot;Even when worn out after long marches under the bright sun, as soon as our camping spot was reached I got down to work with concentration. But Oh! How many things were left behind of which I carried only the memory away! And I prefer three touches of color on a piece of canvas to the most vivid memory, but one had to continue on with some regret.&quot;

Gérôme&#x27;s reputation was greatly enhanced at the Paris Salon of 1857 by his display of &quot;Egyptian Recruits Crossing the Desert&quot;, &quot;Memnon and Sesostris&quot;, &quot;Camels Watering&quot;, and &quot;Suite d&#x27;un bal masqué&quot; (purchased by the duc d&#x27;Aumale, now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly; a copy made by Gérôme in 1859, &quot;The Duel After the Masquerade&quot;, is in the Walters Art Museum).

==Return to Classical subjects==
In 1858, he helped to decorate the Paris house of Prince Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte in the Pompeian style. The prince had bought his &quot;Greek Interior&quot; (1850), a depiction of a brothel also in the Pompeian manner.

In &quot;Ave Caesar! Morituri te Salutant&quot;, shown at the Salon of 1859, Gérôme returned to the painting of Classical subjects, but the picture failed to interest the public. &quot;King Candaules&quot; (1859) and &quot;Phryne Before the Areopagus&quot; and &quot;Socrates Seeking Alcibiades in the House of Aspasia&quot; (both 1861) gave rise to some scandal by reason of the subjects selected by the painter, and inspired bitter attacks by Paul de Saint-Victor and Maxime Du Camp. Also at the 1861 Salon he exhibited &quot;Egyptian Chopping Straw&quot; and &quot;Rembrandt Biting an Etching&quot;, two very minutely finished works.

In 1863, he married Marie Goupil (1842–1912), the daughter of the international art dealer Adolphe Goupil. They had four daughters and one son. His oldest daughter was Jeanne (1863-1944) and she was followed by Suzanne (1867-1941; married to Aimé Morot), Blanche (1868-1918) and Madeleine (1875-1905). Upon his marriage he moved to a house in the Rue de Bruxelles, close to the Folies Bergère. He expanded it into a grand house with stables with a sculpture studio below and a painting studio on the top floor.

==Atelier at École des Beaux-Arts==

Gérôme was appointed as one of the three professors at the . He started with sixteen students. Between 1864 and 1904, more than 2,000 students received at least some of their art education through Gérôme&#x27;s atelier at the . Places in Gérôme&#x27;s atelier were limited, keenly sought and highly competitive. Only the best students were admitted and aspirants considered it an honour to be selected. Gérôme progressed his students through drawing from antique works, casts and followed by life study with live models generally selected on the basis of their physique, but occasionally for their facial expression in a sequence of exercises known as the &quot;academie.&quot; Students drew parts of a bust before the entire bust, then parts of the live model before preparing full figures. Only when they had mastered sketching were they permitted to work in oils. They were also taught to draw clearly and correctly before consideration of tonal qualities. In his school, the floor sloped so that students had the fullest view of the model from the rear of the room. Students sat around any model in order of seniority, with the more senior students towards the rear so that they could draw the full figure, while the more junior members sat towards the front and concentrated on the bust or other part of the anatomy.
According to John Milner, who studied with Gérôme, his atelier was the most &quot;riotous&quot; and &quot;lewd&quot; of all the studios at Beaux-Arts. Students were treated to bizarre initiation rites which included slashing each other&#x27;s canvases, throwing students down stairs, out of windows, and onto upturned stools, staging fencing matches on the model&#x27;s dais, in the nude and with paintbrushes loaded with paint.

Gérôme attended every Wednesday and Saturday, demanding punctilious attendance to his instructions. His reputation as a severe critic was well-known. One of his American students, Stephen Wilson Van Shaick, commented that Gérôme was &quot;merciless in judgement&quot; yet possessed a &quot;singular magnetism.&quot; Although Gérôme was very demanding of his students, he offered them considerable assistance outside Beaux-Arts, inviting them to his personal studio, making recommendations to the Salon on their behalf, and encouraging them to study with his colleagues.

==Honors and mid-career works==

Gérôme was elected, on his fifth attempt, a member of the Institut de France in 1865. Already a knight in the Légion d&#x27;honneur, he was promoted to an officer in 1867. In 1869, he was elected an honorary member of the British Royal Academy. The King of Prussia, Wilhelm I, awarded him the Grand Order of the Red Eagle, Third Class. His influence became extensive and he was a regular guest of Empress Eugénie at the Imperial Court in Compiègne.
Along with the most eminent French artists, he was invited to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français (Society of French Orientalist Painters), founded in 1893, named Gérôme honorary president. Gérôme was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1875 and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

&quot;The Execution of Marshal Ney&quot; was exhibited at the Salon of 1868. On behalf of Ney&#x27;s descendants, Gérôme was asked to withdraw the painting, but did not comply. The general reception was very split and the 1868 Salon marked the beginning of a lasting divide between Gérôme and many French art critics, who accused him of relying on literary techniques, of commercialising art, and of bringing politics into art. Henri Oulevay made a caricature where Gérôme is depicted in front of the wall with the art critics as the firing squad.
In 1872 Gérôme produced &quot;Pollice Verso&quot;, a painting of bloody gladiators and blood-thirsty Vestal virgins in the Colosseum that became one of his most famous works. Alexander Turney Stewart purchased the painting from Gérôme at a price of 80,000 francs, setting a new record for the artist. Gérôme&#x27;s imagery of the turned thumb to signal life or death for a fallen gladiator was repeated in a multitude of movies, from the silent era up to and including the 2000 Oscar-winner &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Gérôme returned successfully to the Salon in 1873 with his painting &quot;L&#x27;Eminence Grise&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), a colorful depiction of the main stair hall of the palace of Cardinal Richelieu, popularly known as the Red Cardinal (&quot;L&#x27;Eminence Rouge&quot;), who was France&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; ruler under King Louis XIII beginning in 1624. In the painting, François Leclerc du Tremblay, a Capuchin friar dubbed &quot;L&#x27;Eminence Grise&quot; (the Gray Cardinal), descends the ceremonial staircase immersed in reading the Bible while all others either bow before him or fix their gaze on him. As Richelieu&#x27;s chief adviser, &quot;L&#x27;Eminence Grise&quot; was called &quot;the power behind the throne,&quot; which became the known definition of his title.

From approximately 1876 to 1890, Gérôme frequently worked with model Emma Dupont, who posed for several of his works, including &quot;Nude (Emma Dupont)&quot; (1876), &quot;The End of the Sitting&quot; (1886), &quot;Omphale&quot; (1887), &quot;Working in Marble, or The Artist Sculpting Tanagra&quot; (1890), and &quot;Tanagra&quot; (1890).

==Sculpture==

In his thirties, Gérôme took up sculpture. His first work was a large bronze statue of a gladiator holding his foot on his victim, based on his painting Pollice Verso (1872) and shown to the public at the Universal Exhibition of 1878. The same year he exhibited a marble statue at the Salon of 1878, based on his early painting &quot;Anacreon, Bacchus and Eros&quot; (1848).

Aware of contemporary experiments of tinting marble (such as by those by John Gibson), he produced &quot;Dancer with Three Masks&quot; combining movement with color, first exhibited in 1902 and now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen.

Among his other sculptures are &quot;Omphale&quot; (1887) and the statue of the duc d&#x27;Aumale which stands in front of the Château de Chantilly (1899).

He experimented with mixed ingredients, using for his statues tinted marble, bronze and ivory inlaid with precious stones and paste. His &quot;Dancer&quot; was exhibited in 1891. 
His lifesize statue &quot;Bellona&quot;, in ivory, bronze, and gemstones, attracted great attention at the 1892 exhibition in the Royal Academy of London.

Gérôme then began a series of conquerors, wrought in gold, silver and gems: &quot;Bonaparte Entering Cairo&quot; (1897), &quot;Tamerlane&quot; (1898), and &quot;Frederick the Great&quot; (1899).

In 1903 Gérôme executed a two sculpture commission, &quot;Metallugical Worker&quot; and &quot;Metallurgical Science&quot; for the American millionaire Charles M. Schwab meant to glorify Steel production. Schwab sent an actual steel worker to Paris to pose for the works.

==Gérôme and Impressionism==

During the last decades of his career, as his own work fell out of fashion, Gérôme was harshly critical of Impressionism. In 1894, he caused a scandal over his opposition to the Caillebotte bequest to the state which eventually became the foundation of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay collection. He organized a public demonstration in his atelier and gave interviews to reporters, including these comments published in the journal &quot;L&#x27;Éclair&quot;:

The Institut de France cannot remain still before such a scandal...How can the government dare welcome such a collection of inanities into a museum? Why, have you seen the collection? The state, the ward of such junk!... What lessons are our young artists going to receive from now on? They&#x27;ll all start to do Impressionism! Ah! these people believe they are painting nature, nature so admirable in all its manifestations! What pretension! Nature is not for them! This Monet, do you remember his cathedrals? And that man used to know how to paint! Yes, I&#x27;ve seen good things by him, but now!

Similarly he objected to the Manet memorial exhibition at the École des Beaux Arts in 1884. But he did attend the opening, after which he paid Manet the backhanded compliment that the exhibition was &quot;not so bad as I thought.&quot;

==Late career: the Pygmalion–Tanagra cycle==

Beginning in 1890, Gerome again drew inspiration from the ancient world with an interconnected, slyly self-referential series of paintings and sculptures that depicted Pygmalion and Galatea; the spirit of Tanagra; and himself.

In 1890, Gérôme made at least two paintings of the mythical Greek sculptor Pygmalion kissing his statue of Galatea at the very moment she is transformed from marble into living flesh. The most famous of these paintings titled &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; it shows the sculptor and his living statue from the rear. A variation (in private hands) shows them from the front.
Also in 1890, responding to widespread fascination with the ancient Tanagra figurines recently excavated in Greece, Gérôme sculpted the 5-foot-high, tinted-marble &quot;Tanagra&quot;, a female nude personifying the Tyche, or presiding spirit, of the ancient city. She holds on her upraised palm a figurine of a female Hoop Dancer (Gérôme&#x27;s own invention, inspired by, but not a copy of, an actual Tanagra figurine). &quot;Inspired by his characteristic desire for both archaeological accuracy and realism, Gérôme delicately tinted the skin, hair, lips, and nipples of his &quot;Tanagra&quot;, causing a sensation at the Salon of 1890.&quot;

Gérôme subsequently created smaller, gilded bronze versions of &quot;Tanagra&quot;; several versions of the &quot;Hoop Dancer&quot; figurine held by &quot;Tanagra&quot; (these became &quot;Gérôme&#x27;s most popular and widely reproduced sculpture&quot;); two paintings of an imaginary ancient Tanagra workshop where copies of his own Hoop Dancer are on display; and two self-portraits of himself sculpting &quot;Tanagra&quot; from a living model in his Paris atelier, in which a Hoop Dancer and two different versions of &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; can be seen in the background. This complex self-portrait has been called &quot;a summation of Gérôme&#x27;s remarkable career as both painter and sculptor.&quot;

Gérôme also sculpted a tinted-marble &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; (1891) based on his paintings.

In this cycle of works, with its exploration of Classical antiquity, creative inspiration, doppelgängers, and female beauty, we see Gérôme &quot;powerfully evoking the continuous interplay between painting and sculpture, reality and artifice, as well as highlighting the inherently theatrical nature of the artist&#x27;s studio.&quot;

==&quot;Truth&quot;—&quot;This is our &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;&quot;==

Beginning in the mid-1890s, in the last decade of his life, Gérôme made at least four paintings personifying Truth as a nude woman, either thrown into, at the bottom of, or emerging from a well. The imagery was inspired by an aphorism of the philosopher Democritus, &quot;Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well.&quot;

&quot;Truth Coming Out of Her Well, Armed with Her Whip to Chastise Mankind&quot; was exhibited in the &quot;Salon du Champ de Mars&quot; of 1896. It has been assumed that the painting was a comment on the Dreyfus affair, but art historian Bernard Tillier argues that Gérôme&#x27;s images of Truth and the well were part of his ongoing diatribe against Impressionism.
Gérôme himself invoked the metaphor of Truth and the well in a preface he wrote for Émile Bayard&#x27;s &quot;Le Nu Esthétique&quot;, published in 1902, to characterize the profound and irreversible influence of photography: 
Photography is an art. It forces artists to discard their old routine and forget their old formulas. It has opened our eyes and forced us to see that which previously we have not seen; a great and inexpressible service for Art. It is thanks to photography that Truth has finally come out of her well. She will never go back.

In 2012, the Anne de Beaujeu Museum in Moulins, France, which now owns the painting, mounted the exhibition &quot;La vérité est au musée&quot; (&quot;Truth is at the Museum&quot;), which collected numerous drawings, sketches, and variants made by Gérôme, and by other artists, relating to the painting and its theme. The multiple interpretations of the painting&#x27;s enigmatic meaning prompted one of the museum&#x27;s curators to say, &quot;C&#x27;est notre Joconde à nous.&quot; (&quot;This is our &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.&quot;)

==Death==

By the end of his life, Gérôme felt very much a man out of his time. In 1903, recalling his first meeting with Charles Jalabert in 1840, he wrote:At that time, Paris had nothing to do with the Paris of today: no railways, no bicycles, no cars; we were less agitated, and certain districts, among others the one we lived in and which we called the Latin Quarter, had a provincial aspect in their calm and tranquility. Now everything is changed; we no longer walk, we run like crazy; if we are not crushed during the day, we have a good chance of being murdered at night. It is charming. We have witnessed the end of a world, we are witnessing the dawn of a new one, which lacks the picturesque and above all serenity. The day is not far off when, through our customs, our ways of being, our love of the dollar (&quot;auri sacra fames&quot;), we will no longer be French, neither in spirit nor in heart. Horrible to think of! We will be Americans!

On 31 December 1903, Gérôme wrote to his student and former assistant Albert Aublet, &quot;I begin to have enough of life. I&#x27;ve seen too much misery and misfortune in the lives of others. I still see it every day, and I&#x27;m getting eager to escape this theatre.&quot; He was to live just ten more days.

On 10 January 1904, &quot;the maid found him dead in the little room next to his atelier, slumped in front of a portrait of Rembrandt and at the foot of his own painting &quot;Truth&quot;&quot;—but the source for this anecdote, the biographer Moreau-Vauthier, does not specify which painting of &quot;Truth&quot;. He was 79.

At his own request, he was given a simple burial service without flowers. But the Requiem Mass given in his memory was attended by a former president of the Republic, most prominent politicians, and many painters and writers. He was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery in front of the statue &quot;La Douleur (Pain)&quot;, which he had cast for his son Jean who had died in 1891.

==Legacy==
Gérôme&#x27;s legacy lived on through the works of his thousands of students from many countries, including: Odilon Redon, Mary Cassatt, Vasily Vasilyevich Vereshchagin, Stanisław Chlebowski, Ahmed Ali Bey, Henri-Camille Danger and Hosui Yamamoto, and many who traveled to Paris from the United States to study under him, including Thomas Eakins, Edwin Lord Weeks, and Gottardo Piazzoni.
Gérôme&#x27;s prodigious energy, long career, and wide popularity resulted in an enormous body of work that now resides in museums and private collections around the world; Ackerman&#x27;s revised &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of 2018 lists approximately 700 paintings and 70 sculptures.

In the early 1870s Gérôme was known for an astonishing range of visual exotica, all realized in precise, minute detail, achieved with thin layers of paint that revealed nary a brushstroke...His works were particularly sought after by wealthy Americans...Over the course of his career, Gérôme sold to American patrons 144 paintings, nearly a quarter of his production. [A work by Gérôme in the Nob Hill mansion of Leland Stanford was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.] Despite his prodigious output and enormous transatlantic success, most scholarly articles of recent decades cite Gérôme&#x27;s work as a noxious blend of the trite, the exploitative and the stultifying academic. However, the latest scholarship is re-evaluating Gérôme and his importance in the nineteenth century. A 2010 essay by art historian Mary G. Morton...points out that, contrary to most twenty- and twenty-first century perspectives...Americans [in the 1800s] found Gérôme&#x27;s paintings complex, edifying and completely modern.

His well-researched and minutely detailed images of gladiator combats, chariot races, slave markets, and many other subjects from the ancient world created an indelible impression on popular culture.
His ethnographic imagery of Arab and Islamic culture, controversial in his own lifetime, is now even more closely scrutinized, as is his penchant for female nudity; modern critics raise issues of &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; and &quot;sexual exploitation&quot;. These issues of sex and race were epitomized by the use in 2019 of his painting &quot;The Slave Market&quot; in an anti-Muslim campaign poster by the right wing populist party, Alternative for Germany, to the consternation of the American museum that owns the painting.

Despite charges that the Orientalizing paintings of Gérôme (and others) exploited and indulged in stereotypes of Arab and Muslim cultures, there is now &quot;a high level of interest in collecting Gérôme&#x27;s art in the Middle East,&quot; as evinced by high prices paid at auction for his work by the Qatar Museums Authority in Doha. &quot;They want to take it back and have it for themselves,&quot; says art historian Emily M. Weeks. Egyptian industrialist and art collector Shafik Gabr sees Gérôme and other Orientalist painters as &quot;intrepid early globalists who put themselves at risk to document a new world opened by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Egyptian expedition from 1798 to 1801...&#x27;I have been inspired by these painters...These people traveled under very difficult circumstances with no knowledge of what to expect. They didn&#x27;t travel to conquer or find oil. They traveled to discover and to understand.&#x27;&quot;

Gérôme&#x27;s highly vocal opposition to Impressionism was a losing argument, and his work was relegated to the margins of art history by critics, historians, and museum professionals who believed thathis chosen themes corrupted the loftier purposes of art, thus leading to commercialism...they also objected to his orientalism, which they disparaged for being untrue, a perversion or concoction of the true Orient...Now, with the exhibition at the Getty Museum, and a larger version of the show opening at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in October 2010, Gérôme is finally receiving the attention he deserves. No longer will he be lost in time, although his paintings, the way he developed them, and his relationship with many of the major issues of artistic creativity in the nineteenth century and beyond will remain controversial.

As with other painters of Classical Realism and Academic art of the 19th century, Gérôme&#x27;s prestige and popularity sharply declined in the 20th century; his painting &quot;The Snake Charmer&quot;, which sold for $19,500 in 1888, sold for $500 in 1942. Now his works are once again sought-after in the international art market. In 2008, his painting &quot;Femme circassienne voilée&quot; or &quot;Veiled Circassian Beauty&quot; (1876) was auctioned for 2,057,250 GBP; it now belongs to the Qatar Museums Authority in Doha. In 2019, his painting &quot;The Harem in the Kiosk&quot; (c. 1870–1875) realized 2,655,000 GBP at auction, and his painting &quot;Riders Crossing the Desert&quot; (1870) realized 3,135,000 GBP.

The most wide-ranging single collection of Gérôme&#x27;s work may be the several rooms dedicated to displaying his paintings and sculptures at the Musée Georges-Garret in the artist&#x27;s hometown of Vesoul. Gérôme donated several works to the museum during his lifetime, and his heirs donated more works after his death.

<text>Earl of Cromer is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, held by members of the British branch of the Anglo-German Baring banking family.

It was created in 1901 for Evelyn Baring, 1st Viscount Cromer, long time British Consul-General in Egypt. He had already been created Baron Cromer, of Cromer in the County of Norfolk, in 1892 and Viscount Cromer in 1899. At the time of his elevation to an Earl on 8 August 1901, he was also awarded the title Viscount Errington, of Hexham in Northumberland. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

The first Lord Cromer was the son of Henry Baring, third son of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, a diplomat and civil servant. His son, the third Earl, was also a diplomat and served as British Ambassador to the United States between 1971 and 1974. In 2010 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Earl, who succeeded in 1991.

Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale, was the third son of the first Earl.

The family seat is Drayton Court, near Drayton, Somerset.
