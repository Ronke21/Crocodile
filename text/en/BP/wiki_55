<text>The Canadian Football Hall of Fame (CFHOF) is a not-for-profit corporation, located in Hamilton, Ontario, that celebrates achievements in Canadian football. It is maintained by the Canadian Football League (CFL). It includes displays about the CFL, Canadian university football and Canadian junior football history.

The Hall previously had a main feature in the central portion of the museum where the metal busts of inducted members were displayed prior to the physical building being closed. There were also featured displays that highlight each CFL team&#x27;s history, and an interactive field goal kicking exhibit. The CFHOF is currently changing to a de-centralized model, which does not include a main museum building.

Once during every CFL season, the Hall sponsors the induction ceremony of former players. Included in the &quot;Hall of Fame Weekend&quot; is a regular season game, usually (but not always) affiliated with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Traditionally, the inducted players will come to the Hall and make an acceptance speech in front of the building where their newly sculpted bust is unveiled. A player must be retired from the game for at least three years before being eligible for consideration. A Hall of Fame voting committee is composed of sports writers, selected CFL executives and inducted members.

==History==
The Canadian Football Hall of Fame officially opened on November 28, 1972. The building was designed by Munro Ploen &amp; Associates of Hamilton. Originally located in downtown Hamilton, it moved to Tim Hortons Field, home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, in 2016. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame was awarded to the City of Hamilton in June 1963 following the invitation of Mayor Lloyd Douglas Jackson. The Hamilton Parks Board offered a space near Civic Stadium. In 1963, Ivan Miller, former sports editor of &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot;, was named the first curator. Soon after, the Board of Education purchased the land and building. The Hall moved to its new location in 1972 and closed on September 19, 2015. In 2015, responsibility for the museum moved from the City of Hamilton to the CFL.

The old Canadian Football Hall of Fame building was easily identified by the slightly-larger-than-life metal sculpture &quot;Touchdown&quot;, featuring a successful receiver being tackled. The sculpture has since been moved to Tim Hortons Field Gate 3. Tim Hortons Field also has 3 display areas – the Grey Cup display at Gate 3, the Media Hall of Fame Wing in the press box area, and the main display area in the premium level concourse. The main display area will feature all 296 busts (as of March 2018) and rotating displays of various artifacts. The displays are accessible during Hamilton Tiger-Cats home games (club-level display open to all ticket holders 15 minutes after the end of the game), as well as Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings to the public at no charge. The CFHOF also has travelling displays for different CFL team home fields, the Grey Cup, and other events.

<text>An underscore or underline is a line drawn under a segment of text. In proofreading, underscoring is a convention that says &quot;set this text in italic type&quot;, traditionally used on manuscript or typescript as an instruction to the printer. Its use to add emphasis in modern finished documents is generally avoided.

The (freestanding) underscore character, , also called a low line, or low dash, originally appeared on the typewriter so that underscores could be typed. To produce an underscored word, the word was typed, the typewriter carriage was moved back to the beginning of the word, and the word was overtyped with the underscore character.

In modern usage, underscoring is achieved with a markup language, with the Unicode combining low line or as a standard facility of word processing software. The free-standing underscore character is used to indicate word boundaries in situations where spaces are not allowed, such as in computer filenames, email addresses, and in Internet URLs, for example . It is also used as a proofreader&#x27;s mark, to indicate that text should be italicised when typeset, for instance is to be rendered as &quot;thus&quot;.

==Diacritic==
The combining diacritic, (macron below), is similar to the combining low line but is shorter. The difference between &quot;macron below&quot; and &quot;low line&quot; is that the latter results in an unbroken underline when it is run together: compare and (only the latter should look like abc).

==Modern use==
In a manuscript (or typescript) to be typeset, various forms of underlining (see below) were therefore conventionally used to indicate that text should be set in special type such as italics, part of a procedure known as markup. In printed documents underlining is generally avoided, with italics or small caps often used instead, or (especially in headings) using capitalization, bold type or greater body height (font size). Underlining may still be seen in display work.

A series of underscores (like __________ ) may be used to reserve a blank space in text that is later to be filled in by hand, such as on a paper form. It is also sometimes used to create a horizontal line; other symbols with similar glyphs, such as hyphens and dashes, are also used for this purpose.

In German, Slovene and some other Slavic languages, the underscore has recently gained prominence as the punctuation to form gender-neutral suffixes in gendered nouns and other parts of the speech.

The underscore is also used in modern editions of Spanish vocal sheet music to indicate elision, instead of the breve below (), which is less convenient to input on a computer.

== Mathematics ==

In mathematical notations, underscores are sometimes used in the following contexts:

* vectors. Underscores are sometimes used instead of bold face or a variable with an overarrow. E.g.: formula_1
* complex numbers. Similar to vectors, underscored variable names can indicate a complex-valued variable, especially if the real-valued variable name is reused to indicate the complex variable. For instance, in optics, formula_2 is often used for a medium&#x27;s index of refraction. When the refractive index has a wavelength-dependent extinction coefficient formula_3, the combined complex index of refraction is sometimes notated formula_4
* minimum bound. Example: formula_5 where formula_6 is the lower bound of formula_7 and formula_8 is the upper bound.

==Usage in computing==

In web browsers, default settings typically distinguish hyperlinks by underlining them (and usually changing their color), but both users and websites can change the settings to make some or all hyperlinks appear differently (or even without distinction from normal text).

===History===
As early output devices (Teleprinters, CRTs and line printers) could not produce more than one character at a location, it was not possible to underscore text, so early encodings such as ITA2 and the first versions of ASCII had no underscore. IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC character-coding system, introduced in 1964, added the underscore, which IBM referred to as the &quot;break character&quot;. IBM&#x27;s report on NPL (the early name of what is now called PL/I) leaves the character set undefined, but specifically mentions the break character, and gives as an example identifier. By 1967 the underscore had spread to ASCII, replacing the similarly shaped left-arrow character, (see also: PIP). C, developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, allowed the underscore in identifiers.

Underscore predates the existence of lower-case letters in many systems, so often it had to be used to make multi-word identifiers, since camelCase (see below) was not available.

===Programming conventions===
Underscores inserted between letters are very common to make a &quot;multi-word&quot; identifier in languages that cannot handle spaces in identifiers. This convention is known as &quot;snake case&quot; (the other popular method is called camelCase, where capital letters are used to show where the words start).

An underscore as the first character in an ID is often used to indicate an internal implementation that is not considered part of the API and should not be called by code outside that implementation. In Dart, all private properties of classes must start with an underscore; this usage is also common in other languages such as C++ even though those provide keywords to indicate that members are private. It is extensively used to hide variables and functions used for implementations in header files. In fact, the use of a single underscore for this became so common that C compilers had to standardize on a &quot;double&quot; leading underscore (for instance codice_1) for actual built-in variables to avoid conflicts with the ones in header files. PHP &quot;reserves all function names starting with __ as magical.&quot;

Python uses names that both start and end with double underscores (so called &quot;dunder methods&quot;, as in double underscore) for magic members used for purposes such as operator overloading and reflection, and names starting but not ending with a double underscore to denote private member variables of classes which should be mangled in a manner which prevents them from colliding with members of derived classes unless the classes have the same name ( in class will be mangled to ). By convention, members starting with a single underscore are considered private or protected, although this behavior only has inherent effect for modules, where statements by default import all names that do not start with an underscore, unless an export list is explicitly defined by the module.

A variable named with just an underscore often has special meaning. codice_2 or codice_3 is the previous command or result in many interactive shells, such as those of Python, Ruby, and Perl. In Perl, codice_4 is a special array variable that holds the arguments to a function. In Clojure, it indicates an argument whose value will be ignored.

In some languages with pattern matching, such as Prolog, Standard ML, Scala, OCaml, Haskell, Erlang, and the Wolfram Language, the pattern codice_3 matches any value, but does not perform binding.

===HTML &lt;u&gt; and CSS ===
The ASCII underscore character can be inserted with the entities or (or or ).

HTML has a presentational element codice_6 that was originally used to underline text; this usage was deprecated in HTML4 in favor of the CSS style codice_7. In HTML5, the tag reappeared but its meaning was changed significantly: it now &quot;represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation&quot;. This facility is intended for example to provide a red wavy line (or wiggly line) underline to flag spelling errors at input time but which are not to be embedded in any stored file (unlike an emphasis mark, which would be). Other styles are also available: doubled, dotted, and dashed.

The elements may also exist in other markup languages, such as MediaWiki. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) provides an extensive selection of related elements for marking editorial activity (insertion, deletion, correction, addition, etc.).

===Unicode===
Unicode has a free-standing underscore at U+005F, inherited from ASCII, which is a legacy of the typewriter practice of underlining using backspace and overtype. Modern practice uses the combining diacritic that results in an underline when run together: u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲. Unicode also has . In addition, there are single line and double line versions of the combining macron below, a diacritic that applies to single letters only.
===&quot;Simulated&quot; underlines in plain-text===
In plain-text applications, including plain-text e-mails where emphasis markup is not possible, the desired emphasis is often indicated by surrounding words with underscore characters. For example, &quot;You must use _emulsion_ paint on the ceiling&quot;.

Some applications will automatically add emphasis to text manually bracketed by underscores, either by underlining or by italicizing it (e.g. may render as either or &quot;string&quot;).

===As a marker for incorrectness===
Underline (typically red or wavy or both) is often used by spell checkers (and grammar checkers) to denote misspelled or otherwise incorrect text.

==Manuscripts==

Depending on local conventions, the following kinds of underlines may be used inline on manuscripts to indicate the special typefaces to be used:
*single dashed underline for , &#x27;let it stand&#x27;, proof-reading mark cancelled.
*single straight underline for &quot;italic type&quot;
*single wavy underline for bold type
*double straight underline for 
*double underline of one straight line and one wavy line for bold italic
*triple underline for FULL CAPITAL LETTERS (used among small caps or to change text already typed as lower case).

==Underlines in Chinese==
In Chinese, the underline is a little-used punctuation mark for proper names (; pinyin: zhuānmínghào; literally &quot;proper name mark&quot;, used for personal and geographic names). Its meaning is somewhat akin to capitalization in English and should never be used for emphasis even if the influence of English computing makes the latter sometimes occur. A wavy underline (; pinyin: shūmínghào; literally, &quot;book title mark&quot;) serves a similar function, but marks names of literary works instead of proper names.

In the case of two or more adjacent proper names, each individual proper name is separately underlined so there should be a slight gap between the underlining of each proper name.

<text>Bensheim () is a town in the Bergstraße district in southern Hessen, Germany. Bensheim lies on the Bergstraße and at the edge of the Odenwald mountains while at the same time having an open view over the Rhine plain. With about 40,000 inhabitants (2016), it is the district&#x27;s biggest town.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies at the eastern edge of the Rhine rift on the slopes of the western Odenwald on the Bergstraße. The nearest major cities are Darmstadt (some to the north), Heidelberg (some to the south), Worms (some to the west) and Mannheim (some to the southwest). The district seat of Heppenheim lies roughly to the south.

The Lauter flows through Bensheim, coming from the Lauter valley from the east, which after it passes through Bensheim is known as the Winkelbach. In the south of town runs the Meerbach, also coming from the Odenwald (but from the Zell valley). Mostly channelled underground and only coming above ground at the western edge of town is the &quot;Neuer Graben&quot;, or “New Channel”, which branches off the Lauter.
=== Neighbouring communities ===
Bensheim borders in the north on the town of Zwingenberg and the communities of Alsbach-Hähnlein und Seeheim-Jugenheim (both in Darmstadt-Dieburg), in the east on the community of Lautertal, in the south on the town of Heppenheim and in the west on the town of Lorsch and the community of Einhausen.

=== Constituent communities ===

Bensheim is roughly subdivided thus:
* The main town east of the railway line (old town and outskirts) with many modern town expansion developments (for example the neighbourhoods of Brunnenweg, Metzendorf, Griesel, Meerbach and Hemsberg);
* The &quot;Weststadt&quot; (“West Town”) west of the railway line (for example the neighbourhoods of Port Arthur, Marokko, Leibweh and Kappesgärten);
* The outlying centre of Auerbach to the north of the main town on the Bergstraße;
* The outlying centres of Hochstädten, Schönberg, Wilmshausen, Gronau and Zell in the nearer Odenwald valleys;
* The outlying centres of Langwaden, Fehlheim and Schwanheim in the &quot;Hessisches Ried&quot; (part of the Rhine rift in Hesse).

=== Climate ===

Bensheim is especially well known, like other places along the Bergstraße as well, for its particularly mild and sunny climate with roughly 2,000 hours of sunshine yearly and Germany&#x27;s earliest onset of spring. Under the Odenwald&#x27;s protection, kiwifruit, almonds, figs and peaches thrive here, giving the Bergstraße the nickname “Germany’s Riviera”.

The town of Bensheim fosters almond tree cultivation, to name one example, in people&#x27;s front gardens. Each year in Bensheim, there is even a &quot;Blütenkönigin&quot; (“Blossom Queen”). She is put forth every year by the Bensheim Automobile Club and for decades has been Bensheim&#x27;s hallmark both within the country and abroad.

== History ==
Bensheim has grown out of a village that had its first documentary mention in the 8th century. In the 14th century, Bensheim was granted town rights. On 26 March 1945, much of the Old Town was destroyed by incendiary bombs.

=== Settlement history ===
The South Hesse area was settled quite early on. The many finds from archaeological digs stretch back to the time of the Linear Pottery and Corded Ware cultures (roughly 2500 to 1500 BC), peoples who raised crops and livestock.

=== Middle Ages ===

In 765, &quot;Basinsheim&quot; had its first documentary mention in the Lorsch Abbey’s &quot;Codex Laureshamensis&quot;. Its founding may go back to a knight named &quot;Basinus&quot;, who received the rights to found a settlement.

The name changed from &quot;Basinsheim&quot; to &quot;Basinusheim&quot; and then to &quot;Besensheim&quot;, finally becoming Bensheim. Noteworthy is that town rights were granted early on by Emperor Otto I on 5 March 956. It can be inferred from the document text that Otto I, on the occasion of his stay in Frankfurt am Main, with his wife Adelheid’s intervention, awarded the Lorsch Abbey’s oldest market privilege. The concept, called &quot;publicae mercationes&quot; in the original, indicates the community, where public buying and selling was allowed. It still cannot be assumed that this led to a regular yearly or weekly market. Great parts of the town were destroyed in the siege of 1301 by King Albrecht I.

When Friedrich II enfeoffed the territory of the now derelict Lorsch Imperial Abbey to Archbishop Siegfried III of Eppstein, Bensheim became part of the Electorate of Mainz&#x27;s domains and likely received town rights only a few decades later, which is, however, only proved by a certificate issued in 1320.

=== Early modern times ===

In today’s outlying centres of Auerbach and Schönberg, Bensheim borders on what were the Upper County – “Upper” here refers to geography, not rank – of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen and domains of the &quot;Schenken&quot; of Erbach. When the Katzenelnbogens died out in 1479, the Landgraviate of Hesse became a neighbour to the north. In 1532, the Erbachs were raised to counts and the County of Erbach became a neighbour to the east.

In the time of the pledging to the counts palatine of the Rhine from 1461 to 1650, Bensheim experienced a boom, but as a Palatinate town, however, it was embroiled in the Bavarian-Palatine war of succession in 1504, and for eleven days was unsuccessfully besieged by the Landgrave of Hesse, who was charged with the execution of the ban of the Empire, and his confederates, the Dukes Henry of Brunswick and Henry of Mecklenburg. From this year, two yearly markets and one weekly can be established; a third yearly market came in 1619.

With the introduction of the Reformation in the Landgraviate of Hesse in 1526 and in the County of Erbach in 1544, Bensheim got not only a territorial border with these neighbours, but also a denominational one.
The Thirty Years&#x27; War put an end to all the positive developments mentioned above. On 20 November 1644, Bensheim was occupied by French and Swedish troops, who were driven out again on 2 December by Bavarian units. Later, the legend of the &quot;Fraa vun Bensem&quot; arose (the “woman from Bensheim” is said to have led the Bavarians into town through a secret route). In 1650, after just under 200 years of being pledged to the Electorate of the Palatinate, Bensheim was once again redeemed by the Archbishopric of Mainz.

=== Modern times ===
By the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803, Bensheim passed to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, who joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and was raised to Grand Duke. In 1822, there was a great fire in which 16 buildings were destroyed and 15 others were heavily damaged.

Bensheim became the seat of the &quot;Landratsbezirk&quot; (an administrative region) of Bensheim in the province of Starkenburg, which in 1832 was merged with the &quot;Landratsbezirk&quot; of Heppenheim to form the district of Bensheim (&quot;Kreis Bensheim&quot;) with Bensheim as its seat.

In 1918, the Grand Duke was removed and out of the Grand Duchy of Hesse the People&#x27;s State of Hesse was formed. On 1 November 1938, the districts of Bensheim and Heppenheim were merged into one district, Kreis Bergstraße with Heppenheim as its seat. To offset Bensheim&#x27;s loss of the status of district seat, the town got the district leadership of the Nazi Party.

During Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, the synagogue was destroyed, while the one in Auerbach survived. In 1939, Auerbach, Schönberg and Zell were amalgamated, raising the population to just under 16,500. In Auerbach, a subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof Concentration Camp was built.
On 24 March 1945, twelve people were taken to the Kirchberg (mountain) where they were murdered by the Gestapo. Two days later, on 26 March 1945, Saint George&#x27;s Parish Church, the Town Hall and parts of the Old Town were destroyed by incendiary bombs. On 27 March, the town was occupied by United States troops. As the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps agent, Henry Kissinger was the most important representative of the occupying power, after the official town commander.

In 1945, Bensheim passed to the newly formed state of Hesse.

After the Second World War ended in 1945, a displaced persons camp was established in Bensheim, first for Polish former forced labourers, later for Jewish displaced persons. The camp was dissolved in 1949.

In 1971, the population rose to some 34,000 with the amalgamation of Langwaden, Schwanheim, Fehlheim, Hochstädten, Gronau and Wilmshausen.

From 1859 to 1987 on the Nibelungenstraße towards Schönberg stood the &quot;Guntrum Bräu Bensheim&quot; brewery. In 1979, the brewery was taken over by Binding Bier Mainz, and then closed and torn down in 1987. Today, the former premises are home to a number of houses.

== Politics ==


=== Town council ===

The municipal election held on 27 March 2011 yielded the following results:

The &quot;Magistrat&quot; (roughly “town executive”) is made up of nine councillors and the mayor Rolf Richter (CDU). The two full-time councillors are Helmut Sachwitz (CDU) and Adil Oyan (Grüne Liste Bensheim). The other seats are shared among the CDU (3), the SPD (1), the Grüne Liste Bensheim (2) and the FWG (1).

=== Mayors ===
When the Municipal Order of the Grand Duchy of Hesse came into force on 30 June 1821, Bensheim citizens were allowed to choose their mayor.

* 1822–1825: Philipp Meißel
* 1825–1837: Philipp Werle
* 1837–1840: Adam Fertig
* 1840–1857: Johannes Traupel
* 1857–1859: Joseph August Hainz
* 1860–1870: Franz Heinz
* 1871–1902: Aloys van Gries
* 1902–1912: Ignaz Frenay
* 1913–1922: Karl Löslein
* 1922–1933: Rudolf Angermeier

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Gules a knight with kontos, held in both hands, and armour Or astride a steed salient argent, the whole sinister, below which a dragon statant reguardant sinister vert, the knight&#x27;s kontos thrust through it.

The German blazon says that the kontos, or lance, is golden, and that the dragon is green, although the achievement shown here, whose source is the town administration itself, shows different tinctures for these two charges.

The red field refers to the Mainz coat of arms, as the town was owned by the Bishopric of Mainz until 1802. The knight slaying the dragon represents Saint George, who was said in earlier times to have been Bensheim&#x27;s patron saint.

=== Town partnerships ===
* Beaune, Côte-d&#x27;Or, France, since 1960
* Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, since 1977
* Mohács, Baranya County, Hungary, since 1987
* Riva del Garda, Trentino, Italy, since 1989
* Kłodzko, Lower Silesia, Poland, since 1996
* Hostinné, Hradec Králové Region, Czech Republic, since 2002

Moreover, some outlying centres have their own separate partnerships.

=== Sponsorship ===
On 29 April 1956, a &quot;Patenschaft&quot; (roughly, “sponsorship”) was set up for Sudeten Germans driven out of the town of Arnau (now Hostinné in the Czech Republic) on the Elbe in the Hohenelbe district.

== Culture and sightseeing==

=== Theatre ===

The &quot;Parktheater&quot; was built in 1968 and is a linchpin in offering various cultural activities. Besides the municipal programme of plays, freelance producers, clubs and schools bring a multifaceted programme in the fields of spoken theatre, musical theatre and dance theatre. From October 1998 to December 1999, the &quot;Parktheater&quot; was optically, technologically and artistically made over from the ground up and now shines in new splendour.

Furthermore, Bensheim also has the &quot;PiPaPo Theater&quot; (cabaret), the &quot;Vornerum Theater&quot;, the &quot;Varieté Pegasus&quot; and the &quot;Autorenkollektiv Laufkundschaft&quot;.

=== Museums ===
Besides the &quot;Museum der Stadt Bensheim&quot; (municipal museum), there is also the old synagogue in Auerbach which nowadays houses a museum.

=== Music ===
The Bensheim Music School was founded in 1979. By taking part in various contests, the students at this municipal music school regularly find themselves among the prizewinners at both the state and national level. Many ensembles promote the music school&#x27;s community spirit.

=== Buildings (secular) ===
Bensheim, along with all its outlying centres has all together 557 cultural monuments. The following is a selection of the town&#x27;s most important buildings:
* &quot;Alte Faktorei&quot;, Mainz cathedral chapter&#x27;s former factory (in the sense of “commercial outpost”)
* &quot;Alte Gerberei&quot; (Old Tannery), from 1873
* &quot;Bismarckturm&quot; (tower), from 1902, on the Hemsberg (262 m)
* &quot;Dalberger Hof&quot;, former noble estate
* “&quot;Luginsland&quot;” (&quot;Blaues Türmchen&quot; or &quot;Eckturm&quot; [tower]) on the Höhenweg above Baßmannpark, built in 1910
* &quot;Hohenecker Hof&quot;, former noble estate from 1756
* &quot;Kirchberghäuschen&quot; (220 m), built in 1849, dedicated in 1857
* &quot;Metzendorf-Villen&quot; (villas)
* &quot;Rinnentorturm&quot; (tower), from the 13th or 14th century
* &quot;Rodensteiner Hof&quot;, stately home with park
* &quot;Roter Turm&quot;, watchtower from the old town wall, from the 13th century
* &quot;Walderdorffer Hof&quot;, southern Hesse&#x27;s oldest timber-frame house, built in 1395
* &quot;Wambolter Hof&quot;, former noble estate from about 1732/33

The Landgraves of Hesse once used the &quot;Fürstenlager&quot; near Bensheim-Auerbach as a spa. It is an artistic combination of simple buildings clustered like a village around the Good Well in the middle of a picturesque landscaped park. Like many territorial overlords of their day, its owners sought the peace of a rural idyll far removed from the pomp and circumstance of court.

=== Buildings (ecclesiastical) ===
* Saint George&#x27;s Parish Church (&quot;Pfarrkirche St. Georg&quot;), from 1830
* Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hospital Church (&quot;Hospitalkirche St. Joseph&quot;), from the 14th century
* Saint Crescentius&#x27;s Graveyard Church (&quot;Friedhofskirche St. Crescens&quot;), from 1618
* Saint Michael&#x27;s Church (&quot;Michaelskirche&quot;), from 1863
* Saint Lawrence&#x27;s Catholic Parish Church (&quot;Katholische Pfarrkirche St. Laurentius&quot;), from 1965

All the above churches are Catholic, except Saint Michael&#x27;s, which is Evangelical.

All 557 cultural monuments are listed in the &quot;Liste der Kulturdenkmäler in Bensheim&quot;.

=== Sport ===
Nationally known is the HSG Bensheim/Auerbach women&#x27;s handball team, which plays in the &quot;2. Handball-Bundesliga (Frauen)&quot;.

Bensheim and its outlying centres are also home to many other sport clubs.

== Denominational Institute ==
Since 1947, Bensheim has been home to the Evangelical Federation&#x27;s &quot;Konfessionskundliches Institut&quot; (“Denominational Institute”), Europe’s biggest ecumenical institute. It was housed at &quot;Wolfgang-Sucker-Haus&quot; from 1947 to 1967 and also has been once again since November 2007.

=== Youth culture ===
Bensheim has many offerings for children up to 14 years old, with, for example, a new youth centre, opened on 26 January 2006 offering ample possibilities, busying itself with this. The old, bigger youth centre on Wilhelmstraße was then closed. For youths, there is relatively little on offer. However, work has begun on the new &quot;Skate/BMX-park&quot;, on the same site where the old one was. The park was promoted and planned by youths themselves.

&quot;Bandsheim&quot; (“Band Home”) has afforded the youth music scene an outlet that regularly hosts “newcomer” concerts in Bensheim. Besides &quot;Bandsheim&quot; there is also an outlet in &quot;Party-Bensheim&quot;, which offers a venue for youths to get to know each other, have discussions and make arrangements. Both these outlets were founded by youths themselves.

Bensheim does host an “unofficial” youth club. Since the early 1980s there has been “McSlobos”, an inn that had its beginnings in the “Germania-Hof”, which has now been torn down. With many live concerts by famous local bands and the guests’ active engagement in political issues, this inn has grown into an attraction for many youths.

Nevertheless, many youths feel left out, as they must pay for all leisure activities. Hence there has also been for some time the will to create a self-administering youth centre. To this end, various action groups and campaigns have been started, such as, for example &quot;SKJuz&quot;, a “promotional club for a self-administering culture and youth centre in Bensheim”, and the action group &quot;BürgerMaiStar&quot;.

In 2010 about 50 young people from the region occupied a derelict army complex in order to establish &quot;a self-organised youth centre&quot;. However, the occupation was broken up by police several hours after it had begun.

As a follow-up to the SKJuz club the &quot;JUKUZ Bensheim e.V.&quot; was formed, which is still actively promoting the idea of a self-administered, self-organised youth centre.

== Regular events ==
The nationally known &quot;Bergsträßer Winzerfest&quot; (“Bergstraße Vintners’ Festival”) is held every first week in September throughout the inner town. The festival, which begins on the Saturday, lasts nine days. On the first Sunday there is a great festive parade, and on the second Saturday, fireworks are lit on the Kirchberg. The first &quot;Bergsträßer Winzerfest&quot; was held from 19 to 22 October 1929. Even at this first festival there were a festive parade and fireworks on the Kirchberg. Bensheim is in an area where wine grapes are grown extensively.

The &quot;Bürgerfest&quot; (“Citizens’ Festival”), which was introduced on the occasion of the opening of the pedestrian precinct in 1975, has been regularly celebrated in early summer since 1977. Great popularity is enjoyed by the &quot;Auerbacher Bachgassenfest&quot;, an outdoor gastronomical event put on by those who live on the Bachgasse (“Brook Lane”) in Auerbach, first held in 1987. Since 1986, in memory of Gertrud Eysoldt, a German actress and director, the Gertrud-Eysoldt-Ring, one of Germany&#x27;s most important theatrical prizes, has been awarded yearly.

Since 2003, the &quot;Maiway&quot; has been held every year. This is a gastronomical festival at which many pubs in Bensheim have musical groups perform.

=== Culinary specialities ===
Bensheim has &quot;Zwewwelkuche à la Fraa vun Bensem&quot; (“onion cake à la woman from Bensheim”). The first word is a local form of the German Zwiebelkuchen, and the woman is the one mentioned under &quot;History&quot; (see above).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Established businesses ===
Bensheim is part of the economically strong Rhine Neckar Area and is together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others, Heppenheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) identified as a middle centre in South Hesse regional planning.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area&#x27;s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population&#x27;s above-average buying power.

Sirona Dental Systems GmbH has its head office in Bensheim. The enterprise is the district&#x27;s biggest employer and produces goods and services for dentists. Kern GmbH manufactures enveloping systems for banks, insurance companies, telecommunications businesses and information technology service providers and is also headquartered in Bensheim. Offering services to pharmaceutical businesses is Cegedim Deutschland GmbH, which also has its head office in Bensheim. Furthermore, there are the electronics firm Tyco Electronics AMP GmbH, SAP AG, which is active in the information technology field, the &quot;Institut für Organisationskommunikation&quot; (IFOK) and HTV GmbH, which tests and programs semiconductors for manufacturers from almost all fields of electronics. Also, the auto manufacturer Suzuki International Europe GmbH is headquartered in Bensheim. The cars in the company&#x27;s national television advertising bear registrations beginning with “HP” (Heppenheim/Kreis Bergstraße) for this reason, which is seldom otherwise seen in this context. Deutsche Papier Vertriebs GmbH, which belongs to PaperlinX, runs, as a nationally active paper wholesaler, one of Germany&#x27;s most modern high-bay warehouses. GGEW, a service-providing business for electricity, natural gas and drinking water, has its head office in Bensheim.

=== Media ===
Local happenings are reported in Bensheim and the surrounding area are reported by the &quot;Bergsträßer Anzeiger&quot;, a newspaper belonging to the Mannheimer Morgen publishing group. The paper&#x27;s address is Rodensteinstraße 6 and it is published from Monday to Saturday.

=== Transport ===
Bensheim lies at the crossroads of federal highways B 3 and B 47. Through the town&#x27;s west end runs Autobahn A 5, from which Bensheim can be reached by two exits: in the north the Zwingenberg – Bensheim-Auerbach exit, and in the south the Bensheim exit. A few kilometres farther west, running parallel to the A 5, is the A 67, when Bensheim can be reached through the Lorsch exit.

From Bensheim station, the town is linked to the German InterCity network by the Frankfurt am Main–Heidelberg line. The station is also the end of the Nibelungen Railway from Worms to Bensheim. The outlying centre of Auerbach has its own station, Bensheim-Auerbach, on the Frankfurt-Heidelberg line, but only Regionalbahn trains stop there.

Frankfurt Airport lies just under away by road, north of Bensheim. There is a gliderport at Bensheim for gliders, motor gliders and other, smaller aircraft, managed by a nonprofit gliding club (SFG Bensheim).

=== Education ===
Bensheim is a school town, with five Gymnasien: the &quot;Altes Kurfürstliches Gymnasium&quot;, the &quot;Geschwister-Scholl-Schule&quot; (coöperative comprehensive school with Gymnasium upper level), the &quot;Goethe-Gymnasium Bensheim&quot; (Gymnasium from class 5 with Gymnasium upper level), the &quot;Karl-Kübel-Schule&quot; (commercial schools with Gymnasium for economics, technology and health) and the &quot;Liebfrauenschule&quot; (private Catholic Gymnasium for girls). The town also has the &quot;Schillerschule&quot;, which is a primary school, Hauptschule and Realschule.

Offering adult education are the &quot;Volkshochschule Bensheim&quot; and the &quot;Frauen- und Familienzentrum Bensheim&quot;, with about 2,000 participants each year the biggest family meeting place in Kreis Bergstraße.

<text>The Ford Fiesta is a supermini car that was marketed by Ford from 1976 to 2023 over seven generations. Over the years, the Fiesta has mainly been developed and manufactured by Ford&#x27;s European operations, and had been positioned below the Escort (later the Focus).

Ford had sold over 15 million Fiestas from 1976 to July 2011, making it one of the best-selling Ford nameplates behind the Escort and the F-Series. It has been manufactured in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico, Taiwan, China, India, Thailand, and South Africa.

The Fiesta was discontinued in 2023, after over 22 million units had been made. The final Ford Fiesta rolled off the production line on 7 July 2023.

The Fiesta was originally designed by the project &quot;Bobcat&quot; team headed by Trevor Erskine (not to be confused with the badge-engineered Mercury variant of the Ford Pinto) and approved for development by Henry Ford II in September 1972, shortly after the launch of two comparable cars – the Fiat 127 and Renault 5. More than a decade earlier, Ford had decided against producing a new small car to rival BMC&#x27;s Mini, as the production cost was deemed too high, but the 1973 oil crisis caused a rise in the already growing demand for smaller cars, and the runaway success of the Fiat 127 and Renault 5 was what ultimately convinced Ford to enter the B-segment. In Europe, Ford&#x27;s arch rival General Motors attempted to address the market need by developing a small hatchback version of its &quot;T-car&quot;, which emerged as the 1975 Opel Kadett City and Vauxhall Chevette, but being rear wheel drive, these were not true &quot;superminis&quot; in that they could not deliver the required space efficiency that a transverse engined, front wheel drive package could achieve, this therefore would be template followed by the Fiesta.

The Fiesta was an all new car in the supermini segment, and was the smallest car yet made by Ford. Development targets indicated a production cost US$100 less than the current Escort. The car was to have a wheelbase longer than that of the Fiat 127, but with overall length shorter than that of Ford&#x27;s Escort. The final proposal was developed by Tom Tjaarda at Ghia, overseen by Ford of Europe&#x27;s then chief stylist Uwe Bahnsen. The project was approved for production in late 1973, with Ford&#x27;s engineering centres in Cologne and Dunton (Essex) collaborating.

Ford estimated that 500,000 Fiestas a year would be produced, and built a new factory near Valencia, Spain; factory extensions for the assembly plants in Dagenham, UK. Final assembly also took place in Valencia. As the Fiesta would be Ford&#x27;s first transverse engined car, a new transaxle was required and a factory near Bordeaux, France was built for this purpose. Since it was known by 1975 that this transmission unit would also be used in the larger Escort when it switched to front wheel drive for its third generation in 1980, enough upward capacity was built into the Bordeaux plant to meet this need.

After years of speculation by the motoring press about Ford&#x27;s new car, it was subject to a succession of carefully crafted press leaks from the end of 1975. A Fiesta was on display at the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in June 1976, and the car went on sale in France and Germany in September 1976; to the frustration of UK dealerships, right-hand drive versions only began to appear in January 1977. Its initial competitors in Europe, apart from the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, included the Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Chevette. Chrysler UK were also about to launch the Sunbeam by this stage, and British Leyland was working on a new supermini, which was launched as the Austin Metro in 1980.

The name &quot;Fiesta&quot; (meaning &quot;party&quot; in Spanish) belonged to General Motors when the car was designed, used as a trim level on Oldsmobile station wagons, and was freely given for Ford to use on their new B-class car. Ford&#x27;s marketing team had preferred the name &quot;Bravo&quot;, but Henry Ford II chose &quot;Fiesta&quot;. Ford did end up using the &quot;Bravo&quot; name on a limited edition of the Fiesta Mark I in the early 1980s.

==First generation (1976)==


The Fiesta was initially available in Europe with the Valencia Straight-four engine (I4) with high- and low-compression options, and engines and in Base, Popular, Popular Plus, L, GL (1978 onward), Ghia, and S trim levels, as well as a van. The US Mark I Fiesta was built in Cologne, but to slightly different specifications; US models were Base, Decor, Sport, and Ghia, with the Ghia having the highest level of trim. These trim levels changed very little in the Fiesta&#x27;s three-year run in the US, from 1978 to 1980. All US models featured the more powerful engine, which was the older &quot;Crossflow&quot; version of the Kent rather than the Valencia, fitted with a catalytic converter and air pump to satisfy strict emission regulations, energy-absorbing bumpers, side-marker lamps, round sealed-beam headlamps, and improved crash dynamics and fuel system integrity, as well as optional air conditioning (which was not available in Europe). In the US market, the North American Ford Escort replaced both the Fiesta and the compact Pinto in 1981.

A sporting derivative (1.3 L Supersport) was offered in Europe for the 1980 model year, using the Kent Crossflow engine, effectively to test the market for the similar XR2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6-litre version of the same engine. Black plastic trim was added to the exterior and interior. The small, square headlights were replaced with larger circular ones, with the front indicators being moved into the bumper to accommodate the change.

Minor revisions appeared across the range in late 1981, with larger bumpers to meet crash-worthiness regulations and other small improvements in a bid to maintain showroom appeal ahead of the forthcoming second generation.
==Second generation (1983)==


The Fiesta Mark II appeared in August 1983 with a revised front end and interior, and a bootlid mirroring the swage lines from the sides of the car. The 1.3 L OHV engine was dropped, being replaced in 1984 by a compound valve-angle hemispherical combustion chamber (CVH) powerplant of similar capacity, itself superseded by the lean burn 1.4 L two years later. The 957 and 1,117 cc Kent/Valencia engines continued with only slight alterations and for the first time a Fiesta diesel was produced with a 1,600 cc engine adapted from the Escort.

The new CTX continuously variable transmission, also fitted in the Fiat Uno, eventually appeared early in 1987 on 1.1 L models only.

The Mk2 Fiesta core range (excluding special editions) was made up of these model variants; Popular, Popular Plus, L, Ghia, 1.4S (1986 onwards), and finally, the XR2.
The second-generation Fiesta featured a different dashboard on the lower-series trim levels compared to the more expensive variants.
The XR2 model was thoroughly updated with a larger body kit. It also featured a 1.6 L CVH engine as previously seen in the Ford Escort XR3, and five-speed gearbox (also standard on the 1.3 L CVH models), rather than the four-speed gearbox, which had been used on the previous XR2 and on the rest of the Fiesta range. The engine was replaced by a lean-burn variant in 1986, which featured a revised cylinder head and carburettor; it was significantly cleaner from an environmental viewpoint, but was slightly less powerful as a result ().

A truly &quot;hot&quot; Fiesta was never produced by the factory to avoid impacting sales of performance Ford Escort variants, but many aftermarket conversions were available, such as that by the English firm Turbo Technics boosting power to . Ford appreciated the high quality of this conversion, and was keen to look after its customers; the installation was undertaken by approved fitting centres and all the warranties remained valid after.

The facelifted Fiesta, facing competition from the Austin Metro, Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra, Peugeot 205, Toyota Starlet, Vauxhall Nova, and Volkswagen Polo, was one of the UK&#x27;s top superminis. In its best-ever year, 1987, over 150,000 Fiesta models were sold in the UK, though it finished second in the sales charts to the Ford Escort. It was available in Japan, sold at Ford/Mazda dealerships called &quot;Autorama&quot;; it complied with Japanese government dimension regulations, and the engine displacement was in the more favourable Japanese road tax bracket, which helped sales.
==Third generation (BE13; 1989)==

The third-generation Fiesta Mark III, codenamed &quot;BE-13&quot;, was unveiled at the end of 1988 and officially went on sale in February 1989. The car was based on a new platform, ditching the old car&#x27;s rear beam axle for a semi-independent torsion beam arrangement, and looked radically different, addressing the principal weakness of the previous generation – the lack of a five-door version, which was by then available in its major rivals such as the Fiat Uno, Peugeot 205 and 106, and Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova. The other main change was to the running gear – the improved high-compression swirl version of the Kent/Valencia powerplant. The CVH units from the second generation were carried over largely unmodified. The diesel engine was enlarged to a 1.8 L capacity.

The first sports model was the 1.6S CVH 90BHP which had a twin choke Weber carburettor with no CAT and was still on sale until August 1991. It was replaced by the fuel injection XR2i.

The sports-model XR2i was launched in August 1989 with an eight-valve CVH engine with . This was the first Fiesta to have a fuel-injected engine. This was then replaced by a Zetec 16-valve version in 1992, which also had the RS Turbo being supplanted by the RS1800, as the CVH engine was being phased out. The RS1800 shared its 1.8-litre Zetec fuel-injected engine with the version of the then-current Ford Escort XR3i, and had a top speed of . The XR2i name was also dropped in early 1994, and the insurance-friendly &quot;Si&quot; badge appeared in its place on a slightly less sporty-looking model with either the 1.4 L PTE (a development of the CVH) or the 1.6 L Zetec engine.

With the introduction of the successor Mark IV, the Mark III was built and sold at the same time. To distinguish the car, trim levels were revised, and it was marketed as the &quot;Fiesta Classic&quot;. This version continued until production finally ceased in 1997.
==Fourth generation (BE91; 1995)==


The Fiesta Mark IV (internal code name was &quot;BE91&quot;) was launched in October 1995 and became Britain&#x27;s best-selling car from 1996 to 1998, when it was overtaken by the all-new Ford Focus, a replacement for the Escort.

The Mark IV benefited from new interior and exterior styling. It maintained similar dimensions to the Mark III, along with the platform and the basic body structure, most noticeably the side door openings. The RS1800 and RS Turbo models were not carried over to the updated Fiesta range.

The model featured a range of new Zetec-SE engines, available in 1.25 L and 1.4 L forms, the 1.8-litre Diesel engine was slightly modified for the Mark IV, now marketed as the &quot;Endura DE&quot;. Lower-specification models remained available with what was the final edition of the Kent 1.3 L OHV engine, now known as Endura-E.

As an exercise in badge engineering, the Mazda 121 and Ford Fiesta Mark IV shared their design, were built on the same production lines, and used almost all the same parts. In the JD Power reliability surveys at the time, the Mazda was reported to be significantly more reliable and attracted higher levels of customer satisfaction, despite it being a slower seller than the Fiesta.

==Fifth generation (BE256; 2002)==

On 1 April 2002, the Fiesta Mark V was unveiled. This generation of the Ford Fiesta (Mk5) is often referred to as Mk6. This is because the previous model, the Mk4 Fiesta, was often called the Mk5 after it received a facelift in late 1999. In other words, the 2002–2008 Fiesta is the fifth generation model and what is often referred to as Mk5 is just a facelift model of the Mk4 – different looking front but still the same car. Production at Almussafes Plant started on 29 April 2002. Most engines were carried over from the previous Fiesta, but renamed &quot;Duratec&quot;, as the &quot;Zetec&quot; name was now solely used for sportier models. The previous push-rod 1.3 L engine was initially available in the UK, but this was quickly replaced with a Rocam 1.3 L, both under the name Duratec 8v.

Trim levels available initially were Finesse, LX, Zetec, and Ghia, with limited-edition variants soon following. The fifth generation was also the first Fiesta to feature the antilock braking system and passenger airbags as standard. This generation became the best-selling Ford Fiesta generation to date.

Engines available include 1.25, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, and 2.0 L petrol engines, plus 1.4 L 8v and 1.6 L 16v Duratorq TDCi common-rail diesels built in a joint venture with PSA. There was also a Supercharged 1.0 L in the Brazilian market.

This was the first Fiesta to be sold in Asia and Australasia (all 1.6 L LX three-door/five-door, Zetec three-door, Ghia five-door), replacing the Kia-based Festiva. In Brazil and Argentina, a Fiesta saloon version was introduced in late 2004. A similar Fiesta saloon model, with a different front end, was released in India in late 2005. This Fiesta generation was ergonomically and mechanically more advanced than any previous generation. The 2005 facelift came with an improved exterior.

== Sixth generation (B299/B409; 2008) ==

The sixth-generation Fiesta, also known as Mark VI or Mark VII in the UK, was shown in concept form as the Ford Verve at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007, and marketed in principal European markets, Australia and the United States. Developed under the project code B299 and B409, this model uses the new Ford global B-car platform.

The model was launched under the company&#x27;s new &quot;One Ford&quot; strategy, which called for single models to be manufactured and sold globally to achieve efficiency and economies of scale, instead of making regional models. Production started at Ford&#x27;s Cologne plant in Germany in August 2008. A second plant in Valencia, Spain, started production in early 2009. Production in China, Thailand, and Mexico started from late 2008 to 2010. In Brazil, the production of the hatchback version started in 2013. The production of the Ford Fiesta was discontinued in Brazil in June 2019, after being present in the market for 24 years.

In late September 2012 at the Paris Motor Show, the facelifted Fiesta for the European market went on sale in 2013. It was the first to use Ford&#x27;s latest corporate front end, which included the newly introduced trapezoidal grille.

==Seventh generation (B479; 2017)==

On 29 November 2016, the seventh-generation Fiesta (Mark VII, or Mark VIII in UK) was announced in Germany. It is said to be larger, roomier, safer, more efficient, and more upmarket compared to its predecessor. The Fiesta range expanded to include new additions – a crossover-styled variant called the Fiesta Active, and the luxury Fiesta Vignale.

The model was not sold in the Americas, Asia or Oceania, as Ford decided to prioritise crossover SUVs, pickup trucks and sports cars. However, the Fiesta ST continued to be sold in Australia due to its popularity and larger profit margin.


==Commercial variants==
All seven generations of the Fiesta have been available in sedan delivery/panel van format, although not in all markets. The Mark I, II, and III versions feature the standard three-door bodyshell with the rear side glass replaced by body-coloured metal and a flat floor pan instead of the rear seats.

In 1991, a &quot;high-cube&quot;-style van based on the Mark III front bodyshell, but with longer wheelbase and Renault-derived rear torsion bar suspension, was introduced and was named the Ford Courier. The Courier continued in the Mark IV style through 2002, when it was replaced by the Ford Transit Connect.

For the Mark V, the standard Fiesta van version was based on the three-door bodyshell rather than the taller five-door version. The Mark VI Fiesta van was first introduced in the European market in mid-2009, a year after the original launch.

==Motorsport==

===Rallying===

Two Ford Fiestas were entered in the 1979 Monte Carlo Rally — the British entry driven by Roger Clark and aided by co-driver Jim Porter, and a German entry piloted by Ari Vatanen and co-driven by David Richards. Both cars were highly modified with special motorsport components throughout and featured pioneering limited-slip differential technology. The cars were powered by competition tuned versions of the 1,600 cc Kent crossflow engine – a later version of which appeared in the Mk 1 Fiesta XR2. The two rally cars performed well in the arduous ice and snow that year. Roger Clark did not set any records but the German car achieved 9th position overall – a very encouraging result, which sparked demand for sportier Fiestas.

Since this, sporting and &quot;hot hatch&quot; editions have been introduced, including Supersport, XR2, S(Sport), XR2i, Si, RS Turbo, RS1800, Zetec S, Zetec RS, and ST. All of these were powered by a range of engines from the Ford Kent to the Ford Duratec engines.

The Ford RallyeConcept in 2002 has been realised through an intensely close collaboration between Ford RallyeSport, the motorsport experts behind the Puma Super 1600 and the Focus WRC rally cars, and Ford Design Europe, the creative team responsible for the new three-door Fiesta on which the RallyeConcept is based. Ford RallyeConcept&#x27;s marriage of the motorsport engineer&#x27;s objective for performance functionality with the eye for detail of the designer has been so effective that Ford has committed to an engineering development programme to bring a Fiesta-based rally car to reality. Aiming for FIA homologation by mid-2003, Ford RallyeSport is hoping that it will become Ford&#x27;s next success story in national and international rallying. The Fiesta Super 1600 debuted at Rally Greece 2004.

The &quot;Fiesta Sporting Trophy&quot; is a &quot;One Make&quot; Championship; beginning its first season in March 2006, it combines keen competition with equal performance and leaves the decision about winning or losing to the drivers and co-drivers&#x27; capabilities. The driver, co-driver, and mechanics work as a team to compete against the toughest adversary of all—the clock.

The Fiesta Sporting Trophy is based around the Fiesta ST Group N car. The car has from the 2 L Duratec ST engine, which when combined with the conversion kit from M-Sport, has been designed to provide all of the safety equipment and performance upgrades to enable the car to be competitive and reliable at any event around the world.

In March 2007, the Pirtek Rally Team introduced the Ford Fiesta Super 2000 rally car, which was to compete in the Australian Rally Championship.

On 18 November 2009, Ford with M-Sport unveiled the Ford Fiesta S2000 Mark VI. Although not due for homologation until January 2010, it was set to make its debut as course car on the final round of the IRC series, Rally Scotland. The car had been built to compete mainly in the Super 2000 World Rally Championship. In 2013, M-Sport developed the Ford Fiesta R5, the successor of the Fiesta S2000; this was based on the 1.6-litre Fiesta ST, and was designed for the Group R5 class of rallying. Fiesta R5 got Evo update in early 2016.
With new WRC regulations coming in 2011, M-Sport developed the Fiesta RS WRC, based on Fiesta S2000. It won six WRC rounds in 2011 and 2012, driven by Jari-Matti Latvala, Mikko Hirvonen and Mads Ostberg, but since M-Sport lost most of its manufacturer support for the 2013 season the car hasn&#x27;t been able to win. In 2013, Thierry Neuville was the world championship runner-up, being a M-Sport junior works driver. Fiesta RS WRC has been very popular among private drivers, due to its good driveability, reasonable price and good availability.

The WRC regulations will be altered for 2017 and M-Sport has thus started developing the Mk7 Fiesta World Rally Car.




====Fiesta ST Group N specifications====

===Rallycross===
The Fiesta Rallycross Supercars version is a racecar with a 2.0 L Duratec turbocharged four-cylinder engine, running on petrol or E85 (85% ethanol/15% petrol). It produces over and . That propels the rallycross-prepped Fiesta up to sixty in 2.2 seconds. The cars were more powerful (another 200 bhp) than WRC cars.

The Fiesta Mk6 Rallycross cars made their US debuts in the 2009 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado. Swedish team Olsbergs MSE announced the cars would later appear in ESPN&#x27;s X Games 15 on 2009-08-02. The two Olsbergs MSE Fiesta Mk7 Rallycross cars were based on the Fiesta hatchback model road cars, one with 3 doors, the other one a 5-doors version, but with all-wheel drive, powered by 2.0 L Duratec Ford engines capable of more than (for PPIHC only).

British company M-Sport also builds Fiesta Rallycross Supercars to Global Rallycross Championship teams Hoonigan Racing Division, Chip Ganassi Racing and Bryan Herta Autosport.

Driving a Fiesta, Tanner Foust won the 2011 and 2012 Global RallyCross Championship and was runner-up in the 2011 and 2012 FIA European Rallycross Championship. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2013 and Joni Wiman in 2014. Other notable drivers include Marcus Grönholm, Ken Block and Brian Deegan.

An Olsbergs MSE RX Supercar Lite from FIA Rallycross Lite is also based on Ford FIesta.

===Circuit racing===
In the UK, the Fiesta is commonly used in club level motorsport series but has its national one-make series called the &quot;Ford Fiesta Championship&quot;. During its peak in the 1980s and 1990s, it had manufacturer support and it even was a support race to the British Grand Prix and numerous British Touring Car Championship rounds. The series has gone through numerous name changes including &quot;Ford Credit Fiesta Championship&quot;, &quot;Ford Fiesta Zetec Championship&quot; and &quot;BRSCC Ford Si Challenge&quot; and is nowadays run by the BRSCC (British Racing and Sports Car Club) as a club racing championship. The organisation also run the other series that consists of Fiestas.
* &quot;Ford XR Challenge&quot;, for XR2 and XR2i models, also consists of the Escort XR models.
* &quot;Ford Saloon Championship&quot;, mainly for a wider range of Ford models but Fiestas are mostly seen in classes C and E with a Mk 4 example winning the title outright in 2006 at the hands of Ollie Allen.
The car has also been raced in the Touring-Light division of the Russian Touring Car Championship.

Fiesta drivers won the Super 1600 class of the European Touring Car Cup seven times from 2008 to 2016.

==Sales and popularity==
The Fiesta has been Britain&#x27;s most popular new car in 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997, 1998 and each year from 2009 to 2020, by the time of the MK2 Fiesta&#x27;s demise in early 1989, just under 1,300,000 had been sold in Britain since its launch 12 years earlier, In June 2014 Ford claimed the largest market share in the UK, of 12.87% – and almost half of those registrations belonged to the Fiesta. By July 2014, the Fiesta became the UK&#x27;s best-selling car of all time, with 4,115,000 sold.
==Awards and recognition==

The 2011 Fiesta was one of the five finalists for the 2011 Green Car of the Year awarded by the Green Car Journal in November 2010, competing with two plug-in electric vehicles, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt (the winner), and two hybrid electric vehicles.

== Discontinuation ==
In October 2022, Ford executives announced the discontinuation of the Ford Fiesta, as costs of parts increase and drivers opt for SUVs. This will also allow the company to focus on electrifying its lineup. The last Ford Fiesta left the production line in Cologne, Germany, on 7 July 2023. The final two Ford Fiestas will be kept by Ford, one will join Ford&#x27;s international heritage fleet, and another Fiesta will join Ford&#x27;s UK heritage fleet.

<text>Louis-Jodel Chamblain (born January 18, 1953 or 1954) is a prominent Haitian military figure who has led both government troops and rebels.

Chamblain first emerged as a notorious figure as a sergeant within the transitional military junta running Haïti following the collapse of Jean-Claude Duvalier&#x27;s dictatorship in 1986. In 1987, Chamblain allegedly headed government death squads that attacked voters at the 1987 presidential election, causing it to be cancelled; the election was to permit transition to civilian rule.

Civilian elections did take place in 1990 (Haitian general election, 1990–1991), in which Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected, but the 1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état, in which Chamblain was involved, overthrew Aristide just eight months later. Immediately following the coup, Chamblain&#x27;s reputation for brutality grew further as he is reported to have been responsible for thousands of murders of Aristide followers.

Chamblain was second-in-command of a paramilitary organization, the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), founded in August 1993 as tensions grew between supporters of Aristide&#x27;s reinstatement and supporters of the military government. With the end of the military regime and restoration of Aristide (following the U.S. Operation Uphold Democracy intervention) in 1994, Chamblain went into exile in the Dominican Republic. He was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for his involvement in the murder of Antoine Izméry, a well-known pro-democracy activist, and for his involvement in the Raboteau Massacre.

In February 2004, Chamblain returned from exile to take part in a new rebellion against Aristide. Shortly after his return, he captured the central city of Hinche from the Haitian police with a force of 50 men.

Following Chamblain&#x27;s return and the collapse of Aristide&#x27;s government in 2004, Amnesty International called for UN peacekeepers to arrest Chamblain for his alleged participation in various war crimes in 1987, 1991, and 1993-1994. In April 2004, he turned himself in to face a retrial in the case of Izméry&#x27;s murder and was acquitted; he was eventually released from prison in August 2005.

Chamberlain appeared together with Jean-Claude Duvalier as his chief-of-security on Duvalier&#x27;s return from exile on 16 January 2011.

<doc id="477091" wikidata="Q993851" url="?curid=477091" title="Hinche">
<text>Hinche (; ; ) is a commune in the Centre department of Haiti. It has a population of about 50,000. It is the capital of the Centre department. Hinche is the hometown of Charlemagne Péralte, the Haitian nationalist leader who resisted the United States occupation of Haiti that lasted between 1915–1934.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===

The island of Hispaniola was discovered by the navigator Christopher Columbus in 1492. The original population of the island, the Tainos, were gradually destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors.

The village of Hincha was founded in 1704, by Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands.

In 1739 its population was about 500, which by 1760 had grown to 3,092 people, of whom 1,443 were slaves. By 1783 its population had dropped to 2,993, due to the founding of San Rafael de La Angostura and San Miguel de la Atalaya in the Central Plateau, which along with San Francisco de Bánica and Dajabón had 18,000 inhabitants, representing 14% of the colony&#x27;s population.

Its economy primarily focused on exporting beef to the incipient French colony of Saint-Domingue, where the meat was 750% more expensive. In 1743 it had 19,335 livestock (the second largest in the Spanish colony), and in 1772 the number of livestock rose to 30,000 head, the largest one in the colony.

In 1776, the governors of Saint-Domingue and Santo Domingo agreed in San Miguel de la Atalaya to the creation of a joint commission that would draw the border between the two colonies. The following year, Spain and France signed the Treaty of Aranjuez (1777), and the border between the Spanish and French colonies was plotted.

Hincha was the scene of armed conflict during the War of the First Coalition. At the end of this war, under the Peace of Basel, Spain was to yield to France all rights over Hispaniola in exchange for the regions of the Basque Country, Navarre, Catalonia and Valencia, occupied by France during the war. However France did not take possession of the Spanish colony under the treaty until 1802. In 1801, amid the Haitian Revolution, Toussaint Louverture captured Santo Domingo and proclaimed the emancipation of the slaves. The next year, Napoleon Bonaparte sent an army commanded by his brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc, who captured L’Ouverture and sent him to France as prisoner. In 1809, during the course of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain regained its former possessions on the island and slavery was restored.

=== From 1821 to 1937 ===

On 1 December 1821 it was declared in Santo Domingo the independence of the Republic of Spanish Haiti by José Núñez de Cáceres. After this Jean Pierre Boyer invaded the Spanish side of the island. Haiti ruled this whole island for 22 years. In 1844 the former Spanish Haiti declared its independence and became the Dominican Republic.

Neighboring towns and cities like Hincha (now &quot;Hinche&quot;), Juana Méndez (now &quot;Ouanaminthe&quot;), San Rafael de La Angostura (now &quot;Saint-Raphaël&quot;), San Miguel de la Atalaya (now &quot;Saint-Michel-de-l’Atalaye&quot;), or Las Caobas (now &quot;Lascahobas&quot;), among others, remained isolated with little communication with the Dominican capital whilst there were a growing Haitian influence as the gourde circulated and in addition to the Spanish language, Haitian Creole was also spoken. Eventually these cities would be disputed between the two countries.
Hinche is the native town of Pedro Santana, first President of the Dominican Republic, as well of José de Guzmán, 1st Viscount of San Rafael de la Angostura, and Charlemagne Péralte, Haitian nationalist leader of Dominican origin who resisted the occupation of Haiti by the United States (1915–1934).

=== Recent history ===

On 18 March 2016, at least 7 people were killed and 30 injured in Henche when a fuel truck exploded while delivering fuel to a Total station in the city. Four homes and 22 vehicles were also destroyed in the accident.

==Culture==
The official religion is Roman Catholicism, but the constitution allows the free choice of religion. There are also many non-Catholic Christian churches in the city and the surrounding communities. Groups, like the Haiti Endowment Fund (HEF) of Southern California send medical missionaries several times a year to provide medicines and basic healthcare. HEF has also helped build community churches. Some of the people also practice vodou.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine is Créole, French, or a mixture of both. Créole cuisine is like other Caribbean cuisines, but more peppery. Specialties include griot (deep-fried pieces of pork), lambi (conch, considered an aphrodisiac), tassot (jerked beef) and rice with djon-djon (tiny, dark mushrooms). As elsewhere in the Caribbean, lobster is well known here. A wide range of microclimates produces a large assortment of fruits and vegetables. Vegetarians will have a difficult time here, because pig fat is often used in food preparation, so even beans are to be avoided.

The people enjoy a strong, sweet coffee—Rebo is one brand. The Barbancourt rum is also popular.

Interesting cuisine-related features of Hinche, include a market and the &quot;Foyer d’Accueil&quot;, an unmarked guesthouse above a school that is behind a blue and white church on the eastside of the main square.

===Post-earthquake difficulties ===

In the wake of 12 January 2010, while no casualties or serious damage were reported in Hinche, thousands of refugees began pouring into the town.

===Attractions===

Hinche can be accessed by road or plane. It has one of the major Haitian airports which has a dirt runway that will allow a small Cessna and single engine planes to land. Usually, these flights are chartered from Port-au-Prince. Mission Aviation Fellowship offers charter flights to Hinche. East of Hinche, Bassin Zim is a 20 m waterfall in a lush setting, a 30-minute drive from town. In the city you will also find the Cathédrale de Sacré-Coeur.

==Transportation==

Route Nationale 3, the 128-km semi-dirt road northeast from Port-au-Prince to Hinche requires a four-wheel drive and takes at least two hours (much longer by public transport). 100 percent of this road is now paved. It starts by crossing the Cul-de-Sac plain via Croix-des-Bouquets. Here, Route Nationale 8, a newly improved road, branches off southeast through a parched, barren region, skirting Lake Saumâtre before reaching the Dominican border at Malpasse. Mission Aviation Fellowship charters flights to the airport in town Hinche Airport. Before a flight comes in livestock and people must be cleared from the airstrip. The airport is located right near center city and right across the street is the hospital. The RN3 heads north out of Mirebalais on to the Central Plateau, where the military crackdown was especially harsh after the 1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état because peasant movements had been pressing for change here for years. After skirting the Peligre Hydroelectric Dam, now silted up and almost useless, the road passes Thomonde and reaches this city.

<text>Seeheim-Jugenheim is a municipality in the Darmstadt-Dieburg district in Hesse, Germany. It has a population of approximately 17,000.

Seeheim-Jugenheim consists of seven villages:

*Balkhausen (population 693)

*Ober-Beerbach (population 1,269)
*Seeheim (population 9,060)
*Steigerts (population 81)
*Stettbach (population 144)

The municipality was formed on 1 January 1977 through the unification of the previously separate municipalities of Seeheim and Jugenheim. Until 1 January 1978 the municipality was known as Seeheim; after that it became known as Seeheim-Jugenheim.

It is known for its mountain bike trails to the nearby mountain Melibokus.

Seeheim-Jugenheim has been home to several notable residents throughout history, including Tsar Nicholas II of Russia as well as writers Georg Kaiser and Helene Christaller.

Further it has been an ancient Jewish Community.

Industrial and commercial activity in Seeheim-Jugenheim is close to nonexistent; thus, most of its residents work in the nearby cities of Darmstadt, Frankfurt or Heidelberg.

The local football team is called Spielvereiningung Seeheim Jugenheim.

<text>50 First Dates is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Peter Segal and starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, with Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Lusia Strus, Blake Clark, and Dan Aykroyd in supporting roles. It follows the story of Henry Roth, a womanizing marine veterinarian who falls for an art teacher named Lucy Whitmore. When he discovers she has amnesia, and forgets him when she falls asleep, he resolves to win her over again each new day.

Most of the film was shot on location in Oahu, Hawaii, on the Windward side and the North Shore. Sandler and Barrymore won an MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Team.

The film received mixed reviews but was a commercial success. It was later remade in India as &quot;Satyabhama&quot; (2007, in Telugu) and as &quot;Ormayundo Ee Mukham&quot; (2014, in Malayalam), in Japan as &quot;50 First Kisses&quot; (2018), in Iran as &quot;Chap dast&quot; (2005), and in Mexico as &quot;Como si fuera la primera vez&quot; (2019). The film marked the second collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, after &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; and before &quot;Blended&quot; (both directed by Frank Coraci). During the end credits, it featured a dedication to the memory of Sandler&#x27;s father Stanley, who had died at the age of 68 from lung cancer on September 9, 2003.

==Plot==
Henry Roth, a marine veterinarian at Sea Life Park Hawaii on Oahu, only dates tourists to avoid any serious commitments. His closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; Alexa, his androgynous assistant; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus that lives at the park.

One day, Henry&#x27;s boat breaks down, and while waiting for the Coast Guard at the Hukilau Café, he encounters art teacher Lucy Whitmore constructing architectural art with her waffles. Assuming she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, he unsuccessfully attempts to return to his womanizing routine. The next day, he returns to the café and re-encounters Lucy; they instantly connect over breakfast and Lucy offers to meet him again for breakfast the next morning.

The next day, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue explains to Henry that the year before, Lucy and her father Marlin traveled to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. While they were returning, a cow wandered through a broken fence and onto the road, and the ensuing car accident resulted in Lucy being diagnosed with anterograde amnesia, whereby she remembers everything up until the night before the accident. Although Lucy&#x27;s short-term memory functions normally during the day, that day&#x27;s experiences are lost when she sleeps, and she wakes up every morning thinking that it is Sunday, October 13. To spare her from the trauma of her condition, Marlin and Doug, Lucy&#x27;s steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin&#x27;s birthday daily.

Despite Sue&#x27;s warning, Henry attempts to get Lucy to have breakfast with him several times, but when he unintentionally offends her one day he follows her home to apologize. There he meets Marlin and Doug, who instruct him to not speak to Lucy at breakfast. Heeding Marlin&#x27;s specific orders to avoid the café, Henry arranges various daily schemes to meet Lucy on the road, most of the time managing to successfully impress her over multiple &quot;first&quot; dates and &quot;chance&quot; encounters. Later, Marlin and Doug permit Henry to continue encountering her when they discover Lucy regularly singing the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; in her painting studio just on the days Henry managed to meet her, the first major change in her routine since the accident.

One day at breakfast, Lucy notices a police officer writing a ticket because of her expired license plates. With the ruse exposed, she is distressed to learn that her friends and family have maintained the charade for so long. However, while analyzing her reaction, Henry surmises that her strongest reactions are to feeling betrayed by her loved ones, rather than the actual memory loss. He devises a new strategy to let her know the truth by creating a video with her friends to calmly explain the situation and, rather than continuing her pre-accident routine, they plant the video in her room with a note to play it upon awakening. The strategy succeeds, allowing Lucy to emotionally process her situation and simultaneously be updated on current events, including her relationship with Henry. The couple&#x27;s relationship blossoms via this method, with Lucy enjoying every &quot;first kiss&quot;, and they continue to refine the process while enduring some humorous setbacks. When Lucy eventually discovers that Henry has abandoned 10 years of planning for his research study of walruses in Bristol Bay to help her manage her condition she decides that they need to end their romantic relationship and breaks up with him. Henry reluctantly helps her destroy her journal entries about their time together, effectively erasing it from her memory.

Weeks later, as Henry prepares to leave for his research study, Marlin informs him that Lucy is teaching an art class at a brain-injury institute. As a parting gift, he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD; and as Henry pilots the boat and cries while listening to the CD he suddenly realizes that, since Lucy&#x27;s only sang &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; on days when they &quot;met&quot;, Marlin&#x27;s gift may be his way of hinting that Lucy had new learned memory retention. Henry hurries to Lucy&#x27;s class, but despite not remembering him she happily reveals that she dreams of him nightly, and shows him dozens of portraits that she has painted of him, and they reconcile. Sometime later, she awakens and plays the tape marked &quot;Good Morning Lucy&quot;, which now ends with her and Henry&#x27;s wedding. Henry tells her on the tape that she is on his boat, and to put on a coat because it&#x27;s cold outside. She is amazed to view glaciers through the porthole, and goes up on deck where she sees her father fishing, once again meets Henry, and joyfully embraces their young daughter, Nicole.

==Production==

On October 29, 2002, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Columbia Pictures had bought a spec script from screenwriter George Wing, titled &quot;Fifty First Kisses&quot;, with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore originally in negotiations to star in the lead roles. Barrymore was sold on the script and wrote Sandler a letter suggesting it as their next film together since &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;. Sandler joined the cast in December 2002, and was announced as co-producer under his film studio Happy Madison Productions along with Steve Golin&#x27;s Anonymous Content. Sandler then recommended the script to director Peter Segal while they were working post-production on &quot;Anger Management&quot;. Segal agreed to direct, leaving him with only two days of break from work before filming. Segal revealed that the studio had changed the original title to &quot;50 First Dates&quot; because &quot;marketing found that the term &#x27;kisses&#x27; was turning off guys&quot;.

While the script is primarily credited to George Wing, Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel, Tim Herlihy, and Allen Covert did uncredited rewrites on it as well. Adam Sandler had also reworked the script, significantly transforming its genre from drama to comedy. Additional changes Sandler made to the script include moving its setting from Seattle to Hawaii and rewriting a decent amount of interior scenes that takes place in a café. Director Peter Segal felt these scenes were &quot;very claustrophobic&quot; as well as derivative of &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, encouraging Sandler to rewrite these and move the location to the Kualoa Ranch. Sandler said that shooting in Hawaii &quot;just seemed like the very best possible place to do it for many different reasons. You don&#x27;t see many movies [set] there, so it was a great experience to film in a different locale. And it is such a spectacularly beautiful place for a romantic comedy.&quot;

Most of the film was shot on location in Kaneohe, Kaaawa, Wahiawa, Makapuu, Waimānalo, and Honolulu, as well as in Kāneohe Bay in 2003. The Hukilau Cafe where Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler had breakfast each morning is still standing in Laie, Hawaii. The opening credit scene of Hawaii is Chinaman&#x27;s hat, a popular destination in itself. The road they drive on each day is located in Ka’a’awa Valley, popular filming location within Kualoa Ranch and is viewable through film site tour provided by the estate. The estate also sells merchandise related to this movie and other movies filmed there. Due to the high cost of filming outside of the studio zone, some interior scenes (such as inside the Whitmore residence) were shot on sets in Los Angeles decorated to look like they were in Hawaii.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack contains cover versions of songs that were originally recorded in the 1980s and 1990s. This includes mostly reggae-style covers. It was a moderate commercial hit, reaching number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 1 on the Top Soundtracks chart and Top Reggae Albums chart in the United States.

Despite being prominently featured in the film, neither the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; nor Israel Kamakawiwoʻole&#x27;s 1990 &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; was included on the soundtrack.

The soundtrack was produced by 311&#x27;s frontman, Nick Hexum. 311 provided a cover of the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Lovesong&quot; for the soundtrack. It is heard over the film&#x27;s end credits.

===Home media===
&quot;50 First Dates&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on June 15, 2004.

==Critical reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;50 First Dates&quot; has a score of 45% based on 175 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Gross-out humor overwhelms the easy chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, who bring some energy and yucks to this tale of a girl with short-term memory loss and the guy who tries to get her to love him.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48% based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

Critics who enjoyed the film (such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer A. O. Scott) praised the uplifting story while lamenting the seemingly excessive and incongruous amount of crude humor and drug references. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, saying &quot;The movie is sort of an experiment for Sandler. He reveals the warm side of his personality, and leaves behind the hostility, anger and gross-out humor... The movie doesn&#x27;t have the complexity and depth of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;... but as entertainment it&#x27;s ingratiating and lovable.&quot; Rex Reed was scathing in his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, calling the film &quot;stupid, coarse and abysmally unfunny&quot; while singling out offensive humor about brain damage.
Sandler and Barrymore won the award for Best On-Screen Team at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. The two actors, who had previously worked together in the film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, are said to regard &quot;50 First Dates&quot; as one of their favorite collaborations as professional &quot;soul mates&quot;.

==Depiction of amnesia==
Anterograde amnesia is a condition where one loses the ability to form new memories after damage to the brain. Damage to the hippocampus, which is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain, has been widely associated as a determining factor of the gravity of the condition.

In an article in &quot;The BMJ&quot; on depictions of amnesia in film, clinical neuropsychologist Sallie Baxendale writes that &quot;50 First Dates&quot; &quot;maintains a venerable movie tradition of portraying an amnesic syndrome that bears no relation to any known neurological or psychiatric condition&quot;. True amnesic syndromes are usually a result of a stroke, brain infection, or neurosurgery; very rarely does amnesia result from just car accidents.

In one case, a British woman named Michelle Philpots suffered traumatic brain injuries after two motor vehicle accidents in 1985 then 1990. Subsequently, she developed epilepsy in 1994, which led to her anterograde amnesia. She does not remember anything subsequent to 1994 and also can suffer from shorter term memory loss on the timescale of minutes. Her condition caused her to be fired from her office job after photocopying a single document over and over again, having forgotten she had already completed the task. Each morning, she wakes up believing it is 1994 and her husband, who she met prior to her accident, has to convince her of their 1997 marriage, using a photo album as proof.

In 2010, researchers described a woman who developed a similar kind of memory impairment after she was involved in a car crash. She described her memory as being normal for events on the same day, with memories from the previous day subsequently being lost each night. However, a neuropsychological test revealed some improvement in recall for tasks which she had, unknowingly, performed the previous day. Although the woman claimed not to have seen &quot;50 First Dates&quot; prior to her 2005 crash (but has watched it several times since), she stated that Drew Barrymore was her favorite actress, leading researchers to conclude that her condition might have been influenced by some knowledge of the film&#x27;s plot, and its impact upon her understanding of amnesia.

In July 2015, two people were discovered to have a form of anterograde amnesia that resembles the type depicted in the movie. One is a man in the UK, originally from Germany. He wakes up every day thinking it is March 14, 2005, because that is the day he underwent anesthesia for a dental procedure which led to this condition as a rare, unexplained complication (however, his anterograde amnesia, like that of others with the condition, causes him to forget facts not daily, but within 90 minutes). The other is a woman who reportedly believes every day is October 15, 2014; she was visiting Kettering General Hospital for a kickboxing injury when she slipped and hit her head on a metal pole.

===Real-world application===
In 2015, the Hebrew Home of Riverdale, Bronx, had started an experimental program in which residents with early dementia watch a video every morning wherein they see comforting messages and reminders from family members who they may still know. The program was to be evaluated for potential inclusion of more residents. Robert Abrams of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital considered this idea &quot;both innovative and thoughtful&quot;. Charlotte Dell, director of social services for the home, said the program was inspired by &quot;50 First Dates&quot;.

<text>Gabriel Miró Ferrer (; Alicante, 28 July 1879 – Madrid, 24 May 1930), known as Gabriel Miró, was a Spanish modernist writer. In 1900 he finished his studies in law at the University of Granada and the University of Valencia. He focused mainly on writing novels, but also collaborated to a large number of newspapers such as: &quot;El Heraldo, Los Lunes de El Imparcial, ABC&quot; and &quot;El Sol&quot;. He was among the contributors of the Madrid-based avant-garde magazine &quot;Prometeo&quot; between 1908 and 1912. The rich and poetic language, the philosophical and theological ideas, and the subtle irony are some of the main characteristics of his works. Gabriel Miró preferred to focus on the intimate world of his characters and its development, in the inner relations between everything in their surrounding and the way they evolve in time.

He is the author of more than 20 novels. Most critics believe that Gabriel Miró&#x27;s literary maturity begins with &quot;Las cerezas del cementerio&quot; (&quot;Cemetery cherries&quot;) (1910), whose plot revolves around the tragic love of the super-sensitive young man Félix Valdivia for an older woman (Beatriz) and presents—with an atmosphere of voluptuousness and lyrical —the themes of eroticism, illness, and death.

==Work==
In 1915 he published &quot;El abuelo del rey&quot; (&quot;The King&#x27;s grandfather&quot;), a novel that tells the story of three generations of a tiny Levantine town, for the sake of presenting, and not without a little irony, the struggle between tradition and progress, the pressures of one&#x27;s environment, and above all, a meditation about time.

One year later, &quot;Figuras de la Pasión del Señor&quot; (&quot;Characters from Our Lord Passion&quot;) (1916–17) was published, formed by a series of scenes about the last days of Jesus. Also in 1917, Miró began his autobiographical-style works with &quot;Libro de Sigüenza&quot; (&quot;Sigüenza&#x27;s book&quot;), in which &quot;Sigüenza&quot; is not only the heteronym or alter-ego of the author, but the author&#x27;s own lyrical self, which gives unity to the scenes which comprise the book.

&quot;El humo dormido&quot; (&quot;The sleeping smoke&quot;) (1919) is one of his most personal books and contains various autobiographical moments. There the author mingles reflections on topics like childhood, life, death, friendship, innocence, imagination, faith and beauty. These are also the main topics of his literary works as a whole. In &quot;Años y leguas&quot; (&quot;Years and leagues&quot;) (1928) he again turns back to his character of Sigüenza as a protagonist, are of a similar nature.

In 1921, he finished two more books: &quot;El ángel, el molino, el caracol del faro&quot; (&quot;The angel, the mill, the lighthouse snail&quot;), a book of scenes, and the novel &quot;Nuestro padre San Daniel&quot; (&quot;Our father Saint Daniel&quot;), which is part of a series with &quot;El obispo leproso&quot; (&quot;The leprous bishop&quot;)(1926). Both play out in the Levantine city of &quot;Oleza&quot;, a reflection of Orihuela, in the last third of the 19th century. The city, submerged in lethargy, is seen as a microcosm of mysticism and sensuality, in which the characters debate between their natural inclinations and social repression, and intolerance and the religious resistance to progress to which they are submitted.

Ricardo Gullón has described the Miró&#x27;s stories as lyrical novels. They pay more attention to the expression of feelings and sensations than the simple act of listing events. The hallmarks of Miró&#x27;s work are:

#The use of the ellipsis and
#The structuring of the story in disparate scenes, joined by reflection and memory

Impermanence is the essential theme of the author, who incorporates the past into a continuing present, through sensations, evocation, and memory.

Like Azorín before him, the senses are a form of creation and knowledge in Miró&#x27;s work, hence
#the vivid style of his work,
#the use of synthesis and sensory images
#surprising adjectives and
#a lavish vocabulary

For background on his reading Macdonald&#x27;s monograph, &quot;Gabriel Miró: his private library and his literary background.&quot; provides illumination.

<text>Alice Parizeau, OC (née Alicja Poznańska; 25 July 1930 – 30 September 1990) was a Polish-Canadian writer, essayist, journalist and criminologist.

==Early life==
Her parents were Stanislaw Poznański (1894 - 1943) and Rebeka (Bronislawa Breina) Kestenberg (1892-1943) Polish Jews murdered in the Holocaust, both in Otwock, Poland according to the testimony of Kestenberg&#x27;s brother, Yehuda Adam Kestenberg, recorded in Yad Vashem. Stanislaw Poznański was the son of Karol Poznański and grandson of Izrael Poznański, a famous Polish-Jewish businessman, textile magnate and philanthropist (Philanthropy) in Łódź.

Born in Łuniniec, Poland, as a young girl Poznańska was associated with the Polish Home Army during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising during World War II, which led to her internment in the Bergen-Belsen prisoner of war camp and her receipt of a war medal following the war.

Following the war Poznańska went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, earning degrees in literature, law and political science. In 1955 she visited a friend from the Sorbonne in Quebec, where she accepted a short contract which would turn into a lifelong stay. She married economist and politician Jacques Parizeau the following year.

Though of Jewish background, and interned in Bergen Belsen during the Holocaust, Alice Poznanska&#x27;s funeral was held at a Catholic church.

==Career==
As a Quebecer, Parizeau was strongly associated with Montreal&#x27;s intellectual and sovereigntist scenes, respectively. While best known as a novelist and journalist — she wrote for &quot;Cité libre&quot;, &quot;La Presse&quot;, &quot;Châtelaine&quot;, &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, &quot;La Patrie&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; — Parizeau held a number of other positions. These included civil servant with the City of Montreal, researcher for Société Radio-Canada and, most notably, criminology researcher, lecturer and secretary-general of the Centre international de criminologie comparée at the Université de Montréal, where she served for many years as the &quot;de facto&quot; assistant director to Denis Szabo, founder of modern criminology in Quebec.

Parizeau&#x27;s writing was known for its outstanding storytelling and sensitive treatment of themes relating both to the Quebec people, which she portrayed in romantic terms congruent with the sovereignty movement&#x27;s ideals, and life in and exile from Poland. She won the &quot;Prix européen de l&#x27;Association des écrivains de langue française&quot; in 1982 for her novel &quot;Les lilas fleurissent à Varsovie&quot; (translated as &quot;The Lilacs are Blooming in Warsaw&quot;). In 1987, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Many members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, including the press, criticised her for accepting an honour from the Governor General of Canada.

==Memorials==
In 1990, Parizeau died of cancer in Outremont, Quebec, leaving her husband, Jacques, and two children, Isabelle, a lawyer, and Bernard, a doctor. The École Alice Parizeau in Montreal and the Bibliothèque Alice-Parizeau in Saint-Esprit, Quebec were named in her honour.

<text>Species reintroduction is the deliberate release of a species into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism is capable of survival. The goal of species reintroduction is to establish a healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population. Species that may be eligible for reintroduction are typically threatened or endangered in the wild. However, reintroduction of a species can also be for pest control; for example, wolves being reintroduced to a wild area to curb an overpopulation of deer. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term &quot;reestablishment&quot;.

Humans have been reintroducing species for food and pest control for thousands of years. However, the practice of reintroducing for conservation is much younger, starting in the 20th century.

==Methods for sourcing individuals==
There are a variety of approaches to species reintroduction. The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism. The first matter to address when beginning a species reintroduction is whether to source individuals &quot;in situ&quot;, from wild populations, or &quot;ex situ&quot;, from captivity in a zoo or botanic garden, for example.

===&quot;In situ&quot; sourcing===
&quot;In situ&quot; sourcing for restorations involves moving individuals from an existing wild population to a new site where the species was formerly extirpated. Ideally, populations should be sourced &quot;in situ&quot; when possible due to the numerous risks associated with reintroducing organisms from captive populations to the wild. To ensure that reintroduced populations have the best chance of surviving and reproducing, individuals should be sourced from populations that genetically and ecologically resemble the recipient population. Generally, sourcing from populations with similar environmental conditions to the reintroduction site will maximize the chance that reintroduced individuals are well adapted to the habitat of the reintroduction site otherwise there are possibilities that they will not take to their environment. .

One consideration for &quot;in situ&quot; sourcing is at which life stage the organisms should be collected, transported, and reintroduced. For instance, with plants, it is often ideal to transport them as seeds as they have the best chance of surviving translocation at this stage. However, some plants are difficult to establish as seed and may need to be translocated as juveniles or adults.

===&quot;Ex situ&quot; sourcing===
In situations where &quot;in situ&quot; collection of individuals is not feasible, such as for rare and endangered species with too few individuals existing in the wild, &quot;ex situ&quot; collection is possible.
&quot;Ex situ&quot; collection methods allow storage of individuals that have high potential for reintroduction. Storage examples include germplasm stored in seed banks, sperm and egg banks, cryopreservation, and tissue culture. Methods that allow for storage of a high numbers of individuals also aim to maximize genetic diversity. Stored materials generally have long lifespans in storage, but some species do lose viability when stored as seed. Tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques have only been perfected for a few species.

Organisms may also be kept in living collections in captivity. Living collections are more costly than storing germplasm and hence can support only a fraction of the individuals that &quot;ex situ&quot; sourcing can. Risk increases when sourcing individuals to add to living collections. Loss of genetic diversity is a concern because fewer individuals stored. Individuals may also become genetically adapted to captivity, which often adversely affects the reproductive fitness of individuals. Adaptation to captivity may make individuals less suitable for reintroduction to the wild. Thus, efforts should be made to replicate wild conditions and minimize time spent in captivity whenever possible.

==Successes and failures==

Reintroduction biology is a relatively young discipline and continues to be a work in progress. No strict and accepted definition of reintroduction success exists, but it has been proposed that the criteria widely used to assess the conservation status of endangered taxa, such as the IUCN Red List criteria, should be used to assess reintroduction success. Successful reintroduction programs should yield viable and self-sustainable populations in the long-term. The IUCN/SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group &amp; Environment Agency, in their 2011 Global Re-introduction Perspectives, compiled reintroduction case studies from around the world. 184 case studies were reported on a range of species which included invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and plants. Assessments from all of the studies included goals, success indicators, project summary, major difficulties faced, major lessons learned, and success of project with reasons for success or failure. A similar assessment focused solely on plants found high rates of success for rare species reintroductions. An analysis of data from the Center for Plant Conservation International Reintroduction Registry found that, for the 49 cases where data were available, 92% of the reintroduced plant populations survived two years.
The Siberian tiger population has rebounded from 40 individuals in the 1940s to around 500 in 2007. The Siberian tiger population is now the largest un-fragmented tiger population in the world. Yet, a high proportion of translocations and reintroductions have not been successful in establishing viable populations.
For instance, in China reintroduction of captive Giant Pandas have had mixed effects. The initial pandas released from captivity all died quickly after reintroduction. Even now that they have improved their ability to reintroduce pandas, concern remains over how well the captive-bred pandas will fare with their wild relatives.

Many factors can attribute to the success or failure of a reintroduction. Predators, food, pathogens, competitors, and weather can all affect a reintroduced population&#x27;s ability to grow, survive, and reproduce. The number of animals reintroduced in an attempt should also vary with factors such as social behavior, expected rates of predation, and density in the wild. Animals raised in captivity may experience stress during captivity or translocation, which can weaken their immune systems.
The IUCN reintroduction guidelines emphasize the need for an assessment of the availability of suitable habitat as a key component of reintroduction planning. Poor assessment of the release site can increase the chances that the species will reject the site and perhaps move to a less suitable environment. This can decrease the species fitness and thus decrease chances for survival. They state that restoration of the original habitat and amelioration of causes of extinction must be explored and considered as essential conditions for these projects. Unfortunately, the monitoring period that should follow reintroductions often remains neglected.

== Genetic considerations ==
When a species has been extirpated from a site where it previously existed, individuals that will comprise the reintroduced population must be sourced from wild or captive populations. When sourcing individuals for reintroduction, it is important to consider local adaptation, adaptation to captivity (for &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation), the possibility of inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression, and taxonomy, ecology, and genetic diversity of the source population. Reintroduced populations experience increased vulnerability to influences of drift, selection, and gene flow evolutionary processes due to their small sizes, climatic and ecological differences between source and native habitats, and presence of other mating-compatible populations.

If the species slated for reintroduction is rare in the wild, it is likely to have unusually low population numbers, and care should be taken to avoid inbreeding and inbreeding depression. Inbreeding can change the frequency of allele distribution in a population, and potentially result in a change to crucial genetic diversity. Additionally, outbreeding depression can occur if a reintroduced population can hybridize with existing populations in the wild, which can result in offspring with reduced fitness, and less adaptation to local conditions. To minimize both, practitioners should source for individuals in a way that captures as much genetic diversity as possible, and attempt to match source site conditions to local site conditions as much as possible.

Capturing as much genetic diversity as possible, measured as heterozygosity, is suggested in species reintroductions. Some protocols suggest sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the genetic diversity. Maintaining genetic diversity in the recipient population is crucial to avoiding the loss of essential local adaptations, minimizing inbreeding depression, and maximizing fitness of the reintroduced population.

=== Ecological similarity ===
Plants or animals that undergo reintroduction may exhibit reduced fitness if they are not sufficiently adapted to local environmental conditions. Therefore, researchers should consider ecological and environmental similarity of source and recipient sites when selecting populations for reintroduction. Environmental factors to consider include climate and soil traits (pH, percent clay, silt and sand, percent combustion carbon, percent combustion nitrogen, concentration of Ca, Na, Mg, P, K). Historically, sourcing plant material for reintroductions has followed the rule &quot;local is best,&quot; as the best way to preserve local adaptations, with individuals for reintroductions selected from the most geographically proximate population. However, geographic distance was shown in a common garden experiment to be an insufficient predictor of fitness. Additionally, projected climatic shifts induced by climate change have led to the development of new seed sourcing protocols that aim to source seeds that are best adapted to project climate conditions. Conservation agencies have developed seed transfer zones that serve as guidelines for how far plant material can be transported before it will perform poorly. Seed transfer zones take into account proximity, ecological conditions, and climatic conditions in order to predict how plant performance will vary from one zone to the next. A study of the reintroduction of &quot;Castilleja levisecta&quot; found that the source populations most physically near the reintroduction site performed the poorest in a field experiment, while those from the source population whose ecological conditions most closely matched the reintroduction site performed best, demonstrating the importance of matching the evolved adaptations of a population to the conditions at the reintroduction site.

=== Adaptation to captivity ===
Some reintroduction programs use plants or animals from captive populations to form a reintroduced population. When reintroducing individuals from a captive population to the wild, there is a risk that they have adapted to captivity due to differential selection of genotypes in captivity versus the wild.
The genetic basis of this adaptation is selection of rare, recessive alleles that are deleterious in the wild but preferred in captivity. Consequently, animals adapted to captivity show reduced stress tolerance, increased tameness, and loss of local adaptations. Plants also can show adaptations to captivity through changes in drought tolerance, nutrient requirements, and seed dormancy requirements. Extent of adaptation is directly related to intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population size and number of generations in captivity.
Characteristics selected for in captivity are overwhelmingly disadvantageous in the wild, so such adaptations can lead to reduced fitness following reintroduction.
Reintroduction projects that introduce wild animals generally experience higher success rates than those that use captive-bred animals. Genetic adaptation to captivity can be minimized through management methods: by maximizing generation length and number of new individuals added to the captive population; minimizing effective population size, number of generations spent in captivity, and selection pressure; and reducing genetic diversity by fragmenting the population. For plants, minimizing adaptation to captivity is usually achieved by sourcing plant material from a seed bank, where individuals are preserved as wild-collected seeds, and have not had the chance to adapt to conditions in captivity. However, this method is only plausible for plants with seed dormancy.

=== Genetic trade-offs ===
In reintroductions from captivity, translocation of animals from captivity to the wild has implications for both captive and wild populations. Reintroduction of genetically valuable animals from captivity improves genetic diversity of reintroduced populations while depleting captive populations; conversely, genetically valuable captive-bred animals may be closely related to individuals in the wild and thus increase risk of inbreeding depression if reintroduced.
Increasing genetic diversity is favored with removal of genetically overrepresented individuals from captive populations and addition of animals with low genetic relatedness to the wild. However, in practice, initial reintroduction of individuals with low genetic value to the captive population is recommended to allow for genetic assessment before translocation of valuable individuals.

== Improving research techniques ==
A cooperative approach to reintroduction by ecologists and biologists could improve research techniques. For both preparation and monitoring of reintroductions, increasing contacts between academic population biologists and wildlife managers is encouraged within the Survival Species Commission and the IUCN. The IUCN states that a re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds. A survey by Wolf et al. in 1998 indicated that 64% of reintroduction projects have used subjective opinion to assess habitat quality. This means that most reintroduction evaluation has been based on human anecdotal evidence and not enough has been based on statistical findings. Seddon et al. (2007) suggest that researchers contemplating future reintroductions should specify goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction, and planning and evaluation processes should incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches.

Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; both before and after the reintroduction. Intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unfavorable. Population dynamics models that integrate demographic parameters and behavioral data recorded in the field can lead to simulations and tests of a priori hypotheses. Using previous results to design further decisions and experiments is a central concept of adaptive management. In other words, learning by doing can help in future projects. Population ecologists should therefore collaborate with biologists, ecologists, and wildlife management to improve reintroduction programs.

=== Genetic monitoring ===
For reintroduced populations to successfully establish and maximize reproductive fitness, practitioners should perform genetic tests to select which individuals will be the founders of reintroduced populations and to continue monitoring populations post-reintroduction. A number of methods are available to measure the genetic relatedness between and variation among individuals within populations. Common genetic diversity assessment tools include microsatellite markers, mitochondrial DNA analyses, alloenzymes, and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Post-reintroduction, genetic monitoring tools can be used to obtain data such as population abundance, effective population size, and population structure, and can also be used to identify instances of inbreeding within reintroduced populations or hybridization with existing populations that are genetically compatible. Long-term genetic monitoring is recommended post-reintroduction to track changes in genetic diversity of the reintroduced population and determine success of a reintroduction program.
Adverse genetic changes such as loss of heterozygosity may indicate management intervention, such as population supplementation, is necessary for survival of the reintroduced population.

==Re-introduction Specialist Group (RSG)==
The RSG is a network of specialists whose aim is to combat the ongoing and massive loss of biodiversity by using re-introductions as a responsible tool for the management and restoration of biodiversity. It does this by actively developing and promoting sound inter-disciplinary scientific information, policy, and practice to establish viable wild populations in their natural habitats.
The role of the RSG is to promote the re-establishment of viable populations in the wild of animals and plants. The need for this role was felt due to the increased demand from re-introduction practitioners, the global conservation community and increase in re-introduction projects worldwide.

Increasing numbers of animal and plant species are becoming rare, or even extinct in the wild. In an attempt to re-establish populations, species can – in some instances – be re-introduced into an area, either through translocation from existing wild populations, or by re-introducing captive-bred animals or artificially propagated plants.

<text>Edmund Leonard Thigpen (December 28, 1930 – January 13, 2010) was an American jazz drummer, best known for his work with the Oscar Peterson trio from 1959 to 1965. Thigpen also performed with the Billy Taylor trio from 1956 to 1959.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Thigpen was raised in Los Angeles, and attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where Art Farmer, Dexter Gordon, and Chico Hamilton also attended. After majoring in sociology at Los Angeles City College, Thigpen returned to East St. Louis for one year to pursue music while living with his father who had been playing with Andy Kirk&#x27;s Clouds of Joy. His father, Ben Thigpen, was a drummer who played with Andy Kirk for sixteen years during the 1930s and 1940s.

Thigpen first worked professionally in New York City with the Cootie Williams orchestra from 1951 to 1952 at the Savoy Ballroom. During this time he played with musicians such as Dinah Washington, Gil Mellé, Oscar Pettiford, Eddie Vinson, Paul Quinichette, Ernie Wilkins, Charlie Rouse, Lennie Tristano, Jutta Hipp, Johnny Hodges, Dorothy Ashby, Bud Powell, and Billy Taylor.

In 1959, he replaced guitarist Herb Ellis in the Oscar Peterson Trio in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1961, he recorded in Los Angeles, featuring on the Teddy Edwards–Howard McGhee Quintet album entitled &quot;Together Again!!!!&quot; for the Contemporary label with Phineas Newborn Jr. and Ray Brown. After leaving Peterson, Thigpen recorded the album &quot;Out of the Storm&quot; as a leader for Verve in 1966. He then went on to tour with Ella Fitzgerald from 1967 to 1972.

In 1972, Thigpen moved to Copenhagen, joining several other American jazz musicians who had settled in that city over the previous two decades. There he worked with fellow American expatriates, including Kenny Drew, Ernie Wilkins, Thad Jones, as well as leading Danish jazz musicians such as Svend Asmussen, Mads Vinding, Alex Riel, and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. He also played with a variety of other leading musicians of the time, such as Clark Terry, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Milt Jackson, and Monty Alexander.

Thigpen died peacefully after a brief period in Hvidovre Hospital in Copenhagen on January 13, 2010. He had been hospitalized for heart and lung problems and was also suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He is buried at Vestre Kirkegård.

<text>The Grumman F11F/F-11 Tiger is a supersonic, single-seat carrier-based fighter aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Grumman. For a time, it held the world altitude record of , as well as being the first supersonic fighter to be produced by Grumman.

Work on what would become the Tiger commenced in 1952 as a design study, internally designated &quot;G-98&quot;, to improve the F9F-6/7 Cougar. However, the resulting design produced had little association with the Cougar by the end of the project. The U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics placed order for two prototypes, initially designated &quot;XF9F-8&quot;. On 30 July 1954, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, during which it almost achieved Mach 1; the second prototype became the second U.S. Navy aircraft to exceed the speed of sound. On 21 September 1956, the Tiger became the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down. Originally designated the &quot;F11F Tiger&quot; in April 1955 under the pre-1962 Navy designation system, the aircraft was redesignated as &quot;F-11 Tiger&quot; under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. A total of 199 Tigers were produced for the United States Navy, with the last aircraft being delivered to the service on 23 January 1959.

The Tiger entered service with the U.S. Navy during 1956, and was flown from the carriers , , , , , , and . Frontline use of the Tiger was relatively brief, largely due to its performance being inferior to the competing Vought F-8 Crusader, such as its limited endurance, while its Wright J65 turbojet engine had also proved to be somewhat unreliable. Through to the late 1960s, the aircraft used flown by the Naval Air Training Command in South Texas at NAS Chase Field and NAS Kingsville, to give students experience of supersonic flight. Between 1957 and 1969, the Tiger was used by the Blue Angels flight team, being eventually replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The last examples were withdrawn from U.S. Navy service during 1969, although a handful of aircraft remained operational and were conducting test flights as late as 1975.

==Design and development==
===Background===


The origins of the F11F (F-11) Tiger can be traced back to a privately funded 1952 Grumman concept to modernize and improve the F9F-6/7 Cougar, a popular early jet-powered carrier aircraft. The design team opted to implement the area rule along with several other advances into the project, which was internally designated &quot;G-98&quot;. Design objectives included the minimisation of the aircraft&#x27;s size. By the time that the design process was concluded during 1953, it had become a complete departure from the Cougar, bearing little more than a vague resemblance to the preceding aircraft. 

It features a new wing equipped with both full-span leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps with roll control being achieved using spoilers rather than traditional ailerons. For storage on aircraft carriers, these wings could be manually folded downwards. Anticipating supersonic performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed to be powered by the Wright J65 turbojet, a license-built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire.

The design&#x27;s potential for supersonic performance and reduced transonic drag drew the attention of several officials, including those within the United States Navy. During early 1953, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics decided to commit itself to the project&#x27;s full development, placing an initial order for two prototypes, which were designated &quot;XF9F-8&quot; (even though the new fighter was clearly a new design). To add to the confusion, the prototypes were then redesignated &quot;XF9F-9&quot; while the XF9F-8 designation was assigned to a different, more straightforward, derivative of the Cougar.

===Flight testing===
Since the afterburning version of the J65 was not ready, the first prototype made its maiden flight on 30 July 1954 powered by a non-afterburning engine. In spite of this, the aircraft nearly reached Mach 1 during this first flight. The second prototype, equipped with the afterburning engine, became the second supersonic U.S. Navy aircraft, the first being the Douglas F4D Skyray. During April 1955, the aircraft received the new designation &quot;F11F-1&quot; (F-11A after adoption of the unified Tri-Service naming system in 1962). On 4 April 1956, carrier trials started when an F11F-1 Tiger landed on and launched from .

The Tiger gained the dubious distinction of being the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down. On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20 mm (0.79 in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the trajectory of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling the aircraft and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived with a broken leg and multiple broken vertebrae.

Grumman proposed several models of the Tiger, beyond the F-11A (F11F-1) fighter, including aerial reconnaissance and dedicated trainer versions. The more advanced version of the airframe to be proposed by the company was the F11F-1F Super Tiger. It was the result of a 1955 study to install the new General Electric J79 engine into the F11F-1 airframe. When evaluated by Switzerland for a potential procurement, it was assessed as having exceeded all competing aircraft in terms of overall technical performance. Grumman also proposed to produce a variant powered by the proven, and even more powerful, Rolls-Royce Avon engine in place of the J79.

==Operational history==

Seven U.S. Navy squadrons flew the Tiger, these included VF-21 and VF-33 in the Atlantic Fleet and VA-156 (redesignated VF-111 in January 1959), VF-24 (redesignated VF-211 in March 1959), VF-51, VF-121, and VF-191 in the Pacific Fleet. The aircraft was operated from the carriers , , , , , , , and Independence. The F11F&#x27;s career as a frontline fighter lasted only four years, largely as a result of its performance being inferior to the competing and considerably faster Vought F-8 Crusader; further factors included the unreliability of its J65 powerplant, and the inadequacy of both its range and endurance. At no point was the Tiger ever capable of sustained supersonic flight in an operational configuration. The Navy opted to cancel its orders for the &quot;F11F-1P&quot; reconnaissance version, thus only 199 F11F-1 (F-11A) fighters were ever built.

By 1961, the Tiger had been permanently withdrawn from carrier operations. Nevertheless, it continued to be operated by the Naval Air Training Command in South Texas at NAS Chase Field and NAS Kingsville, through to the late 1960s. Typically, students performed advanced jet training in the TF-9J Cougar, and upon completing that syllabus, were given a brief taste of supersonic capability with the F-11 before transitioning to active fleet fighters. The Tiger&#x27;s flight characteristics lent itself well to the training role.

While the Tiger&#x27;s career as a fighter was relatively short, the Blue Angels performed in the aircraft between 1957 and 1969, at which point the Tiger was replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

Prior to the 1962 code unification, the Tiger was designated as the &quot;F11F&quot;; after unification, it was redesignated &quot;F-11&quot;.

During 1973, two former Blue Angels F-11As were taken from storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and modified by Grumman as testbeds to evaluate in-flight thrust control systems. BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries thrust reverser and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a chase plane. Tests of the inflight thrust reversal were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at NATC Patuxent River, Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB. These were the last Tigers to fly.

<doc id="477125" wikidata="Q3491521" url="?curid=477125" title="Psychological pain">
<text>Psychological pain, mental pain, or emotional pain is an unpleasant feeling (a suffering) of a psychological, non-physical origin. A pioneer in the field of suicidology, Edwin S. Shneidman, described it as &quot;how much you hurt as a human being. It is mental suffering; mental torment.&quot; There are numerous ways psychological pain is referred to, using a different word usually reflects an emphasis on a particular aspect of mind life. Technical terms include algopsychalia and psychalgia, but it may also be called mental pain, emotional pain, psychic pain, social pain,
spiritual or soul pain, or suffering. While these clearly are not equivalent terms, one systematic comparison of theories and models of psychological pain, psychic pain, emotional pain, and suffering concluded that each describe the same profoundly unpleasant feeling. Psychological pain is widely believed to be an inescapable aspect of human existence.

Other descriptions of psychological pain are &quot;a wide range of subjective experiences characterized as an awareness of negative changes in the self and in its functions accompanied by negative feelings&quot;, &quot;a diffuse subjective experience ... differentiated from physical pain which is often localized and associated with noxious physical stimuli&quot;, and &quot;a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self.&quot;

==Causes==
The adjective &quot;psychological&quot; is thought to encompass the functions of beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which may be seen as an indication for the many sources of psychological pain. One way of grouping these different sources of pain was offered by Shneidman, who stated that psychological pain is caused by frustrated psychological needs. For example, the need for love, autonomy, affiliation, and achievement, or the need to avoid harm, shame, and embarrassment. Psychological needs were originally described by Henry Murray in 1938 as needs that motivate human behavior. Shneidman maintained that people rate the importance of each need differently, which explains why people&#x27;s level of psychological pain differs when confronted with the same frustrated need. This needs perspective coincides with Patrick David Wall&#x27;s description of physical pain that says that physical pain indicates a need state much more than a sensory experience.

Unmet psychological needs in youth may cause an inability to meet human needs later in life. As a consequence of neglectful parenting, children with unmet psychological needs may be linked to psychotic disorders in childhood throughout life.

In the fields of social psychology and personality psychology, the term social pain is used to denote psychological pain caused by harm or threat to social connection; bereavement, embarrassment, shame and hurt feelings are subtypes of social pain. From an evolutionary perspective, psychological pain forces the assessment of actual or potential social problems that might reduce the individual&#x27;s fitness for survival. The way people display their psychological pain socially (for example, crying, shouting, moaning) serves the purpose of indicating that they are in need.

==Neuropsychology==
Physical pain and psychological pain share common underlying neurological mechanisms. Brain regions that were consistently found to be implicated in both types of pain are the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex (some subregions more than others), and may extend to other regions as well. Brain regions that were also found to be involved in psychological pain include the insular cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Some advocate that, because similar brain regions are involved in both physical pain and psychological pain, pain should be seen as a continuum that ranges from purely physical to purely psychological. Moreover, many sources mention the fact that many metaphors of physical pain are used to refer to psychologically painful experiences. Further connection between physical and psychological pain has been supported through proof that acetaminophen, an analgesic, can suppress activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex when experiencing social exclusion, the same way that it suppresses activity when experiencing physical pain, and reduces the agitation of people with dementia. However, use of paracetamol for more general psychological pain remains disputed.

==Borderline personality disorder==

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has long been believed to be a disorder that produces the most intense emotional pain and distress in those who have this condition. Studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional suffering and mental agony. Borderline patients may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions, experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness. People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, isolation and perceived failure. Both clinicians and laymen alike have witnessed the desperate attempts to escape these subjective inner experiences of these patients. Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and bulimia nervosa), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, starvation, etc.), compulsive spending, gambling, sex addiction, violent and aggressive behavior, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviors, are desperate attempts to escape this pain.

The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others with major depression, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, schizophrenia, other personality disorders, and a range of other conditions. Although the excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing, it is often linked to severe childhood trauma of abuse and neglect. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, though studies on suicidality in bipolar subjects have found that 4-19% of bipolar patients (mostly untreated) commit suicide. However, 60–70% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts, so suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with BPD.

The intense dysphoric states which patients diagnosed with BPD endure on a regular basis distinguishes them from those with other personality disorders: major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and virtually all known DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II conditions. In a 1998 study entitled &quot;The Pain of Being Borderline: Dysphoric States Specific to Borderline Personality Disorder&quot;, 146 diagnosed borderline patients took a 50-item self-report measure test. The conclusions from this study suggest &quot;that the subjective pain of borderline patients may be both more pervasive and more multifaceted than previously recognised and that the overall &quot;amplitude&quot; of this pain may be a particularly good marker for the borderline diagnosis&quot;.

Feelings of emptiness are a central problem for patients with personality disturbances. In an attempt to avoid this feeling, these patients employ defences to preserve their fragmentary selves. Feelings of emptiness may be so painful that suicide is considered.

<text>&quot;P&#x27;tit Quinquin&quot; is a song by Alexandre Desrousseaux which was written in the Picard language (also known as chti or chtimi) in 1853. Picard is closely related to French, and is spoken in two regions in the north of France – Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Picardy and in parts of the Belgian region of Wallonia.

This simple lullaby (&quot;P&#x27;tit quinquin&quot; means &quot;little child&quot;) demonstrates the revival of Picard in the area, to the extent that it became the marching song of the northern soldiers leaving for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Today it could be called the unofficial anthem of the French city of Lille, and more generally of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France.

<doc id="477143" wikidata="Q10854887" url="?curid=477143" title="US Airways Shuttle">
<text>US Airways Shuttle was the brand name for US Airways&#x27; hourly air shuttle service operating in the Northeastern United States. It served Logan International Airport in Boston, LaGuardia Airport in New York City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C.

The shuttle had various food and beverage offerings that included:
* Breakfast snack served on morning flights before 9 a.m. on business days
* Complimentary soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea
* Complimentary beer and wine after 10 a.m.

First class service was available on all Shuttle flights. Complimentary spirits were offered in addition to the economy offerings.

On October 17, 2015, the shuttle service became known as American Airlines Shuttle.

==History==

The US Airways Shuttle was the descendant of the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, which established service on the route in 1961. Real estate mogul and future (later 45th and 47th) US President Donald Trump purchased the shuttle from Eastern Airlines in 1989, during a time when Eastern was being dismantled by Texas Air. The service was briefly operated as the Trump Shuttle from June 7, 1989, until the company defaulted on loans in September 1990. After the Trump venture failed, ownership passed to a syndicate of 22 lenders to the venture, led by Citigroup.
Unable to sell the operation outright to Northwest Airlines, American Airlines, or USAir Group, the banks negotiated a complex marketing arrangement in which USAir Group would assume 40% ownership of Shuttle, Inc. and would manage the operation for ten years, including selling tickets, keeping financial records, advertising and marketing, aircraft maintenance, and labor relations. On April 7, 1992, Trump Shuttle ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle on April 12.

The Shuttle, Inc. agreement gave USAir an option to purchase the entire shuttle operation on or after October 10, 1996, with an exclusive right to do so until April 10, 1997. USAir Group subsequently announced its intent to exercise its right to purchase the remaining 60% of Shuttle, Inc. on November 19, 1997, but &quot;continued to operate the US Airways Shuttle separately from the rest of the airline. Employees of the Shuttle also operated on a separate seniority list, since the company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group&quot;.

Shuttle Inc. remained as a subsidiary of US Airways Group until July 1, 2000, when &quot;the US Airways Shuttle merged into the mainline operation of US Airways.&quot; US Airways Group, as the USAir Group is now known due to the merger with America West Airlines, repainted their aircraft to remove the &quot;Shuttle&quot; part from the name. As an &quot;airline with an airline,&quot; and a subsidiary and operating division of the USAir Group, the US Airways Shuttle no longer exists.

However, the Northeast service of frequent shuttle flights and strategic marketing by way of the New &quot;merged&quot; US Airways under the US Airways Group, did continue to operate without being considered a separate division or subsidiary airline. During this time, US Airways Shuttle briefly expanded service to Dulles International Airport, near Washington DC, in addition to service to Washington&#x27;s Reagan Airport. This service ended soon after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

All planes on the shuttle routes had a single-class configuration until 2004 when first-class seats were added.

<text>&quot;An Anna Blume&quot; (&quot;To Anna Flower&quot; also translated as &quot;To Eve Blossom&quot;) is a poem written by the German artist Kurt Schwitters in 1919. It has been described as a parody of a love poem, an emblem of the chaos and madness of the era, and as a harbinger of a new poetic language.

==The poem==
Originally published in Herwarth Walden&#x27;s &quot;Der Sturm&quot; magazine in August 1919, the poem made Schwitters famous almost overnight. The poem was parodied in newspapers and magazines, and strongly polarized public opinion.

Whilst Schwitters was never an official member of Berlin Dada, he was closely linked to many members of the group, in particular Raoul Hausmann and Hans Arp, and the poem is written in a dadaist style, using multiple perspectives, fragments of found text, and absurdist elements to mirror the fragmentation of the narrator&#x27;s emotional state in the throes of love, or of Germany&#x27;s political, military and economic collapse after the First World War.

&quot;Elements of poetry are letters, syllables, words, sentences. Poetry arises from the interaction of those elements. Meaning is important only if it employed as one such factor. I play off sense against nonsense. I prefer nonsense, but that is a purely personal matter.&quot; Kurt Schwitters, 1920
The poem was the subject of a particularly well-orchestrated publicity campaign. Initially fly-posted in Hannover, then subject to a spoiler in Herwarth Walden&#x27;s der Sturm magazine asking &#x27;Who really is Anna Blume?&#x27; answered with &#x27;Twited brain! He painted the image of the time and didn&#x27;t know it. Now he kneels before the daisies and prays.&#x27; Christof Spengemann The publication of the poem in September, two months after Schwitters&#x27; first one-man exhibition at Walden&#x27;s Gallery in Berlin, cemented his reputation as a leading experimental collagist and poet. The poem became sufficiently famous to gain an English translation in 1922. It also provoked Berlin Dada into responding by exhibiting the effigy &quot;The Death Of Anna Blume&quot;, by Rudolf Schlichter at the First International Dada Fair, Berlin 1920. Richard Huelsenbeck in particular found the poem offensively sentimental and romantic;

&quot;Dada rejects emphatically and as a matter of principle works like the famous &#x27;Anna Blume&#x27; of Kurt Schwitters.&quot;
==Publication of the artist&#x27;s book==
Later in the year Schwitters would publish the poem in an artist&#x27;s book called &quot;Anna Blume, Dichtungen&quot;. The original book contains several poems and short stories, including &quot;Die Zwiebel&quot; (The Onion), a fairy story about the dismemberment of the narrator Alves Bäsenstiel, who, when reassembled, becomes the new King. The book also includes the poems &quot;Grünes Kind&quot; (Green Child) and &quot;Nächte&quot; (Nights).

The first edition was published by Verlag Paul Steegemann, Hannover, 1919. The second edition, published in 1920, was exactly the same but for 8 extra pages of adverts. The third edition, published in 1922, was substantially different, however. Noticeably smaller, but with more pages (88 compared to the original&#x27;s 40) and a plain white sleeve with a pink border, the revised version only included nine of the original twenty pieces. The other twenty-seven pieces include English, French and Russian translations of &quot;Anna Blume&quot;, &quot;Le Grande Ardeur de Dada (Marche Funèbre)&quot;, a brief critique of dada written in French (&#x27;Let me explain - dada is the great root of all the little roots...&#x27;), and a series of newer poems that would point the way toward Schwitter&#x27;s later poetic style, using a dramatically reduced vocabulary with heavy repetition. &quot;Zwölf&quot; (Twelve), for instance, only uses the first eleven numerals to create an eleven-line poem. (&#x27;One Two Three Four Five / Five Four Three Two One / Two Three Four Five Six / Six Five Four Three Two / Seven Seven Seven Seven Seven...)

The same year, Schwitters also published &quot;Memoiren Anna Blumes in Bleie&quot;, a book that chronicled and parodied reactions to the original book.

== Die Kathedrale ==

In 1920 Schwitters published a second book in the same format, called &quot;Die Kathedrale&quot; (The cathedral). Again published by Paul Steegemann, Hannover, the work contained 8 lithographs, and was published in an edition of c. 3000. The lithographs are in the style of Schwitters&#x27; drawings of the period, using found elements, collage and stamps, along with scratchy pen and ink drawings.

The book uses the cathedral as a metaphor, a theme common amongst Expressionists such as Lyonel Feininger, and was to become a central feature of the organisation of the Bauhaus, with its system of Masters teaching &#x27;apprentices&#x27; and &#x27;journeymen&#x27; trades such as mural painting and weaving.

The title of Schwitters&#x27;s book, &quot;Die Kathedrale&quot;, reflects the Expressionists&#x27; embrace of the Gothic cathedral as an emblem of unification in the arts. The white square of paper on the cover, part of a wraparound seal added by Schwitters, declares, &quot;Beware: Anti-Dada.&quot;
==Constructivism: the move to periodicals==
Schwitters&#x27; style became more constructivist after this, under the influence of El Lissitzky and De Stijl, the Dutch group co-founded by Theo van Doesburg, who was to become a close friend and collaborator. A memoir about Anna Blume (Anna Blume&#x27;s Lead Memoirs in Bleie. An Easy-to-Understand Method for Everyone of How To Learn Madness) was published in 1922 with a markedly cleaner cover in a constructivist style, and this was followed by a series of periodicals, still called Merz, which continued to publish Schwitters&#x27; work, within the context of the emerging International Modernism.

<text>Topologika Software Ltd was an independent British publisher of educational software. Established in Stilton, Cambridgeshire in 1983, the company spent most of its life in Penryn, Cornwall before moving to Brighton, Sussex. The company was dissolved at the end of June 2013. Its educational software continues to be sold by distributors REM via, and is still supported by Topologika&#x27;s founder Brian Kerslake. One of the educational software products was Music Box.

Many of its early products were interactive fiction adventure games taken on after Acornsoft was sold to Superior Software who only continued to release their arcade games. Two of its first releases were Countdown to Doom and Philosopher&#x27;s Quest, written by Peter Killworth. The versions produced by Topologika were large scale improvements upon the originals.

The complete list of adventure games produced by Topologika was as follows:
*Acheton
*Avon
*Countdown to Doom
*Giant Killer
*Hezarin
*Kingdom of Hamil
*Monsters of Murdac
*Philosopher&#x27;s Quest
*Return to Doom
*Sellardore Tales
*Spy Snatcher
*Stig of the Dump
*The Last Days of Doom

Topologika has itself now ceased publishing interactive fiction other than as an element of its ongoing and growing range of educational software which now includes Marshal Anderson&#x27;s interactive fiction on CD and for VLEs (Sellardore Tales and Stig of the Dump) and Peter Killworth&#x27;s maths adventure GiantKiller.

<text>The Southward Car Museum is an automobile museum and event centre in Otaihanga, New Zealand. It was established by Len Southward in the 1970s to house his collection of over 450 vehicles and several aircraft and is now run by a charitable trust. The museum is just north of Paraparaumu on the Kāpiti Coast, about an hour&#x27;s drive from Wellington and situated just east of the North Island Main Trunk railway and State Highway 1, on Otaihanga Road.

The purpose-built building includes a 6000 square metre exhibition hall, engineering workshop, gift shop and small cafe, all set in park-like grounds. The building also incorporates the 474-seat Southward Theatre, which features the 1929 Wurlitzer Unit Orchestra theatre organ that was originally installed in the Civic Theatre in Auckland.

==History==
The core car collection was the personal work of Sir Len Southward and his wife Vera. The couple began collecting cars in 1956 with a Ford Model T.

Having established the largest private car collection in Australasia, in 1976 Len purchased a site on which to establish a museum open to the public.
Ground was broken on the museum site in 1971, but construction wasn&#x27;t given council consent until 1977. The museum officially opened on 22 December 1979.
In 2020 a new exhibit in the museum was opened, detailing Len and Vera&#x27;s lives and achievements, including new digital and material installations.

==Collection==

The museum has about 450 vehicles, which include:

* 1895 Benz Velo, imported to New Zealand in 1900.
* 1915 Stutz Indianapolis race car
* Gull-winged Mercedes-Benz
* 1934 Cadillac V-16 Town Cabriolet - once owned by American actress Marlene Dietrich
* 1939 Mercedes-Benz 770 - believed to have been intended as a gift for Edward VIII after the planned German invasion of Britain
* 1950 Cadillac Sixty Special &quot;gangster special&quot; - belonged to American gangster Mickey Cohen, fitted with armoured body panels and bulletproof plate glass thick.
* DeLorean - best known from the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film series, the only DeLorean on public display in New Zealand.
* 2007 Subaru Impreza WRX STI Rally Car- Driven by Ken Block for the 2007 NZRC Season and Rally New Zealand

<doc id="477158" wikidata="Q1680465" url="?curid=477158" title="Michael Lowry (politician)">
<text>Michael Lowry (born 13 March 1953) is an Irish independent politician who has served as a Teachta Dála (TD) since 1987, currently for the Tipperary North constituency. He previously served as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications from 1994 to 1996 and Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party from 1993 to 1994.

Lowry is a former chair of the Fine Gael party and was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications between 1994 and 1996. He resigned from his ministry in some controversy. Fine Gael barred him from standing for the party again. Thereafter he ran as an Independent candidate and has maintained his seat in the Dáil ever since. The Moriarty Tribunal concluded &quot;beyond doubt&quot; that Lowry was a tax evader and had assisted businessman Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Esat Digifone consortium in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s, during Lowry&#x27;s time as Communications Minister. O&#x27;Brien went on to become one of the richest men in Ireland.

Lowry initiated a defamation lawsuit against an &quot;Irish Independent&quot; journalist, Sam Smyth, over an article that Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal as well as comments that Smyth made on a TV3 show. The lawsuit was thrown out of several courts and Lowry was ordered to pay Smyth&#x27;s legal costs. More recently his relationship with Kevin Phelan has come under scrutiny, with the emergence of a recorded conversation in which Lowry claims to have made an undeclared payment of €250,000.

==Early and personal life==
Lowry was born in County Tipperary and educated at CBS Thurles. He was elected to North Tipperary County Council in 1979. In the early 1980s he was a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) administrator, and was the youngest-ever chair of that body&#x27;s Tipperary County Board. He runs a commercial refrigeration business, Streamline Enterprises, that he founded in controversial circumstances in 1988. Later, as chair of the Semple Stadium Development Committee, he was involved in raising the necessary funds for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the All-Ireland Centenary Hurling final in 1984.

He married Catherine McGrath in 1981, and they had three children. They are separated.

==National politics==
===Fine Gael===
Lowry was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for Tipperary North at the 1987 general election and in 1993 he became Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party.

In 1994 he was appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the Rainbow Coalition government.

A succession of political scandals pursued Lowry throughout his time in office. These included allegations of irregularities relating to the granting of a mobile phone licence to Esat Telecom, which were later investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal, plans for the Dublin Light Rail System and the closure of rural post offices. The 1997 McCracken Tribunal revealed supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne had paid IR£395,000 for an extension to Lowry&#x27;s home in Tipperary. The Tribunal concluded that Lowry had evaded tax.

This allegation prompted Lowry&#x27;s resignation from the Cabinet in November 1996. Taoiseach John Bruton announced that Lowry would not be allowed to stand as a Fine Gael candidate at the next election, and he resigned from the party.

===Independent===
Lowry announced that he would stand as an independent candidate in the 1997 general election. He topped the poll in his constituency in that election, and did so again in the 2002 and 2007 general elections.

Lowry is backed by a strong local organisation in Tipperary, known informally as &quot;Team Lowry&quot;.

Lowry was re-elected to represent Tipperary North at the 2011 general election, heading the poll on the 1st count with 14,010 votes. He was elected again, for Tipperary, at the 2016 general election. He voted for Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on 6 May 2016. Shortly after Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl confirmed the result, Lowry was seen to offer a handshake to Kenny.

====2025 Speaking rights row====
Following the 2024 Irish general election Lowry led a group of independent TDs in negotiations with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on government formation leading to the agreement of a programme for government on 15 January 2025. Lowry announced that the group were &quot;in this for 5 years…We’re a strong, cohesive, united group&quot;. Despite his explicit support for the government, the appointment of members of the Independents group as Ministers of State in the government, and the coalition&#x27;s support for the election of Verona Murphy, a member of the group, as Ceann Comhairle, Lowry and two other members of the group sought to avail of opposition speaking time in the Dáil and to sit on the opposition benches. This was strongly opposed by all opposition parties and led to a stand off in the Dáil on its first sitting of 2025 which delayed the election of Micheál Martin as Taoiseach.

Lowry rejected a subsequent demand by opposition parties that he and the other Independents supporting the government would be excluded from Dáil Leaders&#x27; Questions time however, Ceann Comhairle, Verona Murphy later ruled that members of the Regional Independents Group could not form a Technical Group for the purposes of speaking rights saying she was not satisfied that Lowry and other members of the group were &quot;in Opposition&quot; as required by the relevant standing order. Lowry accepted the ruling by the Ceann Comhairle but called for &quot;new procedures&quot; to accommodate Independent TDs who are supportive of the government. He was critical of the Ceann Comhairle&#x27;s handling of the issue saying that the time taken to make the decision was &quot;excessive and caused problems for everyone&quot;.

==Business interests==
Lowry has directorships listed with the Companies Registration Office. He has two roles with Garuda Ltd, a manufacturer of electric domestic appliances; Abbeygreen Consulting, which involves construction work and special trades; and Gdlc Business Consultants Ltd., a business and management consultancy registered in Dublin. He also has an unlimited company called Glebeland Farm, which manages his bloodstock and livestock interests.

Lowry had some success with horse racing as a quarter-partner in the MALM partnership, but has in recent times taken to flat-race breeding.

Lowry owned a horse named Wedding Morn, though the price he paid for the horse is not known. The horse was covered by Coolmore&#x27;s Danehill Dancer, from the stable of John Magnier. He would have paid up to €75,000 to have the horse covered. Wedding Morn was delivered of three foals, including one called Probably, and the three were sold for a total of €410,000 by Lowry between 2009 and 2011. Lowry sold Wedding Morn in 2012 for €361,849.

==Moriarty Tribunal: investigation and results==
One of the remits of the Moriarty Tribunal, which sat from 1997 to 2011, was the investigation of payments to Lowry. In early 2007 Lowry announced that he had made a full and final settlement of all outstanding payments with the Revenue Commissioners in response to the findings concerning his tax evasion. His company Garuda had to pay €1.2 million after a Revenue audit. He also paid almost €200,000 to settle his personal taxes.

In March 2011 the second and final report from the Moriarty Tribunal found that, during his time as Communications Minister, Michael Lowry assisted businessman Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s consortium Esat Digifone in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s which ultimately made O&#x27;Brien one of the richest men in Ireland.

It concluded &quot;beyond doubt&quot; that Lowry gave what it termed &quot;substantive information to Denis O&#x27;Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the licence&quot;. The Tribunal report found that Lowry, displayed &quot;an appreciable interest&quot; in the process and had &quot;irregular interactions with interested parties at its most sensitive stages&quot;. It also found that one of Lowry&#x27;s interventions, which cut the selection process to the advantage of Esat, was &quot;disgraceful&quot; and &quot;insidious&quot;, and that he had misled the Government, his party leader John Bruton and his own civil servants to influence the selection process in Esat&#x27;s favour.

The tribunal also found that Lowry sought to procure unwarranted rent increases that over a seven-year period would have benefited businessman Ben Dunne. Lowry sought to influence the outcome of an arbitration being conducted in 1995 in relation to the rent payable by the then state-owned Telecom Éireann for Marlborough House to a company owned and controlled by Dunne. The report said that the matter was &quot;profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking&quot;.

The report also summarised the cumulative payments made to Lowry, and says &quot;In aggregating the known payments from Denis O&#x27;Brien to Michael Lowry, it is apposite to note that, between the granting of the second GSM licence to Esat Digifone in May 1996, and the transmission of £420,000 sterling to complete the purchase of the latter of Lowry&#x27;s English properties in December 1999, O&#x27;Brien had made or facilitated payments to Lowry of £147,000 sterling, £300,000 sterling and a benefit equivalent to a payment in the form of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s support for a loan of £420,000 sterling.&quot;

Lowry had addressed the Dáil saying that if he had been trying to hide a lot of money he would have &quot;put it in an offshore account&quot;, implying that no such account existed. The Tribunal found that he actually had at least four such accounts that he used for the purpose of evading tax, and had not disclosed these accounts to the previous McCracken Tribunal.

Lowry rejected the Moriarty report, claiming that it was flawed and that the assumptions and conclusions that Justice Moriarty arrived at were totally baseless. Nonetheless, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Bureau of Fraud were called in on 29 March 2011 to begin investigating his finances, given that his €1.4 million settlement with the Revenue Commissioners did not grant him immunity from prosecution.

On 31 March 2011, following the Moriarty Report&#x27;s publication, the Dáil passed an all-party motion calling on Lowry to voluntarily resign his seat.

==&quot;Lowry v. Sam Smyth&quot;==
Lowry launched a defamation lawsuit against &quot;Irish Independent&quot; journalist Sam Smyth in 2010, over an article Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal as well as comments Smyth had made on a TV3 show describing Lowry as having been &quot;caught with his hand in the till&quot;. Smyth defended the defamation claim, stating he &quot;did not call Michael Lowry TD a thief, but did believe he was a liar and a tax cheat&quot;. Lowry&#x27;s defamation lawsuit was thrown out in the Circuit court, and again on appeal to the High Court. High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns noted that Lowry &quot;did not dispute that he engaged in tax fraud&quot;, and ordered Lowry to pay Smyth&#x27;s legal costs.

==Undeclared land interest==
It emerged in October 2012 that Lowry owned land in Wigan which he had failed to declare in his register of members&#x27; interests. Between 2001 and 2003 the 25-acre site had been owned by Liam Carroll and Vineacre Ltd, a UK property company owned by him and Lowry. Vineacre Ltd was removed from the title in 2003 and Lowry declared his Vineacre interest until the company was dissolved in 2008. The land then became Lowry&#x27;s and Carroll&#x27;s in their own names, but he failed to declare his interest from 2008 onwards.

On 6 November 2012, Lowry amended his declaration to the Oireachtas to include the land interest, despite claiming previously that the land was &quot;worthless&quot;. An unprecedented 380 complaints were made by members of the public in relation to the scandal, partly prompted by an article written by author Elaine Byrne. According to rules, the property must be worth more than €13,000 to be declared an interest. Lowry claimed the complaints were part of an &quot;orchestrated campaign&quot; against him.

As of December 2012, the probe into Lowry&#x27;s failure to declare the land interest had been transferred to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO).

==Relationship with Kevin Phelan==

In March 2013, Northern Ireland land scout Kevin Phelan revealed that Lowry had made payments to him in 2002, of which only half had been disclosed to the Moriarty Tribunal. The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; released a secret recording of a telephone conversation made by Phelan, in which Lowry asks for nothing to be revealed about the payment to the tribunal. This was also broadcast on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;. In November 2015, it was announced that Lowry had launched High Court proceedings against INM in relation to the tapes.

==Tax affairs==
Lowry availed himself of the Tax Amnesty in 1993. He made a settlement with the Revenue again in 2003. In 2007 he paid a settlement of €192,000, which was due to the emergence of secret payments to him by businessman Ben Dunne. His company Garuda Limited made a settlement of €1.1m in 2005. In 2014 he faced five charges, including knowingly completing incorrect tax returns on a number of dates between 2003 and 2007. In 2018 he was found guilty on one of the charges, relating to a €372,000 payment received in 2002 but not recorded until 2006.

==State board appointments lobbying==
In January 2015 it was revealed that he lobbied Taoiseach Enda Kenny to have his female former press adviser reappointed to a State board. Lowry passed a note to the Taoiseach in the Dáil chamber asking him to consider re-appointing Valerie O&#x27;Reilly, who runs her own successful public relations agency, to the board of the National Transport Authority (NTA). The note read &quot;Taoiseach, would you please consider re-appointing Valerie O&#x27;Reilly to the board of the NTA. A woman, bright, intelligent and not bad looking either!&quot; Her initial appointment by the previous government in March 2010 provoked charges of cronyism. The incident came just three months after Kenny and Fine Gael were engulfed in another cronyism scandal involving John McNulty and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The then Fianna Fáil senator Averil Power expressed surprise at the tone of the note, and said: &quot;She probably does have strong business credentials, but to be referred to in this &quot;Father Ted&quot; &#x27;lovely girls&#x27; sort of way is every women&#x27;s worst nightmare. It also shows that we need far greater transparency when it comes to State board appointments&quot;.

Lowry was also revealed to have lobbied Minister for Transport Paschal Donohoe on the same matter. Donohoe told journalists at UCD that he had been &quot;briefly&quot; approached by Lowry. Lowry himself confirmed he had spoken to Donohoe in the Seanad chamber&#x27;s anteroom. &quot;I had been following a debate on a health-related issue in the Seanad and, out of courtesy, I informed Mr Donohoe, when I met him, that I had sent a note to the Taoiseach on the reappointment&quot;, claimed Lowry. When asked to respond to media coverage of the affair, Lowry said: &quot;It is a load of nonsense and, frankly, more irritating than anything else.&quot;

==2019 local elections==
In May 2019, five members of Lowry&#x27;s political group (&quot;Team Lowry&quot;), including his son Micheál, were elected as independents at the Tipperary County Council election, three had been elected in 2014.

<doc id="477160" wikidata="Q5364017" url="?curid=477160" title="Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow">
<text>Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), was a case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The lawsuit, originally filed as Newdow v. United States Congress, Elk Grove Unified School District, et al. in 2000, led to a 2002 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance are an endorsement of religion and therefore violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The words had been added by a 1954 act of Congress that changed the phrase &quot;one nation indivisible&quot; into &quot;one nation under God, indivisible&quot;. After an initial decision striking the congressionally added &quot;under God&quot;, the superseding opinion on denial of rehearing &quot;en banc&quot; was more limited, holding that compelled recitation of the language by school teachers to students was invalid.

On June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court held Michael Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, did not have standing to bring the suit on his daughter&#x27;s behalf. The mother was previously given sole legal custody of the daughter. The Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision was thus reversed as a matter of procedural law, so it did not consider the constitutional question raised by the case.

On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in favor of Newdow. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order enjoining the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in the pledge with &quot;under God.&quot; The case was later appealed to the Ninth Circuit under &quot;Newdow v. Carey&quot; and was reversed.

==U.S. District Court Case==
Michael Newdow, a Sacramento, California attorney and emergency medicine physician, filed suit in March 2000 against the Elk Grove Unified School District. Newdow sued as the &quot;next friend&quot; on behalf of his daughter, who was enrolled in the Elk Grove public schools. He said the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion and that, as such, the daily recitation of the Pledge with the offending words interfered with his right to inculcate his daughter with his religious beliefs.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter A. Nowinski found the Pledge was constitutional. The District Court accepted the magistrate&#x27;s finding and dismissed the case on June 21, 2000. Newdow then appealed.

==U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit==
The Ninth Circuit issued three opinions in the case, as outlined below.

===&quot;Newdow I&quot; – June 26, 2002===

A three-judge panel of the court unanimously found Newdow had standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter. On the merits of the case, the court reversed the trial court decision on a 2-to-1 vote, on June 26, 2002. The majority opinion was written by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin with a partial concurrence and partial dissent written by Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez.

In reviewing the case, the court applied the Lemon Test, the Endorsement Test, and the Coercion Test. In doing so, the Court concluded recitation of the Pledge with the words &quot;under God&quot; included violated the Establishment Clause.

Fernandez asserted in his partial dissent that the religious content of the &quot;under God&quot; addition is so small that it is de minimis—so trivial as to be properly beneath judicial notice.

Public and congressional reaction to the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision was decidedly negative. About 150 Members of Congress stood on the front steps of the Capitol and recited the Pledge including the words &quot;under God&quot;; and the Senate passed a non-binding resolution affirming the presence of &quot;under God&quot; by a unanimous vote.

===&quot;Newdow II&quot; – December 4, 2002===

After the June opinion was issued, Sandra Banning—the mother of the child in question (Newdow and Banning were not married) filed a motion to intervene or, alternatively, to dismiss Newdow&#x27;s complaint. She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a California court order granted her exclusive &quot;legal&quot; custody of the child, including the sole right to represent her legal interests and make all decisions about her education and welfare. Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God. Banning said she believed her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her father&#x27;s atheist views. Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughter&#x27;s sole legal custodian, that it was not in the child&#x27;s interest to be a party to Newdow&#x27;s lawsuit.

The court&#x27;s second published opinion noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but the judges unanimously concluded that Banning&#x27;s sole legal custody of the child did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article Three standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child. The court further held that under California law Newdow retained the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradicted the mother&#x27;s, and that Banning&#x27;s objections as sole legal custodian did not defeat Newdow&#x27;s right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

===&quot;Newdow III&quot; – February 28, 2003===

Defendants sought en banc review. This was denied and an amended order and opinion was issued in February 2003. The amended opinion omitted the initial opinion&#x27;s discussion of Newdow&#x27;s standing to challenge the 1954 Act and declined to determine whether Newdow was entitled to declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of that Act.

On September 11, 2003, Newdow was awarded partial custody of his daughter, including joint legal custody.

===Quotations and legal detail===

From the 9th circuit hearing:
* Decided – the 1954 insertion of &quot;under God&quot; was made &quot;to recognize a Supreme Being&quot; and advance religion at a time &quot;when the government was publicly inveighing against atheistic communism&quot;—a fact which (according to the court) the federal government did not dispute. The court also noted that when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the act which added the phrase &quot;under God,&quot; he also announced &quot;From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty.&quot;
* Judge Alfred Goodwin from the 9th Circuit remarked: &quot;A profession that we are a nation &#x27;under God&#x27; is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation &#x27;under Jesus,&#x27; a nation &#x27;under Vishnu,&#x27; a nation &#x27;under Zeus,&#x27; or a nation &#x27;under no god,&#x27; because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion.&quot;

==U.S. Supreme Court==

On March 24, 2004 the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral argument in the case to consider two questions: (1) whether Newdow had standing as a noncustodial parent to challenge the School District&#x27;s policy on recitation of the Pledge, and (2) if so, whether the policy offends the First Amendment.

Justice Antonin Scalia recused himself from the case after a request by Newdow that cited Scalia&#x27;s disapproval of the Ninth Circuit decision in a public speech. According to Scalia, many lower courts often misinterpret the Establishment Clause, extending its proscription of religiosity in the public sphere.

On June 14, 2004, in an opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, five of the remaining eight justices – Stevens, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, David Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg – found Michael Newdow lacked standing to bring the case as &quot;next friend&quot; to his daughter, because Sandra Banning had sole legal custody of the child at the time – including exclusive authority over the girl&#x27;s education. The majority also found that Michael Newdow lacked prudential standing to bring the case on behalf of himself due to the custody arrangement. This resulted in reversal of the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision as a matter of procedural law.

The other three justices concurred in the judgment reversing the Ninth Circuit, but dissented on the issue of standing. They found Michael Newdow &quot;did&quot; have standing to bring the suit. Thus, they proceeded to examine the constitutional question, and in doing so they found it did not offend the Constitution. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote an opinion in which the other two joined in part; and both justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote their own separate opinions.

Rehnquist&#x27;s opinion asserts the term &quot;under God&quot; does not endorse or establish religion but it actually asserts that the term merely acknowledges the nation&#x27;s religious heritage, in particular the role of religion for the Founding Fathers of the United States. Thus, according to the opinion, the Pledge is a secular act rather than an act of indoctrination in religion or expression of religious devotion.

Justice Thomas, by contrast, asserts that finding the Pledge unconstitutional is an unjustifiable expansion of the meaning of &quot;coercion&quot; as that term is used in legal precedent: to prohibit compelling students in a &quot;fair and real sense&quot; by &quot;subtle and indirect public and peer pressure&quot; (see, &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot;) to be prayerful, as well as prohibiting actual coercion by force of law and threat of penalty. Further, he argues that the Establishment Clause ought not be considered a right that attaches to individuals pursuant to the Incorporation Doctrine, because he believes the clause only prohibits interference by the federal government in the right of individual states to establish their own official religions – notwithstanding current majority opinion on the question is against states having such a right, as a result of the Incorporation Doctrine.

In a concurring opinion Justice O&#x27;Connor referenced the endorsement test and wrote: &quot;When a court confronts a challenge to government-sponsored speech or displays, I continue to believe that the endorsement test “captures the essential command of the Establishment Clause, namely, that government must not make a person’s religious beliefs relevant to his or her standing in the political community by conveying a message ‘that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.’ ” &quot;County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter&quot;, 492 U. S. 573, 627 (1989) (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (quoting &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot;, 472 U. S. 38, 70 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment)).

<text>Doreen Bird MA FISTD ARAD (27 January 1928 – 4 February 2004) was a British dance teacher and founder of the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in Sidcup, Kent (now Southeast London). She was a fellow, examiner, lecturer, committee and council member of the ISTD, life member of the RAD, and Honorary MA. Prior to her death from Leukaemia in 2004, she had been studying towards a Ph.D. As well as being a respected dance figure in the United Kingdom, Bird also travelled the World as a lecturer and adjudicator specialising in dance and musical theatre. The college which Bird founded is now recognised Internationally as a centre of excellence for dance and performing arts, with its students working worldwide in high-profile areas of the performing industry including West End and Broadway theatre.

==Professional accomplishments==

===Dance College===
In 1945, Bird founded the Doreen Bird School of Dance, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Bird College of Dance, Music &amp; Theatre Performance. Bird initially taught her students in her parents&#x27; living room then a local church hall, before opening a full-time performing arts course at permanent premises in Sidcup. This became the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts and Bird remained principal of the college until her retirement in 1998, when the name Bird College was adopted under its new principal. The college is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading institutions for specialist dance and musical theatre training, with many ex-students of the college appearing in dance and theatre Worldwide including West End and Broadway theatre. The college now operates a range of courses including the National Diploma in Musical Theatre and the BA (Hons) Degree in Dance &amp; Theatre Performances, both courses being established during Bird&#x27;s tenure as principal. The college has continued to expand since Bird died, becoming the first college of its kind in the UK to offer an MA Degree (by research), as subject specialist provider for the University of Greenwich. Since October 2007, the college has also been the official provider of music and dance services for the London Borough of Bexley.

===Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing===
Doreen Bird was a member of the ISTD, an international dance examination board based in London, England. As a life member of the organisation, she served as a teacher, examiner, lecturer, committee and council member. She was appointed an examiner of the Modern Theatre Branch in 1957, National Dance Branch in 1958 and Imperial Ballet Branch in 1964, travelling the world as a representative of the society. Bird served as a member of the ISTD Grand Council from 1970 to 1975, and became a committee member of the Modern Theatre Branch in 1970, a post which she held for sixteen years until 1986. During her time as a committee member of the ISTD, Bird was influential in the examination of dance and the modernisation of the organisations syllabus and approach to teaching young dancers. As a member of the Modern Theatre Branch, Bird helped to compile all the society&#x27;s new Major examination syllabi for Modern Dance and Tap Dance. Much of this work is still used today, although the syllabi are often revised to keep up to date with current trends in dance.

<text>The Kāpiti Coast District (officially the Kapiti Coast District), is a local government district of the Wellington Region in the lower North Island of New Zealand, north of Wellington City. The district is named after Kapiti Island, a prominent island offshore.

The population of the district is concentrated in the chain of coastal settlements along State Highway One: Ōtaki, Te Horo, Waikanae, Paraparaumu, Raumati Beach, Raumati South, and Paekākāriki. Paraparaumu is the most populous of these towns and the commercial and administrative centre. Much of the rural land is given over to horticulture; market gardens are common along the highway between the settlements. The area available for agriculture and settlement is narrow and coastal. Much of the eastern part of the district is within the Tararua Forest Park, which covers the rugged Tararua Range, with peaks rising to over .

== Geography ==

The Kāpiti Coast District stretches from Ōtaki in the north to Paekākāriki in the south. It includes the towns of Te Horo, Waikanae, Paraparaumu, Raumati Beach, Raumati South, and smaller localities such as Maungakotukutuku, Otaihanga, and Peka Peka. It extends from the Tasman Sea coast to the top of the Tararua Range. Kapiti Island, a prominent offshore feature, is part of the district.

The district is not generally considered part of the Wellington metropolitan area, being distant from Wellington City, Porirua and the Hutt Valley, which make up the nucleus of the area. Still, Waikanae is considered by many to be the absolute northernmost point Wellington can be considered to reach as a city. Many residents travel into Wellington each day for work, and the district is a popular weekend destination for the people of the Wellington Region. The town of Paraparaumu, considered the pivot of the district, is located about 55 km north of Wellington.

The area has an oceanic climate with moderate temperature swings between seasons, resulting in warm summers and mild winters without any severe heat waves or cold spells.

== History ==
The district was occupied by the Muaūpoko Māori tribe up to the 19th century. Ngāti Toa, led by chief Te Rauparaha, migrated to the district in the 1820s. Te Rauparaha established a base on Kapiti Island, from where he was able to launch attacks on other tribes during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. Around this time, Europeans began whaling in the area, and on 16 October 1839, William Wakefield of the New Zealand Company arrived in the Kapiti region to purchase land for permanent European settlement. Te Rauparaha sold him land in the Nelson and Golden Bay area.

European settlement of the Kāpiti Coast only took place on a significant scale after the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) opened its railway line from Wellington to Longburn, just south of Palmerston North. The line was opened in 1886, with the final spike driven in on the Kāpiti Coast at Otaihanga. Paekākāriki was quickly established as a significant steam locomotive depot due to the need to swap locomotives at the location; powerful, heavy locomotives were required to handle trains over the rugged section from Wellington to Paekākāriki, while lighter, faster locomotives were more suited to the relatively flat terrain north of Paekākāriki. In 1908, the WMR was purchased by the New Zealand Railways Department, who incorporated the line into the North Island Main Trunk railway.

In June 1940, the Wellington-Paekākāriki section was electrified as electric locomotives provided better motive power. This meant trains would swap from steam (and later diesel-electric) to electric traction in Paekākāriki, and it retained its status as a significant locomotive depot. It also became the northern terminus of the Wellington commuter railway network until 8 May 1983, when it was extended to Paraparaumu. In February 2011, electrification reached Waikanae, which became the new terminus.

During World War II, Queen Elizabeth Park – a large tract of parkland between Raumati South and Paekākāriki – was the location of two United States Army and Marines camps, McKay and Russell. US troops were stationed at the camps in 1942–44 prior to being sent into combat in the Pacific Ocean theatre.

After World War II, Wellington&#x27;s Rongotai Airport was closed due to safety reasons in 1947 and Kapiti Coast Airport became the main airport for the Wellington Region. In 1949, it was New Zealand&#x27;s busiest airport and helped to stimulate growth on the Kāpiti Coast. The Wellington International Airport was opened in 1959 and Paraparaumu Airport never regained its status, with some of its land sold for residential development in the 1990s and 2000s.

== Name and etymology ==
Although &quot;Kapiti Coast District&quot; is the official name of the district, the council uses the spelling &quot;Kāpiti&quot; for its name. Despite sharing the same spelling, the name is unrelated to the Māori word for &quot;cabbage&quot; ().

In April 2010 the council starting using macrons in the spelling of Kāpiti, Ōtaki and Paekākāriki in council papers, publications, maps and signage. Despite this, the council did not make an application to the New Zealand Geographic Board to add a macron to the name of the district as the macron is used to aid pronunciation rather than spelling.

In a back and forth manner, vandals have repeatedly added and removed macrons from signage in the district.

== Administration ==
===District Council===
The parts of the district south of the Waikanae River were originally part of the now defunct Hutt County. The Kapiti Borough Council was carved from it in 1973.

In New Zealand&#x27;s local government reforms of 1989, the borough council was replaced by the Kapiti Coast District Council, and the area under its jurisdiction expanded northwards to include Waikanae and Ōtaki, which had been part of the Horowhenua County. The council, now styled &quot;Kāpiti Coast District Council&quot;, is a territorial authority elected by residents every three years. It consists of a mayor and 10 councillors. Two councillors are elected for the Paraparaumu ward, one each for the Ōtaki, Paekākāriki-Raumati and Waikanae wards, and five are elected at-large. Kapiti Island is part of the Paraparaumu ward.

====Community boards====
The Kāpiti Coast District Council has created five local community boards, under the provisions of Part 4 of the Local Government Act 2002, covering the district:

*The Paekākāriki Community Board representing the area including Paekākāriki, Emerald Glen and Whareroa Road in the north;
*The Paraparaumu Community Board, representing the area from Paraparaumu through to Otaihanga;
*The Raumati Community Board, representing the area including Raumati Beach and Raumati South;
*The Waikanae Community Board, representing the area from Waikanae Downs in the south through to Peka Peka in the north;
*The Ōtaki Community Board represents the area including north of Marycrest, Te Horo, Ōtaki North to Forest Lakes.

Community boards are primarily advocates for their local area, and they also administer community grant funding.

===Regional Council===
Greater Wellington Regional Council is responsible for regional governance of the district and the wider region, including public transport, water and environmental management.

==Economy and transport==
The Kāpiti Coast is well known for its cheeses and other products from Lindale. Light industry is focused in Paraparaumu and Ōtaki, with small clusters in Waikanae and Raumati.

Many of the Kāpiti Coast&#x27;s residents are not employed in the area. Instead, they commute to jobs in Wellington. Transdev operates electric commuter trains along a portion of the North Island Main Trunk Railway referred to as the Kapiti Line on behalf of Metlink (the Greater Wellington public transport brand), and the KiwiRail Capital Connection commuter train from Palmerston North to Wellington provides a service for commuters north of the electric terminus in Waikanae. Metlink also provides regular local bus services throughout the Kāpiti Coast, operated by Uzabus.

In February 2017, an 18 km (11 mi) long expressway diversion from Mackays Crossing north of Paekākāriki to just north of Peka Peka, was opened to enable State Highway 1 to bypass developed urban areas. An extension to just north of Ōtaki opened in December 2022.

State Highway One connects the Kāpiti Coast to Wellington. Before the long-mooted Transmission Gully Motorway opened in March 2022, the road (now re-designated State Highway 59) was a narrow, highly congested coastal highway and has been subject to occasional closure due to landslides.

The district is on the North Island Main Trunk railway line (NIMT) and served as far north as Waikanae by suburban passenger trains on the Kapiti Line, one of Wellington&#x27;s three Metlink commuter rail links. There are also commuter bus services.

The small Kapiti Coast Airport is sandwiched between Paraparaumu (to the north) and Raumati (to the south). With three runways (one of which is now closed), it once served as the main airport of the Wellington region, but was until recently used mainly by aeroclubs. In 2011 scheduled commercial flights from Kapiti to Auckland resumed. It also has daily scheduled flights across Cook Strait to Nelson and Blenheim. After Air New Zealand withdrew air services in April 2018, Air Chathams announced that they would be launching flights to Auckland from August 2018. Sounds Air also operates from the airport, and it is used for flight training and for private and hobby flights.

<doc id="477167" wikidata="Q735593" url="?curid=477167" title="Conor Cruise O'Brien">
<text>Donal Conor David Dermot Donat Cruise O&#x27;Brien (3 November 1917 – 18 December 2008), often nicknamed &quot;The Cruiser&quot;, was an Irish diplomat, politician, writer, historian and academic, who served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1973 to 1977, a Senator for Dublin University from 1977 to 1979, a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North-East constituency from 1969 to 1977, and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from January 1973 to March 1973.

His opinion of Britain&#x27;s role in Ireland subsequent to the partition of the island and the independence of the Free State in 1921 changed during the 1970s, in response to the outbreak of The Troubles. He now saw opposing nationalist and unionist traditions as irreconcilable, and switched from a nationalist to a unionist view of Irish politics and history, and from opposition to support for partition. Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s outlook was radical and seldom orthodox. He summarised his position as intending &quot;to administer an electric shock to the Irish psyche&quot;.

Internationally, though a long-standing member of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, he opposed in person the African National Congress&#x27;s academic boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Views that he espoused during and after the 1970s contrasted with those he articulated during the 1950s and 1960s.

During his 1945–1961 career as a civil servant, Cruise O&#x27;Brien promoted the government&#x27;s anti-partition campaign. In the 1960s he was associated with the &#x27;New Left&#x27; and opposition to US military involvement in Viet Nam. At the 1969 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin North-East. He served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, with responsibility for broadcasting, between 1973 and 1977 in a coalition government. During those years he was also the Labour Party&#x27;s Northern Ireland spokesman. Cruise O&#x27;Brien was later known primarily as an author and as an &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; columnist.

==Early life==
Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien was born at 44 Leinster Road, Rathmines, Dublin, to Francis (&quot;Frank&quot;) Cruise O&#x27;Brien and the former Kathleen Sheehy. Frank was a journalist with the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; and &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspapers, and had edited an essay written 50 years earlier by William Lecky concerning the influence of the clergy on Irish politics. Kathleen was a teacher of the Irish language. She was the daughter of David Sheehy, a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and organiser of the Irish National Land League. She had three sisters, Hanna, Margaret and Mary. Hanna&#x27;s husband, the well-known pacifist and supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, was executed by firing squad on the orders of Captain J.C Bowen Colthurst during the 1916 Easter Rising. Soon afterwards Mary&#x27;s husband, Thomas Kettle, an officer of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in the First World War, was killed during the Battle of the Somme. These women, Hanna and Kathleen in particular, were a major influence on Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s upbringing, alongside Hanna&#x27;s son, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s father died in 1927. He wanted Conor educated, like Conor&#x27;s cousin Owen, in Sandford Park School that had a predominantly Protestant ethos, a wish Kathleen honoured. despite objections from Catholic clergy. Cruise O&#x27;Brien subsequently attended Trinity College Dublin, which played the British national anthem until 1939. While others stood, he and Sheehy-Skeffington sat in protest on such occasions. Cruise O&#x27;Brien was elected a scholar in Modern Languages at Trinity in 1937 and was editor of Trinity&#x27;s weekly, &quot;&quot;.

His first wife, Christine Foster, from a Belfast Presbyterian family, was, like her father, a member of the Gaelic League. Her parents, Alexander (Alec) Roulston Foster and Anne (Annie) Lynd, were, in Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s description, &quot;Home Rulers; a very advanced position for any Protestants in the period&quot;. Alec Foster was at the time headmaster of Belfast Royal Academy; he was later a founding member of the Wolfe Tone Society, and was a strong supporter of the Irish Anti-Apartheid movement. He was a former Ulster, Ireland and British &amp; Irish Lions rugby player, having captained Ireland three times between 1912 and 1914. Cruise O&#x27;Brien and Christine Foster were married in a registry office in 1939. The couple had three children: Donal, Fedelma, and Kathleen (Kate), who died in 1998. The marriage ended in divorce after 20 years.

In 1962, Cruise O&#x27;Brien married the Irish-language writer and poet Máire Mhac an tSaoi in a Roman Catholic church. Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s divorce, though contrary to Roman Catholic teaching, was not an issue because that church did not recognise the validity of his 1939 civil wedding. He referred to this action, which in effect formally de-recognised the legitimacy of his former wife and their children, as &quot;hypocritical ... and otherwise distasteful, but I took it, as preferable to the alternatives&quot;. Mac an tSaoi was five years his junior, and the daughter of Seán MacEntee, who was Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) at the time. The couple subsequently adopted two children of Irish-African parentage, a son (Patrick) and a daughter (Margaret).

==Department of External Affairs==
Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s university education led to a career in the public service, most notably in the Department of External Affairs. He achieved distinction as managing director of the state-run Irish News Agency and later as part of the fledgling Irish delegation to the United Nations. He later claimed he was something of an anomalous iconoclast in post-1922 Irish politics, particularly in the context of Fianna Fáil governments under Éamon de Valera.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien wrote that the then Secretary of the department, Joseph P. Walshe, might well have considered that Cruise O&#x27;Brien was &quot;no fit person to be a member of Catholic Ireland&#x27;s Department of External Affairs&quot;. Cruise O&#x27;Brien attributed his appointment &quot;to a decision taken at a higher level. Under God, there was only one higher level. This consisted of Eamon de Valera, then Minister for External Affairs as well as Taoiseach.&quot; Cruise O&#x27;Brien speculated that de Valera&#x27;s Catholicism may have been conditioned by his excommunication during the Civil War of 1922/3, that he may have felt that Walshe had been too close to the previous government, and that he may have been conscious of the nationalist credentials of the Sheehy family, notably Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s great-uncle, Father Eugene Sheehy, who had been parish priest of Bruree during de Valera&#x27;s formative years. De Valera later wrote of Father Sheehy, &quot;&quot; (It was he who taught me patriotism).

Cruise O&#x27;Brien wrote of his entry into the public service: &quot;The time when I joined the Department of Finance was the first time, since my First Communion, that I found myself in a working environment which was mainly – indeed almost entirely – Catholic&quot;. As he admitted, his non-belief did not impede his career, which ended at ambassadorial level. He observed,
In the Department of External Affairs, during the 1948–1951 inter-party government, he served under Seán MacBride, son of John MacBride and Maud Gonne, republican and former IRA Chief of Staff. Cruise O&#x27;Brien was particularly vocal in opposition to partition during the 1940s and 1950s, as part of his official duties.

==Secondment in Congo==
He came to prominence in 1961, after his secondment from Ireland&#x27;s UN delegation as a special representative to Dag Hammarskjöld, Secretary General of the United Nations, in the Katanga region of the newly independent Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Cruise O&#x27;Brien accused a combination of British, French and white Rhodesian elements of attempting to partition off Katanga as a pro-Western client state. He used military force to oppose a combination of western mercenaries and Katangan forces.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien arrived in Élisabethville (modern Lubumbashi) on 14 June 1961, making him the UN&#x27;s point man for dealing with Moïse Tshombe, the leader of the self-proclaimed independent État du Katanga. The Kasaï Baluba people who formed the majority of the people in northern Katanga were solid supporters of a united Congo, and were the subjects of a ruthless campaign of repression waged by the white mercenaries hired by Tshombe, together with the Katangese gendarmerie. The UN refugee camps were soon overcrowded with thousands of Kasai Baluba people who fled into the refugee camps for their safety. From the viewpoint of O&#x27;Brien and other UN personnel, the sooner the crisis was ended, the sooner the refugees could go home. On 28 August 1961, Operation Rum Punch was launched to remove the mercenaries from Katanga as the first step towards reintegrating Katanga into the Congo. On 11 September, Mahmoud Khiary, the chief of the UN mission, gave O&#x27;Brien orders to arrest several leading figures within the Etat du Katanga. On 13 September 1961, Operation Morthor was launched, which led Cruise O&#x27;Brien to assert prematurely at a press conference that the secession of Katanga was at an end. Tshombe was ordered to be arrested, but he was able to escape via the British consul in Élisabethville to the British colony of Northern Rhodesia (modern Zambia) from whence he returned to Katanga.

===Siege of Jadotville===

In September 1961, a company of 155 Irish UN troops (&quot;A&quot; Company, 35th Battalion, Irish Army), was surrounded by a force of heavily armed Gendarmerie and mercenaries outnumbering them 20-to-one in Jadotville. The Irish soldiers, many of them still in their teens, were lightly armed, short of ammunition and supplies, and unprepared for the situation. They had been sent to the newly independent Republic of Congo on what was supposed to be a peacekeeping mission but were ordered to the offensive by the UN&#x27;s most senior diplomat on the ground, Cruise O&#x27;Brien, acting on the instructions of the Secretary General, who wanted the Katanga problem solved before the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, as his career was on the line.

The Irish troops held out for six days before they ran out of bullets and drinking water. When water finally reached them, it came in old petrol cans that had not been cleaned, making it undrinkable. The troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy force but suffered no fatalities themselves. After their surrender, they spent just over one month in captivity unsure of their fate, and when they arrived back in Ireland, were dismayed and deeply hurt to learn that the UN and their own government were anxious to sweep the episode under the carpet to protect the reputation and to conceal the failures of the UN in preparing for combat and liberating Company A.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien wrote immediately about his experiences in &quot;The Observer&quot; of London and in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 10 and 17 December 1961. Armed with the archive material, one expert concluded Hammarskjöld &quot;knew in advance that the UN was about to take action in Katanga and he authorised that action&quot;. This is contradicted in a 2022 book on the Congo crisis by historian Wilhelm Agrell.

===Dismissal===
Faced with the failure of Operation Morthor, Hammarskjöld was on his way to Ndola to meet Tshombe to discuss a ceasefire, but was killed when his airplane crashed during the journey. Cruise O&#x27;Brien wrote: &quot;in Élisabethville I do not think there was anyone who believed that his death was an accident&quot;.

A UN crisis ensued, and Cruise O&#x27;Brien was forced to step down simultaneously from his UN position and the Irish diplomatic service in late 1961. He went public immediately with his version of events, writing simultaneously in &quot;The Observer&quot; (London) and the &quot;New York Times&quot; that, &quot;My resignation from the United Nations and from the Irish foreign service is a result of British government policy&quot;. 

Michael Ignatieff asserted that Hammarskjöld had misjudged O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s abilities as UN representative and that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s use of military force provided the Soviets and the US with ammunition in their campaign against the UN Secretary General and against UN actions in opposition to the interests of the big powers. Faced with the complexities of the political situation of the United Nations in the Congo, O&#x27;Brien had failed to understand and in turn exceeded the authority granted to ONUC by the Secretary-General and the Security Council. Hammarskjöld first learned of the operation via press dispatch in Accra — after the operation had already begun — and his initial reaction was to dismiss the report as erroneous since it was clearly in violation of his instructions.

==Opposition to the Vietnam War==
After Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s recall from UN service and his resignation from the Irish civil service, he served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana. He resigned after he fell out with the Chancellor and President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, in 1965. He was initially sympathetic towards Nkrumah, who won Ghana&#x27;s independence from the British empire in 1957, but fell out with him due to his authoritarianism and his promotion of the ideology of &#x27;Nkrumahism&#x27;, in which all Ghanaians were expected to believe. Cruise O&#x27;Brien sought to protect academic freedom against Nkrumahism, saying in a speech before the students of the University of Ghana that all intellectuals have a duty to promote the truth and that &quot;These are not European values; these are universal values.&quot;

He was then appointed Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities at New York University, a position he held until 1969. During the 1960s O&#x27;Brien was an active opponent of US involvement in Vietnam. He supported the right of the Vietnamese people to use violence against US armed forces. At a 1967 Vietnam War symposium O&#x27;Brien clashed with Hannah Arendt, who had remarked, &quot;As to the Viet Cong terror, we cannot possibly agree with it&quot;. O&#x27;Brien responded, &quot;I think there is a distinction between the use of terror by oppressed peoples against the oppressors and their servants, in comparison with the use of terror by their oppressors in the interests of further oppression. I think there is a qualitative distinction there which we have the right to make.&quot;

Besides the Vietnam War, Cruise O&#x27;Brien opposed what he saw as the overtly too passive opposition of the U.S. government to the white supremacist governments of Rhodesia and South Africa, charging that all the reaction the U.S. government ever made was to politely deplore the policies of the two governments. In September 1967, he flew to the self-proclaimed Republic of Biafra to express his support for Ibo separatism. In articles in &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, he argued that there were important differences between the Republic of Biafra and the State of Katanga, and that there was no equivalence between the two breakaway states. He argued that Biafra represented the sincere wish of the Ibo people to leave Nigeria, while Katanga was a sham.

In December 1967, Cruise O&#x27;Brien was front-page news in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, which reported his arrest while demonstrating against the war in New York, and his being kicked by a policeman. He joked about the policeman who assaulted him: &quot;no prizes for guessing his ethnicity&quot;. In 1968, he campaigned for Senator Eugene McCarthy who sought the Democratic nomination in the presidential election of that year on a platform of ending the Vietnam War. In May of that year, Cruise O&#x27;Brien condemned police attacks on and harassment of the militant, armed, Black Panther Party.

Between January and March 1969, he offered refuge at his home in Howth to German socialist student leader, and anti-Vietnam War activist, Rudi Dutschke and his wife Gretchen. In April the previous year Dutschke had been shot and badly injured by a right-wing assassin in West Berlin, but was subsequently denied visas by a number of European countries, including Britain. During their stay, the Dutschkes were visited by their lawyer Horst Mahler, who tried and failed to persuade them to support him underground in the group that was to become the Red Army Faction (the &quot;Baader Meinhof Gang&quot;).

==Irish politics==
Cruise O&#x27;Brien returned to Ireland and in the 1969 general election was elected to Dáil Éireann as a member of the opposition Labour Party in Dublin North-East, taking the second of that constituency&#x27;s four seats behind Fianna Fail Minister for Finance Charles Haughey, whose probity in financial matters he questioned. He was appointed a member of the short-lived first delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament. After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael and Labour formed a coalition government under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, in which Cruise O&#x27;Brien was appointed as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.

After the outbreak of armed conflict in Northern Ireland in 1969, Cruise O&#x27;Brien developed a deep hostility to militant Irish republicanism and to Irish nationalists generally in Northern Ireland, which reversed the views that he articulated at the outset of the unrest. He also reversed his opposition to broadcasting censorship imposed by the previous government, by extending and vigorously enforcing censorship of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. In 1976, he specifically banned spokespersons for Sinn Féin and the Provisional Irish Republican Army from RTÉ. At the same time, he unsuccessfully attempted to have Britain&#x27;s BBC 1 broadcast on Ireland&#x27;s proposed second television channel, instead of allowing RTÉ to run it.

Two additional notable incidents affected Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s career as minister, besides his support for broadcasting censorship.

In August 1976, Bernard Nossiter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interviewed him on the passage of an Emergency Powers Bill. During the course of the interview, Cruise O&#x27;Brien revealed an intention to extend censorship beyond broadcasting. He wished to &quot;cleanse the culture&quot; of republicanism and said that he would like the bill to be used against teachers who allegedly glorified Irish revolutionaries. He also wanted it used against newspaper editors who published pro-republican or anti-British readers&#x27; letters. Cruise O&#x27;Brien mentioned &quot;The Irish Press&quot; as a newspaper against which he particularly hoped to use the legislation against and produced a file of &quot;Irish Press&quot; letters to the editor to which he took exception. Nossiter immediately informed &quot;The Irish Press&quot; editor Tim Pat Coogan of Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s intentions. Coogan printed Nossiter&#x27;s report (as did &quot;The Irish Times&quot;), republished the letters to which Cruise O&#x27;Brien objected and ran a number of strong editorials attacking Cruise O&#x27;Brien and the proposed legislation. The interview caused huge controversy and resulted in the modification of the measure appearing to target newspapers.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien also supported Garda Síochána brutality from 1973 to 1977, but that was not revealed by Cruise O&#x27;Brien until 1998 in his &quot;Memoir&quot;. In &quot;Memoir: My Life and Themes&quot;, Cruise O&#x27;Brien recalled a conversation with a detective who told him how the Gardaí had found out from a suspect the location of businessman Tiede Herrema, who had been kidnapped by group of maverick republicans in October 1975: &quot;the escort started asking him questions and when at first he refused to answer, they beat the shit out of him. Then he told them where Herrema was&quot;.&quot;/ Cruise O&#x27;Brien explained, &quot;I refrained from telling this story to [ministerial colleagues] Garret [FitzGerald] or Justin [Keating], because I thought it would worry them. It didn&#x27;t worry me&quot;. Elements of the Garda that engaged in beating false confessions out of suspects quickly became known as the &quot;Heavy Gang&quot;.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s constituency was re-drawn as part of his Labour colleague James Tully&#x27;s attempt as Minister for Local Government to design boundaries in the electoral interests of the coalition partners. The plan backfired. In the 1977 general election, he stood in Dublin Clontarf and was one of three ministers (the others being Justin Keating and Patrick Cooney) defeated in a rout of the outgoing administration. He was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann in 1977 for the Dublin University constituency. He was dropped as Labour&#x27;s Northern Ireland spokesperson. O&#x27;Brien resigned his seat in 1979 because of new commitments as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper in London.

==Editor-in-Chief at &quot;The Observer&quot;==
Between 1978 and 1981, Cruise O&#x27;Brien was editor-in-chief of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper in Britain. In 1979 he refused to publish an &quot;Observer&quot; article by Mary Holland, the paper&#x27;s Ireland correspondent. Holland, whose reporting won her a Journalist of the Year award, had been one of the first journalists to explain discrimination in Northern Ireland to a British audience. The article was a profile of Mary Nelis of Derry and dealt with her radicalisation as a result of the conflict. Cruise O&#x27;Brien objected and sent Holland a memo stating that the &quot;killing strain&quot; of Irish republicanism &quot;has a very high propensity to run in families and the mother is most often the carrier&quot;. The memo continued, &quot;It is a very serious weakness of your coverage of Irish affairs that you are a very poor judge of Irish Catholics. That gifted and talkative community includes some of the most expert conmen and conwomen in the world and I believe you have been conned&quot;. Holland was forced out of the newspaper by Cruise O&#x27;Brien. She later joined &quot;The Irish Times&quot; as a columnist. She also rejoined &quot;The Observer&quot; after Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s departure in 1981.

==Unionism==
In 1985, Cruise O&#x27;Brien supported unionist objections to the inter-governmental Anglo-Irish Agreement. In 1996 he joined Robert McCartney&#x27;s United Kingdom Unionist Party (UKUP) and was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum. In 1997, a successful libel action was brought against him by relatives of Bloody Sunday victims for alleging in a &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; article in 1997 that the marchers were &quot;Sinn Féin activists operating for the IRA&quot;. Cruise O&#x27;Brien opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and opposed allowing Sinn Féin into government in Northern Ireland. He wrote that he was &quot;glad to be an ally ... in defence of the Union&quot; with the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Free Presbyterian Church and of the Democratic Unionist Party. In 1968 O&#x27;Brien had referred to Paisley as a &quot;hate merchant&quot;. He also predicted, mistakenly, that Paisley would not enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin. O&#x27;Brien later resigned from the UKUP after his book &quot;Memoir: My Life and Themes&quot; called on Unionists to consider the benefits of a united Ireland in order to thwart Sinn Féin. In 2005 he rejoined the Irish Labour Party. Cruise O&#x27;Brien defended his harsh attitudes and actions towards Irish republicans, saying &quot;We do right to condemn all violence but we have a special duty to condemn the violence which is committed in our name&quot;.

==Writings==
Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s books include: &quot;States of Ireland&quot; (1972), where he first indicated his revised view of Irish nationalism, &quot;The Great Melody&quot; (1992), his &#x27;thematic&#x27; biography of Edmund Burke, and his autobiography &quot;Memoir: My Life and Themes&quot; (1999). He also published a collection of essays, &quot;Passion and Cunning&quot; (1988), which includes a substantial piece on the literary work of W. B. Yeats and some challenging views on the subject of terrorism, and &quot;The Siege: The Saga of Israel and Zionism&quot; (1986), a history of Zionism and the State of Israel. His books, particularly those on Irish issues, tend to be personalised, for example &quot;States of Ireland&quot;, where he made the link between the political success of the republican Easter Rising and the consequent demise of his Home Rule family&#x27;s position in society. His private papers have been deposited in the University College Dublin Archives.

In 1963, Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s script for a Telefís Éireann programme on Charles Stewart Parnell won him a Jacob&#x27;s Award.

He was a longtime columnist for the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. His articles were distinguished by hostility to the Northern Ireland peace process, regular predictions of civil war involving the Republic of Ireland, and a pro-Unionist stance.

Cruise O&#x27;Brien held visiting professorships and lectureships throughout the world, particularly in the United States, and in apartheid South Africa, openly breaking the academic boycott. A persistent critic of Charles Haughey, Cruise O&#x27;Brien coined the acronym GUBU (Grotesque, Unbelievable, Bizarre and Unprecedented), based on a statement by Charles Haughey, who was then Taoiseach, commenting on the discovery of a murder suspect, Malcolm MacArthur, in the apartment of the Fianna Fáil Attorney General Patrick Connolly. Until 1994, Cruise O&#x27;Brien was a Pro-Chancellor of the University of Dublin.

According to Roy Foster (historian), Colm Tóibín wrote that Seamus Heaney &quot;was so popular that he could even survive being endorsed by Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, which normally meant &#x27;the kiss of death&#x27; in Ireland. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; fact-checking desk found out Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Dublin phone number and called him to ask if his approval meant the kiss of death in his native country: they then telephoned an astonished Tóibín and reproachfully told him: &#x27;Mr O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;No, it didn&#x27;t&quot;.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American country and folk music singer-songwriter. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C.-area clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records. Carpenter&#x27;s first album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Girl&quot;, did not produce any charting singles. She broke through with 1989&#x27;s &quot;State of the Heart&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Straight in the Dark&quot;.

Carpenter&#x27;s most successful album is 1992&#x27;s &quot;Come On Come On&quot;, which accounted for seven singles and was certified quadruple platinum in the United States for shipments of four million copies. Her follow up album, &quot;Stones in the Road&quot;, appeared two years later and won Carpenter the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, while going double platinum for shipments of two million copies. After a number of commercially unsuccessful albums throughout the first decade of the 21st century, she exited Columbia for Zoë Records. Her first album for this label was 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Calling&quot;. She recorded several albums for Zoë until launching her own Lambent Light label in 2015.

Carpenter has won five Grammy Awards, from 18 nominations, including four consecutive wins in the category of Best Female Country Vocal Performance between 1992 and 1995. She has charted 27 times on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, with her 1994 single &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; representing her only number-one single there. Her musical style takes influence from contemporary country and folk, with many of her songs including feminist themes. While largely composed of songs she wrote herself or with longtime producer John Jennings, her discography includes covers of Gene Vincent, Lucinda Williams, and Dire Straits, among others.

==Early life==
Mary Chapin Carpenter was born February 21, 1958, in Princeton, New Jersey. Her father, Chapin Carpenter Jr., was an executive for &quot;Life&quot; magazine. When she was 12 years old, the family moved to Tokyo, Japan, and lived there for about two years, as her father was looking to begin an Asian edition of &quot;Life&quot;. Her mother, Mary Bowie Robertson, was a folk music singer and guitarist. As a child, Carpenter learned to play her mother&#x27;s ukulele and classical guitar in addition to writing songs. She was also inspired by her seventh-grade science teacher, who was a guitarist as well. After her family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1974, Carpenter played folk venues in the area. She attended Brown University, from which she graduated with a degree in American civilization. She began performing cover songs at the folk venues, but by 1981 she had added original material. She befriended John Jennings, a songwriter, instrumentalist, and record producer. The two began collaborating and put together a demo cassette of several of Carpenter&#x27;s songs which she sold at concerts.

==Musical career==
===19871991: Early years with Columbia Records===
Jennings had originally planned to sign Carpenter to an independent label, but the owner of a Washington, D.C. nightclub submitted some of Carpenter&#x27;s demos to a representative of Columbia Records&#x27; Nashville division. This led to her signing with that label in 1987, only two days before she was slated to sign the contract with the other independent label. Columbia released her debut album &quot;Hometown Girl&quot; in 1987. The label hyphenated her first name as &quot;Mary-Chapin&quot; to indicate that it was a compound given name and lessen the possibility of her being referred to as just Mary. Her albums would continue to punctuate her name in this fashion until 1994. Of the ten songs on &quot;Hometown Girl&quot;, Carpenter wrote or co-wrote eight. The two exceptions were &quot;Come On Home&quot; and a cover of Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Downtown Train&quot;. She had also recorded John Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Train&quot; with the intent of including it on the album, but Columbia removed this song because Rosanne Cash had also recorded it and wanted to issue it as a single. Jennings played guitar, synthesizer, piano, bass guitar, and mandolin on the album, while Mark O&#x27;Connor contributed on fiddle and Tony Rice on acoustic guitar. Musician Jon Carroll played piano and also provided percussion by shaking a Cream of Wheat can. While the album did not produce any charting singles, it received word of mouth attention in folk music circles, which led to her being booked to perform at the Philadelphia Folk Festival in addition to serving as an opening act for Emmylou Harris.

Because of her first album&#x27;s commercial failure, Carpenter sought to make her next one more appealing to country radio. She charted for the first time in early 1989 with &quot;How Do&quot;, which ascended to number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. The song served as the lead single to her second Columbia album, &quot;State of the Heart&quot;. The album charted three more singles between 1989 and 1990. First was &quot;Never Had It So Good&quot;, a song which Carpenter wrote with Jennings. By the end of 1989, this became her first top-ten hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;. After it were &quot;Quittin&#x27; Time&quot; (co-written by Robb Royer and Roger Linn) and &quot;Something of a Dreamer&quot;, which Carpenter wrote by herself. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic thought that Carpenter was &quot;still in transition&quot; between the folk influences of her debut and the more mainstream country sounds of her later albums. She won Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music in 1989. At the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1991, &quot;Quittin&#x27; Time&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance.

Her third Columbia album was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Straight in the Dark&quot;. Its first single release was her own composition &quot;You Win Again&quot;. After it was a cover of Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps&#x27; &quot;Right Now&quot;. Both of these cuts achieved top-20 peaks on Hot Country Songs upon release. &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot;, which featured instrumentation from Cajun band BeauSoleil, peaked at number two in 1991. Released last from the album was the top-20 hit &quot;Going Out Tonight&quot;. Folk singer Shawn Colvin, a frequent collaborative partner for Carpenter, sang duet vocals on the closing track &quot;The Moon and St. Christopher&quot;. Don Dixon played bass guitar and sang backing vocals on the &quot;Right Now&quot; cover, and Matt Rollings contributed on piano. Jennings continued to serve as producer in addition to playing several instruments and contributing backing vocals. Jim Bohen of the Morristown, New Jersey, &quot;Daily Record&quot; thought that the album was more upbeat than its predecessors, citing &quot;You Win Again&quot; and &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; as examples. Mike DeGagne of AllMusic thought that the involvements of BeauSoleil and Colvin helped expand Carpenter&#x27;s sound; he also praised her lyrics on &quot;Halley Came to Jackson&quot; and her vocal delivery on &quot;What You Didn&#x27;t Say&quot;. &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; accounted for Carpenter&#x27;s first Grammy Award win in 1992, in the category of Best Female Country Vocal Performance; the song was also nominated that year for Best Country Song. The same year she won Top Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music. The Country Music Association (CMA) awarded her Female Vocalist of the Year in both 1992 and 1993.

===19921995: &quot;Come On Come On&quot; and &quot;Stones in the Road&quot;===

&quot;Come On Come On&quot;, Carpenter&#x27;s fourth Columbia album, was also her most commercially successful. A decade after its 1992 release, it was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), honoring shipments of four million copies in the United States. It also charted a total of seven singles between 1992 and 1994. First among these was &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot;. Upon its release to country radio, it achieved a peak of number four on Hot Country Songs. The song was also a crossover hit in Canada, reaching top five on the country charts and number sixteen on the Adult Contemporary charts (both then published by &quot;RPM&quot;). The next release from the album was &quot;Not Too Much to Ask&quot;, a duet with Joe Diffie. Following this was a cover of Lucinda Williams&#x27; 1989 single &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;. In addition to becoming a top-five country hit, Carpenter&#x27;s rendition of the song went to number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 11 on the Adult Contemporary charts, her first entry on either. In 1993, Carpenter joined other female country singers including Patty Loveless and Kathy Mattea for a television special on CBS titled &quot;The Women of Country&quot;.

The next single off &quot;Come On Come On&quot; was &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, followed by a cover of Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;The Bug&quot;. After it came the top-ten hits &quot;He Thinks He&#x27;ll Keep Her&quot; and &quot;I Take My Chances&quot;. Carpenter co-wrote &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot;, &quot;Not Too Much to Ask&quot;, &quot;He Thinks He&#x27;ll Keep Her&quot;, and &quot;I Take My Chances&quot; with Don Schlitz, and wrote &quot;The Hard Way&quot; by herself. &quot;Come On Come On&quot; accounted for a number of Grammy Award wins and nominations for Carpenter. &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot; and &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; won in the category of Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1993 and 1994 respectively, while &quot;The Hard Way&quot; was nominated by the same association for Best Country Song. Like its predecessor, &quot;Come On Come On&quot; featured several musical collaborators. Colvin provided backing vocals on &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;, and the title track, with the Indigo Girls also appearing on the former. In addition, Rosanne Cash provided vocals to &quot;Rhythm of the Blues&quot;. Former Sly and the Family Stone member Andy Newmark played drums on three tracks. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought the album had more &quot;edge and directness&quot; than its predecessors, and thought that the lyrics had a theme of &quot;women caught between tradition and contemporary roles who realize that the solution lies with their own inner resolve&quot;.

Later in 1994, Carpenter released &quot;Stones in the Road&quot;. Upon its release, it became her only one to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums charts. Likewise, the lead single &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; became her only number one on Hot Country Songs. Follow-up &quot;Tender When I Want to Be&quot; peaked at number six, but the next two singles were less successful. &quot;House of Cards&quot; peaked at 21, while &quot;Why Walk When You Can Fly?&quot; became her first to miss top 40 entirely. &quot;Stones in the Road&quot; was certified double platinum for American sales of two million copies. Carpenter wrote every song on the album by herself. Among the contributing musicians were drummer Kenny Aronoff and keyboardist Benmont Tench. &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;Tender When I Want to Be&quot; both featured backing vocals from Trisha Yearwood, while Lee Roy Parnell played slide guitar on both the former and closing track &quot;This Is Love&quot;. The title track was inspired by her memories of seeing Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral procession when she was young. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that &quot;Carpenter cut back on the number of hooks in her melodies, creating a palette that required closer listening to appreciate&quot;. He compared &quot;Tender When I Want to Be&quot; to the work of Bruce Springsteen, and considered &quot;John Doe No. 24&quot; and &quot;The End of My Pirate Days&quot; &quot;moodier&quot; than her previous works. &quot;Stones in the Road&quot; won Carpenter her first Grammy Award for Best Country Album at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. At the same ceremony, &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; won Best Female Country Vocal Performance and was nominated for Best Country Song, thus meaning that Carpenter won the former award in four consecutive years. She also received her first nomination outside the association&#x27;s country music categories that year, when &quot;He Thinks He&#x27;ll Keep Her&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year.

===19961999: Continuation of Columbia years===
In 1996, Carpenter recorded a song titled &quot;Dreamland&quot; for a multi-artist album of lullabies called &quot;″Til Their Eyes Shine: The Lullaby Album&quot;. The same year HarperCollins published the song&#x27;s lyrics in a children&#x27;s book also titled &quot;Dreamland&quot;, with illustrations by Julia Noonan. All profits from sales of the book were donated to the Institute for Intercultural Understanding, a children&#x27;s advocacy group. Her last studio album to be released in the 1990s was 1997&#x27;s &quot;A Place in the World&quot;. As was the case with &quot;Stones in the Road&quot;, she wrote every song on the album by herself. Carpenter told Russ DeVault of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; (now &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;) before the album&#x27;s release that she wished she had more time to record the album because she &quot;likes to tweak things&quot;. She also stated that the title track represented a &quot;sense of identity&quot; and &quot;search for fulfillment&quot;. Lead single &quot;Let Me into Your Heart&quot; made number eleven on the country music charts. Three singles followed&quot;I Want to Be Your Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;The Better to Dream of You&quot;, and &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; but these three were considerably less successful. &quot;Let Me into Your Heart&quot; accounted for a Grammy nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, her last in that category. Jurek wrote that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t offer the deep reflective rewards of &quot;Stones in the Road&quot;, nor is it quite as kinetic as &quot;Come On Come On&quot;&quot;. Despite this, he thought that it was &quot;well-crafted&quot; and considered &quot;Let Me into Your Heart&quot; to have influences of soul music. After this album, Carpenter stated that she began to feel &quot;malaise&quot; toward the pace of her career. As a result, she deliberately scheduled fewer touring dates to allow herself more time spent with family and friends. She also expressed disdain toward &quot;A Place in the World&quot;, as she felt her management had pressured her into making a &quot;commercially viable&quot; album instead of letting her choose songs she wanted to record. As a result, she hired a new manager, Ron Fierstein, who at the time was also serving in this capacity for Colvin. Fierstein was supportive of Carpenter&#x27;s decision to slow the pace of her career, and encouraged her to focus on touring and selecting songs until she felt she was ready to make another album.

In 1999 she released her first greatest hits album &quot;Party Doll and Other Favorites&quot;. Unlike most greatest hits packages, this consisted mostly of live recordings curated from various concerts and television appearances throughout the 1990s. It also included new studio recordings, which Carpenter and Jennings produced with Blake Chancey. The title track was a cover of Mick Jagger&#x27;s &quot;Party Doll&quot;, from his 1987 album &quot;Primitive Cool&quot;. Two of the new recordings, &quot;Almost Home&quot; and &quot;Wherever You Are&quot;, were issued as singles, with the former becoming her last top-40 country hit. Eli Messinger of Country Standard Time thought that the more up-tempo tracks such as &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; showed &quot;just how much fun Carpenter can be&quot;, while overall praising the album for including the majority of her hit singles.

===20002004: Departure from Columbia===

Her next Columbia album was 2000&#x27;s &quot;Time* Sex* Love*&quot;. Lead single &quot;Simple Life&quot; accounted for her last chart entry to date, peaking at number 53 on Hot Country Songs. According to Carpenter, the asterisks in the title represented an abbreviation of its full name: &quot;Time is the great gift; sex is the great equalizer; love is the great mystery&quot;. This was a response that Jennings had to Carpenter when she stated that those three concepts were all represented in the album&#x27;s lyrical content. Carpenter recorded the album at AIR Studios, a studio in London owned by George Martin. Chancey once again assisted her and Jennings on production duties. She wrote every song on the album, collaborating with Kim Richey, Gary Burr, and Jennings on some tracks. She also said that unlike with &quot;A Place in the World&quot;, she wanted to focus on making an album that she enjoyed, instead of attempting to find songs which would be successful at radio. Throughout 2000 and 2001, she toured in both the United Kingdom and the United States, with Steve Earle joining her for the latter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said of the album that it &quot;found Carpenter departing somewhat from her country-inflected sound and ruminating on relationships and career from a distinctly middle-aged perspective&quot;. John Kenyon of the Cedar Rapids, Iowa &quot;Gazette&quot; thought the album was well-produced but considered it too long and lacking in musical variety. During this album&#x27;s corresponding tour, Carpenter underwent arthroscopic surgery for a knee injury and thus had to perform most of the concerts while seated. She also told Dave Scheiber of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; that while the album&#x27;s songs were positively received in concert, she was disappointed by the lack of radio play and questioned whether she still considered herself a country artist.

In 2002, Carpenter joined Emmylou Harris, Bruce Cockburn, and Patty Griffin in a benefit concert for Campaigning for a Landmine Free World, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of landmines left behind in former war zones. This concert was held at the Thomas Wolfe Auditorium in Asheville, North Carolina. She was also named by Habitat for Humanity as the head of their Build Project, which employed women to build houses for the homeless across the United States. Her contract with Columbia ended with her eighth studio album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Between Here and Gone&quot;. Before its release, she stated in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) that the title track was inspired by the death of songwriter Dave Carter. Other songs on the album were inspired by the emotions Carpenter felt after the September 11 attacks. For this album, Carpenter chose session pianist Matt Rollings to produce, as she wanted to achieve a different production style than John Jennings offered. Despite this, Jennings still played several instruments on the album. Other musicians included Mac McAnally, Stuart Duncan, and Viktor Krauss. The album&#x27;s cover art was painted by Atlanta, Georgia-based painter Donna Mintz, who gave the original art to her as a gift and stated that she often listened to Carpenter&#x27;s albums for inspiration. Jurek thought the album was &quot;a sophisticated but very accessible recording, pleasant in its tempos and in its lush presentation.&quot;

===20072014: Zoë Records===
After leaving Columbia Records, Carpenter signed with the independent Zoë Records (a division of Rounder Records) in 2006. Her first release for the label was 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Calling&quot;. While it accounted for no charting singles, the release reached number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums charts. It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 2007. Once again she wrote the entire album by herself and co-produced with Rollings. Jurek thought the album had stronger rock music influences than its predecessors due to a heavier use of electric guitar and drums, while saying of the album&#x27;s lyrics that she &quot;has a hell of a way of looking at life from all sides&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release Carpenter was hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism, which forced her to cancel all concert dates that year. After being released from the hospital on April 27, 2007, she issued a statement on her website saying she was recovering and planned to tour again in 2008. Once she had recovered she began work on &quot;Come Darkness, Come Light: Twelve Songs of Christmas&quot;, her first album of Christmas music. This was released in 2008. For this project, Carpenter covered tracks by Robin and Linda Williams and the Red Clay Ramblers. She also included renditions of the carol &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot; and the African-American spiritual &quot;Children, Go Where I Send Thee&quot;, in addition to a number of songs she wrote herself. Jennings returned as producer for this project. She stated that the two intentionally sought to make the recording &quot;spare&quot;, and thus did most of the songs with Jennings playing various acoustic instruments and Jon Carroll on piano.

She continued to record for Zoë Records throughout the 2010s, with her next project being &quot;The Age of Miracles&quot; in 2010. Many of the songs on this album were inspired by the emotions she felt after suffering her embolism, particularly the impact it had on her touring and recording career at the time. In particular, she stated that the track &quot;Iceland&quot; represented the &quot;feelings of loss and darkness and disconnection&quot; she felt while hospitalized, and closing track &quot;The Way I Feel&quot; was about the &quot;resilience&quot; she felt after successfully recovering. Rollings co-produced and contributed on piano and Hammond organ, while Dan Dugmore played steel guitar and twelve-string guitar. The album also featured duets with Alison Krauss and Vince Gill. Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote that the album was &quot;a literate and thoughtful set of songs that speak to the concerns of the heart and soul with equal portions of compassion and intelligence&quot;, although he thought it might not appeal to fans of Carpenter&#x27;s more up-tempo work such as &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot;. Jonathan Keefe of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was less favorable toward the album, praising the lyrics of the title track and &quot;I Put My Ring Back On&quot; but overall criticizing the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;a pedestrian, coffeehouse blend of hushed acoustic strumming.&quot; In July 2010, Carpenter performed &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot; at the Grand Ole Opry before doing a concert at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center to promote &quot;The Age of Miracles&quot;. Throughout mid-2011, she toured across the United States in support of this album.

&quot;Ashes and Roses&quot; followed on Zoë in 2012. Two personal life events influenced this album&#x27;s songs: the death of her father, and her divorce from her husband. James Taylor provided duet vocals on the track &quot;Soul Companion&quot;. Jurek called this project &quot;the most confessional record of her career&quot; and praised the use of Hammond organ and mandolin in the production. Allison Stewart of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that it had &quot;woeful and beautiful coffeehouse folk songs, decorated with sparing, almost offhanded instrumentation that’s often limited to guitars and pianos.&quot; Keefe was less favorable toward the project, criticizing Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;hushed&quot; vocal tone and the lack of hooks. Her next project was 2013&#x27;s &quot;Songs from the Movie&quot;, a collaboration with composer and conductor Vince Mendoza. This consisted of orchestral re-recordings of existing songs in her catalog. After this album&#x27;s 2014 release, she performed selections from it with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow, Scotland. Writing for Country Standard Time, Jeffrey B. Remz thought the album needed &quot;a bit more energy&quot; and &quot;veers decidedly towards the precious and pretty side, but sometimes a bit too much so.&quot; In 2014, Carpenter&#x27;s touring schedule included a mix of orchestral performances comprising selections from &quot;Songs from the Movie&quot;, as well as acoustic sets featuring Jon Carroll, multi-instrumentalist John Doyle, and opening act Tift Merritt.

===2015present: Albums on Lambent Light===
After leaving the Zoë label, she began recording her next album in 2015 with production work from Dave Cobb. This album, &quot;The Things That We Are Made Of&quot;, was released in 2016 via Carpenter&#x27;s own Lambent Light Records label, with distribution rights by Thirty Tigers. In addition to producing the album, Cobb played guitar, Moog synthesizer, and Mellotron. &quot;Something Tamed Something Wild&quot; was selected as the lead single. Carpenter promoted the album with a number of dates throughout 2016, starting with a concert at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., that July. Carpenter said that she intentionally intended for her vocal tracks to be &quot;imperfect&quot;, and that she had difficulty &quot;relinquishing control&quot; of production duties. She also said that some of the songs were inspired by her walking her dog through the Blue Ridge Mountains. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, NPR streamed it online through its First Listen program. Scott Stroud of The Associated Press described Cobb&#x27;s production as &quot;elegant&quot; and considered it well suited to Carpenter&#x27;s voice; he also thought that Carpenter&#x27;s lyrics showed an &quot;unexpectedly poignant turn of phrase&quot;. Also in 2015, longtime collaborator John Jennings died of kidney cancer.

Next on Lambent Light was 2018&#x27;s &quot;Sometimes Just the Sky&quot;. This album consisted of re-recordings of tracks from each of her previous albums, as well as the title track, the only original composition. English record producer Ethan Johns produced the project, in addition to selecting all of the musicians except for Carpenter&#x27;s touring guitarist Duke Levine. The musicians recorded the project at Real World Studios, owned by Peter Gabriel. After its release, she embarked on a tour throughout mid-2018 in support. Following this project, she and Johns began work on another album. However, production was put on hiatus in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, Carpenter began streaming live acoustic performances online. The second project with Johns, &quot;The Dirt and the Stars&quot;, was released in August 2020. Also in 2020, she returned to the Wolf Trap where, without an audience present, she performed a 26-song solo acoustic set. This set was recorded as an album and DVD release titled &quot;One Night Lonely&quot;, which received a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album nomination. Once COVID-19 restrictions subsided across the United States, she announced plans to tour with Colvin in 2021. Due to a shoulder injury, she canceled these tour dates and did not begin touring again until 2022. Her tours in this timespan included a number of songs from &quot;The Dirt and the Stars&quot;.

Carpenter&#x27;s next album was released in January 2025. Titled &quot;Looking for the Thread&quot;, it is a collaboration with Scottish folk singers Julie Fowlis and Karine Polwart. She had met the two at the Celtic Connections music festival in Glasgow, and Fowlis and Polwart agreed to collaborate because they were fans of Carpenter&#x27;s music.

==Collaborations and other works==

Carpenter has appeared on a number of works by other artists. One of her first guest appearances was on the Indigo Girls&#x27; 1990 album &quot;Nomads Indians Saints&quot;, where she provided vocals to the track &quot;Hammer and a Nail&quot;. She did likewise to Colvin&#x27;s &quot;Climb on a Back That&#x27;s Strong&quot; and Radney Foster&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Wins&quot;, both from 1992. A year later, she joined Billy Ray Cyrus, Kathy Mattea, Tanya Tucker, and Pam Tillis on Dolly Parton&#x27;s single &quot;Romeo&quot;. This song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals in 1994. Another collaboration with Colvin, &quot;One Cool Remove&quot;, was released as a single from Colvin&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Cover Girl&quot;. This rendition was a charted single for both artists in the United Kingdom a year later. Also in 1994, Carpenter and Kim Richey sang backing vocals on Tillis&#x27; cover of Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, a single from the album &quot;Sweetheart&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

In 1996, she sang a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot; on the multi-artist tribute album &quot;Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon&quot;. This rendition was a minor hit on the Adult Contemporary charts upon release. She sang the song &quot;Dead Man Walking (A Dream Like This)&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1996 movie &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. A year later, she covered Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Carpenter also appeared on bluegrass musician Randy Scruggs&#x27; only charted single &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;, from his 1998 album &quot;Crown of Jewels&quot;. In 2002, she joined Sheryl Crow and Emmylou Harris to cover Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash&quot;. This track received a nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards.

Carpenter is credited as a writer on a number of songs for other artists. These include Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Sally&#x27;s Pigeons&quot;, Wynonna Judd&#x27;s &quot;Girls with Guitars&quot;, Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;, and Terri Clark&#x27;s &quot;No Fear&quot;.

==Musical style==
Carpenter&#x27;s music is defined by her folk music influences and lyrical focus. Erlewine wrote that Carpenter &quot;found favor on country radio in the 1980s and &#x27;90s by taking her emotionally intelligent songs to a mass audience.&quot; Of her 1980s albums, he stated that &quot;Country radio was hesitant to play her soft, folky, feminist material, but she received good reviews and airplay on more progressive country stations, as well as college radio&quot;. In the &quot;Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, Colin Larkin noted the use of electric guitar in her more upbeat material such as &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; and &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, while also referring to &quot;House of Cards&quot; as &quot;thought-provoking&quot;. He also stated, &quot;she, together with the likes of Trisha Yearwood, Suzy Bogguss, and Kathy Mattea, has brought fresh melody to an old and sometimes predictable genre.&quot; Larry Katz of the &quot;Red Deer Advocate&quot; contrasted her with Yearwood and Wynonna Judd, noting that unlike those artists, Carpenter usually wrote her songs herself instead of relying on Nashville-based songwriters. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that by being a graduate of an Ivy League college, Carpenter &quot;seemed the least likely female to go the distance on the country charts&quot;. Similarly, Katz thought that her upbringing was atypical of country music, which is more commonly associated with demographics pertaining to the rural Southern United States.

Nash also noted the difference between &quot;decidedly noncountry themes like Halley’s Comet and the spiritual life of old shirts&quot; in contrast to her more up-tempo material such as &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot;. In a review of &quot;Stones in the Road&quot; for the same publication, Browne contrasted that album with &quot;Come On Come On&quot;, saying of the latter that &quot;her square-jawed voice, leaner lyrics, and the sturdy-as-a-wooden-fence folk rock combined to make a deserved[...]breakthrough.&quot; He also said of her writing style that Carpenter &quot;sounds like someone who sits down and thinks about it — a lot — before committing it to song. Not since the heyday of Gordon Lightfoot has a singer-songwriter been so damn reasonable.&quot; Mike DeGagne of AllMusic said of Carpenter&#x27;s lyrics that she &quot;portray[s] maturely the perils of romance and heartbreak from a female perspective&quot;. Writing for &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Deborah Evans Price noted themes of feminism due to many of her songs being about single women attempting to overcome setbacks in her life; of this, Carpenter stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve just been kind of writing for me.&quot; Similarly, Nash stated that many of the songs on &quot;Shooting Straight in the Dark&quot; featured women protagonists who &quot;take matters into their own hands&quot;. Eli Messinger of Country Standard Time described her singing voice as having &quot;empathic clarity and force&quot;, particularly on &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; and &quot;He Thinks He&#x27;ll Keep Her&quot;. He also stated that the former song had a theme of &quot;desire&quot;, and the latter a &quot;call to self-fulfillment&quot;. Keefe found influences of folk and country pop in her 1990s albums, but thought that much of her work in the 21st century was &quot;mixed&quot; due to a lack of uptempo material and lyrical themes which he considered too similar to each other. He described the stronger tracks on these albums as appealing to adult album alternative formats.

==Personal life==
Carpenter was unmarried for most of her recording career. In a 1994 profile, Dana Kennedy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to Carpenter as &quot;a spokes-singer for the thirtysomething single woman&quot;. On June 1, 2002, she married Timmy Smith, a general contractor then working in Batesville, Virginia. Actress Sissy Spacek and singer Dave Matthews were in attendance at the wedding. By 2007, the couple lived on a farm outside Charlottesville, Virginia. The couple divorced shortly before the release of &quot;Ashes and Roses&quot; (2012), at which point Carpenter continued to live on the farm. That album&#x27;s track &quot;What to Keep and What to Throw Away&quot; was inspired by her divorce from Smith.

Carpenter was the author of four columns in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; from December 2008 to March 2009, in which she discussed topics related to music and politics. Ben Walsh of &quot;The Independent&quot; cited this, along with her involvements in various charities, as examples of Carpenter&#x27;s liberal political leanings. Relatedly, she told &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; in 1995 that she considered herself to be politically liberal; she also stated that &quot;it seems as if the Republicans co-opted the entire country music community. In fact, a lot of country artists are Democrats.&quot;

==Awards==
Carpenter has won five Grammy Awards, three Academy of Country Music awards, and two Country Music Association awards.

==Discography==
Carpenter has released seventeen studio albums between 1987 and 2025.

<text>Matthew Kelly (born David Allan Kelly, 9 May 1950) is an English actor and television presenter. Having been trained as a theatre actor, he first came to public prominence as a television sitcom actor, game-show panellist and television presenter of ITV light entertainment shows such as &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;, &quot;You Bet!&quot; and &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;. In the 2000s he returned to acting, appearing in several West End productions and playing television roles.

==Early life and education==
Kelly was involved with Urmston Musical Theatre in Urmston, Lancashire, most notably playing the role of Louis in a production of &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1963. Kelly appeared regularly at Liverpool&#x27;s Everyman Theatre. 

He is a former member of the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party.

In his early forties, he studied at the Open University where he gained a degree in psychology.

==Career==
Kelly&#x27;s first major TV appearances came in the ITV sitcom &quot;Holding the Fort&quot; (1980-82), and as a panellist in the game show &quot;Punchlines&quot; (1981-84), hosted by Lennie Bennett on ITV, but he became more famous as part of the original presenting team on &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;, for the same producers and network. He was the original presenter of Children&#x27;s ITV (CITV) when launched in January 1983, and returned to the role sporadically over the next few years. He was the subject of an edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1983 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square.

For the next 14 years his work centred on light entertainment shows such as &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Eye&quot; (TVS sketch show 1985), &quot;You Bet!&quot; (LWT/ITV) (1991–95) and, most notably, &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; (Granada/ITV), which he took over from Russ Abbot, who was brought in as a temporary host after original presenter Leslie Crowther suffered serious head injuries in a car crash in October 1992. Abbot had only hosted one episode, an Elvis Presley special. However, it later became apparent that Crowther would not be able to return, as he retired in 1994, and then died two years later. Therefore, Kelly became the permanent host of the show until he left in March 2004. Simultaneously, he was narrator for the ITV series &quot;After They Were Famous&quot; from 1999 to 2005. He continued to act occasionally, notably in the Channel 4 comedy &quot;Relative Strangers&quot;, and in the theatre production of &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;.

Following his departure from &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; Kelly returned to acting full-time. He has appeared in a number of television and theatre productions. In 2005, he was a member of the cast in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Bleak House&quot; as Mr Turveydrop. He also played a serial killer in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Cold Blood&quot; and its 2007 sequel, as well as the explorer Giovanni Belzoni in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Egypt&quot;. On the stage he won an Olivier Award in 2004 for his portrayal of Lennie in John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; at the Savoy Theatre. Other work includes Ripafratta in &quot;Mirandolina&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre in August 2006, which he swiftly followed by appearing as a well-received Antonio Salieri in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot;. For a short period in summer 2007 he played the character Willie Thorn (not the snooker player) in the farce &quot;Out For Justice&quot; in Sydney, Australia&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre.

From December 2008 to January 2009, he joined Stefanie Powers, Craig McLachlan and Christopher Biggins at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton to play May, one of the ugly sisters, in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; alongside his son Matthew Rixon. In 2009, he was on stage to high critical acclaim, in Howard Barker&#x27;s &quot;Victory: Choices in Reaction&quot;, at the Arcola Theatre, then as George in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Garrick Theatre, Lichfield, followed by a season at London&#x27;s Trafalgar Studios. The summer was spent as Pandarus in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; at the Globe in London. He opened in &quot;Comedians&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in October 2009.

In January 2010, Kelly replaced Simon Callow as Pozzo in the revival of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, alongside Ian McKellen (Estragon), Roger Rees (Vladimir) and Ronald Pickup (Lucky). He continued in the successful production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, in May 2010.

In November 2010, Kelly was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Chester. In March 2012, he returned to mainstream television by appearing in the ITV comedy &quot;Benidorm&quot;, playing Cyril Babcock, a judge for the hotel&#x27;s dance competition; he reprised the role in 2014. During the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he played the role of Frank in a production of the play &quot;Educating Rita&quot;. In 2014, Kelly acted in a short drama called &quot;Cherry Cake&quot;, and in 2016, he played a one-off role of a carer/grandad in the TV series &quot;Casualty&quot;. In 2018, he hosted the documentary series &quot;Top of the Box&quot;. In September 2019, Kelly appeared as the Toy Shop owner in the stage production of &quot;Big&quot;. In May 2024, he starred in the critically acclaimed BBC dark comedy series Inside No. 9 as Harold.

==Personal life==
Kelly married Sarah Gray in 1975. They have mostly lived separately, he in London and she in Cheshire and then West Sussex.

In January 2003, Kelly was arrested by police over allegations of child sex abuse, which arose as part of Operation Arundel. The following month he was cleared of all charges. In response to his public arrest, and the later media fallout that drew public criticism, his treatment was raised as a motion in Parliament to consider &quot;ways to protect the anonymity of those investigated until formally charged with an offence.&quot; This was later debated within Parliament as part of a wider response to investigations into allegations of historical crimes. In the same year, Kelly appeared on &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot; to discuss the host&#x27;s jokes, which took aim at his alleged abuse of children.

<text>Terence Vincent Powderly (January 22, 1849 – June 24, 1924) was an American labor union leader, politician and attorney, best known as head of the Knights of Labor in the late 1880s. Born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, he was later elected mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for three 2-year terms, starting in 1878. A Republican, he served as the United States Commissioner General of Immigration in 1897. The Knights of Labor was one of the largest American labor organizations of the 19th century, but Powderly was a poor administrator and could barely keep it under control. His small central office could not supervise or coordinate the many strikes and other activities sponsored by union locals. Powderly believed that the Knights were an educational tool to uplift the workingman, and he often cautioned against the use of strikes to achieve workers&#x27; goals. 

His influence reportedly led to the passing of the alien contract labor law in 1885 and establishment of labor bureaus and arbitration boards in many states. The Knights failed to maintain its large membership after being blamed for the violence of the Haymarket Riot of 1886. It was increasingly upstaged by the American Federation of Labor under Samuel Gompers, which coordinated numerous specialized craft unions that appealed to skilled workers, instead of the mix of unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled workers in the Knights.

==Early life==
Powderly was born the 11th of 12 children on January 22, 1849, to Irish parents who had come up from poverty, Terence Powderly and Madge Walsh, who had emigrated to the United States in 1827. As a child he contracted the measles, as well as scarlet fever which left him deaf in one ear.

At the age of 13 he began work for the railroad as a switchman with the Delaware and Hudson Railway, before becoming a car examiner, repairer and eventually a brakeman. On August 1, 1866, at the age of 17, he entered into an apprenticeship as a machinist with the local master mechanic, James Dickson, at which he was employed until August 15, 1869. Dickson himself had apprenticed to George Stephenson.

On November 21, 1871, Powderly joined the Subordinate Union No. 2 of Pennsylvania, part of the Machinists and Blacksmiths International Union, and a year later was elected as its secretary, before eventually becoming president. On September 19, 1872, Powderly married Hannah Dever.

Following the Panic of 1873, Powderly was dismissed from this position at the railroad. In recalling the conversation, Powderly wrote that the master mechanic he worked for had explained to him, &quot;You are the president of the union and it is thought best to dismiss you in order to head off trouble.&quot; He then spent the following winter in Canada working odd jobs. He returned to the US in 1874, working briefly in Galion, Ohio before moving on to Oil City, Pennsylvania for six months, where he joined Pennsylvania Union No. 6. In August of that year, he was elected by No. 6 as a delegate to a district meeting representing Pittsburgh, Oil City, Meadville, and Franklin, and was in turn elected to represent the district at the general convention in Louisville, Kentucky in September. Powderly was also a member of the Irish nationalist organization Clann na Gael.

==Scranton==
Powderly ended his travels in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he found work as a machinist installing coal breakers. Two weeks after taking the position, he was dismissed after being identified by the same man who had been instrumental in his previous dismissal in 1872. In response, he appealed to William Walker Scranton, who had given him the position to start. After explaining to Scranton that he had been fired originally due to his connection to the union, Powderly recalled:

He asked me if I was president then, I answered in the negative, but in order to be fully understood told him that I was at the time secretary. His next question was &quot;If I reinstate you will you resign from the union?&quot; My answer to that was: &quot;I am insured for one thousand dollars in the union. I cannot afford any other insurance. If I resign and am killed in the employ of this company, will it pay my wife one thousand dollars?&quot; He looked steadily at me a while and said: &quot;Go to the mill and tell Davidson to set you to work.&quot;

Through W. W. Scranton, Powderly went on to work for the Dickson Manufacturing Company, a firm founded by the sons of his apprentice master. He was again dismissed through the involvement of the same individual, and was again reinstated by Scranton, now in charge of the department, where he worked until May 31, 1877, when it closed for lack of work.

In 1878 following strikes and unrest in 1877, Powderly was elected to the first of three two-year terms as mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, representing the Greenback-Labor Party. During the election he proposed financing public works project through low interest government loans as a means of providing work for the many unemployed. After assuming office, he immediately reorganized the labor force and enacted moderate reforms.

==Knights of Labor==
Powderly is most remembered for leading the Knights of Labor (&quot;K of L&quot;), a nationwide labor union. He joined the Knights in 1874, became Secretary of a District Assembly in 1877. He was elected Grand Master Workman in 1879 after the resignation of Uriah Smith Stephens. At the time the Knights had around 10,000 members. He served as Grand Master Workman until 1893.

Powderly, along with most white labor leaders at the time, opposed the immigration of Chinese workers to the United States. He argued that non- European immigrants took jobs away from native-born Americans and drove down wages. He urged West Coast branches of the Knights of Labor to campaign for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. In speaking on nationwide violence against the &quot;Chinese evil&quot;, Powderly blamed the &quot;indifference of our law-makers to the just demands of the people for relief.&quot;

Powderly worked with Bishop James Gibbons of to persuade the Pope to remove sanctions against Catholics who joined unions. The Catholic Church had opposed the unions as too influenced by rituals of freemasonry. The Knights of Labor removed the words &quot;The Holy and Noble Order of&quot; from the name of the Knights of Labor in 1882 and abandoned any membership rituals associated with freemasonry.

Powderly was more influenced by the Greenback ideology of producerism than by socialism, a rising school of thought in Europe and the United States. Since producerism regarded most employers as &quot;producers&quot;, Powderly disliked strikes. At times, the Knights organized strikes against local firms where the employer might be admitted as a member. The strikes would drive away the employers, resulting in a more purely working-class organization.

Despite his personal ambivalence about labor action, Powderly was skillful in organizing. The success of the Great Southwest railroad strike of 1886 against Jay Gould&#x27;s railroad more than compensated for the internal tension of his organization. The Knights of Labor grew so rapidly that at one point the organization called a moratorium on the issuance of charters.

The union was recognized as the first successful national labor union in the United States. In 1885-86 the Knights achieved their greatest influence and greatest membership. Powderly attempted to focus the union on cooperative endeavors and the eight-hour day. Soon the demands placed on the union by its members for immediate improvements, and the pressures of hostile business and government institutions, forced the Knights to function like a traditional labor union. However, the Knights were too disorganized to deal with the centralized industries that they were striking against. Powderly forbade them to use their most effective tool: the strike. Powderly intervened in two labor actions: the first against the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1886 and the second against the Chicago Meatpackinghouse industry. 25,000 workers in the Union Stockyards struck for an 8-hour day in 1886 and to rescind a wage reduction. In both cases, Powderly ended strikes that historians believe that labor could have won. This is when the Knights of Labor began to lose its influence. Powderly also feared losing the support of the Catholic Church, which many immigrant workers belonged to; the church authorities were essentially conservative and feared that the K of L was plotting a &quot;socialist revolution&quot;.
Powderly&#x27;s insistence on ending both these strikes meant that the companies did not fear the K of L would use strikes as direct action to gain wage and labor benefits. After this, both Jay Gould and the Chicago Packinghouses won complete victories in breaking both strikes.

Powderly, during the Knight&#x27;s 1886 general assembly in Richmond, Virginia purposely invited a Black member to introduce him before his speech. This was intended by Powderly as an attack on Richmond&#x27;s segregation codes. 

Disaster struck the Knights with the Haymarket Square Riot in Chicago on May 4, 1886. Anarchists were blamed, and two of them were Knights. Membership plunged overnight as a result of false rumors linking the Knights to anarchism and terrorism. However the disorganization of the group and its record of losing strike after strike disillusioned many members. Bitter factionalism divided the union, and its forays into electoral politics were failures because Powderly forbade its members to engage in political activity or to field candidates.

Many KoL members joined more conservative alternatives, especially the Railroad brotherhoods, and the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which promoted craft unionism over the one all-inclusive union concept. Powderly was defeated for re-election as Master Workman in 1893. As the decline of the Knights continued, Powderly moved on, opening a successful law practice in 1894.

Powderly was also a supporter of Henry George&#x27;s popular &quot;single tax&quot; on land values.

==Later career==

President William McKinley appointed Powderly as the Commissioner General of Immigration where he served from July 1, 1897, to June 24, 1902. In this role he established a commission to investigate conditions at Ellis Island, which ultimately led to 11 employees being dismissed. After being removed from the post in 1902 by Theodore Roosevelt, he continued to serve as Special Immigration Inspector, studying the causes of European emigration to the United States, where he recommended that officials inspect potential immigrants prior to their arrival in the US, station officers on immigrant-carrying ships, and take steps to more evenly distribute arriving immigrant populations geographically across the country.

Terence Powderly was appointed as the chief of the newly created Immigration Service&#x27;s Division of Information, with a mission, following his own prior recommendation, to &quot;promote a beneficial distribution of aliens admitted into the United States.&quot; Finally, in 1921, three years prior to his death, he was appointed as a member of the Immigration Service&#x27;s Board of Review.

==Death==
Powderly, a resident of the Petworth neighborhood in Washington, D.C., in the last years of his life, died at his home there on June 24, 1924. He is buried at nearby Rock Creek Cemetery. A second autobiography by Powderly, &quot;The Path I Trod&quot;, was published posthumously in 1940. Powderly&#x27;s papers are available for use at more than a dozen research libraries across the United States. He was survived by his second wife, Emma (Fickensher), who was his late wife&#x27;s cousin and a former work associate, who he had married in 1919.

==Legacy==
Powderly was inducted into the U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Honor in 1999. The citation reads as follows:

As leader of the Knights of Labor, the nation&#x27;s first successful trade union organization, Terence V. Powderly thrust the workers&#x27; needs to the fore for the first time in U.S. history. In the 1800s, far in advance for the period, he sought the inclusion of blacks, women and Hispanics for full-fledged membership in his trade union. With labor struggling for a place at America&#x27;s economic table, Powderly achieved national stature as the recognized spokesman for the workers&#x27; interest and for the first time made organized labor a political force to be reckoned with.

Writing in Dubofsky and Van Tine&#x27;s &quot;Labor Leaders in America&quot;, Richard Oestreicher described Powderly as &quot;the first labor leader in American history to become a media superstar&quot;. Oestreicher continues:

No other worker in these years, not even his rival Samuel Gompers, captured as much attention from reporters, from politicians, or from industrialists. To his contemporaries Powderly &quot;was&quot; the Knights of Labor.
Oestreicher characterizes Powderly&#x27;s legacy as leader of the Knights as generally one of failure to preserve the organization and its mission through the labor upheavals of the late 19th Century. However, he continues to describe him as an &quot;energetic and capable organizer,&quot; and is quick to point out the practical challenges both he and the Knights faced, and that in comparison to his heirs and contemporaries, &quot;quite simply, no one else did much better [than they did] over the next forty years.&quot;

In 1966 Powderly&#x27;s long time home at 614 North Main Street in Scranton was designated by the National Park Service as a National Historic Landmark. On November 18, 1947, a historical maker was placed in Scranton honoring Powderly.

<text>In physics, and in particular as measured by radiometry, radiant energy is the energy of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. As energy, its SI unit is the joule (J). The quantity of radiant energy may be calculated by integrating radiant flux (or power) with respect to time. The symbol &quot;Q&quot;e is often used throughout literature to denote radiant energy (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities). In branches of physics other than radiometry, electromagnetic energy is referred to using &quot;E&quot; or &quot;W&quot;. The term is used particularly when electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a source into the surrounding environment. This radiation may be visible or invisible to the human eye.

==Terminology use and history==
The term &quot;radiant energy&quot; is most commonly used in the fields of radiometry, solar energy, heating and lighting, but is also sometimes used in other fields (such as telecommunications). In modern applications involving transmission of power from one location to another, &quot;radiant energy&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the electromagnetic waves &quot;themselves&quot;, rather than their &quot;energy&quot; (a property of the waves). In the past, the term &quot;electro-radiant energy&quot; has also been used.

The term &quot;radiant energy&quot; also applies to gravitational radiation. For example, the first gravitational waves ever observed were produced by a black hole collision that emitted about 5.3 joules of gravitational-wave energy.

==Analysis==

Because electromagnetic (EM) radiation can be conceptualized as a stream of photons, radiant energy can be viewed as photon energy – the energy carried by these photons. Alternatively, EM radiation can be viewed as an electromagnetic wave, which carries energy in its oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These two views are completely equivalent and are reconciled to one another in quantum field theory (see wave-particle duality).

EM radiation can have various frequencies. The bands of frequency present in a given EM signal may be sharply defined, as is seen in atomic spectra, or may be broad, as in blackbody radiation. In the particle picture, the energy carried by each photon is proportional to its frequency. In the wave picture, the energy of a monochromatic wave is proportional to its intensity. This implies that if two EM waves have the same intensity, but different frequencies, the one with the higher frequency &quot;contains&quot; fewer photons, since each photon is more energetic.

When EM waves are absorbed by an object, the energy of the waves is converted to heat (or converted to electricity in case of a photoelectric material). This is a very familiar effect, since sunlight warms surfaces that it irradiates. Often this phenomenon is associated particularly with infrared radiation, but any kind of electromagnetic radiation will warm an object that absorbs it. EM waves can also be reflected or scattered, in which case their energy is redirected or redistributed as well.

===Open systems===
Radiant energy is one of the mechanisms by which energy can enter or leave an open system. Such a system can be man-made, such as a solar energy collector, or natural, such as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In geophysics, most atmospheric gases, including the greenhouse gases, allow the Sun&#x27;s short-wavelength radiant energy to pass through to the Earth&#x27;s surface, heating the ground and oceans. The absorbed solar energy is partly re-emitted as longer wavelength radiation (chiefly infrared radiation), some of which is absorbed by the atmospheric greenhouse gases. Radiant energy is produced in the sun as a result of nuclear fusion.

==Applications==
Radiant energy is used for radiant heating. It can be generated electrically by infrared lamps, or can be absorbed from sunlight and used to heat water. The heat energy is emitted from a warm element (floor, wall, overhead panel) and warms people and other objects in rooms rather than directly heating the air. Because of this, the air temperature may be lower than in a conventionally heated building, even though the room appears just as comfortable.

Various other applications of radiant energy have been devised. These include treatment and inspection, separating and sorting, medium of control, and medium of communication. Many of these applications involve a source of radiant energy and a detector that responds to that radiation and provides a signal representing some characteristic of the radiation. Radiant energy detectors produce responses to incident radiant energy either as an increase or decrease in electric potential or current flow or some other perceivable change, such as exposure of photographic film.

<text>Walter Andrew Brennan (July 25, 1894 – September 21, 1974) was an American actor and singer. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1936), &quot;Kentucky&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940), making him one of only seven actors to win more than two Academy Awards, and the only male or female actor to win three awards in the supporting actor category. Brennan was also nominated for his performance in &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941). Other noteworthy performances were in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), &quot;Red River&quot; (1948) and &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959). On television, he starred in the sitcom &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; (1957-1963).

==Early life==
Brennan was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on July 25 1894, less than two miles from his family&#x27;s home in Swampscott. His parents were both Irish immigrants. His father was an engineer and inventor, and young Brennan also studied engineering at Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

While working as a bank clerk, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a private with the 101st Field Artillery Regiment in France for two years during World War I. &quot;While there, he suffered an injury to his vocal cords from exposure to mustard gas that left him with his screen trademark: a distinctively reedy, high-pitched voice that became a favorite for celebrity impersonators for decades.&quot;

After the war, he worked as a financial reporter for a newspaper in Boston. During the early 1920s, he made a fortune in the real estate market, but lost most of his money during a real estate slump.

==Career==
===Early work===
Finding himself penniless, Brennan began taking parts as an extra in films at Universal Studios in 1925, starting at $7.50 a day, equal to $ today. He wound up working at Universal off and on for the next ten years.

His early appearances included &quot;Webs of Steel&quot; (1925), &quot;Lorraine of the Lions&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Calgary Stampede&quot; (1925), a Hoot Gibson Western. Brennan was also in &quot;Watch Your Wife&quot; (1926), &quot;The Ice Flood&quot; (1926), &quot;Spangles&quot; (1926), &quot;The Collegians&quot; (1926, a short), &quot;Flashing Oars&quot; (1926, a short), &quot;Sensation Seekers&quot; (1927), &quot;Tearin&#x27; Into Trouble&quot; (1927), &quot;The Ridin&#x27; Rowdy&quot; (1927), &quot;Alias the Deacon&quot; (1927), &quot;Blake of Scotland Yard&quot; (1927) (a serial), &quot;Hot Heels&quot; (1927), &quot;Painting the Town&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Ballyhoo Buster&quot; (1928). The latter was directed by Richard Thorpe who would use Brennan as an extra several times on films.

Brennan had minor roles in &quot;The Racket&quot; (1928) from Howard Hughes, &quot;The Michigan Kid&quot; (1928), &quot;Silks and Saddles&quot; (1929), &quot;The Cohens and the Kellys in Atlantic City&quot; (1929) and &quot;Smilin&#x27; Guns&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Lariat Kid&quot; (1929) with Gibson. He also worked as a stand in.

Brennan was in &quot;His Lucky Day&quot; (1929), Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Flight&quot; (1929), &quot;One Hysterical Night&quot; (1929) (a bigger role), &quot;The Last Performance&quot; (1929), &quot;The Long Long Trail&quot; (1929) with Gibson and &quot;The Shannons of Broadway&quot; (1929).

Other Brennan appearances included &quot;Dames Ahoy!&quot; (1930), &quot;Captain of the Guard&quot; (1930), &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930) (Brennan said he played nine parts but when he saw the film &quot;I sneezed and I missed myself&quot;), &quot;The Little Accident&quot; (1930), &quot;Parlez Vous&quot; (1930), (a short), &quot;See America Thirst&quot; (1930) with Harry Langdon and Slim Summerville and &quot;Ooh La-La&quot; (1930), (another short).

The following year Brennan had more small roles in &quot;Hello Russia&quot; (1931, a short with Slim Summerville), &quot;Many a Slip&quot; (1931) with Summerville, &quot;Heroes of the Flames&quot; (1931) a serial with Tim McCoy, &quot;Honeymoon Lane&quot; (1931), &quot;Dancing Dynamite&quot; (1931), &quot;Grief Street&quot; (1931) directed by Richard Thorpe and &quot;Is There Justice?&quot; (1931).

Brennan had a bigger role in &quot;Neck and Neck&quot; (1931), directed by Richard Thorpe. His parts tended to remain small, however: &quot;A House Divided&quot; (1931) for director William Wyler, &quot;Scratch-As-Catch-Can&quot; (1931, a Bobby Clark short directed by Mark Sandrich), and &quot;Texas Cyclone&quot; (1931, a Tim McCoy Western featuring a young John Wayne).

In 1932 Brennan was in &quot;Law and Order&quot; (1932) with Walter Huston, &quot;The Impatient Maiden&quot; (1932) for James Whale, &quot;The Airmail Mystery&quot; (1932, a serial) and &quot;Scandal for Sale&quot; (1932). He did another with John Wayne, &quot;Two-Fisted Law&quot; (1932) though the star was Tim McCoy.

Brennan was in &quot;Hello Trouble&quot; (1932) with Buck Jones, &quot;Speed Madness&quot; (1932), &quot;Miss Pinkerton&quot; (1932) with Joan Bennett, &quot;Cornered&quot; (1932) with McCoy, &quot;The Iceman&#x27;s Ball&quot; (1932, another short for Sandrich), &quot;Fighting for Justice&quot; (1932) with McCoy, &quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot; (1932) with Tom Mix, &quot;The All American&quot; (1932), &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1932), &quot;Strange Justice&quot; (1932), &quot;Women Won&#x27;t Tell&quot; (1932) for Richard Thorpe, &quot;Afraid to Talk&quot; (1932) and &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; (1932).

Brennan was in &quot;Sensation Hunters&quot; (1933) for Charles Vidor, &quot;Man of Action&quot; (1933) with McCoy, &quot;Parachute Jumper&quot; (1933), &quot;Goldie Gets Along&quot; (1933), &quot;Girl Missing&quot; (1933), &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Roundup&quot; (1933) with Mix, &quot;The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble&quot; (1933) for director George Stevens, &quot;Lucky Dog&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Big Cage&quot; (1933). His scenes in William Wellman&#x27;s &quot;Lilly Turner&quot; (1933) were deleted.

Brennan did another serial, &quot;The Phantom of the Air&quot; (1933), then &quot;Strange People&quot; (1933) for Thorpe, &quot;Meet the Champ&quot; (1933, a short), &quot;Sing Sinner Sing&quot; (1933), &quot;One Year Later&quot; (1933), &quot;Sailors Beware!&quot; (1933, a short), &quot;Golden Harvest&quot; (1933), &quot;Ladies Must Love&quot; (1933), &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1933), &quot;Curtain at Eight&quot; (1933) and &quot;My Woman&quot; (1933).

James Whale gave him a bit part in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933) and he could be seen in &quot;King for a Night&quot; (1933), &quot;Fugitive Lovers&quot; (1933), &quot;Cross Country Cruise&quot; (1934), &quot;Beloved&quot; (1934), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Buy Everything&quot; (1934), &quot;Paradise Valley&quot; (1934), &quot;Radio Dough&quot; (1934, a short), &quot;The Poor Rich&quot; (1934), &quot;The Crosby Murder Case&quot; (1934), &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; (1934), &quot;Good Girl&quot; (1934), &quot;Riptide&quot; (1934), &quot;Uncertain Lady&quot; (1934), &quot;I&#x27;ll Tell the World&quot; (1934) and &quot;Fishing for Trouble&quot; (1934, a short).

Brennan was in the Three Stooges short &quot;Woman Haters&quot; (1934), then did &quot;Half a Sinner&quot; (1934), &quot;The Life of Vergie Winters&quot; (1934), &quot;Murder on the Runaway Train&quot; (1934), &quot;Whom the Gods Destroy&quot; (1934), &quot;Gentlemen of Polish&quot; (1934, a short), &quot;Death on the Diamond&quot; (1934), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1934), &quot;Luck of the Game&quot; (1934), &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; (1934, a serial), &quot;There&#x27;s Always Tomorrow&quot; (1934) and &quot;Cheating Cheaters&quot; (1934).

Brennan was back with McCoy for &quot;The Prescott Kid&quot; (1934) and could be seen in &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (1934), &quot;Biography of a Bachelor Girl&quot; (1935), &quot;Helldorado&quot; (1935), &quot;Brick-a-Brac&quot; (1935) an Edgar Kennedy short, &quot;Northern Frontier&quot; (1935), &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1935) and &quot;Law Beyond the Range&quot; (1935) with McCoy. He also had a brief uncredited role in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) starring Boris Karloff as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster.

Around this time, Brennan received what he later described as &quot;the luckiest break in the world.&quot; He was acting in a fight scene when an actor kicked him in the face and knocked out all of his teeth. As a result, Brennan wore false teeth. He said, &quot;I looked all right off the set, but when necessary I could take &#x27;em out and suddenly look about 40 years older.&quot;

Brennan appeared in another Three Stooges short, &quot;Restless Knights&quot;, and a short titled &quot;Hunger Pains&quot; in 1935.

===Work at MGM===
A break for Brennan came when he was cast in &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; (1935), produced by Sam Goldwyn, alongside Gary Cooper (it was actually their second film together). He was only an extra, but his part was expanded during filming and it resulted in Brennan&#x27;s getting a contract with Goldwyn.

Goldwyn mostly loaned out Brennan&#x27;s services to other studios. MGM put him in &quot;West Point of the Air&quot; (1935). He was reunited with Whale in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), in which he had a brief speaking part and also worked as a stuntman.

Brennan&#x27;s parts remained small in &quot;Party Wire&quot; (1935), &quot;Spring Tonic&quot; (1935), &quot;The Gay Lady&quot; (1935), &quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot; (1935) and &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1935). He did a short, &quot;The Perfect Tribute&quot; (1935) and was in George Stevens&#x27; &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (1935), but his scenes were deleted.

He could be seen in &quot;We&#x27;re in the Money&quot; (1935) and &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Take It&quot; (1935).

===Move to supporting actor===
Brennan finally earned significant roles with a decent part in Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935), directed by Howard Hawks and an uncredited William Wyler. &quot;That really set me up&quot;, Brennan said later.

He followed with small appearances in &quot;Metropolitan&quot; (1935) and &quot;Seven Keys to Baldpate&quot; (1935).

He had one of the leads in &quot;Three Godfathers&quot; (1936) playing one of the title outlaws.

He had a small role in &quot;These Three&quot; (1936) with Wyler and a larger one in Walter Wanger&#x27;s &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Our Home&quot; (1936) and &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), directed by Fritz Lang.

===First Oscar: &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1936)===
Brennan&#x27;s breakthrough part came when cast by Howard Hawks as Swan Bostrom in the period film &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1936), playing the sidekick of Edward Arnold who eventually marries the girl Arnold abandons (played by Frances Farmer). Producer Sam Goldwyn fired Hawks during filming and replaced him with William Wyler. Brennan&#x27;s performance earned him the first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Brennan followed it with support parts in &quot;Banjo on My Knee&quot; (1936) at Fox, &quot;She&#x27;s Dangerous&quot; (1937), and &quot;When Love is Young&quot; (1937). Goldwyn announced him for a role in &quot;The Real Glory&quot; in 1936, but he ended up not appearing in the final film.

Brennan had his first lead role in &quot;Affairs of Cappy Ricks&quot; (1937) at Republic Pictures. He followed it with the co-starring part in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; (1937), billed second after Jane Withers. He was in &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1938), directed by Cecil B. DeMille.

Brennan portrayed town drunk and accused murderer Muff Potter in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938).

Brennan followed it with &quot;The Texans&quot; (1938), &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s Chickens&quot; (1938) and Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; (1938) with Gary Cooper – the first time Brennan played Cooper&#x27;s sidekick.

===Second Oscar: &quot;Kentucky&quot; (1938)===
Brennan won his second Best Supporting Oscar for &quot;Kentucky&quot; (1938), a horse racing film from 20th Century Fox with Loretta Young.

He supported Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot; (1939). Brennan also appeared in &quot;Melody of Youth&quot; (1939), and &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939) at Fox. At MGM he was in &quot;Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President&quot; (1939).

Throughout his career, Brennan was frequently called upon to play characters considerably older than he was. The loss of many teeth in the 1932 accident, rapidly thinning hair, thin build, and unusual vocal intonations all made him seem older than he was. He used these features to great effect. In many of his film roles, Brennan wore dentures; in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940) – a film set in the late 18th century – he wore a dental prosthesis which made him appear to have rotting and broken teeth. Brennan was billed third in &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; after Spencer Tracy and Robert Young.

Zanuck at Fox announced he wanted to make &quot;The Man from Home&quot;, once a vehicle for Will Rogers, with Brennan. Instead Brennan was top-billed in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Maryland&quot; (1940), an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;Kentucky&quot;. Brennan said he had been working constantly since Christmas 1937. &quot;I&#x27;m just plain punch drunk&quot;, he said.

===Third Oscar: &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940)===
Brennan had one of his best roles in Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940), playing the villainous Judge Roy Bean opposite Gary Cooper. William Wyler directed and the film earned Brennan his third Best Supporting Actor Oscar within a five-year span.

Goldwyn bought &quot;Trading Post&quot; as a vehicle for Brennan, but the film never materialized.

Brennan next supported Deanna Durbin in &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; (1941) and then Cooper again in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941) and Hawks&#x27; &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), a role that earned Brennan a fourth Oscar nomination. He could also be seen in &quot;This Woman is Mine&quot; (1941) as a sea captain.

Brennan played the top-billed lead in &quot;Swamp Water&quot; (1941), the first American film by director Jean Renoir. He appeared in &quot;Rise and Shine&quot; (1941) and then played reporter Sam Blake in &quot;Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942).

Brennan appeared in the war films &quot;Stand By for Action&quot; (1942) and &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), in which he played a Czech professor. He also appeared in &quot;Slightly Dangerous&quot; (1943), &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Tom Smith&quot; (1943) and Goldwyn&#x27;s Russian war epic &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943).

He was top-billed in a follow-up to &quot;Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; at Fox, &quot;Home in Indiana&quot; (1944).

Brennan was particularly skilled in playing the sidekick of the protagonist or the &quot;grumpy old man&quot; in films such as Hawks&#x27; &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944).

Brennan was a comic pirate in the Bob Hope film &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot; (1944). He was teamed with John Wayne for the first time since both men had obtained stardom in &quot;Dakota&quot; (1945), directed by Joseph Kane. He supported Bette Davis in &quot;A Stolen Life&quot; (1946) and appeared in the Fox musical &quot;Centennial Summer&quot; (1946).

===Western roles===
Brennan returned as a villain as Old Man Clanton in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), opposite Henry Fonda. He followed this with parts in &quot;Nobody Lives Forever&quot; (1946) at Warner Bros. and Republic&#x27;s &quot;Driftwood&quot; (1947).

He appeared in another Americana film at Fox, &quot;Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!&quot; (1948), and then in one of the greatest films in his career, &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), playing John Wayne&#x27;s sidekick.

After supporting Robert Mitchum in &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; (1948), he played another kindly father role in &quot;The Green Promise&quot; (1949). Brennan was billed second to Rod Cameron in &quot;Brimstone&quot; (1949), and he supported Gary Cooper in &quot;Task Force&quot; (1949).

Brennan focused on Westerns: &quot;Singing Guns&quot; (1950), &quot;A Ticket to Tomahawk&quot; (1950), &quot;Curtain Call at Cactus Creek&quot; (1950), &quot;The Showdown&quot; (1950), &quot;Surrender&quot; (1950), &quot;Along the Great Divide&quot; (1951), &quot;Best of the Badmen&quot; (1951) and &quot;Return of the Texan&quot; (1952).

He appeared in the war films &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (1951) and &quot;Lure of the Wilderness&quot; (1952), a remake of &quot;Swamp Water&quot; in which he reprised his role, although with less screen time than in the original film.

Brennan was in &quot;Sea of Lost Ships&quot; (1953) with John Derek, &quot;Drums Across the River&quot; (1954) with Audie Murphy, &quot;The Far Country&quot; (1954) with James Stewart and &quot;Four Guns to the Border&quot; (1954) with Rory Calhoun. He also appeared in &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955) for MGM.

==Later work==
===Television===
Brennan began to work on television, guest-starring on episodes of &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Ethel Barrymore Theater&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; and &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;. He played the old outlaw Joe in the 1956 episode &quot;Vengeance Canyon&quot; of &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;.

He appeared as himself as a musical judge in the 1953–1954 ABC series &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;. Brennan later said that he preferred television to films because there were not &quot;long layoffs between jobs.&quot;

He continued to appear in movies such as &quot;Gunpoint!&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Proud Ones&quot; (1956) and was in a short film about Israel, &quot;Man on a Bus&quot; (1955).

Brennan appeared in films such as &quot;Glory&quot; (1956), &quot;Come Next Spring&quot; (1956) and Batjac&#x27;s &quot;Good-bye My Lady&quot; (1956) with 14-year-old Brandon deWilde, with whom he recorded &quot;The Stories of Mark Twain&quot; that same year.

He appeared in &quot;The Way to the Gold&quot; (1957) and played Debbie Reynolds&#x27; grandfather in the romantic comedy &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot; (1957).

Brennan was given another lead role in &quot;God Is My Partner&quot; (1957), a low-budget film that became a surprise hit.

====&quot;The Real McCoys&quot;====

Brennan had resisted overtures to star in a regular TV series but relented for &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, a sitcom about a poor West Virginia family that relocated to a farm in Southern California. It was a hit and ran from 1957 to 1963.

Brennan continued to appear in films and other TV shows during the series&#x27; run such as &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot; and another Howard Hawks picture, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), supporting John Wayne and Dean Martin.

After five years on ABC, &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; switched to CBS for a final season. Brennan joined with series creator Irving Pincus to form Brennan-Westgate Productions. The series was coproduced with Danny Thomas&#x27;s Marterto Productions. It also featured Richard Crenna, Kathleen Nolan, Lydia Reed and Michael Winkelman.

For Brennan Productions, Brennan starred in &quot;Shoot Out at Big Sag&quot; (1962). He appeared as a villainous river pirate in MGM&#x27;s epic &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1963).

===Singing career===
Following Brennan&#x27;s success with &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, he performed on several recordings. The most popular of these was &quot;Old Rivers&quot;, a song about an old farmer and his mule. It was released as a single in 1962 by Liberty Records with &quot;The Epic Ride of John H. Glenn&quot; on the flip side. &quot;Old Rivers&quot; peaked at #5 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, making the 67 year-old Brennan the oldest living person to have a Top 40 hit at the time. At age 68, Brennan reached the Top 40 again, this time with &quot;Mama Sang a Song&quot; on November 17, 1962.

After &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; ended, Brennan provided the voice for a cartoon of &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGrew&quot;.

===Other TV roles and Disney===
Brennan starred as the wealthy executive Walter Andrews in the short-lived 1964–1965 ABC series &quot;The Tycoon&quot;, with Van Williams.

Brennan had a support part in &quot;Those Calloways&quot; (1965), his first Disney film, again paired with Brandon deWilde. He had a small role in &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966).

In 1967, he starred in another ABC series, &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot; (1967–1969), as an older man in search of his gunfighter son. It ran for two seasons.

Brennan was top-billed in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot; (1967) and made a pilot for the TV series &quot;Horatio Alger Jones&quot;, which did not become a series.

After a support role in &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Mint?&quot; (1967), he returned to Disney for &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; (1968).

Brennan had a part as the villain in &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; (1969) with James Garner.

===Later career===
Brennan received top billing over Pat O&#x27;Brien in the TV movie &quot;The Over-the-Hill Gang&quot; (1969) and Fred Astaire in &quot;The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again&quot; (1970).,

He joined the second season of the CBS sitcom &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; (1969–1971) with John Forsythe. This was Brennan&#x27;s last television series as a member of the permanent cast, although he did make a number of appearances on &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;.

Around this time he also starred in the TV movies &quot;The Young Country&quot; (1970), &quot;Two for the Money&quot; (1972) and &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1972). He was announced for a Western that was not made, &quot;One Day in Eden&quot;.

He started filming &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1973) for Disney but fell ill and was replaced.

Brennan&#x27;s last screen appearance was in the Western &quot;Smoke in the Wind&quot; (1975), directed by Joseph Kane.

==Personal life==

In 1920, Brennan married Ruth Caroline Wells. They had three children in their 54-year marriage: Arthur, Walter, and Ruth.

In 1940, Brennan purchased the 12,000-acre Lightning Creek Ranch, 20 miles north of Joseph, Oregon. He built the Indian Lodge Motel, a movie theater, and a variety store in Joseph, and continued retreating to the ranch between film roles until his death. Some members of his family continue to live in the area.

Brennan spent his last years mostly in retirement at his ranch in Moorpark in Ventura County, California. He died of emphysema on September 21, 1974, at the age of 80 in Oxnard, California. His remains were interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles.

=== Religious and political views ===
Brennan, a Roman Catholic, did not publicize his own religious affiliation, but declared in 1964, &quot;I&#x27;m too old not to be a religious fella... It appears we are losing something a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices for.&quot; That year, Brennan spoke at Project Prayer, a rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, hosted by Anthony Eisley, sought to flood Congress with letters in support of school prayer following two decisions by the Supreme Court in 1962 and 1963 that had invalidated the practice of mandatory prayer in public schools, which the court ruled to have conflicted with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

According to his biographer Carl Rollyson, Brennan was fiercely opposed to communism and reportedly branded people as communists if they supported John F. Kennedy. Rollyson wrote that Brennan &quot;thought that the Watts riots could have been stopped &#x27;with a machine gun&#x27;.&quot; Rollyson also reported that Brennan&#x27;s home &quot;included a bunker stocked with weapons and food in anticipation of a Soviet invasion.&quot; Brennan reportedly expressed satisfaction at the murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., much to the shock of the cast and crew of &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;, and also rejoiced in the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Everett Greenbaum, who wrote 32 episodes of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, described Brennan as a bigot who frequently uttered racist remarks.

A staunch conservative Republican and a member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, Brennan supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election because Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but Brennan later endorsed George Wallace in 1968, believing that Richard Nixon was too liberal for a Republican. In 1972, Brennan endorsed far-right candidate John Schmitz, who like Brennan, was a member of the John Birch Society. Brennan served as finance chairman and narrated advertisements in support of Schmitz&#x27;s campaign. Brennan also endorsed Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election and in his reelection in 1970.

== Legacy ==
Brennan was one of the greatest character actors in motion picture history. While the roles that he played were diverse, he may be best remembered for his portrayals in Western films such as those of Judge Roy Bean in &quot;The Westerner&quot;, trail hand Nadine Groot in &quot;Red River&quot; and Deputy Stumpy in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;. He was the first actor to win three Academy Awards and remains the only person to have won the Best Supporting Actor award three times. However, he remained somewhat embarrassed about how he had won the awards; in the early years of the Academy Awards, extras could vote, and Brennan was popular with the extras&#x27; union. His third win prompted the disenfranchisement of the union from Oscar voting. Following this change, Brennan failed to win the Oscar for his fourth Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1941 for &quot;Sergeant York&quot;. (The award went to Donald Crisp for &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; instead.)

Brennan played more than 230 film and television roles during a career that spanned nearly five decades. For his contributions to the film industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1970, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, where his photograph hangs prominently.

<text>Sir Frederick William Mallandaine Ashton (17 September 190418 August 1988) was a British ballet dancer and choreographer. He also worked as a director and choreographer in opera, film and revue.

Determined to be a dancer despite the opposition of his conventional middle-class family, Ashton was accepted as a pupil by Léonide Massine and then by Marie Rambert. In 1926 Rambert encouraged him to try his hand at choreography, and though he continued to dance professionally, with success, it was as a choreographer that he became famous.

Ashton was chief choreographer to Ninette de Valois, from 1935 until his retirement in 1963, in the company known successively as the Vic-Wells Ballet, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet and the Royal Ballet. He succeeded de Valois as director of the company, serving until his own retirement in 1970.

Ashton is widely credited with the creation of a specifically English genre of ballet. Among his best-known works are &quot;Façade&quot; (1931), &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; (1946), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1948), &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot; (1960), &quot;Monotones&quot; I and II (1965), &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; (1968) and the ballet film &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; (1971).

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Ashton was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the fourth of the five children of George Ashton (1864–1924) and his second wife, Georgiana (1869–1939), &quot;née&quot; Fulcher. George Ashton was manager of the Central and South American Cable Company and vice-consul at the British consulate in Guayaquil.

In 1907, the family moved to Lima, Peru, where Ashton attended a Dominican school. When they returned to Guayaquil in 1914, he attended a school for children of the English colony. One of his formative influences was serving as an altar boy, which inspired in him a love of ritual, as demonstrated in &quot;The Wise Virgins&quot;. Another, still more potent, influence was being taken to see Anna Pavlova dance in 1917. He was immediately determined that he would become a dancer.

Dancing was not a career acceptable to a conventional English family at that time. Ashton later recalled, &quot;My father was horrified. You can imagine the middle-class attitude. My mother would say, &#x27;He wants to go on the stage.&#x27; She could not bring herself to say &#x27;into the ballet.&#x27;&quot; Ashton&#x27;s father sent him to England in 1919 to Dover College, where he was miserable. Homosexual, and with an accent that his classmates laughed at, he did not fit in at a minor public school of the early 1920s.

He was not academically inclined, and his father decided that, upon leaving the school in 1921, Ashton should join a commercial company. He worked for an import–export firm in the City of London, where his ability to speak Spanish and French as well as English was an advantage. In January 1924, George Ashton committed suicide. His widow was left financially dependent on her elder sons, who ran a successful business in Guayaquil. She moved to London to be with Ashton and his younger sister, Edith.

===Massine and Rambert===

Despite family disapproval (and at first in secret) Ashton pursued his ambition to dance professionally. He auditioned for Léonide Massine; at the unusually late age of twenty he was accepted as a pupil. After Massine left London, Ashton was taken on as a student by Marie Rambert. She encouraged him to try choreographing. His first attempt was in 1926 for a revue staged by Nigel Playfair and Rambert&#x27;s husband Ashley Dukes. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented on &quot;an engaging little ballet called &quot;A Tragedy of Fashion: or The Scarlet Scissors&quot;, which Mr. Eugene Goossens has set most suitably to music. Miss Marie Rambert, as an impudently vivacious mannequin, and Mr. Frederick Ashton as a distracted man modist, lead the dancing. It is as chic a trifle as Mr Playfair&#x27;s modish establishment leads you to expect.&quot; The costumes and scenery were by Sophie Fedorovitch, who continued to work with Ashton for more than twenty years, and became, in his words, &quot;not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser&quot;.

Rambert sought to widen her students&#x27; horizons, taking them to see London performances by the Diaghilev Ballet. They had a great influence on Ashton—most particularly Bronislava Nijinska&#x27;s ballet &quot;Les biches&quot;. In 1930 Ashton created an innovative ballet, &quot;Capriol Suite&quot;, using Peter Warlock&#x27;s 1926 suite of the same name. The music was based on 16th-century French music, and Ashton researched the dances of the earlier era, and created a period piece with &quot;basse danse, pavane, tordion, and bransle—smoothly mixing robust masculine leaps with courtly duets.&quot; The following year Rambert founded the Ballet Club, forerunner of the Ballet Rambert, with Alicia Markova as prima ballerina and Ashton as the main choreographer and one of the leading dancers.

Ashton&#x27;s ballets of the early 1930s included &quot;La péri&quot; (1931), &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; (1931), &quot;Façade&quot; (1931), &quot;Foyer de danse&quot; (1932) and &quot;Les Masques&quot; (1933). He also contributed to West End revues and musicals, including &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1932) for C. B. Cochran, and &quot;Gay Hussar&quot; (1933), in which &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; singled out the &quot;spirited and lovely choreography in the classic manner&quot;.

===Vic-Wells===
Ashton&#x27;s association with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Vic-Wells Ballet, began in 1931, when he created a comic ballet, &quot;Regatta&quot; for her. It received mixed reviews; &quot;The Times&quot; thought it successful as &quot;a piece of flippant amusement&quot;, but &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered that &quot;it completely fails ... definitely a poor show&quot;. Nevertheless, Ashton was by now recognised as a choreographer of considerable talent and had gained a national, though not yet international, reputation.
In 1933 Ashton devised another work for de Valois and her company, the ballet-divertissement &quot;Les Rendezvous&quot;. Robert Greskovic describes the work as a &quot;classically precise yet frothy excursion showcas[ing] big skirted &#x27;ballet girls&#x27; and dashing swain partners&quot;. The piece was an immediate success, has been revived many times, and at 2013 remains in the Royal Ballet&#x27;s repertoire eighty years after its creation. In 1935 de Valois appointed Ashton as resident choreographer of her company, where he worked alongside Constant Lambert, the musical director from 1931 until 1947, and a company including Markova, Anton Dolin and Robert Helpmann. &quot;The Times&quot; describes Ashton&#x27;s first years with the Vic-Wells as a richly productive period: &quot;His &quot;Apparitions&quot; in 1936 was by many compared favourably with Massine&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; on a similar theme, and that year saw also the touching &quot;Nocturne&quot; to Delius&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. These works have vanished, but the following year&#x27;s witty &quot;A Wedding Bouquet&quot; and &quot;Les Patineurs&quot; are still with us.&quot;

In 1936–37, his homosexuality notwithstanding, Ashton had an affair with an American heiress and socialite, Alice von Hofmannsthal. After the affair ended, her love for him continued, though she had two subsequent marriages, both to gay Englishmen.

As the 1930s progressed, Ashton&#x27;s career began to extend internationally. In 1934 he choreographed Virgil Thomson&#x27;s opera &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; in New York, and in 1939 he created his first ballet for a foreign company: &quot;Devil&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (&quot;Le Diable s&#x27;amuse&quot;) for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. He continued to create dances for other forms of theatre, from revues such as &quot;The Town Talks&quot; and &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;, to opera, including Clive Carey&#x27;s production of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, and film, notably &quot;Escape Me Never&quot;, another collaboration with William Walton, following &quot;Façade&quot; four years earlier.

===Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Covent Garden===
Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War Ashton was offered a position in New York with what was to become the American Ballet Theatre. He declined, and returned to de Valois&#x27; company, soon renamed &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet&quot;. He created some works along more sombre lines, including &quot;Dante Sonata&quot;, which symbolised the unending struggle between the children of darkness and the children of light. In &quot;Ballet&quot; magazine, Lynette Halewood commented in 2000, &quot;No other work by Ashton is so disturbing and so bleak&quot;.

In 1941 Ashton was called up for war service. He was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Air Force, at first analysing aerial photographs and later as an intelligence officer. While in the RAF he was granted occasional spells of leave to carry on his work with the ballet. His collaboration with Walton continued with &quot;The Quest&quot; (1943). It was created and staged in a hurry, and Walton later said that it was not much of a success from anyone&#x27;s point of view. It had a theme of knightly chivalry, though Walton observed that Helpmann in the lead looked more like the Dragon than St George. As with the 1940 Ashton-Walton collaboration &quot;The Wise Virgins&quot;, the music has survived but the ballet has not.

After the end of the war David Webster invited de Valois to move her company from Sadler&#x27;s Wells to be resident at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden alongside the new opera company he was establishing. Ashton&#x27;s first ballet for the company in its new home was &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; (1946). The historian Montague Haltrecht writes of it, &quot;It is a masterpiece created for the Opera House and for the company&#x27;s dancers, and almost of itself defines a style of English dancing.&quot; Although the Covent Garden stage was much larger than that at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Ashton confined himself to six dancers, led by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes. The work, which remains in the repertoire as at 2013, was a success from the outset.

Another plotless ballet was &quot;Scènes de ballet&quot; (1947), which remains a repertoire piece. In 1948, at the urging of de Valois, Ashton created his first major three-act ballet for a British company, his version of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. The original cast included Moira Shearer as Cinderella, Somes as the Prince, Alexander Grant as the jester, and Ashton and Helpmann &quot;en travesti&quot; as Cinderella&#x27;s stepsisters. Some critics have commented that Ashton was not yet fully in control of a full-length ballet, with intermittent weaknesses in the choreography, but the comedy of the stepsisters was, and has remained, a favourite with audiences. The ballet critic Laura Jacobs called it &quot;slapstick of a celestial order&quot;, and recalled that she and her fellow New York critics were &quot;struck speechless by this luminous ballet&quot;.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s Ashton worked more frequently for other ballet companies, creating works for the Ballets de Paris (&quot;Le Rêve de Léonor&quot;, 1949, to Britten&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Variations&quot;) and the New York City Ballet (&quot;Illuminations&quot;, 1950, to Britten&#x27;s &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;, and &quot;Picnic at Tintagel&quot;, 1952, to Bax&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of Fand&quot;). He created dances for films, including &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953), and directed operas at Glyndebourne (Britten&#x27;s &quot;Albert Herring&quot;, 1947) and Covent Garden (Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, 1947, and Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus&quot;, 1953, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli with Kathleen Ferrier in the title role).

Ashton&#x27;s second full-length ballet for de Valois&#x27; company was &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1952). Ashton&#x27;s biographer Kathrine Sorley Walker considers that it works &quot;even less well&quot; than &quot;Cinderella&quot;, but contemporary reviews praised it with little or no reservation. In 2005, reviewing a New York revival, the critic Jennie Schulman called it a &quot;blockbuster&quot;, &quot;radiant&quot; with &quot;choreographic abundance to please even the most finicky of gods and the most demanding of balletomanes&quot;.

Ashton&#x27;s third full-length ballet was &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955. It was a considerable success, but Ashton resisted attempts to present it at Covent Garden, which he thought too large a theatre and stage for his intimate treatment of the story. It was not seen in London until 1985 when it was produced by the London Festival Ballet rather than at Covent Garden.

===Royal Ballet===
In October 1956 Elizabeth II granted Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet a charter, giving it the title of &quot;the Royal Ballet&quot; with effect from 15 January 1957. This recognised the eminence the company had achieved: internationally it was widely regarded as &quot;the leading company outside Russia&quot;. De Valois remained the director of the company, with Ashton as principal choreographer.
One of Ashton&#x27;s most celebrated ballets was created for the Royal Ballet in 1960: &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot;. The first ballet of that title had been presented in France in 1789, and several later versions had been staged in the 19th century, using music by various composers. Ashton did his customary careful research and decided to make use of Ferdinand Hérold&#x27;s music (1828), arranged, with additions from other versions, by John Lanchbery. Walker says of the work, &quot;He adhered closely to the original scenario, but created deliciously inventive new choreography that was the happiest amalgam of classical ballet and English folk-dance, while Osbert Lancaster&#x27;s delightful designs were firmly related to French country life.&quot; It was an immediate success, and has been regularly staged since, not only by the Royal Ballet, but by companies in ten other European countries and in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa and the US.

When de Valois retired in 1963, Ashton succeeded her as director. His time in charge was looked on as something of a golden age. Under him, the corps de ballet was recognised as rivalling and even excelling the best anywhere else in the world. He continued to add to the repertoire with his own new productions, he persuaded his former mentor Bronislava Nijinska to revive her &quot;Les biches&quot; and &quot;Les noces&quot;, and he presented &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Angot&quot; by his other mentor, Massine. He also brought in Antony Tudor, his English contemporary, better known in the US, to stage both new and old works. The ballet critic John Percival considered that despite the numerous glories of the company under Ashton&#x27;s directorship, he was unsuited to and uninterested in management, and lacked de Valois&#x27; gift for strategic planning (though better in both these regards than his successor as director, Kenneth MacMillan). Percival believed that this weakened the company in the long term. Ashton&#x27;s works for the company while he was director included &quot;The Dream&quot; (1964) (for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley), the pas de trois &quot;Monotones II&quot; (1965), &quot;Jazz Calendar&quot; (1968) and &quot;Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within)&quot; (1968).

Webster, due to retire in 1970 as general administrator of the Royal Opera House, decided that his departure should be accompanied by a change to the leadership of the two companies. Georg Solti, musical director of the opera company, was keen to concentrate on his new post as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and did not wish to renew his Covent Garden contract when it expired in 1971. Ashton had frequently told colleagues how he looked forward to his own retirement, but nonetheless was hurt by the abruptness with which his departure was arranged and announced by Webster. He stood down in July 1970 after a farewell gala organised by Michael Somes, John Hart and Leslie Edwards.

After his retirement, Ashton made several short ballets as &quot;pièces d&#x27;occasion&quot;, but his only longer works were the cinema film, &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; made in 1970 and released in 1971, and &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1976), a one-act piece, lasting about forty minutes, freely adapted from Turgenev&#x27;s comedy of manners. The piece has been revived regularly, in every decade since the premiere.

Ashton&#x27;s last years were marred by the death of his partner, Martyn Thomas, in a car crash in 1985 – a blow from which Ashton never fully recovered. He died in his sleep on 19 August 1988, at his country home in Suffolk, and was buried on 24 August at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Yaxley, Suffolk.

===The Fred Step===
Ashton included in many of his ballets a signature step, known to dancers as &quot;the Fred step&quot;. It is defined by David Vaughan as &quot;&quot;. Adrian Grater has enlarged the definition to include the transitional movements; this in Benesh notation is transcribed thus:

It was based on a step used by Anna Pavlova in a gavotte that she frequently performed. Alicia Markova recalled in 1994 that Ashton had first used the step in a short ballet that concluded Nigel Playfair&#x27;s 1930 production of &quot;Marriage à la Mode&quot;. It is not seen in Ashton&#x27;s 1931 &quot;Façade&quot;, but after that, it became a feature of his choreography. The critic Alastair Macaulay writes:

Ashton himself danced the step as the timorous sister in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and later he and Fonteyn danced a gentle version of it together in &quot;Salut d&#x27;amour&quot;, created by Ashton for her sixtieth birthday gala at Covent Garden. The Royal Ballet has a demonstration of the step on its website, explained by the company&#x27;s ballet mistress, Ursula Hageli and danced by Romany Pajdak.

==Legacy==
Ashton left the rights to many of his ballets to friends and colleagues, including Fonteyn (&quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; and &quot;Ondine&quot;), Dowell (&quot;The Dream&quot; and &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;), Michael Somes (&quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;), Alexander Grant (&quot;La fille mal gardée&quot; and &quot;Façade&quot;), Antony Dyson (&quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and &quot;Monotones&quot;), and Brian Shaw (&quot;Les Patineurs&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous&quot;). Rights to most of his other ballets were left to his nephew, Anthony Russell-Roberts, who was Administrative Director of the Royal Ballet from 1983 to 2009.

To perpetuate the legacy of Ashton and his ballets, the Frederick Ashton Foundation was set up in 2011. It is independent of, but works closely with, the Royal Ballet.

==Honours==
Ashton was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1950 Birthday Honours, knighted in the 1962 Birthday Honours, appointed Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1970 Birthday Honours for services to the ballet, and appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) in 1977.

His honours from other countries included the Legion of Honour (France, 1960) and the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark, 1964). He received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award from the Royal Academy of Dance in 1959. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London (1981), and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Durham (1962), East Anglia (1967), London (1970), Hull (1971) and Oxford (1976).

<text>The Supermarine Scimitar is a single-seat naval strike aircraft that was designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Supermarine. Operated exclusively by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, it was the final aircraft to be entirely designed and manufactured by Supermarine.

The Scimitar was developed out of an earlier effort, internally designated &quot;Type 505&quot;, an undercarriage-less fighter aircraft intended to be flown from rubber decks. Much of the aircraft&#x27;s features, including its unorthodox V-tail (or &quot;butterfly tail&quot;) and its thin straight wing, were shared with this ancestor; however, the Admiralty reconsidered their requirements and specified a conventional undercarriage be used. Accordingly, Supermarine produced the closely related &quot;Type 508&quot;, equipped with an enlarged wing and retractable undercarriage. On 31 August 1951, the Type 508 performed its maiden flight, it was closely followed by the redesigned &quot;Type 529&quot; and &quot;Type 544&quot;, the latter serving as a direct prototype for the production model, making its first flight in January 1956.

During 1957, the first production aircraft were delivered, enabling the Scimitar to enter service with the Royal Navy during the following year. The aircraft was operated by the Royal Navy as a low level strike aircraft, which included potentially being armed with nuclear weapons, having been superseded as a fighter even prior to its introduction by other aircraft such as the de Havilland Sea Venom and the de Havilland Sea Vixen. It experienced a relatively high attrition rate due to a spate of accidents. Towards its latter years of operation, the type was frequently used as an aerial refuelling tanker. During 1969, the Scimitar was permanently withdrawn, having been replaced in service by newer and more capable aircraft such as the Blackburn Buccaneer.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Scimitar stemmed from a number of designs produced by Supermarine for a naval jet aircraft. Work on what would eventually lead to the Scimitar officially commenced in 1945 following the release of a requirement for an undercarriage-less fighter aircraft, which was intended to land on flexible &quot;sprung&quot; rubber decks. According to aviation authors C. F. Andrews and E. B. Morgan, it was commonly believed amongst officials that such an arrangement would enable aircraft to be built with a lighter and simpler structure, and thus be capable of achieving greater performance in comparison to their conventional peers, particularly amongst those being operated from aircraft carriers. Specifically, the weight reduction achieved by eliminating the reinforced undercarriage used on naval aircraft would lead to substantially great rates of climb and acceleration. Seeking to keep the airframe compact and fairly lightweight, it was also desirable to adopt the most powerful powerplants available while restricting its diameter and thus its overall size; it was promptly determined that placing a pair of engines in a side-by-side configuration resulted in a relatively flat fuselage cross-section that generated favourable characteristics for undercarriage-less landings.

Supermarine&#x27;s design to meet this requirement, internally designated &quot;Type 505&quot;, featured an unusual V-tail (or &quot;butterfly tail&quot;) arrangement that kept the tail surfaces away from the jet exhausts. Pitch control was performed via movements of the whole tail, the elevators being capable of working in tandem to provide additional pitch control, while also replacing the rudder of a conventional tail when being worked differentially. Wide-chord ailerons were installed for lateral control while leading and trailing edge flaps were also fitted, including dive flaps to aid in recovery during high speed flight by restoring lift. A cockpit akin to the earlier Supermarine Attacker was positioned within the aircraft&#x27;s nose, it was pressurised to better facilitate flying at altitude. The powerplant selected was the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine, a pair of which being installed side by side within the fuselage; it was accessed via removable panels on the upper fuselage. A relatively thin wing could also be adopted, having been freed from the necessity of bearing elements of the undercarriage; while considerations towards a swept wing configuration were made, the option was discounted due to it presenting too many unknown factors at the time. Instead, a straight wing with a constant airfoil section was adopted; its leading edge section was as large as was feasible to minimise premature breakaway of airflow, a phenomenon that could lead to stalls.

===Redesign===
During 1948, the Admiralty had second thoughts about the undercarriage-less fighter, leading to Supermarine reworking their design by including a nosewheel undercarriage, the resulting redesign being designated the &quot;Type 508&quot;. This led to the adoption of a retractable nosewheel undercarriage; redesign work was aided by considerations that had already made for the installation of a conventional undercarriage upon the Type 505 during its initial test flights. Furthermore, the viable landing speed was also reduced at this time, necessitating various alterations, such as the wing thickness being increased from seven to nine percent for a higher lift coefficient, while the wing&#x27;s area was also expanded.

The Type 508 was the first Scimitar ancestor; it shared the broad layout of the unflown Type 505, both possessing a straight-wing paired with a V-tail and twin jet engines. The redesign was done in a manner that, if desired, an undercarriage-less configuration was still viable; furthermore, it was designed in such a manner that it could be readily adapted to Royal Air Force (RAF) requirements as well. The primary structural change between the two designs affected the wing spars, which were redirected underneath the engines to accommodate the undercarriage. During November 1947, Supermarine received an initial order for three Type 508s to fulfil Specification N.9/47.

===Into flight===
On 31 August 1951, the first Type 508 performed its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down; by May 1952, the aircraft had commenced carrier-based trials aboard HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;. The second aircraft featured significant differences, carrying a cannon armament and was different enough in detail to be renamed the &quot;Type 529&quot;. It flew for the first time on 29 August 1952. One unusual modification was the larger tailcone, which had been implemented so that a proposed tail-warning radar could be accommodated. The maximum speed of the straight-winged Type 508 and 529 was relatively modest, with the Type 529 reaching 607 mph (977 km/h) and it had already been decided when the Type 508 first flew, to redesign the third prototype with swept wings to improve performance. The resulting Type 525 also featured conventional swept tail surfaces as well as blown flaps to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s landing speed and first flew on 27 April 1954.

While the aircraft was subsequently lost as a result of a crash, numerous favourable performance improvements had been observed, including a reduction in its stalling speed, a reduced angle of attack, increased stability and control at low speeds, and more stable airflow over the wing&#x27;s trailing edge. Thus, the basic design was considered to have been sufficiently proved to the extent that officials decided to proceed with an outwardly fairly similar looking aircraft, the &quot;Type 544&quot;, to fulfil Specification N.113. A total of 100 aircraft were ordered, although the Royal Navy had changed the specification to a low level strike aircraft with nuclear capability, despite having originally been designed as a fighter.

The first of the Type 544s, serving as prototypes for the later production series, flew on 19 January 1956. The aircraft evolved more with the third Type 544, incorporating different aerodynamic changes and a stronger airframe for the new low level role - to quote &quot;Flight&quot;; &quot;To permit uninhibited manoeuvring in thick turbulent air at low levels while carrying heavy loads of strike weapons, the structure is extremely sturdy&quot;. Various aerodynamic &quot;fixes&quot; were implemented in an effort to counter undesirable pitch-up effects present during high speed flight and at high altitudes; these included flared-out wing tips and wing fences, while the tailplane was also changed from dihedral to anhedral. These combined modifications led to the final Type 544 being considered the &quot;production standard&quot;. The first production Scimitar flew on 11 January 1957.

The Scimitar pioneered fuel flow proportioning and integral main-plane tanks, along with &quot;blown&quot; flying surfaces to reduce landing speeds. It also featured the first use of duplicated fully-powered flight controls by a British naval aircraft.

==Operational history==
At the point of its introduction, the Scimitar was the largest, heaviest and most powerful aircraft to have entered service with the Fleet Air Arm. In June 1958, operational training on the type commenced with 803 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Lossiemouth, prior to their embarkment upon the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; during September of that year. Multiple squadrons formed around the Scimitar shortly thereafter, leading to its use upon the carriers HMS &quot;Ark Royal, HMS &quot;Centaur&quot;, HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; and HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; as well.

Early on in the Scimitar&#x27;s flying career, the majority of the Royal Navy&#x27;s carriers were relatively small while the Scimitar was a comparatively large and powerful aircraft. This combination likely contributed heavily to the frequent landing accidents with the type; perhaps the most high profile of these occurred during the type&#x27;s introduction. It was a fatal accident, taking the life of Commander John Russell, commanding officer of 803 Naval Air Squadron, the first squadron to operate the Scimitar. Overall the Scimitar suffered from a high loss rate; 39 were lost in a number of accidents, amounting to 51% of the Scimitar&#x27;s production run.

Although the Scimitar could operate as a fighter, the interceptor role was covered by the de Havilland Sea Venom and then the de Havilland Sea Vixen. The Scimitar itself was replaced by the Blackburn Buccaneer. It was kept initially as a tanker to allow the underpowered Buccaneer S.1 to be launched from aircraft carriers with a useful weapons load. To save weight, the Buccaneer would take off with a reduced fuel load then refuel from a Scimitar immediately after. Late in the Scimitar&#x27;s operational career, 16 examples were flown between 1965 and 1970 by the Fleet Requirements Unit (FRU) based at Bournemouth Airport (Hurn). The FRU was managed by Airwork Services and provided realistic flight operations for land and sea-based naval training units.

==Accidents==

* 25 September 1958: When landing on the newly recommissioned and in full view of the press, one of the arrestor wires broke, causing the Scimitar (serial XD240) of Commander John Russell (commanding officer of 803 Naval Air Squadron) to fall into the sea. With no means of ejecting through the canopy and despite the best efforts of the crew of the Westland Whirlwind planeguard helicopter to rescue him, Russell drowned as his Scimitar sank to the bottom. The incident was later broadcast by British Pathé News. When the aircraft was recovered, it was found that Russell had managed to open the canopy after the aircraft sank, but had been prevented from successfully escaping due to being tethered by ejector seat leg straps and the dinghy lanyard.
* 19 November 1958: After losing altitude over Black Isle, Sublieutenant C.R. Cresswell ejected from his Scimitar (serial XD247). However, his parachute only partially opened and he plummeted into the ground. The Scimitar crashed approximately two miles from his landing location. He was taken to the nearby Raigmore Hospital, where he died of his injuries the following day.

<text>The University of Patras (UPatras; , &quot;Panepistímio Patrón&quot;) is a public university in Patras, Greece. It is the third-largest university in Greece with respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments.

The University of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas.

In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level). It has 715 faculty members, 234 scientific staff members and 429 administrative personnel and comprises seven schools and thirty-one departments.

== History ==
The University of Patras was established on 11 November 1964 as a self-administered academic institution under the supervision of the Greek government. It was housed in the city centre of Patras, Greece, and later in a campus area of about 600 acres selected in 1968 and appropriated on behalf of the university, located in the adjacent municipality of Rio. Covering an area of 4.5 km2, it is one of the largest in the country.

In June 2013 the University of Western Greece was incorporated in the University of Patras. In 2019 the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece was incorporated in the University of Patras. After the merger of the university with the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece, there are two main campuses (two in Patras) and smaller campuses/facilities in Messolonghi and Agrinio. The campus in Patras is located in the suburb of Rion and Koukouli. 

Besides education, the University of Patras is involved in research in areas such as environment, health, biotechnology, mechanics, electronics, informatics and basic science. A number of the university&#x27;s departments, laboratories and clinics have been designated as centres of excellence, on the basis of international assessment.

==Emblem==
The emblem of the university is Andrew the Apostle. The university&#x27;s opening took place on 30 November 1966, which is the date that the city of Patras celebrates its patron Saint Andrew. This is the reason that the emblem of the university is an X cross,l which symbolises the one on which St. Andrew was crucified. In 2012, the emblem was renewed but it remained true to the prototype.

== Academic profile ==
The university consists of seven schools, thirty one departments with undergraduate study programs leading to a degree.

Furthermore, the University of Patras offers postgraduate programs, as well as digital and open courses.

== Research ==
In its 180 laboratories, research is conducted by students and teaching staff members.

Apart from regular teaching and research activities, the laboratories are the focal points for the creation of national and international research consortia. The university participates in all major European research programmes.

The management of research projects is carried out by the Research Committee and its administration unit. The financial management of research projects with external funding produces resources for the university, which are used for specific educational and developmental activities, as well as funding of researchers. In recent years, over 2700 research projects, financed both by the state and the European Union have been carried out.

The University of Patras collaborated with the Libre Space Foundation to launch UPSat in 2017, the first satellite manufactured in Greece and the first satellite in history made entirely with open-source software and open-source hardware. It was a cubesat launched from the International Space Station that participated in the QB50 mission to study Earth&#x27;s thermosphere.

== Academic evaluation ==
An external evaluation of all academic departments in Greek universities was conducted by the Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQA).

In 2015 the external evaluation committee gave University of Patras a &quot;Positive evaluation&quot;.

== Location and campus ==


The campuses of Patras are situated in the suburb Rion which is 7 km north east of the City of Patras within the Municipality of Patras, and at Koukouli, Patras. Departments of the University of Patras are located in the cities of Messolonghi and Agrinio.

The &quot;campus of Rion&quot; is located next to the University Regional General Hospital of Patras. It is a self-contained campus.

The university&#x27;s campus in Rion has four entrances. The track and field and sporting grounds are in the southern part.

The first buildings of the university campus of Rion were a unit of 20 small ground level pre-fabricated buildings, still housing some academic and administrative offices. In 1972 the construction of buildings &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; started. Building &quot;A&quot; houses the administrative services, the rectorship, the Senate&#x27;s Conference Hall, the university&#x27;s Ceremonial Hall, a teaching amphitheatre and seminar halls.

Following the master plan, 25 buildings were eventually built, along with a new library, and many more are under construction for the housing of most of the departments, a museum of science and technology, a botanical garden, and a new student centre. Within the campus there are also found the Students&#x27; Residence Hall, the Conference and Cultural Centre, a restaurant, a bank, a bookstore, the university&#x27;s publishing house, cafeterias and kiosks. The University Conference Centre is the only building of the university outside the campus. It is located three kilometres west of the campus. The campus has not been completed yet.

Within the campus of Rion there is also the Regional University Teaching Hospital which functions both as the major regional medical centre and as a teaching facility for the Faculty of Medicine.

Concurrently there is a continuous effort to upgrade and improve the landscape within the campus, although extensive infrastructure projects, landscaping and athletic facilities have been completed. Several other facilities are available on campus including a gymnasium, a post-office, a swimming pool, a nursery school, a primary and secondary school for the children of the academic faculty and administrative personnel.

In addition to constructing new buildings, new sites at the surroundings have been appropriated on behalf of the university. The campus of Rion has many open-spaces, green shady areas covered with characteristically Mediterranean olive groves.

It is notable for having two of the largest living kauri trees, &quot;Tāne Mahuta&quot; and &quot;Te Matua Ngahere&quot;.

The forest was declared a sanctuary in 1952. A community-based volunteer organisation, the Waipoua Forest Trust, helps maintain the forest. The sanctuary is bordered to the south by the Professor W.R McGregor Reserve, named after W. R. McGregor (1894–1977).
In the 1940s, McGregor, and others, successfully campaigned to end logging of the forest and to have it declared a sanctuary, a status it achieved in 1952.

Approximately 200,000 people visit Tāne Mahuta every year. This has led to concerns about the health of the forest and the spread of kauri dieback disease.

==Ecology==

The Waipoua, Warawara and Puketi forests together contain about three quarters of New Zealand&#x27;s remaining mature kauri trees.
The Waipoua forest holds the largest remaining stand of these trees.
It contains Te Matua Ngahere, a notable kauri tree that is the largest in New Zealand by girth and the second largest by volume, and is estimated to be from 2,000 to 3,000 years old.
The trees are threatened by the fungus Phytophthora taxon Agathis.
The Waipoua Forest Trust has called for urgent action by the government to find a cure for the problem.
The forest has the largest population of North Island brown kiwi in Northland. Populations of the endangered North Island kōkako can be found in the high plateau country.

A forest fire threatened Waipoua Forest when it broke out on 1 February 2007 after someone had been cooking mussels on an open fire at a nearby beach. The fire burnt pine plantation adjoining the native forest, but destroyed ecologically significant wetland vegetation, and came within of the iconic Tāne Mahuta. The blaze was fought by local fire fighters and conservation volunteers, who managed to stop its spread using helicopters and fire breaks. Millions of dollars of pine, and many endangered birds, were lost, including an estimated 20 North Island brown kiwi. In all the fire claimed over of vegetation.

==History==

The Waipoua Forest was bought from Māori namely Tiopira Kinaka (Te Roroa) and Parore Te Awha (Te Kuihi) as part of the Waipoua Block No.1 in 1876 for a little over £2,000. At the time it covered about .

In 1885 the Waipoua Forest came under the provision of the State Forests Act, and an area of 90 km² was constituted a State Forest Reserve.
One of the reasons for its escape from destruction in earlier days was its remoteness combined with the difficulty of extracting its timber. Another was, that like the Warawara to the North, rainfall was more consistent and abundant so that Māori and European fires had not engulfed it (as happened to the Kaihu, Puhipuhi and large parts of the Coromandel forest in the 1870s and 1880s).

In 1907 the Waipoua Forest, the Warawara forest and one or two other smaller reserves were the only virgin kauri forests left belonging to the state.
In 1913 a Royal Commission on Forestry recommended that a specially selected area of of the Waipoua Forest, and the whole of the Warawara Forest of , be established as national kauri forests for the people of New Zealand.
In 1926 a road was put through Waipoua Forest to provide access to the lands of neighbouring settlers.

In the 1940s it became known that the State Forest Service was cutting kauri at Waipoua. In 1947 the Whangarei Progressive Society, in association with the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, the Waipoua Preservation Society, and other organisations secured more than 43,000 signatures on a petition asking for the &#x27;declaration of the Waipoua State Forest as a national park under a board of trust, and that all milling and other state forest activities should cease&#x27;. The petition consisted of thirteen volumes of signatures, which was presented by the MP for Marsden, AJ Murdoch in a wheelbarrow to parliament on 25 September 1947. Its hope was that at Waipoua should be set aside for all time, inviolate from interference by man. Other petitions followed, and on 2 July 1952 an area of over was proclaimed a forest sanctuary.
The zoologist William Roy McGregor was one of the driving forces in this movement, writing an 80-page illustrated pamphlet on the subject, which proved an effective manifesto for conservation.

In the late 1960s, in violation of the 1913 recommendations, adopted de facto, the National Government initiated clear felling in the Warawara forest. This was not stopped until 1972 following a large public outcry and fulfilment of an election promise of the incoming Labor Government. In this short period, approximately 1/5 of the forest was felled (about 1/4 by timber volume).

==Waipoua Forest Trust==
Waipoua Forest Trust is a community-based environmental organisation that was set up in 1999 to protect the kauri forests in the Waipoua area.
The Trust is a joint partnership between the Native Forests Restoration Trust and Te Roroa, the Māori guardians of Waipoua.
The two organisations help guide the Department of Conservation in its management role.

===Property===

In March 2000 the New Zealand Minister of Internal Affairs, Mark Burton, launched the Millennium Kauri Forest to the south of the Waipoua Forest, giving a $1.4 million lottery grant and a gift of land title to the Waipoua Forest Trust.
Most of the money went towards further purchases of land to protect the southern boundaries of the forest.
The Trust co-operates with the Native Forests Restoration Trust, which operates the Professor McGregor Reserve. It has bought farmland to the north of the McGregor Reserve, helping preserve the southern boundary of the Waipoua catchment.
Through a Queen Elizabeth II National Trust covenant, the trust administers about 16 ha of the Marlborough Road forest to the south of the Waipoua reserve.

===Activities===

The trust is attempting to save the last of the ancient kauri trees, and to assist the wildlife in the park to recover.
The trust is actively engaged in reseeding and converting previously logged land to its original forested state and is also working on establishing a kiwi hatchery.
Awareness has been made through a photographic display at the Kauri Museum at Matakohe.
The ASB Community Trust granted the Waipoua Forest Trust $810,000 in 2007.

Volunteers engage in weeding previously planted areas, maintaining the ground, collecting flax seed, and monitoring and eradicating pests such as rats and possums.
As of June 2007 the trust had invested more than NZ $4 million in land protection and restoration.
The trust has been supported by Kaipara District council in its application to the Ministry for the Environment for funding to replant areas within the Domain with indigenous vegetation.
In November 2007 the trust raised an outcry over a decision by the Department of Conservation to cut down a 600-year-old kauri tree as part of a road widening project.

In April 2009, Alex Nathan, who is chairman of both Te Roroa Whatu Ora and Waipoua Forest trust, met with his counterpart from the Yakushima community in Japan, which has similar concerns about preserving ancient giant trees. The two leaders launched the &quot;Family of Ancient Trees&quot; project to raise mutual awareness and encourage eco-tourism.
The agreement followed a series of visits and talks between members of the trust and other concerned New Zealand groups and their opposite numbers in Japan.
In May 2009 the trust was one of the sponsors of the Waipoua Forest run, in which many Japanese visitors participated.

<doc id="477184" wikidata="Q217764" url="?curid=477184" title="Maurice Béjart">
<text>Maurice Béjart (; 1 January 1927 – 22 November 2007) was a French dancer, choreographer and opera director who ran the Béjart Ballet Lausanne in Switzerland. He developed a popular expressionistic form of modern ballet, tackling vast themes. He was awarded Swiss citizenship posthumously.

==Biography==
Maurice-Jean Berger was born in Marseille, France, in 1927, the son of French philosopher Gaston Berger. Fascinated by a recital of Serge Lifar, he decided to devote himself entirely to dance. In South France days, he had studied under Mathilde Kschessinska.

In 1945, he enrolled as a corps de ballet at the Opéra de Marseille. From 1946, he had studied under Madam Rousanne Sarkissian, Léo Staats, Madam Lyubov Yegorova and Olga Preobrajenska at &quot;Studio Wacker&quot;, etc. in Paris.

In 1948, he also trained with Janine Charrat, Yvette Chauviré and then with Roland Petit, in addition he had studied under Vera Volkova at London.

In 1954, he founded the Ballet de l&#x27;Étoile company (dissolved in 1957). In 1960 he founded the Ballet du XXe Siècle in Brussels (dissolved in 1987).

In 1973, with the Ballet du XXe siecle, he premiered &quot;Golestan&quot;, on a poem by Sa&#x27;di, based on Iranian traditional music. The ballet was commissioned by the Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of Arts where it was premiered. The first performance of &quot;Improvisation sur Mallarme III&quot; with music by Boulez also took place at that Festival in 1973. &quot;Farah&quot;, also based on Iranian traditional music was the Ballet&#x27;s own commission, premiered in Brussels in 1976 and brought to the Shiraz-Persepolis Festival that same year. The 1976 Festival also witnessed the first performance of &quot;Heliogabalus&quot;, based on a poem by Artaud. The Festival&#x27;s patron was Farah Pahlavi, the former Empress of Iran, with whom Béjart kept strong ties to the end.
In 1987 he moved to Lausanne in Switzerland, where he founded the Béjart Ballet Lausanne. 

Among his works is a thoroughly revised version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, presumably inspired by his own life story, which he staged in 2000. It still uses Tchaikovsky&#x27;s original score, but completely scraps the original plot and characters, instead supplying a new story about a boy&#x27;s efforts to re-connect with his mother. We also are given a look into the boy&#x27;s strange sexual fantasies. The production design is full of erotic images — some of which are most likely shocking to many, such as wombs and vaginal openings. One of the characters is Marius Petipa, who becomes Mephisto. Another character is called Felix the Cat, presumably after the famous cartoon character. The production has been issued on DVD.

==Boléro==
One of Béjart&#x27;s masterpiece works of dance was choreography he set to French composer Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jennifer Dunning described Béjart&#x27;s &quot;Bolero&quot; as &quot;probably his best known and most popular dance.&quot; Created in 1960 for the Yugoslav ballerina Duška Sifnios, the dance features a dancer on a tabletop, surrounded by seated men, who slowly participate in the dance, culminating in a climactic union of the dancers atop the table. Dancers who would later perform Béjart&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Bolero&quot; include Sylvie Guillem from the Paris Opera Ballet, Grazia Galante, Maya Plisetskaya, Angele Albrecht, and Roberto Bolle. In a twist, Jorge Donn also played the role of the principal dancer, becoming the first male to do so. One of Donn&#x27;s such performances can be seen in French filmmaker Claude Lelouch&#x27;s 1981 musical epic, &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot;.

==Dance schools==
Béjart was the founder of several dance schools:
*the Mudra School in Brussels, 1970–1988;
*the Mudra Afrique School in Dakar, 1977–1985;
*the Rudra School in Lausanne, 1992–2007.

==Awards==
During his lifetime, Béjart received many awards and distinctions for his contributions to the arts.

* He received the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun.
* He received the Belgian Ordre de la Couronne.
* In 1974, he won the Erasmus Prize.
* In 1994, he was appointed to the Académie des Beaux Arts.
* Also in 1994, he received the Deutscher Tanzpreis.
* In 2003, he was appointed Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres.
* Also in 2003, he won the Prix Benois de la Danse for lifetime achievement.

<doc id="477185" wikidata="Q314312" url="?curid=477185" title="Michel Fokine">
<text>Michael Fokine ( – 22 August 1942) was a Russian choreographer and dancer.

==Career==
===Early years===

Fokine was born in Saint Petersburg to a prosperous merchant and at the age of 9 was accepted into the Saint Petersburg Imperial Ballet School. That same year, he made his performing debut in &quot;The Talisman&quot; under the direction of Marius Petipa. In 1898, on his 18th birthday, he debuted on the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in &quot;Paquita&quot;, with the Imperial Russian Ballet. In addition to being a talented dancer, Fokine was also passionate about painting and displayed talent in this area as well. He also played musical instruments, including mandolin (played on stage in ensemble led by Ginislao Paris), domra, and balalaika (played in Vasily Andreyev&#x27;s Great Russian Orchestra).

===Transition to choreographer===
He became frustrated with the life of a dancer and began considering other paths, including painting. In 1902, he was offered a teaching position at the Imperial Ballet School and was able to explore the artistic possibilities of choreography. In 1905, he created his first full-length ballet, &quot;Acis et Galatée&quot;, which was performed by his students and based on a Sicilian legend. Among his students were Desha Delteil and Bronislava Nijinska. 

Some of Fokine&#x27;s early works include the ballet &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; (1907), which was a solo dance for Anna Pavlova choreographed to the music of &quot;Le Cygne&quot;. &quot;Acis and Galetea&quot; included an acrobatic dance with young boys playing fauns, one of whom was Vaslav Nijinsky. Fokine later featured Nijinsky in ballets including &quot;Chopiniana&quot; (1907), which was renamed in 1909.

===Ballets Russes===
In 1909, Sergei Diaghilev invited Fokine to become the resident choreographer of the first season of the Ballets Russes in Paris. At Ballets Russes, he collaborated with other artists to create a ballet of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, which premiered in 1910. The ballet was inspired by symphonic poems composed by Rimsky-Korsakov and the tale of the 1001 Nights. The sets designed by Léon Bakst matched the sexualized choreography. Despite the lack of historical accuracy, the ballet was successful due to its brilliant colors, exoticism, and sexual overtones. The 1910 production featured Nijinsky in the role of the Golden Slave.

&quot;The Firebird&quot; (1910), with music composed by Igor Stravinsky was also created by a &quot;committee,&quot; a process inspired by the Wagnerian notion of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, which is the synthesis of elements such as music, drama, spectacle, and dance to create a more cohesive artwork. &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1912), with music also composed by Stravinsky and set design by Alexandre Benois Petrouchka, was inspired by the Russian puppet which traditionally appeared at the Butter Week (Shrovetide) Fairs. In this ballet, Fokine included street dancers, peddlers, nursemaids, a performing bear, and a large ensemble of characters to complement the plot. The story was centered on the sinister Magician (Enrico Cecchetti) and his three puppets: Petrouchka (Nijinsky), the Ballerina (Tamara Karsavina) and the savage Moor (Alexander Orlov). Fokine&#x27;s ballet &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot; (1911) showcased Nijinsky as the spirit of the rose given to a young girl. Nijinsky&#x27;s exit featured a grand jeté out of the young girl&#x27;s bedroom window, timed so the audience would last see him suspended in mid-air. In 1912, Fokine created an adaptation of &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;. 

He left Ballets Russes in 1912. In 1914, Diaghilev convinced Fokine to return to Ballets Russes, where he then created the ballets &quot;Midas&quot;, &quot;Josephslegende&quot;, and &quot;Le Coq d&#x27;Or&quot;. The Paris premiere of &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; by Ballets Russes in 1914 was an opéra-ballet, guided by Fokine with set design by Natalia Goncharova.

===American Ballet Company===
The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, disrupted the established touring circuit, which included countries now on opposing sides. Many dancers, including Fokine, returned to their home countries. He moved to Sweden with his family in 1918, and later established his home in New York City, where he founded a ballet school in 1921, and continued to appear with his wife, Vera Fokina. One of his pupils was Patricia Bowman. By 1924, he organized the American Ballet Company, which performed regularly at the Metropolitan Opera House and toured the United States. His first piece for the company was the comedy &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, set to a score by Jacques Offenbach. 

His ballet was the first production at the American Ballet Theatre on 11 January 1940. In 1937, Fokine joined Wassily de Basil&#x27;s offshoot of the Ballets Russes, which was eventually named the Original Ballet Russe. Among the new works Fokine created during this period were &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (1938) and &quot;Paganini&quot; (1939). His choreography was featured with the company until 1941.

Fokine staged more than eighty ballets in Europe and the United States. His best-known works were &quot;Chopiniana&quot;, &quot;Le Carnaval&quot; (1910), and &quot;Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide&quot; (1907). His pieces are still performed internationally. The Mariinsky Ballet performed a retrospective of Fokine&#x27;s work at London&#x27;s Covent Garden in July 2011.

===Death===
Fokine died in New York on 22 August 1942, aged 62. In tribute to his death, seventeen ballet companies around the world performed simultaneously.

==Teaching methods and style==
Fokine aspired to move beyond traditional ballet, toward a method of utilizing ballet to communicate the natural beauty of Man. He did not believe virtuoso ballet techniques to symbolize anything, and thought they could be substituted with forms that better expressed emotions and themes. Fokine was a strong believer in the communicative power of dance and pushed for creativity that broke tradition, believing that tradition is often distinct from reality and fails to capture the entire spectrum of human emotions. He believed that unless movements are expressive, they are irrational and neither delightful nor tolerable.

Fokine also sought to strip ballets of their artificial technicality and outdated costumes. He believed that many of the ballets of his time used costumes and techniques that did not reflect the themes of the ballets. Fokine studied Greek and Egyptian art, including vase painting and sculpture, and incorporated these into his ballets. As a choreographer, he took ballerinas out of their pointe shoes when pointe did not serve any &quot;artistic purpose&quot;. He believed that &quot;pointe&quot; should be used when the dancing body desires to express a soaring and upward theme, rather than to flaunt the strength of dancers&#x27; feet. He presented this new idea to the Imperial Mariinsky Theater&#x27;s management, but did not win their support. One of Fokine&#x27;s requests was to have his dancers perform barefoot in his 1907 ballet &quot;Eunice&quot;. His request was denied, and Fokine had toes painted on the dancers&#x27; tights so they would appear to be barefoot.

He also experimented with shifting the emphasis of movement away from the lower body and towards the whole body, with freer use of the arms and torso and using each muscle with clear intention. In doing so, Fokine sought to unify motion with emotion and the body with the soul, bringing new life to the ballet as a language and an art.

In 1923, he choreographed the ballet &quot;Ajanta Frescoes&quot; for Anna Pavlova after she had been inspired by her visit to the Ajanta Caves.

<text>Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery ( ; ), officially the Sacred Autonomous Royal Monastery of Saint Catherine of the Holy and God-Trodden Mount Sinai, is a Christian monastery located in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. Located at the foot of Mount Sinai, it was built between 548 and 565, and is the world&#x27;s oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery. 

The monastery was built by the orders of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, enclosing what is claimed to be the burning bush seen by Moses. Centuries later, the purported body of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, said to have been found in the area, was taken to the monastery; Saint Catherine&#x27;s relics turned it into an important pilgrimage site, and the monastery was eventually renamed after the saint.

Controlled by the autonomous Church of Sinai, which is part of the wider Greek Orthodox Church, the monastery became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002 for its unique importance to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 

The monastery library holds unique and rare works, such as the Codex Sinaiticus and the Syriac Sinaiticus, as well as a collection of early Christian icons, including the earliest known depiction of Jesus as Christ Pantocrator.

Saint Catherine&#x27;s has as its backdrop the three mountains it lies near: Ras Sufsafeh (possibly the Biblical Mount Horeb, peak c. west); Jebel Arrenziyeb, peak c.1km south; and Mount Sinai (locally, , by tradition identified with the biblical Mount Sinai; peak south).

==Christian traditions==
The monastery was built around the location of what is traditionally considered to be the place of the burning bush seen by the Hebrew prophet Moses. Saint Catherine&#x27;s monastery also encloses the &quot;Well of Moses&quot;, where Moses is said to have met his future wife, Zipporah. The well is still today one of the monastery&#x27;s main sources of water. The site is considered sacred by the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Centuries after its foundation, the body of Saint Catherine of Alexandria was said to be found in a cave in the area. The relics of Saint Catherine, kept to this day inside the monastery, have made it a favourite site of pilgrimage. The patronal feast of the monastery is the Feast of the Transfiguration.

==History==
The oldest record of monastic life at Mount Sinai comes from the travel journal written in Latin by a pilgrim woman named Egeria (Etheria; Saint Sylvia of Aquitaine) about 381/2–386.

The monastery was built by order of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush (also known as &quot;Saint Helen&#x27;s Chapel&quot;) ordered to be built by Empress Consort Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the burning bush. The living bush on the grounds is purportedly the one seen by Moses. Structurally the monastery&#x27;s king post truss is the oldest known surviving roof truss in the world.

From the time of the First Crusade, the presence of Crusaders in the Sinai until 1270 spurred the interest of European Christians and increased the number of intrepid pilgrims who visited the monastery. The monastery was supported by its dependencies in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Crete, Cyprus and Constantinople. Throughout the Middle Ages, the monastery had a multiethnic profile, with monks of Arab, Greek, Syrian, Slavonic and Georgian origin. However, in the Ottoman period the monastic community became almost exclusively Greek, possibly due to the decline and depopulation of Transjordanian Christian towns. From the 1480s onwards, the Wallachian princes started sending out alms to the monastery.

A mosque was created by converting an existing chapel during the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171), which was in regular use until the era of the Mamluk Sultanate in the 13th century and is still in use today on special occasions. During the Ottoman Empire, the mosque was in desolate condition; it was restored in the early 20th century.

During the seventh century, the isolated Christian anchorites of the Sinai were eliminated: only the fortified monastery remained. The monastery is surrounded by the massive fortifications that have preserved it. Until the twentieth century, access was through a door high in the outer walls. 

The monastery, along with several dependencies in the area, constitute the entire Church of Sinai, which is headed by an archbishop, who is also the abbot of the monastery. The exact administrative status of the church within the Eastern Orthodox Church is ambiguous: by some, including the church itself, it is considered autocephalous, by others an autonomous church under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. The archbishop is traditionally consecrated by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem; in recent centuries he has usually resided in Cairo. During the period of the Crusades which was marked by bitterness between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, the monastery was patronized by both the Byzantine emperors and the rulers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and their respective courts.

Dominican theologian Felix Fabri visited the monastery in the 15th century and provided a detailed account of it. He also described the monastery&#x27;s gardens, noting the presence of &quot;tall fruit trees, salad herbs, grass, and grain,&quot; and mentioning &quot;more than three thousand olive trees, many fig-trees and pomegranates, and a store of almonds and other fruits.&quot; The olives were used to produce oil for lighting lamps and as a relish in the kitchen.
For most of the time of the Mamluk Sultanate the monastery was able to prosper, but as the sultanate started to decline, it went through a crisis. While there had been several hundred monks in the mid-14th century, a hundred years later there were only several dozens. Local Bedouin tribes started harassing the community, robbing their property of the Christian coastal village of Al-Tur and in 1505, the monastery was captured and sacked. Though the sultan demanded that the property be returned to the monks, the Mamluk government was unable to subdue the Bedouin nomads and preserve order. The German explorer Martin Baumgarten visited the monastery in 1507 and noticed its decline.

On April 18, 2017, an attack by the Islamic State group at a checkpoint near the Monastery killed one policeman and injured three police officers.

==Manuscripts and icons==
The monastery&#x27;s library, founded sometime between 527 and 565, is recognized by Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operating library. It preserves the world&#x27;s second-largest collection of early codices and manuscripts, outnumbered only by the Vatican Library. It contains Greek, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Syriac, Georgian, Arabic, Ethiopic/Ge‘ez, Latin, Armenian, and Church Slavonic manuscripts and books, along with very rare Hebrew and Coptic books.

In May 1844 and February 1859, Constantin von Tischendorf visited the monastery for research and discovered the Codex Sinaiticus, dating from the 4th century, at the time the oldest almost completely preserved manuscript of the Bible. The finding from 1859 left the monastery for Russia, in circumstances that had been long disputed. But in 2003 Russian scholars discovered the donation act for the manuscript signed by the Council of Cairo Metochion and Archbishop Callistratus on 13 November 1869. The monastery received 9000 rubles as a gift from Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Codex was sold by Stalin in 1933 to the British Museum and is now in the British Library, London, where it is on public display. Prior to September 1, 2009, a previously unseen fragment of Codex Sinaiticus was discovered in the monastery&#x27;s library, as well as among the New Finds of 1975. On other visits (1855, 1857) Constantin von Tischendorf also amassed their more valuable manuscripts (Greek, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Georgian, Syriac) and took them with him to St. Petersburg and Leipzig, where they are stored today.

In February 1892, Agnes S. Lewis discovered an early palimpsest manuscript of the Gospel in St Catherine Monastery&#x27;s library that became known as the Syriac Sinaiticus and it remains in the monastery&#x27;s possession. Agnes and her sister Margaret D. Gibson returned in 1893 with the Cambridge team of the two scholars that included their wives, and also J. Rendel Harris to photograph and transcribe the manuscript in its entirety, as well as to prepare the first catalogues of the Syriac and Arabic manuscripts. Only among the New Finds two additional palimpsest manuscripts came to light containing additional passages of the Old Syriac Gospels.

The Monastery also has a copy of the Ashtiname of Muhammad, in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad is claimed to have bestowed his protection upon the monastery.

Additionally, the monastery houses a copy of Mok&#x27;c&#x27;evay K&#x27;art&#x27;lisay, a collection of supplementary books of the Kartlis Cxovreba, dating from the 9th century.

The most important manuscripts have since been filmed or digitized, and so are accessible to scholars. With planning assistance from Ligatus, a research center of the University of the Arts London, the library was extensively renovated, reopening at the end of 2017.

=== Sinai Palimpsests Project ===
Since 2011, a team of imaging scientists and experienced scholars in the decipherment of palimpsest manuscripts from the U.S. and Europe have photographed, digitized, and studied the library&#x27;s collection of palimpsests during the international Sinai palimpsests project.

Palimpsests are notable for having been reused one or more times over the centuries. Since parchment was expensive and time-consuming to produce, monks would erase certain texts with orange juice or scrape them off and write over them. Though the original texts were once assumed to be lost, imaging scientists used narrowband multispectral imaging techniques and technologies to reveal features that were difficult to see with the human eye, including ink residues and small grooves in the parchment. These images have subsequently been digitized and are now freely available for research at the UCLA Library for scholarly use.

As of June 2018, at least more than 160 palimpsests were identified, with over 6,800 pages of texts recovered. The newer finds were discovered in a secluded storage area of the St George Tower in 1975. Highlights include &quot;108 pages of previously unknown Greek poems and the oldest-known recipe attributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates;&quot; additional folios for the transmission of the Old Syriac Gospels; two unattested witnesses of an early Christian apocryphal text the Dormition of Mary (Transitus Mariae) of which most of the Greek text is lost; a previously unknown martyrdom of Patriklos of Caesarea Maritima (Israel), one of the eleven followers of Pamphilus of Caesarea; some of the earliest known Georgian manuscripts; as well as insight into dead languages such as the previously hardly attested Caucasian Albanian and Christian Palestinian Aramaic, the local dialect of the early Byzantine period, with many unparalleled text witnesses.

==Works of art==
The complex houses irreplaceable works of art: mosaics, the best collection of early icons in the world, many in encaustic, as well as liturgical objects, chalices and reliquaries, and church buildings. The large icon collection begins with a few dating to the 5th (possibly) and 6th centuries, which are unique survivals; the monastery having been untouched by Byzantine iconoclasm, and never sacked. The oldest icon on an Old Testament theme is also preserved there. A project to catalogue the collections has been ongoing since the 1960s. The monastery was an important centre for the development of the hybrid style of Crusader art, and retains over 120 icons created in the style, by far the largest collection in existence. Many were evidently created by Latins, probably monks, based in or around the monastery in the 13th century.
