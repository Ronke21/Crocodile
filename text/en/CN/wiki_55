<text>The Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&amp;D) Company was a railroad that operated independently from 1847 until 1894, first in the U.S. state of Virginia, and later on of track in nine states.

Chartered on March 9, 1847, the railroad completed its line between Richmond and Danville in 1856. During the American Civil War, the railroad was a vital link between the Confederate capital of Richmond and the rest of the Confederacy. After the Civil War, the railroad grew to become the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company System.

Placed in receivership in 1892, the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company was sold in 1894 and conveyed into the new Southern Railway Company (later the Norfolk Southern Railway) in 1896 and 1897.

==History==

===Beginnings (1847-61)===
The new Richmond and Danville Railroad was championed by Whitmell P. Tunstall, a lawyer in Chatham, Virginia, who was also a member of the Virginia General Assembly. After many years, Tunstall secured a charter for the new railroad on March 9, 1847. In the same year, the state of Virginia took a 60% interest in the capital stock of the company, which it would hold until 1871.

Construction on the line began on January 31, 1848, under the supervision of Col. Andrew Talcott, who was later to become the Richmond and Danville&#x27;s general manager. By 1850, the new railroad had reached Coalfield Station, near the coal mines in an area known today as Midlothian in western Chesterfield County. There, it competed with the mule-powered Chesterfield Railroad, the first railroad established in Virginia. Lawsuits followed, but the older railroad was quickly supplanted by the competition. The Virginia General Assembly allowed the Richmond and Danville Railroad to buy the Chesterfield Railroad for as much as $200,000 in 1848.

By the end of 1851, the line had reached Jetersville in Amelia County. Two years later, it was completed to a point near Drakes Branch, and had been graded to South Boston in Halifax County. On May 16, 1856, the railroad had finished construction of the main line.

In 1856, the Richmond and Danville Railroad was long, with bridges over the James River, the Staunton River and the Dan River. Its stations included:

* Richmond
* Midlothian Coal Pits 
* Amelia Court House
* Jetersville 
* Jennings Ordinary
* Burkeville 
* Meherrin
* Keysville
* Mossingford, now Mossingford Road Virginia State Route 642, in Charlotte County. 
* Clover
* South Boston
* New&#x27;s Ferry in Halifax County
* Barksdale in Halifax County
* Ringgold
* Dan River
* Danville

===Civil War (1861–1865)===

Known as the &quot;first railroad war&quot;, the American Civil War devastated the South&#x27;s railroads and economy. In 1862, the Richmond and York River Railroad — acquired after the war by the R&amp;D — played a crucial role in George McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign.

In 1862, the R&amp;D employed 400 laborers, 50 train hands, 30 carpenters, and 20 blacksmiths. The railroad also employed 300 slaves, some of whom it owned and some whose labor it rented from local planters. If a rented slave was injured or killed, the railroad reimbursed his or her owner; in one instance, the R&amp;D paid $1,379.44 for a slave killed in an accident. Some enslaved women were put to work as maids in ladies&#x27; dining cars. 
The Richmond and Danville Railroad was an essential transportation link for the Confederacy throughout the war. It provided the production of south-central Virginia to Richmond. When the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad was cut in 1864, the R&amp;D&#x27;s connection with the Piedmont Railroad was the only remaining connection from Richmond to the rest of the South.

The Confederate Army was often handicapped by its inability to transport supplies efficiently from depots to forces in the field. In one case, the war forced the Confederate government to overrule objections by North Carolina. That state had blocked construction of a rail connection from Greensboro to Danville, fearing that post-war trade from North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont would continue to flow to Richmond via the R&amp;D. 
==== April 1865 ====
Following successful Union attacks on April 1, 1865, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee abandoned Petersburg and headed west and south in an attempt to join Gen. Joseph Johnston&#x27;s army in North Carolina.

After evacuating Richmond the next day, on April 2, 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet left Richmond on the R&amp;D. The departing Confederates set fire to the bridge across the James River between Richmond and Manchester. They traveled to Danville, where they attempted to set up a temporary government.

On reaching Amelia Court House during the morning of April 4, 1865, Lee searched the commissary stores, finding abundant ordnance but no food. Lee waited 24 hours in vain there for R&amp;D trains to arrive with badly needed supplies. Union cavalry, meanwhile, sped forward and cut the Richmond &amp; Danville at Jetersville. Lee had to abandon the railroad, and his army stumbled across rolling country towards Lynchburg. On the morning of April 9, 1865, Palm Sunday, Lee met Grant in the front parlor of Wilmer McLean&#x27;s home near Appomattox Court House to surrender.

===Reconstruction (1865–94)===


With the support of Virginia Governor Francis H. Pierpont, Algernon S. Buford became president of the R&amp;D on September 13, 1865. Repair work began on war-damaged tracks, including the bridge across the James River between Manchester and Richmond.

Over the next 20 years, Buford, Richmonder James H. Dooley, and other leaders extended the railroad&#x27;s trackage to 3,000 miles through construction and acquisition. Early acquisitions included the Piedmont Railroad in 1866 and a 25-year lease of the North Carolina Railroad in 1871.

In 1871, the Southern Railway Security Company acquired the 60 percent stake in the railroad held by the state of Virginia. Another large shareholder was the Pennsylvania Railroad.

In 1877, Buford joined with Andrew Talcott, Thomas Mann Talcott, and others to form the Bon Air Land and Improvement Company, a land investment that added a resort train stop in Bon Air six miles east of Richmond.

In 1880, control of the R&amp;D was acquired by William P. Clyde and interests that controlled the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Rail Road Company.

In 1881, the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company was organized to develop and expand the R&amp;D, whose charter limited its control of connecting railroads.

In 1882, the R&amp;D, along with the North Carolina Railroad, Northwestern North Carolina Railroad, Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, Atlanta and Charlotte Air-Line Railway and the Columbia and Greenville Railroad lines were being operated as the Piedmont Air-Line System advertised as the shortest line between New York, New Orleans and Texas. One improvement that year was the installation of two steam powered Nutter car hoists in north Danville, Virginia in order to allow truck exchange to allow cars to be exchanged across the break of gauge with the Virginia Midland Railway.

In or about 1886, the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company acquired a majority of R&amp;D Company stock, and thus control of the railroad.

By 1890, the R&amp;D System covered of track in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. However, the R&amp;D System had become financially unstable during all the growth. After the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company, declared bankruptcy, the R&amp;D Company was pulled down with it. Receivers were appointed to take possession of its property, including its subsidiaries, on June 15, 1892.

===Southern Railway System (1894-1982)===
On June 18, 1894, the R&amp;D was sold in foreclosure. Its property was surrendered to Southern Railway Company for operation on July 1, 1894, even though the deeds of conveyance were not completed and filed until later. Reorganized by J.P. Morgan and his New York banking firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company, the R&amp;D was merged with five other railroads to form the new Southern Railway.

The R&amp;D property was formally conveyed to Southern Railway Company by deeds dated January 9, 1896, and August 30, 1897. The Southern Railway Company, incorporated in Virginia on the same date, June 18, 1894, controlled over of line at its inception. Samuel Spencer became Southern&#x27;s first president.

===Norfolk Southern (1982-present)===
Norfolk Southern Corporation, a holding corporation, acquired control of Norfolk and Western Railway Company and Southern Railway Company and their affiliates and subsidiaries on June 1, 1982, after approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Effective December 31, 1990, Southern Railway Company changed its name to Norfolk Southern Railway Company. Norfolk and Western Railway Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Railway Company rather than a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Corporation. In 1999, the system grew substantially with the acquisition of over half of Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).

<text>A sejmik (, diminutive of &quot;sejm&quot;, occasionally translated as a &quot;dietine&quot;; ) was one of various local parliaments in the history of Poland and history of Lithuania. The first sejmiks were regional assemblies in the Kingdom of Poland (before 1572), though they gained significantly more influence in the later era of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (18th century). Sejmiks arose around the late 14th and early 15th centuries and existed until the end of the Commonwealth in 1795, following the partitions of the Commonwealth. In a limited form, some sejmiks existed in partitioned Poland (1795–1918), and later in the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939). In modern Poland, since 1999, the term has revived with the &quot;voivodeship sejmiks&quot; (&quot;sejmiki województwa&quot;), referring to the elected councils of each of the 16 voivodeships.

The competencies of sejmiks varied over time, and there were also geographical differences. Often, numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure. Almost always presided over by the marshal, sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm, and sometimes would give such delegates binding instructions. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they effectively supplanted the inefficient national sejm.

==Etymology==
The words &quot;sejm&quot; and &quot;sejmik&quot; are cognates with the old Czech &quot;sejmovat&quot;, which means &quot;to bring together&quot; or &quot;to summon&quot;. Both forms originate from Proto-Slavic *sъjьmъ, from *sъ- (&quot;from, with&quot;) and *jęti (&quot;to take&quot;).

== History ==
The traditions of a sejmik can be traced to the institution of the wiec that actually predates the Polish state. They originated from gatherings of nobility, formed for military and consultative purposes. Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks, with some proposed dates being 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce) and 1454 (the Nieszawa Statutes). Geographically, sejmiks first arose in central Poland (Greater Poland province). Over the next century or so, they spread to other provinces of Poland, and finally, by the 16th century, to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, in a privilege granted to the szlachta (Polish nobility) by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, when the king agreed to consult with the nobility concerning certain decisions. Casimir&#x27;s recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the magnates, and counteract it with the middle nobility.

With the creation of a national Sejm in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished. Still, the sejmikis continued to play an important role in the governance of Poland as the most direct form of political enfranchisement of the nobility.

In the 1560s, the state organization of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was reformed in accordance with the Polish model. An act of July 1564 established sejmiks in the Grand Duchy.

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had about 70 sejmiks (out of those, 24 were in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Jacek Jędruch notes a trend of an increasing number of sejmiks over time, from about 16 in the 15th century to 104 by the late 18th century, as nobility sought to meet in places that required less travel time. Stanisław Płaza also estimates about 100 at the turn of the 18th century. Those sejmiks elected 170 deputies (48 from Lithuania). Most sejmiks elected 2 deputies, but there were exceptions. Wojciech Kriegseisen notes that until the late 18th century, there were 44 sejmiks in Poland proper (the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland), 24 in Lithuania, and 1 in Inflanty province.

The sejmik&#x27;s role grew again in the late 17th century, as central power weakened. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they often set their own time limits—that is, they extended their authorized periods of operation. In the face of an inefficient central government, with the national Sejm often disrupted by the liberum veto and the office of starosta losing much of its importance, sejmiks administered a portion of the taxes, and raised their own military (&quot;wojsko powiatowe&quot;). This period, which was known as the &quot;rule of sejmiks&quot; (&quot;rządy sejmikowe&quot;), was brought to an end by acts of the one-day Silent Sejm (Polish: &quot;sejm niemy&quot;) of 1717, which removed most taxation and military competences from the sejmiks. Some sejmiks were also affected by liberum veto until it was abolished for sejmiks in 1766; this was not always the case, as some decided to forgo unanimity and move to majority rule.

Where the middle nobility had been the leading force at the sejmiks in the 16th century, the magnates became increasingly influential in the 18th century. This stemmed from their ability to bribe masses of poorly educated, landless nobility (known as magnate&#x27;s &quot;clients&quot; or &quot;clientele&quot;), as all nobles were eligible to vote in the sejmiks. Sejmiks in Lithuania were dominated by the magnates to a greater extent than those in Poland proper, as the Lithuanian magnates were more powerful than their Polish counterparts. The magnate-dominated sejmiks, which gathered impoverished nobility, have been described as more concerned with eating and drinking than debate; for the poorest of nobility, they were a rare occasion to participate in feasts sponsored by the magnates. When they met, the drunken nobility was known to fight among themselves, which on occasion led to fatalities.

Sejmiks were significantly reformed by the &quot;Prawo o sejmikach&quot;, the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized as part of the Constitution of 3 May. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.

Although the independent existence of the Commonwealth ended with the partitions of Poland in 1795, the institution of the sejmik continued, albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion. In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition. In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag). Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian partition and Austrian partition, but they did not bear the name of sejmiks.

After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were restored in the Second Polish Republic, although they were called sejms rather than sejmiks. They included the short-lived Sejm of Central Lithuania (1921–1922); the three voivodeship sejms (Silesian Parliament, Greater Poland Sejm, and Pomeranian Sejm, 1920–1939), which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the county sejmiks, of which there were 264 in 1939. The existence of these institutions was interrupted by the occupation of Poland during the Second World War, and they were not reestablished in the era of communist Poland.

The sejmiks were revived again after the fall of communism in modern Poland. Since 1999, the term &quot;sejmik&quot; (in full, &quot;sejmik województwa&quot;) has been used to refer to the elected council of each of the 16 voivodeships or regions (see voivodeship sejmik). The word &quot;sejmik&quot; was chosen by lawmakers in order to eliminate the term &quot;rada wojewódzka&quot; (voivodeship council), which conjured memories of voivodeship people&#x27;s councils during the communist Poland era.

==Sejmiks of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==

=== Features ===
Sejmiks were usually held in a large, open field. The nobility would elect a presiding officer (&quot;marszałek sejmiku&quot;: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms. (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to the chairman of the voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal. Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.

It is estimated that most sejmiks drew around 4 to 6% of eligible participants.

===Types===

Historians distinguish several types of sejmiks, depending on their geographical scope:
* General (Polish: &quot;generalny&quot;, Latin &quot;conventiones generales&quot;), held in western Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in southern Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their goal was to agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.
* Provincial, Territorial, Voivodeship or County (Polish: &quot;ziemski&quot;, Latin &quot;conventiones particulares, conventiones terrestrae&quot;). The names of these sejmiks varied depending on their administrative level and local traditions; Płaza lists powiat sejmiks (county sejmiks; &quot;sejmiki powiatowe&quot;), ziemia sejmiks (territorial sejmiks; &quot;sejmiki ziemskie&quot;), voivodeship sejmiks (&quot;sejmiki wojewódzkie&quot;) and provincial sejmiks (&quot;sejmiki prowincjonalne&quot;). A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks, and moving upwards to ziemia, voivodeship, general (of several voivodeships) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final, national sejm. Almost all ziemias had their own sejmiks, but the importance of the sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous (that is, whether it was part of a voivodeship). Powiat sejms were common in Lithuania, but were rare in the Crown of Poland, where instead voivodeship sejms were much more common. Some voivodeships could hold a single voivodeship sejmik, and others might be covered by more than one sejmik. The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm. Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms. They rose in importance again in the second half of the 17th century, as the central Sejm grew weaker.

Kriegseisen, quoting Adam Lityński, argues that there was only one type of sejmik and that the only difference between various sejmiks was the purpose for which they were convened. Nonetheless, other scholars often distinguish between different types of sejmiks. Juliusz Bardach and Jędruch, for example, divide sejmiks based on their purpose as follows:
* Pre-sejm (Polish: &quot;przedsejmowe&quot;) sejmiks were convened by the king who sent a writ (&quot;legacja królewska&quot;) to each sejmik, outlining the reasons the next Sejm would be held. Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (&quot;poslowie&quot;), depending on the size and importance of the sejmik&#x27;s territory, to the &quot;ordinary&quot; General Sejm (Polish: &quot;Sejm Walny&quot;) that was held every two years, and to any &quot;extraordinary&quot; General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency. Sometimes pre-sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or even give the deputies full freedom. These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century.
* Relational or Debriefing (Polish: &quot;relacyjne&quot;) sejmiks heard the reports of deputies returned from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (&quot;konstytucje sejmowe&quot;) decreed by the Sejm. They passed specific instructions with regards to the execution of sejm decrees, and other local resolutions. Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.
* Electoral (Polish: &quot;elekcyjne&quot;) sejmiks elected higher voivodeship officials, judges in particular. They were convened irregularly, as such offices were usually held for life. Several candidates would be nominated, and the king would make the final appointment from among them. These sejmiks arose in the 15th century.
* Deputational or Judicial (Polish: &quot;deputackie&quot;) sejmiks met on a yearly basis and elected deputies (&quot;deputaci&quot;) to tribunals (Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal) from the times of King Stefan Batory onwards (starting in 1578 in Poland, and from 1581 in Lithuania).
* Administrative or Economic (Polish: &quot;gospodarcze&quot;) sejmiks oversaw voivodeship self-government. Often, they were held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as &quot;laudas&quot;. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century.
* Hooded (Polish: &quot;kapturowe&quot;) sejmiks had special powers during an interregnum. These sejmiks were organized as confederations, and would elect confederation officials. The name was derived from hoods worn in the period of royal mourning. These sejmiks began during the interregnum of 1572.

==Assessment and historiography==
Kriegseisen notes that the institution of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik&#x27;s decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.

Kriegseisen also remarks that there is a myth about the uniqueness of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (Silesia, Prussia, Brandenburg).

=== Duchy of Livonia ===
* According to the 1598 bill of the Sejm, regional sejmiks for Livonia took place in Kieś, in some cases also in Ryga. After Swedish conquest of most of Livonia in the 1620s, the sejmiks were moved to Dyneburg. The nobility of the County of Piltyń, formally equal to the nobility of the Commonwealth, did not elect any envoys to the Sejm.

<doc id="1248624" wikidata="Q6857659" url="?curid=1248624" title="Military history of the North-West Frontier">
<text>The [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|North-West Frontier]] (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was a region of the British Indian Empire. It remains the western frontier of present-day Pakistan, extending from the Pamir Knot in the north to the Koh-i-Malik Siah in the west, and separating the modern Pakistani frontier regions of North-West Frontier Province (renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan from neighbouring Afghanistan in the west. The borderline between is officially known as the Durand Line and divides Pashtun inhabitants of these provinces from Pashtuns in eastern Afghanistan.

The two main gateways on the North West Frontier are the Khyber and Bolan Passes. Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has been repeatedly invaded through these northwestern routes. With the expansion of the Russian Empire into Central Asia in the twentieth century, stability of the Frontier and control of Afghanistan became cornerstones of defensive strategy for British India.

Much of the Frontier was occupied by Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century, and then taken over by the East India Company when it annexed the Punjab in 1849.

Between 1849 and 1947 the military history of the frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending Pashtun (or &quot;Pathan&quot;) tribes, punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan. Many British officers who went on to distinguished command in the First and Second World Wars learnt their soldiering on the North-West Frontier, which they called the &quot;Grim&quot;.

==Contestants==

===Afghanistan===
In 1747 when Ahmad Khān Abdālī seized control of Kandahar, Kabul, and Peshawar, and, as Ahmad Shah Durrani, was proclaimed Shah of the Afghans. He went on to conquer Herat and Khorassan, and established an empire from the Oxus to the Indus. On his death in 1773, the Afghan domain included Baluchistan, Sindh, the Punjab, and Kashmir. Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son Timur Shah Durrani, whose rule of twenty years saw the Afghan tide begin to ebb. Timur left many sons but no heir, and the resultant internecine struggles for the throne lasted more than thirty years. During this period the Punjab was effectively ceded to its erstwhile governor Ranjit Singh, Iran recovered Khorassan, and Sindh broke away. In 1813 Sikh forces from the Punjab crossed the Indus and seized the old Mughal fort at Attock. In 1819 Kashmir was lost, and west of the Indus Derajat also. Four years later the winter capital at Peshawar came under attack.

In 1826 Dost Mohammad Khan emerged as undisputed ruler in Kabul, and was there proclaimed Emir. He defeated a further attempt to oust him by his exiled rival Shuja Shah Durrani in 1833; however the Sikhs seized all of Peshawar the following year. In 1837 Dost Mohammad launched a counter-attack through the Khyber, but the Afghan force was halted at Jamrud Fort. Dost Mohammad had sought assistance from the East India Company against the resurgent Punjab, but was rebuffed. So Dost Mohammad turned to Imperial Russia for help.


===Sikh Empire===
Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a Sikh ruler of the sovereign country of Punjab and the Sikh Empire. His Samadhi is located in Lahore, Pakistan.

He then spent the following years fighting the Afghans, driving them out of western Punjab, taking opportunity of the Afghans being embroiled in civil war. The deposed Afghan king Shah Shuja rallied a significant number of tribes and received British backing in the form of the Sikh army against the Barakzai king Dost Muhammad. The civil war in Afghanistan coupled with a British backed assault meant that the Sikhs could virtually walk into Peshawar. They managed to capture some Pashtun territory including Peshawar which was under direct British supervision and control.

===British East India Company===

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the East India Company controlled southern India, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa (modern Odisha). Dominance was gained at the expense of its successive French equivalents. Britain and France were at war, and the Franco-Persian alliance of 1807, followed the same year by the Franco-Russian Treaty of Tilsit, alerted the &quot;HEIC&quot; to the external threat posed from the north-west.

By 1819 only Sindh and the Sikh Empire remained outside the company&#x27;s control. Napoleon was vanquished, but the Empire of the Tsars had begun to expand south and east. Russian influence grew likewise, and by the early 1830s Qajar Irān was within the Tsar&#x27;s sphere. Attempts by Irān to recover Herat in 1834, and again in 1837, raised the spectre of Russian armies on the road to Kandahar, whence direct access to India through the Khojak and Bolan passes.

Meanwhile, the conflict between Afghanistan and the Punjab focused on the Khyber route. Dost Mohammad appealed to the HEIC for aid in recovering Peshawar, but the company could not help him without alienating its treaty ally Ranjit Singh. When Dost Mohammad redirected his appeal to Russia, the Governor-General Lord Auckland resolved to depose Dost Mohammad, and replace him with Shuja Shah Durrani. Restored to his throne in Kabul, the exiled former ruler would accept the Sikh gains west of the Indus, and the Company controlling his foreign policy. The agreement was formalised with the Treaty of Simla signed in June 1838 between Shah Shuja, the HEIC, and Ranjit Singh.

In the period following the annexation of the Punjab in 1849 until the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, several expeditions were undertaken against almost every tribe along the whole of the North-West Frontier, most notably under Sir Charles Napier and Sir Colin Campbell, under orders from the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie. Disgusted at being instructed to burn Pathan villages, first Napier and then Campbell resigned and returned to England. Campbell had already decided that the best method of dealing with the tribesmen on the frontier was through bribery.

When the Sepoy Rebellion broke out Amir Dost Mohammad Khan came under internal pressure to seize the advantage and attack India. However he stood by his treaty obligations. This allowed Indian troops on the frontier to deploy to Delhi and deal with the revolt centered there.

In 1877, Amir Sher Ali received a Russian mission in Kabul, but refused to accept one from the British. The following year Sher Ali signed a treaty with Russia. The British sent a mission anyway, but the mission and its armed escort were denied passage through the Khyber Pass. The British threatened to invade, and when no apology was forthcoming, did so. Sher Ali died while fleeing to Russian territory, and his son Yakub succeeded him. On May 26, 1879, Amir Yakub signed the Treaty of Gandamak, whereby Afghanistan surrendered its foreign policy to the British Empire, which in turn promised protection from aggression. Afghanistan ceded some territory and accepted a British Resident in Kabul until 1894.

In September 1879, some six weeks after establishing his residency, Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort were murdered. Hostilities promptly resumed. Yakub&#x27;s army was defeated in September 1880, and his throne was offered to, and accepted by, Abdur Rahman, who agreed to surrender all claims on the Khyber, the Kurram, Sibi, and Pishin.

=== 1914–1918 (First World War) ===

In support of the British war effort, the Indian Army deployed expeditionary forces to the Western Front, East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, Sinai and Palestine. India was thus vulnerable to hostile attention from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915 with obvious strategic purpose. However, Amir Habibulla abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan&#x27;s neutrality, in the face of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Hostilities on the frontier remained local.

* Kalat Operations (1915–16)
* Mohmand Blockade (1916–17)
* Operations against the Mahsuds (1917)
* Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918)

===1919–39 (between the wars)===

Having upheld Afghan neutrality while India was engaged in the Great War, Habibulla sought full independence for Afghanistan in February 1919. Such a reward might have consolidated his rule, but later that month he was murdered.

His successor Amanullah pursued a similar policy by different means. With India&#x27;s Army de-mobilising, and its Government preoccupied with violent unrest in western India, Amanullah sent his troops across the Frontier in early May. At the end of the month he sought an armistice, which was granted on 3 June. By the Treaty of Rawalpindi signed in August, Afghanistan gained control of its foreign affairs, and in turn, recognised the Durand Line as its border with India.

The short-lived war had long-term consequences in Waziristan, where tribesmen rallied to Amanullah&#x27;s cause. The western militia posts were abandoned. Many of the militia deserted, taking their modern weapons and joining their fellow tribesmen in attacking the remaining posts. As a result, the Indian Army&#x27;s &quot;Waziristan Force&quot; was fully engaged in re-establishing the posts and restoring the lines of communication from November until May 1920. The western base at Wana was finally reoccupied in December 1920.

The long-term plan for control of the district entailed building metalled roads along the lines of communication to a new central base to be established at Razmak. In 1921 work began on the southern road up the Tank Zam from Jandola, under the protection of the Waziristan Force. The following year work on the northern road from the Tochi began at Idak, shielded by the &quot;Razmak Force&quot; advancing to its objective. The two roads met in 1924, linking North and South Waziristan, and enabling the Indian Army to reorganise both areas as one military district. The Waziristan and Razmak Field Forces then devolved into brigades based permanently at Manzai, Razmak, Gardai, and Bannu.

The following year the few tribal sections in South Waziristan remaining openly hostile were subdued by aircraft alone. For this operation the No. 2 (Indian) Wing of the RAF under Wing Commander Richard Pink was based at Tank and Miranshah. Aircraft comprising the &quot;Wana Patrol&quot; maintained regular weekly contact with the posts at Wana and Tanai until 1929, when the road from Sarwekai was completed, and the Manzai brigade relocated to Wana.

===1940–1947 (Second World War to independence)===

From 1940 to 1947, Waziristan and indeed most of the Frontier remained relatively calm and the British were able to divert most of their military effort to more important theatres. There were, however, brief periods of trouble on the frontier, which required the British to continue to maintain a military presence in the region, although for the main they were able to employ mainly garrison or rear-area troops during this time, thus allowing them to free up front-line units for active service elsewhere.

Trained regular troops were desperately needed for the war against Germany and Japan.

Razmak, Wana and Bannu were garrisoned with half-trained units which suffered serious reverses, losing men, rifles, and light machine-guns.
In 1944, a British committee under Lieutenant-General Sir Francis Tuker was set up to review future policy for the region. As part of its findings, it recommended a return to the Curzon Plan, which advocated the withdrawal of all regular forces from tribal territory into outposts, or cantonments, along the administrative border from where they could keep an eye on things. The unadministered districts would then once again become the responsibility of the local militias.

===Withdrawal===

In 1947, following the independence, the North-West Frontier region became a part of the newly formed nation of Dominion of Pakistan. Based upon the recommendations of the Tucker committee in 1944 (see above), the newly formed Pakistani government decided to move away from the previous British policy of &#x27;forward defence&#x27; in the North-West Frontier region and ordered the withdrawal of forces from Waziristan, as it was felt that the presence of a regular military force in the region was provoking tensions with the local tribesmen. This withdrawal began on December 6, 1947 and was successfully completed by the end of the month under the codename Operation Curzon.

==Treatment of prisoners-of-war==
According to the British officer John Masters, Pashtun women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955) of British India during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would brutally castrate non-Muslim soldiers who were captured, especially British and Sikhs. Pashtun women urinated into prisoners&#x27; mouths. A method of execution by this is recorded: captured British soldiers were spread out and fastened with restraints to the ground, then a stick, or a piece of wood was used to keep their mouth open to prevent swallowing. Pashtun women then squatted and urinated directly into the mouth of the man until he drowned in the urine, taking turns one at a time. This method of execution was reported to have been practiced specifically by the women of the Afridi tribe of the Pashtuns.

==Military formations==

===Corps of Guides===
Corps of cavalry and infantry, raised at Peshawar in 1846 by Lt. Harry Lumsden, and later based at Hoti Mardan. Originally one troop of cavalry and two companies of infantry, the cavalry component later expanded to 2½ squadrons, and the infantry to 4½ companies. Two further infantry battalions were raised in 1917.

From its inception the corps was clothed in native style, with smock, baggy trousers and turban of home-spun cotton, and jerkin of sheepskin. The cotton was dyed grey with a derivative of a dwarf palm known as &quot;mazari&quot;, while the leather was dyed khaki with mulberry juice. Thus was military dress first coloured khaki for its camouflage effect, and the Guides were the first troops to wear it. The drab colour is well suited to the barren rocky terrain of the North-West Frontier, and all but one of the other Punjab frontier units soon followed the Guides example.

In 1848 the Second Sikh War broke out and the corps won its first battle honours; &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;G&#x27;, and &#x27;P&#x27;. Thereafter the Guides were engaged in most frontier affairs, and from 1857 the corps was included in the Punjab Irregular Force, and subsequently in the Punjab Frontier Force.

That same year the Corps of Guides was ordered to Delhi, covering the 930 km from Mardan in twenty-two days and famously going into action on arrival. They were duly honoured with D 1857.

At the beginning of the Second Afghan War in 1878, the Guides Infantry, together with the 1st Sikh Infantry, PFF, took part in forcing the Khyber, and were prominent in seizing the fortress of Ali Masjid. For this and subsequent efforts the Corps of Guides was awarded the battle honours A M, K 1879, and A 1878–80.

The last decade of the 19th century saw the Guides employed in the Chitral campaign of 1895, and the Punjab Frontier Revolt of 1897–8. Thus was the corps awarded the battle honours &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;, and &#x27;P F&#x27;.

The reforms of 1903 gave to the Queen&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden&#x27;s) a subsidiary title in the form of its founders name, but left it numberless. In 1911 the corps took up Frontier Force as its first subsidiary title.

During the First World War the cavalry branch of the Corps was deployed overseas to Mesopotamia, but not before winning a further honour in its own territory; &#x27;N.W. F I 1915&#x27;.

In 1922 the separation became permanent, when the mounted branch was redesignated the 10th Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force), and the infantry was amalgamated as the 5th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment (Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides).

===Sind Frontier Force===
Formed in 1846 to guard the southern part of the North-West Frontier. Initially consisting of just the Scinde Irregular Horse, the force under Capt. John Jacob was part of the Bombay Army.

====Cavalry====
The Scinde Irregular Horse was raised at Hyderabad in 1839 by Capt. Ward.

The regiment earned its first battle honour during the Operations in Scinde 1839-42, when it was awarded the unique distinction &#x27;C&#x27;.
For the subsequent Scinde Campaign of 1843 it was awarded &#x27;M&#x27; and &#x27;H&#x27;.

A second regiment was raised at Hyderabad in 1846 by Capt. J. Jacob.

During the Second Sikh War both the 1st and 2nd Irregular Horse earned further distinction with &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;G&#x27;, and &#x27;P&#x27;.

A third regiment was raised in 1857, and in 1860 the regiments were designated simply Scinde Horse.

The 1st Scinde Horse was deployed to suppress the Sepoy Revolt of 1857–8, and was duly awarded C I.

All three regiments were rewarded for their part in the Second Afghan War:-
* 1st Scinde Horse; A 1878-79
* 2nd Scinde Horse; A 1879-80
* 3rd Scinde Horse; K 1880, A 1878-80

Its hard-won honours notwithstanding, the third regiment was disbanded in 1882.

The 1st and 2nd Regiments joined the Bombay line in 1885 as the 5th and 6th Bombay Cavalry respectively.

In the reformed Indian Army in 1903 they were likewise redesignated 35th Scinde Horse and 36th Jacob&#x27;s Horse.

====Infantry====
Jacob&#x27;s Rifles, raised in 1858 by Maj. John Jacob.

In 1861 the rifles joined the Bombay line as the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry.

The regiment was honoured for its part in the Second Afghan War with A 1878-80

Designated 130th Baluchis in 1903, the subsidiary title was restored in 1910.

====Artillery====
The force was augmented with No. 2 Coy. Bombay Native Artillery in 1875, when that company relieved the men of Jacob&#x27;s Rfles manning the guns of the force headquarters at Jacobabad.

Converted to a mountain battery the following year, the company was accordingly redesignated No. 2 Bombay Mountain Battery.

For its part in the Second Afghan War the battery was awarded the honour A 1878-80

Later re-numbered as No. 6 (Bombay) Mountain Battery, and then briefly renamed the Jullundur Mountain Battery, the unit took its place in the reformed Indian Army of 1903 as 26th Jacob&#x27;s Mountain Battery.

===Frontier Brigade===
Created in 1846 to police the newly acquired Punjab border against the Pakhtun hill tribes.

The brigade was formed by Lt. Col. Henry Montgomery Lawrence from four regiments of infantry raised in 1846 from veterans of the Sikh forces disbanded after the First Anglo-Sikh War:-
* 1st Regiment, raised at Hoshiarpur by Capt. J. S. Hodson.
* 2nd Regiment, raised at Kangra by Capt. J. W. V. Stephen.
* 3rd Regiment, raised at Firozpur by Capt. F. Winter.
* 4th Regiment, raised at Ludhiana by Capt. C. Mackenzie.
The brigades &quot;Frontier&quot; designation was discontinued in 1847, and the four regiments became Sikh Local Infantry.

For their part in the Second Sikh War the 1st and 2nd (or Hill) regiments were awarded the battle honour &#x27;P&#x27;.

===Transfrontier Brigade===
Formed by Col. Henry Lawrence in 1849.

====Cavalry====
Five cavalry regiments were raised in 1849 and designated Punjab Cavalry:-
* 1st Regiment, raised at Peshawar by Lt. H. Daly.
* 2nd Regiment, raised at Lahore by Lt. S. J. Browne.
* 3rd Regiment, raised at Lahore by Lt. W. G. Prendergast.
* 4th Regiment
* 5th Regiment, raised at Multan by Capt. R. Fitzgerald.

====Infantry====
Five infantry regiments were raised in 1849 from Sikh Darbar regiments disbanded after the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and designated Punjab Infantry:-
* 1st Regiment, raised at Peshawar by Capt. John Coke.
* 2nd Regiment, raised at Mianwali by Lt. L. C. Johnston.
* 3rd Regiment
* 4th Regiment, raised at Lahore by Capt. George Gladwin Denniss II.
* 5th Regiment, raised at Leiah by Capt. James Eardley Gastrell.
* 6th Regiment, originally raised at Karachi in 1843 as the Scinde Camel Corps, and redesignated &quot;Punjab Infantry&quot; in 1853.

Formed in 1851 by combining the Corps of Guides, the four regiments of Sikh Local Infantry, the Transfrontier Brigade, and five batteries of artillery. The units of the force came to be known collectively from its initials as Piffers.

====Cavalry====

The Punjab Cavalry regiments were redesignated Cavalry, Punjab Irregular Force.

While the 3rd and 4th regiments remained on the frontier, the 1st, 2nd, and 5th were employed in suppressing the Sepoy Revolt, and later rewarded with the battle honours D 1857, and L.

====Artillery====
Batteries were raised from various sources:-
* No. 1 Horse Light Field Battery, PIF
* No. 2 Horse Light Field Battery, PIF, raised at Bannu in 1851 by Lt. H. Hammond, from detachments of horse artillery formerly in the service of the Lahore Darbar.
* No. 3 Horse Light Field Battery, PIF, raised at Dera Ghazi Khan in 1849 by Lt. D. McNeill, from a disbanded troop of horse artillery formerly in the service of the Lahore Darbar.
* No. 4 or Garrison Company, PIF, raised at Bannu in 1851 by Lt. S. W. Stokes, from the of a Sikh detachment of artillery which had been broken up and drafted into the horse light field batteries.
The Horse Light Field Batteries were generally known as Punjab Light Field Batteries.

Later the force gained two further batteries:-
* Hazara Mountain Train Battery, PIF, in 1856. (Formed at Haripur in 1851, by Lt. G. G. Pearse.)
* Peshawar Mountain Train Battery, PIF, in 1862. (Formed at Peshawar in 1853 by Capt. T. Brougham.)

====Infantry====
In 1857 the four regiments of Sikh Local Infantry became Sikh Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force.

The six Punjab Infantry regiments were simply redesignated Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force.

The 4th Regiment of Sikh Infantry served in the Second Burma War, winning the honour P, and then marched 900 km from Abbottabad in thirty days to help suppress the revolt in Delhi, and like the Guides going into action on arrival. There it won also D 1857. The other Sikh Infantry regiments remained in the Punjab.

Leaving the 3rd, 5th, &amp; 6th Punjab Infantry Regiments to guard the frontier, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th were sent to put down the revolt in Delhi. There they earned the honour D 1857. The 2nd and 4th regiments were also rewarded with L.

From 1861 the force included a 7th Infantry Regiment, formed from the Hazara Gurkha Battalion, which later that year joined the &quot;Gurkha Line&quot; as the 5th Gurkha Regiment.

===Punjab Frontier Force===

In 1865 the &quot;Punjab Irregular Force&quot; was renamed the &quot;Punjab Frontier Force&quot;, and the constituent units were redesignated accordingly.

During peacetime the Force was under the direct control of the Lt.-Governor of the Punjab, but in war it came under the Commander-in-Chief, India.

After the three Presidency armies, it was the most important military force at the Governor-General&#x27;s disposal. Deployed and engaged in numerous border expeditions, it became the most experienced body of fighting troops in India.
Most of the force saw action during the Second Afghan War. The designation &quot;Punjab Frontier Force&quot; was dropped in 1901, but with the Kitchener Reforms of the British Indian Army two years later, the former distinction was restored to the newly re-numbered regiments in the form of the subsidiary title Frontier Force.

====Cavalry====
Officially designated Cavalry, Punjab Frontier Force, the earlier style endured, and was restored in 1901.

Four of the regiments were honoured for service in the Second Afghan War:-
* 1st Punjab Cavalry; A K, A 1878-80
* 2nd Punjab Cavalry; A K, A 1878-80
* 3rd Punjab Cavalry; K 1880, A 1879-80
* 5th Punjab Cavalry; C, K 1879, A 1878-80

The 4th regiment served on the frontier before being disbanded in 1882.

In 1903 the four remaining regiments were brought into the new Indian Army line by adding twenty to their original numbers:-
* 21st Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) (Daly&#x27;s Horse)
* 22nd Sam Browne&#x27;s Cavalry (Frontier Force)
* 23rd Cavalry (Frontier Force)
* 25th Cavalry (Frontier Force)

====Artillery====

The two mountain trains were redesignated mountain batteries in 1865.

In 1876 the three Punjab Light Field Batteries were reduced to form two further mountain batteries, and the four were then renumbered according to their relative precedence, and designated Punjab Mountain Batteries, Punjab Frontier Force.

The former Garrison Company was also renumbered in the same sequence to become the No. 5 Garrison Battery, Punjab Frontier Force.

All four mountain batteries were honoured for their part in the Second Afghan War:-
* No. 1 (Kohat) Punjab Mountain Battery; P K, K 1879, A 1878-80
* No. 2 (Derajat) Punjab Mountain Battery; C, K 1879, K 1880, A 1878-80
* No. 3 (Peshawar) Punjab Mountain Battery; A 1878-79
* No. 4 (Hazara) Punjab Mountain Battery; A M, K 1879, A 1879-80

In 1895 the Derajat and Hazara Mountain Batteries were part of the relief expedition that was rewarded with the honour C.

The Frontier Revolt of 1897-8 saw the Kohat and Derajat batteries in action again, earning the honours T and P F.

In 1901 the battery numbers were dropped, and they became known by name only. Two years later the four mountain batteries were re-numbered from twenty-one, and the former &quot;Piffer&quot; batteries were thus:-
* 21st Kohat Mountain Battery (Frontier Force)
* 22nd Derajat Mountain Battery (Frontier Force)
* 23rd Peshawar Mountain Battery (Frontier Force)
* 24th Hazara Mountain Battery (Frontier Force)
* The Frontier Garrison Artillery

====Infantry====

The four Sikh regiments were simply redesignated Sikh Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force.

The six former Punjab Infantry regiments were officially redesignated Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force, but the earlier style lingered and was restored in 1901.

Although never designated as such, the 5th Gurkha Regiment was brigaded with the force in practice.

All but two of the infantry regiments took the field in the Second Afghan War, and their subsequent awards were:-
* 1st Sikh Infantry; A M, A 1878-80
* 2nd Sikh Infantry; A K, K 1880, A 1878-80
* 3rd Sikh Infantry; K 1879, K 1880, A 1879-80
* 1st Punjab Infantry; A 1878-79
* 2nd Punjab Infantry; P K, A 1878-79
* 4th Punjab Infantry; A 1879-80
* 5th Punjab Infantry; P K, C, K 1879, A 1878-80
* 5th Gurkha Regiment; P K, C, K 1879, A 1878-80

Spending cuts after the war resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Punjab Infantry in 1882.

Spared the same fate, the 4th Sikh Infantry was employed in the expedition of 1895 earning the honour C.

The Frontier Revolt of 1897-8 saw the 3rd Sikh and 2nd Punjab Infantries employed in the Tirah Campaign, earning them the honors T and P F. The 5th Gurkha Rifles was also awarded P F.

In 1903 the four Sikh Infantry regiments were brought into the new Indian Army Line by adding fifty to their original numbers:-
* 51st Sikhs (Frontier Force)
* 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force)
* 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force)
* 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)

The five remaining regiments of Punjab Infantry were consecutively renumbered in the same sequence to become:-
* 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force)
* 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force)
* 57th Wilde&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force)
* 58th Vaughan&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force)
* 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)

The 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force) took on the subsidiary title denoting their origin.

=== Frontier Constabulary ===

===Frontier Corps===

Although the units of the Frontier Corps operated under a variety of titles, from Rifles to Militia to Scouts, it was the latter term that came to stand as the generic term, and as new units were formed, it was the word &#x27;Scouts&#x27; that became fixed and formalised for the regimental titles. The expression &#x27;Scouts&#x27; was a militarily neutral term, conveying neither the &quot;crack&quot; reputation associated with the word &#x27;Rifles&#x27; (cf.: 60th Rifles [HM], Gurkha Rifles [IA], etc.), nor the rather second-rate expectations of the term &#x27;Militia&#x27;. As General Baden-Powell noted, when he was looking, many years later, for a suitably inspiring term to adopt for his youth movement to train young boys in fieldcraft and other &#x27;para-military&#x27; activities, the word Scouts encapsulated a spirit of &#x27;dash&#x27; (enthusiasm), expertise - within a defined set of skills- and familiarity with both the local conditions. Similarly, the Scouts of the Frontier Corps understood both the local terrain and the local political minefields, that is, who could be trusted (e.g. the Turi), and who could never (almost invariably, this would mean the Mahsuds); who was currently nursing a grievance and therefore best avoided, and who had just had a claim settled to their satisfaction and might be uncharacteristically friendly.

Like many things British, the development of the units of Scouts into the Frontier Corps was organic, unplanned and initially unsystematic. It began, in the British manner, as an improvisation to meet a need; it was maintained because it guaranteed certain unique skills at an acceptable price (the great Empire may have vaunted its &#x27;pomp and circumstance&#x27; to wow the impressionable, but behind the scenes the deciding factor was often simply the acceptability or otherwise to HM Treasury) and only then was the principle regularised, standardised and systemised (cf. the development of the Frontier Force, from irregulars to a corps d&#x27;elite).

<doc id="1248639" wikidata="Q2388774" url="?curid=1248639" title="Gray's Anatomy (film)">
<text>Gray&#x27;s Anatomy is an 80-minute concert film directed by Steven Soderbergh in 1996 involving a dramatized monologue by actor/writer Spalding Gray. The title is taken from the classic human anatomy textbook &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, originally written by Henry Gray in 1858. It was shot in ten days in late January 1996 during a break Soderbergh had from post-production on his previous film, &quot;Schizopolis&quot;.

The monologist film is about Spalding Gray, the main character, who is diagnosed with a rare ocular condition called macular pucker. After hearing all of his options, such as Christian Science, Native American sweat lodges, and the &quot;Elvis Presley of psychic surgeons&quot;, and the dangers of what surgery could bring, he decides to go through the other forms of medicine provided. This in turn takes him on a journey around the world and steers him away from surgery more so because of religious reasons, often in a dramatic and humorous fashion.

This was the fourth and last of Gray&#x27;s theatrically released monologue films, following &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;, &quot;Monster in a Box&quot;, and &quot;Terrors of Pleasure&quot;.

The film is available on DVD. A remastered version was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2012.

==Cast==
Spalding Gray was raised in Rhode Island and attended school in Massachusetts. Gray&#x27;s style as an actor was influenced by Allen Ginsberg, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliot, and the American Autobiographical movement. He mostly worked in experimental theater. In 1977, he co-founded the Wooster Theater Group in New York City. Two years later he performed his first monologue: &quot;Sex and Death at the Age of 14&quot;. In the &#x27;80s Gray traveled to Thailand where he won two Independent Spirit Awards for the film &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;. He appeared in several independent films in the &#x27;90s before &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; was published.

==Critical reception==
Janet Maslin of the New York Times gave a positive review, calling it &quot;A chatty, colorful, nicely sardonic account of how a crisis led Mr. Gray to assess his medical state, consider his mortality and take one more funny, self-dramatizing look at the eccentric world around him.&quot;

Desson Thomson of the Washington Post also reviewed the film positively, stating &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy finds Spalding Gray turning a bout with a bizarre ocular condition into a dizzying, absorbing odyssey of the neurotic mind.&quot;

The Digital Fix described &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as &quot;very witty and a pleasure to listen to. As he passes fifty, Gray starts to worry about his own death before he finds the sight in his left eye is becoming distorted. Learning that he has a macular pucker, Gray seeks out alternative therapies, including mass nude encounters in a sweatbox, a raw-vegetable diet and a trip to the Philippines to meet a psychic surgeon.&quot;

On the other hand, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as an unremarkable story. &quot;There&#x27;s something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. This creeping sense that Gray isn&#x27;t really interested in anything he&#x27;s talking about – that he, alone, is the subject of his own obsession gives &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; a distasteful edge.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as &quot;demonstrating that fully stimulating the senses isn&#x27;t the same as fully engaging them. The film begins as ordinary as could be and then continues with scenery changes, lighting effects, and moody music.&quot;

<text>Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova (29 November 1937 – 21 December 2023) was the head of the Salvadoran national guard between the years 1979 and 1983 and later served as the nation&#x27;s Minister of Defense between 1983 and 1989.

In 1984, four national guardsmen who had once served under Vides Casanova&#x27;s command – Daniel Canales Ramírez, Carlos Joaquín Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos and José Roberto Moreno Canjura – were convicted of murdering four American nuns and were sentenced to 30 years in prison. Their superior, sub-sergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Alemán, was also convicted of the murders.

In 1998, the four murderers confessed to abducting, raping and murdering the four nuns and claimed that they did so because Alemán had informed them that they had to act on orders from high-level military officers. Some were then released from prison after detailing how Vides and his cousin Col. Óscar Edgardo Casanova Vejar, the local military commander in Zacatecoluca, had planned and orchestrated the executions of the nuns. A 16-year legal battle to deport General Vides Casanova soon commenced.

==Emigration to the United States==
Following his retirement, General Vides left El Salvador and moved to Florida in 1989 as a legal permanent resident and lived in Palm Coast.

After his first wife died, Vides married Lourdes Llach, daughter of coffee baron, amateur astronomer, and former Salvadoran ambassador to the Holy See (1977–1991) Prudencio Llach Schonenberg.

===Lawsuit cases===
Vides Casanova was sued in the federal civil court of Miami, Florida in the United States in two precedent-setting cases. The cases are referred to by the surname of his co-defendant, José Guillermo García:
* &quot;Ford v. Garcia&quot;, a lawsuit by the families of four Catholic nuns who were abducted, raped and murdered by a Salvadoran military death squad on 2 December 1980. The defense won the case, and the families appealed. Their appeal was denied, and in 2003, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear further proceedings.
* &quot;Ramagoza v. Garcia&quot;, a lawsuit by survivors of torture during the Salvadoran Civil War, including Carlos Mauricio and Neris González. Garcia and Vides lost, and a judgment of over $54 million (U.S.) was entered against them, and upheld on appeal.

===Deportation to El Salvador===
On 6 October 2009 the United States Department of Homeland Security announced that it had initiated deportation proceedings against General Vides Casanova for assisting in the torture of Salvadoran civilians. On 24 February 2012, a Federal immigration judge cleared the way for his deportation.

On 11 March 2015, the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed General Vides Casanova&#x27;s appeal.
On 8 April 2015, U.S. immigration officials deported General Vides Casanova to El Salvador.
The lawsuit filed against Vides Casanova and General García was featured in the 2018 film &quot;The Path of the Shadows&quot;.

==Death==
Vides Casanova died in San Salvador on 21 December 2023, at the age of 86.

<doc id="1248647" wikidata="Q1959911" url="?curid=1248647" title="Relative homology">
<text>In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the (singular) homology of a topological space relative to a subspace is a construction in singular homology, for pairs of spaces. The relative homology is useful and important in several ways. Intuitively, it helps determine what part of an absolute homology group comes from which subspace.

== Definition ==
Given a subspace formula_1, one may form the short exact sequence

:formula_2

where formula_3 denotes the singular chains on the space &quot;X&quot;. The boundary map on formula_3 descends to formula_5 and therefore induces a boundary map formula_6 on the quotient. If we denote this quotient by formula_7, we then have a complex
:formula_8

By definition, the th relative homology group of the pair of spaces formula_9 is

:formula_10

One says that relative homology is given by the relative cycles, chains whose boundaries are chains on &quot;A&quot;, modulo the relative boundaries (chains that are homologous to a chain on &quot;A&quot;, i.e., chains that would be boundaries, modulo &quot;A&quot; again).

==Properties==

The above short exact sequences specifying the relative chain groups give rise to a chain complex of short exact sequences. An application of the snake lemma then yields a long exact sequence

:formula_11

The connecting map &quot;formula_12&quot; takes a relative cycle, representing a homology class in formula_13, to its boundary (which is a cycle in &quot;A&quot;).

It follows that formula_14, where formula_15 is a point in &quot;X&quot;, is the &quot;n&quot;-th reduced homology group of &quot;X&quot;. In other words, formula_16 for all formula_17. When formula_18, formula_19 is the free module of one rank less than formula_20. The connected component containing formula_15 becomes trivial in relative homology.

The excision theorem says that removing a sufficiently nice subset formula_22 leaves the relative homology groups formula_13 unchanged. If formula_24 has a neighbourhood formula_25 in formula_26 that deformation retracts to formula_24, then using the long exact sequence of pairs and the excision theorem, one can show that formula_13 is the same as the &quot;n&quot;-th reduced homology groups of the quotient space formula_29.

Relative homology readily extends to the triple formula_30 for formula_31.

One can define the Euler characteristic for a pair formula_32 by

:formula_33

The exactness of the sequence implies that the Euler characteristic is &quot;additive&quot;, i.e., if formula_31, one has

:formula_35

== Local homology ==
The formula_36-th local homology group of a space formula_26 at a point formula_15, denoted
:formula_39
is defined to be the relative homology group formula_40. Informally, this is the &quot;local&quot; homology of formula_26 close to formula_15.

=== Local homology of the cone CX at the origin ===
One easy example of local homology is calculating the local homology of the cone (topology) of a space at the origin of the cone. Recall that the cone is defined as the quotient space
:formula_43
where formula_44 has the subspace topology. Then, the origin formula_45 is the equivalence class of points formula_46. Using the intuition that the local homology group formula_47 of formula_48 at formula_15 captures the homology of formula_48 &quot;near&quot; the origin, we should expect this is the homology of formula_51 since formula_52 has a homotopy retract to formula_26. Computing the local homology can then be done using the long exact sequence in homology
:formula_54
Because the cone of a space is contractible, the middle homology groups are all zero, giving the isomorphism
:formula_55
since formula_52 is contractible to formula_26.

==== In algebraic geometry ====
Note the previous construction can be proven in algebraic geometry using the affine cone of a projective variety formula_26 using Local cohomology.

=== Local homology of a point on a smooth manifold ===
Another computation for local homology can be computed on a point formula_59 of a manifold formula_60. Then, let formula_61 be a compact neighborhood of formula_59 isomorphic to a closed disk formula_63 and let formula_64. Using the excision theorem there is an isomorphism of relative homology groups
:formula_65
hence the local homology of a point reduces to the local homology of a point in a closed ball formula_66. Because of the homotopy equivalence
:formula_67
and the fact
:formula_68
the only non-trivial part of the long exact sequence of the pair formula_69 is
:formula_70
hence the only non-zero local homology group is formula_71.

==Functoriality==
Just as in absolute homology, continuous maps between spaces induce homomorphisms between relative homology groups. In fact, this map is exactly the induced map on homology groups, but it descends to the quotient.

Let formula_9 and formula_73 be pairs of spaces such that formula_1 and formula_75, and let formula_76 be a continuous map. Then there is an induced map formula_77 on the (absolute) chain groups. If formula_78, then formula_79. Let

formula_80

be the natural projections which take elements to their equivalence classes in the quotient groups. Then the map formula_81 is a group homomorphism. Since formula_82, this map descends to the quotient, inducing a well-defined map formula_83 such that the following diagram commutes:

Chain maps induce homomorphisms between homology groups, so formula_84 induces a map formula_85 on the relative homology groups.

==Examples==
One important use of relative homology is the computation of the homology groups of quotient spaces formula_29. In the case that formula_24 is a subspace of formula_26 fulfilling the mild regularity condition that there exists a neighborhood of formula_24 that has formula_24 as a deformation retract, then the group formula_91 is isomorphic to formula_92. We can immediately use this fact to compute the homology of a sphere. We can realize formula_93 as the quotient of an n-disk by its boundary, i.e. formula_94. Applying the exact sequence of relative homology gives the following:&lt;br&gt; formula_95

Because the disk is contractible, we know its reduced homology groups vanish in all dimensions, so the above sequence collapses to the short exact sequence:

formula_96

Therefore, we get isomorphisms formula_97. We can now proceed by induction to show that formula_98. Now because formula_99 is the deformation retract of a suitable neighborhood of itself in formula_100, we get that formula_101.

Another insightful geometric example is given by the relative homology of formula_102 where formula_103. Then we can use the long exact sequence
:formula_104
Using exactness of the sequence we can see that formula_105 contains a loop formula_106 counterclockwise around the origin. Since the cokernel of formula_107 fits into the exact sequence
:formula_108
it must be isomorphic to formula_109. One generator for the cokernel is the formula_110-chain formula_111 since its boundary map is
:formula_112

<text>AirUK was a regional airline in the United Kingdom formed in 1980 as a result of a merger involving four rival UK-based regional airlines. British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings owned British Island Airways (BIA) and Air Anglia were the two dominant merger partners.

The merged entity&#x27;s corporate headquarters were originally located at Redhill, the location of the old BIA head office. It subsequently relocated to Crawley. In addition to the main maintenance base at Norwich Airport (Air Anglia&#x27;s former engineering base), there also used to be a second major maintenance base at Blackpool Airport (the old BIA engineering base). This was closed down following Air UK&#x27;s major retrenchment during the early 1980s recession.

In 1987, Air UK established Air UK Leisure as a charter subsidiary. The following year, Air UK shifted its headquarters to Stansted Airport. When Stansted&#x27;s new Foster + Partners designed terminal opened in 1991, the airline became its first and subsequently main tenant.

Air UK was a full member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for most of its existence.

Air UK originally was a wholly owned subsidiary of British Air Transport Holdings, a successor to the Air Holdings Group owned 90% by B&amp;C and 10% by Eagle Star Insurance. This made the Cayzer family, who owned B&amp;C, the controlling shareholders.

Following the beginning of the gradual liberalisation of the European Union (EU) internal air transport market in 1987, Dutch flag carrier KLM, a long-standing business partner of Air UK and its predecessor Air Anglia, acquired a 14.9% minority stake in Air UK&#x27;s holding company. In 1995, KLM increased its minority stake in Air UK to 45%. In 1997, KLM became Air UK&#x27;s sole shareholder when it acquired B&amp;C&#x27;s stake in British Air Transport (Holdings). The following year Air UK was renamed KLM UK.

===Third Force===
Air UK was the name of the new airline resulting from the merger of BIA and Air Anglia. (BIA had already absorbed Exeter based Air Westward in March 1979). Cardiff-based Air Wales had become part of Air Anglia in June of that year.) It was incorporated on 1 January 1980. Operations commenced on 16 January 1980. At the time of its inception, Air UK was the largest regional airline in the UK and the country&#x27;s third-largest scheduled carrier. It had a staff of 1,700, carried more than 1m, mainly scheduled, passengers annually and had a fleet of 40 aircraft, consisting of six jets (four ex-BIA BAC One-Eleven 400s and two ex-Air Anglia F-28 4000 series Fellowships) and 34 turboprops (including eighteen ex-BIA Handley Page Dart Heralds, ten ex-Air Anglia Fokker F27 100/200 series Friendships and six Embraer 110 Bandeirantes originally part of the BIA, Air Wales and Air Westward fleets). Apart from the four One-Eleven 400s, which were predominantly operated on charter flights, all the other aircraft were part of Air UK&#x27;s scheduled service fleet.

For marketing purposes, there was no gap between the letters &quot;U&quot; and &quot;K&quot; in the &quot;Air UK&quot; logo in the newly merged entity&#x27;s first livery, which was a stylised Union Flag.

Former BIA managing director Peter Villa became Air UK&#x27;s first MD as well.

At the time of its creation, Air UK was sometimes referred to as the unofficial &quot;Third Force&quot; among the main contemporary scheduled airlines in the UK (British Caledonian (BCal) being the UK&#x27;s official &quot;Second Force&quot; and British Airways (BA) the primary UK flag carrier at that time).

Following the merger, most of the fleet progressively adopted Air UK&#x27;s new blue, white and red colour scheme. Originally, this featured a predominantly blue fuselage with a white-red-white strip across the windows and a white roof. The tail was also predominantly blue, apart from the &quot;Air UK&quot; logo. However, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) disapproved of this predominantly blue livery, arguing that it could potentially pose a safety hazard for other aircraft as it was difficult for other crews to see the blue aircraft against a blue sky. To address the CAA&#x27;s safety concerns, Air UK decided to amend its original colour scheme by opting for a hybrid blue-and-white scheme featuring a blue fuselage and a white tail.

Air UK&#x27;s scheduled route network initially served the following 33 points: Aberdeen, Amsterdam, Basel, Belfast, Bergen, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bournemouth, Brussels, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Guernsey, Humberside, Isle of Man, Jersey, Leeds Bradford, Le Touquet, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, London Stansted, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Ostend, Paris, Rotterdam, Southampton, Southend, Stavanger and Teesside.

Air UK was the first and, at the time, only scheduled airline in the UK to fly from all three main London airports.

Following British Airways&#x27; decision to retire its Vickers Viscount turboprop fleet and to withdraw from its loss-making regional scheduled routes, Air UK assumed BA&#x27;s regional routes from Heathrow to Guernsey, Manchester to the Isle of Man, Leeds to Belfast and Dublin, and Edinburgh to Jersey in April 1980. Air UK&#x27;s new, year-round Heathrow—Guernsey route was its most prominent scheduled route serving London&#x27;s premier airport. (During the late 1970s, in the days prior to the construction of the M11, Air UK&#x27;s predecessor Air Anglia had launched a year-round scheduled service linking Heathrow with the company&#x27;s bases in Norwich and Humberside, as well as a year-round scheduled operation between London Gatwick and Leeds.)

===Retrenchment===
The severe recession of the early 1980s necessitated a major retrenchment, resulting in extensive frequency, route and staff cutbacks. This entailed the closure of bases at Bournemouth, Humberside and Stansted as well as a major reduction in operations at Southend. As a consequence of these cutbacks, ten turboprop aircraft (seven Heralds and three Bandeirantes) were withdrawn from service while the two Fokker F28 jets were leased out to French regional carrier Air Alsace. This in turn resulted in the closure of the former BIA engineering base at Blackpool, accounting for 220 out of a total of 400 job losses. It also resulted in the suspension of scheduled passenger and cargo services to 14 points by late 1981. At the start of the 1981–82 winter timetable in November 1981, Air UK relaunched scheduled operations from Stansted by opening a new route to Amsterdam. This was the first international scheduled service from London&#x27;s third airport in over ten years. The resulting network linked 20 points in the British Isles and six in Europe. Management hoped that these business realignments – including cutting the company&#x27;s workforce in half over a two-year period — would reverse heavy losses Air UK had incurred during its first two years of operation, thereby stabilising the company and positioning it for future growth.

===Reorganisation and renewed expansion===
In 1982, Peter Villa led a management buyout of Air UK&#x27;s charter business, resulting in reconstituting BIA as a charter-only airline and his departure from Air UK along with the four BAC One-Eleven 400s. In addition to the tough economic climate and merger blues during the airline&#x27;s inception as a result of combining two organisations with vastly different cultures and management styles, the operation of these aircraft had largely been responsible for Air UK&#x27;s poor financial performance that threatened the airline&#x27;s survival.

1982 was also the year the CAA transferred Air UK&#x27;s Gatwick—Guernsey licence to Guernsey Airlines, a newly formed regional operator, following numerous passenger complaints about the service Air UK had been providing ever since it had assumed the former BIA operation on that route. That year also saw Air UK joining forces with British Midland to form Manx Airlines, a new, jointly owned regional subsidiary based on the Isle of Man. Air UK parent B&amp;C owned 25% of Manx Airlines, making it the new joint venture&#x27;s junior partner. (British Midland, which owned the remaining 75%, was the senior partner.) Air UK and British Midland hoped that transferring their loss-making Isle of Man operations to a dedicated, lower cost subsidiary would eventually make these services profitable.

In 1983, Air UK broke even for the first time. This was also the year the airline acquired its first Shorts 330 commuter turboprop plane, which it named &quot;Enterprise&quot; in a publicity stunt at Stansted Airport where the naming ceremony took place in the shadow of a Boeing 747 shuttle carrier aircraft used by NASA to launch &quot;Space Shuttle Enterprise&quot;.

By 1985, Air UK acquired additional Shorts 330/360s and Fokker F27s. The latter included the first stretched 500 series F27s featuring an increased seating capacity of 52 (as opposed to 44 for all shorter fuselage Fokker F27 models). To further support its ongoing expansion, Air UK temporarily leased an F-28 1000 series as well as two BIA One Eleven 400s during that period. (All of these aircraft wore different, white-based colour schemes.) Reintroduction of jet equipment enabled Air UK to assume British Caledonian&#x27;s regional operation between Glasgow, Newcastle and Amsterdam at the start of the 1985 summer timetable period, thereby further strengthening its position as the UK&#x27;s leading regional feeder operator at Amsterdam Schiphol and as the airport&#x27;s largest foreign scheduled carrier. The additional aircraft also permitted several year-round, domestic and international scheduled services from Stansted to be reinstated.

In 1987, Air UK placed its first order for the British Aerospace 146 regional jetliner. The introduction of Air UK&#x27;s first 146 200 series regional jet coincided with the introduction of a new livery, consisting of a white fuselage and tail with three different blue cheatlines merging into a stylised Union Flag on the aircraft&#x27;s tail. In addition, this livery differed from the previous one by dropping the gap between the words &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;UK&quot; while inserting a gap between the letters &quot;U&quot; and &quot;K&quot; in &quot;UK&quot;.

Following British Airways&#x27; takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987, the CAA awarded Air UK the licences for the ex-BCal domestic feeder routes from Gatwick to Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1988. This resulted in an order for four stretched BAe 146-300s to enable the launch of high-frequency services with up to seven daily round-trips on both routes from the start of the 1988–89 winter timetable period.

By 1994, Air UK acquired several, new Fokker 100 jet aircraft. The introduction of these aircraft led to the adoption of another new livery, the final Air UK-themed livery in the airline&#x27;s 19-year history. This livery combined elements of the earlier livery with a new, single dark blue cheatline that included a thin, pale blue stripe merging into a dark blue tail featuring the previous Union Flag logo. It also combined elements of both previous liveries by dropping the gap between the &quot;U&quot; and &quot;K&quot; in &quot;UK&quot; (as in Air UK&#x27;s original blue livery) as well as dropping the gap between the words &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;UK&quot; (as in the airline&#x27;s second livery).

By 1995, Air UK had replaced all of the older, smaller F27 100/200/400/600 series aircraft in its fleet with additional, stretched F27-500s. (Air UK operated a total of 22 F27s of various marks throughout its existence, all of which it had acquired second-hand.)

By the late 1990s, a fleet of new Fokker 50 and ATR-72 turboprops replaced the aging F27-500s. During that period Air UK also retired all of its 146-200s as well as the 146-100s.

===Air UK Leisure===

In 1987, Air UK established Air UK Leisure as its new charter subsidiary in association with charter brokerage firm Viking International.

Air UK Leisure&#x27;s corporate headquarters were located at Air UK&#x27;s Stansted base. Its main operating bases were at London Gatwick, London Stansted and Manchester.

Operations commenced with three second-hand Boeing 737-200s. These were replaced with seven brand-new 737-400s, making Air UK Leisure first European operator of the 400 in October 1988.

In 1993, Air UK Leisure entered the long-haul leisure market through the acquisition of a pair of Boeing 767 300 ER series widebodied aircraft. Both aircraft were contracted by tour operator Unijet. Although Air UK Leisure operated these aircraft under the same Air Operator Certificate (AOC) as its 737 400 series narrow-bodied short-/medium-haul fleet, it adopted the &quot;Leisure International Airways&quot; brand for its long-haul operation.

Air UK Leisure was subsequently sold to Unijet, which in turn became part of the First Choice group.

===Focusing on Stansted===
Following the move to Stansted in 1988, Air UK became London&#x27;s third airport&#x27;s biggest resident airline and its main scheduled operator. The company began building a comprehensive network of short-haul domestic and European feeder routes that was intended to provide connecting traffic for the long-haul carriers that were then expected to commence operations from Stansted, as a result of the increasingly tight slot situation at both London Heathrow as well as London Gatwick, at the time London&#x27;s two main gateway/hub airports, especially at peak times. Air UK&#x27;s move to the new Norman Foster-designed terminal in early 1991 provided the impetus for the launch of several new, year-round scheduled routes linking Stansted with important business destinations including Belfast, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Inverness, Madrid, Milan Linate, Munich and Zürich (in addition to the existing year-round scheduled routes serving Aberdeen, Amsterdam, Brussels, the Channel Islands, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paris). However, the unfavourable economic conditions in the UK at the time, i.e. the severe early 1990s recession and the fallout from the first Gulf War, resulted in a sharp contraction of both the business and leisure travel markets. This in turn resulted in the spectacular collapse of the International Leisure Group (ILG) and its Air Europe airline subsidiary, at the time the largest independent airline in the UK and Gatwick&#x27;s biggest user, accounting for one-fifth of all the airport&#x27;s slots. The then prevailing harsh economic climate also resulted in route and schedule cutbacks at other major airlines operating out of both main London airports. As a result, it became much easier to obtain viable slots at these airports, including at peak times. This meant that none of the contemporary major long-haul carriers were showing any interest in commencing operations at Stansted (with the sole exception of American Airlines, which ran a short-lived Stansted—Chicago service during the early 1990s). In addition, Stansted&#x27;s considerably smaller catchment area and its greater distance from most parts of London compared with Heathrow and Gatwick, combined with poorer transport links in relation to Heathrow&#x27;s and Gatwick&#x27;s better accessibility, meant that Air UK found it extremely difficult to make its Stansted operation viable.

===Rebranding===

In 1997, KLM became the sole owner of Air UK. This resulted in the airline being rebranded as KLM uk in January 1998, including the adoption of a new livery.

Initially, the rebranded airline launched new routes from London City serving KLM&#x27;s Amsterdam Schiphol hub as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh. However, from January 2000, the KLM uk routes that did not serve Amsterdam were either progressively transferred to Buzz, the KLM group&#x27;s new low-cost carrier, along with the remaining 146-300 aircraft or closed. KLM uk adopted this new strategy in response to its increasing inability to match the far lower costs of the rapidly growing &quot;no frills&quot; competition on the main London—Scotland trunk routes, especially Luton-based EasyJet and former British Airways subsidiary Go based at Stansted itself. By 2001, Buzz operated 14 point-to-point routes from Stansted. Many of these were former Air UK routes served with a fleet of eight BAe 146-300s handed down from Air UK and two independently sourced, second-hand Boeing 737-300s. In addition, scheduled routes not transferred to Buzz and serving destinations other than Amsterdam were eventually all withdrawn, thus reducing the network to only 15 routes exclusively linking regional UK airports to Amsterdam Schiphol. This also resulted in the retirement of KLM uk&#x27;s ATR-72s.

In 2002, KLM decided to integrate what was left of KLM UK into KLM Cityhopper, its wholly owned, Dutch-based regional subsidiary. It also decided to sell Buzz to Ryanair the following year. This transaction constituted the final link in a long chain of events connecting the early- to mid-20th century decision of British &amp; Commonwealth Shipping, a shipping company that could trace its roots to the 19th century, to diversify into commercial aviation through ownership of several of the post-/pre-war independent airlines that merged to form British United Airways, the UK&#x27;s dominant private sector airline conglomerate of the 1960s, with what is arguably the world&#x27;s most commercially successful airline of the first decade of the 21st century.

===Further developments===
By late 2009, several regional point-to-point routes plied by Air UK and its predecessors for many years, which were dropped soon after Dutch flag carrier KLM had become the airline&#x27;s sole owner, had been taken over by Eastern Airways and Flybe, with the former concentrating on the ex-Air Anglia oil-related business routes along Britain&#x27;s East Coast and the latter focusing on former BIA/Air Westward routes serving the southern and western parts of the UK.

==Incidents and accidents==
There were four recorded non-fatal incidents during Air UK&#x27;s 19-year existence from 1980 until 1998.

* On 11 June 1984, an empty ex-BIA Handley Page Dart Herald (registration: G-BBXI), was parked at Bournemouth Airport when a lorry struck the aircraft and damaged it beyond repair.
* On 19 July 1990, an ex-Air Anglia F-27-200 (registration G-BCDO) had an accident while landing at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport at the end of a scheduled flight from London Stansted. The aircraft&#x27;s right-hand main gear failed to lock down while preparing to land. This resulted in a forced landing with the right gear retracted, damaging the aircraft beyond repair. There were no injuries among the 17 passengers and four crew members. (The aircraft was subsequently ferried to Air UK&#x27;s base at Norwich Airport, where it was withdrawn from service and scrapped.)
* On 31 March 1992, a BAe 146-300 G-UKHP overran runway 34 at Aberdeen (Dyce) Airport after landing on a wet runway with high crosswinds. The pilot failed to deploy the spoilers and ran off the end of the runway. The aircraft was not badly damaged and no passengers were hurt.
* On 7 December 1997, an F-27-500F (registration: G-BNCY) had an accident at Guernsey Airport at the end of a scheduled service from Southampton. The aircraft overran the runway while landing in high crosswinds and came to rest in an adjacent field with its left landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries among the 50 passengers and four crew. (The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and subsequently written off.)

<text>Sir Herbert Geraint Williams, 1st Baronet, (2 December 1884 – 25 July 1954) was a British politician and Conservative Member of Parliament (MP).

==Biography==
Herbert Williams was born in Hooton, Cheshire, on 2 December 1884. He was educated at Liverpool University with degrees in science and engineering. In 1911 he became secretary and manager of the Machine Tools Trade Association. He served on Wimbledon Borough Council.

Williams contested the Combined English Universities in 1918 and Wednesbury in 1922 and 1923 without success.
From 1924 to 1929, Williams was MP for Reading and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was a member of the first Court of the University of Reading following its receipt of a Royal Charter in 1926.

Williams was returned to Parliament in Croydon South in a by-election in February 1932. He was comfortably re-elected in 1935 and served through the war. He was vocal in arguing against the Beveridge Report in Parliament, despite it being proposed by his Croydon Conservative colleague, Henry Willink MP. He was an alderman of London County Council in 1940–45.

Sir Herbert lost his seat in the 1945 General Election to Labour&#x27;s David Rees-Williams. In February 1950, the Croydon seats were rearranged and the Conservatives won all three seats. Sir Herbert was returned in the new Croydon East seat and was re-elected in 1951. He was made a baronet on 3 July 1953.

He died in 1954 aged 69 and a by-election was held in his seat in September.

==Legacy==
Herbert Williams wrote books on parliamentary matters, including &quot;The Member of Parliament and his Constituency.&quot;

Sir Herbert&#x27;s daughter, Rosemary, married Glasgow property millionaire Sir Ian Mactaggart, Bt. Their daughter, Fiona Mactaggart was the Labour MP for Slough from 1997 to 2017

<doc id="1248656" wikidata="Q523303" url="?curid=1248656" title="Sender Donebach">
<text>The Sender Donebach was a 500-kilowatt long wave radio transmitter operating on 153 kHz and transmitting the program of German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. The facility, which was the property of Media Broadcast, was built between 1965 and 1967 on a former airfield, and entered service on March 10, 1967.

It was part of an omnidirectional aerial, consisting of four 200-metre-high radio masts, which were connected using wires on their tops. The middle mast was fed via radio power. This very efficient transmission aerial led to interference with the Romanian transmitter Braşov on the same frequency, so only 70 kilowatts of power were used, instead of 250. But even with this reduced power, interference to Braşov occurred, so in 1972 the radio facility Donebach was rebuilt as a directional aerial with a minimum towards Braşov. Therefore, two radio masts were taken down and the remaining two were rebuilt as umbrella aerials. This made a transmission power of 250 kilowatts possible.

The Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 set new power limits to the Donebach transmitter and now there was a daytime operation with 500 kilowatts and a night time operation at night time. 
This facility was remarkable because 
*the frequency of the carrier was derived from a rubidium atomic clock, which was in the station building. It was as the carrier frequency of DCF77, a standard frequency.
*the 363-metre-high masts were the second tallest structures in Germany, just behind the Fernsehturm Berlin.

<doc id="1248659" wikidata="Q1059108" url="?curid=1248659" title="When Johnny Comes Marching Home">
<text>&quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; (Roud 6637), sometimes &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again&quot;, is a song from the American Civil War that expressed people&#x27;s longing for the return of their friends and relatives who were fighting in the war.

==Origins==
Irish-American bandleader Patrick Gilmore wrote the lyrics to &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; during the American Civil War. Its first publication was deposited in the Library of Congress on September 26, 1863, with words and music credited to &quot;Louis Lambert&quot;; copyright was retained by the publisher, Henry Tolman &amp; Co., of Boston. Why Gilmore published under a pseudonym is unclear, but popular songwriters of the period often employed pseudonyms to add a touch of romantic mystery to their songs. Gilmore is said to have written the song for his sister Annie as she prayed for the safe return of her fiancé, Union Light Artillery Captain John O&#x27;Rourke, from the Civil War, although it is not clear if they were already engaged in 1863; the two were not married until 1875.

Gilmore later acknowledged that the music was not original but was, as he put it in an 1883 article in the &quot;Musical Herald,&quot; &quot;a musical waif which I happened to hear somebody humming in the early days of the rebellion, and taking a fancy to it, wrote it down, dressed it up, gave it a name, and rhymed it into usefulness for a special purpose suited to the times.&quot;

The melody was previously published around July 1, 1863, as the music to the Civil War drinking song &quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot;. A color-illustrated, undated slip of Gilmore&#x27;s lyrics, printed by his own Boston publisher, actually states that &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; should be sung to the tune of &quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot;. The original sheet music for &quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot; states that the music was arranged (not composed) by J. Durnal. There is a melodic resemblance of the tune to that of &quot;John Anderson, My Jo&quot; (to which Robert Burns wrote lyrics to fit a pre-existing tune dating from about 1630 or earlier), and Jonathan Lighter has suggested a connection to the 17th-century ballad &quot;The Three Ravens&quot;.

&quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; is also sung to the same tune as &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; and is frequently thought to have been a rewriting of that song. &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; was not published until 1867, however, and it originally had a different melody.

&quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; was immensely popular and was sung by both sides of the American Civil War. It became a hit in England and Ireland as well and was eventually lyrically rewritten and became the related tune &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot;.

===Alternative versions===
Quite a few variations on the song, as well as songs set to the same tune but with different lyrics, have appeared since &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; was popularized. The alleged larcenous tendencies of some Union soldiers in New Orleans were parodied in the lyrics &quot;For Bales&quot;, to the same tune. A British version appeared in 1914 with a similar title, &quot;When Tommy Comes Marching Home&quot;. The 1880 U.S. presidential election campaign featured a campaign song called &quot;If the Johnnies Get into Power,&quot; which supported the Republicans James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur against the &quot;Johnnies&quot; (Democrats Winfield S. Hancock and William H. English).

The children&#x27;s songs, &quot;Ants Go Marching&quot;, or &quot;Ants Go Marching One By One&quot;, and &quot;The Animals Went in Two by Two&quot; (&quot;Into the Ark&quot;) re-used the tune and the refrain.

==Lyrics==


The original lyrics, written by Patrick Gilmore during the American Civil War, were published in 1863 in Erastus Beadle&#x27;s booklet, &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Dime Song Book, No. 15: A Collection of New and Popular Comic and Sentimental Songs&quot; in pages 18 and 19.

Some later recordings substitute &quot;glad&quot; for &quot;gay&quot;. 

In the John Ford western &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot;, the last line was changed to &quot;And we&#x27;ll all &quot;raise hell&quot; when Johnny comes marching home&quot;.

==&quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot;==

&quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot;, which provided the tune for &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, was a topical drinking song that commented on events in the American Civil War. It was frequently refitted with new words by soldiers and other publishers.

A satirical variant of &quot;Johnny Fill Up the Bowl&quot;, entitled &quot;For Bales&quot; or, more fully, &quot;For Bales! An O&#x27;er True Tale. Dedicated to Those Pure Patriots Who Were Afflicted with &#x27;Cotton on the Brain&#x27; and Who Saw The Elephant&quot;, was published in New Orleans in 1864, by A. E. Blackmar.

==Notable recordings==
The song became popular during World War II with recordings in 1942 by Glenn Miller on RCA Bluebird Records with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires, and Guy Lombardo and The Andrews Sisters on Decca Records.

In 1959, Mitch Miller recorded the song, followed by Jaye P. Morgan the following year.

Jazz organist Jimmy Smith recorded a version for his 1960 album, &quot;Crazy! Baby&quot;.

English pop singer Adam Faith sang a version titled &quot;Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, used over the opening and closing title credits for the British crime thriller &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960). This version was arranged and conducted by John Barry. Another version was released as a single, reaching No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart.

British punk band The Clash recorded a reworded version in 1978 titled &quot;English Civil War (Johnny Comes Marching Home)&quot;. This version was covered by The Levellers on the &quot;Julie&quot; EP released in 1994.

In 1983–84, the French punk band Bérurier Noir took up the melody on the track (English: &quot;Johnny returns from the war&quot;) from the album &quot;Macadam Massacre&quot;.

The song Civil War (song) from the 1991 album Use Your Illusion II by the US band Guns N&#x27; Roses uses the melody of the song &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; in the Axl Rose whistle in the intro and outro of the song.

The 2015 anime film Girls und Panzer der Film recorded an original orchestra rendition of the track.

<text>Samuel Greg (26 March 1758 – 4 June 1834) was an Irish-born businessman and industrialist of the Industrial Revolution and a pioneer of the factory system. Born in Belfast, Ireland, he moved to England and built Quarry Bank Mill in Styal, Cheshire, which at his retirement was the largest textile mill in the country. He and his wife Hannah Greg assumed welfare responsibilities for their employees, many of whom were children, building a model village alongside the factory. At the same time, Greg inherited and operated a slave plantation in the West Indies.

==Atlantic-trading Belfast family==
Greg was born in Belfast, Ireland, the second son, and one of thirteen children, born to Elizabeth (Hyde) (1721–1780) and Thomas Greg of Belfast (1718 – 1796). With his business partner and brother-in-law, Waddell Cunningham, Thomas Greg commanded one of the greatest mercantile fortunes in Ireland.

The son of a Scottish blacksmith, in the 1740s Thomas Greg bought a small ship which carried salted provisions, linen and butter to the West Indies and returned with flaxseed. Dealings in New York brought him into contact and partnership with Waddell Cunningham, another Belfast Presbyterian. By 1775 Greg and Cunningham was one of the largest shipping companies in New York, having benefitted from the rise in the prices of provisions during the Seven Years’ War, a licence to attack enemy and plunder enemy vessels, and the opportunity to smuggle to the embargoed French colonies. After the war, Greg and Cunningham set up a sugar plantation on Dominica called &quot;Belfast&quot; for which Thomas Greg&#x27;s brother John, already established on the island, supplied slaves via the Atlantic slave trade.

At home, as Belfast&#x27;s richest merchants, the partners played a leading role in improving the town&#x27;s port and commercial infrastructure, including construction of the White Linen Hall which attracted the linen trade from the north of Ireland that had formerly gone through Dublin.

At the age of eight, Samuel Greg was sent to live with his maternal uncle, Robert Hyde, at Ardwick Hall, Manchester, in the heart of England. His uncles, Robert and Nathaniel, were linen merchants and, after completing his education at Harrow School, near London, Samuel joined their business in 1778.

==Marriage to Hannah Lightbody==

In 1789 Greg married Hannah Lightbody (1766–1828), the daughter of a wealthy Liverpool merchant. At Cross Street Chapel, Hannah introduced Samuel (raised Presbyterian) to Unitarianism, a latitudinarian faith indulgent of &quot;rational dissent&quot;. The new church was also his introduction to an influential network of Manchester and Liverpool trading and banking families. Greg was active as a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.

Hannah had completed her education at a Unitarian academy at Stoke Newington outside London, where she lived with her cousin Thomas Rogers, a close friend and an immediate neighbour to Richard Price. Richard Price was the &quot;non-conforming minister of eminence&quot; that Edmund Burke pilloried in his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) as the leading light of a circle of &quot;literary caballers and intriguing philosophers&quot; naïve and seditious in their embrace of the French revolutionary doctrine. It was in this same circle that Samuel&#x27;s older sister Jane Greg moved, associating with John Horne Tooke of the London Corresponding Society (arrested, but acquitted, in 1794 of high treason) and Irish radical Roger O&#x27;Connor. Although the extent of her activities are unclear, in suppressing the Society of United Irishmen in advance of their Irish rebellion of 1798, British commander Gerard Lake described Jane Greg as &quot;the most violent creature possible&quot; and as someone who had caused &quot;very great [political] mischief&quot; in her native Belfast.

Hannah&#x27;s religious and social views are credited with influencing Samuel&#x27;s approach to the workers&#x27; welfare. A former director of the Quarry Bank Mill, and author of a book about Hannah Greg, provided this summary of her philosophy and work. She was liberal and compassionate by nature, and all her friends were active campaigners to stop the slave trade and to move forward the emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies and America ... In reality, Hannah Greg did not say anything publicly about this because, apart from anything else, Samuel Greg inherited slave plantations. She couldn’t be a public hypocrite so she kept quiet.

==Paternalistic employer==

With the death of Robert Hyde in 1782, Greg took over his uncle&#x27;s interests in Manchester. Convinced of the prospects for mechanised textile production and the latest developments in water and steam power, Greg invested his wife&#x27;s £10,000 dowry in building the Quarry Bank Mill in Styal on the bank of the River Bollin in Cheshire. The difficulty, in the rural setting, was labour. Hannah Greg&#x27;s influence has been seen in what might otherwise be seen as a hard-headed, if unusual, decision to invest in improved conditions so as to make the new and regimented mill work attractive. In Styal Greg developed what came to be considered a &quot;model village&quot;. Each family (average of eight people per family) had a cottage built offering a parlour, a kitchen, two bedrooms, a cistern, a backyard and a good-sized vegetable garden. 

This alone was not sufficient: from 1790 operations were relying upon children—half the workforce. Factory owners, like Greg, were paid between £2 and £4 for each workhouse child they employed. The children, housed in an Apprentice House, received their board and lodging, and two pence a week. The younger children worked as scavengers and piecers, but after a couple of years at Styal they were allowed to become involved in spinning and carding. Some of the more older boys became skilled mechanics. The arrangement was still operating in 1835 when Andrew Ure observed &quot;at a little distance from the factory, on a sunny bank, stands a handsome house, two stories high, built for the accommodation of the female apprentices. They are well fed, clothed and educated. The apprentices have milk-porridge for breakfast, potatoes and bacon for dinner, and meat on Sundays&quot;.

A former director of the Quarry Bank Mill, and author of a book about Hannah Greg, provided this summary of child labour at the mill, based on extensive research.Over half of Samuel Greg’s workforce were poor and orphaned children ... the children were given good medical care by the Greg family doctor, and education in writing and maths three nights a week ... although the child workers were not subjected to corporal punishment, bad behaviour brought overtime, threats that girls would have their heads shaved or young workers being locked in a room for days on a porridge-only diet&quot;.

The children were overseen by Hannah Greg, who delivered the services of a doctor, two teachers and two singing masters. After the children&#x27;s thirteen-hour shift, Hannah provided them with lessons in reading, writing and arithmetic. When she was in Styal she delivered the lessons to the girls, and preached to them on Sundays.[18] The Greg children, of which she and Samuel had thirteen, were expected to take part in the teaching. It was part of her dissenting belief that people should mix together, be frugal and accept their responsibilities to others.

By 1816 Quarry Bank employed 252 people and was producing 342,578 pounds of cotton cloth. Ten years later, the mill was employing 380 and output had reached 699,223 pounds. As well as taking a large share of the home market, Samuel Greg was also selling cloth to Italy, France, North America, Russia, Germany and South America. The success of Quarry Bank Mill encouraged Greg to open mills at Caton (150 workers), Lancaster (560 workers), Bury (544 workers), Bollington (450 workers). By 1831 Samuel Greg &amp; Company, in which the engineer Peter Ewart and Greg&#x27;s four sons were partners, owned five factories, over 4,000 power looms, employed over 2,000 people and turned four million pounds of cotton into cloth. Overall, Samuel Greg &amp; Company was producing 0.6% of all yarn and 1.03% of all cloth produced in Britain.

==Slave owner==
The Styal community was not the model for all Greg&#x27;s operations, and its clear that there were limits to his relative beneficence as an employer. In 1795, with his brother Thomas, Samuel Greg had inherited, and continued to operate as a slave plantation, the Hillsborough Estate on the West Indian island of Dominica, from his paternal uncle John Greg. The Gregs supplied the enslaved Africans on the estate with clothing and blankets made at Quarry Bank Mill.

There were of 71 male slaves and 68 female slaves on the Hillsborough Estate when, in January 1814, twenty absconded. They were recaptured and punished with 100 lashes for the males and 50 lashes for the females.

In September 2020, the National Trust, (owner of Quarry Bank Mill and Styal Estate), provided this concise summary of the family&#x27;s involvement with the slave trade: the mill &quot;was built using family wealth related to slavery&quot;. &quot;Samuel Greg ... his father Thomas and uncle John had interests in four estates in Dominica and St Vincent, ... while Samuel and his brother Thomas inherited the Hillsborough plantation in Dominica and other estates&quot;.

In 2020, the National Trust was working on a plan to include displays about the original owners&#x27; links to colonialism and slavery in the Americas.

==Heirs==
In 1832, Greg was attacked by a stag in the grounds of Quarry Bank Mill. The injury led to his retirement. By this time, it had become the largest spinning and weaving business in the United Kingdom. Greg never recovered from the attack and died two years later.

Of Hannah and Samuel&#x27;s thirteen children Robert Hyde Greg continued in the textile business and became a Member of Parliament for Manchester in 1839 opposed to extension of the franchise and to factory legislation; Samuel Rathbone Greg had little inclination for business and developed a career as a writer and critic publishing in 1840 &quot;Past and Present Efforts for the Extinction of the African Slave Trade&quot; in which he argued that cotton, sugar and coffee could be grown more cheaply by free labour; Elizabeth Greg (married to William Rathbone V) founded the first public wash-houses in the United Kingdom in the wake of the 1832 cholera epidemic, and later helped William Forster in formulating the 1870 Education Act. Ellen Maria married George Melly and he and their daughter Florence Melly took an interest in improving education.

The estate and mill were eventually inherited by Robert Hyde Greg and then by Alexander Carlton Greg, who donated the site in 1939 to the National Trust.

<text>″t Hof van Commerce is a Belgian hip hop crew from Izegem in the province West Flanders in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Their name means &#x27;commercial court&#x27; in their local dialect. Almost all their raps/lyrics are in West Flemish, the Dutch dialect of the province of West Flanders, with the exception of some lines sung in Limburgish by DJ 4T4 or a mix between those two dialects.

Band members are Filip Cauwelier (a.k.a. Levrancier, a.k.a. Flip Kowlier), Serge Buyse (a.k.a. Dommestik, a.k.a. BZA, pronounce: &quot;buzze&quot;) and Kristof Michiels (DJ 4T4). Ex-members include Johnny de Pony (a.k.a. Georges De Keesmaecker) and Floerke den Aap (a.k.a. Wilhelm De Tura).

==History==

It started with the crossover band &quot;The Prophets of Finance&quot; which stopped around 1993–1994. In 1997, &quot;&#x27;t Hof van Commerce&quot; was founded, and in 1998, they release their first album &quot;En in Izzegem&quot;, referring to the little city Izegem where the band was founded. About 8000 albums were sold. That was quite a high number for a debut because the entire CD was sung in West Flemish, only understood by about one million people. The next year, they already had a second CD with the title &quot;Herman&quot;. That album was sold 5000 times.

In 2000 Flip Kowlier started a successful solo career as a singer-songwriter, while staying a member of &quot; &#x27;t Hof van Commerce&quot;. Two years later, in 2002, they got their third album, titled &quot;Rocky 7&quot;. That album was their biggest success this far, with 10 000 sells. So in 2003, &quot;&#x27;t Hof&quot; (how they call themselves) was asked a lot in festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands.

In 2005, &quot;&#x27;t Hof&quot; released another album with the title &quot;Ezoa en niet anders&quot; &quot;(This way and not differently)&quot;. For the first time under their own record label &quot;Plasticine&quot;. For that record, a lot of guest rappers were invited such as TLP and Gabriel Rios.

In 2011, Flip Kowlier temporarily stopped his (still successful) solo career, to continue with &quot;&#x27;t Hof van Commerce&quot; after a long silence. This resulted in a new album in 2012 with the title &quot;Stuntman&quot;.

&quot;&#x27;t Hof van Commerce&quot; has been on hiatus between October 2013 and January 2018.

<doc id="1248684" wikidata="Q5625550" url="?curid=1248684" title="Gytrash">
<text>The Gytrash was a legendary shape-changer known in parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was said to haunt lonely roads awaiting travelers. Appearing usually in the shape of animals (horses, mules, and dogs among others), the Gytrash haunt solitary ways and lead people astray, but they can also be benevolent, guiding lost travelers to the right road. They are usually feared. The Gytrash is a shapechanging cousin of the Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire Shagfoal, of the Lancashire Skriker, of the Padfoot, also from the West Riding and of Barguest of much of the North Riding, Cumberland, Lincolnshire, County Durham and Northumberland.

The most important gytrash references appear in the writings of the Brontës.

The Gytrash&#x27;s emergence as Rochester&#x27;s innocuous dog Pilot has been interpreted as a subtle mockery of the mysteriousness and romanticism that surrounds his character and which clouds Jane&#x27;s perception. Brontë&#x27;s reference in 1847 is the earliest reference to the beast in print and forms the basis for subsequent citations.

Branwell Brontë referred to the guytrash in his unpublished writing in December 1837, predating Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s reference: &#x27;A Gytrash is a Spectre neither at all similar to the Ghosts of those who once were alive nor to fairys and silvan Creatures nor to Demons and the powers of the air[.] It does not confine its forms to the Human and indeed most seldom appears in such a form[.] A Black Dog dragging a chain a dusky calf[,] nay even a rolling stone or a self impelled cart wheel are more commonly the mortal coil of the Sullen Spectre[.] But the Darkwall Gytrash was known by the form of an Old Dwarfish and hideous Man as often seen without a head as with one and moving at dark along the naked feilds which spread round the Aged House[.] its visits were connected in all mens minds with the fortunes of the family[.] he hovered round and evil omens were always drawn on such occasions and if tradition spoke true fullfilled upon them.&#x27;

This spirit is also known as Guytrash and Guytresh according to &quot;The English Dialect Dictionary&quot; of Joseph Wright (1855–1930) where it is defined as a ghost that takes the form of an animal. These include a &quot;great black dog&quot; as well as &quot;an evil cow whose appearance was formerly believed in as a sign of death.&quot;

<text>Sky Open (formerly known as Prime) is a New Zealand free-to-air television network. It airs a varied mix of programming, largely imported from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

It was originally owned by Prime Television Limited in Australia. Prime later entered into a joint-venture agreement with Nine Entertainment Co. (Nine Network Australia) in February 2002, causing the network&#x27;s graphics to look like the Nine Network. On 8 February 2006, the Commerce Commission gave Sky clearance to purchase the station for NZ$31 million.

Prime&#x27;s analogue terrestrial signals had covered 91% of the population via the state-owned Kordia transmission network. It is currently available free-to-air on Sky on satellite and Kordia on terrestrial.

==History==

=== Prime (1998–2023) ===

During early 1998, the United Christian Broadcasters purchased 34 TV licences of UHF spectrum from TVNZ that had been used for the defunct Horizon Pacific and MTV channels. Then during June 1998, Prime Television Limited in Australia purchased the unused 34 TV licences from United Christian Broadcasters for approximately A$3.6 million. The licences covered all major cities and towns, mainly on UHF, except for the Gisborne area, which is served via a VHF signal. On 30 August 1998, Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting at 6.30 pm with &quot;Two Fat Ladies&quot;.

Originally the station broadcast classic British programming, documentaries, sports and dramas aimed at the 30 years and above age bracket. In Waikato and Christchurch, Prime produced a half-hour nightly news programme. Although these programmes rated well, they were unprofitable.

In February 2002, Prime New Zealand entered into an agreement with Australian media mogul Kerry Packer&#x27;s PBL (parent of the Nine Network). Under this five-year agreement, Nine agreed to provide the station with content it owned the rights to, expertise and an amount of cash. In return, Nine was given the right to acquire 54% of Prime New Zealand at the end of the contract. If Prime New Zealand continued to lose money, Nine could choose not to take this up.

After this deal, Prime took on a broader and more expensive programming mix and axed the local content to cut costs. This increased ratings and profits significantly. This new format was modelled closely on the Global Television Network in Canada, whose parent company Canwest happened to own TV3 at the time.

Almost immediately, some Australian programmes produced by Nine Network and shown on Prime NZ took on a slightly New Zealand flavour. For example, one New Zealander per week began to appear on the Australian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, and weather details for New Zealand cities appeared on the Australian &quot;Today&quot; breakfast programme. Localisation of Australian programmes increased, with New Zealander Charlotte Dawson becoming the presenter of a New Zealand version of Nine travel programme &quot;Getaway&quot; (Dawson left this position at the end of 2006). Many Australian programmes were simply broadcast on Prime without any adaptation for New Zealand audiences, however.

During 2003–04, the number of Australian programmes broadcast decreased. These were largely replaced with more expensive (and higher rated) British and American programmes, such as a Sunday evening British drama slot.

On 2 November 2004, TVNZ presenter Paul Holmes announced that he was resigning from his &quot;Holmes&quot; programme on the state broadcaster and beginning a new one on Prime in 2005. This new programme, called &quot;Paul Holmes&quot;, began on 7 February 2005. The arrival of Holmes was seen as a major sign of Prime&#x27;s rise in status, from a small, second-tier network to a major player on the New Zealand scene, joining TVNZ and TV3 in this regard. The programme, however, did not rate well. In June 2005, Prime moved the show to 6 pm, directly following &quot;Prime News&quot;, in an attempt to increase ratings. This was ultimately unsuccessful and Prime TV cancelled the programme on 8 August 2005 due to poor ratings. Holmes returned to host a one-hour weekly current affairs/interview programme, which was still called &quot;Holmes&quot;, and screened on Thursday evenings. In 2006, the show was relaunched as a strictly entertainment-oriented talk show and screened on Wednesday evenings. It did not return in 2007, but two &quot;specials&quot; were filmed. For most of 2007, Holmes&#x27; work for Prime consisted solely of a weekly opinion segment, broadcast Sunday nights as part of Prime News.

In late December 2004, Prime announced it had acquired New Zealand broadcast rights for the new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, one of its highest-profile imported shows, which went on to screen in June 2005 to generally good ratings until December 2017 when TVNZ 2 took over the broadcasting rights to the show.

In 2005, Prime announced that it would broadcast a minimum of 5.5% of local programmes, following recommendations from NZ On Air.

From 6 October 2005, Prime showed a weekly programme called &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s Top 100 History Makers&quot;, where a brief biography of notable New Zealanders was shown as ranked by a panel of experts. The final episode, screened on 17 November 2005, showed the rankings of these people as a result of votes collected from the public via text and Internet.

In November 2005, Sky Television purchased Prime for NZ$30 million. The deal was subject to Commerce Commission approval and undisclosed conditions. On 8 February 2006, following receipt of Commerce Commission clearance, Sky Television purchased Prime New Zealand from Australian-based Prime Television. The acquisition of Prime by Sky Television saw a range of shows screened on Sky channels now included on Prime, these shows included &quot;American Chopper&quot; and &quot;MythBusters&quot;, which screen on the Discovery Channel.

In December 2005, it was announced that Prime had secured the 2006 free-to-air delayed broadcast of rugby union from TV3.

On 4 September 2006, the network relaunched with a modified logo, already seen in print advertisements, and new on-air branding.

In April 2008, Prime switch to broadcasting in a lower quality anamorphic widescreen 16:9 format following the lead of other Freeview and Sky channels. Previously they had opted to use the more proportionally scaled letterboxed format for 16:9 content. They like other Kordia PAL analogue broadcasters are using a 14:9 letterbox format on their PAL simulcast.

Prime signed a deal with CBS Television Distribution to air exclusive first run content from 1 January 2013.

On 13 February 2016, Prime underwent a brand refresh and began permanently broadcasting in High Definition.

In 2018, &quot;Love Island&quot; started showing on this channel shifting from TVNZ 2.

On 28 March 2023, Prime updated with a new look featuring the outline version of the 2016 logo.

On 17 August 2023, it was announced that Prime would change its name to Sky Open on 23 August 2023.

=== High Definition ===
In 2010, Prime HD was temporarily launched only on Sky TV Channel 140 to cover the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Prime HD was only available during every Olympics or Commonwealth games on Channel 444. Freeview HD viewers did not have the option to see the Olympic or Commonwealth games in high definition.

On 13 February 2016, Prime underwent a brand refresh and began permanently broadcasting in High Definition.

On 11 December 2019, Prime was made available in HD to Freeview DTT viewers.

=== Freeview ===
On 7 May 2007, a consortium of broadcasters including TVNZ, MediaWorks (owners of TV3 and C4), Maori Television Service, and Radio New Zealand launched the non-profit, free-to-air Freeview service, the nationwide digital free-to-air system in New Zealand. The service was initially broadcast via the Optus D1 satellite in standard definition only, but in April 2008 extended to a high definition digital terrestrial service which is broadcast in main centres only.

Prime was widely expected to be included in the initial group of Freeview channels, but Sky Television had consistently refused to take part, citing poor economics. Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman then asked officials to invite Sky, Freeview and state-owned transmission company Kordia to meet him to discuss the matter, but Sky TV spokesman Tony O&#x27;Brien was quoted as saying &quot;It is not economic for Prime to be on Freeview at this time.&quot; The economics had to do with non-government-owned broadcasters paying less for transmission costs on the government-owned Kordia network.

A deal between TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 available to Sky subscribers in exchange for Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual channel assignment of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then they may have been able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on &quot;certified&quot; receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky&#x27;s former analogue terrestrial service, and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.

Prime joined Freeview on 17 August 2009 and is broadcasting in the clear on both the satellite and terrestrial services.

From October 2013, Sky ceased the encryption on the three regional satellite feeds for Prime, so they could be used for channel locked, Freeview certified satellite receivers. However, TVNZ is still only linking to the Auckland regional feed for all areas.

Prime swapped Freeview positions with Te Reo, on 1 March 2023, with Prime moving to channel 15, and Te Reo moving to channel 10.

== News First ==

From launch Prime broadcast local newscasts in Christchurch and Hamilton on weeknights at 5:30pm. Christchurch&#x27;s bulletin was anchored by Vanessa Rawson, with Mei Taare anchoring Hamilton&#x27;s bulletin. Both bulletins ran for half an hour, but due to intense competition for local news in Christchurch and a lack of viewership, both bulletins were cancelled. Prime launched a nightly news bulletin – branded as Prime News – First at 5:30, from 2004. Unlike their early foray into local news, the new bulletins were screened nationwide and as a result, held a stronger national focus.

It was confirmed on April 10 of 2024, News First at 5:30PM would cease production due to Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s closure of the Newshub newsroom. It is unknown whether the newscast &quot;could be salvaged, whether or not it was under the Newshub banner,&quot; according to Stuff NZ.

2006–2015

In 2006 Prime and Sky TV moved to a new broadcast hub in Albany near Auckland New Zealand, A new studio and host Eric Young coincided with the move and a relaunch of Prime. Prime News, and used the same graphics and music as its sister bulletin Sky News, it also sourced more local content sourced primarily from 3 News.

The role of sports newsreader was held by Suzy Clarkson (née Aiken), and newcomers Kelly Swanson-Roe and Ross Karl, with Clarkson also reading the weekend news. 
Political coverage was provided by Newstalk ZB political editor Barry Soper, along with several other Wellington-based reporters, at this stage Prime had no full-time South Island reporters.

During the Rugby World Cup 2011, Prime News hosted several bulletins from the ANZ Viaduct Events Centre in Central Auckland.

During the 2012 London Olympic Games Prime News broadcast from a temporary shared space with Sky Sport.
2015-2023

On 23 January 2015 it was announced that Prime News will be Produced by MediaWorks (now produced by Warner Bros. Discovery NZ), and it was confirmed that Janika ter Ellen, and Wayne Hay will replace Eric Young due to his current commitments he was unable to present the show.

The new look show debuted on Sunday 1 March presented by Janika ter Ellen. 
On Monday 13 April Eric Young returned as Weekday Anchor, with Wayne Hay moving to 60 Minutes and Janika ter Ellen staying at weekends.

On 16 February 2016 a new look logo was launched and news began being presented and broadcast in High Definition.

As part of the rebranding to Sky Open on 23 August 2023, Prime News was rebranded as News First.

=== Current affairs ===

Current affairs is provided as a New Zealand-hosted version of the CBS show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with the bulk of the stories coming from the foreign show.

Hosts included:

2015 : Charlotte Bellis

2016 : Alistair Wilkinson

== Programming ==

=== Sports ===

With Prime 100% owned by Sky Network Television, it has access to a large selection of sports content that Sky broadcasts, this content is typically delayed with some live coverage of certain events to fulfill free-to-air requirements, as Sky is effectively selling them to itself. Prime used to broadcast a weekly Sunday afternoon sports highlights show called &quot;Ultimate Sport Sunday&quot;, which included highlights of cricket, rugby union, NRL, Formula One, WRC and Moto GP.

Prime was also granted the rights to broadcast the free to air screening of Euro 2008. Free to air coverage of the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics was seen on Prime with Sky being the new rights holder. Prime is the Free TV broadcaster of the ANZ Premiership and shows highlights weekly. Prime also broadcasts one-hour versions of WWE Raw, WWE NXT and WWE Smackdown.

===NZ On Air funded===

===Past/ended locally-made programmes===
=== Past news programming ===

Prime used to broadcast Nine Network Australia&#x27;s early morning news programmes such as &quot;Today&quot; and, until 6 February 2007, &quot;National Nine News: Morning Edition&quot; when the Nine Network had ownership. Overnight, and during important international news events such as the 2008 US Presidential Election, it has relayed the international feed of US news channel Fox News.

===Output contracts===
* Paramount Global Distribution Group (exclusive)

<doc id="1248704" wikidata="Q1952929" url="?curid=1248704" title="Ideal theory">
<text>In mathematics, ideal theory is the theory of ideals in commutative rings. While the notion of an ideal exists also for non-commutative rings, a much more substantial theory exists only for commutative rings (and this article therefore only considers ideals in commutative rings.)

Throughout the articles, rings refer to commutative rings. See also the article ideal (ring theory) for basic operations such as sum or products of ideals.

== Ideals in a finitely generated algebra over a field ==

Ideals in a finitely generated algebra over a field (that is, a quotient of a polynomial ring over a field) behave somehow nicer than those in a general commutative ring. First, in contrast to the general case, if formula_1 is a finitely generated algebra over a field, then the radical of an ideal in formula_1 is the intersection of all maximal ideals containing the ideal (because formula_1 is a Jacobson ring). This may be thought of as an extension of Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, which concerns the case when formula_1 is a polynomial ring.

== Topology determined by an ideal ==
If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal in a ring &quot;A&quot;, then it determines the topology on &quot;A&quot; where a subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is open if, for each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;U&quot;,
:formula_5
for some integer formula_6. This topology is called the &quot;I&quot;-adic topology. It is also called an &quot;a&quot;-adic topology if formula_7 is generated by an element formula_8.

For example, take formula_9, the ring of integers and formula_10 an ideal generated by a prime number &quot;p&quot;. For each integer formula_11, define formula_12 when formula_13, formula_14 prime to formula_15. Then, clearly,
:formula_16
where formula_17 denotes an open ball of radius formula_18 with center formula_11. Hence, the formula_15-adic topology on formula_21 is the same as the metric space topology given by formula_22. As a metric space, formula_21 can be completed. The resulting complete metric space has a structure of a ring that extended the ring structure of formula_21; this ring is denoted as formula_25 and is called the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers.

== Ideal class group ==
In a Dedekind domain &quot;A&quot; (e.g., a ring of integers in a number field or the coordinate ring of a smooth affine curve) with the field of fractions formula_26, an ideal formula_27 is invertible in the sense: there exists a fractional ideal formula_28 (that is, an &quot;A&quot;-submodule of formula_26) such that formula_30, where the product on the left is a product of submodules of &quot;K&quot;. In other words, fractional ideals form a group under a product. The quotient of the group of fractional ideals by the subgroup of principal ideals is then the ideal class group of &quot;A&quot;.

In a general ring, an ideal may not be invertible (in fact, already the definition of a fractional ideal is not clear). However, over a Noetherian integral domain, it is still possible to develop some theory generalizing the situation in Dedekind domains. For example, Ch. VII of Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Algèbre commutative&quot; gives such a theory.

The ideal class group of &quot;A&quot;, when it can be defined, is closely related to the Picard group of the spectrum of &quot;A&quot; (often the two are the same; e.g., for Dedekind domains).

In algebraic number theory, especially in class field theory, it is more convenient to use a generalization of an ideal class group called an idele class group.

== Closure operations ==
There are several operations on ideals that play roles of closures. The most basic one is the radical of an ideal. Another is the integral closure of an ideal. Given an irredundant primary decomposition formula_31, the intersection of formula_32&#x27;s whose radicals are minimal (don’t contain any of the radicals of other formula_33&#x27;s) is uniquely determined by formula_27; this intersection is then called the unmixed part of formula_27. It is also a closure operation.

Given ideals formula_36 in a ring formula_1, the ideal
:formula_38
is called the saturation of formula_27 with respect to formula_40 and is a closure operation (this notion is closely related to the study of local cohomology).

See also tight closure.

== Reduction theory ==
== Local cohomology in ideal theory ==

Local cohomology can sometimes be used to obtain information on an ideal. This section assumes some familiarity with sheaf theory and scheme theory.

Let formula_41 be a module over a ring formula_42 and formula_27 an ideal. Then formula_41 determines the sheaf formula_45 on formula_46 (the restriction to &quot;Y&quot; of the sheaf associated to &quot;M&quot;). Unwinding the definition, one sees:
:formula_47.
Here, formula_48 is called the ideal transform of formula_41 with respect to formula_27.

<text>The Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) governed the world trade in textiles and garments from 1974 through 1994, imposing s on the amount developing countries could export to developed countries. Its successor, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), expired on 1 January 2005.

==History==
Since the (re)emergence of developing countries as a source of cotton textiles, production from these countries steadily increased after colonial independence. A number of treaties concerning Short-Term Arrangements regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 21 July 1961); Long-Term Arrangement regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 9 February 1962 and 15 June 1970), and Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles (Geneva, 20 December 1973) established trade rules in textiles. Eventually, the Multi Fibre Agreement was established in 1974.

==Impact==
The MFA was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed countries to adjust to imports from the developing world.

At the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round, it was decided to bring the textile trade under the jurisdiction of the World Trade Organization. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provided for the gradual dismantling of the quotas that existed under the MFA. This process was completed on 1 January 2005. However, large tariffs remained in place on many textile products.

Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from China. However, this was not the case. It turns out that even in the face of other economic giants, Bangladesh&#x27;s labor is &quot;cheaper than anywhere else in the world.&quot; While some smaller factories were documented making pay cuts and layoffs, most downsizing was essentially speculative – the orders for goods kept coming even after the MFA expired. In fact, Bangladesh&#x27;s exports increased in value by about $500 million in 2006.

<doc id="1248718" wikidata="Q489418" url="?curid=1248718" title="Solec Kujawski radio transmitter">
<text>The Longwave transmitter Solec Kujawski (; &quot;RCN Solec Kujawski&quot;) is a longwave broadcasting facility of Polskie Radio on a frequency of 225 kHz frequency (wavelength of 1333m). Its construction was necessitated by the collapse of the Warsaw radio mast on 8 August 1991 and the resistance of the local population to its reconstruction. The height above sea level of the station is .

The station was built in 1998–99 on a former military area near Solec Kujawski. The area was originally a hamlet called Kabat (Grosswalde) until World War II, when the Germans established a military artillery and rocket training ground in the area. It has three transmitters manufactured by Thomcast, each of 400 kW, giving a combined power of 1200 kilowatts. In practice it uses 1000 kW. The carrier frequency is, as in the earlier days of the Konstantynow transmitter, generated by a set of twin high-accuracy thermally-stabilized quartz oscillators. It transmits the longwave signal of Polskie Radio Program I at 225 kHz frequency, after changing from 227 kHz in 1988.

It uses a directional aerial, consisting of a high and a high guyed grounded mast 330 metres apart. The taller mast is Poland&#x27;s eighth highest structure.

Furthermore, there is a freestanding lattice tower close to the station building that is used for directional radio links, which serve among others for passing the program to the station.

On 16 May 2017, an engineer was electrocuted and died during maintenance work on the power supply. The transmitter therefore had to remain silent for two more days while a safety review was conducted.

<doc id="1248719" wikidata="Q2353927" url="?curid=1248719" title="Louis Wigfall">
<text>Louis Trezevant Wigfall (April 21, 1816 – February 18, 1874) was an American politician who served as a Confederate States Senator from Texas from 1862 to 1865. He was among a group of leading secessionists known as Fire-Eaters, advocating the preservation and expansion of an aristocratic agricultural society based on slave labor. He briefly served as a Confederate Brigadier General of the Texas Brigade at the outset of the American Civil War before taking his seat in the Confederate Senate. Wigfall&#x27;s reputation for oratory and hard-drinking, along with a combative nature and high-minded sense of personal honor, made him one of the more imposing political figures of his time. He was also an enslaver.

==Early life and career==

===Youth===
Wigfall was born on a plantation near Edgefield, South Carolina, to Levi Durant and Eliza Thomson Wigfall. His father, who died in 1818, was a successful Charleston merchant before moving to Edgefield. His mother was of the French Huguenot Trezavant family. She died when young Louis was 13. An older brother, Hamden, was killed in a duel. Another, Arthur, became a bishop in the Episcopal Church.

Tutored by a guardian until 1834, he then spent a year at Rice Creek Springs School, a military academy near Columbia, South Carolina, for children of elite aristocrats. He then entered the University of Virginia. A perceived insult by another student prompted the first of many dueling challenges he would make, but the affair was resolved peaceably.

In 1836 he entered South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) to complete his studies, but his attendance was erratic. He developed an interest in the law, participated in the Euphradian Society, and wrote epistles on student rights. Most of his time however, was spent at off-campus taverns rather than at his studies. He abandoned academics altogether for three months to fight in the Second Seminole War in Florida, achieving the rank of Lieutenant of volunteers. Despite these distractions he managed to graduate in 1837. A fellow graduate considered to be his closest friend was John Lawrence Manning, who would later become governor of South Carolina.

In 1839 Wigfall returned to Edgefield and took over his brother&#x27;s law practice. Having squandered his inheritance, and with a proclivity for drinking and gambling, he accumulated debts. He borrowed from friends to maintain a freewheeling lifestyle, including from his future bride. &quot;Mere office business&quot; as an upcountry lawyer did not suit his temperament and sense of purpose, nor prove to be as profitable as he had hoped.

===Personal life===
In 1841 Wigfall married his second cousin, Charlotte Maria Cross, daughter of the prominent Charlestown lawyer and former South Carolina State Controller, Col. George Warren Cross, and his wife, Frances Maria Halsey. They had three daughters: Francis Halsey, Louise Sophie, and Mary Frances (Fanny) Wigfall. Louise was a Civil War diarist.

===Violence and politics===
In the South Carolina gubernatorial election of 1840, Wigfall actively supported the candidacy of John Peter Richardson over the more radical James Henry Hammond, which led to public exchanges of arguments and insults. In a five-month period, Wigfall managed to get into a fistfight, two duels, three near-duels, and was charged, but not indicted, for killing a man. This outbreak of political violence culminated in 1840 on an island in the Savannah River near Augusta, Georgia, where Wigfall took a bullet through both thighs while dueling with future Congressman Preston Brooks. Although Hammond lost the race for Governor, he attempted to mediate the dispute between the two hot-headed young men. Wigfall received an aide-de-camp and Lieutenant Colonelcy on Governor Richardson&#x27;s staff, but never was completely satisfied with the outcome of the Brooks affair.

This initial foray into politics and the Brooks affair destroyed his law practice. He was elected delegate to the South Carolina Democratic convention in 1844, but his violent temperament and behind-the-scenes meddling had already doomed his youthful political ambitions. He piled up medical bills because of a sickly infant son who eventually died. Sheriff sales followed, swallowing up his Edgefield estate. A Texas cousin, former South Carolina governor James Hamilton, Jr., arranged a fresh start with a law partnership.

Wigfall&#x27;s reputation as a duelist, often exaggerated, followed him his entire life, even though he gave up the practice entirely after his marriage. However, he would continue to claim the code duello was an important &quot;factor in the improvement of both the morals and manners of the community.&quot;

===Gone to Texas===
Arriving in Texas in 1848, Wigfall joined William B. Ochiltree&#x27;s law practice at Nacogdoches, Texas, then settled in Marshall, Texas. He quickly dove back into politics, serving in the Texas House of Representatives from 1849 to 1850, and in the Texas Senate from 1857 to 1860. He became a staunch political opponent of Sam Houston. When Houston ran for governor in 1857, Wigfall followed him on the campaign trail, attacking his congressional record at each of Houston&#x27;s stops, and accused Houston of being a traitor to the South. He claimed that Houston had ambitions for a presidential nomination and courted the support of Northern abolitionists.

He organized state Democrats to resist the Know Nothing party, but with their defeat his radical views descended in the estimation of Democratic moderates. John Brown&#x27;s Raid on Harpers Ferry propelled him and his radical views back to prominence in the state.

===United States Senator===
The Texas legislature elected Wigfall to the United States Senate in 1859 as a Democrat to the 36th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Pinckney Henderson. Matthias Ward was appointed to the Senate following Henderson&#x27;s death and served from September 27, 1858, until Wigfall was elected and sworn in on December 5, 1859. Wigfall served until March 23, 1861, when he withdrew. He was expelled from the Senate on July 11, 1861, for support of the rebellion. He also served as a member of the Texas delegation to the Provisional Confederate Congress, which formed the provisional government of the Confederacy, and which selected Jefferson Davis as its president. Wigfall had continued to hold his seat after Texas had seceded on February 1, 1861, and was admitted to the Provisional Confederate Congress on March 2, 1861, exhorting the rightness of the Southern cause and berating his Northern colleagues whether on the floor of the Senate or in Capitol Hill saloons. During this time in Washington, he spied on Federal preparations for the coming conflict, secured weapons for delivery south, and upon expulsion by his fellow Senators, he went to Baltimore, Maryland and recruited soldiers for the new Confederacy before traveling to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia.

==American Civil War==

In the days leading up to the start of hostilities, Wigfall advocated an attack on Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens in Florida to prompt Virginia and other upper southern slave states to join the Confederacy. In January 1865, Wigfall stated his reasons for having supported the Confederacy, namely, opposition to African American equality:

He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, as the siege of Fort Sumter commenced. According to diarist Mary Chestnut, he was the only &quot;thoroughly happy person I see.&quot; While serving as an aide to General Beauregard during the bombardment of Fort Sumter, and without authorization, he rowed a skiff out to the island fort and demanded its surrender from Major Robert Anderson. The incident was widely reported in the newspapers furthering his celebrity, but the story redacted the important detail that Wigfall had not spoken to Beauregard in two days. When the authorized emissaries arrived at the fort, they were dismayed upon learning that Wigfall had granted terms to Anderson that Beauregard had already rejected.

===Brigade commander===
With his newfound celebrity Wigfall secured an appointment to full colonel of the 1st Texas Infantry Regiment, and a rapid promotion thereafter to brigadier general of the &quot;Texas Brigade&quot; in the Confederate Army. He took up residence near his encamped troops in a tavern at Dumfries, Virginia, during the winter of 1861–1862, where he would frequently call the men to arms at midnight, imagining a Federal invasion. His nervousness was blamed on his fondness for whiskey and hard cider. He appeared visibly drunk, on and off-duty, in the presence of his men on more than one occasion. He resigned his commission in February 1862 to take a seat in the Confederate Senate, and was replaced by John Bell Hood.

===Confederate States Senator===
At the beginning of the war Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Like political alliances throughout his career, he would first support then split with Davis as the war progressed. Davis supported an increasingly strong national government, while Wigfall, forever an advocate of states rights, moved to block the creation of the Confederate Supreme Court, fearing Davis&#x27; appointments would rule against the states. Wigfall also challenged Davis, a West Point graduate and former United States Secretary of War, on many of his military-related policies, citing his own military experience in the Seminole Wars. Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and frequently proposed legislation on the general&#x27;s behalf. He was also an early proponent of making Robert E. Lee commander of all Confederate armies.

==Later life==
At the conclusion of hostilities, Wigfall escaped back to Texas in the company of Texas troops with a forged parole, then went to London in 1866 as an exile, where he intrigued to foment trouble between Britain and the United States. He bought a mine in Clear Creek, Colorado, returning to the United States in 1870. He lived for a while in Baltimore, Maryland, and was in Galveston, Texas, in January, 1874. He died a month later of &quot;apoplexy&quot; and is buried there in the Episcopal cemetery.

==In popular culture==
In the 1992 alternate history/science fiction novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Senator Wigfall appears as a character. The book uses real quotes of Wigfall.

In the historical novel &quot;The Lincoln Special&quot; by Peg A. Lamphier, Wigfall appears as a major character and villain with some creative dramatization. The novel as a whole is about Kate Warne and the Pinkerton Detective Agency investigating the Baltimore Plot against Lincoln.

<text>The Sunda teal (Anas gibberifrons), also known as the Bebek cokelat or Itik benjut, is a dabbling duck found in open wetlands in Indonesia. The species formerly included the Andaman teal &quot;Anas albogularis&quot; and the grey teal, &quot;Anas gracilis&quot; as subspecies, but is currently considered monotypic.

A molecular phylogentic study published in 2009 that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae found that the Sunda teal is a sister species of the chestnut teal (&quot;Anas castanea&quot;) native to Australia.

This is a mottled brown duck with white and green flashes on its wings. The male and female Sunda teal share the same colouration, in contrast to the related chestnut teal, whose male and female are strikingly different. The nominate Sunda teal has almost identical colouration to the female chestnut teal and can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck, paler face and especially the bulging forehead. The Andaman teal has a variable amount of white on the forehead and around the eyes. The Rennell Island teal looked like a smaller version of the nominate subspecies, with a stubbier bill. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head.

The Sunda teal nests near its favoured freshwater lakes and marshes, usually on the ground, but also in tree holes or rabbit burrows.

This is a vocal duck, especially at night. The male gives a soft &quot;peep&quot;, and the female has a loud quack.

<doc id="1248729" wikidata="Q2907685" url="?curid=1248729" title="Bob Graham Round">
<text>The Bob Graham Round is a fell running (hill running) challenge in the English Lake District. It is named after Bob Graham (1889–1966), a Keswick guest-house owner, who in June 1932 broke the Lakeland Fell record by traversing 42 fells within a 24-hour period. Traversing the 42 fells, starting and finishing at Keswick Moot Hall, involves 66 miles (106 km) with 26,900 feet (8,200 m) of ascent.

The Round was first repeated, in a better time, in 1960 by Alan Heaton. Since then over 2900 individuals have completed the Round with the fastest time being 12hr 23m set by Jack Kuenzle in 2022, surpassing Kílian Jornet&#x27;s record by almost 30 minutes. The women&#x27;s record is 14hr 34m set by Beth Pascall in 2020. The Lakeland 24 Hour record has also been improved with the current holder, Andy Berry, successfully reaching 78 summits in the allotted time.

Along with the Paddy Buckley Round and the Ramsay Round, the Bob Graham Round is one of the classic big three mountain challenges in the United Kingdom. Some fifty-six individuals have completed all three.

==History of the round==
=== Early developments ===
Before the Bob Graham Round, many shorter rounds of the Lakeland fells were developed. These are chronicled in the Bob Graham Club&#x27;s &quot;Story of the Bob Graham Round&quot;, in the fell-walking section of M. J. B. Baddeley&#x27;s Lakeland guidebook, and most recently in Chapter 15 of Steve Chilton&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Hill, Get Over It: Fell Running&#x27;s History and Characters&quot;. 

Some of the more notable rounds:

* 1864: the Reverend J.M. Elliott of Cambridge traversed the summits around the head of Wasdale in 8.5 hours
* 1870: Thomas Watson of Darlington covered with over of ascent in 20 hours
* 1902: S.B. Johnson of Carlisle completed a , round in 22.5 hours
* 1905: Dr Wakefield of Keswick completed the same round in 22h7m (recorded in The Sedberghian)
* 1920: Eustace Thomas, at age 54, covered the same round in 21h25m

Dr Wakefield codified the essentials of the challenge: &quot;To traverse on foot as many tops over 2000ft and return to the starting point within 24 hours&quot;. Wakefield specified the start/finish point as Keswick&#x27;s Moot Hall.

Wakefield also encouraged an attempt in May 1932 by Freddie Spencer Chapman, who completed a route similar to Bob Graham&#x27;s subsequent successful round but finished over the time limit in 25 hours.

=== Bob Graham&#x27;s initial Round ===
On 12–13 June 1932 Bob Graham extended the 24-hour Lakeland peak bagging record to a total of 42 peaks in a time of 23 hours 39 minutes. This was recognised as the new record, despite several tops claimed not reaching in altitude. The approximate distance of the new record (determined using current technology) was with of ascent. At the time the distance was claimed (not by Graham) to be in excess of though the given amount of ascent was close to the currently accepted figure. Several 20th Century sources (including the &quot;42 Peaks&quot; booklet) erroneously state the distance to be .

=== The first repeat ===
In the early 1960s, at a time when the veteran walker Dr Barbara Moore was gaining publicity for doing the John o&#x27;Groats to Land&#x27;s End walk, the Lakeland writer Harry Griffin noted that &quot;You didn&#x27;t need fitness for such walks, you could get fit whilst undertaking the challenge. The Lakeland 24 hour record on the other hand.&quot; As a result, Maurice Collett and Paul Stewart made an attempt starting from Langdale but, experiencing rough weather, completed the round in 27 hours 20 minutes. Also interested were the Heaton brothers from Lancashire who systematically set about attempting the record. After several attempts Alan Heaton finally broke the record in 1960, completing the circuit in 22 hours 18 minutes.

Bob Graham&#x27;s original round included four tops that are not in what is now called the Bob Graham Round. These were:

* High White Stones (an area just to the north of High Raise)
* Hanging Knotts (a subsidiary summit of Bowfell)
* Looking Stead (a prominence on the ridge between Pillar and Black Sail Pass)
* High Snab Bank (a minor prominence on the ridge to the north of Robinson)

Alan Heaton replaced these with:

* White Side
* Helvellyn Lower Man
* Ill Crag
* Broad Crag

It is these along with the other 38 tops that are now called the &quot;Bob Graham Round&quot; and are listed below.

=== Subsequent developments ===
Heaton&#x27;s new record inspired the addition of extra tops with the intent of extending the 24-hour record. As it was soon discovered that the route of Bob Graham&#x27;s round was not optimal for attempts on the absolute fell record, the two are regarded as separate challenges and have slightly different rules. The 24-hour record has now been extended to 78 tops.

The Bob Graham Round is now a standard fell-runner&#x27;s test-piece having been successfully completed by 2,926 people as of the end of 2024. Solo rounds have been accomplished but most contenders are accompanied by at least one runner in support, a requirement for acceptance of membership of the Bob Graham Club. The vast majority of attempts are undertaken close to mid summer to make use of maximum daylight. Nonetheless, as of the end of December 2023, fifty six individuals have successfully completed a winter round of the standard circuit four of whom have done two winter rounds.

== The route ==

The round may be attempted either clockwise or anti-clockwise, provided that the start and finish is at the Moot Hall, Keswick. Predicted times for each stage of the round can be determined using an adaptation of Naismith&#x27;s rule.


==Record circuits==

The succession of fastest rounds by men for the standard 42 tops is:
* 1960: Alan Heaton – 22:18
* 1971: Peter Walkington – 20:43
* 1973: Bill Smith &amp; Boyd Millen – 20:38
* 1976: John North – 19:48
* 1976: Billy Bland – 18:50
* 1977: Mike Nicholson – 17:45
* 1982: Billy Bland – 13:53
* 2018: Kílian Jornet - 12:52
* 2022: Jack Kuenzle - 12:23

The progression of fastest ladies&#x27; rounds is:
* 1977: Jean Dawes - 23:27
* 1978: Anne-Marie Grindley - 21:05
* 1979: Ros Coats - 20:31
* 1988: Helene Diamantides - 20:17
* 1989: Helene Diamantides - 19:11
* 1991: Anne Stentiford - 18:49
* 2012: Nicky Spinks - 18:12
* 2015: Nicky Spinks – 18:06
* 2016: Jasmin Paris - 15:24
* 2020: Beth Pascall - 14:34

The progression of these record times is shown in the graph.

Building on the basic Bob Graham Round, later runners raised the number of peaks traversed within 24 hours still further:

* 1962: Alan Heaton – 54 peaks in 23:48
* 1963: Eric Beard – 56 peaks, involving with of ascent in 23:35
* 1964: Alan Heaton – 60 peaks in 23:34
* 1971: Joss Naylor – 61 peaks in 23:37
* 1972: Joss Naylor – 63 peaks in 23:35
* 1975: Joss Naylor – 72 peaks involving over and of ascent in 23:20
* 1988: Mark McDermott – 76 peaks in 23:26
* 1997: Mark Hartell – 77 peaks in 23:47
* 2020: Kim Collison – 78 peaks in 23:45
* 2023: Andy Berry - 78 peaks in 23:23

The sequence of ladies 24-hour records (for the number of peaks traversed within 24 hours or for the same number of peaks in a faster time) is:
*1977: Jean Dawes – 42 peaks in 23:37
*1978: Anne-Marie Grindley – 42 peaks in 21:05
*1979: Ros Coats – 42 peaks in 20:31
*1979: Anne-Marie Grindley – 58 peaks in 23:20
*1994: Ann Stentiford – 62 peaks in 23:17
*2011: Nicky Spinks – 64 peaks in 23:15
*2020: Carol Morgan - 65 peaks in 23:57
*2021: Nicky Spinks - 65 peaks in 23:45
*2022: Fiona Pascall - 68 peaks in 23:26

The progression of the record for the number of peaks is shown in the graph.

Several later runners have successfully attempted 50 peaks at 50, and 55 peaks at 55. Notable achievements are:
* 1997: Joss Naylor attempted 60 peaks at age 60 over 36 hours (first to last peak) to raise money for Multiple Sclerosis research
* 2005: Yiannis Tridimas completed 60 peaks at age 60, in 23:52
* 2006: Joss Naylor completed 70 peaks at age 70, covering more than 50 miles and ascending more than 25,000 feet, in under 21 hours

=== Double Rounds ===
A double round is two rounds (132 miles and 54,000 feet of climbing) on consecutive days. This has been achieved eight times, three times within 48 hours, with the record held by Dougie Zinis.

* 1977: Boyd Millen - 52:30
* 1979: Roger Baumeister - 46:34
* 1995: Eric Draper - 50:35
* 2016 May 14/15: Nicky Spinks - 45:30
* 2018: Tom Hollins - 52:30
* 2019 August 24/26: Stuart Walker - 51:18
* 2020 August 1/3 Gwynne Stokes - 54:30
* 2021 September 10/11: Dougie Zinis - 45:03

Baumeister and Spinks both started at Keswick, ran clockwise to Yewbarrow (peak 31 on a clockwise Round), reversed and ran back to Keswick, then continued anticlockwise to Yewbarrow (now peak 12 on an anticlockwise Round), before reversing again and completing the double traverse of all 42 peaks, once clockwise and once anticlockwise, at Keswick.

==The Bob Graham Club 24 Hour Club==

The Bob Graham Club was proposed in 1971 by Fred Rogerson. It exists to record attempts at long distance challenges over the Lakeland fells. The majority of the club&#x27;s activity is related to the Bob Graham Round itself. While there is no requirement for those attempting the round to apply for membership most do so. The Club does not organise attempts on the Round, this is left to each individual.

The rules for gaining club membership are simple:

* Starting at the Moot Hall in Keswick, traverse the 42 summits of the Round (or more) on foot and return to the starting point within 24 hours of the starting time.
* The visit to each summit must be witnessed by a companion and the time of that visit recorded.
* The times at each summit and names of companions are entered in the membership application form.

The second requirement effectively prevents solo rounds counting for club membership though several runners, both club members and non-members, have made solo rounds.

The club decided that from 1 January 2020, they will no longer accept rounds that use paid-for or commercial guiding services, in keeping with the ethos of the club of voluntary and mutual support.

<text>Ernst Otto Fischer (; 10 November 1918 – 23 July 2007) was a German chemist who won the Nobel Prize for pioneering work in the area of organometallic chemistry.

==Early life==
He was born in Solln, a borough of Munich. His parents were Karl T. Fischer, Professor of Physics at the Technical University of Munich (TU), and Valentine née Danzer. He graduated in 1937 with &quot;Abitur&quot;. Before the completion of two years&#x27; compulsory military service, the Second World War broke out, and he served in Poland, France, and Russia. During a period of study leave, towards the end of 1941 he began to study chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. Following the end of the War, he was released by the Americans in the autumn of 1945 and resumed his studies.

==Training==
Fischer graduated from TUM in 1949. He then started his doctoral thesis as an assistant to Professor Walter Hieber in the Inorganic Chemistry Institute, His thesis was entitled &quot;The Mechanisms of Carbon Monoxide Reactions of Nickel(II) Salts in the Presence of Dithionites and Sulfoxylates&quot;.

==Research career==
After receiving his doctorate in 1952, he remained at TU. He continued his research on the organometallic chemistry of the transition metal. He almost immediately challenged the structure for ferrocene as postulated by Pauson and Keally. Shortly thereafter, he published the structural data of ferrocene and the new complexes nickelocene and cobaltocene. Near the same time, he focused also on the then baffling chemistry resulting from Hein&#x27;s reactions of chromium(III) chloride with phenylmagnesium bromide. This effort resulted in his isolation of bis(benzene)chromium, foretelling an entirely new class of sandwich complexes.

==Professional advances and recognition==
He was appointed a lecturer at the TU in 1955 and, in 1957, professor and then, in 1959, C4 professor. In 1964 he took the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the TU.

In 1964, he was elected a member of the Mathematics/Natural Science section of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. In 1969 he was appointed a member of the German Academy of Natural Scientists, Leopoldina and in 1972 was given an honorary doctorate by the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy of the University of Munich.

He lectured across the world on metal complexes of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, arenes, olefins, and metal carbonyls. In the 1960s his group discovered a metal alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes, since referred to as Fischer carbenes and Fischer-carbynes. Overall he published about 450 journal articles and he trained many PhD and postdoctoral students, many of whom went on to noteworthy careers. Among his many foreign lectureships, he was Firestone Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1969), visiting professor at the University of Florida (1971), and Arthur D. Little visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1973).

He has received many awards including, in 1973 with Geoffrey Wilkinson, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on organometallic compounds.

==Death==

He died on 23 July 2007 in Munich. At the time of his death, Fischer was the oldest living German Nobel laureate. He was succeeded by Manfred Eigen, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 and is nine years younger than Fischer was.

<text>Devla/Del/Devel, Devlam, Devles, Devleske or Dovel is the word used when directly calling or praying to God in the Romani language.

==Names==
&quot;Devla&quot; basically means &quot;God&quot;. It cannot be confused with the English word Devil, because the word for &quot;Devil&quot; in Romani is &quot;Beng&quot;. Interestingly some villages in India are named &quot;Devla&quot;, as example Devla, India.

These Roma words existed in the 
Roma language centuries before any Roma adopted Christianity or Islam. That is, &quot;Devla or Del&quot; is a common noun meaning &quot;a god&quot;. It is based on the Sanskrit word &quot;deva&quot;, related to the Latin words &quot;deus&quot; (&quot;god&quot;) and &quot;divinus&quot; (&quot;godly, godlike&quot;), Greek &quot;Zeus&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;Dievas&quot; and the name for the sky god &quot;*Dyēus&quot; present throughout Indo-European religions and cultures.

==Devlaism==
After the Yugoslav Wars, some Roma of different groups, like the Arlije and Gurbeti, created their own ethnic religion, based on their folk beliefs of their old Romani folklore, but there are few believers, their holy days are named &quot;Djisatedimi&quot;. Rites like infant baptism (&quot;bona&quot;) and religious male circumcision (&quot;sunet bijav&quot;) maintained from Christianity and Islam and is performed.

<text>Vegard Ulvang (born 10 October 1963) is a retired Norwegian cross-country skier who won three Olympic gold medals, two silver, and one bronze. At the opening ceremony of the 1994 Winter Olympic Games, he took the ceremonial Olympic Oath on part of all the athletes. In addition to his Olympic achievements, he received the Holmenkollen medal in 1991 (shared with Trond Einar Elden, Ernst Vettori, and Jens Weißflog), and won the World Cup in 1990. He has also won nine gold, six silver, and two bronze medals in the Norwegian Championships. He earned nine World Cup race victories. Ulvang also won the 50 km at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 1989, 1991 and 1992.

After retiring from professional skiing, he started his own clothing line.

On 25 May 2006, Ulvang was named chairman of the executive board of the International Ski Federation&#x27;s (FIS) cross-country committee, taking over from Peter Petriček of Slovenia, who decided to step down after four years in the job.

Ulvang was also a part of Norwegian TV 2&#x27;s television travel-series &quot;Gutta på tur&quot;, together with fellow skier Bjørn Dæhlie, TV personality Arne Hjeltnes and chef Arne Brimi. He is also the creator and organizer of the Tour de Ski.

<text>Thai Chinese (also known as Chinese Thais, Sino-Thais) are Chinese descendants in Thailand. Thai Chinese are the largest minority group in the country and the second largest overseas Chinese community in the world with a population of approximately 7–10 million people, accounting for 11–14 percent of the total population of the country as of 2012. It is also one of the oldest and most prominently integrated overseas Chinese communities, with a history dating back to the 1100s. Slightly more than half of the ethnic Chinese population in Thailand trace their ancestry to Chaoshan. This is evidenced by the prevalence of the Teochew dialect among the Chinese community in Thailand as well as other Chinese languages. The term as commonly understood signifies those whose ancestors immigrated to Thailand before 1949.

The Thai Chinese have been deeply ingrained into all elements of Thai society over the past 200 years. The present Thai royal family, the Chakri dynasty, was founded by King Rama I who himself was partly Chinese. His predecessor, King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom, was the son of a Chinese father from Chaoshan. With the successful integration of historic Chinese immigrant communities in Thailand, a significant number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and native Thais. Many of these descendants have assimilated into Thai society and self-identify solely as Thai.

The Thai Chinese are well-established in the middle class and upper classes of Thai society and are well represented at all levels of Thai society. They play a leading role in Thailand&#x27;s business sector and dominate the Thai economy today. In addition, Thai Chinese elites of Thailand have a strong presence in Thailand&#x27;s political scene with most of Thailand&#x27;s former Prime Ministers and the majority of parliament having at least some Chinese ancestry. Thai Chinese elites of Thailand are well represented among Thailand&#x27;s rulers and other sectors.

==Demographics==
Thailand has the largest overseas Chinese community in the world outside Greater China. 11 to 14 percent of Thailand&#x27;s population are considered ethnic Chinese. The Thai linguist Theraphan Luangthongkum claims the share of those having at least partial Chinese ancestry at about 40 percent of the Thai population.

==Official status==
===Etymology===
Thailand&#x27;s longstanding policy was not to regard Thai Chinese as a separate ethnicity, based on the principle of considering all Tai groups living in Thailand as part of the Central Thai people. By endonym, with partial success, now Thai Chinese refer themselves as (, ), however, the term often creates ambiguity among the various Tai groups in the country, especially the Central/Southern Thai who also call themselves the same, these groups Thai Chinese refer as (, ) or (, ).

In cases where details are required, Thai Chinese people refer to themselves as (, ), or sometimes may refer to the ancestral lands as (, ) or (, ), which well known that the Central Thais (Siamese) and Mons were not indigenous to these two provinces but recent internal migration, Bangkok and Chonburi. The term &quot;Krungthepians&quot; still pinned a resentful connotation towards Central Thais, when Krungthep accent is considered as prestige dialect of Central Thai language, while the Central Thai language of Central Thai people is considered an inappropriate language, known as ().

===Identity===
For assimilated second and third generation descendants of Chinese immigrants, it is principally a personal choice whether or not to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese. Nonetheless, nearly all Thai Chinese solely self-identify as Thai, due to their close integration and successful assimilation into Thai society. G. William Skinner observed that the level of assimilation of the descendants of Chinese immigrants in Thailand disproved the &quot;myth about the &#x27;unchanging Chinese&#x27;&quot;, noting that &quot;assimilation is considered complete when the immigrant&#x27;s descendant identifies himself in almost all social situations as a Thai, speaks Thai language habitually and with native fluency, and interacts by choice with Thai more often than with Chinese.&quot; Skinner believed that the assimilation success of the Thai Chinese was a result of the wise policy of the Thai rulers who, since the 17th century, allowed able Chinese tradesmen to advance their ranks into the kingdom&#x27;s nobility. The rapid and successful assimilation of the Thai Chinese has been celebrated by the Chinese descendants themselves, as evident in contemporary literature such as the novel &quot;Letters from Thailand&quot; () by Botan.

Today, the Thai Chinese constitute a significant part of the royalist/nationalist movements. When the then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is Thai Chinese, was ousted from power in 2006, it was Sondhi Limthongkul, another prominent Thai Chinese businessman, who formed and led People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement to protest the successive governments run by Thaksin&#x27;s allies. Mr. Sondhi accused Mr. Thaksin of corruption based on improper business ties between Thaksin&#x27;s corporate empire and the Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Group. The Thai Chinese in and around Bangkok were also the main participants of the months-long political campaign against the government of Ms. Yingluck (Mr. Thaksin&#x27;s sister), between November 2013 and May 2014, the event which culminated in the military takeover in May 2014.

== History ==
===First wave (Before 1767)===
Traders from China began arriving in Ayutthaya by at least the 12th century. In the 1420s, Chinese merchants were involved in the construction of the major Ayutthaya temple Wat Ratchaburana and left several Chinese inscriptions and cultural objects within the temple&#x27;s crypt, including the inscribing of several Chinese family names. According to the &quot;Chronicles of Ayutthaya&quot;, Ekathotsarot (r. 1605–1610) had been &quot;concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,&quot; and was &quot;greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations&quot;.

Following the Qing revocation of the private trade ban in 1684, Chinese immigration to Siam steadily increased, particularly following the massive Southern Chinese famines of the early 18th century. Approximately 20,000 Chinese lived in Siam in the 1730s and were prominent in the city of Ayutthaya and were a prominent faction within the Siamese court by 1767.

===Second wave (1767-1911)===
When King Taksin, himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, ruled Thailand, King Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Chinese settlers came to Siam in large numbers. Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population of Thailand was Chinese.

The early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of men who did not bring women. Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called &quot;Sino-Thai&quot; or &quot;luk-jin&quot; (ลูกจีน) in Thai. These Chinese-Thai intermarriages declined somewhat in the early 20th century, when significant numbers of Chinese women also began immigrating to Thailand.

Economic recession and unemployment forced many men to leave China for Thailand in search of work to seek wealth. If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the &quot;tax farming&quot; system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.

The local Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.

From 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese legally entered Thailand per year, mostly settling in Bangkok and along the coast of the Gulf of Siam. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad labourers and rickshaw pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations, both domestically and internationally. However, republican ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated Chinese schools even before compulsory education was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a Thai language test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai Ministry of Education.

===Third wave (1911-1949)===
Legislation by King Rama VI (1910–1925) that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left Burma between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the Ratchaburi and Kanchanaburi Provinces of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.

The Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s and 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself), which allied itself with the Empire of Japan. The Primary Education Act of 1932 made the Thai language the compulsory medium of education, but as a result of protests from Thai Chinese, by 1939, students were allowed two hours per week of Mandarin instruction. State corporations took over commodities such as rice, tobacco, and petroleum and Chinese businesses found themselves subject to a range of new taxes and controls. By 1970, more than 90 percent of the Chinese ancestry born in Thailand never have Chinese or Taiwanese nationality with Thai only nationality instead. In 1975, diplomatic relations were established with China.

==Culture==
Han Chinese intermarriage with ethnic Thais has resulted in many modern Thais who have claimed distant Chinese ancestry. Thais of Chinese descent are concentrated in the coastal areas of the country, principally Bangkok. Considerable segments of Thailand&#x27;s academic, business, and political elites are of Chinese descent.

The influence of Chinese cuisine on Thai cuisine as a whole has been profound, to the point where there is no longer a clear differentiation between Thai Chinese cuisine and native Thai cuisine. Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: &quot;tom&quot; (boiled dishes), &quot;yam&quot; (spicy salads), &quot;tam&quot; (pounded foods), and &quot;kaeng&quot; (curries). Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from Chinese cuisine. The street food culture of much of Southeast Asia was introduced by Chinese immigrants during the late 19th century. As a result, many Thai street foods are derived from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine. Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the early 1960s, when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the street food culture, and by the 1970s, it had &quot;displaced home-cooking.&quot;

==Language==
Today, nearly all ethnic Chinese in Thailand speak Central Thai exclusively (even in Isan, Northern Thailand and Southern Thailand as well). Only elderly Chinese immigrants still speak their native varieties of Chinese. The rapid and successful assimilation of Thai Chinese has been celebrated in contemporary literature such as &quot;Letters from Thailand&quot; () by a Thai Chinese author Botan.
In the modern Thai language there are many signs of Chinese influence. In the 2000 census, 231,350 people identified themselves as speakers of a variant of Chinese (Teochew, Hakka, Hainanese, Hokkien or Cantonese). The Teochew dialect has served as the language of Bangkok&#x27;s influential Chinese merchants&#x27; circles since the foundation of the city in the 18th century. Although Chinese language schools were closed during the nationalist period before and during the Second World War, the Thai government never tried to suppress Chinese cultural expression. Today, businesses in Yaowarat Road and Charoen Krung Road in Bangkok&#x27;s Samphanthawong District which constitute the city&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; still feature bilingual signs in Chinese and Thai. A number of Chinese words have found their way into the Thai language, especially the names of dishes and foodstuffs, as well as basic numbers (such as those from &quot;three&quot; to &quot;ten&quot;) and terms related to gambling. In Southern Thailand, the difference between Thai Chinese and Peranakans is that Thai Chinese speak Central Thai and are concentrated in Hatyai and Bandon, while Peranakans speak Southern Thai and are concentrated in Phuket province; however, both groups grow up in diglossic environments. Yunnanese speak Mandarin.

The rise of China&#x27;s prominence on the global economic stage has prompted many Thai Chinese business families to see Mandarin as a beneficial asset in partaking in economic links and conducting business between Thailand and mainland China, with some families encouraging their children to learn Mandarin in order to reap the benefits of their ethnic Chinese identity and the increasing role of Mandarin as a prominent language of Overseas Chinese business communities. However, equally there are many Thais, regardless of their ethnic background who study Chinese in order to boost their business and career opportunities, rather than due to reasons of ethnic identity, with some sending their children to newly established Mandarin language schools.

==Trade and industry==
 The Thai Chinese community has played a major role in the development of Thailand&#x27;s economy and national private sector. The early-21st century saw Thais of Chinese ancestry dominate Thai commerce at every level of society. Their economic clout plays a critical role in maintaining the country&#x27;s economic vitality and prosperity. The economic power of the Thai Chinese is far greater than their proportion of the population would suggest. With their powerful economic presence, the Chinese continue to remain a major impetus underpinning the Thailand&#x27;s commercial undertakings and economic activities and virtually make up the country&#x27;s entire wealthy elite. Thailand&#x27;s lack of an indigenous Thai commercial culture led to the private sector being dominated entirely by Thais of Chinese ancestry themselves. Development policies imposed by the Thai government provided business opportunities for the Chinese community, where a distinct Thai Chinese business community has emerged as the country&#x27;s most dominant economic force, controlling the entirety of the country&#x27;s major industry sectors across the Thai economy. The Chinese community has remained active in every sector of Thailand&#x27;s economy such as agriculture (sugar, maize, vegetables, rubber), industrial manufacturing, financial services, real estate, and the retail and whole trading sector. The contemporary Thai business sector is highly dependent on Han Chinese entrepreneurs and investors who control virtually all the country&#x27;s banks and large corporate conglomerates all the way to the smaller retail hawking outlets at the humbler end of the business spectrum with their support and patronage being augmented by the presence of lawmakers and political operatives, where the vast majority of whom are of pure or partial Chinese ancestry themselves. Thais of Chinese ancestry, a disproportionate wealthy, market-dominant minority not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economically advantaged social class: the commercial middle and upper class in contrast to their poorer indigenous Thai majority working and underclass counterparts around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornwell 2000 https://archive.org/details/globalmulticultu0000unse/page/67 67&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Highly publicized profiles of wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs and investors attracted great public interest and were used to illustrate the community&#x27;s strong economic clout. More than 80 percent of the top 40 richest people in Thailand are of pure or partial Chinese ancestry. Of the five billionaires in Thailand in the late-20th century, all of them were of full or at least had partial Han Chinese ancestry. On March 17, 2012, Chaleo Yoovidhya, of humble Chinese origin, passed away while listed on Forbes list of billionaires as 205th in the world and 3rd in the nation, with an estimated net worth of US$5 billion.

Amounting to 10 percent of Thailand&#x27;s population, the Thai Chinese control approximately 85 percent of the nation&#x27;s entire economy. Thai investors of Chinese ancestry control more than 80 percent of public companies listed on the Thai stock exchange. With 80% of Thailand&#x27;s market capital under Chinese hands, many Thai entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry have been at the forefront of the establishing the country&#x27;s most prominent wholesale trading cooperatives owned by traders, merchants, and brokers flush with private equity and venture capital bearing connections to some of Thailand&#x27;s wealthiest business families. 10 Thai business families of Chinese ancestry control half of the all corporate assets in the country. 50 Thai business families of Chinese ancestry dominate the Thai corporate landscape, controlling over approximately 81–90% of the total market capitalization in the country&#x27;s economy.

British East India Company agent John Crawfurd used detailed company records kept on Prince of Wales&#x27;s Island (present-day Penang) from 1815 to 1824 to report specifically on the economic aptitude of the 8,595 Chinese there as compared to others. He used the data to estimate the Chinese — about five-sixths of whom were unmarried men in the prime of life — &quot;as equivalent to an ordinary population of above 37,000, and...to a numerical Malay population of more than 80,000!&quot;. He surmised this and other differences noted as providing, &quot;a very just estimate of the comparative state of civilization among nations, or, which is the same thing, of the respective merits of their different social institutions.&quot; In 1879, the Chinese controlled all of the steam-powered rice mills, most of which were sold by the British. Most of the leading businessmen in Thailand at this point in time were of Chinese ancestry and accounted for a significant portion of the Thai upper class. In 1890, despite British shipping domination in Bangkok, Thais of Chinese ancestry conducted 62 percent of the Thai shipping sector, operating as agents for Western shipping lines as well as their own. The Chinese also dominated the rubber industry, market gardening, sugar production, and fish export sectors. In Bangkok, Thais of Chinese ancestry dominate the entertainment and media industries, being the pioneers of Thailand&#x27;s early publishing houses, newspapers, and film studios. By 1899 in Bangkok, the Chinese owned 18 of the 23 rice mills in the city that produced a capacity of over 100 tons of rice paddies and controlled 56 out of the 66 by 1919.

Thai Chinese moneylenders also wielded considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous Thai peasants, prompting accusations of Chinese bribery of government officials, wars between the Chinese secret societies, and the use of violent tactics to collect taxes. Chinese success served to foster Thai resentment against the Chinese at a time when their community was expanding rapidly. Waves of Han Chinese immigration swept into Siam in the 19th and early-20th centuries, peaking in the 1920s. Whereas Thai Chinese bankers were accused of plunging the Thai peasant into poverty by charging high-interest rates, the reality was that the Thai banking business was highly competitive. Chinese millers and rice traders were blamed for the economic recession that gripped Siam for nearly a decade after 1905. The Chinese then moved into extractive industries such as tin mining, logging and sawmilling, rice milling, as well as the construction of ports and railways that would usher in Thailand&#x27;s modern transportation industry. Though the Chinese were acknowledged for their industriousness, they were nonetheless scorned by many. In the late 19th century, a British official in Siam said that &quot;the Chinese are the Jews of Siam ... by judicious use of their business faculties and their powers of combination, they hold the Siamese in the palm of their hand.&quot; In addition, Chinese millers and rice traders were blamed for an economic recession that gripped Siam for nearly a decade after 1905. Large waves of Han Chinese immigration occurred in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth century, peaking in the 1920s from southern China who was eager to make money and return to their families. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Chinese would lose their control of foreign trade to the European colonial powers and began to act as compradors for Western trading cooperatives. Thais of Chinese ancestry also entered extraction intensive industries such as tin mining, teak-cutting, saw milling, rice-milling, as well as fostered the modernization of the Thai transportation sector through the construction of ports and railways.

By the early 20th century, the resident Chinese community in Bangkok was sizable, amounting to a third of the capital&#x27;s population. Anti-Chinese sentiment was rife. In 1914, the Thai nationalist King Rama VI, published a pamphlet in Thai and English—&quot;The Jews of the East&quot;— employing a pseudonym. In it, he lambasted the Chinese. He described them as &quot;avaricious barbarians who were &#x27;entirely devoid of morals and mercy&#x27;.&quot; He depicted successful Chinese businessmen as reaping their commercial success at the expense of indigenous Thais, prompting some Thai politicians to blame Thai Chinese businessmen for Thailand&#x27;s economic woes. Rama VI also implicitly implied that the distinct ethnicity of the Overseas Chinese and their commanding role of Southeast Asia&#x27;s economy through their commercial businesses have also made them targets of reverse discrimination and resentment by the indigenous Thais and Southeast Asian majorities. King Vajiravudh&#x27;s views were influential among elite Thais and were quickly adopted by ordinary Thais, fueling their suspicion of and hostility against the Chinese minority. The glaring wealth disparity and the abject poverty of the indigenous Thais resulted in them blaming their socioeconomic ills on the Chinese, especially Chinese moneylenders. Beginning in the late-1930s and recommencing in the 1950s, the Thai government dealt with wealth disparities by pursuing a campaign of forced assimilation achieved through property confiscation, forced expropriation, coercive social policies, and anti-Chinese cultural suppression, seeking to eradicate Han consciousness and identity. Thai Chinese became the targets of state discrimination while indigenous Thais were granted economic privileges. The Siamese revolution of 1932 only coagulated the grip of Thai nationalism, culminating in World War II when Thailand&#x27;s Japanese ally was at war with China.

After 1947 coup d&#x27;état, Thailand was an agrarian economy hobbled by state-owned enterprises. Thais of Chinese ancestry provided the impetus for Thailand&#x27;s industrialization, transforming the Thai economy into an export-oriented, trade-based economy with a global reach. Over the next several decades, internationalization and capitalist market-oriented policies led to the dramatic emergence of a massive export-oriented, large-scale manufacturing sector, which in turn catapulted Thailand into joining the Tiger Cub Economies. Virtually all the industrial manufacturing and import-export shipping firms establishments including the auto manufacturing behemoth Siam Motors are Chinese controlled. In the years between World War I and World War II, Thailand&#x27;s major exports, rice, tin, rubber, and timber were under Chinese hands. Despite their small numbers as compared to the indigenous Thai population, the Chinese controlled virtually every line of business, ranging from small retail trade to large industries. Comprising merely ten percent of the population, the Chinese dominated over four-fifths of the country&#x27;s vital rice, tin, rubber, and timber exports, and virtually controlled the country&#x27;s entire wholesale and retail trade. By 1924, Thais of Chinese ancestry controlled one-third of all the sawmills in Bangkok. Market gardening, sugar production (The Chinese introduced the sugar industry to Thailand), and fish exporting was also dominated by the Chinese. Virtually all of the newly minted manufacturing establishments were Chinese controlled. Despite failed Thai affirmative action-based policies in the 1930s to economically redestribute the nation&#x27;s wealth to empower the impoverished indigenous Thai majority, 70 percent of retailing outlets and 80 to 90 percent of rice mills remained Chinese-controlled. A survey of Thailand&#x27;s roughly seventy most powerful business groups found that all but three were owned by Thai Chinese. Although Bangkok has its own Chinatown, Chinese economic influence is much more pervasive and subtle throughout the city. With Bangkok&#x27;s Thai Chinese clan associations are prominent throughout the city as the family clans are major property holders and retain ownership of all the non-profit Chinese-operated schools. With Bangkok being the testament that reflected the extent of Chinese influence on Thailand&#x27;s economic life, virtually all of Bangkok&#x27;s business elites are of pure Han Chinese or at least of partial Han Chinese ancestry. Thai entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry who control much of Thai industry, are seen as a wellspring of upfront private equity and venture capital that serve as chief financial backers behind Thailand&#x27;s latest investment developments including funding Thailand&#x27;s newest construction projects in addition to financing the country&#x27;s state-of-the-art telecommunications sector, as Thai entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry are the key power players behind Thailand&#x27;s telecommunications industry, being at the forefront of several well-known Thai telecom operators such as the Shinawatra telecommunications group, True Corporation, Jasmine, Ucom, and Samar. Kukrit Pramoj, the aristocratic former prime minister and distant relative of the Thai royal family, once said that most Thais had a Chinese relative &quot;hanging somewhere on their family tree.&quot; By the 1930s, the Thai Chinese minority dominated construction, industrial manufacturing, publishing, shipping, finance, commerce, and every industry in the country, minor, and major. Among the minor industries that they presided were food vending, salt, tobacco, port, and bird&#x27;s nest concessions. Among the major lucrative industries, the Chinese involved in shipping, rice milling, rubber and tin manufacturing, teak logging, and petroleum drilling.

By the late-1950s, Thais of Chinese ancestry comprised 70 percent of Bangkok&#x27;s business owners and senior business managers, and 90 percent of the shares in Thai corporations were said to be held by Thai investors of Chinese ancestry. Ninety percent of Thailand&#x27;s industrial and commercial capital are also held by the Chinese. 90 percent of all investments in the industrial and commercial sector and at least 50 percent of all investments in the banking and financial sectors are controlled by the Chinese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ju 1996 https://archive.org/details/understandingchi0000chuy/page/33 33&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Economic advantages would also persist as Thai rice merchants of Chinese ancestry controlled 80–90 percent of Thailand&#x27;s rice mills, the largest merchant food enterprises in the nation. Of the 25 leading entrepreneurs in the Thai business sector, 23 are of Han Chinese or at least of partial Han Chinese ancestry. Thais of Chinese ancestry also comprise 96 percent of Thailand&#x27;s 70 most powerful business groups. Family firms are extremely common in the Thai business sector as they are passed down from one generation to the next. 90 percent of Thailand&#x27;s industrial manufacturing sector and 50 percent of Thailand&#x27;s service sector are controlled by the Chinese.&lt; According to a &quot;Financial Statistics of the 500 Largest Public Companies in Asia Controlled by Overseas Chinese in 1994&quot; chart released by Singaporean geographer Dr. Henry Yeung of the National University of Singapore, 39 companies were concentrated in Thailand with a market capitalization of US$35 billion and total assets of US$95 billion. Four prominent Thai business families of Chinese ancestry which are the Sophonpanich, Lamsam, Ratanarak, and Tejapaibul families respectively control Thailand&#x27;s largest private banks: Bangkok Bank (the largest and most profitable in Southeast Asia), Thai Farmers Bank, and the Bank of Ayudhya. Thais of Chinese ancestry not dominate Thailand&#x27;s big banking sector, but also the small banking sector presided by a number of Thai business families as well. As there weren&#x27;t that many alternative sources of capital prior to the establishment of the Thai Stock Exchange for up-and-coming Thai entrepreneurs of Chinese descent to draw upon, Chinese-owned Thai banks wielded enormous economic power in the Thai private business sector throughout the 1960s to the 1980s. Of the 20 Thai banks that were founded in the years between 1930 and 1950, the Thai Chinese were behind the establishment of 14 of them while the remaining 6 banks were established by the Thai Crown Property Bureau. Thai businessmen and investors of Chinese ancestry are influential in the country&#x27;s real estate, agriculture, banking, and finance, and the wholesale trading industries. In Central Siam, Thai businessmen and investors of Chinese ancestry control the entirety of the area&#x27;s residential and commercial real estate and raw land. The Thai Chinese (mainly of Yunnanese origin) also taken over Chiangmai&#x27;s lucrative gem industry and ended up owning much of the city&#x27;s fruit orchards, restaurants, and retail shops while profiting handsomely off of the city&#x27;s land boom that occurred throughout the late 1980s. During the 1980s, Thai Chinese business groups dominated 37 of the top 100 corporations in the country, with much of the wealth being centralized within the hands of five Teochew business families. In the 1990s, among the top ten Thai businesses in terms of sales, nine of them were Chinese-owned with only Siam Cement being the sole firm that was under the ownership of a non-Chinese. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, structural reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Indonesia and Thailand led to the loss of many monopolistic positions long held by the Thai Chinese business elite. In spite of the financial and economic downturn, Thais of Chinese ancestry were still estimated to own 65 percent of the total banking assets, 60 percent of the national trade, 90 percent of all local investments in the commercial sector, 90 percent of all local investments in the manufacturing sector, and 50 percent of all local investments in the banking and financial services sector.

In the urban center of Chiang Saen, a prominent Thai city situated across from Ton Pheung District in the northern part of Laos, the area served as a diverse economic hub for commercial trade among a multitude of merchants hailing from different ethnic backgrounds, engaging in frontier trading activities. During the era of French colonization, Chiang Saen evolved into a crucial focal point through which the French exerted control over commercial transactions along the Mekong River and assumed authoritative control over the land trade pathways connecting Xishuangbanna, Luang Prabang, and the commercial centers of northern Siam. The French utilized Chiang Saen to advance their economic, cultural, and political interests across borders, often in competition with the British, who operated from the Burmese side of the border. British goods dominated markets in Chiang Mai, Kengtung, and Xishuangbanna, while the French played a significant role in the teak, rice, and opium trade, at times collaborating with ethnic-based trading groups in the region. With the decline of European colonial influence, regional trade, particularly in the nearby highlands, fell largely under the control of the Yunnanese. Due to the relaxation of emigration restrictions influenced by economic reform and the implementation of open-border policies by China and Southeast Asian countries, there has been a significant transformation in Chinese out-migration patterns as a result of noticeable decrease in barriers to emigration. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in mainland Chinese migrants relocating to developing nations in Southeast Asia, particularly to Thailand during the 1990s and 2000s. Many of these Chinese immigrants include petty traders, financial middlemen, investors, owners of small to medium-sized enterprises in the formal business sector, shipping agents (some of which have Thai partners), smaller import-export agents, as well as independent traders and intermediaries associated with Chinese enterprises.

For a select few Chinese entrepreneurs, a number of them have ventured into Thailand to explore potential investment prospects in a market that remains largely untapped amidst the intensifying commercial competition back in China. Certain Chinese real estate investors opt to acquire properties, particularly modern townhouses and structures located along the riverside and in market areas. The rationale behind these property investments has varied, as some investors seek to utilize them for personal residential use, while others strive to establish a lasting commercial real estate foothold in the Chiang Saen area for overseas investment purposes. Entrepreneurs operating within the private sector of Chiang Saen vastly outnumber investors, with shipping agents being a prominent group, boasting at least ten registered enterprises situated along the banks of the Chiang Saen river. Many of these entrepreneurs share a common ethnic background, having commenced their business endeavors as small-scale operators whose initial calculated speculations yielded significant dividends within a burgeoning marketplace. This trend was especially pronounced among Chinese merchants who ventured into small-scale agricultural enterprises, such as the trading of longans, durians, mangosteens, oranges, and apples. In addition to those in the shipping industry, some of the original traders have progressed to become wholesalers, operating warehouses along the river to facilitate the distribution of goods to Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. Within the town of Chiang Saen, small-scale entrepreneurs often specialize in the trade of agricultural products through import and export, as a significant number of these entrepreneurs were previously successful traders back in China, but relocated to the border region due to increased competition within their native market. Petty Chinese merchants operating within the town&#x27;s premises also engage in the sale of imported Chinese fruits and everyday items to both local residents and tourists exploring Chiang Saen. The high saturation of Chinese merchants operating within this sector has fostered a fiercely competitive atmosphere, albeit they are overshadowed by stiff competition from petty Chinese traders offering Chinese goods in the border markets of northern Laos and northern Vietnam, as well as in urban Cambodia.

With the rise of China as a global economic power, Thai businesses under Chinese hands are now at the forefront of opening up the country&#x27;s economy for foreign direct investment from mainland China and Thai businesses that are Chinese-owned are now the largest sources of investors in mainland China among all overseas Chinese communities worldwide. The influx of Thai Chinese investment capital into mainland China has led to a resurgence of Han Chinese cultural pride among the Thai Chinese community while concurrently pursuing new business and investment opportunities while bringing their influx of foreign capital to create new jobs and economic niches on the mainland. Many Thais of Chinese ancestry have begun to rekindle with their long-lost Han ancestral roots, have sent their children to newly established Chinese language schools, visited China in record numbers, invested money in the mainland Chinese economy, and assumed Chinese surnames alongside their Thai names. The Charoen Pokphand (CP Group), a prominent Chinese-owned Thai conglomerate claiming $9 billion in assets with US$25 billion in annual sales founded by the Chearavanonts, a prominent Thai business family of Chinese ancestry which is one of the most powerful conglomerate companies investing in mainland China today. The conglomerate company is currently the single largest foreign investor in China with over US$1 billion invested with hundreds of businesses across a multivarieted range of industries traversing from agricultural food products, aquaculture, retail, hospitality, and industrial manufacturing while employing more than 150,000 people in mainland China. The company is known in China under well-known household names such as the &quot;Chia Tai Group&quot; and &quot;Zheng Da Ji Tuan&quot;.

Reignwood Pine Valley, CP also controls Telecom Asia, a prominent telecommunications and mobile phone manufacturing company in a joint venture with British Telecom since making its foray into the Thai telecommunications industry. Mainland China&#x27;s most exclusive golf and country clubs, were established and owned by a Thai business tycoon of Chinese ancestry, Chanchai Rouyrungruen (operator of Red Bull drink business in China). It is cited as the most popular golf course in Asia. In 2008, Chanchai became the first owner of a business jet in mainland China. Anand&#x27;s Saha-Union, Thailand&#x27;s leading industrial group, have so far invested over US$1.5 billion in China, and is operating more than 11 power plants in three of China&#x27;s provinces. With over other 30 businesses in China, the company employs approximately 7000 Chinese workers.

According to Thai historian, Dr. Wasana Wongsurawat, the Thai political elite has remained in power by employing a simple two-part strategy: first, secure the economic base by cultivating the support of the Thai business elites of Chinese ancestry; second, align with the dominant global geopolitical power of the day. , increasingly, that power is China. As the Chinese economic might grew, the indigenous Thai hill tribes and aborigines were gradually driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the rural outskirts of major Thai cities or into the mountains. The increased economic clout wielded by Thai Chinese has triggered distrust, resentment, and Anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer working and underclass indigenous Thai majority, many of whom engage in rural agrarian rice peasantry in stark socioeconomic contrast to their modern, wealthier, and cosmopolitan middle and upper class Chinese counterparts.

== Religion ==

First-generation Chinese immigrants were followers of Mahayana Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism. Theravada Buddhism has since become the religion of many ethnic Chinese in Thailand, especially among assimilated Chinese. Many Chinese in Thailand commonly combine certain practices of Chinese folk religion with Theravada Buddhism due to the openness and tolerance of Buddhism. Major Chinese festivals such as Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival and Qingming are widely celebrated, especially in Bangkok, Phuket, and other parts of Thailand where there are large Chinese populations. There are several prominent Buddhist monks with Chinese ancestry like the well-known Buddhist reformer, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and the former abbot of Wat Saket, Somdet Kiaw.

The Peranakans in Phuket are noted for their nine-day vegetarian festival between September and October. During the festival period, devotees will abstain from meat and the Chinese mediums will perform mortification of the flesh to exhibit the power of the Deities, and the rites and rituals seen are devoted to the veneration of various Deities. Such idiosyncratic traditions were developed during the 19th century in Phuket by the local Chinese with influences from Thai culture.

In the north, there is a small minority of Chinese Muslims known as Chin Ho. They are mainly the descendants of Hui people migrated from Yunnan, China. There are seven Chinese mosques in Chiang Mai. The best known is the Ban Ho Mosque.

In addition, Thai Chinese also have some customs that are different from the mainland China, such as not eating beef, especially among elderly who worship Guanyin, etc.

== Dialect groups ==

The vast majority of Thai Chinese belong to various southern Chinese dialect groups. Of these, 56 percent are Teochew (also commonly spelled as Teochiu), 16 percent Hakka and 11 percent Hainanese. The Cantonese and Hokkien each constitute seven percent of the Chinese population and three percent belong to other Chinese dialect groups, as reported in 1994. A large number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between Chinese immigrants and Thais, while there are others who are of predominantly or solely of Chinese descent. People who are of mainly Chinese descent are descendants of immigrants who relocated to Thailand as well as other parts of Nanyang (the Chinese term for Southeast Asia used at the time) in the early to mid-20th century due to famine, poverty and civil war in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong (Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka groups), Hainan (Hainanese), Guangxi (Cantonese group) and Fujian (Hokkien, Hockchew and Henghua groups).

===Teochew===
Traditionally, the Teochews comprise a majority population of coastal provinces like Bangkok, Chonburi and Chachoengsao until the 1950s, in which later it was overwhelmed by Central Thai internal immigrants. Many of Thai military commanders as well as politicians come from Teochew backgrounds, while others were involved in trade. During the reign of King Taksin, some influential Teochew traders were granted certain privileges. These prominent traders were called &quot;royal Chinese&quot; (&quot;Jin-luang&quot; or จีนหลวง in Thai). Prominent Teochew politicians include former prime ministers Phot Phahonyothin, Pridi Banomyong, Chatichai Choonhavan and Banharn Silpa-archa.

===Hakka===
Hakkas are mainly concentrated around Chiang Mai, Nan, Phuket, Chanthaburi as well as some other central western and eastern provinces. The Hakka own many private banks in Thailand, notably Kasikorn Bank and Kiatnakin Bank. Prominent Hakka politicians include former prime ministers Thaksin Shinawatra, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Yingluck Shinawatra, present prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, former deputy prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Sudarat Keyuraphan.

===Hainanese===
Hainanese people is another prominent Thai Chinese group which are mainly concentrated in Bangkok, Samui and some central provinces. Notable Hainanese Thai families include the Chirathivat family of Central Group and the Yoovidhya family of Krating Daeng, while politicians from this dialect group include former prime minister Pote Sarasin and politicians such as Boonchu Rojanastien, Banyat Bantadtan, Jurin Laksanawisit and Sondhi Limthongkul.

===Hokkien===
Hokkiens or Hoklos are a dominant group of Chinese particularly in the south of Thailand, mostly can trace their ancestry from Xiamen; aside from Thais, they also traded with Indians and other foreigners in Thailand. Hokkiens primarily live in Bandon in Surat Thani Province. A smaller Hoklo community can also be found in Hatyai in Songkhla Province and Satun Province. Some Hokkiens live in Bangkok traces their ancestry from Zhangzhou, like Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. Prominent Hokkien politicians include former prime ministers Chuan Leekpai, Anand Panyarachun and Srettha Thavisin.

===Cantonese===
The Cantonese predominantly came from Taishan as well as Xinhui counties in Jiangmen as well as the city of Guangzhou in Guangdong province of China. This group are not very prominent and are mainly concentrated in Bangkok and the central provinces. Although Cantonese from Yulin primarily live in Betong of Yala Province they are more popularly known as Kwongsai in which they are distinguished from the fellow kinsmen from Guangdong province despite sharing the same native dialect (, 廣西; ). Among the prominent Thai Chinese politicians with Cantonese ancestry are Chavarat Charnvirakul, Plaek Phibunsongkram and Anutin Charnvirakul.

===Fuzhou and Fuqing dialects===
This dialect group is the smallest among the ethnic Chinese populace and are found in places such as Chandi located in Nakhon Si Thammarat province as well as in other provinces such as Chumphon (Lamae and Map Ammarit villages) and also Rayong province (in the settlement of Ban Chandi, which was renamed after their main population centre of Chandi in Southern Thailand as a result of internal immigration and resettlement) as well as a lesser extent a pocket of them being internal migrants residing in Bangkok as well as Central Thailand (surrounding provinces of the capital, Bangkok), they trace their ancestries back to Fuzhou and Ningde towns of northern Fujian province, China.

===Peranakan===

Some ethnic Chinese living in the Malay-dominated provinces in the far south use Malay, rather than Thai as a lingua franca, and many have intermarried with local Malays, and are known as Peranakan. They are mostly concentrated in Phuket, Trang and Phang Nga Provinces. In modern sense, Peranakan are not Thai Chinese, because Peranakan speak Southern Thai, while Thai Chinese in Southern Thailand (especially in Hatyai and Bandon) speak a localized accent or variant of Central Thai, known as &quot;Leangkaluang&quot; () which exhibits Southern Thai influences.

== Family names ==
Almost all Thai-Chinese or Sino-Thais, especially those who came to Thailand before the 1950s, only use Thai surname in public, while it was required by Rama VI as a condition of Thai citizenship. The few retaining native Chinese surnames are either recent immigrants or resident aliens. For some immigrants who settled in Southern Thailand before the 1950s, it was common to simply prefix &quot;Sae-&quot; (from Chinese: , &#x27;family name&#x27;) to a transliteration of their name to form the new family name; Wanlop Saechio&#x27;s last name thus derived from the Hainanese and Chanin Sae-ear&#x27;s last name is from Hokkien . &quot;Sae&quot; is also used by Hmong people in Thailand. In 1950s-1970s Chinese immigrants had that surname in Thailand, although Chinese immigrants to Thailand after the 1970s use their Chinese family names without &quot;Sae-&quot; therefore these people didn&#x27;t recognize as Sino-Thais like Thai celebrity, Thassapak Hsu&#x27;s last name is Mandarin&#x27;s surname .

Sino-Thai surnames are often distinct from those of the other-Thai population, with generally longer names mimicking those of high officials and upper-class Thais and with elements of these longer names retaining their original Chinese family name in translation or transliteration. For example, former Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa&#x27;s unusual &quot;Archa&quot; element is a translation into Thai of his family&#x27;s former name Ma ( 馬, 马, &#x27;horse&#x27;). Similarly, the &quot;Lim&quot; in Sondhi Limthongkul&#x27;s and Pita Limjaroenrat&#x27;s name is the pronunciation of the name Lin (林). For an example, see the background of the Vejjajiva Palace name. Note that the latter-day Royal Thai General System of Transcription would transcribe it as &quot;Wetchachiwa&quot; and that the Sanskrit-derived name refers to &#x27;medical profession&#x27;.

<text>The longwave transmitter Raszyn is a longwave broadcasting transmitter near Raszyn, Poland. It was built in 1931 and rebuilt in 1949. The designer of the mast is unknown. It has been claimed that the rebuilt tower consists of sections from the radio mast of former Deutschlandsender Herzberg/Elster; however, there is no proof of this theory. The mast of the Raszyn longwave transmitter was, at inauguration, the second-tallest man-made structure on earth and until 1962, with a height of , the tallest structure in Europe. The tower&#x27;s height is .

The longwave transmitter Raszyn was until the inauguration of Warsaw radio mast in Konstantynów the central longwave broadcasting facility of Poland.

Since 1978 from this facility during daytime a second program in the longwave range was transmitted on AM-LW (long wave)198 kHz/1,515 meters (formerly the frequency was used by ).
After the collapse of Warsaw radio mast in 1991 this facility was used until the inauguration of the new longwave-transmitter Solec Kujawski for transmissions of the first program of the Polish Broadcasting Service on AM-LW (longwave) 225 kHz/1,333 meters. Because it has never been possible to transmit from Raszyn on both longwave frequencies of the Polish Broadcasting Company simultaneously due to its orientation towards the east and risk of interference, no transmissions on the second longwave frequency of the Polish Broadcasting Company (AM-LW 198 kHz/1515 meters) took place between 1991 and 1999.

The radio mast of the longwave transmitter Raszyn is since the collapse of the Warsaw radio mast the sixth tallest structure in Poland. On July 31, 2009, Polish Radio Parlament on has discontinued their broadcast on AM-LW (longwave) due to the Great Recession, and the longwave transmitter has been turned off.

The place was actually used for transmitting purposes from 1931 when the then Polish Radio Co. opened their new, modern 120 kW transmitter that was using two tall guyed steel lattice masts to support a T-shaped antenna. In the late 1930s works started to increase the output power to 600 kW but the works were not completed before start of the World War II. One of the masts was destroyed by Polish Army engineers to prevent the Germans from using the station.

Trivia: for a very short time after opening their new transmitting facility in 1931 the official Polish Radio Co. announcement was &#x27;Halo, tu Polskie Radio Raszyn&#x27; (&#x27;This is the Polish Radio Raszyn&#x27;), but because Polish pronunciation of &#x27;Raszyn&#x27; is nearly identical to English pronunciation of &#x27;Russian&#x27; and therefore was confusing foreign listeners, the announcement was promptly changed back to &#x27;Halo, tu Polskie Radio Warszawa&#x27; (&#x27;This is the Polish Radio Warsaw&#x27;) (source: Maciej Józef Kwiatkowski &#x27;Tu Polskie Radio Warszawa&#x27;, Warsaw 1980).

<text>Patrick Coveney (29 July 1934 – 22 October 2022) was an Irish prelate of the Catholic Church who worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See from 1966 to 2009. He became an archbishop in 1985 and fulfilled several assignments as Apostolic Nuncio, including stints in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, New Zealand, and Greece.

== Early years==
Coveney was born in Tracton, County Cork, Ireland, studied at Maynooth College (obtaining the academic degree of Bachelor of Arts in classical languages and literature), and the Pontifical Irish College, Rome, Italy (obtaining the Licentiate of Sacred Theology), and was ordained, aged twenty-four, as a priest on 21 February 1959 by the archbishop vicegerent (deputy vicar general of Rome) Luigi Traglia in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.

After doing parish work in Kidlington, England, he taught in St. Finbarr&#x27;s College, the minor seminary of the Diocese of Cork and Ross in Cork from 1960 to 1966. When use of the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the Roman Rite Mass, he edited a lectionary in English.

In September 1966 he went to work in the English-language section of the Secretariat of State in the Vatican. This sometimes involved acting as interpreter at audiences of Pope Paul VI, as when this Pope received the three astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission that first landed human beings on the Moon.

At the Pontifical Lateran University he obtained the degree of Doctor of Canon Law in 1969.

==Diplomatic service==
To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1969 and entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1971.

Coveney served with the rank of Secretary in the Apostolic Nunciature in Buenos Aires from 1972 to 1976, returning then to the Secretariat of State in the Vatican. He was counselor of the nunciatures in New Delhi (1982–1984) and Khartoum (1984–1985). 

On 27 July 1985 he was appointed titular Archbishop of Satrianum and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Zimbabwe and Apostolic Delegate to Mozambique. He was ordained to the episcopate on 15 September 1985 in the cathedral of St Mary and St Anne, Cork. The principal consecrator was the Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli; the principal co-consecrators were Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi, Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, and Bishop Michael Murphy, Bishop of Cork and Ross. In Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, he represented the Holy See at the 8th Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (1–6 September 1986).

On 25 January 1990 he was appointed Nuncio to Ethiopia and also became Apostolic Delegate to Djibouti on 26 March 1992 and on 30 September 1995 Nuncio to Eritrea. 

Coveney became Apostolic Nuncio to New Zealand, Tonga, the Marshall Islands, and Samoa, and Apostolic Delegate for Oceania on 27 April 1996. His remit was expanded to include Apostolic Nuncio to Fiji, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Vanuatu on 15 October 1996, and Apostolic Nuncio to Nauru on 7 December 1996. He was also named apostolic nuncio to the Cook Islands and Palau on 14 July 2001. As the longest-serving resident diplomatic representative to New Zealand, Archbishop Coveney served for a time as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. While based in Wellington, he also represented the Holy See at the inauguration of Chen Shui-bian as president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on 18 May 2004.

Coveney&#x27;s last diplomatic appointment was as Apostolic Nuncio to Greece on 25 January 2005. On 5 November 2008, he officiated at the presentation to the Acropolis Museum in Athens of a fragment of the Parthenon Frieze on loan from the Vatican Museums.

Coveney retired in 2009, and died on 22 October 2022, at the age of 88.

<doc id="1248757" wikidata="Q4618125" url="?curid=1248757" title="Mount's Bay">
<text>Mount&#x27;s Bay () is a bay on the English Channel coast of Cornwall, England, stretching from the Lizard Point to Gwennap Head. In the north of the bay, near Marazion, is St Michael&#x27;s Mount; the origin of name of the bay. In summer, it is a generally benign natural harbour. However, in winter, onshore gales present maritime risks, particularly for sailing ships. There are more than 150 known wrecks from the nineteenth century in the area. The eastern side of the bay centred around Marazion and St Michael&#x27;s Mount was designated as a Marine Conservation Zone in January 2016.

==Geography and geology==
Mount&#x27;s Bay is the biggest bay in Cornwall. Its half-moon shape is similar to that of Donegal Bay in Ireland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, although, unlike the aforementioned bays, Mount&#x27;s Bay is relatively sheltered from the prevailing Atlantic westerlies. However, it is a danger to shipping during onshore southerly and south-easterly gales.

The coast is about from Lizard Point to Gwennap Head. Heading north and west from Lizard Point, the serpentine and hornblende schist cliffs reach a maximum height of at Vellan Head and are only broken by small streams and coves such as at Kynance, Gew-grade and Mullion Cove. After Gunwalloe Fishing Cove the cliffs have the softer look of Devonian Meneage Formations of greywacke and mélange, with erosion a problem either side of the naturally dammed ria of Loe Pool. West of Porthleven there are high Devonian slate and granite cliffs to Rinsey Head after which the cliffs are topped by Pleistocene periglacial head and have eroded to form sandy beaches such as those at Praa Sands and Kenneggy. These beaches are in deficit and the cliff line is retreating. With the exception of the harder Devonian dolerite and gabbro of Cudden Point, the low, eroding cliffs and beaches continue to Mousehole. This part of the bay is the most populated with the towns of Penzance and Marazion and the villages of Newlyn and Mousehole. Beyond Mousehole the granite cliffs, rise to 60 m, and are broken by small streams such as at Lamorna Cove and Penberth.

There are small sand dune systems at Church Cove and Poldhu Cove, Porthleven Sands, Praa Sands and from Marazion to Eastern Green, Penzance. The former sand dunes of the Western Green are now covered by Penzance promenade. All, but Marazion to Penzance, are examples of bay dune systems which develop where there is a limited supply of sand trapped within the shelter of two rocky headlands. Church and Poldhu Coves are SSSI and also have associated climbing dunes which occur when sand is blown inland of the main dune system.

Evidence of higher sea-levels in the past can be seen at Marazion where the town is built on a raised beach. A second example is the road between Newlyn and Mousehole. Sea levels rise and fall as the ice sheets advance and retreat, and raised beaches now mark the interglacial periods when sea levels were higher. 

Gwavas Lake is an area of relatively calm water that is situated outside the current harbour area of Newlyn. 

===Post-ice age===
Offshore surveys have found submerged erosional plains and valleys containing deposits of peat, sand and gravel. The deposits indicate cyclical changes from wetland, to coastal forest, to brackish conditions have been occurring over the past 12,000 years as sea levels rose. With the melting of ice-sheets and glaciers after the last ice age, sea levels reached their present levels about 6,000 years ago during what is known as the Flandrian Marine Trangression. Either side of Penzance, on the beaches at Ponsandane and Wherrytown, evidence of a &#x27;submerged forest&#x27; can sometimes be seen at low tide in the form of several partially fossilised tree trunks. Divers and trawlers also find submerged tree trunks across Mount&#x27;s Bay and the forest may have covered a coastal plain 2 to 5 kilometres further south than today. The samples of peat and wood around Penzance have been radiocarbon dated and indicate that the forest was growing from at least 6,000 to around 4,000 years ago when rising sea levels finally killed the trees. Artefacts dating from the Mesolithic (10,000 to 5,000 BCE) have been found indicating some occupation contemporary with the forest. Marshes formed and were overlain by sand, gravel and by sand dunes which formed natural barriers to the sea. Storms sometimes destroyed the barriers depositing sand and gravel over peat beds in Marazion Marsh, and in the foundations of many buildings in Wherrytown and Long Rock. The remains of these natural barriers can still be seen at Eastern Green and the dunes to the seaward of Marazion Marsh. The submerged forest in the intertidal area between Wherrytown and Long Rock is of national importance and is a County Geology Site.

At Loe Pool a barrier dammed the ria of the River Cober causing the formation of Cornwall&#x27;s largest lake. Very little of the Loe Bar shingle is locally derived (compared with nearby Gunwalloe beach material to the south) and the deposits have been tentatively dated as Eocene. The composition of the bar deposits are: chalk flint 86%, quartz 9%, grit 2.6%, greensand chert 2% and serpentine 0.5%. The shingle coming from drowned terraces of the former river that flowed down the English Channel; the nearest onshore source is away in East Devon. Longshore drift is unlikely to have caused the formation because the bar is situated between two headlands but it plays an important part in the maintenance of the bar, with a strong current flowing to the south-east from Porthleven to Gunwalloe, depositing shingle along the bar. The ebb flow is not a simple reverse flow and is not strong enough to remove all the deposits. *

===Marine Conservation Zone===
The Mounts Bay Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) was designated on 29 January 2016 and covers an area of Mount&#x27;s Bay south of the coast from Long Rock to Cudden Point. The site includes the sea around St Michael&#x27;s Mount and tidal reefs such as the Greeb, near Perranuthnoe, and the Long Rock. The MCZ protects habitats ranging from exposed high-energy rock on the coast to sand and muddy sand on the sea floor. The seagrass beds, &quot;Zostera marina&quot;, mainly grow in the sub-tidal zone and are important as a nursery area for fish and shellfish, as well as a feeding area for birds. Damage from the anchors and chains from moored boats can damage the beds.

Animals within the zone include stalked jellyfish such as &quot;Lucernariopsis campanulata&quot; and &quot;Lucernariopsis cruxmelitensis&quot;, and a fish the giant goby (&quot;Gobius cobitis&quot;).

On 19 August 2018, a white harbour porpoise was seen near Mount&#x27;s Bay.

==History==
===Spanish attack===
A Spanish raid took place over two days in August 1595 during the Anglo-Spanish war of 1585–1604. It was conducted by a Spanish naval squadron led by Carlos de Amésquita on patrol from Brittany. They landed, sacked and burned Newlyn, Mousehole, Penzance and Paul. A militia force led by Francis Godolphin was unable to drive the Spanish away.

===Pirate attacks===
In August 1625 &quot;Turks took out of the church of Munigesca in Mount&#x27;s Bay about sixty men, women and children and carried them away captives&quot;. Slavery in the Ottoman Empire and the Barbary slave trade was fundamental to its economy. The Barbary Pirates were then raiding Europe and they took more than a million Europeans off to the slave markets of Tripoli and elsewhere.

===1755 tsunami===
On 1 November 1755, the Lisbon earthquake caused a tsunami to strike the Cornish coast at around 14:00. At Mount&#x27;s Bay the sea rose at great speed and ebbed at the same rate.

==Settlements==

There are several coastal towns and villages dotted around Mount&#x27;s Bay of which the largest is Penzance. To the west are Newlyn, Paul, Mousehole and Lamorna, and to the east are Marazion, Perranuthnoe, Praa Sands, Porthleven and Mullion. The bay also incorporates many beaches, coves and features including Prussia Cove, Loe Pool (and Loe Bar), Church Cove, Poldhu Cove and Kynance Cove.

In the churchyard wall of the church of St. Paul Aurelian in Paul is the 1860 monument to Dolly Pentreath, according to tradition the last native speaker of the Cornish language.

Mount&#x27;s Bay gives its name to Mounts Bay Academy, a secondary school in Heamoor that serves Penzance and the surrounding countryside.

==Industry==
A number of mines were established along the shore and at least three were below the high water mark. An elvan dyke, rich in tin, runs nearly parallel with the Penzance promenade, at about from the shore. According to folklore, numerous veins of nearly pure cassiterite were worked by the ″old men″ in the early 18th-century. Over three summers, from 1778 Thomas Curtis sank a shaft on the Wherrytown reef and then built a 20-foot high wooden tower with a dressed stone breakwater at the base. In 1790, £600 worth of tin was produced by ten men and in 1792, the tin was worth £3000. By 1798, £70,000 worth of the tin was sold. In this year an American ship is said to have demolished the tower and machinery, during a storm and the mine closed. An 1823 attempt at reopening failed as did another in 1836 when a 40-inch cylinder engine was erected on the shore and sold by auction, four years later in 1840.

While not as rich in tin as the Wherrytown reef the Long Rock reef produced tin between 1819 and 1823. A lode containing needle antimony, copper, tin and mundic crosses the reef from east to west, and an argentiferous lead lode ran along the reef from north to south. Sir Arthur Russell, a leading mineralogist and mining historian A. K. Hamilton Jenkin visited the reef in the summer of 1956 and found a roughly circular depression in the rock, surrounded by large blocks of elvan which were intended for the breakwater around the shaft. A line of stones known as ″Parson&#x27;s (Pascoe&#x27;s) Row″ extends to the shore and would have probably supported the timbers of a pier, which would have carried the flat-rods from the onshore engine. A cutting excavated along the length of the lode indicates the removal of part of the lode.
==RFA Mount&#x27;s Bay==
Commissioned by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 2006, &quot;RFA Mount&#x27;s Bay&quot; is the latest-design Landing Ship Dock, the Bay Class used by the Royal Navy. &quot;Mount&#x27;s Bay&quot; has good affiliations with the Sea Cadet Unit &quot;TS Zephyr&quot; in Caterham, Surrey.

<text>The North Island Volcanic Plateau (often called the Central Plateau and occasionally the Waimarino Plateau) is a volcanic plateau covering much of central North Island of New Zealand with volcanoes, lava plateaus, and crater lakes. It contains the Taupō caldera complex, Ōkataina caldera complex and Tongariro Volcanic Centre resulting in it being currently the most frequently active and productive area of silicic volcanism on Earth. New Zealand is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

==Location and description==

The plateau is approximately east–west and the north–south distance is about .

Extensive ignimbrite sheets spread east and west from the Central Taupō Volcanic Zone, centred on the huge active supervolcanic caldera of Lake Taupō, now the largest lake in New Zealand. This last erupted less than 2000 years ago. The volcanic area includes the three active peaks of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe, and Mount Ruapehu in the south, and extends beyond Rotorua in the north reaching almost to the Bay of Plenty coast. North of Tongariro is the volcanic Mount Pihanga. The western boundary of the plateau forms an escarpment beside the Mamaku and Kaimai Ranges, but further south is less distinct. In the east, the plateau runs up to the foot of the Ahimanawa, Kaweka and the fertile Kaimanawa mountain ranges. West of the plateau stands the volcano Taranaki Maunga (in Egmont National Park).

Two of the country&#x27;s longest rivers, the Whanganui and the Waikato have their headwaters on the plateau.

===Geology===
The tallest mountain, Ruapehu, is an andesite cone that was somewhat higher but has been eroded with a cone and ring-plain. It is typical of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre, whose landforms are defined by the intermediate properties of its andesite magma, having a moderate amount of silica, making it more viscous than basalt, but much less viscous than rhyolite. Andesite magma in effusive eruptions cools to form dark grey lava if gas-poor or scoria if gas-rich. The explosive eruptions tend to be small or moderate sized phreatomagmatic eruptions where the hot magma turns water into steam and the magma into ash. Northwest of Ruapehu is Hauhungatahi, the oldest recorded volcano in the south of the plateau. The other two most prominent volcanic mountains are Tongariro and Ngauruhoe, part of a single composite stratovolcano, like Ruapehu, made up of layers of lava and tephra.

The ring plain around the central volcanoes is formed from numerous volcanic deposits from slope failure or eruptions, and lahars or mudflows that occur when either the crater lake water is ejected from Ruapehu during an eruption, or snow melt is released by failure of the crater walls such as failure of an ice dam, separate from an eruptive event. In the case of lahars, they run down the mountain, picking up ash, lapilli, blocks and bombs as well as previously eroded rock, forming a thick, dense mud that is capable of picking up car-sized rocks. An old lahar flow is visible from the approach road to Whakapapa ski field. On Christmas Eve 1953 a sudden lahar at night on Mt Ruapehu knocked out the rail bridge at Tangiwai, causing six carriages of the Wellington–Auckland express to plunge into the Whangaehu River, killing 151 people in New Zealand&#x27;s worst railway disaster.

The percentage of silica is the deciding factor in the thickness or viscosity of the magma and this increases to the north and east of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre, where there is a landscape of calderas and volcanic domes making up the Taupō caldera complex (Central Taupō Volcanic Zone) and Okataina caldera complex (Okataina Volcanic Centre). These produced much of the ignimbrite sheet deposits of the plateau. Ignimbrite is formed from very viscous rhyolite magma which is rich in silicon, potassium, and sodium. It is the gas-rich material ejected from the ground at high speed in an explosive caldera-forming event, creating a giant white hot fountain up to 55 kilometres high. When the ignimbrite falls it flows outwards at high speed (600–900 km/h) and can travel many kilometres, even going up and over hills and mountains before it cools, often trapping air inside. Especially around Lake Taupō the eroded ignimbrite includes pieces of quickly cooled pumice, a lightweight rock that floats on water. The top, unwelded layer of the ignimbrite sheet is relatively soft and easily eroded by streams and rivers, which transport the pumice to the lake. The lower, welded layers of the ignimbrite sheets are more dense, though still porous. These lower compressed layers often show the glint of heated silicon specks. North of the plateau this stone, called Hinuera stone (after a quarry of origin), is produced for use for building cladding. An historic eruption at the north west edge of the plateau at Mangakino about 1 million years ago produced ignimbrite that away in Auckland is up to thick.


The last massive eruption in the area was the Hatepe eruption from the Lake Taupō volcanic complex 1800 years ago, which ejected lava and especially wind-blown tephra over a wide area to the north and northeast of the North Island. About of material was ejected in the space of a few minutes, in what is thought to be New Zealand&#x27;s largest eruption in last 20,000 years, but the entire eruption sequence ejected over in a little longer period which might have lasted several years. As is typical after such degassing events which are separated in considerable time, dome building by effusive eruption of low gas viscous rhyolite magma then occurred resulting in this case the formation of the Horomatangi Reefs about 200 years later. Another example in Lake Taupo of such a volcanic dome is Motutaiko Island and towards the north west of the plateau is the lava dome of Mount Tarawera which was split in half by a later relatively small explosive eruption as recently as 1886 with the greatest loss of human life documented from an eruption in New Zealand history. A subsequent risk assessment suggests the Tarawera containing Okataina caldera complex as the highest risk volcanic field in New Zealand to man.

The plateau is entirely above 200 metres, with much of the part south of Lake Taupō more than 800 metres above sea level. This reflects that the underlying marine sedimentary deposits and subsequent volcanic deposits related to the Taupō Rift have been raised by up to a maximum of during the last 5 million years in the central North Island. Such a process of surface uplift in an extensional regime is believed to be related to the continental nature of the underlying plate.

===Climate===
The plateau has a mild climate although the temperature regularly falls below freezing in winter and snow can fall between March and October. Of all North Island regions, the Volcanic Plateau is closest to having a continental climate. The period of maximum snow is July to September. Sudden blizzard conditions can be experienced on the volcanoes in winter. Such conditions have killed climbers as recently as 2019. The Desert Road on State Highway 1 is often closed by snow in winter for brief periods.

===Flora===

The natural vegetation of the area includes the podocarp conifers including rimu &quot;(Dacrydium cupressinum)&quot;, miro &quot;(Prumnopitys ferruginea)&quot;, matai &quot;(Prumnopitys taxifolia)&quot;, totara &quot;(Podocarpus totara)&quot; and kahikatea &quot;(Dacrycarpus dacrydioides)&quot; and hardwoods that once covered this whole area before the eruption of Taupō and other volcanoes. To the west of the three large volcanoes, the land is rough forested hill country, while the north close to Lake Taupō is more fertile and undulating and much has been cleared for farming. The forest used to extend to the west coast and there are still patches of natural vegetation in wetlands including the Horowhenua floodplains.

However to the south of Taupō the barren, ash-laden soils and harsh alpine climate leave the high land largely bare and unprofitable, capable of growing only scrubby plants. This area is known as the Rangipo Desert although it is not a true desert as the annual rainfall is over 1,000mm PA and the real reason for the low and sparse vegetation was the mass sterilization of seeds caused by the 26,000-year-old Taupō eruption, which swept white-hot ignimbrite through this valley. Prior to this cataclysmic event this area was forested and stumps of charcoalized trees can be seen where soil has eroded.
Around Taupō itself there are geothermal areas with specialised plant life such as the prostrate kanuka &quot;(a subspecies of kunzea ericoides)&quot;.

Further to the east of the plateau lies more rough hill country in the Kaimanawa Ranges, a popular hunting area for wild red and sika deer. The tops of the mountains are open and tussock covered. Helicopters and light aircraft can land on a rough air strip. Hunting range in the bush is often 50 m or less but in the open tops the range can be much further. The area to the south, around Lake Moawhango is richer in plant life. Finally there are areas of beech forest and alpine vegetation at higher elevations throughout the region.

===Fauna===
The northern side of the plateau especially is home to wildlife including birds such as the North Island kōkako wattlebird &quot;(Callaeas wilsoni)&quot;, New Zealand kaka, and large populations of brown kiwi &quot;(Apteryx australis)&quot; and blue duck &quot;(Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos)&quot;. The area to the south of the plateau and down to Wellington is home to a variety of lizards including Whitaker&#x27;s skink &quot;(Cyclodina whitakeri)&quot;, forest gecko &quot;(Hoplodactylus granulatus)&quot; and Wellington green gecko &quot;(Naultinus elegans punctatus)&quot;. Wetlands throughout the region support waterbirds and fish including the endemic brown mudfish.

==Threats and preservation==
The lowland areas are quite highly populated and therefore urban development, agriculture and forestry are a major threat to natural habitats there. One block of lowland forest remains in and around Whanganui National Park and large areas of the uplands are protected either by Maori tradition or in national parks of which Te Urewera is the largest. The four North Island national parks, which surround the plateau, are Te Urewera, Whanganui, Egmont and New Zealand&#x27;s first national park, the World Heritage listed Tongariro National Park. Introduced species and livestock grazing are now major threats to some endemic species. Rats, cats and stoats prey on native reptiles and birds (including the kokako, blue duck and brown kiwi), while imported plants such as old man&#x27;s beard, banana passionfruit and gorse can take over from indigenous species. Finally grazing by goats and possums can eradicate others such as kamahi, kaikawaka (&quot;Libocedrus bidwillii&quot;) and mountain tōtara. Therefore, smaller islands off the coast of Wellington have been used as a refuge for North Island birds and reptiles whose habitats may be threatened now or in the future.

Also the Volcanic Plateau region has the largest area of man made forest in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all the trees are &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; which were bought in for trials at Rotorua in 1899 from Kew Gardens, London. The tree, a native of Monterey, California, grew very fast in the poor soils. Mass planting was initially carried out by prisoners in the 1920s and then by the unemployed on a large scale during the Great Depression. After World War II scientists from Norway settled in the region and helped develop ways of treating the soft pine to prevent rotting using pressure treatment with chemicals. They also introduced selective breeding methods which was the standard way of improving the trees until tissue culture was introduced in the 1990s. Trees take 25–30 years to reach full height. Most plantations use growth factor (GF) trees to guarantee very high quality (straight and knot-free) timber, however treatment by chemical salts is still required to stop rotting. This is done by either dipping or more usually, pressure treatment. New Zealand has pioneered the use of Radiata timber and plywood in small craft boatbuilding. Untreated clear timber or plywood is used that is then encapsulated in epoxy resin after construction. The key reason is the low cost of the wood rather than any inherent properties of the wood which is of moderate weight but fractures easily when bent, when dried to 12% moisture. One of the largest ply factories in New Zealand is located on the Volcanic Plateau at Tokoroa. Although planting by hand is still done on steeper land, most seedlings are now planted with the help of machines.

Urban areas in the region include the towns of Taihape in the south, Ohakune the carrot-growing capital of NZ in the west, and Taupō in the north, with Tūrangi a major trout fishing base at the south of Lake Taupō and by the Kaweka Ranges in the east, The majority of the population of the area lives close to the shores of Lake Taupō, with some smaller settlements to the east of the volcanoes. These make their living largely through tourism, including skiing in the winter season, trout fishing, especially on the Tongariro river or by forestry in the plateau&#x27;s northeast, which includes the Kaingaroa Forest or by working on the extensive hydro electric power system.

==History==
The Māori population during the Archaic period was sparse. Only two moa hunter period sites have been discovered to date. The best known is the Whakamoenga cave near Taupō. The cave was in use about 600 years ago and three moa bones, obsidian flakes, hollow pumice stone ash holders, pumice floats, a fishing net, bird spears, pieces of hue (gourd) and bracken remains have been found. The other moa hunter site is at Tokoroa.

The tangata whenua are the Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Their paramount chief is Sir Tumu te Heuheu. They moved into this area after splitting away from the Arawa tribe on the east coast. The boundary between Arawa and Tuwharetoa is a small island 400 metres north of Huka Falls on the Waikato River. Their main marae is on the southern shores of Lake Taupō at Waihi near the Tokaanu geothermal area. They still retain ownership of the peaks of the mountains which are considered sacred, as well as the Ketetahi hot springs on the north slope of Mt Tongariro. The Māori people considered the volcanoes sacred and in traditional times wore woven flax eye shields to avoid looking at the peaks.

The Rangipo region is largely uninhabited. It is used by the New Zealand Army, based at Waiouru in the south, and by the Rangipo prison farm in the north and Rangipo underground HEP station to the east. During the 1960s the Tongariro Power Scheme redirected the flow of water from many of the streams and rivers that drain the central peaks. The water was channelled into canals, tunnels and storage lakes to provide water for 2 HEP stations at Rangipo and Tokaanu. The water then flowed into Lake Taupō increasing its input by 20%. Most of the Tongariro river flow is not included in the power scheme due to its importance as a breeding area for brown and rainbow trout. The extra water boosted the amount of water available to the 10 other HEP stations on the Waikato River which flows from the north end of the lake and is its only exit.

The productivity of pasture on the plateau was greatly improved in the 1950s once it was realised that the &quot;bush sickness&quot; suffered by local livestock was due to cobalt deficient volcanic soils. The diagnosis and cure for this was discovered by work of New Zealand scientists (Grimmett and Shorland, senior chemists at the Department of Agriculture in 1934) who found that the iron ore which gave the best results contained significant amounts of cobalt, and went against popular wisdom by dosing animals with cobalt, with spectacular results. Australians Underwood and Filmer in 1936 confirmed this and solved a similar issue in cattle in Australia. However the application of cobalt at the rate of 30cc per ha was only possible after World War II making use of war surplus planes and ex WW2 pilots for aerial topdressing. The cobalt was mixed with crushed phosphate rock which was obtained cheaply from Nauru Island in the West Pacific. The resulting mix was called Super Phosphate.

The largest farm - as measured by effective area farmed - in the North Island including 13,800 hectares of land with about 9,500 hectares of developed farm land was established off the Taupō-Napier road and is called Lochinver Station. The station was largely developed by construction millionaire Bill Stephenson and his family using heavy earthmoving equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2015 it was sold to Rimanui Farms after a bid by Chinese interests was blocked by the government. The high country sheep and cattle station has several airstrips, 21 houses and 200 km of roading. It historically carried 100,000 breeding ewes and about 8,000 cattle but now carries about a third of these. It has extensive shelter belts of contorta pine, improved rye-grass pasture and grows crops of swedes and barley. It previously was open to tourist and school group bus tours.

==Popular culture==

Tourism is an economic mainstay of the region with a wide range of largely outdoor attractions from trout fishing, flyfishing on Tongariro River and harling on Lake Taupō, tramping, mountain biking centred on National Park, deer and pig hunting, horse riding to snowskiing/boarding on Mt Ruapehu. The Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, started by mountaineer Graeme Dingle in the 1970s, provides outdoor training experience and skills to secondary school groups and others.

The Raurimu Spiral is a railway spiral traveling upwards in , via tunnels and 180-degree hairpin bends so the passengers near the head of the train can see the rear carriages heading in the opposite direction. At the time of construction it was considered a masterpiece of engineering. This was the last stage to be built in the main trunk railway line completed in 1908.

The Cold Kiwi Motorcycle Rally, advertised as NZ&#x27;s longest running motorcycle rally, has been held on the plateau since 1972. 
The event is run by the Ruapehu Motorcycle Club in early September each year. Bikers sleep in their own tents despite the average temperature being −8 °C at night, but the club provides hot food and drinks, a bonfire, as well as competitions, souvenirs, live bands and toilet facilities.

The one-day Tongariro Alpine Crossing from the Mangatepopo Valley across Mt Ngauruhoe and Mt Tongariro is named one of the greatest one-day walks in the world by the Department of Conservation. The 19.2 km track is well marked in summer and popular, but trampers need to be quite fit and well equipped as the route is exposed, especially during the winter months (April to September), when the route poles are sometimes hidden by snow or blown away. There are two well equipped huts near the ends of route.

<text>The Sydenham River is a river in Grey County in southern Ontario. The river flows north from a source near Williamsford (Williams Lake), drops over the Niagara Escarpment at Inglis Falls and empties into Owen Sound harbour on Georgian Bay. It was named after Lord Sydenham, governor of Canada from 1839 to 1841. The river was formed from pre-glacial river along the Niagara Escarpment.

The river is obstructed by Mill Dam. At this dam is a fish ladder that allows Chinook Salmon and Rainbow Trout to complete their spawning migrations in this river.

==Tributaries and falls==

The Spey River is a tributary of this river that forms south of Inglis Falls.

The 18m tall Inglis Falls is named for settler and miller Peter Inglis.

<doc id="1248781" wikidata="Q896321" url="?curid=1248781" title="Longwave transmitter Europe 1">
<text>The Longwave transmitter Europe 1 was the oldest privately owned radio station in Germany, situated between Felsberg and Berus/Saar, Germany. It transmitted on 183 kHz with a power of 2,000 kilowatts a French speaking programme, Europe 1 toward France. It was the highest power radio broadcasting transmitter in Germany. Longwave transmissions stopped on 31 December 2019.

It was owned by Broadcasting Center Europe (BCE), a subsidiary of RTL Group. In 2020 the last masts were blown up.

==Technical details==
The transmitter used directional aerials of four guyed, insulated radio masts which are 270, 276, 280, and 282 metres (886&#x27;, 905&#x27;, 919&#x27; and 925&#x27;) high.
Furthermore, there is a backup aerial, which consists of two guyed insulated radio masts with a height of 234 metres (768&#x27;).

Due to the strong south-west directional characteristic of the antenna, reception to the northeast of the transmitter (i.e. in the largest part of Germany) is poor or distorted.

The building, in which the transmitters are situated, has a length of 82 metres (270&#x27;), a width of 43 metres (141&#x27;), and a height of 16 metres (52&#x27;).
Its surface area is 2,700 square metres (29,000 sq. ft.) and its volume 31,000 cubic metres (40,000 cu. yd.).
In front of this building, there is a telecommunication tower, which was used for broadcasting the programme of Telesaar.

A new transmitter house with new 2x750 kW transmitter was built in 2015 next to the backup aerial, that was used until the shutdown in 2019.

On the morning of 8 August 2012 an 80 meters (262&#x27;) tall part of the 280 meters (919&#x27;) high transmitter broke down. This was caused by a ragged guy wire. The damaged mast was demolished on 19 November 2012. Mast 1 was demolished on 13 June 2013, because it was useless without mast 2.
==History==
The longwave transmitter traces its existence to the special state of the Saar Protectorate in the 1950s: Occupied by France in 1946, the French military authorities allowed the people to organize elections and govern themselves, becoming a Protectorate using the French Franc as money. It was integrated to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 as a compromise between France and Germany, after the Saar people decided by referendum against a &quot;special European district&quot; status they were proposed. The transmitter was built in 1954, broadcasting since 1 January 1955, on land which is now located inside German borders.
In 1959, one of its main masts was relocated to vertical.

Born in Manchester, the son of the elder Samuel Greg, the creator of Quarry Bank Mill, he was brother to William Rathbone Greg and Robert Hyde Greg. Influenced by the religious beliefs of his mother Hannah, he attended a Unitarian school in Nottingham. Further study in Bristol, under Lant Carpenter, and at the University of Edinburgh was interspersed with experience in the family firm and completed by the, then obligatory, Grand Tour.

Already more interested in the consequences of wealth rather than its creation, in 1830 and 1831 he gave lectures on scientific subjects to the workers at &quot;Quarry Bank&quot;. On his father&#x27;s retirement in 1832, he took over management of Lowerhouse Mill in Bollington, Cheshire and used it as a basis for further social experimentation.

He published his ideas on the model factory village in &quot;Two Letters to Leonard Horner on the Capabilities of the Factory System&quot; (1840) and went on to found a number of educational and social institutions in Bollington. However, in 1847, he introduced new machinery in his mills which was so unpopular that it precipitated a strike.

In consequence, Greg suffered from a nervous breakdown and retired to his Bollington home, &quot;The Mount&quot;. Thereon, he restricted his philanthropy to scientific lectures for the workers of Macclesfield, becoming president of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

Greg wrote the hymn &quot;Stay, Master, stay&quot;, based on the gospel story of the Transfiguration of Jesus.

Greg married Mary Priscilla Needham in 1838 and she had two sons and six daughters with him. He died in Bollington in 1876 after a long illness. His daughter Bertha married Hugh Ronalds, brother and business partner of Dr Edmund Ronalds.

<text>Arena was a British monthly men&#x27;s magazine. The magazine was created in 1986 by Nick Logan, who had founded &quot;The Face&quot; in 1980, to focus on trends in fashion and entertainment. British graphic designer Neville Brody, who had designed &quot;The Face&quot;, designed &quot;Arena&#x27;s&quot; launch appearance.

The headquarters of &quot;Arena&quot; was in London. The magazine was part of Bauer Media and featured articles on food, films, fitness, sex, music, electronics, and books. It was pitched at a similarly upscale audience to &quot;GQ&quot;, attempting to offer a more adult read than lad mags like &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, and gearing itself specifically towards the &quot;black collar worker&quot;.

&quot;Arena&quot; launched the careers of British media professionals such as Dylan Jones, the editor of &quot;GQ UK&quot; who had served as &quot;Arena&quot;″s editor in the late 1980s.

In July 2006, facing competition from the internet, the editorial team behind &quot;Arena&quot; launched a team blog which features regular posts from its contributors. In spite of this, magazine circulation continued to fall and in 2007, Giles Hattersley, chief interviewer at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was brought in as Editor. Hattersley oversaw a revamp of the publication and in November 2007, the magazine relaunched with a new design and new palate of content, featuring David Beckham on its cover. Hattersley returned to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in March 2008 and was replaced in the interim by deputy editor Mat Smith. Smith left in August 2008 to take over as features director at &quot;Esquire UK&quot;.

In April 2009, &quot;Arena&quot; ceased publication. As of April 2009, international editions of Arena outside the UK continued to be published. These editions included Ukraine, Turkey, Korea and Thailand. &quot;Arena Singapore&quot;, the first English language edition outside the UK, was launched on 27 October 2006 by the publishing division of Mediacorp. Two and a half years later, Mediacorp announced on 30 April 2009 that it was closing the Singapore edition of &quot;Arena&quot;.

<text>Eastchurch is a village and civil parish on the Isle of Sheppey, in the English county of Kent, two miles east of Minster. The village website claims the area has &quot;a history steeped in stories of piracy and smugglers&quot;.

==Aviation history==
Eastchurch is styled the &quot;home of British aviation&quot; as Eastchurch airfield saw the first controlled flight by a British pilot on British soil.

The Eastchurch airfield played a significant role in the history of British aviation from 1909 when Frank McClean acquired Stonepits Farm, on the marshes across from Leysdown, converting the land into an airfield for members of the Aero Club of Great Britain.

The Short Brothers, Horace, Eustace and Oswald, built aircraft at Battersea to be tested at the site; later Moore-Brabazon, A. K. Huntington, Charles S. Rolls and Cecil Grace all visited and used the flying club&#x27;s services. Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville came to the Isle of Sheppey to visit the new flying grounds of the Aero Club. In 1909, Moore-Brabazon made the first live cargo flight by fixed-wing aircraft, tying a waste-paper basket to a wing strut of his Shorts-built Wright aircraft. Then, using it as a &quot;cargo hold&quot;, he airlifted one small pig.
The Eastchurch airfield was also the site, in July 1911, of the competition for the Gordon Bennett Trophy for powered air racing, attended by flyers from all over the world and won that year by the American pilot C. T. Weymann. During the Battle of Britain, it was one of the notable bases of the Polish Air Force.

A stained glass window by Karl Parsons in the south side of All Saints&#x27; Church, Eastchurch (built in 1432), was dedicated to Rolls and Grace, who were killed in July and December 1910 respectively. The Memorial to the Home of Aviation was unveiled in 1955, in the centre of the village opposite the church.
In July 2009, Eastchurch celebrated 100 years of aviation history associated with the Island. SkySheppey brought together a number of associations and joined with many visitors to recognise the importance of British aviation history which started in Eastchurch. The organisers, the Eastchurch Parish Council, planned the event for 25 and 26 July 2009. Eastchurch is also home to many forms of aircraft and is where they were originally developed in the early 1900s, notably by Short Brothers.

==Buildings==
The gatehouse is now all that remains of Shurland Hall, connected with many families including the Cheneys who were there in 1274; and Sir John Stanley, who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the 15th century. It was also rumoured to have housed Henry VIII and his wife, Anne Boleyn, for a few nights. For a short period before it was acquired by the Spitalfields Trust in 2006, it was owned by Violet Searle, a business woman who developed an early house within the village in Warden Road. The gatehouse is now in the care of the Spitalfields Trust and in the process of being renovated and restored.


In &quot;Hidden Kent&quot; by Alan Major (Countryside Books, 1994), there is a note from the 1847 gazetteer commenting on the scarcity of fresh water which &quot;makes the inhabitants very careful to preserve such falls from the clouds&quot; and tells of spouts from the church designed to fill large tubs around it in the churchyard.

Royal Navy Shore Station HMS &quot;Pembroke II&quot; was RNAS Eastchurch, Sheppey, Kent. An accounting base, it was operational from June 1913 to 1 April 1918 when it was turned over to the RAF. Also known as HMS &quot;Pembroke 2&quot;, it moved to Chatham as an accounting base from 1940 to 1957. The Shore Station was named after the nearby main base, HMS &quot;Pembroke I&quot; at the royal Dockyard in Chatham.

Eastchurch is also home to three prisons, HMP Elmley, HMP Standford Hill and HMP Swaleside. The prisons complex is known as the Sheppey Prisons Cluster.

== All Saints’ Church ==
All Saints Church is in the centre of the village, it is a large and extravagant church. Currently, the parish is in interregnum as of June 2016, the previous Parish Priest, Rector Chris Shipley, retired. He took the Parish from the Reverend Father Barry Birch SSC, who had been there since October 2008. His predecessor, Father Francis Searle, was the parish priest from September 2000 until his death in 2007. Father Searle was the grandson of Violet Searle.

The church has undergone the &quot;Jubilee Project&quot;, also known as the &quot;tower appeal&quot;. This involved bringing down the bells and restoring them (for the first time in 100 years). The tower itself has been modernised and a new floor and room added. This is now known as the &quot;Jubilee Room&quot; and is funded by sponsors such as the Shurland Hotel.

<doc id="1248810" wikidata="Q3997302" url="?curid=1248810" title="Martyn Bennett">
<text>Martyn Bennett (17 February 1971 – 30 January 2005) was a Canadian-Scottish musician who was influential in the evolution of modern Celtic fusion, a blending of traditional Celtic and modern music. He was a piper, violinist, composer and producer. Diagnosis of serious illness at the age of thirty curtailed his live performances, although he completed a further two albums in the studio. He died from cancer in 2005, fifteen months after the release of his fifth album &quot;Grit&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born Martyn Bennett-Knight in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. His father, Ian Knight, was a Welsh geologist and musician. His mother was Margaret Bennett, a singer and folklorist who was born on Skye. His grandfather, George Bennett, was also an enthusiastic piper. 

Martyn Bennett spent the first five years of his life in the Codroy Valley, where Gaelic and traditional music were parts of the local culture. The family then moved to Quebec. However, his parents separated when he was six and his mother moved back to Scotland, taking him with her. They stayed briefly on Mull, before moving to Kingussie, where he had his first lessons in playing the Great Highland bagpipe from David Taylor, who was also his history teacher. By the age of twelve he was winning junior piping competitions.

==Education==
At the age of fifteen he moved to Edinburgh with his mother. He won a place at the City of Edinburgh Music School, the first traditional musician to do so. During the three years that he studied there he also learned piano and violin. In 1990 he began violin and piano studies at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow, where he met Kirsten Thomson, a piano student in the year above him, who joined him in a band and later became his wife. During the final year of his studies he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, but he recovered after six months of treatment and graduated in 1993.

==Career==
Bennett was influenced by the early 1990s dance music scene and regularly attended clubs. He worked with Martin Swan’s Mouth Music project, combining traditional Gaelic songs and music with contemporary instruments. He made his debut at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 14 January 1994 supporting them. Bennett was a teenager when Swan had first spotted him playing.He took part in the summer festival of the city of Nantes in historic Brittany (France) in July 1994, perhaps his first concert outside the UK.

He released his first album, the eponymous &quot;Martyn Bennett&quot;, in 1995 on Eclectic, a small Edinburgh-based independent label. He had recorded the album in just seven days at Castle Sound studios in Pencaitland. &quot;Floret Silva Undique&quot; uses a poem by Hamish Henderson, who commented &quot;What brave new music&quot;. The album had a &quot;dramatic&quot; impact on Scottish music. He provided the live musical score for David Harrower’s play &quot;Knives in Hens&quot;. He performed at the party held at Stirling Castle for the European premier of the movie &quot;Braveheart&quot; on 3 September 1995. He was back performing in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in January 1996. After writing scores for stage and television, he went on tour to America, supporting Wolfstone. He played at Edinburgh Hogmanay events in 1995 and 1996.

He released &quot;Bothy Culture&quot; in 1998 on the Rykodisc label. One composition &quot;Hallaig&quot; takes its name from the poem by the Gaelic bard Sorley MacLean, incorporating a sample of MacLean reading the poem. &quot;Bothy culture&quot; topped the US college radio charts. The album came close to winning a Mercury Music Prize nomination.

He sported dreadlocks, an image that fitted with the musical and cultural boundaries that he was crossing. At times he was characterised as &quot;the techno piper&quot;. He played at T in the Park in 1998. Scottish celebrities attended his performance at the Buddha Bar in Paris, ahead of Scotland playing Brazil in the opening match of the 1998 World Cup. He was awarded the 1998 Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award in the music category. He played at Celtic connections again in 1999. At Edinburgh&#x27;s Hogmanay celebrations at the millennium, his band Cuillin played at the Castle Esplanade, supporting Texas.

In 1999 he moved to Mull, where he met Dundonian musician Martin Low who helped him with his next work. Rykodisc had now become part of Palm Pictures. In 2000 he released the album &quot;Hardland&quot; on his own Cuillin label. He appeared at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 2000, giving an electrifying performance. A reviewer wrote in &quot;Mojo&quot; that &quot;Scots music has never sounded like this before. No music has ever sounded like this before. Half the audience fled in fear of their lives.&quot; Bennett sold a thousand CDs after the set.

The City of Edinburgh Music School commissioned him to write &quot;Mackay&#x27;s Memoirs&quot; for the school&#x27;s centenary in 1999. It was a piece for chamber orchestra featuring Great Highland bagpipes and harp. &quot;Mackay&#x27;s Memoirs&quot; was played at the celebrations that took place in Princes Street Gardens, alongside the opening of the new Scottish Parliament in July 1999 and at the 2004 Mòd

He was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in November 2000. Over the following eight months he received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the following years his treatments would also include several major operations.

After this diagnosis he recorded his fourth album &quot;Glen Lyon&quot; which was first released on the Foot Stomping&#x27; label in 2002. It was a cycle of Gaelic songs, his mother singing and he accompanying her. Woven into this is a sample of Peter Stewart, his great-great-grandfather singing in 1910, taken from a wax cylinder recording.

He married Kirsten in February 2002. Following a relapse and an unexpected splenectomy in January of that year, Bennett proposed; the ceremony took place in her mother&#x27;s kitchen. The couple moved back to Mull. Illness left him feeling disconnected from his music and one day, in a fit of rage, he destroyed many of his instruments − pipes, fiddles and whistles. Horrified at what he had done, he was unable to bring himself to speak to anyone for the following two days.

The final album that he recorded, &quot;Grit&quot;, was released in October 2003 on Real World Records. It had been recorded while he was ill, and he was unable to play his instruments. He brought together samples of unaccompanied traditional Scottish folk singers, his own bagpipe and fiddle playing, with and electronic drum beats. For &quot;Move&quot;, the opening track, he sampled a recording of traditional singer Sheila Stewart performing the &quot;Moving On Song&quot;, Ewan MacColl’s song about travellers; she was delighted that he was taking it to a new audience. His song &quot;Liberation&quot; featured Michael Marra narrating an English translation of psalm 118. The album has been &quot;credited with starting the musical evolution of Celtic fusion&quot;. On 10 December 2003 BBC Two Scotland aired an &quot;ArtWorks Scotland&quot; documentary titled &quot;Martyn Bennett: Grit&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Bennett died from cancer at the Marie Curie Hospice, Edinburgh on 30 January 2005, aged 33. News of his death spread among those attending the last night of Celtic Connections. The news was held back from the Edinburgh Music School pupils who were recording &quot;Mackay&#x27;s Memoirs&quot; the following day. His funeral was held on Mull.

A memorial concert was held at The Queen&#x27;s Hall, Edinburgh, on 15 April. Around the same time the Martyn Bennett Trust was set up by his family and friends, as a commemorative fund to help young musicians. The 2006 Celtic Connections programme included a Martyn Bennett Day, held on 14 January, with events to celebrate his work. &quot;Toccata for Small Hands&quot;, written by Bennett for Kirsten, was performed in public for the first time. Greg Lawson was commissioned to score an arrangement of &quot;Liberation&quot;. Cuillin Music reformed to perform at the event. After Bennett&#x27;s death, the band preferred to rework material instead of reproducing it. In June 2006, a book &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Time You Have …&quot; was launched which contained recollections of Bennett, compiled by his mother.

On 27 October 2007 an event was held at The Queen&#x27;s Hall. This event was organised by the Martyn Bennett Trust, with musicians invited to workshops during the day, finishing with a concert in the evening.

In 2008 Margaret Bennett released a CD single, &quot;Love and Loss&quot;, with three tracks where Bennett played to accompany his mother&#x27;s singing; two of the tracks were previously unreleased. Mr McFall&#x27;s Chamber, a string quartet from the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, toured with a tribute show &quot;Aye: An Affirmation of Martyn Bennett&quot;, performing pieces that were inspired by Bennett and his work. The tour began in Perth on 18 March and ended on 29 March in Findhorn. A further performance was part of the 2008 Edinburgh International Festival.

In March 2012 an anthology was released on the Long Tale Recordings label, entitled &quot;Aye&quot;. The album consisted of remastered tracks and some new material, compiled by the Martyn Bennett Trust.

In 2013 Creative Scotland announced they would fund an annual prize for new music composition, named in his honour.

A stage show, &quot;Grit: The Martyn Bennett Story&quot;, was created as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games cultural programme. Conceived by Cora Bissett, it was written by Kieran Hurley. Bisset directed the show, having worked in close collaboration with his friends and family to create the show. It premiered at the Tramway in Glasgow in May 2014, then was performed in Mull. It was named event of the year at the 2014 Scots Trad Music Awards. Real World Records label re-released &quot;Grit&quot; to coincide with the stage show.

Greg Lawson, who had been friends with Bennett and who scored &quot;Liberation&quot; for a performance at Celtic Connections in 2006, went on to recreate &quot;Grit&quot; with an orchestral score for live performance. Lawson spent more than a year working on &quot;Nae Regrets&quot;, working out how an orchestra might recreate Bennett&#x27;s precise arrangements.
He assembled eighty musicians to form the Grit orchestra. On 15 January 2015, just over a decade after Bennett&#x27;s death, Lawson conducted the Grit orchestra at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, to perform the Opening Concert at Celtic Connections. The concert was later named as the event of the year at the 2015 Trad awards. A further performance was given on 23 August 2016 at the Edinburgh Playhouse as part of the 2016 Edinburgh International Festival. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Bothy Culture, and the 25th anniversary of the Celtic Connections festival, Lawson and the orchestra, now containing some 100 traditional folk, classical and jazz musicians, performed the show Bothy Culture and Beyond at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow on 27 January 2018.

<text>Lister Mills (otherwise known as Manningham Mills) was the largest silk factory in the world. It is located in the Manningham district of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England and was built by Samuel Cunliffe Lister to replace the original Manningham Mills which had been destroyed by fire in 1871. The mill is a Grade II* listed building, built in the Italianate style of Victorian architecture.

== History ==

On completion in 1873, Lister&#x27;s was the largest textile mill in the north of England. Floor space in the mill amounts to , and its imposing shape remains a dominant feature of the Bradford skyline. The chimney of the mill is high, and can be seen from most areas of Bradford. It cost about £10,000 to build, and its total weight has been estimated at . Samuel Lister called it &quot;Lister&#x27;s Pride&quot;. Until the arrival of electric power in 1934, the mill was driven by steam engines. Every week the boilers consumed 1,000 tons of coal brought in on company rail wagons from the company collieries near Pontefract. Water was also vital in the process and the company had its own supply network including a large covered reservoir on-site (by 2006 that area had become a piazza and underground car park).

At its height, Lister&#x27;s employed 11,000 men, women and children – manufacturing high-quality textiles such as velvet and silk. It supplied of velvet for King George V&#x27;s coronation and in 1976 new velvet curtains for the President Ford White House. During the Second World War Lister&#x27;s produced of real parachute silk, of flame-proof wool, of khaki battledress and of parachute cord.

A strike in 1890–91 at the mill was important in the establishment of the Independent Labour Party which later helped found the modern-day Labour Party.

== Decline and Rebirth ==
The Listers&#x27; business decreased considerably during the 1980s. Stiff foreign competition and changing textile trends such as increased use of artificial fibres were the reasons. In 1999, the mills were closed. Being a prominent structure, the mills attracted a great deal of attention and several regeneration proposals came and went. The sheer size of the buildings being a major difficulty. 

In 2000, property regeneration company Urban Splash bought Lister Mills from the administrators, Ernst and Young, with plans to renovate the silk warehouse. Costs for the project were estimated to be £100 million. Renovation work began in 2003, and construction formally began in September 2004. 131 new homes and 3 ground floor commercial units were subsequently completed in the large buildings. Construction was finished in 2006, but evidently left a majority of the site unmaintained.

The second phase was the regeneration of the largest building on the site, the velvet mill, by replacing the existing roof of the building with a glass and steel structure, housing two storey apartments and creating additional ground floor commercial spaces, whilst preserving original architectural features under the design of David Morley Architects. The new homes went on sale in early 2007.

<text>Algorithmic topology, or computational topology, is a subfield of topology with an overlap with areas of computer science, in particular, computational geometry and computational complexity theory.

A primary concern of algorithmic topology, as its name suggests, is to develop efficient algorithms for solving problems that arise naturally in fields such as computational geometry, graphics, robotics, social science, structural biology, and chemistry, using methods from computable topology.

==Major algorithms by subject area==

===Algorithmic 3-manifold theory===

A large family of algorithms concerning 3-manifolds revolve around normal surface theory, which is a phrase that encompasses several techniques to turn problems in 3-manifold theory into integer linear programming problems.

* &quot;Rubinstein and Thompson&#x27;s 3-sphere recognition algorithm&quot;. This is an algorithm that takes as input a triangulated 3-manifold and determines whether or not the manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. It has exponential run-time in the number of tetrahedral simplexes in the initial 3-manifold, and also an exponential memory profile. Saul Schleimer went on to show the problem lies in the complexity class NP. Furthermore, Raphael Zentner showed that the problem lies in the complexity class coNP, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds. He uses instanton gauge theory, the geometrization theorem of 3-manifolds, and subsequent work of Greg Kuperberg on the complexity of knottedness detection.
* The connect-sum decomposition of 3-manifolds is also implemented in Regina, has exponential run-time and is based on a similar algorithm to the 3-sphere recognition algorithm.
* Determining that the Seifert-Weber 3-manifold contains no incompressible surface has been algorithmically implemented by Burton, Rubinstein and Tillmann and based on normal surface theory.
* The &quot;Manning algorithm&quot; is an algorithm to find hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds whose fundamental group have a solution to the word problem.

At present the JSJ decomposition has not been implemented algorithmically in computer software. Neither has the compression-body decomposition. There are some very popular and successful heuristics, such as SnapPea which has much success computing approximate hyperbolic structures on triangulated 3-manifolds. It is known that the full classification of 3-manifolds can be done algorithmically, in fact, it is known that deciding whether two closed, oriented 3-manifolds given by triangulations (simplicial complexes) are equivalent (homeomorphic) is elementary recursive. This generalizes the result on 3-sphere recognition.

==== Conversion algorithms ====

* SnapPea implements an algorithm to convert a planar knot or link diagram into a cusped triangulation. This algorithm has a roughly linear run-time in the number of crossings in the diagram, and low memory profile. The algorithm is similar to the Wirthinger algorithm for constructing presentations of the fundamental group of link complements given by planar diagrams. Similarly, SnapPea can convert surgery presentations of 3-manifolds into triangulations of the presented 3-manifold.
* D. Thurston and F. Costantino have a procedure to construct a triangulated 4-manifold from a triangulated 3-manifold. Similarly, it can be used to construct surgery presentations of triangulated 3-manifolds, although the procedure is not explicitly written as an algorithm in principle it should have polynomial run-time in the number of tetrahedra of the given 3-manifold triangulation.
* S. Schleimer has an algorithm which produces a triangulated 3-manifold, given input a word (in Dehn twist generators) for the mapping class group of a surface. The 3-manifold is the one that uses the word as the attaching map for a Heegaard splitting of the 3-manifold. The algorithm is based on the concept of a &quot;layered triangulation&quot;.

===Algorithmic knot theory===

Determining whether or not a knot is trivial is known to be in the complexity classes NP as well as co-NP. The problem of determining the genus of a knot in a 3-manifold is NP-complete; however, while NP remains an upper bound on the complexity of determining the genus of a knot in R3 or S3, as of 2006 it was unknown whether the algorithmic problem of determining the genus of a knot in those particular 3-manifolds was still NP-hard.

===Computational homotopy===
* Computational methods for homotopy groups of spheres.
* Computational methods for solving systems of polynomial equations.
* Brown has an algorithm to compute the homotopy groups of spaces that are finite Postnikov complexes, although it is not widely considered implementable.

===Computational homology===

Computation of homology groups of cell complexes reduces to bringing the boundary matrices into Smith normal form. Although this is a completely solved problem algorithmically, there are various technical obstacles to efficient computation for large complexes. There are two central obstacles. Firstly, the basic Smith form algorithm has cubic complexity in the size of the matrix involved since it uses row and column operations which makes it unsuitable for large cell complexes. Secondly, the intermediate matrices which result from the application of the Smith form algorithm get filled-in even if one starts and ends with sparse matrices.

* Efficient and probabilistic Smith normal form algorithms, as found in the LinBox library.
* Simple homotopic reductions for pre-processing homology computations, as in the Perseus software package.
* Algorithms to compute persistent homology of filtered complexes, as in the TDAstats R package.
*In some applications, such as in TDA, it is useful to have representatives of (co)homology classes that are as &quot;small&quot; as possible. This is known as the problem of (co)homology localization. On triangulated manifolds, given a chain representing a homology class, it is in general NP-hard to approximate the minimum-support homologous chain. However, the particular setting of approximating 1-cohomology localization on triangulated 2-manifolds is one of only three known problems whose hardness is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture.

Surrounded by hills and Champagne vineyards, the city is traversed by the river Aube, from which it derives its name.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Baralbins&quot; or &quot;Baralbines&quot; and &quot;Barsuraubois&quot; or &quot;Barsurauboises&quot;.

The commune has been awarded three flowers by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Bar-sur-Aube is located some 30 km west by north-west of Chaumont and 25 km south-east of Brienne-le-Château. Access to the commune is by the D619 road from Ailleville in the north-west which passes through the centre of the commune and the town before continuing east to Lignol-le-Château. The D396 branches off the D619 south-east of the town and goes south to Juvancourt. The D4 goes south-west from the town to Couvignon. The D13 comes from Fontaine in the south and passes through the town before continuing north-east to Colombé-la-Fosse. The D384 goes north to Ville-sur-Terre while the D73 branches off it in the town and goes to Arrentières. in the north. The TER Grand Est Troyes to Chalindrey railway passes through the commune coming from Vendeuvre-sur-Barse to the west to Bricon in the south-east with a station in the town. With a substantial urban area in the west and some forest in the south the commune is mostly farmland. 

The Aube river flows through the commune and the town from south-east to north-west continuing to eventually join the Seine at Marcilly-sur-Seine. The &quot;Bresse&quot; also flows through the commune coming from the north-east and forming a small part of the northern border before joining the Aube at the north-western tip of the commune.

==Toponymy==
The area was attested in the form &quot;castro barro&quot; in the 7th century and &quot;Barri villa&quot; in 932.

&quot;Bar&quot; comes from a Gallic word meaning &quot;summit&quot; and is perhaps even older (pre-Gallic).

Bar-sur-Aube appears as &quot;Bar sur Aube&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

==History==

===Ancient times===
The existence of Bar-sur-Aube goes back to ancient times. There are remains of an oppidum from the Iron Age. A coin with the image of a horse in the name of Togirix (Chief of the Lingones) was discovered on the Sainte Germaine hill.

In Roman times the town appeared on the Tabula Peutingeriana under the name of &quot;Segessera&quot;. Some remains from the 1st to the 4th century including villas have been discovered in the town and surrounding areas. Segessera seemed to have existed from the Roman period to the first Lyonnais in the territory of the Lingones.

The city was devastated by Attila. After the division of the kingdom of Clovis by his son the town became part of Austrasia.

===Middle Ages===
Under Charles the Bald several varieties of coins were issued with the name of the city on the reverse. During the period of the Counts of Champagne the town was of great importance with the Champagne fairs where merchants from Flanders and Italy traded Oriental spices and silk for textiles and raw materials from the north of Europe in mid-February and mid-April. The town was then joined to the crown of France. In 1318 Philip V the Tall sold the town to Jacques de Croÿ, residents bought it themselves to ensure that the king could no longer sell or alienate the lands.

===Modern and contemporary eras===
When Charles V besieged Saint-Dizier the inhabitants of nearby villages came under his protection. The town suffered a long plague in 1636 which led to the end of the fair. In 1862 the fortifications were demolished and the &quot;boulevard du tour&quot; put in their place.

The French Revolution was well received in the commune and the convents disappeared. It became the chief town of the district from 1790 to 1800.

The city and surrounding area was the scene of the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube towards the end of the Napoleonic era on 27 February 1814.

In 1911 the Champagne riots of the Aube winegrowers and the Marnais traders to keep the vineyards in the Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée of &quot;Champagne&quot;.

<doc id="1248846" wikidata="Q5280312" url="?curid=1248846" title="Direct cable connection">
<text>Direct Cable Connection (DCC) is a feature of Microsoft Windows that allows a computer to transfer and share files (or connected printers) with another computer, via a connection using either the serial port, parallel port or the infrared port of each computer. It is well-suited for computers that do not have an Ethernet adapter installed, although DCC in Windows XP can be configured to use one (with a proper crossover cable if no Ethernet hub is used) if available.

The software is available in Windows 9x, Windows 2000 and Windows XP; communication is also possible with Windows NT 4.0 although not under the DCC name. Windows Vista drops support for the Direct Cable Connection feature as Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have become ubiquitous on newer generation computers. To transfer files and settings, Windows Vista includes Windows Easy Transfer, which uses a proprietary USB-to-USB bridge cable known as the Easy Transfer Cable.

==Connection types==
If using the serial ports of the computer, a null modem cable (or a null modem adapter connected to a standard serial cable) must be used to connect each of the two computers to communicate properly. Such connection uses PPP protocol.

If the parallel ports are used, Windows supports standard or basic 4-bit cable (commonly known as LapLink cable), Enhanced Capabilities Port (ECP) cable, or Universal Cable Module (UCM) cable (which was known as DirectParallel cable by Parallel Technologies).

Infrared communication ports, like the ones found on laptop computers (such as IrDA), can also be used.

===USB===
Connecting any two computers using USB requires a special proprietary bridge cable. A directly connected pin-to-pin USB type A cable does not work, as USB does not support such a type of communication. In fact, attempting to do so may even damage the connecting computers, as it will effectively short the two computers&#x27; power supplies together by connecting their 5V and GND lines. This can possibly destroy one or both machines and cause a fire hazard since the two machines may not have exactly the same USB source voltage. Therefore, Direct Cable Connection over USB is not possible; a USB link cable must be used, as seen in the Microsoft knowledge base article 814982. However, with a USB link cable, a program which supports data transfer using that cable must be used. Typically, such a program is supplied with the USB link cable. The DCC wizard or Windows Explorer cannot be used to transfer files over a USB link cable.

====Newer hardware technology with identical functionality====
There are at least 2 known USB-crossover cables capable of bidirectional data-transfer between computers similar to RJ45/Ethernet cables: ProlificUSA.com&#x27;s TE-C0372 High Speed USB 2.0 Host to Host Bridge Cable (PL25A1 Chipset) and ProlificUSA.com&#x27;s TE-C0363 Superspeed USB 3.0 Host to Host Bridge Cable (PL27A1 Chipset), and drivers for these seem to have been included in newer versions of the Linux kernel.

<text>Pinus roxburghii, commonly known as chir pine or longleaf Indian pine, is a species of pine tree native to the Himalayas. It was named after William Roxburgh.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; is a large tree reaching with a trunk diameter of up to , exceptionally . The bark is red-brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, thinner and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles of three, very slender, long, and distinctly yellowish green.

The cones are ovoid conic, long and broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy chestnut-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next year or so, or after being heated by a forest fire, to release the seeds, opening to broad. The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; is closely related to &quot;P. canariensis&quot; (Canary Island pine), &quot;P. brutia&quot; (Turkish pine) and &quot;P. pinaster&quot; (maritime pine), which all share many features with it. It is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range.

=== Chemistry ===
&quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; contains large amounts of taxifolin.

==Distribution and habitat==

The native range extends from Tibet in China and Afghanistan through Pakistan, across northern India (in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal and Bhutan, to Myanmar. It generally occurs at lower altitudes than other pines in the Himalayas, from , occasionally up to . The other Himalayan pines are &quot;P. wallichiana&quot; (blue pine), &quot;P. bhutanica&quot; (Bhutan white pine), &quot;P. armandii&quot; (Chinese white pine), &quot;P. gerardiana&quot; (chilgoza pine), &quot;P. densata&quot; (Sikang pine) and &quot;P. kesiya&quot; (Khasi pine).

==Ecology==
Owing to its shallow roots it is attributed to soil erosion, particularly in the Himalayas. It does not allow any vegetation to grow around it by making soil more acidic through its fallen needles.

Usually, the accumulating carpet of needles on the forest floor under these trees makes conditions unfavourable for many common plants and trees to grow. The most common trees which are able to grow in this environment are &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, banj oak (&quot;Quercus leucotrichophora&quot;) and trees from the family Ericaceae (known locally as &quot;eonr&quot; and &quot;lodar&quot;). This could possibly be due to the relative immunity from fire that the thick bark of these species gives them. The Himalayan nettle (&quot;Girardinia diversifolia&quot;) is another plant which seems to thrive well under this tree.

The caterpillars of the moth &quot;Batrachedra silvatica&quot; are not known from foodplants other than chir pine. The white-bellied heron (&quot;Ardea insignis&quot;), a large critically endangered heron, is known to roost in chir pine.

==Uses==
Chir pine is widely planted for timber in its native area, being one of the most important trees in forestry in northern Pakistan, India and Nepal. For local building purposes, the wood of this tree is the least preferred, as it is the weakest and most prone to decay when compared with other conifers. However, in most low altitude regions, there is no other choice, except for the fact that these being tropical latitudes there are other trees at lower altitudes.

When this species of pine tree reaches a large girth, the bark forms flat patches which can be broken off in chunks . It has a layered structure like plywood, but the individual layers have no grain. The locals use this easily carvable bark to make useful items like lids for vessels. Blacksmiths of that region also use this bark exclusively as the fuel for their furnaces.

Old trees which die from fire or drought, undergo some metamorphosis in their wood due to the crystallization of the resin inside the heart wood. This makes the wood become brightly coloured (various shades from translucent yellow to dark red) and very aromatic with a brittle, glassy feel. This form of wood known as &quot;jhukti&quot; by the locals is very easy to ignite, since it never gets wet or waterlogged. They use it for starting fires and even for lighting, as a small piece of the wood burns for a long time (owing to the high resin content). Of all the conifer species in the area, only &quot;P. roxburghii&quot; seems to be ideal for that purpose.

Every autumn, the dried needles of this tree form a dense carpet on the forest floor, which the locals gather in large bundles to serve as bedding for their cattle, for the year round. The green needles are also used to make tiny hand brooms.

The locals of the Jaunsar-Bawar region of Uttarakhand have several uses for this tree, which is known in the local dialect as &quot;salli&quot;.

It is also occasionally used as an ornamental tree, planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas, where its heat and drought tolerance is valued.

=== Resin ===
It is also tapped commercially for resin. On distillation, the resin yields an essential oil, commonly known as turpentine, and non-volatile rosin. The proportion of rosin and turpentine oil in chir pine is 75% and 22% respectively with 3% losses, etc.

The turpentine is chiefly used as a solvent in pharmaceutical preparations, perfume industry, in manufacture of synthetic pine oil, disinfectants, insecticides and denaturants. It is one of the most important basic raw materials for the synthesis of terpene chemicals which are used in a wide variety of industries such as adhesives, paper and rubber, etc.

Chir pine rosin is principally used in paper, soap, cosmetics, paint, varnish, rubber and polish industries. Besides these, other uses include manufacture of linoleum, explosives, insecticides and disinfectants, as a flux in soldering, in brewing and in mineral beneficiation as a frothing agent.

Presently, India imports resin which is far superior in quality as well as cheaper than the indigenous one. Quality of resin depends on the pinene content. Imported resin contains 75–95% pinenes, whereas chir pine resin contains only about 25% pinenes.

<doc id="1248859" wikidata="Q1332483" url="?curid=1248859" title="Language of Jesus">
<text>There exists a consensus among scholars that Jesus of Nazareth spoke the Aramaic language. Aramaic was the common language of Roman Judaea, and was thus also spoken by Jesus&#x27; disciples. Although according to new findings Hebrew was also a spoken language among Jews in Judea during the 1st century AD. The villages of Nazareth and Capernaum in Galilee, where he spent most of his time, were populated by Aramaic-speaking communities. Jesus probably spoke the Galilean dialect, distinguishable from that which was spoken in Roman-era Jerusalem. Based on the symbolic renaming or nicknaming of some of his apostles, it is also likely that Jesus or at least one of his apostles knew enough Koine Greek to converse with non-Judaeans. It is reasonable to assume that Jesus was well versed in Hebrew for religious purposes, as it is the liturgical language of Judaism.

==Cultural and linguistic background==
Aramaic was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean during and after the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenid empires (722–330 BC) and remained a common language of the region in the first century AD. In spite of the increasing importance of Greek, the use of Aramaic was also expanding, and it would eventually be dominant among Jews both in the Holy Land and elsewhere in the Middle East around 200 AD and would remain so until the Islamic conquests in the seventh century.

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
According to Dead Sea Scrolls archaeologist Yigael Yadin, Aramaic was the language of Hebrews until Simon Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt (132 AD to 135 AD). Yadin noticed the shift from Aramaic to Hebrew in the documents he studied, which had been written during the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt. In his book, &quot;Bar Kokhba: The rediscovery of the legendary hero of the last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome&quot;, Yigael Yadin notes, &quot;It is interesting that the earlier documents are written in Aramaic while the later ones are in Hebrew. Possibly the change was made by a special decree of Bar Kokhba who wanted to restore Hebrew as the official language of the state&quot;.

In another book by Sigalit Ben-Zion, Yadin said: &quot;it seems that this change came as a result of the order that was given by Bar Kokhba, who wanted to revive the Hebrew language and make it the official language of the state.&quot; Yadin points out that Aramaic was the regional lingua franca at the time.

===Josephus===
Hebrew historian Josephus comments on learning Greek in first century Judea:
In the first century AD, the Aramaic language was widespread throughout the Middle East, as is supported by the testimony of Josephus&#x27;s &quot;The Jewish War&quot;.

Josephus chose to inform people from what are now Iran, Iraq, and remote parts of the Arabian Peninsula about the war of the Jews against the Romans through books he wrote &quot;in the language of our country&quot;, prior to translating into Greek for the benefit of the Greeks and Romans:

H. St. J. Thackeray (who translated Josephus&#x27; &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; from Greek into English) also points out, &quot;We learn from the proem that the Greek text was not the first draft of the work. It had been preceded by a narrative written in Aramaic and addressed to &quot;the barbarians in the interior&quot;, who are more precisely defined lower down as the natives of Parthia, Babylonia, and Arabia, the Jewish dispersion in Mesopotamia, and the inhabitants of Adiabene, a principality of which the reigning house, as was proudly remembered, were converts to Judaism (B. i, 3, 6). Of this Aramaic work the Greek is described as a &quot;version&quot; made for the benefit of the subjects of the Roman Empire, i.e. the Graeco-Roman world at large.

In , the &quot;Field of Blood&quot; was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their own language as &quot;Akeldama&quot;, which is the transliteration of the Aramaic words &quot;Haqal Dama&quot;.

Josephus differentiated Hebrew from his language and that of first-century Israel. Josephus refers to Hebrew words as belonging to &quot;the Hebrew tongue&quot; but refers to Aramaic words as belonging to &quot;our tongue&quot; or &quot;our language&quot; or &quot;the language of our country&quot;.

Josephus refers to a Hebrew word with the phrase &quot;the Hebrew tongue&quot;: &quot;But the affairs of the Canaanites were at this time in a flourishing condition, and they expected the Israelites with a great army at the city Bezek, having put the government into the hands of Adonibezek, which name denotes the Lord of Bezek, for Adoni in the Hebrew tongue signifies Lord.&quot;

In this example, Josephus refers to an Aramaic word as belonging to &quot;our language&quot;: &quot;This new-built part of the city was called &#x27;Bezetha,&#x27; in our language, which, if interpreted in the Grecian language, may be called &#x27;the New City.&#x27;&quot;

On several occasions in the New Testament, Aramaic words are called Hebrew. For example, in (KJV), the gospel-writer narrates that Jesus, &quot;bearing his cross[,] went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha.&quot; The last word is, in fact, Aramaic. The word &quot;Golgotha&quot; is a transliteration of an Aramaic word, because &quot;-tha&quot; in &quot;Golgotha&quot; is the Aramaic definite article on a feminine noun in an emphatic state.

==Aramaic phrases in the Greek New Testament==
The Greek New Testament transliterates a few Semitic words. When the text itself refers to the language of such Semitic glosses, it uses words meaning &quot;Hebrew&quot;/&quot;Jewish&quot; (Acts 21:40; 22:2; 26:14: , ) but this term is often applied to unmistakably Aramaic words and phrases; for this reason, it is often interpreted as meaning &quot;the (Aramaic) vernacular of the Jews&quot; in recent translations.

A small minority of scholars believe that most or all of the New Testament was originally written in Aramaic. This theory is known as Aramaic primacy.

In the Gospel of Mark, 5:41:

This verse gives an Aramaic phrase, attributed to Jesus bringing the girl back to life, with a transliteration into Greek, as . A few Greek manuscripts (Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus) of Mark&#x27;s Gospel have this form of the text, but others (Codex Alexandrinus, the text-type known as the Majority Text, and also the Latin Vulgate) write (&quot;koumi&quot;, cumi) instead. The latter is in the Textus Receptus and is the version which appears in the KJV.

The Aramaic is &quot;ṭlīthā qūm&quot;. The word &quot;ṭlīthā&quot; is the feminine form of the word &quot;ṭlē&quot;, meaning &quot;young&quot;. &quot;Qūm&quot; is the Aramaic verb &#x27;to rise, stand, get up&#x27;. In the feminine singular imperative, it was originally &quot;qūmī&quot;. However, there is evidence that in speech, the final &quot;-ī&quot; was dropped so the imperative did not distinguish between masculine and feminine genders. The older manuscripts, therefore, used a Greek spelling that reflected pronunciation, whereas the addition of an &#x27;ι&#x27; was perhaps due to a bookish copyist.

In square script Aramaic, it could be טליתא קומי or טליתא קום.

===Ephphatha (Ἐφφαθά)===

Mark 
: &quot;And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, &quot;Ephphatha,&quot; which is &#x27;be opened&#x27;.&quot;

Once again, the Aramaic word is given with the transliteration, only this time, the word to be transliterated is more complicated. In Greek, the Aramaic is written ἐφφαθά. This could be from the Aramaic &quot;ethpthaḥ&quot;, the passive imperative of the verb &quot;pthaḥ&quot;, &#x27;to open&#x27;, since the &quot;th&quot; could assimilate in western Aramaic. The pharyngeal &quot;ḥ&quot; was often omitted in Greek transcriptions in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) and was also softened in Galilean speech.

In Aramaic, it could be אתפתח or אפתח. This word was adopted as the official motto of Gallaudet University, the United States&#x27; most prominent school for the deaf.

===Abba (Ἀββά[ς])===

Mark 14:36
:&quot;&quot;Abba, Father,&quot; he said, &quot;everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.&quot;&quot;

Galatians 4:6
:&quot;Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot;&quot;

Romans 8:15
:&quot;The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot;&quot;

Abba, an originally Aramaic form borrowed into the Greek Old Testament as a name (2Chr 29:1) [standing for the Hebrew &quot;Abijah&quot; ()], common in Mishnaic Hebrew and still used in Modern Hebrew (written Αββά[ς] in Greek, and &quot;’abbā&quot; in Aramaic), is immediately followed by the Greek equivalent (Πατήρ) with no explicit mention of it being a translation. In Aramaic, it would be אבא.

Note, the name Barabbas is a Hellenization of the Aramaic &quot;Bar Abba&quot; (בר אבא), literally &quot;Son of the Father&quot;.

===Raca (Ρακά)===
Matthew 5:22
:&quot;But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother [without a cause] shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.&quot;

(The bracketed text does not appear in all recensions and is absent in the Latin Vulgate.)

Raca, or &quot;Raka&quot;, in the Aramaic and Hebrew of the Talmud, means empty one, fool, empty head.

In Aramaic, it could be ריקא or ריקה.

===Mammon (Μαμωνάς)===
Gospel of Matthew 6:24
:&quot;No one can serve two masters: for either they will hate the one, and love the other; or else they will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;

Luke 16:9–13
:&quot;And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man&#x27;s, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;

2 Clement 6
:&quot;Now the Lord declares, &quot;No servant can serve two masters.&quot; If we desire, then, to serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for us. &quot;For what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&quot; This world and the next are two enemies. The one urges to adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit; the other bids farewell to these things. We cannot, therefore, be the friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to make sure of the other. Let us reckon that it is better to hate the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those [who are to come,] as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments.&quot; (Roberts-Donaldson)

In Aramaic, it could be ממון (or, in the typical Aramaic &quot;emphatic&quot; state suggested by the Greek ending, ממונא). This is usually considered to be an originally Aramaic word borrowed into Rabbinic Hebrew, but its occurrence in late Biblical Hebrew and, reportedly, in 4th century Punic may indicate that it had a more general &quot;common Semitic background&quot;.

In the New Testament, the word &quot;Mamōnâs&quot; is declined like a Greek word, whereas many of the other Aramaic and Hebrew words are treated as indeclinable foreign words.

===Rabbuni (Ραββουνί)===
:&quot;Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.&quot; (KJV)

Also in Mark 10:51. Hebrew form rabbi used as title of Jesus in Matthew 26:25,49; Mark 9:5, 11:21, 14:45; John 1:38, 1:49, 4:31, 6:25, 9:2, 11:8.

In Aramaic, it would have been רבוני.

===Maranatha (Μαραναθά)===

Didache 10:6 (Prayer after Communion)
:&quot;Let grace come, and let this world pass away. Hosanna to the God (Son) of David! If any one is holy, let him come; if any one is not so, let him repent. Maran-Atha. Amen.&quot; (Roberts-Donaldson)

1 Corinthians 16:22
:&quot;If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.&quot;

Depending on how one selects to split the single Greek expression of the early manuscripts into Aramaic, it could be either מרנא תא (&quot;marana tha&quot;, &quot;Lord, come!&quot;) or מרן אתא (&quot;maran atha&quot;, &quot;Our Lord has come&quot;).

===Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (Ἠλί, Ἠλί, λεμὰ σαβαχθανί)===
This phrase, one of the seven sayings of Jesus on the cross, is given in two versions: in the Gospel of Matthew, it is transliterated in Greek as Ἠλί, Ἠλί, λεμὰ σαβαχθανί; in the Gospel of Mark, it is given as Ἐλωΐ, Ἐλωΐ, λαμὰ σαβαχθανί. The differences between the two are the use, in Mark, of &quot;elōi&quot; rather than &quot;ēli&quot;, and of &quot;lama&quot; rather than &quot;lema&quot;.

Overall, both versions can be said to be in Aramaic, rather than in Hebrew, because of the verb (&quot;šbq&quot;) &quot;abandon&quot;, which exists only in Aramaic. The Biblical Hebrew counterpart to this word, (&quot;‘zb&quot;) is seen in the second verse of the Old Testament&#x27;s Psalm 22, which the saying appears to quote. Thus, Jesus is not quoting the canonical Hebrew version (&quot;ēlī ēlī lāmā ‘azabtānī&quot;), which the psalm claims was of King David, but rather the version in an Aramaic Targum (translation of the Bible). Surviving Aramaic Targums do use the verb &quot;šbq&quot; in their translations of the Psalm 22.

The word used in the Gospel of Mark for &quot;my god&quot;, Ἐλωΐ, corresponds to the Aramaic form אלהי, &quot;elāhī&quot;. The one used in Matthew, Ἠλί, fits in better with the אלי of the original Hebrew Psalm, as has been pointed out in the literature; however, it may also be Aramaic because this form is attested abundantly in Aramaic as well.

In the next verse, in both accounts, some who hear Jesus&#x27; cry imagine that he is calling for help from Elijah (&quot;Ēlīyā&quot; in Aramaic).

Almost all ancient Greek manuscripts show signs of trying to normalize the two slightly different versions of Jesus&#x27;s saying, presented in Mark and Matthew. For instance, the peculiar Codex Bezae renders both versions with ηλι ηλι λαμα ζαφθανι (&quot;ēli ēli lama zaphthani&quot;). The Alexandrian, Western and Caesarean textual families all reflect harmonization of the texts between Matthew and Mark. Only the Byzantine textual tradition preserves a distinction.

The Aramaic word form &quot;šəḇaqtanī&quot; is based on the verb &quot;šǝḇaq&quot;/&quot;šāḇaq&quot;, &#x27;to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake&#x27;, with the perfect aspect ending &quot;-t&quot; (second person singular: &#x27;you&#x27;), and the object suffix &quot;-anī&quot; (first person singular: &#x27;me&#x27;).

The most likely rendition of the phrase in its original Aramaic, as said by Jesus, would have been &quot;אלי, אלי, למה שבקתני&quot;, transliterated as &quot;Eli, Eli, ləmā šəḇaqtanī.&quot;

In Hebrew, the saying would be &quot;&quot; (&quot;ēlī ēlī, lāmā ‘azabtānī&quot; in Biblical Hebrew, &quot;eli eli lama azavtani&quot; in Modern Hebrew pronunciation), while the Syriac-Aramaic phrase according to the Peshitta would be (Matthew 27:46) or (Mark 15:34).

This saying is taken by some as an abandonment of the Son by the Father. Another interpretation holds that at the moment when Jesus took upon himself the sins of humanity, the Father had to turn away from the Son because the Father is &quot;of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong&quot; (ESV). Other theologians understand the cry as that of one who was truly human and who felt forsaken. Put to death by his foes, very largely deserted by his friends, he may have also felt deserted by God.

Others see these words in the context of Psalm 22 and suggest that Jesus recited these words, perhaps even the whole psalm, &quot;that he might show himself to be the very Being to whom the words refer; so that the Jewish scribes and people might examine and see the cause why he would not descend from the cross; namely, because this very psalm showed that it was appointed that he should suffer these things.&quot;

===Jot and tittle ()===

Matthew 5:18
:&quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the Law (that is, the Torah) till all is fulfilled.&quot;

The quotation uses them as an example of extremely minor details. In the Greek text translated as English jot and tittle is found &quot;iota&quot; and &quot;keraia&quot;. Iota is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet (ι), but since only capitals were used at the time the Greek New Testament was written (Ι; still, it is the smallest of all the Greek majuscules) and because the Torah was written in Hebrew, it probably represents the Hebrew yodh (י) which is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. &quot;Keraia&quot; is a hook or serif.

===Korban (Κορβάν)===

Matthew 27:6
:&quot;But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, ‘It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.’&quot;

In Aramaic (קרבנא) it refers to the treasury in the Temple in Jerusalem, derived from the Hebrew Korban (קרבן), found in Mark 7:11 and the Septuagint (in Greek transliteration), meaning &quot;religious gift&quot; or &quot;offering&quot;.

The Greek is declined as a Greek noun, much like other examples.

===Sikera (Σίκερα)===

Luke 1:15
:&quot;for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink; even before his birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit.&quot;

===Hosanna ()===

Mark 11:9
:&quot;Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!&quot;

This word is derived from הושע נא. It is generally considered to be a quote from Psalms 118:25 &quot;O , save (us)&quot;, but the original Biblical Hebrew form was הושיעה נא. The shortened form הושע could be either Aramaic or Hebrew.

==Aramaic personal names in the New Testament==
Personal names in the New Testament come from a number of languages; Hebrew and Greek are most common. However, there are a few Aramaic names as well. The most prominent feature in Aramaic names is &quot;bar&quot; (Greek transliteration βαρ, Aramaic &quot;bar&quot;), meaning &#x27;son of&#x27;, a common patronym prefix. Its Hebrew equivalent, &quot;ben&quot;, is conspicuous by its absence. Some examples are:
*  – Bartholomew (Βαρθολομαῖος from &quot;bar-Tōlmay&quot;, perhaps &quot;son of furrows&quot; or &quot;ploughman&quot;).
*  – Simon bar-Jona (Σίμων Βαριωνᾶς from &quot;Šim‘ōn bar-Yōnā&quot;, &quot;Simon son of Jonah&quot;).
*  – Simon bar-Jochanan (&quot;Simon son of John&quot;).
*  – Barabbas (Βαραββᾶς from &quot;bar-Abbā&quot;, &quot;son of the father&quot;).
*  – Bartimaeus (Βαρτιμαῖος possibly from combination of Aramaic &quot;bar&quot; and Greek &quot;timaios&quot; meaning &quot;honorable&quot; or &quot;highly prized&quot;, perhaps &quot;honorable son&quot;).
*  – Barsabbas (Βαρσαββᾶς from &quot;bar-Šabbā&quot;, &quot;son of the &quot;).
*  – Joseph who is called Barnabas (Βαρνάβας from &quot;bar-Navā&quot; meaning &quot;son of prophecy&quot;, &quot;the prophet&quot;, but given the Greek translation υἱὸς παρακλήσεως; usually translated as &quot;son of consolation/encouragement&quot;, the Greek could mean &quot;invocation&quot; as well).
*  – Bar-Jesus (Βαριησοῦς from &quot;bar-Išo&quot;, &quot;son of Jesus/Joshua&quot;).

===Boanerges (Βοανηργές)===
Mark 3:17
: &quot;And James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, and he gave them the name Boanerges, which is Sons of Thunder.&quot;

Jesus surnames the brothers James and John to reflect their impetuosity. The Greek rendition of their name is Βοανηργές (Boanērges).

The name &quot;&quot; has given rise to much speculation. Given the Greek translation provided by the Biblical text (&#x27;Sons of Thunder&#x27;), it seems that the first element of the name is &quot;bnē&quot;, &#x27;sons of&#x27; (the plural of &#x27;bar&#x27;), Aramaic (בני). This is represented by βοάνη (boanē), giving two vowels in the first syllable where one would be sufficient. It could be inferred from this that the Greek transliteration may not be a good one. The second part of the name is often reckoned to be &quot;rḡaš&quot; (&#x27;tumult&#x27;) Aramaic (רגיש), or &quot;rḡaz&quot; (&#x27;anger&#x27;) Aramaic (רגז). Maurice Casey, however, argues that &quot;rḡaš&quot; is a simple misreading of the word for thunder, &quot;rḡam&quot; (due to the similarity of the Square script symbols samech and mem, for the Aramaic [s] and final [m]).
This is supported by one Syriac translation of the name as &quot;bnay ra‘mâ&quot;. The Peshitta reads ܒܢܝ ܪܓܫܝ &quot;bnay rḡešy&quot;, which would fit with a later composition for it, based on a Byzantine reading of the original Greek.

===Cephas (Κηφᾶς)===
John 1:42
: &quot;He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;You are Simon son of John, you shall be called Cephas&quot;, which is translated &#x27;Peter&#x27;.&quot; (New International Version)
1 Corinthians 1:12
: &quot;But I say that each of you says &quot;I am of Paul&quot;, or &quot;I am of Apollos&quot;, or &quot;I am of Cephas&quot;, or &quot;I am of Christ&quot;.&quot;
Galatians 1:18 NRSV
:&quot;Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him for fifteen days;&quot;

In these passages, &#x27;Cephas&#x27; is given as the nickname of the apostle better known as Simon Peter. The Greek word is transliterated (Kēphâs).

The apostle&#x27;s given name appears to be Simon, and he is given the Aramaic nickname, &quot;kēpā&quot;, meaning &#x27;rock&#x27; or &#x27;stone&#x27;. The final sigma (&quot;ς&quot;) is added in Greek to make the name masculine rather than feminine. That the meaning of the name was more important than the name itself is evidenced by the universal acceptance of the Greek translation, (Petros). It is not known why Paul uses the Aramaic name rather than the Greek name for Simon Peter when he writes to the churches in Galatia and Corinth. He may have been writing at a time before Cephas came to be popularly known as Peter.

According to Clement of Alexandria, there were two people named Cephas: one was Apostle Simon Peter, and the other was one of Jesus&#x27; &quot;Seventy Apostles&quot;. Clement goes further to say it was Cephas of the Seventy who was condemned by Paul in Galatians 2 for not eating with the Gentiles, though this is perhaps Clement&#x27;s way of deflecting the condemnation from Simon Peter. In 1708, a French Jesuit, Jean Hardouin, wrote a dissertation that argues &quot;Peter&quot; was actually &quot;another Peter&quot;, thus the emphasis of using the name Cephas (Aramaic for &quot;Peter&quot;). In 1990 Bart D. Ehrman wrote an article on the &quot;Journal of Biblical Literature&quot;, similarly arguing that Peter and Cephas should be understood as different people, citing the writing of Clement of Alexandria and the Epistula Apostolorum and in support of his theory; Ehrman&#x27;s article received a detailed critique by Dale Allison, who argued that Peter and Cephas are the same person. Ehrman later retracted his proposal, deeming it &quot;highly unlikely&quot;.

In Aramaic, it could be כיפא.

===Thomas (Θωμᾶς)===
John 11:16
: &quot;Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his co-disciples, &quot;Now let us go that we might die with him!&quot;&quot;

Thomas () is listed among the disciples of Jesus in all four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. However, it is only in John&#x27;s Gospel that more information is given. In three places (John 11:16, 20:24 and 21:2), he is given the name Didymus (), the Greek word for a twin. In fact, &quot;the Twin&quot; is not just a surname, it is a translation of &quot;Thomas&quot;. The Greek —Thōmâs—comes from the Aramaic &quot;tōmā&quot;, &quot;twin&quot;. Therefore, rather than two personal names, Thomas Didymus, there is a single nickname, the Twin. Christian tradition gives him the personal name Judas, and he was perhaps named Thomas to distinguish him from others of the same name.

In Aramaic, it could be ܬܐܘܡܐ.

===Tabitha (Ταβιθά)===
Acts 9:36
: &quot;In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas.&quot;

The disciple&#x27;s name is given both in Aramaic (Ταβιθά) and Greek (Δορκάς). The Aramaic name is a transliteration of &quot;Ṭḇīthā&quot;, the female form of (&quot;Ṭaḇyā&quot;). Both names mean &#x27;gazelle&#x27;.

It may be just coincidence that Peter&#x27;s words to her in verse 40, &quot;Tabitha, get up!&quot; (), are similar to the &quot;talitha kum&quot; phrase used by Jesus.

In Aramaic, it could be טביתא.

==Aramaic place names in the New Testament==
===Gethsemane (Γεθσημανῆ)===
Matthew 26:36
: &quot;Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane.&quot;
Mark 14:32
: &quot;And they went to a place that has the name Gethsemane.&quot;

The place where Jesus takes his disciples to pray before his arrest is given the Greek transliteration Γεθσημανῆ (Gethsēmanē). It represents the Aramaic &quot;Gath-Šmānē&quot;, meaning &#x27;the oil press&#x27; or &#x27;oil vat&#x27; (referring to olive oil).

In Aramaic, it could be ܓܕܣܡܢ. This place name is more properly an Aramaized version of an original Hebrew place name. &quot;Gath&quot; גת is a normal word for press in Hebrew, generally used for a wine press not an olive press though; and &quot;shemanei&quot; שמני is the Hebrew word &quot;shemanim&quot; שמנים meaning &quot;oils&quot;, the plural form of the word &quot;shemen&quot; שמן, the primary Hebrew word for oil, just in a construct form (&quot;-ei&quot; instead of the ordinary plural suffix &quot;-im&quot;). The word in Aramaic for &quot;oil&quot; is more properly &quot;mišḥa&quot; (משחא), as also attested in Jewish writings in Aramaic from the Galilee (see Caspar Levias, A Grammar of Galilean Aramaic, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1986).

===Golgotha (Γολγοθᾶ)===
Mark 15:22
: &quot;And they took him up to the place Golgotha, which is translated Place of the Skull.&quot;
John 19:17
: &quot;And carrying his cross by himself, he went out to the so-called Place of the Skull, which is called in &#x27;Hebrew&#x27; Golgotha.&quot;

&quot;Gagūltā&quot; Aramaic, means &#x27;skull&#x27;. The name appears in all of the gospels except Luke, which calls the place simply &quot;Kranion&quot; (Κρανίον) &#x27;the Skull&#x27; in Greek, with no Semitic counterpart. The name &#x27;Calvary&#x27; is taken from the Latin Vulgate translation, Calvaria.

In Aramaic, it could be ܓܓܘܠܬܐ. Though this word has the Aramaic final form &quot;-ta&quot; / &quot;-tha&quot;, it is otherwise also closer to the Hebrew word for skull, &quot;gulgolet&quot; גולגולת, than to the Aramaic form.

===Gabbatha (Γαββαθᾶ)===
John 19:13
: &quot;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&#x27;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.&quot;

The place name appears to be Aramaic. According to Josephus, &quot;War&quot;, V.ii.1, #51, the word &quot;Gabath&quot; means &quot;high place&quot;, or &quot;elevated place&quot;, so perhaps a raised flat area near the temple. The final &quot;א&quot; could then represent the emphatic state of the noun.

In Aramaic, it could be גבהתא.

===Akeldama (Ἀκελδαμά) ===
Acts 1:19
: &quot;And this became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that field was called, in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is Field of Blood.&quot;

The place of Judas Iscariot&#x27;s death is clearly named Field of Blood in Greek. However, the manuscript tradition gives a number of different spellings of the Aramaic. The Majority Text reads Ἀκελδαμά (&quot;Akeldama&quot;); other manuscript versions give Ἀχελδαμάχ (&quot;Acheldamach&quot;), Ἁκελδαμά (&quot;Hakeldama&quot;), Ἁχελδαμά (&quot;Hacheldama&quot;) and Ἁκελδαμάχ (&quot;Hakeldamach&quot;). Despite these variant spellings the Aramaic is most probably &quot;ḥqēl dmā&quot;, &#x27;field of blood&#x27;. While the seemingly gratuitous Greek sound of &quot;kh&quot; at the end of the word is difficult to explain, the Septuagint similarly adds this sound to the end of the Semitic name Ben Sira to form the Greek name for the Book of &quot;Sirakh&quot; (). The sound may be a dialectic feature of either the Greek speakers or the original Semitic language speakers.

In Aramaic, it could be חקל דמא.

===Pool of Bethesda (Βηθεσδά)===
John 5:2
: &quot;Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.&quot;

&quot;Bethesda&quot; was originally the name of a pool in Jerusalem, on the path of the Beth Zeta Valley, and is also known as the &quot;Sheep Pool&quot;. Its name in Aramaic means &quot;House of Grace&quot;. It is associated with healing. In John 5, Jesus was reported healing a man at the pool.

For other Aramaic place names in the New Testament beginning with &quot;beth&quot; (&quot;house of&quot;), see Bethabara, Bethany, Bethphage and Bethsaida and Bethlehem.

In Aramaic, &quot;Bethesda&quot; could be spelled בית חסדא.

<text>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (College Street site) is a psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Ontario. It is located at 250 College Street, just east of Spadina Avenue. Much of its work focuses on forensic psychology, sex addiction, drug addiction, and research designed to shape public policy.

The hospital was originally founded in 1966 as the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, after Charles Kirk Clarke, a pioneer in mental health in Canada. In 1998, it merged with several other Ontario institutions to form the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), and the facility is now called the CAMH College Street site.

Until 2020 when the department was moved to the Queen Street Site, CAMH&#x27;s College Street and Spadina Avenue location was the only 24-hour emergency psychiatric care facility in Ontario.

<doc id="1248873" wikidata="Q7985711" url="?curid=1248873" title="West Langdon">
<text>West Langdon is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Langdon, in the Dover district of Kent, England. It is located five miles north of Dover town. In 1961 the parish had a population of 68. On 1 April 1963 the parish was abolished and merged with East Langdon to form &quot;Langdon&quot;.

The name &quot;Langdon&quot; derives from an Old English word meaning &quot;long hill&quot;. The first known written reference dates to 861 AD, mentioning one &quot;Langandune&quot;, but around 1200 AD there was a reference to Estlangedoun (East Langdon, about one mile to the south east) and Westlangedone.

The Church is dedicated to Saint Mary. The remains of Langdon Abbey are nearby.

<text>The Pottawatomi River is a river in the municipalities of Owen Sound and Georgian Bluffs, Grey County in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and empties into Owen Sound, an inlet of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron, at Owen Sound Harbour.

==Course==
The river begins in a field in geographic Derby Township in Georgian Bluffs. It flows southeast, then turns northeast for the remainder of its course. It passes under Ontario Highway 21 at the community of Springmount, and passes over the Niagara Escarpment at Jones Falls. The river then takes in the right tributary Maxwell Creek, enters the municipality of Owen Sound, and reaches its mouth at Georgian Bay.

<text>Amanda Coogan (born 1971) is an Irish performance artist, living and working in Dublin. She studied under the performance artist Marina Abramović at the HBK Hochschule für Bildende Kunste, Braunschweig, Germany. In her performance art, she produces videos and photographs from live performances. Her work often begins with her own body and often challenges the expectations born of context.

==Early life==
Coogan was born in Dublin. She studied Painting at Limerick School of Art and Design, Ireland, Athens School of Fine Arts, Greece, and Sculpture at the National College of Art and Design, Dublin and under the performance artist Marina Abramović at the HBK Hochschule fur Bildende Kunste, Braunschweig, Germany. She received her PhD from the University of Ulster in 2013.

==Career==
In her performance art, she produces videos and photographs from live performances. Her work often begins with her own body and often challenges the expectations born of context. Not deaf herself, she is a first language signer and in one striking work, she dances to Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,&quot; while signing the lyrics. In a more recent work, produced for the Liverpool Biennial, she filmed local people headbanging to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy.&quot;

Coogan has exhibited at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, was an award winner at EV+A 2002 in Limerick, was selected by the Royal Hibernian Academy for the Eurojets Futures exhibition in 2003, and was an invited participant in the 2004 Liverpool Biennial.

<text>The Yopy was the name of a series of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) made by GMate Corporation, also used as a popular PDA Phone in Korea and based on the Linux operating system. The Linux Documentation Project considers the Yopy series to be &quot;true Linux PDAs&quot; because their manufacturers install Linux-based operating systems on them by default.

== Overview ==

At the CeBIT 2000, GMate introduced the YDK1000, the Yopy Development Kit. Without a physical keyboard this device looked very different from later versions. It came with an embedded Linux operating system and the W Window System. Later also precompiled versions of the X Window System and the IceWM window manager became available.

The first official model in the Yopy line of PDAs was the YP3000. It introduced the clam shell design with a full-Qwerty keyboard, and featured a 3.5 inch TFT screen. It also came with the X Window System and IceWM.

One of the features of the YP3500 is a CDMA module, so it can be used as a mobile phone. In 2003, Wi-Fi was widely used in Korea, and so the YP3700 targeted this environment with an additional Wi-Fi module.

By March 2005 Gmate had stopped producing and selling the Yopy PDA and closed down its official web sites.

== Yopy models ==

* YDK1000, the Yopy Development Kit
* YP3000, the first official model of the Yopy
* YP3500, CDMA module was added in YP3500
* YP3700, Wi-Fi module was added in YP3700

== Yopy software ==
Because it used the Linux operating system, the Yopy was capable of running a variety of open source software.

== Trivia ==
Yopy is a recursive acronym, standing for &quot;Your own personal Yopy&quot;.

<doc id="1248897" wikidata="Q712688" url="?curid=1248897" title="Japanese nuclear weapons program">
<text>During World War II, Japan had several programs exploring the use of nuclear fission for military technology, including nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Like the similar wartime programs in Nazi Germany, it was relatively small, suffered from an array of problems brought on by lack of resources and wartime disarray, and was ultimately unable to progress beyond the laboratory stage during the war. 

Today, Japan has no known nuclear weapons programs. It is a signatory in good standing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has enacted domestic legal prohibitions against producing nuclear weapons. However, it is unique among non-nuclear weapons states in that it possesses a full nuclear fuel cycle, as part of its civilian nuclear energy industry, and advanced developments in the industries necessary to make nuclear weapons. As a result, it is often cited as a primary example of a latent or threshold nuclear state, capable of developing weapons in a very short timespan should its government decide to do so.

==Background==

In 1934, Tohoku University professor Hikosaka Tadayoshi&#x27;s &quot;atomic physics theory&quot; was released. Hikosaka pointed out the huge energy contained by nuclei and the possibility that both nuclear power generation and weapons could be created. In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot; reporting that they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons; simultaneously, they communicated these results to Lise Meitner. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission and Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. Physicists around the world immediately realized that chain reactions could be produced and notified their governments of the possibility of developing nuclear weapons.

==World War II==

The leading figure in the Japanese atomic program was Yoshio Nishina, a close associate of Niels Bohr and a contemporary of Albert Einstein. Nishina had co-authored the Klein–Nishina formula. Nishina had established his own Nuclear Research Laboratory to study high-energy physics in 1931 at RIKEN Institute (the Institute for Physical and Chemical Research), which had been established in 1917 in Tokyo to promote basic research. Nishina had built his first cyclotron in 1936, and another , 220-ton cyclotron in 1937. In 1938 Japan also purchased a cyclotron from the University of California, Berkeley.

Due to the German-Japanese alliance resulting from Germany&#x27;s Four Year Plan, Japan and its military had already been pursuing nuclear science to catch up to the West in nuclear technology. This allowed for Nishina to introduce quantum mechanics to Japan.

In 1939, Nishina recognized the military potential of nuclear fission, and was worried that the Americans were working on a nuclear weapon which might be used against Japan.

In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein–Szilard letter, which warned of the potential development of &quot;extremely powerful bombs of a new type&quot;.
The United States started the investigations into fission weapons in the United States, which eventually evolved into the massive Manhattan Project, and the laboratory from which Japan purchased a cyclotron became one of the major sites for weapons research.

In the early summer of 1940, Nishina met Lieutenant-General Takeo Yasuda on a train. Yasuda was at the time director of the Army Aeronautical Department&#x27;s Technical Research Institute. Nishina told Yasuda about the possibility of building nuclear weapons. However, the Japanese fission project did not formally begin until April 1941 when Yasuda acted on Army Minister Hideki Tōjō&#x27;s order to investigate the possibilities of nuclear weapons. Yasuda passed the order down the chain of command to Viscount Masatoshi Ōkōchi, director of the RIKEN Institute, who in turn passed it to Nishina, whose Nuclear Research Laboratory by 1941 had over 100 researchers.

=== B-Research ===
Meanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Technology Research Institute had been pursuing its own separate investigations, and had engaged professors from the Imperial University, Tokyo, for advice on nuclear weapons. Before the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Captain Yoji Ito of the Naval Technical Research Institution of Japan initiated a study that would allow for the Japanese Navy to use nuclear fission. After consulting with Professor Sagane at Tokyo Imperial University, his research showed that nuclear fission would be a potential power source for the Navy.

This resulted in the formation of the Committee on Research in the Application of Nuclear Physics, chaired by Nishina, that met ten times between July 1942 and March 1943. After the Japanese Navy lost at Midway, Captain Ito proposed a new type of nuclear weapons development designated as &quot;B-Research&quot; (also called &quot;Jin Project&quot;, , lit. &quot;Nuclear Project&quot;) by the end of June 1942. By December, deep in the project, it became evident that while an atomic bomb was feasible in principle, &quot;Japanese scientists believed that it would be difficult for even the United States to realize the application of atomic energy in time to influence the outcome of the war.&quot; This caused the Navy to lose interest and to concentrate instead on research into radar.

===Ni-Go Project===
In 1942 the Army was not discouraged, and soon after the Committee issued its report it set up an experimental project at RIKEN, the Ni-Go Project (lit. &quot;The Second Project&quot;). Its aim was to separate uranium-235 by thermal diffusion, ignoring alternative methods such as electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and centrifugal separation.

By spring 1944, the Nishina Project barely made any progress due to insufficient uranium hexafluoride for its Clusius tube. The previously provided uranium within the copper tube had corroded and the project was unable to separate U-235 isotopes.

By February 1945, a small group of scientists had succeeded in producing a small amount of material in a rudimentary separator in the RIKEN complex—material which RIKEN&#x27;s cyclotron indicated was &quot;not&quot; uranium-235. The separator project came to an end in March 1945, when the building housing it was destroyed by a fire caused by the USAAF&#x27;s &quot;Operation Meetinghouse&quot; raid on Tokyo. No attempt was made to build a uranium pile; heavy water was unavailable, but Takeuchi Masa, who was in charge of Nishina&#x27;s separator, calculated that light water would suffice if the uranium could be enriched to 5–10% uranium-235.

While these experiments were in progress, the Army and Navy searched for uranium ore, in locations ranging from Fukushima Prefecture to Korea, China, and Burma. The Japanese also requested materials from their German allies and of unprocessed uranium oxide was dispatched to Japan in April 1945 aboard the submarine , which however surrendered to US forces in the Atlantic following Germany&#x27;s surrender. The uranium oxide was reportedly labeled as &quot;U-235&quot;, which may have been a mislabeling of the submarine&#x27;s name and its exact characteristics remain unknown; some sources believe that it was not weapons-grade material and was intended for use as a catalyst in the production of synthetic methanol to be used for aviation fuel.

The attack also effectively destroyed the Clusius tube and any chances of the Japanese producing an atomic bomb in time to influence the war in their favor and rival the West in nuclear weaponry.

According to the historian Williams, &quot;The same lack of sufficient high quality uranium that had impeded the German atomic project had also, as it turned out, obstructed Japanese attempts to make a bomb.&quot; This was the conclusion of the Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, who also reported Japan&#x27;s nuclear physicists were just as good as those from other nations.

===F-Go Project===
In 1943, a different Japanese naval command began a nuclear research program, the F-Go Project (lit. &quot;The F Project&quot;), under Bunsaku Arakatsu at the Imperial University, Kyoto. Arakatsu had spent some years studying abroad including at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford and at Berlin University under Albert Einstein. Next to Nishina, Arakatsu was the most notable nuclear physicist in Japan. His team included Hideki Yukawa, who would become in 1949 the first Japanese physicist to receive a Nobel Prize.

Early on in the war Commander Kitagawa, head of the Navy Research Institute&#x27;s Chemical Section, had requested Arakatsu to carry out work on the separation of Uranium-235. The work went slowly, but shortly before the end of the war he had designed an ultracentrifuge (to spin at 60,000 rpm) which he was hopeful would achieve the required results. Only the design of the machinery was completed before the Japanese surrender.

After Arakatsu and Nishina&#x27;s meeting, in spring 1944, the Army-Navy Technology Enforcement Committee formed due to lack of progress in the development of Japanese nuclear weapons. This led to the only meeting of the leaders of the F-Go Project scientists, on 21 July 1945. After the meeting, nuclear weaponry research ended as a result of the destruction of the facility that housed isotope separation research, known as Building 49.

Shortly after the surrender of Japan, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Atomic Bomb Mission, which had deployed to Japan in September, reported that the F-Go Project had obtained 20 grams a month of heavy water from electrolytic ammonia plants in Korea and Kyushu. In fact, the industrialist Jun Noguchi had launched a heavy water production program some years previously. In 1926, Noguchi founded the Korean Hydro Electric Company at Konan (now known as Hungnam) in north-eastern Korea: this became the site of an industrial complex producing ammonia for fertilizer production. However, despite the availability of a heavy-water production facility whose output could potentially have rivalled that of Norsk Hydro at Vemork in Norway, it appears that the Japanese did not carry out neutron-multiplication studies using heavy water as a moderator at Kyoto.

===Postwar aftermath===
On 16 October 1945, Nishina sought permission from the American occupation forces to use the two cyclotrons at the Riken Institute for biological and medical research, which was soon granted; however, on 10 November instructions were received from the US Secretary of War in Washington to destroy the cyclotrons at the Riken, Kyoto University, and Osaka University. This was done on 24 November; the Riken&#x27;s cyclotrons were taken apart and thrown into Tokyo Bay.

In a letter of protest against this destruction Nishina wrote that the cyclotrons at the Riken had had nothing to do with the production of nuclear weapons, however the large cyclotron had officially been a part of the Ni-Go Project. Nishina had placed it within the Project by suggesting that the cyclotron could serve basic research for the use of nuclear power, simply so that he could continue working on the device; the military nature of the Project gave him access to funding and kept his researchers from being drafted into the armed forces. He felt no qualms about this because he saw no possibility of producing nuclear weapons in Japan before the end of the war.

===Reports of a Japanese weapon test===
On 2 October 1946, the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; published a story by reporter David Snell, who had been an investigator with the 24th Criminal Investigation Detachment in Korea after the war, which alleged that the Japanese had successfully tested a nuclear weapon near Hungnam (Konan) before the town was captured by the Soviets. He said that he had received his information at Seoul in September 1945 from a Japanese officer to whom he gave the pseudonym of Captain Wakabayashi, who had been in charge of counter-intelligence at Hungnam. SCAP officials, who were responsible for strict censorship of all information about Japan&#x27;s wartime interest in nuclear physics, were dismissive of Snell&#x27;s report.

Under the 1947–1948 investigation, comments were sought from Japanese scientists who would or should have known about such a project. Further doubt is cast on Snell&#x27;s story by the lack of evidence of large numbers of Japanese scientists leaving Japan for Korea and never returning. Snell&#x27;s statements were repeated by Robert K. Wilcox in his 1985 book &quot;Japan&#x27;s Secret War: Japan&#x27;s Race Against Time to Build Its Own Atomic Bomb&quot;. The book also included what Wilcox stated was new evidence from intelligence material which indicated the Japanese might have had an atomic program at Hungnam. These specific reports were dismissed in a review of the book by Department of Energy employee Roger M. Anders which was published in the journal &quot;Military Affairs&quot;, an article written by two historians of science in the journal &quot;Isis&quot;, and another article in the journal &quot;Intelligence and National Security&quot;.

==Postwar==
Since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has been a staunch upholder of antinuclear sentiments. Its postwar Constitution forbids the establishment of offensive military forces, and in 1967 it adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, ruling out the production, possession, or introduction of nuclear weapons. Despite this, the idea that Japan might become a nuclear power has persisted. After China&#x27;s first nuclear test in 1964, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Satō said to President Lyndon Johnson when they met in January 1965, that if the Chinese Communists had nuclear weapons, the Japanese should also have them. This shocked Johnson&#x27;s administration, especially when Sato added that &quot;Japanese public opinion will not permit this at present, but I believe that the public, especially the younger generation, can be &#x27;educated&#x27;.&quot;

Throughout Sato&#x27;s administration Japan continued to discuss the nuclear option. It was suggested that tactical nuclear weapons, as opposed to larger strategic weapons, could be defined as defensive, and therefore be allowed by the Japanese Constitution. A White Paper commissioned by future Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone opined that it would be possible that possessing small-yield, purely defensive nuclear weapons would not violate the Constitution, but that in view of the danger of adverse foreign reaction and possible war, a policy would be followed of not acquiring nuclear weapons &quot;at present&quot;.

===Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty===
The Johnson administration became anxious about Sato&#x27;s intentions and made securing Japan&#x27;s signature to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) one of its top priorities. In December 1967, to reassure the Japanese public, Sato announced the adoption of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. These were that Japan would not manufacture, possess, or permit nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. The principles, which were adopted by the Diet, but are not law, have remained the basis of Japan&#x27;s nuclear policy ever since.

According to Kei Wakaizumi, one of Sato&#x27;s policy advisers, Sato realized soon after making the declaration that it might be too constraining. He therefore clarified the principles in a February 1968 address to the Diet by declaring the &quot;Four Nuclear Policies&quot; (&quot;Four-Pillars Nuclear Policy&quot;):

* Promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy
* Efforts towards global nuclear disarmament
* Reliance and dependence on US extended deterrence, based on the 1960 US-Japan Security Treaty
* Support for the &quot;Three Non-Nuclear Principles under the circumstances where Japan&#x27;s national security is guaranteed by the other three policies.&quot;

It followed that if American assurance was ever removed or seemed unreliable, Japan might have no choice but to go nuclear. In other words, it kept the nuclear option available.

In 1969, a policy planning study for Japan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry concluded that Japan should, even if it signed the NPT, maintain the economic and technical ability to develop and produce nuclear weapons in case it should ever become necessary, for example due to the international situation.

Japan finally signed the NPT in 1970 and ratified it in 1976, but only after West Germany became a signatory and the US promised &quot;not to interfere with Tokyo&#x27;s pursuit of independent reprocessing capabilities in its civilian nuclear power program&quot;.

===Extension of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty===
In 1995, the Clinton administration pushed the Japanese government to endorse the indefinite extension of the NPT, but it opted for an ambiguous position on the issue. A former Japanese government official recalled, &quot;We thought it was better for us not to declare that we will give up our nuclear option forever and ever&quot;. However, eventually pressure from Washington and other nations led to Japan&#x27;s supporting the indefinite extension.

In 1998, two events strengthened the hand of those in Japan advocating that the nation should at least reconsider if not reverse its non-nuclear policy. Advocates of such policies included conservative academics, some government officials, a few industrialists, and nationalist groups.

The first of these events was India and Pakistan both conducting nuclear tests; the Japanese were troubled by a perceived reluctance on the part of the international community to condemn the two countries&#x27; actions, since one of the reasons Japan had opted to join the NPT was that it had anticipated severe penalties for those states who defied the international consensus against further nuclear proliferation. Also, Japan and other nations feared that an Indian nuclear arsenal could cause a localized nuclear arms race with China.

The second event was the August 1998 launch of a North Korean Taepodong-1 missile over Japan which caused a public outcry and led some to call for remilitarization or the development of nuclear weapons. Fukushiro Nukaga, head of the Japan Defense Agency, said that his government would be justified in mounting pre-emptive strikes against North Korean missile bases. Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi reiterated Japan&#x27;s non-nuclear weapon principles and said that Japan would not possess a nuclear arsenal, and that the matter was not even worthy of discussion.

However, it is thought that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi implied he agreed that Japan had the right to possess nuclear weapons when he added, &quot;it is significant that although we could have them, we don&#x27;t&quot;.

Earlier, Shinzō Abe had said that Japan&#x27;s constitution did not necessarily ban possession of nuclear weapons, so long as they were kept at a minimum and were tactical weapons, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda had expressed a similar view.

===De facto nuclear state===

While there are currently no known plans in Japan to produce nuclear weapons, it has been argued Japan has the technology, raw materials, and the capital to produce nuclear weapons within one year if necessary, and many analysts consider it a &quot;de facto&quot; nuclear state for this reason. For this reason Japan is often said to be a &quot;screwdriver&#x27;s turn&quot; away from possessing nuclear weapons, or to possess a &quot;bomb in the basement&quot;.

The United States stored extensive nuclear assets in Okinawa prefecture when it was under American administration until the 1970s. There were approximately 1,200 nuclear warheads in Okinawa.

Significant amounts of reactor-grade plutonium are created as a by-product of the nuclear energy industry. During the 1970s, the Japanese government made several appeals to the United States to use reprocessed plutonium in forming a &quot;plutonium economy&quot; for peaceful commercial use. This began a significant debate within the Carter administration about the risk of proliferation associated with reprocessing while also acknowledging Japan&#x27;s need for energy and right to the use of peaceful nuclear technology. Ultimately, an agreement was reached that allowed Japan to repurpose the byproducts of nuclear power-related activities; however their efforts regarding fast-breeding plutonium reactors were largely unsuccessful.

In 2012, Japan was reported to have 9 tonnes of plutonium stored in Japan, which would be enough for more than 1,000 nuclear warheads, and an additional 35 tonnes stored in Europe. It has constructed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, which could produce further plutonium. Japan has a considerable quantity of highly enriched uranium (HEU), supplied by the U.S. and UK, for use in its research reactors and fast neutron reactor research programs; approximately 1,200 to 1,400 kg of HEU as of 2014. Japan also possesses an indigenous uranium enrichment plant which could hypothetically be used to make highly enriched uranium suitable for weapons use.

Japan has also developed the M-V three-stage solid-fuel rocket, somewhat similar in design to the U.S. LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM, giving it a missile technology base. It now has an easier-to-launch second generation solid-fuel rocket, Epsilon. Japan has experience in re-entry vehicle technology (OREX, HOPE-X). Toshiyuki Shikata, a Tokyo Metropolitan Government adviser and former lieutenant general, said that part of the rationale for the fifth M-V Hayabusa mission, from 2003 to 2010, was that the re-entry and landing of its return capsule demonstrated &quot;that Japan&#x27;s ballistic missile capability is credible.&quot; A Japanese nuclear deterrent would probably be sea-based with ballistic missile submarines. In 2011, former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba explicitly backed the idea of Japan maintaining the capability of nuclear latency:
On 24 March 2014, Japan agreed to turn over more than of weapons grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium to the US, which started to be returned in 2016. It has been pointed out that as long as Japan enjoys the benefits of a &quot;nuclear-ready&quot; status held through surrounding countries, it will see no reason to actually produce nuclear arms, since by remaining below the threshold, although with the capability to cross it at short notice, Japan can expect the support of the US while posing as an equal to China and Russia.

Former Mayor and Governor of Osaka Tōru Hashimoto in 2008 argued on several television programs that Japan should possess nuclear weapons, but has since said that this was his private opinion.

Former Governor of Tokyo 1999-2012, Shintaro Ishihara was a advocate of Japan having nuclear weapons.

On 29 March 2016, then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested that Japan should develop its own nuclear weapons, claiming that it was becoming too expensive for the US to continue to protect Japan from countries such as China, North Korea, and Russia that already have their own nuclear weapons.

On 27 February 2022, former prime minister Shinzo Abe proposed that Japan should consider a nuclear sharing arrangement with the US similar to NATO. This includes housing American nuclear weapons on Japanese soil for deterrence. This plan comes in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many Japanese politicians consider Vladimir Putin&#x27;s threat to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state to be a game changer.

Although an indigenous nuclear program in Japan is unlikely to develop due to low public support, the existential Chinese and North Korean threats have raised security concerns domestically. The role of public opinion is central, and studies show that threat perceptions—mainly of China’s growing military abilities—have strengthened Japanese public support for a nuclear program. Japan has long held negative views on nuclear weapons, and previously, even discussions of nuclear armament or deterrence in the country was unpopular due to a strong &quot;nuclear taboo&quot;. However, this taboo has been breaking, especially because Abe elevated the topic to mainstream politics during his tenure.

National identity is an important factor in Japanese nuclear armament. Since World War II, the peace constitution has greatly limited the ability of Japanese military advancement, restricting them from having an active military or waging war with another country. These restrictions and the strong desire of former colonies—especially Korea and China—for apology and reconciliation by Japan for its crimes and atrocities committed under pre-WWII imperialism, coupled with Japan&#x27;s refusal to make appropriate amends, led to the rise of a conservative branch of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan that encouraged revisions to the Peace Constitution and promoted, under former prime minister Shinzo Abe, &quot;healthy nationalism&quot;, which aimed to restore the Japanese public&#x27;s sense of pride in the country. The revisionists sought to &quot;create a new national identity&quot; that increased national pride, allowed for collective self-defense and removed &quot;institutional limitations on military activities&quot;.

Since the reliability of U.S. security guarantees shapes Japan&#x27;s nuclear policy, a strong American nuclear umbrella is necessary to prevent Japan from developing nuclear weapons of its own. Since the 1960s, however, Japanese confidence in U.S. security guarantees has been influenced by American foreign policy shifts, from Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Guam Doctrine&quot; to Trump&#x27;s desire for allies to provide more of their own security. Although Japan developing nuclear weapons would violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and potentially decrease U.S. power in East Asia, there is historical precedent for the U.S. to be complacent regarding Japan building nuclear arms: as long as Japan is a democracy, a friend of Washington and has high state capacity, the U.S. alliance would likely be maintained. This was the case for France and the United Kingdom, when they developed their own nuclear weapons after the end of the Second World War despite American deterrence.

<text>Trishul () is a low-level quick-reaction short range surface-to-air missile developed in India by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). It can also be used as an anti-sea skimmer from naval ship against low flying missile, attack helicopter and aircraft.

In 2008, Minister of Defence A. K. Antony officially announced the closure of the project on a written reply to Rajya Sabha after completion of Technology Demonstration (TD) phase. The development cost of Trishul Project was .

==History and development==
The Trishul missile project was commissioned in 1983 as a part of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. The primary objective was to produce short range surface to air missile with a reaction time below 6 seconds. In 1985, Trishul made its first unguided flight from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The missile made its first full range guided flight in 1989 but without television guidance (TVM) which was originally planned. Indian Army and Indian Air Force (IAF) wanted Trishul to replace the Soviet-era 9K33 Osa. On the other hand, Indian Navy wanted to purchase Barak 1 and Kashtan CIWS for point-defence role since Pakistan began acquiring Harpoon and Exocet from 1980s. By the late 1990s, DRDO pushed Trishul as an alternative to Barak 1 for Indian Navy. One of the biggest challenge faced by DRDO is to make Trishul skim just 5 meters above the sea waves at supersonic speed.

The project was planned to be completed by 1992 and to be fitted in Brahmaputra-class frigates as an anti-sea skimmer. In 1992, the missile was successfully fired reaching Mach 2 speed following a predetermined trajectory against a target mounted 7 meter above sea but variation in altimeter led to test failure. In 1997, the associated radar systems for detecting the incoming sea-skimmer were operational at INS Dronacharya, but Indian Navy expressed its displeasure in the developmental delay of Trishul for the Brahmaputra-class frigates and finally opted for Barak 1. Trishul was unable to complete all the static trials from a fixed launcher until 1998. By May 1998, Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) was able to produce Trishul while the 27 tonne launch system was developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). The first missile produced by BDL was test fired against Northrop BQM-74 Chukar in June.

Upon reviewed by DRDO and the Indian Armed Forces in October 2001, the missile system was found deficient as the tracking radar beam was getting intermittent breaks resulting in the missile missing the target and the heavy BMP-2 chassis did not meet the General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs) for swift mobility due to heavy weight. On 25 January 2002, the naval variant of Trishul was test fired from INS Dronacharya but failed at sea-skimming capability.

In 2003, Government of India announced that the missile will be a technology demonstrator and de-linked it from Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. But Ministry of Defence (MoD) was not interested in downgrading the Trishul Missile project. After modification in guidance, sub-systems and propellant composition, four missiles in full combat configuration was launched from BMP-2 from June 22 to June 25, 2003. The test achieved miss distance against moving targets above the specified requirement of the Indian Armed Forces. All the sub-systems, air frames, controls, integrated with ground control system of the combat vehicle worked well. By this time Trishul became more of a research and development oriented project instead of a user driven one backed by the armed forces. Trishul was successfully test fired from Integrated Test Range (ITR) on 10 February, 26 March and 27 March 2004. On 5 October 2005, Trishul fired towards the sea from ITR was able to hit a pilot-less target aircraft.

Until October 2006, 80 flight tests were already completed and DRDO was in dialogue with the IAF for user trials and induction. In 2006, Minister of Defence Pranab Mukherjee granted one-year extension to Trishul project. Due to project delays, and modification of GSQRs and operational requirements over time, Trishul no longer able to meet the need of the end users. For continuation of the project and funding, it was proposed that the missile will be deployed in certain locations to conduct training, fire control, and air defence practice. As per Ministry of Defence (MoD), Trishul Project met the performance parameters set by the original GSQRs but failed to achieve the perfect three-beam guidance and development of millimeter-wave active radar homing seeker. The team of 200 scientists working on Trishul were reassigned for Barak 8, a joint project between DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAF finally selected SPYDER as an alternative to Trishul. To fulfill IAF requirement, DRDO made another attempt with MBDA on a joint project called Maitri. But it got cancelled due to lack of interest. All the proven technologies and learning from Trishul later helped DRDO in QRSAM and VL-SRSAM. People who worked on Trishul and Barak 8 termed the basic design flaw as one of the many reasons behind the project failure.

==Characteristics==
Trishul has a range between to . DRDO also made an enhanced range variant for the Indian Air Force. It is powered by a Dual-thrust propulsion stage using high-energy solid propellant. Trishul weighs and is capable of carrying a warhead. Trishul is 3 m in length and 20 cm in diameter. The modified naval variant use command to line-of-sight guidance mechanism. The missile can be employed against sea skimmers with a fire control radar. Trishul flies at supersonic speed. It has a low altitude radio altimeter and height lock loop control.

<text>Rhonda Ross Kendrick (born Rhonda Suzanne Silberstein; August 14, 1971) is an American singer and former actress. Kendrick is the daughter of singer and actress Diana Ross and the biological child of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy; however, her legal father is Robert Ellis Silberstein, as her mother was married to him before she was born and he is the father who raised her.

== Early life ==
At the time of Rhonda&#x27;s birth, Diana Ross was married to her first husband, Robert Ellis Silberstein. Ross, Gordy, and Silberstein all knew of Rhonda&#x27;s parentage. She was publicly presented as the daughter of Ross and Silberstein, and he raised her. When she was 13, she was told Gordy was her biological father. Ross Kendrick has said that the revelation came as a relief. She was beginning to notice physical differences between herself and her younger sisters. The revelation gave her an answer to the situation. Rhonda Ross Kendrick is the eldest of Diana Ross&#x27; five children and the seventh of Berry Gordy&#x27;s eight biological children. She is a graduate of Brown University.

== Career ==
Ross Kendrick&#x27;s most famous acting credit is Toni Burrell on &quot;Another World&quot;. She played the role from 1997 to 1999 and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1998. She also appeared in the movie &quot;The Personals&quot; (1999) with Malik Yoba as well as &quot;The Temptations&quot; miniseries with her relative Bianca Lawson. In 2004, she released her debut live album &quot;Rhonda Ross Live Featuring Rodney Kendrick&quot;.

After working for two years as an agent with the firm Citi Habitats, she founded Ross Realty International, a real-estate brokerage firm in New York City in 2008.

In 2013, she joined her mother on the In the Name of Love Tour as the opening act for her concerts. In July 2016, she released her first studio album &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;. The album spawned the singles &quot;Summer Day&quot; and &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, Rhonda contributed her songwriting talents to her mother&#x27;s Grammy nominated album Thank You released on Decca Records in late 2021. The album included the single &quot;All is Well&quot; co-written by Rhonda, her mother, and celebrated songwriter and background singer Fred White.

== Personal life ==
On September 14, 1997, she married jazz musician Rodney Kendrick. On August 7, 2009, she gave birth to their son.

<text>xCBL is a collection of XML specifications (both DTD and XML Schema) for use in e-business. It was created by Commerce One Inc. and is maintained by Perfect Commerce.

== History ==

xCBL was originally called Common Business Library (CBL). The xCBL standardization began in 1997. 

This led to the creation of xCBL 2.0 which covered 12 different business document specifications, mainly meant for electronic document communication in business-to-business (B2B) procurement over the Internet. xCBL 2.0 was mainly based on existing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards and introduced the Schema for Object-Oriented XML (SOX) schema library for XML validation.

:xCBL 3.0 contained several new business specifications and categories. It also introduced the use of several XML Schema standards.

:xCBL 3.5 (October 2001) contained nine new business documents. OASIS used this version as the starting point for defining business documents in Universal Business Language (UBL). 

:xCBL 4.0 (March 2003) is the latest version of xCBL. It consists of 44 business documents in eight categories.

== Use ==

As an XML document standard, xCBL is used primarily in B2B procurement tools for buyers, order and invoice management tools for suppliers and document routing tools for public and private marketplaces.

For xCBL message transport, Commerce One created an envelope messaging standard called MML (Marketsite Messaging Layer) based on the SMTP MIME format to provide both payload (xCBL) and attachment support.

<text>Kazimierz Julian Kutz (16 February 1929 – 18 December 2018) was a Polish film director, author, journalist and politician, one of the representatives of the Polish Film School and a deputy speaker of the Senate of Poland.

== Biography ==

Kazimierz Kutz was born on 16 February 1929 in Szopienice, since 1960 district of Katowice, to a railway worker and a former partisan of the Silesian Uprisings. After the World War II Kutz graduated from gymnasium in Mysłowice and in 1949 was admitted to the Łódź Film School. After finishing his studies in 1954 he started working as an assistant to Andrzej Wajda.

His film debut was &quot;Krzyż Walecznych&quot; (1959). Since then he finished more than 20 pictures, including six about his home region - Silesia. He is also famous for directing theatre plays on some of the most prominent scenes of Poland, including National Stary Theatre in Kraków and National Theatre in Warsaw, as well as several plays for the Polish television. In 1972, he founded the Silesia Film Company in Katowice and, until 1978, was its Artistic Director.

In the 1970s he became the main director of the Polish Television branch in Katowice. He was also working for several branch and cultural organisations. After the Martial Law had been imposed in Poland in 1981 Kutz was interned by the communist authorities, but was released soon afterwards. Between 1981 and 1983, lectured in the Radio and Television Faculty at Silesian University in Katowice, and, between 1985 and 1991, taught directing at the Higher Theatre School in Kraków. Since 1987, was Principal Director in the Polish Television Centre in Katowice and, between 1990 and 1991, headed the Centre. After the peaceful transition to democracy in 1989 Kutz became the head of the Polish TV branch in Kraków (until 1991).

For his involvement in the matters of Silesia, and for his films depicting the traditions and problems of that part of Poland, he was considered by some the spokesman of all Silesians. In a plebiscite organised by Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper he was chosen the third most famous Silesian ever and the first among the people living at the time. In 1997 he was awarded with the title of doctor honoris causa by the University of Opole. He was a promoter and patron of several Silesia-based cultural feasts and societies, including the &quot;Festiwal Filmów Kultowych&quot;, &quot;Festiwal Sztuki Reżyserskiej&quot;, &quot;Cultural Congress of the Upper Silesia&quot;, &quot;Council of Culture of the Silesian Voivodship&quot;, Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice () and &quot;Committee for the Construction of Silesian Museum&quot;. He was also one of the supporters of development of the Silesian language.

His 1995 film &quot;Reverted&quot; was entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1997 Kutz took part in the elections to the Senate of Poland (from the list of Freedom Union party, Katowice constituency) and was supported by approximately 500,000 Silesians. In 2001 he was elected for his second term as a non-partisan candidate, and in 2005 re-elected for the third term. Recently, he was the deputy speaker of the Senate of Poland. For his social involvements he was awarded with many of the highest Polish awards.

Kazimierz Kutz was married to Iwona and had two sons (Gabriel and Tymoteusz) and two daughters (Wiktoria and Kamila).

<doc id="1248911" wikidata="Q312324" url="?curid=1248911" title="Giuseppe Di Stefano">
<text>Giuseppe Di Stefano (24 July 19213 March 2008) was an Italian operatic tenor who sang professionally from the mid-1940s until the early 1990s. Called &quot;Pippo&quot; by both fans and friends, he was known as the &quot;Golden Voice&quot; or &quot;The Most Beautiful Voice&quot;, as the true successor of Beniamino Gigli.
Luciano Pavarotti said he modeled himself after Di Stefano. In an interview Pavarotti said &quot;Di Stefano is my idol. &quot;There&quot; is a solar voice...It was the most incredible, open voice you could hear. The musicality of Di Stefano is as natural and beautiful as the voice is phenomenal&quot;. Di Stefano was also the tenor who most inspired José Carreras. He died on 3 March 2008 as a result of injuries from an attack by unknown assailants.
== Early life and musical training ==

Giuseppe Di Stefano was born in Motta Sant&#x27;Anastasia, a village near Catania, Sicily, in 1921. He moved to Milan with his parents when he was six. He was the only son of a carabiniere turned cobbler and his dressmaker wife. Di Stefano was educated at a Jesuit seminary and briefly contemplated entering the priesthood.

When he was 16, he burst into song after losing a game of cards, and the friend with whom he was playing said he must get his voice trained. Two years later he began studying in earnest with the baritones Luigi Montesanto and Mariano Stabile, the latter impressing on the young tenor the importance of clear diction, advice he readily followed.

World War Two interrupted Di Stefano&#x27;s early career as he had to join the Italian army, where he often entertained the troops with his singing. He was considered such a bad soldier that his commanding officer decided that he would better serve his country by leaving the forces in order to sing. He performed under the pseudonym Nino Florio until Italy was defeated, when he fled to Switzerland. After a period of internment he was allowed to sing on Lausanne Radio, where he made the first of his recordings, disclosing a tenor voice of decided beauty and a singer with personality. He recorded many of his native Sicilian songs, records of which first brought him to the attention of discerning ears outside Italy in the late 1940s.

== Career ==

He began his career as a lyric tenor, notable in roles such as Nemorino in Donizetti&#x27;s L&#x27;Elisir d&#x27;Amore and Alfredo in Verdi&#x27;s La Traviata. He made his New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera in February 1948 as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; after singing the role in Riccione with Hjördis Schymberg in August of the previous year. After his performance in &quot;Manon&quot; a month later, &quot;Musical America&quot; wrote that Di Stefano &quot;had the rich velvety sound we have seldom heard since the days of Gigli&quot;. He went on to perform regularly in New York for many years. In 1957, Di Stefano made his British debut at the Edinburgh Festival as Nemorino in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and his Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, debut in 1961, as Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;.

As a singer, Di Stefano was admired for his excellent diction, unique timbre, passionate delivery and, in particular, for the sweetness of his soft singing. In his Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast debut in &quot;Faust&quot;, he attacked the high C forte and then softened to a pianissimo. Sir Rudolf Bing said in his memoirs, &quot;The most spectacular single moment in my observation year had come when I heard his diminuendo on the high C in &quot;&quot; in &quot;Faust&quot;: I shall never as long as I live forget the beauty of that sound&quot;.

During his years of international celebrity, Di Stefano won a gold Orfeo, an Italian musical award.

In 1953 Walter Legge, leader of EMI&#x27;s classical wing, wanted a tenor to record all the popular Italian operas with Maria Callas, and chose Di Stefano. Among their recording achievements was the famous 1953 studio recording of &quot;Tosca&quot; under Victor de Sabata, which is considered &quot;as being one of the great performances in the history of the gramophone&quot;. The two also performed together on stage frequently, from 1951 in South America to the end of 1957 in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; at La Scala, the last time the two collaborated in an opera. He sang Alfredo in the famous Visconti production of &quot;La traviata&quot; in 1955 at La Scala, as well as Edgardo to her Lucia under Herbert von Karajan at La Scala, Berlin and Vienna. Rudolf Bing of the Metropolitan Opera House lamented Di Stefano&#x27;s playboy lifestyle, which he felt was the cause of his vocal decline, although Di Stefano himself blamed allergies to synthetic fibres for permanently damaging his vocal cords.

In 1973, Di Stefano and Maria Callas went together for a recital tour that ended in 1974: critics remarked that Maria Callas had lost her voice, but the public reaction was nevertheless enthusiastic everywhere. It was during this period that there were rumors of a brief romantic relationship between the two singers. 
Di Stefano continued to sing successfully and his final operatic role was as the Emperor in &quot;Turandot&quot;, in July 1992.

=== Private life and death ===

In 1949 he married the conservatory student Maria Girolami in New York, with whom he had three children. The pair separated in 1976. In 1977 he began a new romantic relationship with Monika Curth, an operetta soprano originally from Hamburg, whom he married in 1993.

His last public appearance was on 24 October 2004 in Oderzo to receive an award.

On 3 December 2004, he was seriously injured during a robbery at his home in Diani Beach in Kenya by unknown assailants who left him on the ground bloodied and unconscious. After being admitted to a hospital in Mombasa, his condition proved to be more serious than it had appeared at first. After undergoing at least three operations, he went into a coma on 7 December. On 23 December, he was transferred to Italy, where he was hospitalised in Milan. Eventually he awoke from the coma, but his health never fully improved. He died in his home in Santa Maria Hoè, north of Milan, on 3 March 2008 at the age of 86.

== Vocal and singing style ==
Di Stefano was a lyric tenor with a soft voice, an unmistakable warm and rich timbre and, at least in the early years, was very expansive. He was admired for his vocal skills, clear diction, passionate phrasing, captivating interpretation and the exquisite lightness of pianissimo and shades. Far from the studious precision and &quot;aplomb&quot; of a Bjorling or a Kraus, or the vocal overpowering of a Del Monaco or stylistic rigour of a Bergonzi, Di Stefano had a natural musicality, with a generous, instinctive and communicative style of singing.

Di Stefano can be placed in the tradition of tenori lirici post-romantic of the Italian and French repertoire, where he gave memorable performances especially in the first part of his career (Rigoletto, La traviata, La bohème, The pearl fishermen, Manon, &quot;Faust&quot;). In the following years he developed into roles of the lyrical repertoire, with more drive and drama (Tosca, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, Turandot, Carmen, up to Pagliacci and Andrea Chénier).

==Recordings with Maria Callas==
Di Stefano and Maria Callas recorded many operas together, all of which for EMI. Together they recorded the following complete operas:

*&quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; – 1953
*&quot;I puritani&quot; – 1953
*&quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; – 1953
*&quot;Tosca&quot; – 1953
*&quot;Pagliacci&quot; – 1954
*&quot;Rigoletto&quot; – 1955
*&quot;Il trovatore&quot; – 1956
*&quot;La bohème&quot; – 1956
*&quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; – 1956
*&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; – 1957

A series of duets with Di Stefano and Callas was recorded by the Philips label in the period November–December 1972, with Antonio de Almeida conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. These recordings were not published officially, but a &#x27;pirate&#x27; version did appear.

==Other recordings==
Di Stefano also made many other recordings with other wonderful singers, complete EMI sets of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (opposite Victoria de los Ángeles, 1954) and &quot;La traviata&quot; (with Antonietta Stella and Tito Gobbi, 1955).

For English Decca he recorded &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; with Hilde Gueden and Fernando Corena (1955), &quot;La Gioconda&quot; (with Zinka Milanov and Leonard Warren, 1957), &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (1958) and &quot;Tosca&quot; (with Leontyne Price and Giuseppe Taddei, Herbert von Karajan conducting, 1962).

For Ricordi (Ricordi MRO 104/105), he made a complete stereo &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; with Renata Scotto, Ettore Bastianini and Ivo Vinco in 1958, with Nino Sanzogno conducting the Orchestra and Chorus of La Scala, Milan.

In 1995, VAI issued an approved version of &quot;La bohème&quot;, from a 1959 performance in New Orleans, with the tenor starring opposite Licia Albanese, Audrey Schuh, Giuseppe Valdengo and Norman Treigle. Additionally, in 1962 the tenor recorded excerpts from Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, with Anna Moffo, conducted by René Leibowitz.

In 1951, Di Stefano sang in a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, at Carnegie Hall, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, the other soloists being Herva Nelli, Fedora Barbieri and Cesare Siepi. It was released as a recording by RCA.

<text>Charles Kirk Clarke (1857 – 20 January 1924) was a psychiatrist who was influential in Canadian politics.

==Early life==
Clarke was born on 16 February 1857 in Elora, Canada West, son of a prominent Ontario parliamentarian.

==Career==
Clarke graduated from University of Toronto in 1879 and went on to found the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now the Canadian Mental Health Association) in 1914 with Clarence Hincks.

As Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at University of Toronto, he oversaw creation of the Department of Psychiatry, and development of the medical school.

Clarke first practised psychiatry at the 999 Queen Street institution in Toronto, Ontario. In 1880, then took a post at the Hamilton, Ontario asylum.

Clarke was a student and brother-in-law of Joseph Workman, Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. Clarke was an early proponents of eugenics, emphasizing the importance of restrictive laws that would limit the immigration and marriage of the &quot;mentally defective.&quot; To them, such laws seemed necessary to stem the explosive growth of state and provincial mental asylums where foreign-born patients made up more than 50 percent of the hospital population. Further, the growth of hereditarian views in science supported eugenic proposals; psychiatry&#x27;s desire for greater respectability in the medical profession made eugenic &quot;science&quot; attractive. By 1905, Clarke had abandoned the movement, and many of the other leading psychiatrists would follow suit by the end of World War I, when it was clear that eugenic measures were not having the desired effects.

Clarke joined his other brother-in-law, William Metcalfe at the Rockwood Asylum for the Criminally Insane, the psychiatric hospital in Kingston in 1881 and began a series of reforms in the care of the insane. One of these was freeing patients from confinement. On 13 August 1885, a paranoid patient attacked them both and killed Metcalfe. Clarke survived and succeeded his brother-in-law as Medical superintendent of facility. Clarke carried on in Kingston until 1905 when he succeeded Daniel Clark as superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. In 1911 he resigned from government service and was appointed superintendent of the Toronto General Hospital.

==Family==
Clarke was married to Margaret DeVeber (from 1880 until her death in 1902) with whom he had four sons and two daughters. Three of his sons were active as ice hockey players on professional or amateur levels in Canada and the United States. Charles Marshall Clarke (1881–1940) played with the Kingston Frontenacs and the Queen&#x27;s University team in Kingston, Ontario, and with the New York Athletic Club and the New York Wanderers in the AAHL, Harold Metcalfe Clarke (1885–1924) played with the Kingston Frontenacs, the University of Toronto, and with the New York Athletic Club, and Herbert Secord Clarke (1887–1938) played with the Kingston Frontenacs, the University of Toronto, and with the Cobalt Silver Kings of the National Hockey Association.

From 1904 until his death in 1924 Clarke was married to Theresa Gallagher.

==End of life==
Clarke became ill in the autumn of 1923 and died in Toronto early the next year. A headline in the Toronto Sunday World of 23 March 1924 read &quot;Canada owes immeasurable debt to Dr. C.K. Clarke who helped to lift the shadow of misery and hopelessness from insane asylums&quot;. The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto, Ontario, Canada was named in his honour.

<text>Seigmen (formed in 1989 in Tønsberg, Vestfold, Norway) is a Norwegian alternative rock band who came into prominence in the early 1990s. The band&#x27;s name is derived from Norwegian sweets brand Laban Seigmenn. The band went from a hard-edged grunge-like style to a more dynamic sound with more ambient parts and use of synthesizers and various audio-effects.

==History==
The band was formed in Tønsberg, Norway, in 1989. Økshoff and Møklebust started a band with the name Klisne Seigmenn having their first gig at the “Julerock” (“Christmas rock”) event in Tønsberg on December 27, 1989. In 1990, Christensen, Ljung and Ronthi joined the band. They recorded several studio albums, including two with American producer Sylvia Massy in Los Angeles. After a farewell tour they split, relocated to Los Angeles and formed Zeromancer in January 2000.

Seigmen reunited during the UKA-festival in Trondheim on October 20, 2005, and decided in November 2005 to do even more reunion gigs in Norway: there were seven shows in February 2006. Having great success with the reunion tour, they did six more gigs at various festivals across Norway during summer 2006, mostly as the headlining act. Media reports that summer said that Seigmen did not rule out another reunion some time in the future. In early 2008 it was announced that Seigmen would again play live, which they did on June 21 the Oslo Opera House, as one of the shows celebrating the opening of the new Opera House in Oslo. Selling out the show quickly, a second concert was set up the day after. In 2013 they contributed to the book &quot;Think like a rockstar&quot; Tenk som en rockestjerne, by Ståle Økland.
Seigmen released a new album Enola in 2015.

==Members==
* Kim Ljung (bass guitar, vocals)
* Alex Møklebust (main vocals)
* Noralf Ronthi (percussion)
* Marius Roth Christensen (guitar, vocals)
* Sverre Økshoff (guitar)

Møklebust, Ljung and Ronthi formed the band Zeromancer in 2000. Ljung also has a solo project under the name Ljungblut.

<text>Nathan Augustus Cobb (30 June 1859 – 4 June 1932) is known as &quot;the father of nematology in the United States&quot;.

He provided the foundations for nematode taxonomy and described over 1000 different nematode species. His technical innovations in nematological methods included fixation and preservation techniques; the Cobb metal mounting slide; improvements in photography and microscopic equipment; and the first device to use flotation to remove nematodes from soil. An individual with a variety of skills, he made significant contributions to a number of scientific disciplines and the USDA Nematology Laboratory, originally established with him as the director, continues today.

He was the father of Frjeda Blanchard, the geneticist who first demonstrated Mendelian inheritance in reptiles.

<text>Petrićevac is a part of the city of Banja Luka in Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today there are about 25,000 inhabitants in Petrićevac.

The place is the location of a Roman Catholic church of Saint Anthony and a Franciscan monastery in the 20th century. There was also a Serbian Orthodox Church built by Ilija Rankić.

== History ==
During World War II, the Orthodox church was destroyed in 1941 by the Ustaša fascist organization. Miroslav Filipović originated from the Catholic monastery before he went on to join the Ustaše during World War II, and commit numerous atrocities and war crimes over the Serbs in the region between 1942 and 1945. Filipović was defrocked after a February 1942 massacre of Serb civilians in the nearby villages (Drakulić and Motike).
During the war in Bosnia in 1995, as the part of persecution and ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population of the city of Banja Luka and the surrounding settlements, the Catholic Church and the monastery experienced the same fate as the 16 mosques of the city of Banja Luka which were destroyed by the Serbs already in 1993 (List of 16 destroyed mosques in Banja Luka [:bs:Spisak_džamija_u_Banjoj_Luci]). The Catholic Church and the monastery were destroyed in revenge by the Bosnian Serb Army, causing the death of one of the friars in the process. The reconstruction of the buildings started in 2003 after Pope John Paul II visited the site.

<text>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person who is exposed to alcohol during gestation. FASD affects 1 in 20 Americans, but is highly mis- and under-diagnosed.

The several forms of the condition (in order of most severe to least severe) are: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). Other terms used are fetal alcohol effects (FAE), partial fetal alcohol effects (PFAE), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and static encephalopathy, but these terms have fallen out of favor and are no longer considered part of the spectrum.
Not all infants exposed to alcohol in utero will have detectable FASD or pregnancy complications. The risk of FASD increases with amount consumed, the frequency of consumption, and the longer duration of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, particularly binge drinking. The variance seen in outcomes of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is poorly understood. Diagnosis is based on an assessment of growth, facial features, central nervous system, and alcohol exposure by a multi-disciplinary team of professionals. The main criteria for diagnosis of FASD is nervous system damage and alcohol exposure, with FAS including congenital malformations of the lips and growth deficiency. FASD is often misdiagnosed as or comorbid with ADHD.
Almost all experts recommend that the mother abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy to prevent FASDs. As the woman may not become aware that she has conceived until several weeks into the pregnancy, it is also recommended to abstain while attempting to become pregnant. Although the condition has no known cure, treatment can improve outcomes. Treatment needs vary but include psychoactive medications, behavioral interventions, tailored accommodations, case management, and public resources.

Globally, one in 10 women drink alcohol during pregnancy, and the prevalence of having any FASD disorder is estimated to be at least 1 in 20. The rates of alcohol use, FAS, and FASD are likely to be underestimated, because of the difficulty in making the diagnosis and the reluctance of clinicians to label children and mothers. Some have argued that the FAS label stigmatizes alcohol use, while authorities point out that the risk is real. The condition has appeared in several works of fiction.
==Signs and symptoms==

The key signs of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) required for diagnosis include:
* Growth deficiency or failure to thrive: slow fetal growth low birth weight or height, small head circumference (microcephaly)
* Congenital malformations of lips: short palpebral fissure lengths, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip.
* Nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, or functional impairment

Popova et al. identified 428 ICD-10 conditions as co-occurring in individuals with FAS. Excluding conditions used in FAS diagnosis, co-occurring conditions with 50% prevalence or greater include:
* Conduct disorder, behavioral problems, disruptive behavior, or impulsivity
* Developmental language disorder
* Hearing loss
* Visual impairment, including blindness or astigmatism
* Developmental delay, cognitive disorder, or mental deficiency
* Premature birth
* Substance dependence
* Congenital malformation of retina
* Congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae or cervical spine fusion
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or otherwise impaired attention
* Small eye openings (blepharophimosis), or an abnormally increased distance between the eyes, or both (hypertelorism)

Other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS where the central nervous system shows clinical deficits. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the &quot;FAS face&quot; that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as ADHD or oppositional defiance disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an ICD or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage. Many indications of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are developmental. Therefore, although a child may appear &#x27;normal&#x27; at birth, intellectual disabilities caused by alcohol before birth may not appear until the child begins school.

More broadly, alcohol use during pregnancy is also associated with:
* Intellectual disability, both in overall IQ measurements and in many functional tests
* Fetal mortality, such as spontaneous abortion (Miscarriage), stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome
* Domestic violence and potential harm to the infant
* Sleep and sucking problems as a baby
* Heart: A heart murmur that frequently disappears by one year of age. Ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, or cardiac rhythm dysfunction.
* Bones: Joint anomalies including abnormal position and function, altered palmar crease patterns, small distal phalanges, and small fifth fingernails.
* Kidneys: Horseshoe, aplastic, dysplastic, or hypoplastic kidneys.
* Eyes: Strabismus, optic nerve hypoplasia (which may cause light sensitivity, decreased visual acuity, or involuntary eye movements).
* Cleft lip with or without a cleft palate: Alcohol is known to be a folic acid antagonist, and a baby&#x27;s palate and lip develop during the first trimester of the pregnancy (first 12 weeks). Heavy alcohol consumption and binge drinking during this time have been linked to orofacial cleft.
* Occasional problems: ptosis of the eyelid, microphthalmia, webbed neck, short neck, radioulnar synostosis, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus.

Alcohol can also harm the fertility of women who are planning for pregnancy. Adverse effects of alcohol can lead to malnutrition, seizures, vomiting and dehydration. The mother can suffer from anxiety and depression which can result in child abuse/neglect. It has also been observed that when the pregnant mother withdraws from alcohol, its effects are visible on the infant as well. The baby remains in an irritated mood, cries frequently, does not sleep properly, weakening of sucking ability and increased hunger.

In 2019, a study found that individuals with FASD have a higher risk of hypertension independent of race/ethnicity and obesity.

==Causes==
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by alcohol exposure during gestational development. If an individual was not exposed to alcohol before birth, they will not have FASD. However, not all infants exposed to alcohol in utero will have detectable FAS, FASD, or pregnancy complications.

=== Exposure limit ===

No safe level of fetal alcohol exposure has been established. Because alcohol is a known teratogen, it is considered unethical to do randomized controlled trials on pregnant women to determine the precise toxicity effects of alcohol. Among women who consume any quantity of alcohol during pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to a child with FASD is about 15%, and to a child with FAS about 1.5%. Drinking 2 standard drinks a day, or 6 standard drinks in a short time, carries a 4.3% risk of a FAS birth (i.e. one of every 23 heavy-drinking pregnant women will deliver a child with FAS). Furthermore, alcohol-related congenital abnormalities occur at an incidence of roughly one out of 67 women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. Among those mothers who have an alcohol use disorder, an estimated one-third of their children have FAS. The variance seen in outcomes of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is poorly understood. Aggravating factors may include advanced maternal age, smoking, poor diet, genetics, and social risk factors.

The risk of FASD increases with amount consumed, the frequency of consumption, and longer duration of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Blood alcohol concentration has been identified as a relevant factor. All forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk. Binge drinking increases the chances and severity of FASD to such an extent that Svetlana Popova has stated that &quot;binge drinking is the direct cause of FAS or FASD&quot;. Small amounts of alcohol may not cause an abnormal appearance, however, small amounts of alcohol consumption while pregnant may cause behavioral problems and also increases the risk of miscarriage. Quasi-experimental studies provide moderately strong evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure causes detrimental cognitive outcomes, and some evidence of reduced birthweight, although no study was fully rated at low risk of bias and quantity of studies was limited.

The evidence is inconsistent and contradictory regarding the effects of low-to-moderate drinking, for example less than 12 grams of ethanol per day. Many studies find no significant effect, but some find beneficial associations, and others find detrimental associations, even on the same outcomes. Summarizing studies by country shows some similarity in results, due to using the same data sources. The definition of low alcohol consumption varies significantly among studies and often fails to incorporate all aspects of timing, dose, and duration. Recall bias and socioeconomic and psychosocial factors have been controlled for in most studies, but it is likely that residual confounding due to missing factors and variation in methods still exists and is larger than any observed effects.

===Paternal Alcohol Use===
Fathers who consume alcohol prior to conception may contribute to FAS through long term epigenetic modification of the father&#x27;s sperm.

== Prevention and stigma ==
Almost all experts recommend that the mother abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy to prevent FASDs. A pregnant woman may not become aware that she has conceived until several weeks into the pregnancy, so it is also recommended to abstain from alcohol while attempting to become pregnant. The recommendations of abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy and while attempting to become have been made by the Surgeon General of the United States, the Centers for Disease Control, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization, the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and many others. In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act.

=== Stigma ===
The most current advocacy perspectives encourage people and systems to approach FASD with interventions and support for individuals who are already living with FASD. Focusing on prevention often only further stigmatizes individuals with FASD and their birth parents. Advocates say, if a person is supporting people currently living with FASD then that person is spreading the awareness needed for successful prevention efforts; &quot;Intervention is Prevention&quot;. Many social determinants of health impact the effects of PAE:
* Genetics
* Poverty/Access to nutritious food
* Malnutrition
* Poor social support networks
* Lack of personal autonomy
* Access to healthcare
* Generational and sociocultural traumas
* Access to mental health care and treatment

=== Medication ===

Women can experience serious symptoms that accompany alcohol withdrawal during pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization, these symptoms can be treated during pregnancy with brief use of benzodiazepine tranquilizers. Currently, the FDA has approved three medications—naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram—for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, there is insufficient data regarding the safety of these medications for pregnant women.

* Naltrexone is a nonselective opioid antagonist that is used to treat AUD and opioid use disorder. The long-term effects of naltrexone on the fetus are currently unknown. Animal studies show that naltrexone administered during pregnancy increases the incidence of early fetal loss; however, there are insufficient data available to identify the extent to which this is a risk in pregnant women.
* Acamprosate functions as both an antagonist of NMDA and glutamate and an agonist at GABAA receptors, although its molecular mechanism is not completely understood. Acamprosate has been shown to be effective at preventing alcohol relapse during abstinence. Animal data, however, suggests that acamprosate can have possible teratogenic effects on fetuses.
* Disulfiram prevents relapse by blocking the metabolism of acetaldehyde after consumption of alcohol which leads to headache, nausea, and vomiting. Some evidence suggests that disulfiram use during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations such as reduction defects and cleft palate. Additionally, the effects of disulfiram can involve hypertension which can be harmful to both the pregnant woman and the fetus.

American Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend that medications not be used to treat alcohol use disorder in pregnant women except in cases of acute alcohol withdrawals or other co-existing conditions. Instead, behavioral interventions are usually preferred as treatments for pregnant women with AUD. Medications should only be used for pregnant women after carefully considering potential risks and harms of the medications versus the benefits of alcohol cessation.

==Mechanism==
After a pregnant woman consumes alcohol, the alcohol crosses through the placenta and umbilical cord to the developing fetus. Alcohol metabolizes slowly in the fetus and remains for a long time when compared to an adult. A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption:
# The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is practically absent with respect to ethanol.
# The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised.
# Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose. For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the liver, whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage. Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the fetus remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like SOD, glutathione transferases, and glutathione peroxidases, resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.

Although alcohol is known to be a teratogen (causing birth defects), the exact biological mechanisms for the development of FAS or FASD are unknown. However, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification. Genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of long-lasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific; with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations. Additionally, ethanol may alter fetal development by interfering with retinoic acid signaling as acetaldehyde can compete with retinaldehyde and prevents its oxidation to retinoic acid.

===Developmental stages===
Different body systems in the infant grow, mature and develop at specific times during gestation. The effect of consumption of alcohol differs during each of these developmental stages:
* From conception and to the third week, the most susceptible systems and organs are the brain, spinal cord, and heart. The effects of alcohol consumption early in the pregnancy can result in defects to these systems and organs.
* During the third week, alcohol can also damage the central nervous system of the fetus.
* During the fourth week of gestation, the limbs are being formed and it is at this point that alcohol can affect the development of arms, legs, fingers and toes. The eyes and ears also form during the fourth week and are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol.
* By the sixth week of gestation, the teeth and palate are forming and alcohol consumption at this time will affect these structures. Alcohol use in this window is responsible for many of the facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome.
* During the twelfth week, frequent alcohol exposure can negatively impact the brain development which affects cognitive, learning and behavioral skills before birth.
* By the 20th week of gestation the formation of organs and organ systems is well-developed. The infant is still susceptible to the damaging effects of alcohol.
* Ethanol exposure in the second trimester reduces nutrition levels and can affect the functioning of the endocrine system in both fetus and mother. This is because blood flow via umbilical artery to fetal brain is reduced.

==Diagnosis==
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders encompass a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems which can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms in the person and evidence of alcohol use. These diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are currently recognized:
* Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
* Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS.
* Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)
* Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE)

As of 2016, the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services accepts only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types. The agency feels it is unclear if identifying a FASD-related condition benefits the diagnosed individual.

===Classification===
Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:
* The Institute of Medicine&#x27;s guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure;
* The University of Washington&#x27;s &quot;The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot;, which ranks the four key features of FASD on a Likert scale of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings;
* The Centers for Disease Control&#x27;s &quot;Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis&quot;, which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions; and
* Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington&#x27;s systems.

Each diagnostic system requires an assessment of four key features: growth, facial features, central nervous system, and alcohol exposure. To determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.

A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS, and the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, there are differences among systems when full criteria for FAS are not met. Prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis in all FASD systems. But different researchers and systems may use a wide variety of terminology to describe an individual&#x27;s FASD condition, as the nomenclature is still evolving. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions. The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.

====Fetal alcohol syndrome====
The most severe condition is called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis. The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:

# Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile
# All three FAS facial features present
# Clinically significant structural, neurological, &quot;or&quot; functional impairment of the central nervous system
# Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure

FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis.

====Partial FAS====
Partial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot;. People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but &quot;look&quot; less like FAS.

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:

# Two or three FAS facial features present
# Clinically significant structural, neurological, &quot;or&quot; functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains
# Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure

Growth or height may range from normal to deficient.

====Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder====
Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) is the specific diagnosis of the non-dysmorphic type of FASD, where a majority of the symptoms are witnessed. The diagnosis was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the terms FAE (fetal alcohol effects). It focuses on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:

# Minimal or no FAS facial features present
# Clinically significant structural, neurological, &quot;or&quot; functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains
# Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure

Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient.

====Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure====
Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE) is the spectrum-wide term for the psychiatric, behavioral, and neurological symptoms of all FASDs. It was introduced into the DSM-V as a &quot;condition for further study&quot; and as a specified condition under, &quot;other specified neurodevelopmental disorders&quot; as a way to better study the behavioral aspects of all FASD disorders.

===Specific criteria===
====Growth====
In terms of FASD, growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a premature infant), and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements. Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population. Prenatal or postnatal presentation of growth deficits can occur, but are most often postnatal.

Criteria for FASD are least specific in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) diagnostic system (&quot;low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height&quot; p. 4 of executive summary), while the CDC use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency. The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile. Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy.

The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; from 2004 ranks growth deficiency as follows:
* Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile.
* Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both.
* Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles.
* None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile.

In the initial studies that described FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome. That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. Growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage. Canadian guidelines updated in 2016 deleted growth as a diagnostic criterion.

====Facial features====

Several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS. The presence of FAS facial features indicates brain damage, although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th to 20th week of gestation.

Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features which distinguish FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics. The three FAS facial features are:
* A smooth philtrum: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Thin vermilion: The upper lip thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Small palpebral fissures: Eye width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.

Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide, a five-point Likert scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.

Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:
* Severe: All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average).
* Moderate: Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip &quot;or&quot; philtrum ranked at 3, &quot;or&quot; PFL between one and two standard deviations below average).
* Mild: A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations:
** Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits,
** One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or
** One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits.
* None: All three facial features ranked within normal limits.

====Central nervous system====
Central nervous system (CNS) damage is the primary feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother. While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments.

All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a &quot;complex pattern&quot; of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND. The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND. The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse. The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks:
* Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy.
* Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains.
* Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains &quot;or&quot; by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed.
* Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage.

=====Structural=====
Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).

Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts. Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly.

Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely.

During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of brain cells, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain. During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well.

As of 2002, there were 25 reports of autopsies on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth. The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere.

In 1977, Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.

=====Neurological=====
When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as meningitis, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc.

All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.

Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, and poor eye–hand coordination. Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, while others are determined through clinical judgment. &quot;Clinical judgment&quot; is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both.

=====Functional=====
When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments. Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.

The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis:
* Evidence of a complex pattern of behavior or cognitive abnormalities inconsistent with developmental level in the following CNS domains – Sufficient for a pFAS or ARND diagnosis using IOM guidelines
** Learning disabilities, academic achievement, impulse control, social perception, communication, abstraction, math skills, memory, attention, judgment
* Performance at two or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS, pFAS or static encephalopathy diagnosis using 4-Digit Diagnostic Code
** Executive functioning, memory, cognition, social/adaptive skills, academic achievement, language, motor skills, attention, activity level
* General cognitive deficits (e.g., IQ) at or below the 3rd percentile on standardized testing – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines
* Performance at or below the 16th percentile on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines
** Cognition, executive functioning, motor functioning, attention and hyperactive problems, social skills, sensory processing disorder, social communication, memory, difficulties responding to common parenting practices
* Performance at two or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using Canadian guidelines
** Cognition, communication, academic achievement, memory, executive functioning, adaptive behavior, motor skills, social skills, social communication

=====Ten brain domains=====
A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-à-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems&#x27; recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.

The proposed Ten Brain Domains include:
* Achievement
* Adaptive behavior
* Attention
* Cognition
* Executive functioning
* Language
* Memory
* Motor skills
* Multisensory integration or soft neurological problems
* Social communication

The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems&#x27; CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.

====Alcohol exposure====
Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother&#x27;s alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), chemical biomarkers, or other reliable sources.

Exposure level is assessed as &quot;confirmed exposure&quot;, &quot;unknown exposure&quot;, and &quot;confirmed absence of exposure&quot; by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The &quot;4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; further distinguishes confirmed exposure as &quot;High Risk&quot; and &quot;Some Risk&quot;:
* Confirmed exposure: The CDC guidelines are silent on using information on amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use for diagnostic purposes. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that &quot;heavy alcohol use&quot; is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period. &quot;The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code&quot; ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as &quot;high risk&quot; and &quot;some risk&quot;. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 100 mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55 kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.
** High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high blood alcohol levels (100 mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy.
** Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns.
* Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy. For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing. Many are reluctant to admit to drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.
* No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least &quot;suspected&quot; to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.

====Biomarkers====
Evidence is insufficient for the use of chemical biomarkers to detect prenatal alcohol exposure. Biomarkers being studied include fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in the meconium (first feces of an infant) and hair. FAEE may be present if chronic alcohol exposure occurs during the second and third trimester since this is when the meconium begins to form. Concentrations of FAEE can be influence by medication use, diet, and individual genetic variations in FAEE metabolism however.

===Differential diagnosis===
The CDC reviewed nine syndromes that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure:
* Aarskog syndrome
* Williams syndrome
* Noonan syndrome
* Dubowitz syndrome
* Brachman-DeLange syndrome
* Toluene syndrome
* Fetal hydantoin syndrome
* Fetal valproate syndrome
* Maternal PKU fetal effects

Other disorders that have overlapping behavioral symptoms that might be comorbid to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder might include:
* Attention deficit hyperactive disorder
* Autism spectrum disorder
* Reactive attachment disorder
* Oppositional defiant disorder
* Sensory integration dysfunction
* Bipolar disorder
* Depression

Most people with an FASD have most often been misdiagnosed with ADHD due to the large overlap between their behavioral deficits.

==Treatment==
Although the condition has no available cure, treatment can improve outcomes. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone.

Between 2017 and 2019 researchers made a breakthrough when they discovered a possible cure using neural stem cells (NSCs); they propose that if applied to a newborn, the damage can be reversed and prevent any lasting effects in the future.

===Medications===
Psychoactive drugs are frequently tried as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably ADHD. Medications are used to specifically treat symptoms of FASDs and not FAS entirely. Some of the medications used are antidepressants, stimulants, neuroleptics and anti-anxiety drugs.

===Behavioral interventions===
Early intervention from birth to age 3 has been shown to improve the development of a child born with FASD. Interventions may include parent–child interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and drugs. Behavioral interventions are based on the learning theory, which is the basis for many parenting and professional strategies and interventions. Along with ordinary parenting styles, such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with ADHD), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person&#x27;s poor academic achievement results in special education services, which also utilizes principles of learning theory, behavior modification, and outcome-based education.

Children with FAS benefit from behavioral and functional training, social skill training and tutoring. Support groups and talk therapy not only help the children suffering from FAS, but also help the parents and siblings of these children.

===Developmental framework===
Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on developmental psychology, even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., Jean Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development, Erik Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development, John Bowlby&#x27;s attachment framework, and other developmental stage theories). FAS interferes with normal development, which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.

By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person&#x27;s developmental context into account while developing interventions.

===Advocacy model===
The advocacy model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS. Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or case manager) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.

The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an individualized education program (IEP) for the person&#x27;s progress at school.

An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a community practice level as well.

Treating FAS at the public health and public policy level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of public resources to assist those with FAS. It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during OB/GYN or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of FASD is variable depending on the type, severity, and if treatment is issued. Prognostic disabilities are divided into primary and secondary disabilities.

===Primary disabilities===
The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.

Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as &quot;behavior problems&quot;, but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty, rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability. The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but animal studies have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Representative examples include:
* Learning impairments are associated with impaired dendrites of the hippocampus
* Impaired motor development and functioning are associated with reduced size of the cerebellum
* Hyperactivity is associated with decreased size of the corpus callosum

Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include: Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties.
* Achievement: Learning disabilities
* Adaptive behavior: Poor impulse control, poor personal boundaries, poor anger management, stubbornness, intrusive behavior, too friendly with strangers, poor daily living skills, developmental delays
* Attention: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor attention or concentration, distractible
* Cognition: Intellectual disability, confusion under pressure, poor abstract skills, difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, slower cognitive processing
* Executive functioning: Poor judgment, information-processing disorder, poor at perceiving patterns, poor cause and effect reasoning, inconsistent at linking words to actions, poor generalization ability
* Language: Expressive or receptive language disorders, grasp parts but not whole concepts, lack understanding of metaphor, idioms, or sarcasm
* Memory: Poor short-term memory, inconsistent memory and knowledge base
* Motor skills: Poor handwriting, poor fine motor skills, poor gross motor skills, delayed motor skill development (e.g., riding a bicycle at appropriate age)
* Sensory processing and soft neurological problems: sensory processing disorder, sensory defensiveness, undersensitivity to stimulation
* Social communication: Intrude into conversations, inability to read nonverbal or social cues, &quot;chatty&quot; but without substance

===Secondary disabilities===
The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.

Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):
* Mental health problems: Diagnosed with ADHD, clinical depression, or other mental illness, experienced by over 90% of the subjects
* Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Trouble with the law: Charged with or convicted of a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older)

Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:
* Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)
* Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)

===Protective factors and strengths===

Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:
* Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life
* Being diagnosed with FAS before age six
* Never having experienced violence
* Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years
* Experiencing a &quot;good quality home&quot; (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old
* Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services
* Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life
* Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition)

Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:
* Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry
* Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities

===Lifespan===

One study found that the people with FAS had a significantly shorter life expectancy. With the average life span of 34 years old, a study found that 44% of the deaths were of &quot;external cause&quot;, with 15% of deaths being suicides.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, one in 10 women drink alcohol during pregnancy. Out of this population, 20% binge drink and have four or more alcoholic drinks per single occasion. The use of alcohol during pregnancy occurs at different rates across the world, potentially due to various cultural differences and legislation. The five countries with the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy are Ireland (60%), Belarus (47%), Denmark (46%), the UK (41%), and the Russian Federation (37%).

In a recent count, the prevalence of having any FASD disorder was 1 person out of 20, but some people estimate it could be as high as 1 in 7. The rates of FAS and FASD are likely to be underestimated, because of the difficulty in making the diagnosis and the reluctance of clinicians to label children and mothers.

===Australia===

FASD among Australian youth is more common in indigenous Australians. The only states that have registered birth defects in Australian youth are Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In Australia, only 12% of Australian health professionals are aware of the diagnostics and symptoms of FASD. In Western Australia, the rate of births resulting in FASD is 0.02 per 1,000 births for non-Indigenous Australians, however among indigenous births the rate is 2.76 per 1,000 births. In Victoria, there have been no registered FASD related births for indigenous Australians, but the rate for the general population in Victoria is 0.01–0.03 per 1000 births. There have been no dedicated FASD clinics within Western Australia, but there are also no nationally supported diagnostic criteria anywhere in Australia. Passive surveillance is a prevention technique used within Australia to assist in monitoring and establishing detectable defects during pregnancy and childhood.

===Canada===
A 2015 review article estimated the overall costs to Canada from FASD at $9.7 billion (including from crime, healthcare, education, etc.).

===South Africa===
In South Africa, some populations have rates as high as 9%.

===United States===
In the United States, alcohol use at some point during pregnancy is common and appears to be rising in prevalence. In 2006–2010, an estimated 7.6% of pregnant women used alcohol, while 1.4% of pregnant women reported binge drinking during their pregnancy. The highest prevalence estimates of reported alcohol use during pregnancy were among women who are aged 35–44 years (14.3%), white (8.3%), college graduates (10.0%), or employed (9.6%). In 2015, about 10% of pregnant women drank alcohol in the past month, and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy. Of pregnant American women, 3.6% met criteria for an alcohol use disorder in a 2001 epidemiological study. As of 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control estimated 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD.

FASD is estimated to affect between 1-2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1,000 live births in the United States. Using medical and other records, CDC studies have identified 0.2 to 1.5 infants with FAS for every 1,000 live births in certain areas of the United States. A more recent CDC study of 2010 data analyzed medical and other records and found FAS in 0.3 out of 1,000 children from 7 to 9 years of age.

The lifetime cost per child with FAS in the United States was estimated at $2 million (for an overall cost across the country of over $4 billion) by the CDC in 2002.

==History==
===Before designation===
Some hold that ancient sources describe the negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy, identifying admonitions from ancient Greek, Roman, the Talmud, and the Bible. For example, Plato writes in his fourth-century B.C. &quot;Laws&quot; (6.775): &quot;Drinking to excess is a practice that is nowhere seemly ... nor yet safe. ... It behooves both bride and bridegroom to be sober ... in order to ensure, as far as possible, in every case that the child that is begotten may be sprung from the loins of sober parents.&quot; The sixth-century AD Talmud (Kethuboth 60b) cautions, &quot;One who drinks intoxicating liquor will have ungainly children.&quot; However, ancient sources rarely if ever distinguish maternal alcohol consumption from paternal, and are more concerned with conception than pregnancy. The sources can often be viewed as expressing heredity, that children are likely to turn out like their (alcoholic) parents, rather than presenting the modern viewpoint that alcohol itself has an impact.
In 1725, in the midst of the Gin Craze, British physicians petitioned the House of Commons on the effects of strong drink when consumed by pregnant women saying that such drinking is &quot;too often the cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be, instead of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country&quot;. There are many other such historical references during that period. Gin specifically was implicated as affecting children&#x27;s health and causing stillbirth and infant mortality, as depicted in William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Gin Lane&quot;. In contrast, Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Beer Street&quot; shows commerce and happiness, suggesting that the alcohol in beer was not known to have deleterious effects at this time.

In Gaelic Scotland, according to Martin Martin, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

In the 19th century, Benjamin Rush and Thomas Trotter lobbied against alcohol consumption during pregnancy to avoid dependence and mental deficiency in children. The teetotalism and temperance movements popularized these and other claims, including the teratogenic effects of alcohol on animal embryos, but they were often sensationalized, so much so that any finding that alcohol was harmful was largely denounced as propaganda. A prominent observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a Liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives. He suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use. This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded. A case study by Henry H. Goddard of the Kallikak family—popular in the early 1900s—represents this earlier perspective, though later researchers have suggested that the Kallikaks almost certainly had FAS. General studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid-1900s were typically based on a heredity argument. Researchers were often temperance advocates and funded by like-minded organizations such as the Anti-Saloon League, so clinicians viewed all such research with heavy skepticism. The temperance movement effectively shut down serious research into the subject for nearly 50 years after Prohibition.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor (born at less than 37 weeks gestation). The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College. Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. &quot;Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued.&quot; Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was &quot;a brutal procedure for all involved&quot;. Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication was highly likely to contribute to FASD. In a 2015 review, ethanol was found to be no better than placebo (sugar water) in suppressing preterm birth and neonatal mortality. Not only was ethanol worse than other beta-mimetic drugs (tocolytic agents) at postponing birth, it also led to a higher rate of low birthweight babies, babies with breathing problems at birth, and neonatal death.

=== Recognition as a syndrome ===
In France in 1957, Jacqueline Rouquette had described 100 children whose parents were alcoholics in a thesis, which was not published. &quot;She gave a good description in certain cases of the facies&quot; according to her mentor, Paul Lemoine.
In 1968, Paul Lemoine of Nantes, himself published a study in a French medical journal about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics.

Independently, in the U.S., Christy Ulleland at University of Washington Medical School conducted an 18-month study in 1968–1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers. This study is arguably the true source of the modern understanding. The infants were studied by dysmorphologists Kenneth Lyons Jones and David Weyhe Smith, colleagues of Ulleland at University of Washington, who identified a pattern of &quot;craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay&quot; in eight children. The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal. They named these defects &quot;fetal alcohol syndrome&quot;. News of the discovery shocked some, while others were skeptical of the findings. While many syndromes are eponymous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms. He reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention, believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome, then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from patient education and public awareness. At the time, nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from FAS or its rate of prevalence.

In 1978, within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Sterling Clarren, had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of intellectual disability. In 1979, the Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden. Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner.

===&quot;Spectrum&quot; rather than Syndrome===
Over time, subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure. The term &quot;fetal alcohol effects&quot; (FAE) was used for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects. It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies. Smith (1981) described FAE as an &quot;extremely important concept&quot; to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features. This term fell out of favor with clinicians in the 1990s because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects could be just as detrimental. In 1996 the replacement terms ARBD and ARND were introduced. In 2002, the US Congress mandated that the CDC develop diagnostic guidelines for FAS and in 2004 a definition of a term that already had been used by some in the nineties, the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) was adopted,&gt; to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.
Currently, FAS is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and assigned ICD-9 and diagnoses.

Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE), was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE. The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD. PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association introduced neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE).

==Society and culture==
===Criminalization===
Criminalization of substance use during pregnancy because of harm to the fetus or child is fiercely debated. Elizabeth Armstrong has questioned the zero-tolerance approach taken towards alcohol consumption during pregnancy, describing it as a moral panic. While heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to be damaging to the unborn child, the effects of low intakes remain debatable, particularly in the absence of randomized controlled trials (c.f. ). The UK&#x27;s abstinence recommendation was not chosen based on scientific evidence, but rather because it was simple advice that would ensure no one underestimated the risk. Tennessee&#x27;s 2014 fetal assault law (which expired in 2016) was criticized for not addressing alcohol use. The law criminalized opioid use during pregnancy and resulted in women avoiding professional medical care for fear of prosecution. A wide variety of professional organizations oppose criminalization. Minnesota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have statutory authorization for the involuntary civil commitment of women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy.

===2016 CDC controversy===
In 2016, a CDC press release and infographic entitled &quot;More than 3 million US women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy&quot; caused controversy. The CDC release contained the message &quot;The risk is real. Why take the chance?&quot;. Darlena Cunha of Times Magazine interpreted the infographic as telling all women of child-bearing age not to drink at all, in case they might accidentally fall pregnant, and called them &quot;scare tactics&quot; and &quot;shaming recommendations&quot;. Julie Beck said that the infographic insinuated that &quot;your womb is a Schrodinger&#x27;s box and you shouldn&#x27;t pour alcohol into it unless you&#x27;ve peeked in there to be 100 percent sure the coast is clear&quot;. The CDC later clarified that the infographic was not intended to make any new guidelines or recommendations for women who are pre-pregnant, but rather to encourage conversations about alcohol with health professionals. Nonetheless, half of the pregnancies in developed countries and over 80% in developing countries are unplanned. Many women do not realize they are pregnant during the early stages and continue drinking when pregnant.

===In fiction===
In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; (where all fetuses are gestated in vitro in a factory), lower caste fetuses are created by receiving alcohol transfusions (Bokanovsky Process) to reduce intelligence and height, thus conditioning them for simple, menial tasks. Connections between alcohol and incubating embryos are made multiple times in the novel.

The main character of the 2009 film &quot;Defendor&quot; is implied to have the condition.

Tony Loneman, a character in Tommy Orange&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;There There&quot;, was born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which he calls &quot;the Drome&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Pepper was born the youngest of three boys in Campbell River, British Columbia, the son of a lumberjack. When he was five years old, his family set sail in a homemade yacht, navigating through the South Pacific islands for five years. He was educated through correspondence courses and public schools in Polynesia. His family encouraged him to entertain himself through improvisation and acting games while aboard the ship. When the family had finished their travels, they returned to Canada, settling on Denman Island, which his mother&#x27;s family had called home for five generations. He graduated from Georges P. Vanier Secondary School in 1988. Pepper attended Camosun College after receiving a scholarship for artistic achievement, studying marketing and design. He later moved to Vancouver, where he enrolled in acting classes. He spent four years studying, including at the Gastown Actors Studio, before landing a recurring role on the show &quot;Madison&quot;.

<doc id="1248936" wikidata="Q5053412" url="?curid=1248936" title="Cathy Davis">
<text>Cathy Davis (born c. 1952) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1976 and 1981. Some of her fights were fixed.

==Career==
Davis sued the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) in 1977 because she was denied a boxing license because she was a woman, and the case was decided in her favor later that year, with the judge 
invalidating New York State rule number 205.15, which stated, “No woman may be licensed as a boxer or second or licensed to compete in any wrestling exhibition with men.” In his opinion the judge cited the precedent set by &quot;Garrett v. New York State Athletic Commission&quot; (1975), which “found the regulation invalid under the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions”. The NYSAC filed an appeal of the ruling, but later dropped it.

In August 1978 Davis became the first, and, until Ronda Rousey in January 2016, the only woman to be on the cover of &quot;The Ring&quot;.

On September 19, 1978, Davis received the NYSAC’s first boxing license given to a female boxer.

Cat Davis did not only fight in New York. She fought between 1976 and 1981, in various areas of the country, including Nevada, California, and much of the Northwest. She became popular throughout the country by often fighting on television.

It was eventually revealed that some of her fights had been fixed.

==Partial boxing record==
Officially, her first fight occurred on November 11, 1977, when she knocked out Margie Dunson in the first round, in North Carolina. On June 7, 1978, she and Ernestine Jones fought to a no contest in a bout that was scheduled for four rounds. On July 2, 1979, she knocked out Uschi Doering in the Exposition Building, in Portland, Maine, in 6 rounds.

<doc id="1248937" wikidata="Q7435779" url="?curid=1248937" title="Scots College, Wellington">
<text>Scots College is an independent (private) Presbyterian school. It is located in the suburb of Strathmore Park, Wellington, New Zealand. Under the leadership of an Executive Headmaster, the College comprises three schools, the Junior School for Years 1 to 6, the Middle School for Years 7 to 10 and the Senior School for Years 11 to 13. Each school has its own Principal and Staff. Scots College is an IB World College.

==History==
It was founded as a Presbyterian boys&#x27; college in 1916 by Rev Dr James Gibb and the Hon John Aitken on the current campus of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, and moved to the present site in Strathmore in 1920. Dr Gibb&#x27;s vision was the creation of a Christian college that would be independent of the secular state system. It is the &#x27;sister&#x27; school of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, Wellington.

The college&#x27;s Scots heritage is reflected in its ceremonies (often involving a piper leading a procession into its hall) and school song. College prefects wear kilts on official occasions and every Friday for chapel. The school tartan is that of the Clan Fergusson. Permission to wear the tartan was granted by the late Governor General Sir Charles Fergusson.

In 2020, the school began a transition to co-education with girls accepted for years 11 and 12. This was extended to the remaining years in 2021–22.

The Main Block is listed by Heritage New Zealand as a Category 2 historic building.

==Houses==

Students in the Middle and Senior Schools (Years 7–13) are organised into eight &quot;houses&quot;. Each house reflects an important part of the people who have contributed to Scots College over its history. The houses have expanded three times since the founding of the school – two houses were added to the original two in 1961/1963, another two in 1993 with the boarders&#x27; house (Gibb) being removed at this time as well, and a further two added in 2009. There are major competitions in swimming, cross-country, music, athletics, and other weekly house sport games, such as hockey and touch rugby. The two original houses were Aitken (Blue, named in honour of founding father Hon John Aitken) and Fergusson (Green, named in honour of General Sir Charles Fergusson), with Glasgow (Red, named in honour of former Headmaster K W R Glasgow) and MacKenzie (Yellow, named in honour of Elsie MacKenzie, Former mistress of the Junios Department of Scots College) being established next, followed by Plimmer (Sky Blue, named in honour of the John Plimmer and his family, whose four grandchildren were enrolled as boarders in 1916) and Uttley (Black, named in honour of Scots College&#x27;s first Headmaster Dr George Uttley) in 1993 and Smith (Navy Blue, in honour of Alexander Pringle Smith) and Mawson (Maroon, named in honour of Brigadier John Mawson, a past student and Scots College Old Boys&#x27; Association President) established in 2009.

The Preparatory School (Years 1–6) maintains four houses: Potatau (Blue), Bedding (Green), Macarthur (Red) and McKelvie (Yellow). In 2004 there was an announcement of a change to the current House names in the hopes of giving the Preparatory School a better sense of historical identity; Potatau named after the writer of the School haka, McKelvie named in honour of past parent and Board of Governors member Lynn McKelvie, Bedding names in honour of past student Geoff Bedding and Macarthur named after the first student at Scots College Ian Hannay Macarthur.

==Campus facilities==
Recent projects on campus have been the science block, opened in 2006 by Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse and the Aitken (Admin/Reception) block in 2009. Other facilities updated in the last few years include the Leslie Shelly Lecture Theatre and the Information Centre, and an extension to Gibb House, the school&#x27;s Boarding House. The Hodge Sports Centre (HSC) was opened on 4 November 2011, and the Creative Performing Arts Centre (CPAC) was opened on 2 March 2012.

Opened in 2012 is a purpose built Creative and Performing Arts Centre. The Creative and Performing Arts Centre provides a new Pipe Band facility, recording studio, Drama rooms, Music rooms, Middle School administration area, offices, Art and Graphics rooms.

The College introduced Flexible Learning environments to its campus during 2017 including a tertiary style &#x27;Hub&#x27; offering flexible spaces for teaching, student collaboration and a common room for senior students. Additional new Boarding Houses were opened in 2015 and 2018 to house the growing number of boarding students.

Flexible Learning Environments have been introduced to the College over previous years. These spaces help facilitate collaboration and project based learning. They provide teachers and students with areas to learn in large and small groups, collaborate and break away for independent study.

The latest campus development is the McKinnon Block, named in honour of former Headmaster Ian McKinnon and his wife Jenny. Opened in 2020 by Her Excellency the Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy Governor General of New Zealand. Included in the building are facilities for Food Science to allow for its introduction to the curriculum. A fabrication lab with state of the art model and design equipment that brings us in alignment with leading NZ universities. The girls’ pastoral care facilities are also located in this block with their own tertiary style common room.

The school also has IB World School status and maintains an IB curriculum from PYP to Diploma. The current IB Diploma co-ordinator is Mike McKnight and the MYP co-ordinator is Kate Bondett.

==Boarding==

The boarding house (titled Gibb House, after the founder of the school) has accommodation for approximately 130 students. The majority of these students are in Years 9–13, but allowance has been made occasionally for Year 7 and 8 students to board full-time.

==Connections with other schools==
Scots College 1st XV is currently playing in the Premier I rugby division. In 2014 the 1st XV won the NZ Secondary School Championship – a joint win with Hamilton Boys High School. In 2015 they represented New Zealand at the SANIX Rugby Youth Cup tournament in Japan where they placed third.

Students competing for the 1st XV in traditional fixtures perform a special haka written by an old boy; this is distinct from the school haka.

Scots College is the brother school to the slightly younger Queen Margaret College, which now sites itself in the original Scots College building. Often there are various socials and sporting matches against local schools, organised by College Sport Wellington. In addition, both sections of the school have inter-school fixtures with other secondary schools, notably Lindisfarne and primary schools such as Huntley School.

== Co-educational ==
In August 2020 the Scots College Board of Governors announced the decision to move to a fully co-educational College from 2021. Accepting girls and boys in Years 1-13 (initially excluding Years 8 and 10). This change is part of the College&#x27;s Future Focussed Learning Strategy and preparing students for their futures in an evolving world.

In January 2018, School Headmaster Graeme Yule announced that Scots College Senior School will become a co-educational school, meaning it will accept both girls and boys to enroll. The change will begin in 2020, when 60 Year 11 to 13 female students will join the Senior School and graduate as the first mixed-sex group from 2021. The integration would expand each year to a total of 150 girls by 2022.

==Controversies==
In November 2007, several final year students were banned from end-of-year prizes for growing moustaches as part of the fund-raising campaign
&#x27;Movember&#x27;, established by The Movember Foundation, to raise awareness for prostate cancer. The college threatened to ban a senior student from their NCEA examinations (official secondary school qualification) for growing a moustache during November.

In September 2010, Scots College expelled seven students and suspended five for involvement in a drug ring within the college. Some involved in using and dealing the illegal substances were as young as 13.

In October 2013, ten Scots College students from Year 11 to 13, including prefects, were caught illegally consuming alcohol on a school trip to Fiji. School Headmaster Graeme Yule recognised the actions as &#x27;relatively minor&#x27; and suspended students for less than a week.

In April 2019, Headmaster Graham Yule was accused of making &quot;sexist&quot; comments after he said prospective female students would not be allowed to &quot;sit at the back of the class painting their nails&quot; once the school becomes co-educational. He also commented on the importance women gave to the size of mirrors while talking about construction of the new girls&#x27; bathroom.

<doc id="1248939" wikidata="Q3588193" url="?curid=1248939" title="Allouis longwave transmitter">
<text>The Allouis longwave transmitter has been France&#x27;s central longwave broadcast transmitter since 1939. It is located near the village of Allouis.
It broadcast the France Inter public radio station from October 1952 until 31 December 2016. Since 2017, it broadcasts only the TDF time signal, which has been renamed ALS162 since 2017. 

The first transmitter, built in 1939 during the Phoney War, used an aerial with four masts and a transmitter rated at 500 kilowatts. It was destroyed in 1944 during the scorched earth retreat by German forces.

On 19 October 1952 a new 250 kW transmitter came into service. This used a special cage aerial, mounted on a high earthed mast. In 1957 the transmission power was increased to 600 kW, in 1974 to 1,000 kW, and in 1981 to 2,000 kW. Transmission power was reduced to 1,000 kW during the hours of darkness. In 2011 the transmission power was reduced to 1,500 kW for cost savings. For the same reason the transmission power was reduced to 1,100 kW in 2017 and subsequently in February 2020 to 800 kW. In 2024, tests were performed at a reduced transmission power of 675 kW.

In 1974 the aerial was renewed. The cage aerials were removed and the mast height was increased to . A second mast of the same height was constructed at the same time.

In 1977, the current phase modulated time signal was added to the transmissions. The broadcast frequency, formerly 164 kHz, was changed to 163.840 kHz (the 5th harmonic of the common 32,768 Hz timekeeping frequency used by most quartz clocks) to be a more convenient frequency standard.

In 1980, the first atomic clock was installed to regulate the carrier frequency.

On 1 February 1986, the frequency was changed to its current value of 162 kHz (still an accurately controlled frequency standard) to bring it to a multiple of 9 kHz in accordance with the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975.

The radio channel France Inter announced during 2016 that the channel would discontinue transmitting on the 162 kHz frequency on 31 December 2016, seeking cost savings of approximately 6 million Euros per year. The transmission of the ALS162 time signal was and will be continued after this date, as this time signal is critical for over 300,000 devices, which are deployed within French enterprises and state entities, like the French railways SNCF, the electricity distributor ENEDIS, airports, hospitals, municipalities, et cetera.
The transmitter is owned by TéléDiffusion de France and the dissemination of the Metropolitan French national legal time to the public is a joint responsibility of ANFR (state body for radio frequencies), the trade body France Horlogerie and the LNE-SYRTE and LNE-LTFB time laboratories.

<doc id="1248945" wikidata="Q2307889" url="?curid=1248945" title="Point Pedro">
<text>Point Pedro, also known as Paruthithurai (; ) is a town, located in Jaffna District, Sri Lanka, at the northernmost point of the island.

Cotton is produced around Point Pedro in the fertile calcic red latosol soils. The eastern coast of Point Pedro forms a 3 mile wide, 20 mile long beach with sand dunes up to 100 feet high, extending to Thalayady. The porous soil has a water table deep underground with an estimated one billion litres of fresh water. The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 raised the salt content of the ground water. The tsunami destroyed parts of the town and submerged some parts with seawater up to 4 feet deep.

The town came briefly under the control of the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) during the early 1990s, until the Sri Lankan Army recaptured it in 1995.

==Etymology==
The place name of Point Pedro is a corruption of the Portuguese &quot;Ponta das Pedras&quot; meaning &quot;the rocky cape&quot;. The name of the town in Tamil is &quot;Paruthithurai&quot;, which literally mean &quot;Cotton Harbour&quot;. The harbor exported cotton to South India for centuries.

==History==

===Ancient history===
Vallipuram, a village nearby was an ancient settlement with rich archeological remains. During pre-colonial and colonial times Point Pedro was a trading port. There is a large number of people in and around Point Pedro who trace their families to local traders, called Sambangarar, &#x27;சம்பாங்காரர்&#x27; in Tamil, meaning &#x27;ship people&#x27;.

===Portuguese history===
There are several Catholic churches built around Point Pedro along the coasts and in Nelliady. Sacred Heart College is a major Catholic high school situated in Nelliady.

===Dutch colonial history===
In the 17th century Philippus Baldaeus, a Christian missionary from the Netherlands, settled in Jaffna following the Dutch occupation of Ceylon. He documented the lives and customs of the Tamil people of Northern Ceylon. His studies were published in the Netherlands and later in Germany. In Point Pedro&#x27;s market there is a stone inscription commemorating Baldeus giving lessons from the Bible under a tamarind tree. The tree was uprooted by a cyclone in 1962.

===British colonial legacy===
Wesleyan missionaries from Great Britain established schools in the area including Hartley College and the Methodist Girls High School.

There are American mission schools at Uduppiddy and Thunnalai.

==Heritage sites==
Heritage sites in Point Pedro include the lighthouse, the Vallipuram temple and St. Lourdes church of Thumpalai.

===Harbour===
Point Pedro has a small harbour, which is controlled by the Sri Lankan army. If the much-delayed and frequently re-planned Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is completed, deepening the Palk Straits between India and Sri Lanka to allow larger ships to pass, rather than having to travel around Sri Lanka, then Point Pedro and other ports in the Jaffna peninsula may see a significant increase in maritime trade, especially with India.

==Education==
Schools in the town include Hartley College, Velautham Maha Vidyalayam, Vadamarachchi Hindu Girls&#x27; College and Methodist Girls High School.
==Notable people==

* Captain Mayuran (Saba)–LTTE member and special bodyguard to leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.

<doc id="1248947" wikidata="Q599968" url="?curid=1248947" title="Kaimanawa Range">
<text>The Kaimanawa Range, officially called the Kaimanawa Mountains since 16 July 2020, is a range of mountains in the central North Island of New Zealand. They extend for 50 kilometres in a northeast–southwest direction through largely uninhabited country to the south of Lake Taupō, east of the &quot;Desert Road&quot;. Their slopes form part of the North Island Volcanic Plateau.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;breath for food&quot; for &quot;Kaimanawa&quot;.

The lands around the mountains are scrubby. To the west, where the Rangipo Desert is located, the soils are poor quality. To the east, the soils are more fertile, but the land is very rough. A population of feral horses, the Kaimanawa horses, roam free on the ranges.

Unlike the majority of mountain ranges in New Zealand, the Kaimanawa Range is divided into private land. Considerable areas of the Rangipo Desert are used by the New Zealand Army for training.

==Demographics==
Kaimanawa covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The very low population figure and rounding of numbers results in some odd figures in the census results.
Kaimanawa had a population of 180 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 174 people (2900.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 123 people (215.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 0 households, comprising 177 males and 0 females. The median age was 47.3 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 0 people (0.0%) aged under 15 years, 27 (15.0%) aged 15 to 29, 126 (70.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 30 (16.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 60.0% European/Pākehā, 48.3% Māori, 5.0% Pacific peoples, 1.7% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 8.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 45.0% had no religion, 31.7% were Christian, 8.3% had Māori religious beliefs and 5.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 9 (5.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 51 (28.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $1,100, compared with $31,800 nationally. 3 people (1.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 42 (23.3%) people were employed full-time, 36 (20.0%) were part-time, and 9 (5.0%) were unemployed.

== Kaimanawa Wall ==

The Kaimanawa Wall is a geological feature in the Kaimanawa State Forest. The Tuwharetoa &quot;tangata whenua&quot; claim an “oral tradition” of the place as a &quot;kōhatu&quot; (rock). A popular theory is that the wall is a pre-Māori civilization artifact.

The wall formation was inspected by an archaeologist and a geologist; neither saw evidence of a human origin. In a preliminary investigation, archaeologist Neville Ritchie of the New Zealand Department of Conservation observed &quot;matching micro-irregularities along the joints.&quot; This indicated that the blocks in the wall were too perfectly matched. He also observed the joints were neither straight nor truly horizontal nor perpendicular, indicating the joint alignments were too poorly constructed. Ritchie concluded the blocks are a natural formation based on the presence of matching micro-irregularities in blocks and imperfect joint alignment.

Peter Wood, a geologist of the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences at Wairakei, inspected the blocks for an afternoon and concluded they are natural fractures in &quot;jointed Rangitaiki ignimbrite, a 330,000 year old volcanic rock that is common in the Taupō Volcanic Zone.&quot; Both vertical and horizontal joints are common. Fractures in the Rangitaiki ignimbrite formed when it cooled and contracted after flowing into place during an eruption.

<text>Alan Edgar Stratford Johnson (22 September 1925 – 29 January 2002), known as Stratford Johns, was a British stage, film and television actor who is best remembered for playing the role as senior CID officer Charlie Barlow, a character he originated in the early years of the long-running BBC police series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, and then continued to play in several spin-off series in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
Johns was born and grew up in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. After serving as a deckhand in the South African navy during World War II, he worked for a time in accountancy, but soon became involved in amateur theatre.

==Career==
In 1948, Johns bought a one-way ticket to Britain and learned his craft working in repertory theatre at Southend-on-Sea for almost five years. He began to appear in British films from the mid-1950s, including a bit part in the classic Ealing comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). He ran a small hotel in London during the 1950s, and was a member of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre during the Angry Young Men period when new playwrights, including John Osborne, introduced new themes to British theatre. His most famous character, Barlow, was noted for his hard edges, owing much to the changes in characterisation pioneered at the Royal Court.

In 1961 he appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; Season One episode &quot;The Frighteners&quot; in the role of Sir Thomas Weller.

In 1962 he won the part of Barlow in &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and soon became one of the most familiar and popular faces on British television. During the long run (1962–1965) of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, he transferred his character to the spin-off series, &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; (1966–1969), and later &quot;Softly, Softly: Task Force&quot; (1969–1972). He also played the voice of the mysterious &quot;Guvnor&quot; in &quot;The Great St Trinian&#x27;s Train Robbery&quot; (1966).

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in October 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at BBC Television Centre.

In the 1970s he starred in a third spin-off series, &quot;Barlow at Large&quot; (1971, 1973), which saw the character transferred to British Intelligence: it was later retitled simply &quot;Barlow&quot; (1974–1975). Although the Barlow character remained popular (and appeared in another spin-off, in which he investigated the &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; murders), ratings for these solo spin-offs declined, and the final series ended in 1975. Barlow was seen once more in 1976, in the series &quot;Second Verdict&quot;.

Johns appeared as President of the Council Bradshaw in the 1970 award-winning film &quot;Cromwell&quot; with Richard Harris in the role of Cromwell and Sir Alec Guinness as King Charles I.

In 1973 Johns was named BBC TV Personality of the Year by the Variety Club of Great Britain. He portrayed the apartheid-supporting Namib mine superintendent Mr. Zimmerman in two episodes of the 1985 mini-series &quot;Master of the Game&quot;.

Johns later appeared in the Ken Russell films &quot;Salome&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; and &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; (both 1988), followed by the mid-1980s Channel 4 series &quot;Brond&quot;, in which he played the title character.

His many stage credits include Daddy Warbucks in the original West End run of &quot;Annie&quot; – he can be heard on the original London cast album – and the Ghost of Christmas Present in the original Birmingham cast of the stage adaptation of the film musical &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970), on the recording of which he can also be heard. His guest appearances on TV include &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Department S&quot;, &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot; (1982) and the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Games&quot;. He had a prominent role as Calpurnius Piso in the BBC&#x27;s acclaimed adaptation of Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976); he played Magwitch in the BBC&#x27;s 1981 adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, and the jailer in &quot;The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs&quot;. Johns appeared in the 1984 pop video for &quot;Young at Heart&quot; recorded by The Bluebells. With him were veteran Scottish actress Molly Weir and Scots singer/actress Clare Grogan. In 1993, Johns appeared in the BBC period drama &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot; alongside a young Ewan McGregor and Rachel Weisz.

Johns played the role of Cyril Isaiah Greengrass, the conniving brother of Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in the nostalgic Yorkshire Television series, &quot;Heartbeat.&quot;

He was also the author of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Gumphlumph&quot;; in the mid-1960s, at the height of his fame as Barlow, he read it on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Jackanory&quot;. &quot;Gumphlumph&quot; would be revived, again with Johns narrating, for the TV-am children&#x27;s programme &quot;Rub-a-Dub-Tub&quot; in the 1980s.

==Personal life==
He married Nanette Ryder in 1955; they had four children. He ran the small hotel in St Martins Lane called the St Martins Hotel; it was managed by Elizabeth Kissick-Jones, formerly Hartnell, who was the aunt of his wife Nanette. The hotel was very popular with actors and he ran it until 1976.

After several years of poor health, Johns died from heart disease in 2002, aged 76.

<text>The USRA standard locomotives and railroad cars were designed by the United States Railroad Administration, the nationalized rail system of the United States during World War I. 1,870 steam locomotives and over 100,000 railroad cars were built to these designs during the USRA&#x27;s tenure. The locomotive designs in particular were the nearest the American railroads and locomotive builders ever got to standard locomotive types, and after the USRA was dissolved in 1920 many of the designs were duplicated in number, 3,251 copies being constructed overall. The last steam locomotive built for a Class I railroad in the United States, an 0-8-0 built by the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1953, was a USRA design. A total of 97 railroads used USRA or USRA-derived locomotives.

==Steam locomotive types==
The USRA developed designs for 0-6-0 and 0-8-0 switcher locomotives, 2-6-6-2 and 2-8-8-2 Mallet locomotives, and both light and heavy versions of the 2-8-2, 2-10-2, 4-6-2, and 4-8-2 types. The light versions were designed with an axle load of 54,000 lb (24,500 kg) permitting usage on the vast majority of railroads, while the heavy versions were designed to a maximum axle load of 60,000 lb (27,200 kg) for lines with more heavily constructed track.

The U.S.R.A. also distributed 2-10-0 Decapods of Russian design to railroads under its control.

===USRA 0-6-0===
255 of the USRA 0-6-0 design were built, as well as many copies.

===USRA 0-8-0===
175 of the USRA 0-8-0 design were built, and it was copied extensively thereafter.

===USRA Light 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot;===
614 of the USRA Light Mikado type were constructed, making it the most populous USRA type.

===USRA Heavy 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot;===
233 of the USRA Heavy Mikados were built.

===USRA Light 2-10-2 &quot;Santa Fe&quot;===
94 USRA Light Santa Fe locomotives were constructed.

===USRA Heavy 2-10-2 &quot;Santa Fe&quot;===
175 USRA Heavy Santa Fe locomotives were built.

===USRA Light 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot;===
106 USRA Light Pacifics were constructed.

===USRA Heavy 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot;===
20 USRA Heavy Pacifics were built.

===USRA Light 4-8-2 &quot;Mountain&quot;===
47 of the USRA Light Mountain type were built.

===USRA Heavy 4-8-2 &quot;Mountain&quot;===
15 USRA Heavy Mountains were constructed.

===2-6-6-2===
30 of the USRA 2-6-6-2 type were built.

===2-8-8-2===
106 of the USRA 2-8-8-2 locomotives were constructed. The Norfolk and Western Railway, in particular, continued building this type after the USRA period, developing and modernising it over time, as its Class Y. A N&amp;W Y6B was the last conventional freight-hauling steam locomotive built in the United States.

==Freight cars==
As part of the USRA, two common boxcar designs were developed: a single sheathed car and a double sheathed car. When the USRA boxcars were being designed there wasn&#x27;t an industry consensus on which was better, so both were built. Freight car design was still in flux in the early part of the 20th century. As John White points out in &quot;The American Freight Car&quot;, most cars were really composites, not completely wood or steel, and even after steel cars had become the norm, wood had its uses and advantages. Still, steel underframes had come to replace wood underframes, but as metallurgy improved, there were new designs developed that took advantage of the improved technology. USRA double sheathed boxcars had a fishbelly underframe while the USRA single sheathed cars did not. 
In general, double sheathed boxcars are like girder bridges, so all the support needs to come from the frame. Those cars need a stronger frame, hence the fishbelly underframe. Single sheathed cars are like truss bridges, with the metal side bracing acting as the main structural support for the &quot;bridge.&quot; While some engineers did not trust the steel bracing to support a single sheathed car and ordered fishbelly frames for strength, others valued the savings in weight and ordered cars with simpler frames like the USRA SS design.
