<text>.ph is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Philippines.

The official domain registry of the .ph domain is dotPH Domains Inc. dotPH holds and maintains the database of PH domain names, specifically .ph, .com.ph, .net.ph, and .org.ph. Its domain name registrars are not only individuals, businesses, and organizations in the Philippines, but also those in other parts of the world.

The PH domain is currently administered by José Emmanuel &quot;Joel&quot; Disini, who is also dotPH&#x27;s current CEO. Disini has been the domain administrator since Jon Postel assigned him the domain in 1990. The domain is sponsored by the PH Domain Foundation, a social outreach arm of dotPH which was also founded by Disini together with a group of IT professionals in August 1999.

In 1994, the administration of the .gov.ph domain was sub-delegated to the Government of the Philippines. In like manner, .edu.ph was sub-delegated to the Philippine Network Foundation, Inc. (PHNET).

Aside from being the registry, dotPH sells domains and web-related services such as web hosting, co-location, private registration and e-mail forwarding. dotPH also offers a free referral service which connects Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises with a network of over 300 accredited professional Filipino web designers. It formerly offered a free blogging service through .i.ph domains.

==History==
===Birth of the .ph registry===
In 1989, Joel Disini founded the Email Company (EMC), one of the earliest Internet service providers in the Philippines. At that time most networks (including EMC) were connected to the Internet via UUCP. Disini&#x27;s network had a UUCP connection to UUNET. This network connection, along with Disini&#x27;s credentials as a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering graduate of Caltech and five-year experience in Macintosh Networking &amp; Communications software development in Cupertino, California, became Jon Postel&#x27;s basis for delegating the .ph domain to him. The .ph country code top-level domain was officially delegated on September 14, 1990. Since then, .ph domains have been commercially available to the public.

In 1994, the PHNET wide-area network, a project funded by DOST, completed its development and was able to connect the Philippines to the rest of the world by establishing TCP/IP connections to the U.S. using 64 kbit/s international leased lines.

At this point, the PHNET Foundation wanted to take over the administration of the .ph domain registry. Protracted negotiations took place, and eventually the responsibility of administrating the .edu.ph and .gov.ph domains were transferred to the PHNET Foundation and the Department of Science and Technology, respectively.

At that time domain fees ranged from Php 450 to Php 1,350. Domains registered during this period had no expiration and therefore had no renewal rates, thus the label lifetime domains. However, a fee was charged for modifications to these domains. Lifetime domains were non-transferable, and were only valid for the lifetime of the original Registrant.

===PH Domain Foundation and dotPH===
In August 1999 Disini and the technical people at EMC formed the PH Domain Foundation. It sought to promote the Internet and free unlimited email services in rural areas. It also took charge of the domain selling business and the management of the .ph domain registry.

On October 1, 1999, the PH Domain Foundation launched a fully automated online system for domain registration. It also launched a flat .ph domain space, enabling people to register domains like &quot;codice_1&quot;. Lifetime domain registration was halted, and all domains registered after October 1 subsequently carried expiration dates. These domain owners had to pay a fee to renew their domains.

At around this period, the &quot;for-profit&quot; business and technical side of the PH Domain Foundation became identified as dotPH. Activities related to domains and the business were now attributed to dotPH, such as the resolution on the dispute between Yahoo! Philippines and another Philippine company, the launching of the automated online registration system, and even the administration of the .ph domain registry itself. To this day, dotPH is the official domain registry of the Philippines.

==Other developments==

In 2000, dotPH developed a system called the Shared Registry System (SRS) which enabled domain name registrars and ISP&#x27;s to manage domains and accept registrations on their own website by connecting to the dotPH registry backend. This is done by downloading and installing on their server a module that does the actual communication with the registry backend using an XML-based protocol.

dotPH also became one of the first Philippine websites to accept online credit card payments.

Through the years, dotPH has expanded its offerings to more than just domain names. Becoming a Google Cloud Partner in 2016 allowed dotPH to offer cloud and collaboration solutions in addition to services such as web hosting, SSL certificates and website builders.

dotPH currently uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), the most widely used protocol for communicating between Domain Registries and Registrars, to process domain registrations and renewals.

<text>Neoclassical finance is an approach within finance, developing since the mid-1960s, which holds that markets are efficient, and that prices will thus tend to equilibrium and be &quot;rational&quot;;
and asset pricing models must then reflect these.
It may be contrasted with, for example, behavioral finance which is based on differing, less idealized, assumptions regarding markets and investors.
It built on earlier developments such as the Austrian School of economics, and cross-fertilized with atomic physics (see state price) and other heavily quantitative disciplines.

<doc id="1237993" wikidata="Q16248811" url="?curid=1237993" title="Whitchurch Lock">
<text>Whitchurch Lock is a lock and weir on the River Thames in England. It is a pound lock, built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1787. It is on an island near the Oxfordshire village of Whitchurch-on-Thames and is accessible only by boat.

The weir crosses the river to the Berkshire village of Pangbourne.

==History==
There was a flash lock recorded at Whitchurch in the 16th century. The sketch map shows the main dam, which was solid and rose to a height above normal high water level. Near the southern bank, there was a sluice (marked &quot;E&quot; on the sketch), which was wide, and was fitted with flood gates and overfall boards, to accommodate a drop of in the river level. The flash lock was in the centre, with a winch on the north bank to haul the barges through against the current. It was wide, which was the standard size for all flash locks below Abingdon. Near to the island was a &quot;tumbling bay&quot;, an overfall weir with its crest just below normal low water level. It was about wide and is marked &quot;H&quot; on the sketch. In common with most of the weirs on the Thames, the width of the tumbling bay was gradually increased, until it formed most of the weir, apart from the sluice.

The pound lock, built of oak, was installed at the island in the summer of 1787. Two alternative sites were originally considered. One would have expanded the mill stream on the Whitchurch side, and another would have involved a cut across land occupied by the Swan public house at Pangbourne. A lock house was built on the island in the 1830s. In the later 19th century local people used to cross over the weir to avoid paying tolls on the bridge. The lock was rebuilt in 1876 and access across the weir was closed. The right of way from Whitchurch to the lock was closed in 1888.

==Access to the lock==
Whitchurch Lock is the only lock on the River Thames which has no public access other than by boat.

==Reach above the lock==


The reach passes along the Chiltern Hills, culminating in Goring Gap. Halfway along the reach is the Gatehampton Railway Bridge.

The hills on the Oxfordshire side are populated by houses at Whitchurch and are then covered by the Hartslock beech woods. This name derives from a lock among the islands below the hills. This had become disused by the time the pound locks were built, but the obstructions remaining from it were not removed until 1910. The river turns west away from the hills leaving flat meadows up to Goring.

On the Berkshire side the river passes the river side at Pangbourne where there are seven distinctive Edwardian-style houses overlooking the river. These were built by D. H. Evans the shop owner and were nicknamed the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; as it was alleged that he kept a mistress in each of them. Beyond this point is Beale Park and set back from the river is Basildon Park. The river turns north again at the Goring Gap where the hills on the Streatley side overshadow the river. Just before the Goring Lock is Goring and Streatley Bridge.

Pangbourne College is based on this stretch of the river and the Pangbourne Junior Sculls take place on the reach in November.

The Thames Path, having crossed Whitchurch Bridge, continues away from the river through the streets of Whitchurch and then through the woods. This is a section with steep inclines and long flights of steps. Once back to the river side at Hartslock, it continues on the Oxfordshire bank to Goring.

<doc id="1237996" wikidata="Q319553" url="?curid=1237996" title="Nicky Hayden">
<text>Nicholas Patrick Hayden (July 30, 1981 May 22, 2017), nicknamed &quot;The Kentucky Kid&quot;, was an American professional motorcycle racer who won the MotoGP World Championship in 2006. Hayden began racing motorcycles at a young age. He began his road racing career in the CMRA before progressing to the AMA Supersport Championship and then to the AMA Superbike Championship. He won the AMA title in 2002 and was approached by the Repsol Honda team to race for them in MotoGP in 2003.

Hayden largely had mixed results in his first 2 seasons at Repsol Honda only getting 4 podiums. He then rallied in the 2005 season by scoring his first Grand Prix win at Laguna Seca, and finishing third in the standings at the end of the season. The next year, 2006, would be Hayden&#x27;s best in motorcycle racing as he won the 2006 MotoGP world title, breaking Valentino Rossi&#x27;s five-year consecutive streak. He remained with Honda for two more seasons without a win, before moving to Ducati for 2009. Hayden had five largely unsuccessful seasons at Ducati, with his highest championship position being a seventh place in 2010. He subsequently moved to the Honda Aspar team in 2014 where he raced for two seasons.

Hayden moved to the Superbike World Championship with the Ten Kate Racing Honda team in 2016. He finished fifth in his first season in the Superbike World Championship with the highlight of his season being a win in Malaysia. For 2017 Hayden continued with the Red Bull Honda team (formerly Ten Kate Racing team).

On May 17, 2017, Hayden was hit by a driver while riding his bicycle in Italy. He suffered a traumatic brain injury and died five days later in a local hospital. Hayden was posthumously inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Career==

===Early career===
Hayden was born in Owensboro, Kentucky. He started road racing with the CMRA, often against racers many times older. Hayden would often start races from the back of the grid because a family or crew member would have to hold his bike upright as his feet would not yet touch the ground. Later, at age 17, he was racing factory Honda RC45 superbikes while still in high school.

In 1999, he won the AMA Supersport championship on board a privateer Honda. In 2001, his first full season as an AMA superbike racer, he came within 40 points of winning the championship, finishing behind only champion Mat Mladin and runner-up Eric Bostrom. In the 2002 season, he won the Daytona 200 on a Honda Superbike en route to becoming the youngest ever AMA Superbike Champion, defeating reigning triple champion Mat Mladin, among others. He also entered the World Superbike round at Laguna Seca, making a solid fourth in the first race before colliding with Noriyuki Haga in the second which ended in a 13th-place finish.

Hayden was one of a long line of American road racers to come from the American dirt-track scene. In 1999, Hayden won his first Grand National Championship race (Hagerstown Half Mile) and took Rookie of the Year honors. He was also declared the AMA&#x27;s athlete of the Year. In 2000, Hayden won the Springfield Short Track. In 2002, despite racing in just a handful of dirt-track events, Hayden won four races: Springfield Short Track (twice), Springfield TT, and Peoria TT. At the Springfield TT race, the three Hayden brothers took the first three places (Nicky first, Tommy second, and Roger Lee third).

The win at the 2002 Peoria TT came after beating 13-time Peoria winner, Chris Carr, despite starting from the penalty line. Hayden only lacked a win at a mile track to join Dick Mann, Kenny Roberts, Bubba Shobert, and Doug Chandler in the prestigious &quot;Grand Slam Club.&quot;

===MotoGP World Championship===
====Honda (2003–2008)====

=====2003=====

Immediately after winning his AMA Superbike championship, Hayden was tapped to join not only Honda&#x27;s MotoGP racing efforts, but what was arguably the premier team in MotoGP racing: The Factory Repsol Honda team.

In his rookie year of MotoGP, Hayden would be overshadowed by his teammate Valentino Rossi, who was the defending series champion of the year, but would still score consistent points. At the opening round in Japan, Hayden finished seventh while Rossi won the race. But the race was marred by the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato who crashed at the 130R and hit the barrier at high speed in the ensuing Casio Triangle. At the next race in South Africa, Hayden would once more finish in seventh position while his teammate scored second place.

Hayden&#x27;s only retirement of the season came in Spain. He would score two 12th places at the next rounds in France and Italy and would finish ninth in Catalunya. Further points would arrive at the Dutch round with an 11th place, the British round with an eighth place, the German round with a then career-best fifth place, nearly losing out on fourth after a battle with Loris Capirossi, the Czech round with a fifth place, the Portuguese round with a ninth place and the Rio de Janeiro round with another fifth position.

At the Pacific GP, Hayden would score his first ever podium in the motoGP class after an overtaking manoeuvre from Makoto Tamada on the last lap, which pushed Sete Gibernau into the gravel, was deemed to be against the rules by Race Direction and disqualified Tamada from the race, gifting third place to Hayden. Hayden finished fourth in Malaysia, before scoring his second third place podium at the penultimate round in Australia. During the race, Hayden had made his way up to third but ran slightly wide at the Honda curve, dropping him behind Marco Melandri, Tohru Ukawa, Sete Gibernau and Carlos Checa. He fought his way back and finished +0.031 seconds ahead of Gibernau. Hayden also battled with teammate Rossi on the opening laps for fifth, passing and re-passing each other on multiple occasions. At the Valencian Community race, Hayden would finish just outside the points in 16th place.

Hayden finished fifth in his first year in the championship with 130 points, 227 points behind the champion and teammate Valentino Rossi, an achievement that won him the Rookie-of-the-Year award.

=====2004=====

After his decent rookie year in the top class, many expected him to do even better and some even speculated about a title fight with his new teammate Alex Barros or Valentino Rossi.

At the season opener in South Africa, Hayden started off well by scoring fifth, a result he would equal at the next round in Spain. In France however, he finished 11th before retiring at the first part of the rain-affected race in Italy. Hayden had qualified second on Saturday, 0.369 behind polesitter Sete Gibernau and 0.373 seconds quicker than third position Valentino Rossi to secure his second ever front row start on the grid. Hayden would retire once more in Catalunya, this time due to mechanical problems to his Factory Honda bike. At the Dutch round, Hayden would once more finish in fifth place.

At the seventh round of the season—the Rio de Janeiro GP—Hayden would score his first podium of the season in the form of a third place. At the start, both Max Biaggi and Hayden put pressure on Kenny Roberts Jr. who started from pole before passing him. At the halfway point, Hayden was in second place before being overtaken by the Honda Pons of Makoto Tamada and was relegated to third, a place he would maintain until the finish line. At the next race in Germany, Hayden would finish third once more, behind his teammate Barros and race winner Biaggi. On Saturday, Hayden qualified ninth, but managed to charge up the field and close in on Biaggi and Rossi halfway into the race, along with Barros. He would overtake Hayden for third place before he also passed Rossi for second. With six laps to go, Hayden overtook Rossi for the final podium position and would hold on to cross the line 0.207 seconds ahead of &quot;The Doctor&quot;.

After his consistent podium finishes in the last two Grand Prix, Hayden would finish off the podium once more in fourth at the British GP. At the Czech Republic, Hayden would retire for the third time this season. On Saturday, he had qualified on the third row in seventh place, but showed some serious pace during the pre-race warm-up session by finishing first. When the lights went out, Hayden initially started off well—he moved up the field to battle with a three-man group consisting of Rossi, Biaggi and Barros, who tried to reduce the gap to race leader Gibernau. After Barros fell and retired, Hayden moved up to fourth, but with five laps to go, Hayden lost the front wheel on turn-in and bounced into the gravel, retiring from the race in the process.

Hayden would break his right collarbone when he rode a CRF450 Honda dirt bike in Italy, causing him to miss the next race in Portugal. He would return the next round in Japan but would retire from the race after he was involved in a six-bike crash on the opening lap, marking his fourth retirement of the season.

At the next three rounds in Qatar, Malaysia and Australia, Hayden would finish fifth, fourth and sixth, respectively, before retiring for the fifth and final time of the year at the last round at the Valencian Community. Hayden battled with Rossi and Biaggi during the race until his bike got sideways under braking into turn one, forcing him to ride wide (after narrowly avoiding hitting the back of Biaggi&#x27;s machine)—handing Troy Bayliss third and Tamada fourth in the process. One lap later, he lost the front of his RCV heading onto the back straight and span out into retirement, much to the dismay of the watching Michael Jordan.

Hayden finished eighth in the championship with 117 points, 187 points behind the champion Valentino Rossi. He scored two podiums and retired five times—the most times he retired in one season in his career.

=====2005=====
After a relatively poor season in 2004, many people critiqued his performances and stated that he should be kicked out of the Factory Honda team. However, things would improve for him in 2005.

At the first round of the season in Spain, Hayden retired for the first time this season. Hayden was in a strong position to finish third—overtaking Valentino Rossi&#x27;s Yamaha in the early part of the race before being demoted to third by the same Rossi—maintaining a two-second gap to fourth place Marco Melandri. With eight laps to go and 1.5 seconds behind the front runners Sete Gibernau and Rossi, Hayden lost the front of his factory RCV as he tipped in to final corner, sending him into the gravel trap and retirement. In contrast, Hayden scored consistent points in the next six races—the Portuguese, Chinese, French, Italian and Catalan and Dutch rounds—finishing seventh, ninth, sixth twice, fifth and fourth, respectively.

His breakthrough came at the United States GP, held at the Laguna Seca Raceway. The Californian venue had not been on the calendar since 1994, meaning that only a handful of riders had experience with this track. Australian Troy Bayliss and American Colin Edwards knew this track well from their Superbike days, as well as Hayden, who won an AMA race at the circuit in 2000 and taken fourth in a World Superbike wildcard outing in 2002. Rossi on the other hand, had never raced here, giving these riders an advantage. On Saturday, Hayden took his first ever pole position in the MotoGP class, beating former teammate Rossi by 0.354 seconds. On race day, Bayliss would be battling him for the first spot when the lights went out, but held on and built a gap of a second by the end of the opening lap. Rossi passed Bayliss for second place but 2.6 seconds separating Hayden and Rossi by lap 10. On lap 16, Edwards overtook Rossi for second place and cut the lead gap to 1.8 seconds three laps later. Hayden responded by upping his pace and crossed the line 1.941 seconds clear of second-place Colin Edwards and 2.312 seconds clear of third place Valentino Rossi. This was the first personal victory for the &quot;Kentucky Kid&quot; and the first win for the Factory Honda team since Rossi&#x27;s last win at the 2003 Valencian Community round.

After a great result at his home grand prix in the US, Hayden recorded his second DNF of the season in Great Britain. On lap two, Hayden high-sided his bike at the final turn while being in seventh place. At round 10 in Germany, Hayden scored his second pole position of the season, as well as overall, beating Sete Gibernau by 0.101 seconds on his 24th birthday. When the lights went out, Hayden converted his pole into a lead at the first turn, followed by Rossi, Barros and Gibernau. The race was stopped on lap six after a highside of John Hopskin&#x27;s Suzuki caused him to lay on the track injured. After the race was restarted with the results from lap five taken, Hayden would once more start in first position, followed by Rossi and Barros. At the restart, Hayden once more kept the position, with Rossi, Gibernau, Barros and now Max Biaggi following him. On lap two, Rossi took the lead from Hayden before he was relegated to third by Gibernau, overtaking him at the end of the same lap. Gibernau ran wide on the last lap, but Hayden failed to capitalise on this mistake, crossing the line 0.885 seconds behind race winner Rossi to pick up his second podium place of the season.

In the next three races, Hayden would finish off the podium. At the Czech, Japanese and Malaysian rounds, Hayden finished fifth, seventh and fourth—picking up the fastest lap at the Sepang circuit.

Hayden finished the season on the podium in the next four consecutive races. In Qatar, Hayden would score another third place podium position. In Australia, Hayden went on to score his third pole of the season on Saturday and set a new record on the Phillip Island circuit with a time of 1:29.337, 0.731 seconds faster than Rossi&#x27;s previous record on the venue. The next day, Hayden converted his pole into a turn-one lead when the red lights went out. On lap three, Rossi overtook Hayden going into turn one before then being passed by Marco Melandri. Hayden fought back, passing Melandri again on the runup to Lukey Heights and closing the gap to Rossi and battling hard with him from laps eight to 17. On lap 17, Hayden would retake the lead from Rossi, but he had slowed down the pace enough for the trio of Melandri, Gibernau and Checa to catch the two at the top. On lap 19, Rossi overtook Hayden before Melandri did the same by taking the position under braking at the Honda hairpin. The pair would swap positions multiple times before Hayden finally found a firm advantage over Melandri, but the combined effect of the squabble and Rossi&#x27;s victory charge up front, meant that Hayden was now one second behind Rossi with five laps to go. Hayden did everything to close the gap, but Rossi managed to win the race with a 1.007 second lead over him. At the new Turkish GP, Hayden took another third place and at the Valencian Community round, he would narrowly lose out on the race win by 0.097 seconds to race winner Marco Melandri, battling hard on the last lap.

Hayden finished third in the championship with 206 points, 161 points behind the champion Valentino Rossi and 14 points behind runner-up Marco Melandri. He scored six podiums—one of which was a win.

=====2006=====

After silencing his critics in 2005 by winning his home race and scoring a multitude of podiums, 2006 would be an even better year for the &quot;Kentucky Kid&quot;.

At the opening round in Spain, Hayden finished third, holding off Toni Elías by less than 0.1 seconds while title defender Valentino Rossi finished 14th after he was crashed out by the same Elías. At the second race in Qatar, Hayden finished in second place with Rossi winning the race. Hayden was running a strong race, even passing Rossi for the lead on lap 19, but ultimately lost out to him on the last lap and crossed the line 0.900 seconds behind Rossi. In Turkey, Hayden would finish third once more after his Factory Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa crashed out of contention at the final stages of the race. This allowed Hayden to take the championship lead from Capirossi by just one point. At the Chinese round, Hayden would record his fourth consecutive podium by finishing second behind his rookie teammate Pedrosa, who won the race. Hayden started fifth but dropped to seventh on the opening lap before moving up the field and finding himself second, behind Pedrosa. In the last 10 laps, Hayden closed the gap to Pedrosa to just 0.6 seconds with four laps to go, but he responded by upping his pace, setting a fastest lap and increasing the gap to win his first ever race with a margin of 1.505 seconds over Hayden.

At the French GP, Hayden finished off the podium for the first time this season by finishing fifth, but would still leave Le Mans with a 43-point advantage over Rossi in the championship because he finished even lower in eighth. His closest contenders at that time were Marco Melandri and Loris Capirossi, who were both three points behind at that point. After France, Hayden bounced back by finishing third in Italy, battling throughout the race and almost taking second from Capirossi (which also caused Capirossi to take the lead in the championship), second in Catalunya (while both Capirossi and Melandri missed the race), scoring the fastest lap, and scoring his first victory of the season at the Dutch round. Hayden started from fifth on the grid but overtook Marco Melandri, Shinya Nakano and pole-sitter John Hopkins to move up to second and chase down Colin Edwards, who had been leading the race for much of the race. On the penultimate lap, Hayden overtook him under braking for the back chicane. Edwards tried to keep his Factory Yamaha alongside him but was forced to lift and go down an escape road—rejoining just over a second from the Factory Honda rider. That mistake looked likely to settle the race, but Edwards pushed hard and passed Hayden again with just half a lap to go. Both were riding on the limit, but Edwards got a better drive heading into the fast kinks that precede the final chicane and retook the lead with just a few corners to go. Edwards then ran his M1 wide through the fast left hander, giving him a defensive inside line for the final chicane. Hayden lunged his machine and both went through the corner side-by-side, but Hayden couldn&#x27;t make the corner (possibly after selecting neutral) and ran wide across the gravel. This would have given the victory to Edwards, but he also ran wide onto a slick patch of synthetic grass and was thrown off his bike, allowing Hayden to win the race. This win gave Hayden a full set of 25 points and with Rossi finishing in eighth place, he increased his gap over him by 46 points in the championship.

Hayden would once more finish off the podium in seventh place in Great Britain with Rossi picking up second place, but Hayden would respond in Germany by finishing third behind Marco Melandri and Rossi whom he battled with all throughout the race, finishing 0.266 behind eventual race winner Rossi, and by winning his home race at the United States round in Laguna Seca for the second consecutive year in a row. Hayden started sixth on the grid, but gained three places at turn one and was chasing down Kenny Roberts Jr. and pole-sitter Chris Vermeulen. Hayden overtook Kenny Roberts Jr. on lap nine, but by that time Vermeulen had built up a two-second gap. However, Hayden cut the gap to Vermeulen down as Vermeulen&#x27;s Bridgestone tires started to suffer in the warm conditions and—as the halfway stage arrived—was within striking distance. Vermeulen ran slightly wide on the next lap, reluctantly conceding the win to Hayden. After taking over first place from Vermeulen, he built up a two-second gap and crossed the line first, 3.186 seconds ahead of Hayden&#x27;s teammate Dani Pedrosa. Rossi retired from the race due to mechanical problems, increasing Hayden&#x27;s championship lead over now second-place Pedrosa by 34 points and Rossi by 51 points, who now stood fourth in the championship.

Hayden finished ninth at the Czech Republic, fourth at the Malaysian, fifth at the Australian, despite scoring his first and only pole position of the season here, and finishing fifth once more in Japan. With Rossi scoring consistent podiums—including one win at Sepang—he managed to move up to second in the championship once more and cut the points deficit from 51 at Laguna Seca to 12 in Motegi.

At the penultimate round in Portugal, Rossi took pole position on Saturday with Hayden starting in third position. On race day, Hayden was taken out by his teammate Dani Pedrosa on the fifth lap after Pedrosa tried to overtake him but failed, lost the front and hit Hayden, causing both riders to retire. This first and only retirement of the year would hand Rossi the championship by eight points going into the last round of the season. However, because Rossi finished second—just 0.002 behind race winner Toni Elías—he took away five points from Rossi, which would play a crucial role at the last race in Valencia. After the race, Hayden said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t expect Dani to pull over and let me by, but I definitely didn&#x27;t expect him to do that.&quot;

Being relegated to second in the championship standings, Hayden knew it would be tough to win at the Valencian Community round. Rossi needed to finish in second place or higher to win the title. He took his second consecutive pole position on Saturday with Hayden starting on the second row in fifth place. On race day however, Rossi got a poor start, dropping him back in seventh place on the opening lap. Hayden meanwhile moved up from sixth to second on lap three of 30. He then tried to go after race leader and wildcard rider Troy Bayliss, who replaced the injured Sete Gibernau. On lap five however, Rossi made a crucial mistake when he lost the front wheel of his M1 and slid out of contention. He managed to get going again, but it would be to no avail: Rossi finished 13th while Hayden crossed the line in third place behind the Ducatis of Bayliss and Capirossi, collecting 247 points to Hayden&#x27;s 252 and in turn, Nicky Hayden won the 2006 title by five points.

=====2007=====
On September 22, 2006, Hayden signed a two-year agreement that allowed for him to race for and develop with the factory Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) team for the 2007 and 2008 MotoGP seasons. He utilized the 800cc Honda RC212V, and as title holders, his MotoGP racing number changed from 69 to 1 for the 2007 season.

The 2007 season started badly for Hayden, struggling with the performance of the new bike. In Qatar he finished seventh while his teammate Dani Pedrosa finished on the podium, behind Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner, who won for his debut race for Ducati. At the next two races in Spain and Turkey, Hayden finished in seventh place twice before finishing 12th in China.

At the French round, Hayden recorded his first retirement of the season. While running fourth in the race, he suffered a heavy fall with just four laps to go. Chris Vermeulen on the Suzuki won the rain-affected race. At the Italian and Catalan rounds, Hayden finished 10th and 11th before finishing outside of the points in 17th in Great Britain after crashing out of sixth place early on.

Things would get better at the Dutch round. On Thursday, he had a good pace on both free practice sessions, finishing third in both sessions. At the third free practice session on Saturday, he finished third once more. However, a wet qualifying meant that Hayden lost a lot of the momentum he had in the dry and qualified in 13th place. During warm-up on Sunday, the track was dry and Hayden finished the session first, ahead of the Suzuki of John Hopkins and the Yamaha of Valentino Rossi. When the race started, Hayden moved from 13th to sixth going into the first corner, and moved up to finish in third: his first podium of the season and his highest position since the start of the season. His good form continued at the next race in Germany. Starting just 14th on the grid after another poor qualifying performance, the Michelin-shod Honda of Hayden, as well as the Yamaha of Colin Edwards fared much better on the Sachsenring track compared to the Bridgestone-shod Ducati of Casey Stoner, whom they would overtake in the closing stages of the race. Hayden finished third, making this his second consecutive podium of the year.

After winning his home grand prix for two consecutive years, Hayden would retire for the second time at the United States round. After qualifying fourth on Saturday, he ran wide when he ran wide alongside John Hopkins at turn two and then made contact with Hopkins&#x27; Suzuki as both attempted to get back on line. Hayden would rejoin in 16th position, his Honda damaged, fighting with wildcards Chaz Davies and Miguel Duhamel. On lap eight, he was lapping around three seconds slower than the rest of the field and ahead of only Hopkins on the timing screens, prompting him to retire eventually. Before the race, an authorized biography on Hayden and his brothers--&quot;The Haydens: Nicky, Tommy, &amp; Roger, from OWB to MotoGP&quot;—timed to coincide with his return to the US Grand Prix.
He bounced back at the next race in the Czech Republic, scoring another third place podium. On Saturday, Hayden qualified 0.280 seconds behind Casey Stoner in second place, but slipped to fourth after a poor getaway at the line. He would eventually pass his teammate Pedrosa to hold on to third place on lap two, a position he held for the rest of the race.

At the new race in San Marino, Hayden finished 13th after a poor start and a crash—involving Randy de Puniet and Pedrosa—forced him into the gravel. At the Portuguese round, Hayden scored his first and only pole position of the season on Saturday, outqualifying Casey Stoner by just 0.040 seconds. However, he would struggle on race day, managing to finish just off the podium in fourth after moving up the order after an early race slump. In Japan, Hayden finished in ninth place.

In Australia, Hayden retired for the third time of the season. Hayden started off well, moving up from fourth to second on the opening lap and battling with Stoner at the first half of the race. On lap 11 however, his engine started to lose power, which allowed Rossi to move up to second place. On lap 13, he lost power completely, forcing him to retire. At the last two races of the season—the Malaysian and Valencian Community rounds—Hayden finished ninth and eighth.

Hayden finished eighth in the championship with 127 points, 240 points behind the champion Casey Stoner and 115 points behind runner-up and Factory Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa.

In 2008, Hayden ran his old number 69 since Casey Stoner earned the right to run the number 1 plate after winning the MotoGP title in 2007.

=====2008=====

Hayden finished 10th at the opening race in Qatar and was duly outpaced by his teammate Dani Pedrosa, who finished on the podium in third place. At the next race in Spain, Hayden finished just off the podium in fourth position while his teammate went on to win the race. During the race, he was close to overtaking Jorge Lorenzo, but a mistake with just six laps to go allowed the Spaniard to finish third.

Hayden would register his first and only retirement of the season in Portugal. He had dropped back to seventh on the opening lap, before he fought his way back up to fifth place. A crash by Andrea Dovizioso allowed him to move up into fourth position and he was trying to close down a two-second gap to third place Valentino Rossi, but he lost the front of his bike at turn seven and slid out of contention. In the following five rounds, Hayden would not finish higher than sixth. He finished sixth in China, eighth in France, 13th in Italy, eighth again in Catalunya and seventh in Great Britain. The race in Donington Park also marked the race debut of Honda&#x27;s pneumatic-valve engine, which only Hayden was using initially.

At round nine—the Dutch round in Assen—Hayden ran third from the start and was set to finish there until he ran out of fuel at the final corner, due to an electrical system problem which prevented accurate fuel monitoring. Colin Edwards captured Hayden&#x27;s third-place podium moments before Hayden coasted over the line with no power, to finish in fourth place. At the next two rounds in Germany and his home round at the United States, Hayden finished in 13th and fifth positions. A heel injury sustained in a motocross crash meant that Hayden would not participate in the Czech and San Marino rounds.

As the season went on, the relations within the team had already deteriorated, and there was further friction when Pedrosa switched tire suppliers midseason (from the struggling Michelin to the dominant Bridgestone) without Hayden being consulted. Hayden stated &quot;I&#x27;ve never been put in the conditions to choose. Once they told me that I would have just wasted my time had I even only thought about asking for Bridgestone tires...I&#x27;m not surprised they&#x27;ve given them to him. Besides, at Misano I didn&#x27;t even have the same fork Dani had... No way would I think they&#x27;d let me try the new tires&quot;. This incident lent weight to the rumours that Hayden and Honda would part ways for the next season. The rumour was confirmed on September 12, 2008, when Hayden stated during a Dorna press conference, &quot;It&#x27;s no secret. Everybody knows where my next stop is going to be...But officially we&#x27;re waiting to do it the right way, until the releases come out, because there&#x27;s teams and stuff&quot;.

Despite all the friction and negativity in the media between Hayden and the Repsol Honda team, he would go on to finish the season on a more positive note than last year. In his return race at the inaugural Indianapolis race, he would go on to finish second—his first podium of the season. Hayden started fourth but moved his way up the order, overtaking Valentino Rossi—who had fallen back from pole to fourth position at the start —, his future Ducati teammate Casey Stoner and rookie Andrea Dovizioso on the second lap to take over the lead. After Rossi fought his way back up to second, he would overtake Hayden under wet and tricky conditions down at the main straight on lap 14. With the rain increasing, Hayden started struggling and almost lost second place to the charging Jorge Lorenzo, until the marshalls red-flagged the race with seven laps to go. At the Japanese race, Hayden would finish in fifth position.

Hayden&#x27;s second and last podium of the season, and of his Honda career, would come at the race in Australia. Hayden qualified third while home hero Stoner took pole position. When the lights went out, Stoner was challenged by the &#x27;Kentucky Kid&#x27; for 10 laps, before the Australian started to pull a two-second advantage halfway through the race and a 6.5 second lead at the chequered flag. Hayden—still in second place at the time—was facing a late charging Valentino Rossi, who had worked his way up from 12th after a high-speed qualifying fall on Saturday. Hayden fought hard to keep second place, but ultimately couldn&#x27;t prevent Rossi from taking it on the final lap. At the last two rounds of his Honda career in Malaysia and Valencia, Hayden finished fourth and fifth, respectively.

By the middle of 2008 it was strongly suspected by fans, media, and the MotoGP paddock already, and later supported by Hayden&#x27;s own admission during a press conference that he would be leaving Honda, that Hayden would be joining the Ducati Marlboro Team to ride alongside Casey Stoner for the 2009 MotoGP season. This was confirmed on September 15, 2008 thus ending his 10-year relationship with Honda.

====Ducati (2009–2013)====

=====2009=====

During preseason testing, Hayden was plagued with problems and routinely finished in the mid-pack or lower. His major complaint was that the GP09 was &quot;pumping&quot; during corner exits leading to problems with grip. These problems continued throughout preseason testing.

His first season at Ducati started off badly when, during qualifying at the season opener Qatar round, Hayden suffered from a severe pain in his back and needed three stitches for a cut to his chest after he fell in a major crash. He was launched into the air by a highside at the end of the 45-minute qualifying session when he was trying to improve on his 16th position, and was taken to hospital afterward. After it was declared that Hayden had not broken any bones, he returned in the warm-up session on Sunday and went on to finish 12th in the rain-delayed race, just behind his former teammate Dani Pedrosa. This was also Hayden&#x27;s 100th grand prix. Despite the setbacks, Hayden seemed optimistic about the results saying &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m leaving here in a really positive mood and looking forward to Motegi.&quot;

At the second race in Japan, Hayden had never ridden the Ducati in the rain and qualified 12th. Then, on the opening lap of the race, Hayden was taken out by rookie Yuki Takahashi who plowed through Hayden from the rear under braking for the hairpin. As a result, Hayden retired from the race and slipped further down the standings.

After Motegi, Hayden would continuously underperform compared to teammate Casey Stoner. He would finish 15th in Spain, 12th in France and Italy but would slowly work his way up as the season progressed when he finished 10th in Catalunya, eighth in Netherlands and fifth at his home race in the United States, his best result of the season yet. He finished in eighth place at the German, 15th and a lap down after a poor tire choice at the British and sixth at the Czech rounds. By round 11 however, Stoner already had won two GPs and finished on the podium a further three times.

His breakthrough on the Ducati would come at the Indianapolis round. After qualifying sixth on Saturday, he would move up to fifth and then fourth when Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi crashed out of the race. He then overtook fellow countryman Colin Edwards for third but had to hold off Repsol Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso in the closing stages of the race. He did so and would go on to finish half-a-second clear of Dovizioso, becoming the first Ducati rider other than Stoner to finish on the podium since Loris Capirossi did so at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix.

After his first podium of the season, Hayden would register his second retirement when he got tangled up in an incident caused by Alex de Angelis and Colin Edwards. When de Angelis tried to gain positions during the short right-left turns one and two, he hit Edwards who then clipped the back of Hayden, making them all retire from the race on the opening lap of the San Marino GP. After Misano, Hayden finished eighth in Portugal, 15th in Australia after he crashed once more with Jorge Lorenzo on the opening lap and lost a significant amount of time in the process and fifth twice in Malaysia and Valencia.

Hayden finished 13th in the championship with 104 points, 202 points behind the champion Valentino Rossi and 157 points behind runner-up Jorge Lorenzo, his worst result since he first started racing in the MotoGP class in 2003.

=====2010=====

On September 3, 2009, Ducati said that Hayden had signed a one-year extension of his contract for the 2010 MotoGP season, ending speculation of a move away from the team. He would partner with Casey Stoner once more at the team.

During the off-season, Hayden had surgery on his right arm, having been suffering from compartmental syndrome or more commonly known as arm-pump.

Hayden would, compared to previous years, start off the season well by finishing fourth three consecutive times at the Qatar, Spanish and French rounds. However, his string of good luck would end at the fourth round of the season in Italy when he slid out of sixth place on lap six. After his retirement in Mugello, Hayden would go on to finish fourth in Great Britain, seventh in the Netherlands, eighth in Catalunya, seventh in Germany, fifth in the United States and sixth twice in the Czech Republic and at Indianapolis.

At the San Marino race, Hayden retired once more when he fell on the opening lap and took out Loris Capirossi, damaging his right little finger and requiring surgery in the process. After his second crash of the year, Hayden registered his first podium in the form of third place at the Aragón GP. On the last lap, he overtook the Yamaha of Jorge Lorenzo on the penultimate corner by diving on the inside through the second part of the slow right-left turns 14 and 15 that leads onto the back straight. With Hayden putting his Ducati on the racing line, Lorenzo was forced to back off and that prevented him from retaking the place going into the long, sweeping turn 16, granting Hayden third place. With Casey Stoner winning the race, this marked the first time that two Ducatis finished on the podium since Stoner and Loris Capirossi finished first and second at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.

Hayden spun off on lap two of the Japanese round, along with Ben Spies. Hayden got going again and finished in 12th position. At the Malaysian, Australian and Portuguese rounds, Hayden finished in sixth, fourth and fifth positions, respectively. At the final race in Valencia, Hayden would retire for the third time this season after he lost the front end of his machine and slid into the gravel trap from third place.

Hayden finished seventh in the championship with 163 points, 220 points behind the champion Jorge Lorenzo and 82 points behind runner-up Dani Pedrosa.

=====2011=====

On August 28, 2010, Hayden extended his partnership with Ducati, signing a two-year contract extension with the factory team. He is joined in the team by his former Honda teammate Valentino Rossi, who also signed a two-year deal, to partner Hayden.

Hayden&#x27;s 2011 season started with a ninth-place finish in Qatar, before he achieved a third place at the Spanish round. Having avoided other incidents that eliminated several front-runners from the race, Hayden was aided by a last-lap mechanical failure for Colin Edwards, which caused him to crash out of the race, to take his first podium since the 2010 Aragón race where he also finished in third position.

After his first and only podium of the season at round two, Hayden continued to stay in the points-scoring positions for the next 10 races, including a fastest lap during the British GP. Hayden finished ninth in Portugal, seventh in France, eighth in Catalunya, fourth in Great Britain, fifth in the Netherlands, 10th in Italy, eighth in Germany, seventh twice in the United States and Czech Republic and 14th in Indianapolis. He took top-10 finishes in all but one race, when he finished 14th in his home race at Indianapolis. He finished the race two laps down after making an unscheduled pit stop—having run as high as fifth during the race—after losing grip on his softer-compound Bridgestone front tire, causing a higher amount of wear to the left-hand side of the tire itself.

At the San Marino round, Hayden registered his first retirement of the season. During the rain-affected race, Hayden lost the front on the exit of turn 15 and slid out of contention on lap three. After Misano, Hayden recorded three consecutive seventh-place finishes in Aragón, Japan and Australia to maintain his eighth place in the riders&#x27; championship. The Malaysian Grand Prix—in which Hayden had qualified sixth for—was cancelled after the death of Marco Simoncelli.

At the final race of the season—the Valencian Community round—Hayden retired once more when he was eliminated, along with teammate Rossi, in a four-bike first-corner collision on the opening lap which was caused by the Suzuki of Álvaro Bautista. The incident left Hayden with a broken wrist, and he was forced to miss post-season testing the following week.

Hayden finished eighth in the championship with 132 points, 218 points behind the champion Casey Stoner and 128 points behind runner-up Jorge Lorenzo.

=====2012=====

Hayden remained with Ducati for the 2012 season. For the first 10 races, he finished consistently in the points: sixth in Qatar, eighth in Spain, 11th in Portugal, sixth again in France, ninth in Catalunya, seventh in Great Britain, sixth once more in the Netherlands, 10th in Germany, seventh in Italy and sixth for the fourth time at his home race in the United States.

At the Indianapolis round, Hayden had been expecting the best performance to date for the Ducati team, believing it to be well-suited to the track conditions at the circuit. However, Hayden did not take part in the race after suffering an accident at turn 14 during the qualifying session, trying to improve on his qualifying time. As a result, Hayden suffered a concussion in the process, ruling him out of the race. A fractured right hand also ruled him out of the following race in the Czech Republic.

Although not fully recovered from his injuries, thanks to the support of the official physiotherapist Freddie Dente, Hayden returned for the San Marino GP, where he finished in seventh position.

Hayden failed to finish the Aragon Grand Prix, running wide at the final turn before crashing into a track-side wall at enough speed to launch him over the wall. He finished eighth in Japan and Australia, sandwiching a season&#x27;s best fourth-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix. He crashed out of the final race in Valencia.

Hayden finished ninth in the championship with 122 points, 228 points behind the champion Jorge Lorenzo and 210 points behind runner-up Dani Pedrosa. This was the first time in his career that he did not get a podium finish during the season.

=====2013=====

For the 2013 season, Hayden was joined in the factory Ducati team by Andrea Dovizioso, who moved from the Tech3 Yamaha squad to replace Valentino Rossi, who returned to the factory Yamaha setup. Hayden had stated that Dovizioso was the &quot;best possible choice&quot; to replace Rossi, prior to him signing a contract.

Hayden scored points in the first five races: eighth in Qatar, ninth at the Americas, seventh in Spain, a season-best fifth in France and sixth in Italy.

At round six in Catalunya, Hayden retired for the first time this season. Hayden initially had made up ground, where he went from fifth to eighth, to pass the Pramac Ducati of Andrea Iannone, but would crash out of the race on lap six when the front of his machine let go when he turned into the left-hander at turn 10 after passing Stefan Bradl for fifth place.

He finished 11th in the Netherlands, ninth in Germany, eighth at his home race in the United States, ninth again in Indianapolis, eighth twice in the Czech Republic and Great Britain and ninth twice in San Marino and Aragón.

At the Malaysian GP, Hayden retired once more with mechanical problems. Having started in 11th place, he was forced to stop when his engine failed and blew up in a cloud of smoke at the end of lap eight. After his engine woes in Sepang, Hayden went on to finish the last three races of the season—the Australian, Japanese and Valencian Community rounds—in seventh, ninth and eighth places, respectively.

Hayden finished ninth in the championship with 126 points, 208 points behind the champion Marc Márquez and 204 points behind runner-up Jorge Lorenzo. For the second consecutive season, Hayden did not get a podium finish during the season.

====Aspar Team (2014–2015)====

=====2014=====

It was announced on October 17, 2013, that, after five years with Ducati, Hayden had signed with the Aspar Team for the 2014 season. Hayden partnered Hiroshi Aoyama, who moved from the Avintia Blusens squad, with the pair riding open-specification Honda RCV1000R motorcycles.

At the season opening round in Qatar, Hayden finished in the exact same position as where he finished last year, which is in eighth position. In the following three rounds—the Americas, Argentina and Spanish grands prix—he finished eleventh three consecutive times.

At round five of the season in France, Hayden retired for the first time of the season when he came into contact with the Pramac Ducati of Andrea Iannone at the exit of the first turn on the opening lap.

Hayden did not participate at the Italian race due to a wrist injury, which had lingered since the Spanish GP two races earlier. He expected to return for the next round in Catalunya if the surgery was successful.

After the surgery had been done without any major problems, Hayden returned in Catalunya where he finished 12th. At the Dutch round, Hayden finished outside of the points for the first time since the 2007 British GP but finished in the points again at the next round in Germany with a 14th place.

Hayden missed the Indianapolis, Czech, British and San Marino rounds due to a second round of surgery on his right wrist in July to remove a set of small bones. He returned in Aragón, where he finished ninth in wet-dry conditions which forced him to make a late-race bike swap. This was also his best race result since his opening race result in Losail earlier in the year. In the following two races in Japan and Australia, he finished in 14th and 10th positions, respectively.

At the penultimate round in Malaysia, Hayden registered his second retirement of the year. He crashed out of a top 10 finish at the hairpin. At the last race of the season—the Valencian Community GP—Hayden finished in 13th place.

Hayden finished 16th in the championship with 47 points, 315 points behind the champion Marc Márquez and 248 points behind runner-up Valentino Rossi. For the third consecutive season, Hayden did not get a podium finish during the season.

=====2015=====

For the 2015 season, Hayden remained with the Aspar Racing Team, to ride a new open-specification Honda RC213V-RS. He was joined in the team by Eugene Laverty, who moved across from the Superbike World Championship.

Hayden had the worst start of the season since he started racing in the MotoGP class in 2004. He finished outside of the points at the opening round in Qatar with a 17th place, but fared better at the Americas where he crossed the line in 13th. However, in the following two rounds—the Argentine and Spanish GPs—Hayden finished outside of the points once more when he finished 16th and 17th. At round five in France, he achieved a season-best finish of 11th place and became the top Open-class rider of the race.

At the Italian and Catalan grands prix, Hayden retired two consecutive times. In Mugello, Nicky Hayden crashed out of the race at turn four on the fourth lap and in Catalunya, he was forced wide into the gravel on the opening lap to avoid a collision and then crashed himself on the 14th lap at turn five. Later he stated that he was &quot;annoyed and frustrated&quot; for making so many mistakes that cost him from obtaining a better result at this race.

Hayden failed to score any points for the next four consecutive races—three consecutive 16th positions in the Netherlands, Germany and Indianapolis and one 17th position in the Czech Republic. At round 12 in Great Britain, Hayden finished in 12th place, before failing to score any points once more at the next round in San Marino after finishing in 17th place. In Aragón and Japan, Hayden would score the last points of his MotoGP career by finishing in 15th and 13th places.

At the Australian round, he would retire for the third time this season. He was forced to retire due to technical problems with the bike. At the last two rounds of the season in Malaysia and at the Valencian Community, he finished in 16th and 17th positions.

====Marc VDS Racing Team and Repsol Honda====

Hayden moved to the Superbike World Championship in 2016, but made two one-off spot starts when Honda riders were injured at the 2016 season.

After Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS star Jack Miller was ruled out for the Aragón round, Hayden was called by Honda in a substitute role. He finished the race in 15th position, ensuring that he had scored at least one point in 14 consecutive seasons—every MotoGP season he had so far participated in. He said that he underestimated the task of adapting to the new Michelin tires but that his progress through the weekend was such that he was left longing to qualify and race again.

After Dani Pedrosa was ruled out of racing at the Australian GP due to a broken collarbone he sustained after high-siding during practice for the Japanese round, Hayden was called to replace him for this round. marking his return to the squad since 2008. He finished outside of the points in 17th position after a collision with Jack Miller at turn four fighting for 9th place late in the race —who he had replaced just two rounds earlier—made him slide into the gravel and outside the points.

===Superbike World Championship===
On October 8, 2015, it was announced – at the pre-race press conference for the Japanese Grand Prix – that Hayden would move to the Superbike World Championship for the season. Hayden replaced Sylvain Guintoli at the Ten Kate Racing-run Honda squad, alongside Michael van der Mark.

====2016====
After strong pre-season testing results, Hayden finished his first race weekend with ninth and fourth at Phillip Island. At Assen, round four, Hayden scored his first podium finish with a third place in the opening race, running with the leaders before backing off in the closing stages. At Sepang, round six, Hayden qualified fourth on the grid behind the Kawasakis of Jonathan Rea and Tom Sykes, and the Yamaha of Alex Lowes. After an eighth place in the first race, Hayden made a good start in the damp conditions of the second race, and overtook Lowes into turn two, before challenging the Kawasakis for the lead. Hayden went around the outside of Sykes into turn five and followed Rea for the majority of the lap, making a strong move into the penultimate corner. Hayden established a four-second gap over Rea and the now chasing Ducatis of Chaz Davies and Davide Giugliano. As the race entered the last 10 laps, Giugliano moved into second ahead of Rea and Davies, halving Hayden&#x27;s lead with four laps to go. Giugliano was one second behind coming onto the final lap but Hayden held the gap to win his first World Superbike race, taking Honda&#x27;s first win of the season in the process.

====2017====

Hayden remained at Ten Kate Honda (now known as the Red Bull Honda World Superbike Team) for the 2017 season, partnered by Stefan Bradl. A slow start to the season saw mixed results and three retirements. His best result on the season was a seventh-place finish in Thailand. Hayden&#x27;s final race was the second race of the Motul Italian Round held on May 14, 2017, where he finished in 12th place. He was in 13th place overall in the championship at the time of his death.

== Personal life ==
Hayden was born into a Roman Catholic family with which he retained a strong connection throughout his entire life, even living in an apartment above his family while the rest of the MotoGP riders lived in Europe. He had two brothers, Tommy and Roger Lee, both professional motorcycle racers, and two sisters, Jenny and Kathleen. In 2010, Tommy raced in the AMA, and Roger Lee competed in the Superbike World Championship.

His traditional racing number, 69, was the same number his father Earl used. His father jokes that the number was selected because it could still be read when he frequently ended up upside down in the dirt.

Hayden became engaged to Jackie Marin in May 2016.

==Death==
On May 17, 2017, Hayden was hit by a driver while riding his bicycle near Rimini, Italy. Hayden was riding alone at the time of the accident which took place at around 14:00 CEST (UTC+2). Earlier in the morning Hayden was out running with Kevin Schwantz. He invited Schwantz to ride with him in the afternoon but Schwantz declined as he did not have a bicycle on hand. Hayden then rode briefly with his friend Denis Pazzaglini at some point in the early afternoon. Hayden&#x27;s final Instagram photo shows the two together.

The crash occurred at the intersection of Via Ca&#x27; Raffaelli and Via Tavoleto in Misano Adriatico. Hayden was traveling west on Via Ca&#x27; Raffaelli when he was struck by a Peugeot 206 CC as he entered the street to cross Via Tavoleto. According to Italian newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, a home surveillance camera installed several metres away from the intersection recorded the entire accident. Hayden apparently did not halt at a stop sign and was possibly distracted by his iPod which was found by investigators at the scene of the crash.

The driver of the car stated that he was on his way to work when Hayden passed through a stop sign and suddenly appeared in front of him. He was unable to avoid a collision. The speed of the car was not known but the impact of Hayden slamming into the windshield was strong enough to completely shatter it and dent down the roof of the car. Hayden&#x27;s bicycle was found in the nearby ditch with its frame snapped in half. Riccione Municipal Police are in possession of the crash video and the result of their investigation was expected to be reported some time in July.

Hayden was taken to Rimini hospital with severe injuries, and was subsequently moved to the major trauma unit at the Maurizio Bufalini Hospital in Cesena for possible surgery. Hayden&#x27;s injuries were so severe that he was not placed into a medically induced coma and did not receive any surgery. Whether Hayden was at all conscious or in a natural coma during his last days is not known.

The extent of Hayden&#x27;s injuries was described as polytrauma including a traumatic brain injury that resulted in severe cerebral damage. He also suffered a broken femur, broken pelvis, and multiple fractured vertebrae. As a result of the injuries, Hayden was placed on life support in an intensive care unit. After no signs of recovery, Hayden died in the hospital on May 22, 2017, five days after the accident. He was 35 years old.

In September 2017, results of the accident investigation were released. The report placed 70 percent blame on the driver, and 30 percent blame on Hayden. The report said that the car was traveling at approximately in a zone, and there was no indication that the driver braked prior to colliding with Hayden. Hayden had been traveling at , and entered the intersection without heeding the stop sign.

<text>The largest state-owned hospital in Uganda is Mulago Hospital in Kampala with around 1,500 beds. It was built in 1962.

Ian Clarke, a physician and missionary from Northern Ireland, built the 200-bed International Hospital Kampala, which was the first International Organization for Standardization-certified hospital in the country.

According to a report published in 2009, the distribution of healthcare facilities and funding heavily favored urban centers, with 70 percent of physicians and 40 percent of nurses and midwives based in urban areas, where they served only 12 percent of Uganda&#x27;s population.

<text>Joseph von Führich (fully Josef Ritter von Führich) (9 February 1800 – 13 March 1876) was an Austrian painter, one of the Nazarenes. He painted religious pictures almost exclusively. Führich acquired his greatest fame as a draughtsman.

==Biography==
He was born at Kratzau (today Chrastava) in Bohemia. Deeply impressed as a boy by rustic pictures adorning the wayside chapels of his native country, his first attempt at composition was a sketch of the Nativity for the festival of Christmas in his father&#x27;s house. He lived to see the day when, becoming celebrated as a composer of scriptural episodes, his sacred subjects were transferred in numberless repetitions to the roadside churches of the Austrian state, where peasants thus learnt to admire modern art reviving the models of earlier ages. He learned the elements of art in his father&#x27;s workshop where he practised drawing.

In 1816, his father sent him to the Academy of Prague to study under Joseph Bergler. His first inspiration was derived from the prints of Dürer and Peter von Cornelius&#x27; illustrations to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and the first fruit of this turn of study was the &quot;Genofeva&quot; series. On his journeys to Dresden and Vienna he became fond of Dürer&#x27;s creations.

In 1826 he went to Rome, where he added three frescoes to those executed by Cornelius and Overbeck in the Casino Massimo, showing scenes from Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot;.

Führich was an adherent of the Nazarene movement, a romantic religious artist who sought to restore the spirit of Dürer and give new shape to biblical subjects. Without the power of Peter von Cornelius or the grace of Johann Friedrich Overbeck, he composed with great skill, especially in outline. His mastery of distribution, form, movement and expression was considerable. In its peculiar way his drapery was perfectly cast.

According to an assessment in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;[e]ssentially creative as a landscape draughtsman, he had no feeling for colour; and when he produced monumental pictures he was not nearly so successful as when designing subjects for woodcuts. Führich&#x27;s fame extended far beyond the Austrian capital, and his illustrations to Tieck&#x27;s &quot;Genofeva&quot;, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Triumph of Christ, the Road to Bethlehem, the Succession of Christ according to Thomas a Kempis, the Prodigal Son, and the verses of the Psalter, became well known. His &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, especially, is remarkable for the fancy with which the spirit of evil is embodied in a figure constantly recurring, and like that of Mephistopheles exhibiting temptation in a human yet demoniacal shape.&quot;

The year 1829 saw him again in Prague. In 1831 he finished the &quot;Triumph of Christ&quot;, later in the Raczynski palace at Berlin. In 1834 he was made &quot;custos&quot; and in 1841 professor of composition in the Academy of Vienna. After this he completed the monumental pictures of the church of St Nepomuk, and in 1854–61 a vast series of wall paintings which cover the inside of the Lerchenfeld church at Vienna. In 1872 he was pensioned and made a knight of the order of Franz Joseph; 1875 is the date of his illustrations to the Psalms.

Führich died in Vienna. His autobiography was published in 1875, and a memoir by his son Lucas in 1886.

<text>Crianlarich (; ) is a village in Stirling council area and in the registration county of Perthshire, Scotland, around north-east of the head of Loch Lomond. The village bills itself as &quot;the gateway to the Highlands&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Crianlarich&quot; is derived probably from the Gaelic meaning either &quot;the wasted site&quot; or &quot;the aspen site&quot; (c.f. Gaelic &quot;critheann&quot;, &quot;aspen&quot;).

==Situation==
The village lies in the valley of Strath Fillan at the north western extent of the Trossachs, in the shadow of several Munro peaks, notably Ben More, but also Stob Binnein and Cruach Ardrain. Thus Crianlarich is very popular with hillwalkers. Also the village lies along the long-distance footpath, the West Highland Way.

Its location makes Crianlarich a popular stop for tourists and there are a variety of types of overnight accommodation including guesthouses, B&amp;Bs, a youth hostel operated by Hostelling Scotland, and a Best Western hotel.

==Transport connections==
Crianlarich has been a major crossroads for north- and westbound journeys in Scotland since medieval times.

In the 1750s, two military roads met in the village; in the 19th century, it became a railway junction on what is now the West Highland Line; in the 20th century it became the meeting point of the major A82 and A85 roads. As such, it is designated a primary destination in Scotland, signposted from as far as Glasgow in the south, Perth in the east, Oban in the west and Fort William in the north. In the 1960s there was even a direction sign for Crianlarich at Swiss Cottage at Camden in London. Since 2016 the A82 by-passes the centre of the village to avoid the low railway bridge.

The village is served by Crianlarich railway station located on the West Highland Line. The routes to Fort William/Mallaig and Oban diverge after this station. Access to the platform is via a flight of stairs from a subway that runs underneath the tracks, from the car park which is slightly lower than the station itself.

It is also served by a Scottish Citylink coach service up to hourly from Glasgow going on about every two hours to either Oban or Fort William.

In 2001, the village had a population of 185.

==Lochan Saorach==
In nearby Glen Dochart lies Lochan Saorach, mentioned by Thomas Pennant in 1769 on account of the floating island it once contained.

<text>Rathausball-Tänze op. 438 is a waltz by composer Johann Strauss II written in 1890 in honour of the inauguration of the new city hall of Vienna (the &#x27;Rathaus&#x27;). At the opening of the new banqueting hall (Festsaal) on 12 February 1890 two rival orchestras were commissioned to provide dance music for the occasion; the Strauss Orchestra under the direction of Eduard Strauss, and that of rival Kapellmeister Karl Michael Ziehrer who was head of the Vienna House Regiment &#x27;Hoch und Deutschmeister No. 4&#x27;.

The waltz incorporates many snatches of &quot; The Blue Danube&quot; waltz op. 314; much of the coda is based on Haydn&#x27;s Austrian hymn Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser. As a consequence the coda is one of the first in a Strauss not to recall themes from earlier sections.

Ziehrer&#x27;s waltz, the &quot;Wiener Bürger&quot; waltz op. 419 remained the more popular of the two works presented. This marked the first of the many occasions where after Johann Strauss II&#x27;s death, his brother Eduard Strauss often found himself at rivalry with Ziehrer.

Johann Strauss was evidently bitter at his &#x27;musical defeat&#x27;. In a letter to his publisher of the waltz, Fritz Simrock, in 1892 he pointed out an error in the score which he claimed &#x27;spoiled the entire melody&#x27; and that the publisher had &#x27;effectively mutilated him&#x27; before amusingly adding &#x27;After that, am I supposed to say &#x27;with best wishes&#x27;? Yes, I&#x27;ll say it anyway!&#x27;.

<text>Newman Centers, Newman Houses, Newman Clubs, or Newman Communities are Catholic campus ministry centers at secular universities. The movement was inspired by the writings of Cardinal John Henry Newman encouraging societies for Catholic students attending secular universities.

These centers may include residential living space or may be actual houses close to the campus with or without a chapel. Activities vary among centers but usually include both spiritual worship like Sunday Mass and Eucharistic adoration, social get-togethers (like movies or coffee socials), and group outings (like apple picking, March for Life events, and amusement park visits).

==History==
The first Newman club was established at Oxford University by Hartwell de la Garde Grissell in 1878 as Oxford University Catholic Club, which was renamed in 1888 the Oxford University Newman Society.

The “Newman Movement” in the United States began in 1883 at the University of Wisconsin when Catholic students joined to form the Melvin Club, named after their hosts, Mr. and Mrs. John C. Melvin. The first Newman Club in America was established in 1893 at the University of Pennsylvania by Timothy Harrington, a graduate medical student and former member of the Wisconsin group, together with John Gilbride, James and Joseph Walsh with assistance of Father P. J. Garvey, pastor of the local St. James Catholic Church. The club provided social activities, discussions on the faith, and mutual support for Catholic students in a sometimes hostile academic environment. The meetings were occasions to experience Catholic culture in a secular environment.

Cornell had one of the first Newman Clubs, organized in 1888. The Newman Club eventually became a full-fledged campus parish, the Cornell Catholic Community.

In the early 1900s, the majority of Catholic college students attended private Catholic institutions. However, over time, a growing number of Catholics began attending secular universities. Initially, small chapels were opened near the campuses of the secular universities.

In 1908, the Catholic clubs began an association which became the National Newman Club Federation. In 1950, the National Newman Chaplains Association was established for ordained chaplains at non-Catholic colleges and universities. In 1969, the National Newman Chaplains Association became Catholic Campus Ministry Association (CCMA).

According to The Newman Connection, a US Catholic Church Campus Ministries non-profit organization, there are over 2,000 Newman Centers in the United States.

==Ministry and services==
The centers provide pastoral services and ministries to their Catholic communities, in particular to the Roman Catholic student population within the universities. However, since these centers are located on university campuses, those of other Christian denominations often come and participate as well. A variety of university and parish related meetings and social events take place at the centers, as well as personal events including Catholic weddings, anniversary celebrations, baptisms, masses and funeral receptions.

==United States==
Examples of campuses with Newman Centers include:
St. John&#x27;s Catholic Newman Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign—formerly known as the Newman Foundation—is the largest in the nation and has been considered one of the model Newman Centers in the United States. The center encompasses three main entities: St. John&#x27;s Catholic Chapel, Newman Hall, and the Institute of Catholic Thought. It is one of the few Newman Centers that also encompasses a large undergraduate residence, Newman Hall, through the university&#x27;s Certified Private Housing program, having over 600 live-in residents, a cafeteria, and other services.

The Newman Center at Troy University in Troy, Alabama is a coed residence hall which opened in 2013. The Newman Halls will house 376 residents, 6 resident assistants, and one live-in married couple who acts as the community directors.

Blessed Pope John Paul II Newman Center at the University of Illinois, Chicago serves the largest Catholic student population in the Midwest and one of the largest in the country. UIC has 25,000+ students, of which over 15,000 are Catholic. The John Paul II Newman Center in 1999 established the Arthur J. Schmitt Chair in Catholic studies for students to study the Catholic faith and receive college credit for doing so. Currently, students may receive a minor in Catholic studies. Of the other programs which the John Paul II Newman Center offers, Vocation Discernment averages 10-15 students each year who study to become priests and religious brothers and sisters. The Integritas Institute for Ethics, a third program, teaches ethics and morality. The John Paul II Newman Center is in the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago.

St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Center at Texas A&amp;M University decided to turn their permanent parishioners into volunteers for the campus ministry and discontinued all other parish programs not related directly to campus ministry. Two hundred families stayed and the rest went to the other parish in College Station. The Catholic Campus Ministry Association has given presentations before national audiences concerning the success of St. Mary&#x27;s.

The National Catholic Student Coalition in Delaware was created in 1982 and was the successor of the Newman Center and the National Federation of Catholic College Students.

==Canada==
Newman Centre, Toronto is housed in the historical W.D. Matthews House. It is under the direction of the Archdiocese of Toronto and is associated with the neighbouring St. Thomas Aquinas Church.

The Newman Centre in Montreal, which serves McGill University and the Archdiocese of Montreal goes back to the Columbian Club (est. 1897) and the Newman Club (est. 1929). In 1941, the Rev. Gerald Emmett Carter (later Cardinal Archbishop of Toronto) was appointed director. In 1949, under his leadership, the club acquired a new home, &quot;Newman House,&quot; located centrally on McGill College Avenue, one block south of the Roddick Gates. In 1951, the Newman Association of Montreal was created (incorporated under the Bighops&#x27; Act). The association&#x27;s purpose would be to support the Catholic community at McGill University. In 1954 the Newman Association purchased the La Fleur mansion located at 3484 Peel Street, which remains the centre&#x27;s Montreal address to this day. In 1998 the Newman Institute of Catholic Studies was established under the direction of Dr. Daniel Cere. The Newman Institute of Catholic Studies was federally incorporated in 2000, when the Catholic Studies minor concentration was established at McGill University, along with the Kennedy Smith Chair in Catholic Studies.

==Australia==
University of Queensland and Charles Sturt University are both house Newman Centres.

==New Zealand==
A Newman Society, along the lines of the one at Oxford University, was first set up at the New Zealand University in 1909.

<text>Charles Pierre Henri Rieu (June 8, 1820 – March 19, 1902) was a Swiss orientalist and Professor of Arabic in London and Cambridge.

==Biography==
Rieu was born in Geneva, the son of soldier and politician Jean-Louis Rieu. He studied at Bonn University, where he studied Arabic under Georg Freytag and Johann Gildemeister, and Sanskrit with Christian Lassen. He received his doctorate in 1843. He entered the British Museum in 1847, and after twenty years of service, a new post, that of Keeper of Oriental Manuscripts, was created for him.

He was a Professor of Arabic and Persian at University College London. In 1895 he was made professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge, with the full title &quot;Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic&quot;, in succession to Robertson Smith.

Rieu died in London on 19 March 1902. He was the father of E. V. Rieu and of Sir Louis Rieu.

==Publications==
Rieu completed in 1871 the second part, dealing with Arabic manuscripts, of the &quot;Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum orientalium&quot;, which had been begun by William Cureton, and he issued a supplementary volume in 1894.

He also drew up a &quot;Catalogue of the Turkish Manuscripts&quot; (1888) and a &quot;Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts&quot; (4 vols, 1879–95), the latter being a storehouse of information on the books and their authors.

<doc id="1238037" wikidata="Q8015495" url="?curid=1238037" title="William McMaster">
<text>William McMaster (24 December 1811 – 22 September 1887) was a Canadian wholesaler, senator and banker in the 19th century. A director of the Bank of Montreal from 1864 to 1867, he was a driving force behind the creation of the Canadian Bank of Commerce of which he was the founding president from 1867 to his death in 1887.

He sat in the Senate of Canada from 1867 to 1887 as a Liberal. He also helped found McMaster University in Toronto (later moved to Hamilton), Ontario.

==Biography==
Born in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, McMaster migrated to York, Upper Canada, (now Toronto) in 1833. He was married for the first time to Mary Henderson (1812–1869) of New York. He married a second time on 18 July 1871, to Susan Fraser (née Moulton), the widow of a James Fraser, an Indian Paymaster for the United States government.

He died in 1887 and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto with his first wife Mary with second wife Susan buried at Mont Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

==Philanthropy==
McMaster supported a number of causes with large donations. As a member of Bond Street Baptist Church, McMaster helped to finance its building of larger facilities at Jarvis Street Baptist Church. He also helped to finance Beverley Street Baptist Church, which is now Toronto Chinese Baptist Church, and a number of other Baptist churches in the Toronto area as well as the building of Toronto Baptist College in McMaster Hall on Bloor Street, later renamed McMaster University and funded by a large endowment upon his death. Through his wife, financing was also provided for the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.

<text>.pn is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Pitcairn Islands.

==Use==
An official .pn domain costs $100 per year from the registry. There are relatively few sites using these domains, but examples include ESPN, Experian, C-SPAN, happn, and Groupon, each of whom use the domain for URL shortening services.

Subdomains under various two-letter .pn domains were offered as free redirections and as domain names by numerous providers. In August 2017, Free EU Hosting, one such provider, announced that due to reputation fears they will be discontinuing their popular eu.pn and me.pn subdomains and that they will eventually stop working, offering existing customers alternative subdomains.

The .pn domain is also used as part of a Lionsgate marketing campaign promoting the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; film series, presenting it as the &quot;official&quot; country code of the fictional nation of Panem, with domains for the Capitol and the rebellion.

==Management==
ICANN originally delegated the management of the domain to islander Tom Christian. In 2000, the government of Pitcairn Island wrote a letter to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority stating that Christian did not &quot;adequately serve the interests of the country and community of Pitcairn Island&quot; and requesting reassignment of the delegation of the top-level domain to the office of the governor of Pitcairn Island. The dispute was resolved when ICANN ruled that the domain would be re-delegated to the Pitcairn Island Council.

== Structure ==

The registrations are taken directly at the second level, and at third level under a number of reserved second level domains.

<text>Abies grandis (grand fir, giant fir, lowland white fir, great silver fir, western white fir, Vancouver fir, or Oregon fir) is a fir native to northwestern North America, occurring at altitudes of sea level to . It is a major constituent of the Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion of the Cascade Range.

The tree typically grows to in height, and may be the tallest &quot;Abies&quot; species in the world. There are two varieties, the taller coast grand fir, found west of the Cascade Mountains, and the shorter interior grand fir, found east of the Cascades. It was first described in 1831 by David Douglas.

It is closely related to white fir. The bark was historically believed to have medicinal properties, and it is popular in the United States as a Christmas tree. Its lumber is a softwood, and it is harvested as a hem fir. It is used in paper-making, as well as construction for framing and flooring, where it is desired for its resistance to splitting and splintering.

==Description==
&quot;Abies grandis&quot; is a large evergreen conifer growing to tall, exceptionally , with a trunk diameter of up to . The dead tree tops sometimes fork into new growth. The bark is thick, reddish to gray (but purple within), furrowed, and divided into slender plates. The leaves are needle-like, flattened, long and wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy dark green above, with two green-white bands of stomata below, and slightly notched at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie in two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot. On the lower leaf surface, two green-white bands of stomata are prominent. The base of each leaf is twisted a variable amount so that the leaves are nearly coplanar.

The green-to-reddish cones are long and broad, with about 100–150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged seeds are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after pollination.
===Varieties===
There are two varieties, probably better treated at subspecies rank though not yet formally published as such:
* &quot;Abies grandis&quot; var. &quot;grandis&quot;. Coast grand fir. Coastal lowland forests, at sea level to 900 m altitude, from Vancouver Island and coastal British Columbia, south to Sonoma County, California. A large, very fast-growing tree to 70 m tall. Foliage strongly flattened on all shoots. Cones slightly narrower (mostly less than 4 cm broad), with thinner, fairly flexible scales. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -25° to -30 °C; growth on good sites may exceed 1.5 m per year when young.
* &quot;Abies grandis&quot; var. &quot;idahoensis&quot;. Interior grand fir. Interior forests, at (600–) 900–1800 m altitude, on the east slope of the Cascades in Washington and in the Rocky Mountains from southeast British Columbia south to central Idaho, northeast Oregon and western Montana. A smaller, slow-growing tree to 40–45 m tall. Foliage not strongly flattened on all shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot, particularly on upper crown shoots. Cones slightly stouter (mostly over 4 cm broad), with thicker, slightly woody scales. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -40 °C; growth on good sites not exceeding 0.6 m per year even when young.

Grand fir is very closely related to white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), and intergrades with it in central Oregon. Firs of the Blue Mountains and Oregon East Cascade Slope are intermediate between the two species in genetics and appearance. The intergrades are often referred to as &quot;Abies grandis x concolor&quot;, a variety which itself intergrades into &quot;Abies concolor lowiana&quot; farther south, around the California state line.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by Scottish botanical explorer David Douglas, who in 1830 brought its seeds back to Britain; in 1831 he described specimens he had collected along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The coastal variety of grand fir grows in temperate rainforest environments along the Pacific coast from southwest British Columbia to Northern California, with the inland variety growing in montane conifer forests of eastern Washington, the Idaho Panhandle, and far western Montana. It can be found growing at elevations of up to . Habitats typically receive at least of annual rainfall, but are still too dry or outside the range of more shade-tolerant competitors like western hemlock and western redcedar. Along with the closely related white fir, grand fir is more shade tolerant than Douglas-fir.

==Ecology==
Due to wildfire suppression, grand fir was able to proliferate in areas previously dominated by the relatively fire-resistant inland Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and western larch. The lack of smaller fires allows both grand and white fir saplings to form a fuel ladder, enabling crown fires. Grand fir&#x27;s bark is thinner than that of white fir, making the former species more susceptible to threats like fire and rot.

Specimens have historically been able to live up to nearly 300 years, but in modern stressed conditions, 100 years is more typical. A number of defoliating insects threaten the tree; in the late 20th century, western spruce budworm epidemics killed sizable populations of grand fir in the eastern Cascades and Blue Mountains. The lack of an ability to use pitch to patch wounds, including those from logging and small fires, provides a weakness exploited by rot fungi. East of the Cascade ridge, grand fir trunks are infected by Indian paint fungus, indicating a rotten core; such specimens are often waterlogged and thus crack apart in freezing weather.

Pileated woodpeckers search grand and white firs for insects and places to nest. Rotten cores open shelters for various animals, including black bears.

==Uses==
The boughs create a rain shelter for humans.

Native Americans used both grand fir and white fir, powdering the bark or pitch to treat tuberculosis or skin ailments; the Nlaka&#x27;pamux used the bark to cover lodges and make canoes, and branches were used as bedding. The inner bark of the grand fir was used by some Plateau Indian tribes for treating colds and fever.
The Okanagan-Colville tribe used the species as a strengthening drug to nullify the feeling of weakness.

The foliage has an attractive citrus-like scent. It is sometimes used for Christmas decorations in the United States, including Christmas trees, although its stiff branches do not allow it to be economically packed. It is also planted as an ornamental tree in large parks.

===Timber===
The lumber is non-resinous and fine textured.
In the North American logging industry, the grand fir is often referred to as &quot;hem fir&quot;, with hem fir being a number of species with interchangeable types of wood (specifically the California red fir, noble fir, Pacific silver fir, white fir, and western hemlock). Grand fir is often shipped along with these other species. It can also referred to as &quot;white fir&quot; lumber, an umbrella term also referring to &quot;Abies amabilis&quot;, &quot;Abies concolor&quot;, and &quot;Abies magnifica&quot;.

Lumber from the grand fir is considered a softwood. As such, it is used for paper making, packing crates, and construction. Hem fir is frequently used for framing, and is able to meet the building code span requirements of numerous construction projects.

As a hem fir, the trunk of the grand fir is considered slightly below the &quot;Douglas fir-larch&quot; species combination in strength, and stronger than the &quot;Douglas fir-South&quot; and &quot;spruce-pine-fir (South)&quot; species combos (both umbrella terms for a number of species with similar wood). Because it is nearly as strong as Douglas fir-larch, it often meets the structural load-bearing requirements for framing in residential, light commercial, and heavy construction. Excluding Douglas fir-larch, hem fir&#x27;s modulus of elasticity value as a stiffness factor in floor systems (denoted as MOE or E) is stronger than all other western species combinations. Hem fir is preferred by many builders because of its ability to hold and not be split by nails and screws, and its low propensity for splintering when sawed.

== Notable specimens ==
In February 2022, a coast grand fir growing south of Bergen was found to be Norway&#x27;s tallest tree with height of .

<doc id="1238052" wikidata="Q4834748" url="?curid=1238052" title="BBC2 Floodlit Trophy">
<text>The BBC2 Floodlit Trophy (also known as the BBC2 Television Trophy) was an annual knockout competition for British rugby league clubs. Organised by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the competition was open to all professional clubs with floodlights installed.

First held in 1965–66, games were typically played during the middle of the week, and were broadcast on BBC television. Eight teams competed during the first season, but the tournament was quickly expanded as more teams erected floodlights at their grounds.

The competition&#x27;s most successful club was Castleford, who won the trophy four times, including the inaugural tournament. The last staging of the competition was in 1979–80, won by Hull, before the competition was cancelled due to financial cutbacks by the BBC.

==History==
The tournament was not Rugby League&#x27;s first foray into evening television; the 1955–56 season saw a tournament titled the Independent Television Floodlit Trophy. Eight clubs participated in a series of games played at football grounds in the London area, with Warrington eventually running out 43–18 victors over Leigh.

In 1965, the rugby league management committee agreed to the televising of a mid-week floodlit competition consisting of eight teams, with director of BBC2, broadcaster David Attenborough, being instrumental in its creation. When the competition was first mooted only a few grounds were equipped with floodlights, but the tournament prompted several clubs to apply for loans from the Rugby Football League to install them. The tournament was intended to coincide with the launch of BBC2 in the North of England.

The tournament was played during the early part of the season. Each week, one match would be played under floodlights on a Tuesday evening; the second half of this match that would be broadcast live on BBC2. Non-televised matches were played at various times, depending on clubs&#x27; commitments in more prestigious tournaments. Despite the title many matches did not take place under floodlights; clubs such as Barrow and Bramley (for example) did not possess adequate lighting.

The first season, 1965–66, eight clubs - Castleford, Leeds, Leigh, Oldham, St. Helens, Swinton, Warrington and Widnes took part. Seven of the eight teams had floodlights and Leeds installed theirs the following season.

The four-tackles-then-a-scrum rule was first introduced in the competition&#x27;s second season, in October 1966, before being implemented in all competitions by December.

Castleford won the trophy in the first season, 1965–66 and won the trophy the most times, on three more occasions 1966–67, 1967–68 and 1976–77.

Despite disagreements over shirt sponsorship in the early 1970s, Rugby League remained a mainstay of BBC Television during the 1970s, and 1980s, although the commitment to the Floodlit Trophy decreased before financial cutbacks at the BBC lead to its cancellation after the 1979–80 competition. In the last final, Hull F.C. beat local rivals Hull Kingston Rovers.

<text>Glenn Ingvar Hysén (; born 30 October 1959) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a defender. Starting off his career with IFK Göteborg in 1978, he went on represent PSV Eindhoven, Fiorentina, and Liverpool before retiring at GAIS in 1994. A full international between 1981 and 1990, he won 68 caps for the Sweden national team and represented his country at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He was awarded Guldbollen as Sweden&#x27;s best footballer of the year in both 1983 and 1988.

==Early life==
Glenn Ingvar Hysén was born in Gothenburg to a football family. His grandfather Erik Hysén played for IFK Göteborg as did his great-uncle Carl Hysén. Hysén&#x27;s father Kurt Hysén also played for IFK Göteborg&#x27;s B-Team. Hysén started playing football at IF Warta when he was a boy. As a child, he wanted to become a member of Swedish pop group ABBA.

== Club career ==

===IFK Göteborg===
Hysén started his professional career with IFK Göteborg and made his competitive debut for the team on 14 May 1979 in an Allsvenskan game against IFK Norrköping that ended 2–2. During his first stint with Göteborg, he helped the team win the 1982 and 1983 Swedish Championships, and the 1981–82 UEFA Cup.

=== PSV Eindhoven ===
He was named Sweden&#x27;s Footballer of the Year in 1983 and his form earned him a move to PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands. He was often forced to play out of position, midfielder and even as a forward, and did not enjoy his time in the Netherlands.

=== Return to IFK Göteborg ===
In 1985, he returned to IFK Göteborg and helped the team reach the semi-finals of the 1985–86 European Cup before being eliminated by FC Barcelona on penalty kicks. He also helped the club win another Swedish Championship in 1987 and win their second UEFA Cup title in 1987.

===Fiorentina===
Following his success with IFK Göteborg and the Sweden national team, Hysén turned down an offer from Manchester United and their manager Alex Ferguson to instead join his former IFK Göteborg manager Sven-Göran Eriksson at Fiorentina in Serie A.

===Liverpool===
Manchester United again expressed an interest in signing Hysén in 1989, and invited the player over to England for a tour of Old Trafford and buffet lunch. He returned to Italy with the deal all but sealed; Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards even rang Alex Ferguson to report that Hysén had shaken hands on the deal. Negotiations stalled on the £300,000 transfer, and Edwards and Ferguson flew out to Italy to conclude matters in person. However, upon arrival in Florence, they were told by Hysén&#x27;s agent that the player had signed for Liverpool a few days previously, prompting the United management to make a move for Gary Pallister instead.

Hysén made a sensational debut against Arsenal in the 1989 Charity Shield win at Wembley which made him an instant hero. Hysén settled in immediately at Liverpool, scoring his first Liverpool goal in their club record 9–0 mauling of Crystal Palace soon afterwards. He scored Liverpool&#x27;s eighth goal in this game, which was notable for having eight different players score for the same side.

Alongside veteran club captain Alan Hansen and, in Hansen&#x27;s injury-enforced absence, the young defender Gary Ablett, Hysén was a major part of Liverpool&#x27;s success in the League championship of the 1989–90 season, when the Reds fought off a late challenge from Aston Villa and sealed their 18th top division title by a margin of nine points.

It went slightly downhill for Hysén thereafter, with Hansen out with a long-term injury (which led to his retirement). Manager Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s resignation in February 1991 heralded the beginning of Hysén&#x27;s end. The new manager Graeme Souness did not really share Dalglish&#x27;s views on football which led to many changes being made upon his arrival, changes that did not suit the entire team and created some tension between him and some of the players, Hysén being one of those players. This tension together with some minor injuries made Souness less keen to keep him. Hysén did recover fitness for the 1991–92 season, but made just five league appearances, the last a 3–0 loss to Norwich City 22 February 1992, before being given a free transfer.

===GAIS and retirement===
He returned to Sweden in 1992 and played three seasons for GAIS before retiring from professional football in 1994.

== International career ==
Hysén represented the Sweden U17, U19, and U21 teams a total of 25 times between 1976 and 1980. He made his full international debut for the Sweden national team on 6 March 1981 against Northern Ireland. He continued to play for the Sweden national team for the next nine years. In a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification match on 19 October 1988 against England at Wembley Stadium, Hysén was awarded six &quot;wasps&quot; out of five by &quot;Expressen&quot; for a heroic defensive performance. Hysén captained Sweden at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, when they lost all three of their first-round matches and went home surprisingly early.

== Coaching career ==
Hysén has been assistant coach for Torslanda IK. This experience landed him a spot on reality show &quot;FC Z&quot; which takes 15 men between the ages of 18 and 31 who have never played football before and trains them so they can play against a real team. On the show, he is the coach of the football team FC Zulu which was pinned against his son Tobias&#x27;s former team, Djurgårdens IF.

In November 2010, Glenn Hysén signed a contract making him co-head coach of Swedish division II team Utsiktens BK.

==Personal life==
Hysén and his first wife Kerstin had two children. On 9 March 1982 Tobias was born and three years later daughter Charlotte arrived. Kerstin and Glenn divorced.

He married his second wife Helena and had three children. The first of which was son Alexander, who was born on 12 May 1987. That same year, the family moved to Italy, while Hysén was playing for Fiorentina. Whilst Hysén was playing for Fiorentina, a man proposed to Helena and Hysén chased after him and threw him up against a wall, which he revealed in his biography. Hysén and Helena had son Anton, who was born in 1990, and a daughter, Annie, born in 1994.

=== Television ===
After Hysén&#x27;s retirement from football, he has worked as an expert commentator for TV6 and TV3 in Sweden. At the end of each transmission, he appoints three football players for the game&#x27;s best player. He now works as a commentator for TV2 in Norway.

Hysén competed as a celebrity dancer in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance 2014&quot; being the third to be eliminated.

Since 2014 Hysén is also an ambassador for the gaming company Unibet, and the cleaning company Sweden &amp; Co.

=== Incident at Frankfurt Airport ===
At Frankfurt Airport in 2001, Hysén attacked a man who had groped him while in the public restroom. In 2007, Hysén spoke at Stockholm Pride, the largest gay pride festival in the Nordic region. Many people from the gay community were surprised due to the earlier incident. At the Stockholm Pride, he delivered a speech denouncing sports homophobia and laid to rest his 2001 airport incident.

He said, &quot;I know that many LGBT people have been the victims of assaults and hate crimes. I can therefore understand if some people have been upset by the airport incident, so I want to be clear: I think that it is completely unacceptable that anybody should be subjected to assaults, insults or hate crimes due to their sexual orientation or gender identity...The incident had been blown out of proportion in the media...In order to finally flush the Frankfurt Airport punch down the toilet: it is not the case that I beat up a gay person. I categorically deny that. ...I&#x27;m not proud that I took a swing at him, but I am proud that I have integrity and that I reacted.&quot;

In the same speech he asked &quot;How easy would it be for a sixteen-year-old boy who plays football to come out as gay to his team mates?&quot; In March 2011 his youngest son, Anton, a professional footballer himself, came out of the closet to the media.

<text>Alexander Markovich Polyakov (; born 27 September 1945) is a Russian theoretical physicist, formerly at the Landau Institute in Moscow and, since 1989, at Princeton University, where he is the Joseph Henry Professor of Physics Emeritus.

==Important discoveries==
Polyakov is known for a number of fundamental contributions to quantum field theory, including work on what is now called the &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole in non-Abelian gauge theory, independent from Gerard &#x27;t Hooft. Polyakov and coauthors discovered the so-called BPST instanton which, in turn, led to the discovery of the vacuum angle in QCD. His path integral formulation of string theory had profound and lasting impacts on the conceptual and mathematical understanding of the theory. His paper &quot;Infinite conformal symmetry in two-dimensional quantum field theory&quot; written with Alexander Belavin and Alexander Zamolodchikov laid down the foundations of two-dimensional conformal field theory and has classic status. Polyakov also played an important role in elucidating the conceptual framework behind renormalization independent of Kenneth G. Wilson&#x27;s Nobel Prize–winning work. He formulated pioneering ideas in gauge/string duality long before the breakthrough of AdS/CFT using D-branes. Other insightful conjectures that came years or even decades before active work by others include integrability of gauge and string theories and certain ideas about turbulence.

Very early in his career, in a 1965 student work, Polyakov suggested (with Alexander Migdal) a dynamical Higgs mechanism, slightly after but independently from the publications of Peter Higgs and others. The paper was delayed by the Editorial Office of JETP, and was published only in 1966.

==Honors and awards==
Alexander Polyakov was awarded the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1986, the Lorentz Medal in 1994, the Oskar Klein Medal in 1996, the Harvey Prize in 2010, the Lars Onsager Prize (together with A. Belavin and A. Zamolodchikov) in 2011 and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2013. On 19 November 2020 the German Physical Society announced it would award Alexander Polyakov the 2021 Max Planck Medal.

Polyakov was elected to the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1984, to the French Academy of Sciences in 1998 and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 2005.
== Political positions ==
In February-March 2022, he signed an open letter by Russian scientists condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and another open letter by Breakthrough Prize laureates with the same message.

<doc id="1238065" wikidata="Q2383324" url="?curid=1238065" title="Baadasssss!">
<text>Baadasssss! is a 2003 American biographical drama film, written, produced, directed by, and starring Mario Van Peebles. The film is based on the struggles of Van Peebles&#x27; father Melvin Van Peebles (played by Mario himself), as he attempts to film and distribute &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, a film that was widely credited with showing Hollywood that a viable African-American audience existed, and thus influencing the creation of the blaxploitation genre. The film also stars Joy Bryant, Nia Long, Ossie Davis, Paul Rodriguez, Rainn Wilson, and Terry Crews.

==Plot==
A mock documentary opens the film with the actors (in character as the production crew members) reflecting on the tumultuous events of the 1960s. As the Vietnam War continues, stereotypical depictions of Black Americans in cinema persist.

In 1970, Melvin Van Peebles, who had finished &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; for Columbia Pictures, contemplates his next film project. Peebles&#x27; talent agent Howie Kaufman advises him to follow up with a comedy. After brainstorming in the Mojave Desert, Pebbles outlines his vision for the film, which includes that the film must be entertaining, commercially viable, and represents the Black community.

Titling his project &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, Peebles sends a story treatment to Kaufman who questions the story&#x27;s anti-police themes. Peebles&#x27; friend Bill Harris agrees to arrange the financing but declines Peebles&#x27; request to have the unionized film crew be 50 percent Black. Sometime later, Peebles watches an adult film produced by Clyde Houston. At an ADR session, Houston agrees to join the film as a production manager. Harris finds one investor named Bert, who agrees to finance the film. However, Peebles withdraws from the offer after Bert exposes himself near his house pool.

At a nightclub, Peebles and Harris meet Donovan, a hippie, who agrees to finance the film. On the studio lot, Peebles auditions several actors for the title role. Despite not being hired, Peebles hires them for supporting acting roles. He later hires &quot;Big T&quot;, a crew member who works as the sound assistant and head of security. Peebles&#x27; secretary Priscilla, who has turned every situation into an audition, is given a role in the film. When Peebles has assembled his crew, he learns Donovan has been arrested, which threatens the production that has only raised over $72,000. Before filming begins, Peebles casts himself in the lead role. Priscilla however decides to back out of production because her boyfriend does not approve. She is recast by Ginnie, whom Peebles had met at Donovan&#x27;s party.

Deciding to go independent, Peebles tricks the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) into believing the film is a porno. To save on cost, Peebles films certain scenes on 16 mm and casts his son Mario in the film. This causes an argument with Sandra, Peebles&#x27; girlfriend, who finds Mario&#x27;s participation in the film to be inappropriate. On set, Priscilla&#x27;s boyfriend Maurice White asks Peebles to compose the score to help promote his then-unknown group Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

As filming continues, Peebles learns his production crew have been arrested for alleged grand theft. To help finish the picture, Bill Cosby loans $50,000, which Peebles partially uses to help bail out his crew members. With three days left, &quot;Big T&quot; threatens to leave the production, but Peebles convinces him to stay because of the film&#x27;s potential significance to the community. During post-production, Harris hires an editor, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire records the soundtrack. While editing, Peebles receives a threatening phone call, demanding their loans be repaid immediately. Under immense pressure, Peebles disregards his eye infection, and finishes the final cut.

Peebles tries to sell the film to distributors, but they decline. Kaufman arranges Peebles to meet with Jerry Gross of Cinemation Industries, who initially cautions about marketing the film. Gross eventually agrees to distribute, and Peebles meets with twin theater owners, Manny and Mort Goldberg. They agree to screen the film but it fails to find an audience. Before they pull the film, participants of the Black Panther Party arrive to see the film. Before long, &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; becomes the highest-grossing independent film of 1971, and the soundtrack becomes a success.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; named it one of the best films of the year. &quot;Baadasssss!&quot; was nominated for several &quot;best of&quot; Independent Spirit and NAACP Image awards for 2005, including best feature, director, actor and screenplay. It was listed in the African-American Film Critics Association&#x27;s top-ten films of 2004 and won best feature film at the 2004 Philadelphia Film Festival. However, the film ended up being a commercial failure, making less than $400,000 at the box office during its limited theatrical release. Leonard Maltin lists the movie in his book &quot;151 Best Movies You&#x27;ve Never Seen&quot; and he writes &quot;Mario Van Peebles has written, directed, and starred in a number of films over the years but this is his most personal piece of work-and I think his best.&quot;

<text>.pt is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Portugal and is managed by Associação DNS.PT.
It has the following second-level domains:

* .com.pt: no restrictions; online registration
* .edu.pt: education
* .gov.pt: Government of Portugal
* .int.pt: international organizations or diplomatic missions in Portugal
* .net.pt: telecommunications providers
* .nome.pt: individuals (&quot;nome&quot; is Portuguese for name)
* .org.pt: Non-profit organizations
* .publ.pt: publications (e.g. newspapers)

As from the 1 May 2012 Registration directly at second-level is available, without restrictions. On the first week there was a 28984 new domains register under the .pt. 

Since July 1, 2005, some characters with diacritics have been supported in domain names (IDN). Currently permitted characters: &quot;à&quot;, &quot;á&quot;, &quot;â&quot;, &quot;ã&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ô&quot;, &quot;õ&quot;, &quot;ú&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;. These are the only accentuated characters used in Portuguese words.

Apart from .gov.pt, Portuguese subdomains were slow to catch on, because many people had already registered under .pt when the new ones became available. Many companies, colleges and people still prefer to use a .pt because these are harder to get and simpler to remember. However, the .com.pt subdomain is being heavily promoted by the registry, and now has numerous registrations and active Web sites. Others such as .nome.pt for individuals are still uncommon.

In the early years, FCCN () tried to keep control of the .pt domain using stringent rules, which were adjusted a number of times. The precedent set by domains which were already registered but which would not be able to be registered under updated rules led to lawyers requesting the registry of any domain based on the principle of equal treatment. When the situation was out of control, FCCN tried to promote subdomains like com.pt. Nevertheless, since the registration directly under .pt was still available, users tended to prefer these.

It is estimated that the .pt suffix comprises a little less than 10% of all the Portuguese-language Internet. It is the third most popular Portuguese-language suffix, after .br and .com, and ahead of .net, .org and .info, all above 10 million pages.

<text>.pw is the country code top-level domain for the Republic of Palau. 

==History==
The country code top-level domain .pw was delegated to the Pacific island nation of Palau in 1997. It has since been redelegated a number of times. Directi, a group of technology businesses, obtained exclusive rights over .pw from EnCirca in 2004. From 25 March 2013, domains under the .pw TLD are available to the general public. Since then, it is sometimes marketed as a domain for professionals (professional web).

In July 2013 the registry announced that they had passed the 250,000 registration milestone within the first three months, after having 50,000 registered domains in the first three weeks.

== Issues ==
A few months after opening the registry to the general public, .pw became the target of spammers. 
Symantec released two reports in April and May 2013 claiming that domains under .pw TLD were a significant source of spam e-mail. Directi responded that it had zero tolerance for spam and would be deleting domains accused of violating its anti-abuse policy.

In 2016, the Anti-Phishing Working Group stated that the .cc, .com, .pw, and .tk domain names account for 75% of all malicious domain registrations.

<doc id="1238087" wikidata="Q1338918" url="?curid=1238087" title="Mike Marsh (footballer)">
<text>Michael Andrew Marsh (born 21 July 1969) is an English football coach and former professional player who is currently an assistant manager at Turkish club Beşiktaş.

Marsh came through the ranks at Liverpool and was part of their 1992 FA Cup-winning side. He notably played in the Premier League for The Reds as well as West Ham United and Coventry City before a spell in Turkey with Galatasaray. He went on to play in the Football League with Southend United and then in Non-League with Southport, Barrow, Kidderminster Harriers, Boston United and Accrington Stanley.

Marsh moved into management and had spells in charge of Burscough, Bradford Park Avenue and Northwich Victoria. He was a first-team coach at Liverpool between 2011 and 2015, working under Kenny Dalglish and Brendan Rodgers, before joining Huddersfield Town as a coach in November 2015. He left in May 2016 to take up a coaching role with the England under-17s, and was an assistant coach at Swansea City between 2019 and 2021.

==Playing career==
===Liverpool===
A midfielder or full-back, he was spotted playing for his local side Kirkby Town by Liverpool reserve team coach Phil Thompson, who advised manager Kenny Dalglish to sign the talented youngster, which he did on 21 August 1987. Marsh made his Liverpool debut on 1 March 1989 in the 2–0 win over Charlton Athletic at Anfield, when he came on as a 58th-minute substitute for Jan Mølby.

Marsh graduated from the reserves and established himself as a first-team regular in the 1991–92 season. His first goal also came during this season, in one of the most memorable matches ever played at Anfield, on 6 November 1991 in a UEFA Cup second round second leg tie against Auxerre. The game saw Liverpool turn a 2–0 deficit from the first leg in France into a 3–2 aggregate win. Marsh&#x27;s 29th-minute equaliser swung the game in Liverpool&#x27;s favour.

Marsh was an unused substitute in the 1992 FA Cup Final and picked up a winners medal as Liverpool beat Sunderland 2–0. He continued to be a regular squad member in 1992–93 and began the 1993–94 season in style with a great curled goal in a 5–0 win at Swindon Town, but Graeme Souness allowed him to leave within days of that goal when he joined West Ham United as a makeweight (along with David Burrows) in the deal that took Julian Dicks to Anfield. Marsh had appeared 101 times for Liverpool and scored six goals.

===West Ham United===
Marsh signed for West Ham United on 17 September 1993 and made his debut the following day in the 2–0 win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Marsh&#x27;s time at Upton Park was short-lived. He spent fifteen months at the club, during which he made 61 appearances, scoring twice.

===Coventry City===
Coventry City signed Marsh for £450,000 on 30 December 1994 but he was soon on the move again after nineteen games and two goals in six months at Highfield Road.

===Galatasaray===
It was the manager who had allowed him to leave Liverpool, Graeme Souness, who wanted Marsh&#x27;s signature. He got it for £500,000 on 26 June 1995, taking Marsh to Turkish side Galatasaray. Marsh played three times in two and a half months for the team from Istanbul before he was on the move yet again to Southend United, whose newly installed manager was Marsh&#x27;s ex-Liverpool teammate Ronnie Whelan.

===Southend United===
Marsh signed for the Shrimpers on 3 September 1995 for £500,000. Marsh made his debut on 9 September 1995 in the 1–0 defeat to Sunderland at Roker Park. Marsh had two good seasons at the Essex club, appearing in seventy-five league games and scoring ten times. The second of these seasons saw Southend relegated to the Second Division, the third tier of English football. Things got worse for Marsh as he picked up a knee injury which ultimately and prematurely ended his professional career. He had played ninety seven times for Southend, scoring thirteen goals.

===Barrow and Kidderminster Harriers===
As part of the insurance payout Marsh received when he retired, he was required to never play league football again, so he spent the remainder of his playing career in non-league. The first non-league side he signed for was Barrow, where he stayed for six months before moving to the ambitious Midlands club Kidderminster Harriers on 19 November 1999. Kidderminster were managed by former Liverpool teammate, and the man Marsh had replaced when making his debut, Jan Mølby.

The Harriers were in the Conference looking to gain league status for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. They achieved their dream by the end of Marsh&#x27;s first season for the club, but due to the terms of the insurance claim, Marsh could not follow Mølby and his teammates into league football and had to leave after 24 league appearances, in which he hit the net four times.

===Southport===
Marsh joined Conference side Southport on a free transfer on 18 May 2000 and spent just over a year there, playing 37 times and scoring seven times.

===Boston United===
On 9 June 2001, Marsh joined another ambitious Conference outfit, this time Boston United, who paid Southport £15,000. Marsh&#x27;s experience helped guide Boston to the Conference title, but once again he had to leave as he was not allowed to join his Boston teammates in league football. He played seven times for Boston, scoring once against Chester, but was a major influence within the Boston camp.

===Accrington Stanley===
Marsh&#x27;s last move was to another ambitious club, Accrington Stanley. Accrington won the Northern Premier League that season, thus gaining promotion to the Conference. Marsh ended his career after one season at the Crown Ground on 2 June 2003.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from playing, Marsh was on the coaching staff of Southport. In 2008, Northwich Victoria appointed him as their first-team coach. He quit Northwich to become assistant manager at Bradford Park Avenue in November 2008. Later that month, he was appointed caretaker manager of Park Avenue after Dave Cameron resigned following a defeat against bottom-placed Witton Albion, he shared the role with goalkeeping coach Gary Stokes because he had commitments in Spain.

Marsh was the head academy coach of Accrington &amp; Rossendale College in East Lancashire. Marsh combined this role with his academy coaching job at Liverpool&#x27;s under-16&#x27;s and with his Master&#x27;s football commitments. In May 2011, Liverpool announced that he was to move up to coaching the under-18 side. Marsh moved up to first-team coach at Liverpool before his departure from the club was announced in June 2015.

On 9 November 2015, Marsh joined Huddersfield Town as a coach under new manager David Wagner.

In March 2016, it was announced that Marsh would leave Huddersfield to take up a similar position with the England under-17&#x27;s.

On 13 June 2019, Marsh was named assistant first-team coach to Steve Cooper at Swansea City.

In December 2021, he returned to his North West roots to become the new first team coach to Ryan Lowe at Preston North End.
Following Lowe&#x27;s departure, in August 2024, Marsh was placed on interim charge of Preston.
After a 3–0 away defeat by Swansea City on 17 August, Marsh announced that he did not wish to be considered for the post of manager on a full-time basis and left the club with immediate effect.

<doc id="1238093" wikidata="Q5083718" url="?curid=1238093" title="Charles Wordsworth">
<text>Charles Wordsworth (22 August 1806 – 5 December 1892) was Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane in Scotland. He was a classical scholar, and taught at public schools in England and Scotland. He was a rower, cricketer, and athlete and he instigated both the University cricket match in 1826 and the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in 1829.

==Early life and education==
Wordsworth was born in Lambeth, the son of the Rev. Christopher Wordsworth and a nephew of the poet William Wordsworth. His father was a divine and scholar. He was educated at Harrow where his friends included Charles Merivale and Richard Chenevix Trench. He was in the Harrow cricket eleven for the first regular matches with Eton (1822) and Winchester (1825), He then went to Christ Church, Oxford where he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Latin verse at Oxford in 1827, and the Latin essay in 1831, and took a first-class in classics. Through his continued contact with Merivale at Cambridge University, he is credited with bringing about the first Oxford and Cambridge match in 1827, in which he captained Oxford and took seven wickets. Again with Merivale and his Cambridge contacts he instigated the first university boat race in 1829. He played cricket in the Varsity match in 1829 and rowed in the winning Oxford crew in the Boat Race. In 1869 Wordsworth responded to John Morgan, who was investigating the health effects of rowing.

The subject upon which you have written to me is one in which I naturally take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John&#x27;s, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822–1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.

:(The University cricket match took place on 5 and 6 June and the Boat Race on 10 June.)

==Teaching career==
From 1830 to 1833 Wordsworth was teaching and had as pupils a number of men, including William Gladstone and Cardinal Manning. He then travelled abroad during 1833–1834, and after a year as tutor at Christ Church (1834–1835) was appointed second master at Winchester College. He had previously taken holy orders, though he only became priest in 1840, and he had a strong religious influence with the boys.

In 1839 he brought out his &quot;Greek Grammar&quot;, which had a great success. In 1846, however, he resigned; and then accepted the wardenship of Trinity College, Glenalmond, the new Scottish Episcopal public school and divinity college, where he remained from 1847 to 1854, having great educational success in all respects; though his views on Scottish Church questions brought him into opposition at some important points to Gladstone.

==Ecclesiastical career==
In 1852 Wordsworth was elected Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane, and was consecrated in Aberdeen early next year. He was a strong supporter of the establishment, but conciliatory towards the Free churches, and this brought him into a good deal of controversy. He was a voluminous writer, and was one of the company of revisers of the New Testament (1870–1881), among whom he displayed a conservative tendency.

In 1864 his book &quot;On Shakspeare&#x27;s Knowledge and Use of the Bible&quot; was published in London.

In continuing his letter to Morgan, Wordsworth described his activities in 1869.

For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my constitution is not seriously impaired, as you may conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew as a young man at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.

==Later life==
Wordsworth died in St Andrews and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery against the north wall (which backs onto the cathedral grounds).

==Family==
Wordsworth was twice married, first in 1835 to Charlotte Day (d. 1839), and secondly in 1846 to Katherine Mary Barter (d. 1897). He had thirteen children altogether. He was the older brother of Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln.

See his &quot;Annals of my Early Life&quot; (1891), and &quot;Annals of My Life&quot;, edited by W Earl Hodgson (1893); also &quot;The Episcopate of Charles Wordsworth&quot;, by his nephew John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury (1899).

He is best known for his collaborations with actor and comedian Jim Carrey and director Tom Shadyac (particularly the &quot;Ace Ventura&quot; franchise), his series of &quot;Thumbmation&quot; shorts and his film &quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot; (2002), along with his films &quot;Santa vs. the Snowman 3D&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, and &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; remake. His film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius was nominated for an Academy Award. 

== Early life ==
Oedekerk was born in Seattle, Washington; he was raised by his mother Rena Borlandeli and father Martin Oedekerk in Huntington Beach, California. He attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California and Golden West College in Huntington Beach. He is of Dutch Frisian, Irish, Hungarian and Italian (Lombard) descent. His mother is an immigrant from Magnago, Italy. His paternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in South Africa to Dutch parents.

== Career ==
Throughout his career, Oedekerk has appeared in and created several television specials for NBC, ABC, and UPN. He also contributed his writing talents to FOX during the late 1980s and through the early 1990s. It was during this time that Oedekerk befriended fellow comic/actor Jim Carrey while working on the television series &quot;In Living Color&quot; during its 1990–1994 run; this was the first of numerous collaborations between the two.

Prior to his successful contributions to several unknown episodes in the &quot;Color&quot; TV series, he wrote and starred in his first independent/directorial film, &quot;Smart Alex&quot; (1987). It wasn&#x27;t until 1991 that Oedekerk was attached not only as a writer, but also as the protagonist, as Thane Furrows in the film &quot;High Strung&quot;. Jim Carrey also starred opposite him in the role of Death, although he went uncredited. They eventually developed a strong friendship, which still exists today. Shortly afterward, Oedekerk again worked alongside Carrey as the project consultant for Tom Shadyac&#x27;s first film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994). The film became a break-out success and he was given the opportunity to both direct and write its sequel, &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; (1995). This time Oedekerk directed and wrote the movie after Shadyac left before filming. The sequel proved to be more successful, surpassing the box office gross of the original. Despite this, both Oedekerk and Carrey wanted to pursue other projects, but still remained friends.

Following the &quot;Ace Ventura&quot; franchise, Oedekerk co-wrote &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1996), which was also directed by Shadyac for Universal Pictures; it became one of the highest-grossing films of that year. He soon wrote, directed and also had a cameo appearance in &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; (1997), starring Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence. Oedekerk took a hiatus from directing major film productions for the rest of the 1990s, but continued to write screenplays, including &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot; (2000), &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (2001), &quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot; (2002) (which he directed, wrote and starred in), &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003) and &quot;Barnyard&quot; (2006) (which he directed, wrote, produced, and voiced various characters). In 2003, he signed a first look deal with Universal.

In 2007, Oedekerk produced the screenplay and story for the &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; sequel, &quot;Evan Almighty;&quot; again, Shadyac directed both films. He has also been commissioned to write the screenplay for the &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; film adaptation; Jim Carrey has since been cast in the title role. No news involving the project has been reported since.

In February 2009, Universal Pictures announced that Steve Oedekerk would be penning a film adaptation of the Stretch Armstrong superhero doll. As of 2016, the film is left in development hell with an animated series currently in the works.

In 2015, it was announced that a sequel to &quot;Kung Pow&quot; is currently in the works with him returning to write and direct.

== O Entertainment ==
O Entertainment was a production company founded by Steve Oedekerk in 1990. O Entertainment&#x27;s productions include the Thumbmation series (&quot;Thumb Wars&quot;, &quot;Bat Thumb&quot;, &quot;Thumbtanic&quot;, etc.), &quot;Santa vs. the Snowman 3D&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;, and the movie &quot;The Super Mouse&quot;. The animation division, Omation Animation Studio, was founded by Oedekerk himself and hired animators who previously worked in DNA Productions after the studio closed down in 2006.

In 1990, Oedekerk founded an entertainment company, O Entertainment. In 1997, he created and starred in a variety special, featuring computer animation, entitled &quot;The O Show&quot; (also known as &quot;steve.oedekerk.com&quot;). He is also executive producer of the animated series &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; on Nickelodeon.

== Omation Animation Studio ==
Oedekerk founded Omation Animation Studio (commonly known as Omation) in 2002 as a division of O Entertainment. Their first animation project was the feature film &quot;Barnyard&quot; (which Oedekerk wrote, directed, produced, and performed as a voice actor). Around 2006–2007, the studio began production on a Nicktoon based on the film titled &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;. The series premiered on Nickelodeon on September 29, 2007. A second season followed, and six additional episodes airing on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister channel Nicktoons from September 12, 2011, until November 12, 2011. Following the closure of DNA Productions in 2006, many of the employees there moved to Omation.

Oedekerk also gained popularity with his series of &quot;Thumbmation&quot; shorts: &quot;Thumb Wars&quot;, &quot;Bat Thumb&quot;, &quot;The Godthumb&quot;, &quot;Frankenthumb&quot;, &quot;The Blair Thumb&quot; and &quot;Thumbtanic&quot;.

Following the failure of &quot;Planet Sheen&quot; and its subsequent cancellation in 2013, the studio was shut down along with O Entertainment.

<doc id="1238102" wikidata="Q798734" url="?curid=1238102" title="Bad Lieutenant">
<text>Bad Lieutenant is a 1992 American neo-noir crime film directed by Abel Ferrara. The film stars Harvey Keitel as the title character &quot;bad lieutenant&quot; as well as Victor Argo and Paul Calderón. The screenplay was co-written by Ferrara with actress-model Zoë Lund, both of whom appear in the film in minor roles. The film was screened in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

Since its release, &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; has become one of Ferrara&#x27;s best known and most critically appreciated works.

==Plot==
After dropping off his two young sons at Catholic school, an unnamed NYPD police lieutenant snorts cocaine before driving to the scene of a double homicide in Union Square. The lieutenant then tracks down a drug dealer and gives him a bag of cocaine from a crime scene; he has a small bag of crack cocaine fronted and smokes some while the dealer promises to give him the money he makes from selling the drugs in a few days. The lieutenant ends the day at a rundown apartment, where he gets drunk and engages in a threesome with two women. He then visits a red-haired female junkie and smokes heroin with her. In parallel events, a nun is raped inside a church by two young hoodlums.

The next morning, the lieutenant learns that he has lost a bet on a National League Championship Series baseball game between the New York Mets and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He tries to win back his money by doubling his wager on the Dodgers in the next game. At another crime scene, the lieutenant rifles through the victim&#x27;s car and finds a hidden stash, which he stuffs in his coat pocket. However, the bag falls out onto the street in front of his colleagues. The lieutenant lies and says that he intended to enter the drugs into evidence, and orders them to do it on his behalf.

At a hospital, the lieutenant spies on the nun&#x27;s examination and learns that she was penetrated with a crucifix. Later that evening, he pulls over two teenage girls who are using their father&#x27;s car without his knowledge to go to a club. Aware that they are unlicensed, the lieutenant extorts the girls by having one of them bend over and pull up her skirt and the other to simulate oral sex while he masturbates. The following day, he eavesdrops on the nun&#x27;s confession to her superior, where she says she knows who assaulted her but will not identify them.

While drinking and shooting drugs as he drives through Times Square, the lieutenant listens to the final moments of the Dodgers game and shoots out his car stereo in a drug-fueled rage when the Mets win. Despite being unable to pay the $30,000 wager, he doubles his bet for the next game. The lieutenant spends the last of his money on more drinks when the Dodgers lose again. After scoring cocaine in a nightclub, he tries to double his bet again but the runner refuses, insisting that his bookie would kill him.

The lieutenant picks up his $30,000 share from the drug dealer and calls the bookie personally to place his bet. They arrange to meet in front of Madison Square Garden. He then visits the red-haired junkie again for a final shot of heroin. At the church, he tells the nun that he will exact vengeance upon her attackers, but she repeats that she has forgiven them and leaves. In the resulting emotional breakdown, the lieutenant sees an apparition of Jesus and tearfully curses him before begging forgiveness for his crimes and sins. The figure is revealed to be a woman holding a golden chalice, which turns out to have been pawned at her husband&#x27;s shop.

With the help of the woman, the lieutenant tracks the two rapists to a nearby crack den in Spanish Harlem and cuffs them together. The three men then smoke crack while listening to the Mets win the pennant on a radio. Instead of taking them to the station, he drives them to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and puts them on a bus with a cigar box containing the $30,000 and a promise not to return. After he leaves the terminal, he parks on the street in front of Penn Station. Another car drives up beside him, and the driver, presumably the bookie with whom the lieutenant had arranged to meet, fatally shoots the lieutenant before speeding off. A crowd begins to form as the police arrive.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to Zoë Lund:
There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech – which is crucial to the Lieutenant – was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go.

Lund avowed in an interview that she &quot;co-directed&quot; several scenes in the film. Lund also claimed that she wrote the screenplay of &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; alone and believed that Ferrara did not put much effort in his contributions in the film.

According to Jonas Mekas, Lund&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Edouard de Laurot was reported to have written most of the film&#x27;s script. David Scott Milton later vouched for this claim. Mekas even claimed he had &quot;scribbles and notes to prove it&quot;.

Ferrara said in 2012 that he was using drugs during the making of the film: The director of that film needed to be using, the director and the writer—not the actors.

The Special Edition DVD from Lion&#x27;s Gate has a special feature about the pre-, during, and post-production of the film, in which Ferrara explains the screenplay&#x27;s genesis, its authorship, and its original brevity.

Christopher Walken was originally going to portray the titular character, having previously worked with Ferrera on &quot;King of New York&quot;.

==Alternate versions==
Originally rated NC-17 and one of the few films to be rated thus on the basis of depictions of drug use and violence (the only other film being &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;), the unedited cut&#x27;s rating was described as being for &quot;sexual violence, strong sexual situations and dialogue, graphic drug use&quot;.

Blockbuster and Hollywood Video, the largest video rental companies in the United States, had a policy prohibiting the purchase and rental of NC-17 films. An R-rated cut was created specifically so that Blockbuster and the other retailers would rent and purchase out the film. The R-rated cut was described with &quot;drug use, language, violence, and nudity&quot;. The scene in which the Lieutenant pulls over two young girls and masturbates in front of them is almost completely absent from the Blockbuster version.

The original theatrical version featured the song &quot;Signifying Rapper&quot; by Schoolly D. The song was removed from some editions of the film&#x27;s home video release due to the unauthorized use of a re-recorded guitar riff from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot;, which the rapper did not license.

===Ban in Ireland===
On January 29, 1993, the film was banned in Ireland. Sheamus Smith, who headed the Irish Film Censor Board at the time, felt the film had a &quot;demeaning treatment of women&quot;. The DVD release was banned for the same reason 10 years later.

==Reception==
&quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; has a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; will challenge less desensitized viewers with its depiction of police corruption, but Harvey Keitel&#x27;s committed performance makes it hard to turn away.&quot; Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised Ferrara&#x27;s talent for making &quot;gleefully down-and-dirty films&quot;, continuing, &quot;He has come up with his own brand of supersleaze, in a film that would seem outrageously, unforgivably lurid if it were not also somehow perfectly sincere.&quot; Desson Howe for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the Lieutenant &quot;a notch nicer than Satan&quot;, and he cites Keitel&#x27;s work as the film&#x27;s saving grace, &quot;It is only the strength of Keitel&#x27;s performance that gives his personality human dimension.&quot;

Mark Kermode has mentioned that the film was praised as &quot;a powerful tale of redemptive Catholicism&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and stated that &quot;in the Bad Lieutenant, Keitel has given us one of the great screen performances in recent years&quot;. Martin Scorsese named this movie as the fifth best movie of the 1990s.

==Followup==
A narratively unrelated follow-up, &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot;, was released in 2009, seventeen years after the first film&#x27;s release. The film was directed by Werner Herzog and stars Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes. It was described as being &quot;neither a sequel nor a remake&quot;. Both films were produced by Edward R. Pressman.

<text>.sd is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Sudan.

== History ==
The .sd country code top-level domain (ccTLD) was delegated to Sudan in 1997. Initially, it was managed by the Sudan Internet Society (SIS), which played a key role in establishing the domain&#x27;s infrastructure. On December 20, 2002, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) formally redelegated the management of .sd to the Sudanese National Telecommunications Corporation (NTC). This change reflected the evolving governance and administrative structure within Sudan&#x27;s internet ecosystem as the government sought more centralized oversight of internet resources.

In 2018, the Internet Society collaborated with stakeholders in Sudan to organize a DNSSEC deployathon in Khartoum. This event aimed to enhance the security and resilience of the .sd domain by promoting the adoption of Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). The deployathon marked a significant step in Sudan&#x27;s efforts to modernize its internet infrastructure and align with global best practices.

<doc id="1238113" wikidata="Q1654852" url="?curid=1238113" title="Jiu Valley">
<text>The Jiu Valley ( , ) is a region in southwestern Transylvania, Romania, in Hunedoara county, situated in a valley of the Jiu River between the Retezat Mountains and the Parâng Mountains. The region was heavily industrialised and the main activity was coal mining, but due to low efficiency, most of the mines were closed down in the years following the collapse of Communism in Romania. For a long time the place was called Romania&#x27;s biggest coalfield.

==History==
===Before the 19th century===
The region was populated since ancient times, being part of Dacia. During the Middle Ages, the inhabitants of the Jiu Valley lived in huts spread along the mountains, and often near the river, and the main activity was shepherding. Until the early 19th century the region remained sparsely populated due to its geographical isolation (being surrounded by mountains).

===19th century and early 20th century===

The development of coal mining started in the Jiu Valley about 160 years ago, around the middle of the 19th century, when Hungarian, German, Czech and Polish workers were brought from all parts of the Habsburg Empire to work in the coal mines. Romanian miners from other regions, such as Baia Mare or the Apuseni Mountains, were also brought to work in the Jiu Valley. During the late 19th century, the region started to strongly develop itself, economically and culturally, through a flourishing industry based on mining. The Jiu Valley, being situated in Transylvania, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the 1918 Union of Transylvania with Romania. During World War I, the area was the site of heavy fighting between Romanian forces on one side and German and Austro-Hungarian forces on the other side. The first battle ended in an important, albeit temporary defensive victory for the Romanians, nevertheless the Central Powers succeeded to break through the Romanian defences here in November 1916. Mining continued to dominate the economy in the 20th century, but the region also experienced social unrest, notably the Lupeni Strike of 1929. The mines were privately owned until 1948, when all private companies were nationalized by the Communist government.

===The Jiu Valley during the Communist regime===
As part of Romania&#x27;s reparations to the Soviet Union for its wartime alliance with Germany, the Romanian coal mines were nationalized and converted into joint Soviet-Romanian companies (SovRoms). These Sovroms continued for about ten years. The Jiu Valley expanded rapidly in the second half of the 20th century as the country&#x27;s communist rulers (Petru Groza 1945–1952, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej 1952–1965, and Nicolae Ceaușescu 1965–1989) embarked on an intensive industrial growth program fueled by coal combustion. Steel production rose from 280,000 tons in 1938 to 13,790,000 tons in 1985. Steel production was fueled by coke, distilled carbon made from metallurgical coal. As coke was generated, it gave off coal tar as a by-product that was then used in manufacturing many other products. To meet the labor requirement for this demand, the communist government imported tens of thousands of miners from around the country, mainly from Moldavia. By 1979 the number of miners reached 179,000.

During the 1970s and 1980s Ceaușescu determined that Romania should be completely debt-free and sought to repay its foreign debt ahead of the repayment schedule agreed to by the country&#x27;s creditors. To accomplish this, he exported for sale any products or materials of value, while the little inferior food and products remained was sold on the domestic market. Opposition was ruthlessly crushed and expressions of discontent were stifled by the ubiquitous Securitate, the secret police. As a result, in order to survive, more and more people began to transact business through barter trade and other informal economic means. achieved his goal, but at a huge cost to nearly all sectors of the country. Since the anti-Ceaușescu revolution in 1989, restructuring of the coal sector, the country&#x27;s economic contraction, and a shift toward natural gas all contributed to a significant decrease in both production and consumption of coal in Romania. Production declined by 57%, from 66.4 million short tons (Mmst) in 1989 to 28.6 Mmst in 1998. Consumption also fell more than 60%, from 77.7 Mmst in 1989 to 30.8 Mmst in 1998.

During this same period the Jiu Valley has been profoundly influenced by lack of re-investment, deteriorating infrastructure, mine closures and massive layoffs, environmental degradation, and political and cultural isolation from the rest of Romania.

===Organized labor in Romania===
Organized labor has played an important role in post-revolution Romania, affecting the actions of every government since 1989. Chronic work stoppages and economic disruptions by various labor organizations helped bring down successive governments and contributed to general economic and political instability. While trade unions have existed in Romania since the late nineteenth century, during the communist period from World War II until 1989 independent trade unions were not allowed to exist. Instead, there was a national pyramid of industry federations consisting of enterprise trade unions and headed by the General Union of Romanian Trade Unions. The few attempts during this period to found independent trade unions or organize worker protests were ruthlessly suppressed, with their leaders severely punished or executed. Following the chaos of December 1989, trade organizations sprang up virtually overnight. Unlike in Western Europe where trade-union pluralism typically reflects ideological groupings, in Romania labor movement fragmentation reflected distrust of higher authority, personal ambition and unwillingness of leaders to reduce or share power. As of 1997, labor analysts estimated that there were over 14,000 enterprise trade union organizations, 150 federations, and 18 confederations, representing approximately two-thirds of the workforce. Some consolidation occurred in the 1990s.

===Jiu Valley Coal Miners Union===
Few, if any, Romanian trade unions, though, have had as much influence or won as much national notoriety (or international attention) as the &quot;Liga Sindicatelor Miniere din Valea Jiului&quot; (League of Miners Unions of the Jiu Valley, or Jiu Valley Coal Miners Union). While there are two other coal mining regions (primarily surface mining) in Romania, and other miners unions, the Jiu Valley Coal Miners Union has long been the most independent and militant.

Political and social unrest in this region is nothing new. To this day miners commemorate the Lupeni Strike of 1929 (when the army killed 23 workers and wounded at least 53), the big strikes of February 1933, and the miners’ protest in 1977 during the Ceaușescu years. On the latter occasion, on 1 August 1977, 35,000 Jiu miners gathered in the main yard of the Lupeni mine to protest against a new decree that raised the age of retirement from 50 to 55 and reduced the miners’ pensions. Spokesmen for the miners claimed that the protest was the culmination of many years of deteriorating conditions and the intolerable political situation in the country. Ceaușescu dealt with the miners by agreeing to their demands and then, as soon as the movement subsided, ordered reprisals against the leaders. He also transferred four thousand of them out of the area and replaced them, many of the replacements working as informants for the Securitate, the dreaded secret police. The subsequent climate of fear kept the miners silent until the 1989 revolution.

===The 1990s: the rise and decline of miners&#x27; unions===
During the 1990s the Jiu Valley miners have played a visible role in Romanian politics. In fact, Romanians have a name – &quot;mineriada (mineriad)&quot; – for the periodic eruptions of violence when Jiu Valley miners went on strike and descended upon Bucharest. The first post-revolution action came in 1990. In May 1990, former communist official Ion Iliescu won the presidential election with a majority of over 80% (President from 1990–1996, re-elected December 2000). Some groups, dissatisfied with results, continued street demonstrations in Bucharest, after most of the participants in the electoral meetings before the election had renounced the sit in. Several weeks after the elections, when the authorities attempted to evict the remaining protesters occupying one of Bucharest&#x27;s central square, violence erupted and, as the police and gendarmerie retreated under pressure, protesters attacked several state institutions, including the police headquarters, the national television station, and the Foreign Ministry.

When the police failed to contain the crowds in University Square, President Iliescu issued a call to arms to Romania&#x27;s population to prevent further attacks on the newly elected authorities. Among those who responded to the call from organizers were coal miners from the Jiu Valley, who accepted the government offered transport to go to Bucharest to confront the demonstrators. An estimated 10,000 miners were transported to the capital in special trains.

State television broadcast videos of workers attacking and fighting with protesters, including students, as well as the opposition party headquarters. The miners claim that the agitation and most of the brutality was the work of Iliescu&#x27;s government agents who had infiltrated and disguised themselves as miners (&quot;see the June 1990 Mineriad&quot;), and there were widespread rumors and suspicion that the Serviciul Român de Informații (the successor to the Securitate) was involved or behind the events with the miners.

Later parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and that the miners had been &quot;joined by vigilantes who were later credibly identified as former officers of the Securitate.&quot; For two days, the miners (aided and abetted by the former Securitate members) violently confronted the protesters and other targets. Despite denials by the secret service, in February 1994 a Bucharest court &quot;found two security officers, Colonel Ion. Nicolae and warrant officer Corneliu Dumitrescu, guilty of ransacking the house of Ion Rațiu, a leading figure in the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, during the miners’ incursion, and stealing $100,000.&quot; Petre Roman&#x27;s government fell in late September 1991, when the miners returned to Bucharest to demand higher salaries. A technocrat, Theodor Stolojan, was appointed to head an interim government until new elections could be held.

The 1990 mineriad was followed by several other actions during Iliescu&#x27;s presidency. In September 1991, the miners, irritated that the government had not lived up to its economic promises, descended on Bucharest again. An estimated 10,000 miners came to the capital. Rioting ensued and lasted over four days. The actions during this time led to the resignation and replacement of the prime minister and his cabinet. August 1993 saw another miner strike and a resumption of general strikes by other trade unions. In November 1996, many miners, fed up with what they saw as a betrayal on the part of Iliescu, voted for his opponent, Emil Constantinescu, during the parliamentary and presidential elections.

The economic situation for state-favored working classes, such as the miners, who had been relatively insulated against the harsh privation suffered by the general populace, changed after 1989. During Ceausescu&#x27;s regime the mines and other ineffective state-owned industries were artificially propped up and protected against market fluctuations. Miners were considered relatively well paid, although there was little of value to purchase with the money they earned. After the revolution in December 1989 the replacement government maintained Ceausescu&#x27;s policy of subsidizing these money-losing industries with few changes to the industrial or management practices that had led to the problems in the first place. The government borrowed heavily without adhering to the conditions of economic reforms required by the World Bank, the IMF and other international lenders. With Ceausescu&#x27;s forced privations lifted, and falling prices for Romanian exports, the country&#x27;s international debt soared. This in turn led to fewer funds allocated to industry reinvestment and maintenance.

Relations between labor and the new Constantinescu government, while appearing initially quite promising, proved as difficult and problematic as before. Under pressure from international lenders (most notably the International Monetary Fund), who refused to provide any more financial assistance unless inefficient and money-losing state owned operations were reduced and other reforms carried out, in February 1997 the new center right coalition embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and radical structural reform program. This program was also seen as a key requirement for attaining the government&#x27;s goal of membership in NATO and the European Union (EU).

The Constantinescu and Vasile (who succeeded Victor Ciorbea as Prime Minister) government&#x27;s urgent priority was to reduce budget and trade deficits by making major budget cuts (particularly in social spending), and eliminating non-profitable sectors, including the mines. Decreased mine yields (in no small part due to lack of operating capital and access to technology) and a low international price of and demand for Romanian coal all contributed toward the huge losses in the mining industry being incurred by the government. By some estimates, national demand for coal fell from 44 million tons in 1996 to 33.5 million in 1997, out of a potential annual capacity of 52 million tons.

===Velvet restructuring and subsequent unrest===

Under the initial Constantinescu first prime minister and cabinet, the government executed what was referred to in the government and media as a “velvet restructuring” of the mining sector under Ordinance 22. In the process of the “velvet restructuring” 18,000 miners lost their jobs, with the rest left with uncertain futures. The government had promised the miners 15 to 20 months of salary as severance (totaling nearly 20-30 million lei, or $1,230-1,846, according to the August 1999 exchange rate) to help them start their own businesses. Many of the miners, noting the growing number of terminations, did not hesitate to put their names on the lay-off list. However, a year after the beginning of the mining sector restructuring, only approximately 5,000 of the 18,000 had employment, either through starting their own jobs or finding other jobs (and most of these with the companies overseeing the mine closures).

Each mine closure is widely felt in the Jiu Valley community. In Campul lui Neag, the westernmost mine in Jiu Valley, after Ordinance 22 only 152 people remained of the 790 who used to work there before 1966. At Dâlja, a mine in the east of the Jiu Valley there were only 1,023 miners left of the former 3,000. In Lupeni, reputed the second largest mine in Europe and, unlike some of the other Jiu Valley mines, a relatively profitable one, by 1999 only 4,000 workers remained of the pre-1996 8,000 workers. Of these 4,000 only an estimated one-third were actual miners, with the remaining two-thirds aboveground jobs such as administrative, engineering, and technical staff.

The government&#x27;s actions, while winning concessions with the international lenders, led to growing antagonism with labor. By August 1997 the growing criticism of labor throughout the country translated into strikes and eventually led to the resignation and replacement of the prime minister and cabinet. In the Jiu Valley government&#x27;s announcement in 1997 of the closures of the Dâlja and Barbateni mines and the generally deteriorating conditions of the miners sparked riots and then led to a general strike.

Despite the probable and most likely reaction of the miners, in order to be eligible for an IMF loan to repay its debts the government was required to close more mines (142 which had been closed since 1997) and was pending decision on closing additional 112 mines. To limit losses in the unprofitable mining sector, then running at $370 million, the government made an announcement just before Christmas 1998 of its plan to close non-profitable mines. After closing about 100 mines and getting rid of 90,000 mining jobs in the course of 1997, including 20,000 in the Jiu Valley, implementing this new plan would result in firing additional 6,500 miners.

The result was an outpouring of miner resentment and anger at what the miners saw as another betrayal. Organized by union leader Miron Cozma, on 20 January 1999 an estimated 10-15,000 set out on another &quot;mineriad&quot; from the Jiu Valley to Bucharest to force the government to change its policy, demand wage increases and re-opening of recently closed mines.

Along the way the caravan of miners fought pitched and bloody, tear-gas choked battles with the Gendarmerie and wreaked havoc along the way. The army was mobilized and waited on the outskirts of Bucharest. The anticipated and dreaded showdown between the miners and army, however, never materialized. The miners had not reached Bucharest when a secret compromise was reached between union leader Cozma and Prime Minister Radu Vasile on 22 January. In return for the miners’ agreement to turn around and go back to the Jiu Valley, the government agreed to a 30 percent pay rise, re-opening of two previously closed mines, and the spending of hundreds of millions of European Union development funds on projects in the Jiu Valley. Some analysts conclude that the agreement may well have averted an eruption by disaffected workers in other industries.

To many the compromise agreement was seen as a Pyrrhic victory for both sides. While the government avoided a showdown with the miners, the compromise represented “a potentially devastating setback to the government’s flagging efforts to push through market-oriented reforms – including the closure of 140 loss-making coalmines, 49 loss-making state enterprises and a five-year plan to restructure the steel industry with the loss of 70,000 jobs.” As for the miners the future was no more certain than it was before the strike.

The agreement made Cozma a hero in the Jiu Valley, but within a month of his return he was arrested and put in prison as a result of a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, an action seen by most miners as political revenge by the government. For his role in the 1991 mineriad Cozma had been convicted and sentenced to prison for three years, of which he had served eighteen months before being released in 1998. After the January mineriad, despite his apparent agreement with the government Cozma continued to press for new concessions and announced another strike. In its decision the Supreme Court increased Cozma&#x27;s sentence to 18 years for “undermining state power” in the 1991 mineriad, along with the charge of illegal possession of a firearm. Cozma defied the government to arrest him and led another march towards Bucharest, but soon thereafter, although protected by a convoy of several thousand miners, Cozma and over 500 miners were arrested in a bloody clash with the police special forces at the Olt River crossing near Stoenești. Several weeks later, already imprisoned, Cozma was convicted on two other unrelated charges.

In December 2000, the electorate, which had seen the country&#x27;s economic and social situation continue to degenerate under the Constantinescu government, overwhelmingly rejected the “centrists”. After the first election round saw a fragmented right lose on all fronts, the electorate came to choose between Iliescu and the extremist Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the runoff, securing Iliescu&#x27;s victory.

===Effects of mine closings===
To mitigate the effects of the mine closures, in 1999 the government announced several measures to assist the economically depressed Jiu Valley. These measures included: 1) designating the Jiu Valley as a disadvantaged area, a status under which companies investing in the area would benefit from certain tax breaks; 2) construction on the Campul lui Neag-Baile Herculane road (begun August 15, 1999); and 3) the National Tourism Authority designating the Jiu Valley as a tourist area in order to provide jobs for some of the laid-off workers. In addition, the World Bank designated $12 million to fund a social mitigation plan. Most miners, however, continue to see no tangible assistance or implementation of job creation or new skills training. As such, government pronouncements are skeptically seen as mere lip service of politicians attempting to placate the electorate and prevent more miner unrest. The money was inadequate, they say, the development and implementation of laws and programs set up too late, and no infrastructure was ever established to support the development of new industries like tourism.

Within the Jiu Valley opinions and rumors abound as to what the future potentially holds. Many miners feel that coal mining in Romania is a moribund industry that will never regain its position of significance. Some still hope that the industry will experience resurgence and point to the example of the Hungarian government, which, after closing their mines under international pressure, was compelled by the powerful reaction of the miners to reopen them.

Miners salaries, estimated at $400–500/month as of January 2006, are considerably higher than the average in Jiu Valley which lag far behind the national average income. Miners who have been laid off by the mines are to receive a severance pay, but often saw this eaten away by the hyperinflation in the late 1990s, only brought under control in the past several years (2006). During the first redundancies, what little income in lei was not spent immediately for basic necessities was typically not deposited in banks (which were seen as unreliable) but was exchanged for U.S. dollars or Deutschmarks and hidden in their homes. By 2000 this had begun to change as the Romanian banks became more efficient and competitive, and as public confidence began to grow, so did deposits.

With the redundancy pay-offs, some of the miners expressed interests in starting their own businesses and see the Jiu Valley develop a tourist industry, but the impediments to both are painfully obvious and everywhere. The original redundancy payments, estimated at a total maximum of 100% of 12 month salaries (paid upfront), plus an additional 50-60% of monthly salary paid over the next 18 months, was hardly enough to buy inventory or start a business, particularly when adding in the cost of dealing with bureaucracy and corruption. Before 2000, if the money was not invested with a high enough return, the high Romanian inflation soon ate the savings away. Furthermore, while many residents looked to the development of tourism as a substitute industry, this possibility seemed limited by the lack of a service economy infrastructure, with such basics as adequate accommodation, roads, transport, equipment rentals, tourist information, programs, medical facilities, banks, and other basic business services.

==Description==

Geographically, the area is located in the south of the region of Transylvania, along the Jiu river basin, and it is surrounded by mountains. The Jiu Valley is Romania&#x27;s principal coal mining region. Two other areas in Romania have some surface mining, while the Jiu Valley contains deep shaft underground mines. While providing only 12% of the Romania&#x27;s supply of coal, the Jiu Valley is the only region in Romania both completely urbanized and with a history of being largely reliant on a single industry. Coal mining has long been the heart and economic lifeline for the Jiu Valley, but this activity has decreased since the 1990s, when many mines were closed. Currently, the Jiu Valley is one of the poorest areas in Romania.

==Cities and towns==


There are several settlements in the area, the largest of which is the city of Petroșani, which was founded in the 17th century, and which is an important cultural centre of the region. Lupeni is a mining town which has played a major role historically in the area, as it was the site of the Lupeni Strike of 1929 and of the Jiu Valley miners&#x27; strike of 1977.

==Current situation==
By 2011, the population of the Jiu Valley was 119,484 inhabitants, largely concentrated in the region&#x27;s six small towns – Petroşani, Lupeni, Vulcan, Uricani, Petrila, and Aninoasa, but also including small villages such as Câmpu lui Neag, Lonea and Bănița. In the late 1990s most of the workforce still depended upon the mines for work and income, and by 2010 this number was still high, although the economic demographics of the region had undergone significant changes in recent years, particularly with the admittance of Romania into the European Union in 2007.

The region has experienced severe economic decline due to mines being closed and high unemployment, and the town of Aninoasa was called &quot;the Detroit of Europe&quot;. Nevertheless, the Jiu Valley region was unevenly affected; for instance Petroşani, being the largest town of the region has long had a more diverse economy; while Straja has developed itself based on tourism as a mountain resort.

===Active and closed mines===
In 1990 there were 15 active mines in the Jiu Valley. In 2013, there were seven active mines; in 2015 the mine of Petrila was closed, and at the end of 2017, the mines of Uricani and Paroșeni were closed.
Two other mines (Lonea and Lupeni) were set to be closed in 2018, but for the time being the activity will continue because their closing is not yet safe. As such, there are currently four active mines: Vulcan, Livezeni, Lonea and Lupeni. The government has announced plans to end mining in Jiu Valley by 2031. The mine from Lonea is to be closed by the end of 2025, the mine from Lupeni by June 2026, and the mines from Vulcan and Livezeni are to be closed by 2030.

The Jiu Valley mines were managed by the National Hard Coal Company (Romanian: Compania Naționala a Huilei) a commercial society set up by the Government of Romania in 1998. The company&#x27;s main headquarters was located in Petroșani. The mines are scattered throughout the Jiu Valley. The locations of the active mines still active in 2006 were as follows: the Petrila Mine in the town of Petrila, the Lonea Mine at the village of Lonea, the Livezeni Mine at the city of Petroșani, the Paroşeni and Vulcan Mines at the town of Vulcan, the Aninoasa Mine located in the town of Aninoasa, and the Lupeni Mine and Bărbăţeni Mine in the city of Lupeni. Among the mines closed since 1989, the locations were as follows: Dâlja Mine (Petroșani), Iscroni Mine (Aninoasa), Lonea-Pilier Mine (Lonea), Petrila-Sud Mine (Petrila), Câmpul lui Neag Mine (Câmpul lui Neag), and the Uricani and Valea de Brazi Mines located near the town of Uricani.

===Mining workforce and unemployment===
Through mine closures, forced layoffs and voluntary severance, the number of actual miners in the Jiu Valley has decreased considerably. The mine closures were accompanied by large numbers of lay-offs of miners. It is estimated that in 1989 there were some 40,000-50,000 mine workers (including both actual underground miners and auxiliary workers). The number of mine workers in the Jiu Valley in 2000 was estimated to be between 18,000-20,000, this number decreasing by some sixty percent during the previous ten-year period. Approximately 25% of these total mine workers worked above ground. By 2012, only about 8,000 mine workers worked in the Jiu Valley, and by 2022 the number fell to less than 3,000.

Although there were also few jobs elsewhere in Romania, by 2000 unemployment was rampant in the Jiu Valley. Although many felt that this number was much higher, in 1999 the National Agency for the Development and Application of Reconstruction Programs in the Mining Regions (ANDIPRZM) estimated that over 16,000, or 25% of the working population, are unemployed, compared with the official statistics of the national average of 10%. While official estimates were lower, the former mayor of Lupeni (a city of then approximately 35,000 and the location of the largest mine in Romania) estimated that real unemployment in the city was nearly sixty percent in the year 2000.

===Environmental pollution===
The Jiu Valley suffers from significant pollution due to industrialization and geographical factors (being situated in a depression). The region has been for more than a century a strongly mono-industrial one, with the economy revolving around mining, and this has had a very negative impact upon the environment. After the collapse of the mining industry in the 1990s, the region was officially considered a disadvantaged area, but there were not sufficient resources to care for the environment. The main effects of pollution are the pollution of the underground waters which also affects the surface, and the air pollution. This negatively affects the health of the population. The climate of Jiu Valley is also unfavourable: the mountain protection hamper the refreshing of the air. Another effect is the pollution of Jiu river.

===Social problems===
Many of the social problems of Jiu Valley are common to other parts of Romania (such as poverty and unemployment), but these problems are affecting the region in an exacerbated way, due to factors such as the extreme mono-industrialization during the 20th century, the geographical isolation of the region, and the low level of education of the population. Increasingly this region is relying on the informal economy/black market in order to survive. Almost all activities in the area used to rely directly or indirectly on the mines, so when the mines were closed an economic and social shock occurred. There are very few opportunities outside mining due to the fact that the region is not an agricultural one (which would have offered a safety net in the form of subsistence agriculture). Much of the population is also uprooted and isolated, due to the fact that many of the workers were forcefully brought from other parts of the country during the communist regime. During the 1970s and 1980s, workers from pauper, rural counties from all over the country were brought in the Jiu Valley, which led to a heterogeneous population that made social networking difficult.

<doc id="1238120" wikidata="Q4432978" url="?curid=1238120" title="Unusual notrump">
<text>In the card game of bridge, the unusual notrump is a conventional showing a two-suited hand. It was originally devised by Al Roth in 1948 with Tobias Stone, to show the minor suits after the opponents opened in a major.

The convention concept is now generally extended to show the &quot;two lowest unbid&quot; suits. Thus, over 1, 2NT shows diamonds and hearts; and over 1, it shows clubs and hearts. In addition to succinctly describing the hand to the partner, it deprives the opponents of bidding space, i.e. it has a preemptive effect. A drawback is that it provides the opponents with information about the strength and distribution of the overcaller&#x27;s hand, potentially enabling improved declarer play should they secure the contract.

==History==
In his seminal 1953 book, The Roth-Stone System, Alvin Roth suggested that poor matchpoint scores usually result when the opponents are permitted to play low-level contracts and recommended protective bidding tactics for the player in the pass-out (balancing) seat in such auctions.

He advocated use of weak jump overcalls and responses at a time when the standard practice was for jump overcalls and responses to show strong hands. In one such application - when the opponents reach the two-level having bid only a major – he recommended an overcall of 2NT, as an artificial protective bid indicating,
* a probable 9 (or more) points.
* strong minor suit holding – 5–4, 5-5 or better – and a request for partner to choose between the minor suits. If necessary, responder must bid a three-card minor suit.
* a warning against bidding the unbid major (however, the unbid major may be bid if self-sufficient).

==Current usage==
When an opponent opens the bidding with 1 or 1, the immediate overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the minor suits (that is, at least five clubs and at least five diamonds). If the right hand opponent (RHO) of the partner of the 2NT bid passes, that partner is expected to bid the minor suit that he prefers at the three-level. The unusual notrump applies the principle that when the natural meaning of a bid is not generally very useful, it is profitable to agree that it means something somewhat opposite. That is, while natural notrump bids show a strong hand with balanced distribution, the unusual notrump shows a weak hand with very unbalanced distribution.

If the 2NT bidder bids again freely, then it shows a &quot;strong&quot; two suiter. To distinguish the weak and strong holdings, many partnerships agree &quot;not&quot; to use the unusual notrump for intermediate hands (about 12 to 14 points); they would simply overcall with one of their suits and show the other later if the bidding offers a chance. However, for two-suiters, many players apply losing trick count (LTC) instead of point count, as it more accurately depicts the offensive trick-taking potential of the hand. With LTC in effect, the required strength is about 4.5–7 losers, the latter only in favorable vulnerability.

Similarly, a 4NT overcall shows an extreme two suiter (usually at least 6–5, often 6-6 or 7–6) and enough trick-taking potential so that a 5-level contract can be made, or a sacrifice will likely be profitable. It shows the same two suits as 2NT would show. Note that 4NT is &quot;unusual&quot; only when the opponents open the bidding; otherwise, 4NT is normally played as the Blackwood convention or a quantitative invitation to 6NT.

The Michaels cuebid is a similar convention which is used to show a two suiter with one or both major suits.

To counteract the unusual notrump, the opening side may employ unusual vs. unusual.

==Modifications==
Recently, the Unusual 2NT has been used in opening seat showing a 5-5 minor suited hand and 7-11 HCP. The preemptive value of the two suited hand puts pressure on the opponents to find their fits, games and slams at the three level.

==Defense==
When the opponents open or overcall with an Unusual 2NT, defense uses a bidding scheme which incorporates two features:
* the &#x27;double&#x27; becomes available as an additional call
* the concept of a major-minor pairing is adopted whereby diamonds are associated with spades and clubs with hearts. A cuebid of the paired minor shows a good holding in the corresponding major while a bid of a major shows a weaker holding.
After an Unusual 2NT overcall of a major:
After an Unusual 2NT opening:
==Drawbacks==
Use of the convention with insufficient strength or lengths (such as 5–4 in the minors) may lead to:

#Opponents doubling and collecting more penalty points than the contract points they would otherwise have scored.
#Opponents outbidding to obtain a major suit contract.
#Opponents making a contract owing to the additional information gained about the strength and distribution of the hand of the unusual notrump bidder.

<text>Christopher Wordsworth (9 June 1774 – 2 February 1846) was an English divine and scholar.

==Life==
Born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, he was the youngest brother of the poet William Wordsworth, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow in 1798.

Twelve years later he received the degree of DD. He took holy orders, and obtained successive preferments through the patronage of Charles Manners-Sutton, Bishop of Norwich, afterwards (1805) Archbishop of Canterbury, to whose son Charles (afterwards Speaker of the House of Commons, and Viscount Canterbury) he had been tutor. He had in 1802 attracted attention by his defence of Granville Sharp&#x27;s then novel canon &quot;on the uses of the definitive article&quot; in New Testament textual criticism.

In 1810 he published an Ecclesiastical Biography in 6 volumes. On the death of Bishop Mansel, in 1820, he was elected Master of Trinity, and retained that position till 1841, when he resigned. He is regarded as the father of the modern &quot;classical tripos,&quot; since he had, as vice-chancellor, originated in 1821 a proposal for a public examination in classics and divinity, which, though then rejected, bore fruit in 1822. Otherwise his mastership was undistinguished, and he was not a popular head with the college. He died on 2 February 1846, at Buxted, East Sussex.

In his &quot;Who wrote Eikon Basilike?&quot; (1824), and in other writings, he advocated the claims of Charles I to its authorship; and in 1836 he published, in 4 volumes, a work of &quot;Christian Institutes&quot;, selected from English divines. In 1804 he married Priscilla Lloyd (d. 1815), a sister of both Anna Braithwaite and Charles Lamb&#x27;s friend Charles Lloyd; they had three sons: John, Charles, and Christopher.

<text>.sh is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, although it is primarily used in Saint Helena (Ascension Island has its own ccTLD, .ac). Registrations of internationalized domain names are also accepted.

On 22 February 2010, the ISO 3166-1 code for Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha changed to reflect the SH used for the ccTLD.

==Second level domains==
There are seven second level domains:
* co.sh – commercial entities
* com.sh – commercial entities
* org.sh – non-profit organizations
* gov.sh – government departments and agencies
* edu.sh – educational institutions
* net.sh – network service providers
* nom.sh – non-island Internet sites

==Top-level domains==
A majority of sites under the .sh domain have nothing to do with Saint Helena, Ascension or Tristan da Cunha.

Members of DeviantArt are able to go to their &quot;stash,&quot; a service where digital media can be uploaded, stored and published. The DeviantArt &quot;stash&quot; uses the .sh top level domain &quot;sta.sh&quot;.

Sketch comedy YouTube channel Smosh uses the &quot;smo.sh&quot; domain name to link to addresses on their website, smosh.com. Similarly, the Babish Culinary Universe channel&#x27;s website uses the &quot;babi.sh&quot; domain name.

Skillshare uses the domain hack &quot;skl.sh&quot; to redirect to their website.

Since the .sh filename extension is also used by Unix shell scripts, this domain has been used for websites about command-line interface programs such as Homebrew.

SH is the official abbreviation for the German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein and the .sh domain is used for sites like &quot;nah.sh&quot;, a public transportation site as well as the Verbraucherzentrale (&quot;verbraucherzentrale.sh&quot;), the SPD party (&quot;spd.sh&quot;) and for some subpages by the official Schleswig-Holstein government (e.g. &quot;wahlen.sh&quot;).

The rhythm game osu! and the personal landing page of its primary developer uses the ppy.sh domain, such as osu.ppy.sh, old.ppy.sh, and status.ppy.sh.

The main fork of the popular movie torrent freeware program Popcorn Time is hosted at a .sh domain.

<text>The Legend of Mir 3 is a sprite based isometric 3-D massively multiplayer online role-playing game, developed by WeMade Entertainment. It is a sequel to &quot;The Legend of Mir 2&quot;.

The basic game mechanics remain largely unchanged from the previous version, with the exception of the graphics being upgraded from 8-bit color to 16-bit high color. There is also improved player customization, far larger maps, and a revamped quest system.

Like its predecessor &quot;The Legend of Mir 2&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Mir 3&quot; is hugely popular in China and South Korea. It was certified by the Guinness Book of Records for having 750,000 subscribers online.

By the time the game had closed in February 2012, it had 120 million registered users. The game also had a peak of 750,000 concurrent users online.

== Murder ==
In 2005, a dispute between two Chinese players of the game erupted into murder. Qiu Chengwei, who had won the Red Dragon Sabre, an in-game virtual sword, had lent the sword to his friend, Zhu Caoyuan, who then sold the sword on eBay for 7200 yuan ($870). This enraged Qiu who then stabbed Zhu to death.

<doc id="1238129" wikidata="Q1573535" url="?curid=1238129" title="Hamilton Naki">
<text>Hamilton Naki (26 June 1926 – 29 May 2005) was a South African laboratory assistant known for his contributions to surgical research and medical training despite having no formal medical training. He worked with cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at the University of Cape Town, where he was involved with organ transplant research on animals and trained medical students in surgical techniques. His contributions to medical science, particularly in an era of racial segregation and apartheid, have been recognized as remarkable.

Following his death, controversy arose regarding false claims in multiple obituaries, including those published by at least five periodicals and the Associated Press, that stated he participated in the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplantation in 1967. These statements were later retracted due to lack of evidence. The incident has been cited as an example of inadequate fact-checking in journalism, and delayed correction of reporting errors.

==Early life==
Naki was born to a poor family in Ngcingwane, a village in Centani in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. He received six years of education up to the age of 14, after which he moved to Cape Town. Beginning about 1940, he commuted from Langa, Cape Town to the University of Cape Town to work as a gardener, specifically rolling grass tennis courts.

==Medical career and retirement==
In 1954 Robert Goetz of the University&#x27;s surgical faculty asked Naki to assist him with laboratory animals. Naki&#x27;s responsibilities progressed from cleaning cages to performing anaesthesia. Most of Naki&#x27;s work under Goetz involved anaesthetising dogs, but Naki also assisted in operating on a giraffe &quot;to dissect the jugular venous valves to determine why giraffes do not faint when bending to drink.&quot;

Several years after Goetz left, Naki started working for Christiaan Barnard in the laboratory as an assistant. Barnard had studied open-heart surgery techniques in the United States and was bringing those techniques to South Africa. Naki first performed anaesthesia on animals for Barnard, but was then &quot;appointed principal surgical assistant of the laboratory because of his remarkable skill and dexterity.&quot; Barnard was quoted as saying &quot;If Hamilton had had the opportunity to study, he would probably have become a brilliant surgeon&quot; and that Naki was &quot;one of the great researchers of all time in the field of heart transplants&quot;.

In 1968, Barnard&#x27;s cardiac surgical research team moved out of the surgical laboratory, and Naki helped develop the heterotopic or &quot;piggyback&quot; heart transplantation technique. In the 1970s, Naki left Barnard&#x27;s team and returned to the surgical laboratory, this time working on liver transplantation. His contributions at this time were described as follows:
* Rosemary Hickman, transplantation surgeon whom Naki assisted and taught in the laboratory, and who worked with Naki for nearly 30 years: &quot;Despite his limited conventional education, he had an amazing ability to learn anatomical names and recognize anomalies. His skills ranged from assisting to operating and he frequently prepared the donor animal (sometimes single-handedly) while another team worked on the recipient.&quot;
* Del Khan, head of Groote Schuur Hospital&#x27;s organ transplant unit, whom Naki taught in the laboratory: &quot;A liver transplant on a pig in the U.S. would involve a team of two or three medically qualified surgeons… Hamilton can do this all on his own.&quot;
* Ralph Kirsch, head of the Liver Research Centre at the University of Cape Town: “He was one of those remarkable men who really come around once in a long time. As a man without any education, he mastered surgical techniques at the highest level and passed them on to young doctors.&quot;
* Barnard: &quot;A liver transplant is much more difficult than a heart transplant… [doctors who work with Naki] tell me that Hamilton can do all the various aspects of liver transplantation, which I can&#x27;t do. So technically, he is a better surgeon than I am.&quot;

Naki taught many students during his career; although newsmedia accounts placed the number of students in the thousands, Hickman said that that number appears to have been exaggerated. Naki assisted Hickman until his retirement in 1991, after which he received &quot;a gardener&#x27;s pension: 760 rand, or about $275, a month.&quot;

==Personal life, post-retirement activities and recognition, and death==
Naki was reported to be married with four sons and one daughter. He lived in a small one-room house without electricity or running water and sent &quot;most of his pay to his wife and family, left behind in Transkei,&quot; but &quot;could pay for only one of his five children to stay to the end of high school.&quot; He was active in his church and read the Bible frequently.

After retirement, Naki helped the community of Kentani, where part of his family lived, for example &quot;in the construction of a school and in the provision of a mobile clinic&quot; by soliciting donations from his &quot;medical contacts&quot;. He received public recognition of his medical work after his retirement, including:
* Metropolitan Eastern Cape Award, 2002.
* The Bronze Order of Mapungubwe, 2002, presented by President Thabo Mbeki. One of the highest South African civil honours, this Order is &quot;awarded to South African citizens for excellence and exceptional achievement.&quot;
* BTWSC Black S/Heroes Award, 2003.
* An honorary master&#x27;s degree from the University of Cape Town in 2003, presented by Chancellor Graça Machel. The honorary degree was described as MMed (Master of Medicine) in some sources and MSc (Master of Science) in others.
* Inclusion in a &quot;senior civil guard of honour&quot; at the 2004 opening of the Parliament of South Africa.
* In August 2017, the plain opposite the Christiaan Barnard Hospital in Cape Town was renamed from Salazar Plain to Hamilton Naki Square.

He died in Langa on 29 May 2005, aged 78, of &quot;heart trouble.&quot;

==Controversy concerning participation in 1967 heart transplantation==
After Naki&#x27;s death, obituaries published 9 June 2005 to 2 July 2005 in at least two medical journals (&quot;The BMJ&quot; and &quot;The Lancet&quot;), one magazine (&quot;The Economist&quot;), two newspapers (&quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;), and an unknown number of newspapers publishing Associated Press stories, printed obituaries that made the following claims about Naki&#x27;s participation in the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplantation:
* That Barnard had asked Groote Schuur Hospital for permission for Naki to be on the transplant team, and that permission was given in secret because of hospital rules and apartheid laws. Under apartheid, black health care providers could not have contact with white patients.
* That on 3 December 1967, Naki removed the heart of the deceased Denise Darvall, who was white, for transplantation into Louis Washkansky by Barnard.

Between 14 July 2005 and 3 September 2005, the five aforementioned periodicals and the Associated Press issued formal retractions of statements in their obituaries of Naki that claimed that he participated in the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplantation. The reasons given for the initial mistakes included:
* &quot;The Economist&quot; stated that its obituary was based on Naki&#x27;s &quot;own words in interviews,&quot; but that Naki&#x27;s role &quot;was gradually embellished in post-apartheid, black-ruled South Africa&quot; and that Naki came to believe the story himself. Furthermore, the magazine reported that the University of Cape Town did not initially deny the story because it appeared &quot;ridiculous.&quot;
* The author of the &quot;BMJ&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; obituaries wrote that she had &quot;relied on secondary sources&quot; such as &quot;The Economist&quot;.
* In an article published the same day as its correction, the &quot;New York Times&quot; concluded that reports that Naki was involved in the 1967 transplantation emerged &quot;most prominently&quot; in a 2003 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The 2003 article mentioned that &quot;a team led by Mr. Naki went to work, a 48-hour marathon&quot; to remove the donor heart.
* The Associated Press cited a reliance on previous (1993 and 2003) Associated Press articles.

Evidence cited in 2005 that Naki was not present at the first transplant included:
* Surgeons at the hospital where the 1967 transplantation was performed &quot;assured&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; that Naki &quot;was nowhere near the operating theatre.&quot;
* &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;a source close to&quot; Naki said that Naki said that he had heard of the first heart transplant &quot;on the radio.&quot;
* The chief of the laboratory in which Naki worked as of 1967 stated that Naki at the time was a scrub nurse and that Victor Pick was the surgical assistant; Naki became surgical assistant only after Pick died in the early 1970s and only &quot;at the experimental surgical operating table.&quot;
* Hickman was quoted as saying that Naki &quot;was an honest man and he wouldn&#x27;t have made that claim [of being present at the 1967 transplanation]&quot;.
* Filmmaker Dirk de Villiers stated that he heard Naki &quot;tell other people&quot; that he assisted in the transplant but did not say this to de Villiers in private.
* David Dent, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Cape Town University as of 2005, asserted that he worked with Naki &quot;on transplanting pigs&#x27; livers&quot; in 1967, but that technicians such as Naki did not perform surgeries in hospitals.
* In a letter to &quot;BMJ&quot;, Dent wrote that Naki &quot;did not participate in the first heart transplant, did not ever operate on humans, nor ever work in Groote Schuur Hospital…. The suggestion that Hamilton Naki performed the donor operation was never mentioned in life by the man himself, by the department of cardiac surgery, or by the university in his citation for his honorary degree in 2003. It was not mentioned after his death at his family funeral, or at the memorial service in the medical school experimental laboratory.&quot;
* Chris Logan, author of a biography of Barnard, wrote that Naki &quot;did not at any stage assist in the first or subsequent human heart transplant operations, nor could he have done under the apartheid laws at the time&quot;.
* It was effectively illegal for blacks to do surgery on whites under apartheid, and it is beyond the bounds of probability that an untrained black technician would have been permitted to undertake such an operation, or that his participation in such a high-profile operation at a leading white hospital could have avoided public notice during apartheid.

Instead, the surgeons who removed the heart from the donor were Marius Barnard (Christiaan Barnard&#x27;s brother) and Terry O&#x27;Donovan.

Despite the retractions, the claim that Naki participated in the 1967 heart transplantation has been perpetuated in journal articles and books published after 2005. Examples include:
* &quot;In December 1967… Naki, with amazing dexterity, removed the donor heart from Darval, irrigated it with electrolyte solution and passed it to Barnard.&quot;
* &quot;1967 Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard of South Africa performed the world&#x27;s first human heart transplant operation… Working with a team that included… black South African surgeon Hamilton Naki….&quot;
* &quot;One of the most interesting people I learned and read about was Hamilton Naki. He assisted Dr. Barnard with the first transplant in 1967….&quot;

A 2007 book traced the origin of the incorrect story to a 1993 article in the Associated Press that stated &quot;Barnard had Naki on his heart-transplant backup team. … When Barnard performed the first heart transplant in 1967, Naki was part of the backup team at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town.&quot; The story&#x27;s &quot;blossom[ing] into accepted fact&quot; was partly attributed to neither Barnard&#x27;s nor Naki&#x27;s taking steps to refute the story. The 2007 book noted that the 2005 corrections in the newsmedia &quot;did not include any statement about adopting new procedures to prevent the same thing from happening again.&quot;

A documentary film &quot;Hidden Heart&quot; which was released widely in 2009 included interviews with Christiaan Barnard and Naki suggesting that Naki was present at the 1967 heart transplantation. Marius Barnard was quoted as describing the claims in the film that Naki removed the donor heart as &quot;rubbish, a joke, it’s a total distortion of the facts&quot; and as stating that Naki was at the time &quot;in his bed, about 8 km away from Groote Schuur&quot;. The co-director of the film &quot;acknowledge[d] that Naki was not present the night of the operation.&quot; A South African Broadcasting Corporation investigation after the release of the film quoted five people about the event:
* Tollie Lambrechts, a member of the transplantation team, said Naki &quot;was definitely not in the operating room on that night.&quot;
* Dene Friedmann, a member of the transplantation team, said Naki &quot;was not here that night, the only people here were the ones that would actually do the work. Hamilton never worked in the theatres. He wasn’t allowed to operate on a human being without a medical and surgical degree.&quot;
* Hickman said that Naki&#x27;s being there was &quot;highly unlikely.&quot;
* The former wife of Barnard stated that Barnard &quot;never mentioned Naki was there the evening of the first transplant.&quot;
* Naki’s youngest son said that Naki was &quot;the one who took out the heart and gave it to Chris Barnard.&quot; However, his son could not have been a witness to the operation, and was more likely to have heard the myth later.

The German surgeon Stefan von Sommoggy, who worked with Naki in South Africa for a year and, unlike many of his South African white colleagues, was on friendly terms with him, denied in a letter to the editor of the renowned German medical newspaper &quot;Ärzteblatt&quot; in response to the documentary &quot; Hidden Heart&quot; that Naki&#x27;s participation in the operation in any form could be ruled out for two reasons. Firstly, due to the colour of his skin but also due to his lack of medical qualifications, he was not able to access the surgical area. Secondly, Naki&#x27;s technical skills were quite limited. Although he was able to show students how to transplant dog hearts, his crude technique due to the lack of medical training made it impossible for him to show the much more difficult pig heart transplant. Von Sommoggy referred to Naki as a friend who, under the circumstances of his life, could not be capable of such a feat. All the more he emphasized Naki&#x27;s desire to be able to do something for the education of future generations, so that they would have the basics that are needed for such specialized activities.

<text>John Knight Shields (August 15, 1858September 30, 1934) was a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1913 to 1925. He also served as an associate justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court.

==Biography==
Shields was born at his family&#x27;s estate &quot;Clinchdale&quot;, near the early pioneer settlement of Bean&#x27;s Station, Tennessee in Grainger County. His education as a youth was by private tutors, a sign of the family&#x27;s affluence. He studied law and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1879. He practiced in the counties surrounding his home until 1893, when he was named Chancellor of the former 12th Chancery Division. The next year, he resumed private practice in nearby Morristown, in Hamblen County.

In 1902, Shields was nominated in the Democratic primary to succeed retiring incumbent David L. Snodgrass to become an associate justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court, an office which he held until 1910 when he was named chief justice. He resigned that post in 1913, becoming the last Tennessean elected to the U.S. Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly prior to the 17th Amendment coming into effect. Shields was popularly reelected in 1918 but in 1924 lost the Democratic nomination to Lawrence Tyson, and returned to the private practice of law, this time in Knoxville.

While in the Senate, Shields served as the chairman of several committees. He chaired the Committee on Canadian Relations in the 63rd and 64th Congresses, the Committee on Interoceanic Canals in the 65th Congress, and the Committee on the Sale of Meat Products in the 66th Congress.

Shields died at his estate &quot;Clinchdale&quot; and is buried in Knoxville&#x27;s Memorial Cemetery.

<doc id="1238143" wikidata="Q1929070" url="?curid=1238143" title="Michael Robinson (footballer)">
<text>Michael John Robinson (12 July 1958 – 28 April 2020) was a professional footballer who played as a striker.

He appeared in more than 300 official matches in England for Preston North End, Manchester City, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Liverpool and Queens Park Rangers and played the last three seasons of his career in Spain with Osasuna. He represented the Republic of Ireland at international level.

Robinson settled in Spain after retiring in 1989 and went on to work as a television pundit in the following decades, hosting &quot;El día después&quot; from 1991 to 2005.

==Playing career==
Robinson was born in Leicester, England. When he was young, his parents moved to Blackpool to run a boarding house, and he started his career with Preston North End in the second division. He then moved in August 1979 to Malcolm Allison&#x27;s Manchester City, the fee of £750,000 being widely regarded as extravagant for a young player with no First Division experience; he was sold at a loss later that season to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, and rebuilt his reputation as both a strong and skilful attacking player.

Robinson made an impact in the 1982–83 FA Cup final, feeding the ball to Gordon Smith for his infamous miss in the first game with Manchester United, performing outstandingly in a 2–2 draw but eventually losing in the second match at Wembley (4–0). It was enough, however, for clubs to bid for him and he was keen to leave due to Brighton&#x27;s relegation.

Liverpool came in for Robinson and paid Brighton £250,000 for him and he duly battled with established Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush for a place up front. In that first season his new team won three trophies – the league, the league cup (where he was a substitute in the final 0–0 draw against Everton, and did not feature in the replay) and the European Cup (being used as a replacement in the final against AS Roma)– and he played enough games to earn a title medal.

Despite showing some ability, Robinson was often on the substitutes&#x27; bench, and so moved on to Queens Park Rangers at the end of 1984. There, he was an unlucky loser at Wembley again, in the 1986 Football League Cup final 3–0 defeat by Oxford United; however, during the run to the decisive match, he earned himself a place in QPR fans&#x27; hearts when he scored a 40-yard goal against arch-rivals Chelsea in the quarter-final replay at Stamford Bridge.

Robinson moved to Spain to play for CA Osasuna in January 1987, with ex-Liverpool teammate Sammy Lee joining in August. He recalled that he assumed that Osasuna was the name of the club&#x27;s location and proceeded to look for it in a map. Questioned about why would he choose such a destination, he remarked that &quot;financially it was the worst offer [available]. But it was romantic&quot;. He retired in summer 1989 at the age of 31 after making 58 La Liga appearances and scoring 12 goals, two of which came in 1987–88 campaign as the Navarrese overachieved for a final fifth place.

Robinson, who won 24 caps for the Republic of Ireland, making his debut on 28 October 1980 in a 2–0 loss in France for the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, stayed in Spain after retiring, having settled very well in the country and learned the language to fluency, a trait that was later picked up on by Steve McManaman (with Real Madrid from 1999 to 2003), who regarded Robinson as his mentor.



==Media career==
After retiring, Robinson began his broadcasting career in Spain as a commentator for Radio Televisión Española, covering the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. He later worked as a commentator and presenter on Cadena SER&#x27;s &quot;El Larguero&quot; and then on the subscription channel Canal+, where he hosted the cult television show &quot;El día después&quot; for 14 years (1991–2005). Following the show&#x27;s demise he continued working with the network, as co-commentator on their live coverage of the Sunday night match as well as on the studio show &quot;El día del fútbol&quot;, and later by presenting a monthly sports magazine series called &quot;Informe Robinson&quot;.

Speaking to Simon Hughes, Robinson said &quot;I came over on 7 January 1987. I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to be here forever. But something strange happened. I enjoyed more or less everything about Spain and the way the Spanish interpreted life. I finished up realising that I had loads in common with the Spaniards. We laughed about the same things, cried about the same things.&quot;

In addition, Robinson also worked as a pundit for Setanta Sports, covering Republic of Ireland away internationals and also being the president of the Iberian Superleague, a rugby union league covering the Iberian Peninsula. As a broadcaster he also covered for Canal+ rugby events, including the World Cup and the Six Nations Championship.

Robinson also did voice-over work on television adverts as well as feature films, voicing the ugly sister in the dubbed Spanish versions of the &quot;Shrek&quot; films by DreamWorks Animation.

==Illness and death==
On 17 December 2018, while taking part in &quot;La Ventana&quot;, a radio programme on Cadena SER, Robinson announced that he had a malignant melanoma which had been found at an advanced stage and had metastasized. Doctors had told him it &#x27;had no cure&#x27;. He died on 28 April 2020 of cancer at his home in Madrid at the age of 61, being survived by his wife Christine (née Sharrock) and children Liam, who worked in television production in Madrid, and Aimée, who worked in public relations in Australia.

Among the tributes was one from Rafael Nadal: &quot;We woke up with the sad news of the death of one of our own. You were the one who always made us happy about sport. We are grateful to you.&quot;

<text>The United States President&#x27;s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the global health funding by the United States to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and help save the lives of those suffering from the disease. The U.S. allocation of over $110 billion marks the largest investment any country has ever made toward combating a single disease. As of 2023, PEPFAR has saved over 25 million lives, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

Launched by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2003, as of May 2020, PEPFAR has provided cumulative funding for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and research since its inception, making it the largest global health program focused on a single disease in history until the COVID-19 pandemic. PEPFAR is implemented by a combination of U.S. government agencies in over 50 countries and overseen by the Global AIDS Coordinator at the United States Department of State.

The PEPFAR program has in recent years been criticized by members of the Republican Party who have sought to block its re-authorization. Republicans alleged that the program promoted abortion. In 2025, the Donald Trump administration put the program on halt and took PEPFAR’s computer systems offline.

On January 28, 2025 the Trump administration granted a waiver for essential medicines and medical services, temporarily restoring a global HIV treatment program that had been suspended the previous week. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the waiver, which appeared to permit the distribution of HIV medications. However, it remained unclear whether the exemption covered preventive drugs or additional services provided through PEPFAR. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), who is a medical doctor, posted on February 4, 2025 that money for PEPFAR does not seem to be flowing.

==History==

PEPFAR began with President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, and their interests in AIDS prevention, Africa, and what Bush termed “compassionate conservatism.” According to his 2010 memoir, &quot;Decision Points&quot;, the two of them developed a serious interest in improving the fate of the people of Africa after reading Alex Haley’s &quot;&quot;, and visiting The Gambia in 1990. In 1998, while pondering a run for the U.S. presidency, he discussed Africa with Condoleezza Rice, his future secretary of state; she said that, if elected, working more closely with countries on that continent should be a significant part of his foreign policy. She also told him that HIV/AIDS was a central problem in Africa but that the United States was spending only $500 million per year on global AIDS, with the money spread across six federal agencies, without a clear strategy for curbing the epidemic.

The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (or the Global AIDS Act) specified a series of broad and specific goals, alternately delegating authority to the president for identifying measurable outcomes in some areas, and specifying by law the quantitative benchmarks to be reached within discrete periods of time in others. The legislation also established the State Department Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to oversee all international AIDS funding and programming.

PEPFAR continues to be a cornerstone of U.S. global health efforts. On April 4, 2014, Ambassador Deborah L. Birx was sworn in as United States Global AIDS Coordinator. She held the position until January 2021 when Angeli Achrekar filled the Acting role, from being Principal Deputy.

In May 2022, Dr. John N. Nkengasong was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and was officially sworn in on June 13, 2022. On August 1, 2023, Ambassador Nkengasong joined U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to launch the State Department’s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which he led until the second cabinet of Donald Trump assumed office on January20, 2025.

In December 2014, PEPFAR announced a program PEPFAR 3.0 focusing on Sustainable Control of the AIDS epidemic. This program was designed to address the UNAIDS &quot;90-90-90&quot; global goal: 90 percent of people with HIV diagnosed, 90 percent of them on ART and 90 percent of them virally suppressed by the year 2020.

=== PEPFAR under second Trump presidency ===

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14155 initiating the United States’ withdrawal from the World Health Organization. This happened along with Executive Order 14169 to freeze foreign aid, impacting global health programs including PEPFAR.

Subsequently, the U.S. State Department announced a comprehensive freeze on new funding for most foreign aid programs worldwide, excluding emergency food aid and military assistance to Israel and Egypt. 
This suspension affected billions of dollars allocated for health, education, development, and other aid initiatives, with no exemptions for programs like PEPFAR. Humanitarian organizations were alarmed.

The International AIDS Society (IAS) warned that the immediate halting of funding to PEPFAR, including a stop-work order for existing grants and contracts, threatened millions of lives. More than 20 million people living with HIV globally, including 550,000 children under 15, depended on daily services provided with support from the PEPFAR program. These actions led to widespread concern about the future of HIV/AIDS programs and the potential reversal of progress made in combating the epidemic.

==Focus countries==

When PEPFAR was signed into law 15 resource-limited countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates were designated to receive the majority of the funding. The 15 &quot;focus countries&quot; were Botswana, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia. Most of the $15 billion for the program was to be spent on these focus countries, $4 billion was allocated for programs elsewhere, and for HIV/AIDS research (the other $1 billion was contributed to the Global Fund).

With the reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008 there was a shift away from the &quot;focus country&quot; approach by authorizing the development of a Partnership Framework model for regions and countries, with the aim of ensuring long-term sustainability and country leadership. Through bilaterally-funded programs, PEPFAR works in partnership with host nations to support treatment, prevention and care for millions of people in more than 85 countries. Partnership Frameworks provide a 5-year joint strategic framework for cooperation between the U.S. Government, the partner government, and other partners to combat HIV/AIDS in the host country through service delivery, policy reform, and coordinated financial commitments.See the PEPFAR World Wide Activities Map and PEPFAR Dashboard.

==Implementing agencies==
=== Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) ===
Housed in the Department of State, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator oversees the implementation of PEPFAR and ensures coordination among the various agencies involved in the U.S global response to HIV/AIDS. United States Ambassadors from the State Department provide essential leadership to interagency HIV/AIDS teams and engage in policy discussions with host-country leaders.

=== U.S. Agency for International Development ===
An independent federal agency, USAID receives overall foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State and is the agency primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid. USAID supports the implementation of PEPFAR programs in nearly 100 countries, through direct in-country presence in 50 countries and through seven other regional programs.

=== Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ===
Under PEPFAR, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implements PEPFAR-funded prevention, treatment and care programs through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The Office of Global Health Affairs within HHS coordinates all of the HHS agencies to be sure PEPFAR resources are being used effectively.

=== Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ===
As part of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses PEPFAR funding to implement its Global AIDS Program (GAP). GAP works with highly trained physicians, epidemiologists, public health advisers, behavioral scientists, and laboratory scientists in 29 countries, who are part of USG teams implementing PEPFAR. Through partnerships with host governments, Ministries of Health, NGOs, international organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector, GAP assists with HIV prevention, treatment, and care; laboratory capacity building; surveillance; monitoring and evaluation; and public health evaluation research.

=== Department of Defense (DoD) ===
The Department of Defense (DoD) implements PEPFAR programs by supporting HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, strategic information, human capacity development and program/policy development in host military and civilian communities. The DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) is the DoD Executive Agent for the technical assistance, management, and administrative support of the global HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment for foreign militaries.

=== Department of Commerce (DoC) ===
The Department of Commerce (DoC) provides support for PEPFAR by furthering private sector engagement through public-private partnerships. Housed within DoC, the U.S. Census Bureau assists with data management and analysis, survey support, estimating infections averted and supporting mapping of country-level activities.

=== Department of Labor (DoL) ===
The Department of Labor (DoL) implements PEPFAR workplace-targeted projects that focus on the prevention and reduction of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination. DoL programs (in over 23 countries) consist of three main components: increasing knowledge about HIV/AIDS, implementing workplace policies to reduce stigma and discrimination and building capacity of employers to provide support services.

=== Peace Corps ===
With programs in 73 countries, the Peace Corps is heavily involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Peace Corps volunteers provide long-term capacity development support to nongovernmental, community-based, and faith-based organizations as they provide holistic support to people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.

==Programs==

The U.S. President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief: Five-Year Strategy report from 2009 outlines the PEPFAR strategy and programs for the fiscal years 2010-2014.

=== Prevention ===
To slow the spread of the epidemic, PEPFAR supports a variety of prevention programs: the ABC approach (Abstain, Be faithful, and correct and consistent use of Condoms); prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) interventions; and programs focusing on blood safety, injection safety, secondary prevention (&quot;prevention with positives&quot;), counseling and education.

Initially, a recommended 20% of the PEPFAR budget was to be spent on prevention, with the remaining 80% going to care and treatment, laboratory support, antiretroviral drugs, TB/HIV services, support for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), infrastructure, training, and other related services. Of the 20% spent on prevention, one third, or 6.7% of the total, was to be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs in fiscal years 2006 through 2008, a controversial requirement (see below). The other two thirds was allotted for the widespread array of prevention interventions described above, including counseling, education, injection safety, blood safety and condoms.

The 2008 reauthorization of PEPFAR eliminated the 20% recommendation for prevention efforts, including the requirement for abstinence programs.

=== Treatment ===
In addition to providing antiretroviral therapy (ART), PEPFAR supports prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections, as well as services to prevent and treat malaria, tuberculosis, waterborne illness, and other acute infections. PEPFAR supports training and salaries for personnel (including clinicians, laboratorians, pharmacists, counselors, medical records staff, outreach workers, peer educators, etc.), renovation and refurbishment of health care facilities, updated laboratory equipment and distribution systems, logistics and management for drugs and other commodities. This is intended to ensure the sustainability of PEPFAR services in host countries, enabling long-term management of HIV/AIDS.

PEPFAR-supported care and treatment services are implemented by a wide array of U.S.-based and international groups and agencies. Among the largest &quot;Track 1.0&quot; (treatment) partners are Harvard University, Columbia University&#x27;s International Center for AIDS Care &amp; Treatment Programs (ICAP), the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), and the AIDSRelief consortium of Catholic Relief Services.

=== Care ===
For those who have already been infected with HIV/AIDS, PEPFAR provides HIV counseling, resources for maintaining financial stability, etc. Special care is given to orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) and services are provided that meet the unique needs of women and girls, including victims of sex trafficking, rape, abuse, and exploitation (see fact sheet on Gender and HIV/AIDS). Finally, the Emergency Plan works closely with country leaders, military groups, faith-based organizations, etc. in an attempt to eliminate stigma.

=== Health Systems Strengthening ===
PEPFAR has directly and indirectly contributed to the health systems strengthening of recipient countries including improving laboratory capacity as well as improving monitoring and evaluation including introduction of the electronic medical record systems. Another area of health system strengthening that PEPFAR has contributed to is its ability to increase the pandemic response to other infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Research by Anand Reddi and colleagues has documented the effectiveness and sustainability of PEPFAR programs by emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to HIV care that can strengthen overall health systems in resource limited settings.

=== Antiretroviral Local Manufacturing ===
The U.S. government is supporting African production of antiretrovirals (ARVs) to address the continent&#x27;s HIV epidemic. In July 2024, PEPFAR plans to expand its purchase of ARVs from local suppliers to serve 2 million African patients.

==Results==
The results of the program include:
* As of December 2024, PEPFAR has saved 26 million lives verses 25 million lives saved in 2023.
* As of September 30, 2024, PEPFAR supported antiretroviral treatment for 20.6 million people worldwide including 566,000 children verses the 20.47 million people worldwide on treatment in 2023.
* In 2024, PEPFAR supported 2.5 million people newly enrolled on PrEP to prevent HIV infection. IN 2023, PEPFAR supported 1.95 million people on antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
* PEPFAR supported 2.3 million adolescent girls and young women through the DREAM HIV prevention services in FY 2024 verses 2.5 million in FY2023. PrEP initiations in DREAM geographies was 475,000 clients in FY 2024. 
* PEPFAR directly supported 83.8 million people with HIV testing services an increase of 12 million more people since 2023 in which 71 million people were test in fiscal year 2023.
* PEPFAR supported antiretroviral drug prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), resulting in 5.5 million babies born HIV-free. 
* PEPFAR directly supported 6.6 million orphans, vulnerable children and their caregivers in fiscal year 2024 a slight decrease from 2023.
* PEPFAR directly supported approximately 35.1 million voluntary male circumcision procedures worldwide cumulatively from 2017 through Dec 2024 an increase of 2.7 million in FY 2024 from 2023.

The U.S. is the first and largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. To date, the U.S. has provided more than $7 billion to the fund.

Of the estimated 8 million individuals in low- and middle-income countries who currently receive treatment, nearly 6.8 million receive support through PEPFAR bilateral programs, the Global Fund, or both.

There is additional evidence in the published literature that funding towards PEPFAR vis-a-vis antiretroviral therapy also affirmed maternal and child health in addition to HIV treatment outcomes

==Accountability and funding==

Since the start of PEPFAR in 2003, the program has utilized multi-year appropriations. PEPFAR reports to Congress on an annual basis, providing programmatic and financial data as required by law. The Fourteenth Annual Report to Congress on the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is available on the official PEPFAR website, as are more specific reports, financial information and other information.

Global AIDS funding is provided in the Foreign Operations and Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bills, which, if the process goes smoothly, are agreed to by the House and Senate in advance of the federal fiscal year beginning October 1. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) budgets according to the allocations provided by Congress and the policy of the Administration. Funding figures by program are reported to Congress by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.

For FY 2013, President Obama requested $6.42 billion, including more than $4.54 billion for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs and $1.65 billion for the Global Fund. For FY 2014, President Obama requested $6.73 billion, including more than $4.88 billion for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs and $1.65 billion for the Global Fund.

For FY 2024, President Biden requested at least $4.7 billion for the PEPFAR program in its annual budget request to Congress in addition to funding for the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

PEPFAR was exempt from the Mexico City Policy.

==Funding data==

Annual data on the PEPFAR budget, spending by budget code, and impact estimates are available online at PEPFAR Panorama Spotlight. Funding amounts to specific in-country implementing mechanisms and partners are only available for the year 2013 onward.

In 2008, funding data was obtained by the Center for Public Integrity from PEPFAR&#x27;s own information system COPRS. The data were obtained after CPI sued the U.S. State Department to gain access to the data. The data were analyzed by the HIV/AIDS Monitor team at the Center for Global Development, who also share the full dataset.

==Criticism==

=== Controversial requirements ===
Some critics of PEPFAR feel that American political and social groups with moral rather than public health agendas are behind several requirements of PEPFAR, pointing to the mandates that one-third of prevention spending in 2006–2008 be directed towards abstinence-until-marriage programs and that all funded organizations sign an anti-prostitution pledge. This pledge requires all organizations that receive PEPFAR funding to have a policy that explicitly opposes prostitution and sex trafficking which some activists compared to a loyalty oath. A number of AIDS organizations felt such a policy would alienate their efforts to reduce HIV contraction rates among sex workers.

In 2005, it was reported from United Nations&#x27; envoy leader for HIV/AIDS in Africa Stephen Lewis that the Bush administration&#x27;s abstinence policy may have contributed to a shortage of condoms in Uganda.

In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the requirement violated the First Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against compelled speech in &quot;Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.&quot; According to a study presented at the 19th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in 2015, the $1.3 billion that the U.S. government spent on programs to promote abstinence in sub-Saharan Africa had no significant impact.

The requirement for prevention spending was lifted with the PEPFAR reauthorization in 2008, but some critics worry that some funds could still be spent on abstinence programs. The Center for Health and Gender Equity and Health GAP outline their criticism of PEPFAR on a website known as PEPFAR Watch. The previous 33% earmark has since been replaced by a requirement that if more than 50% of PEPFAR funds are allocated to non-abstinence promotion measures, the US Global AIDS Coordinator must report to Congress. However, the new reporting requirement continues to emphasize abstinence and fidelity to the exclusion of comprehensive approaches, such as those that include education about male and female condoms. This can cause a chilling effect for organizations receiving PEPFAR funding, who may censor their prevention activities and fall short of providing comprehensive HIV prevention services to women, men, and young people.

PEPFAR also does not fund needle exchange programs, which are widely regarded as effective in preventing the spread of HIV.

=== Conditions ===
Many have argued that PEPFAR&#x27;s emphasis on direct funding from the United States to African governments (bilateral programs) have been at the expense of full commitments to multilateral programs such as the Global Fund. Reasons given for this vary, but a major criticism has been that this enables the U.S. &quot;to maximize its leverage with other countries through the funds available for distribution&quot; since the &quot;Global Fund and other multilateral venues do not possess the same top-down leverage as does the United States in demanding fundamental national-level reforms&quot;. However, since the inception of PEPFAR there has been a shift away from strictly bilateral funding to more multilateral programs.

=== Recruitment of locals ===
PEPFAR has been criticized for having a negative impact on the health systems in regions receiving its funding through its recruitment practices. Although Congress made attempts to limit its impact by prohibiting &quot;topping off&quot; salaries and limiting funding for healthcare worker training (thereby eliminating per diems as a method of augmenting salaries), PEPFAR funded programs effectively paid its local staff up to a hundred times more than that of the local healthcare structure.

Rather than strictly through salaries, program staff received benefits such as housing and education subsidies. Countries, already stressed by the number of trained physicians and nurses emigrating to western nations, have seen the presence of PEPFAR programs significantly decrease the number of skilled medical professionals willing to work within the domestic healthcare infrastructure. As a result, the overall health of these communities are placed in jeopardy, but funds, physicians, and nurses are diverted to combat HIV/AIDS exclusively within the framework of PEPFAR.

===Investigations===
On June 15, 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report critical of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s (CDC&#x27;s) administration of PEPFAR funds. The report read in part: &quot;Our review found that CDC did not always monitor recipients&#x27; use of [PEPFAR] funds in accordance with departmental and other Federal requirements... [M]ost of the award files did not include all required documents&quot; to demonstrate proper monitoring. On the November 19, 2012, the OIG published a report critical of the CDC Namibia Office&#x27;s monitoring of the use of PEPFAR funds.

<doc id="1238163" wikidata="Q7012358" url="?curid=1238163" title="New Waver">
<text>New Waver was an Australian satirical musical project developed by Greg Wadley in 1990. It grew out of Wadley&#x27;s prior projects, a zine &quot;Loser&quot;, a mock political action group, Campaign Against Uninteresting Shops in Brunswick Street and a fictitious tribute band, Christmas Party.

== History ==

New Waver was founded by Greg Wadley in 1990 in Melbourne. Wadley, on bass guitar, was a founding member of Tex Perkins&#x27; Brisbane-formed cowpunk band, Tex Deadly and the Dum Dums, in 1982. Fellow member Peter Jetnikoff provided guitar. They relocated to Sydney but disbanded in the following year. Wadley established the Losercorp project in the 1980s, which published a zine &quot;Loser&quot; (1987–1992) under the pseudonyms A Loser and Arthur Protestant, formed a mock political action group, Campaign Against Uninteresting Shops in Brunswick Street and a fictitious tribute band, Christmas Party. 

New Waver, was the music project of Wadley, which has a similar pessimistic outlook to Losercorp&#x27;s earlier efforts, underwritten with Darwinism. Its music consists of electronic elements (from synthesisers, samplers and drum machines), along with samples from TV nature programmes, advertisements and audio books by Richard Dawkins, selectively chosen to reinforce the bleak, fatalistic message, coupled with dark humour. The New Waver world view extends the survival of the fittest hypothesis to the social ladder present in modern urban and suburban culture. The songs feature both cover versions and parodies of well-known songs with lyrics altered to reflect their world view, as well as instrumentals populated with samples and loops. The term &quot;New Waver&quot; is 1980s-vintage pejorative Queensland slang for a male who is interested in music, rather than football, and thus deserving of harassment or violence. &quot;New Waver&quot; also became a term for those who were fans of new wave music throughout the 1980s.

New Waver issued their first music cassette, &quot;Middle Class Man&quot;, in 1990. According to a reviewer for &quot;Radiation from Space Magazine&quot;, it is &quot;esoteric, weird and wild keyboard and samples, blended with drums, bass and odd guitar they created a hypnotic groove.&quot; The title track is a parody of &quot;Working Class Man&quot; (1985) by Jimmy Barnes, while &quot;Teabreak&quot; relates to AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Jailbreak&quot; (1976).

In 1998, the band was one of many in the music video &quot;Thunderbirds Are Coming Out&quot; by fellow Australian band TISM. For New Waver&#x27;s album, &quot;The Defeated&quot; (1999), Zyklatt provided drum loops. Most of its original tracks were written by Wadley however, former bandmate, Jetnikoff wrote the track, &quot;Struggle for Hogwash&quot;, for the album. In 2006 a compilation album, &quot;Neuters&quot;, was issued, its &quot;music consisted of dinky covers of Top 40 hits with the lyrics changed to address the life of the office loser.&quot; Guy Blackman of &quot;The Age&quot; described the band&#x27;s members, &quot;two unassuming public-servant types lurking behind cheesy synthesisers, with a singer who began most gigs naked, putting on an item of clothing after each song in a deadpan inversion of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll behaviour.&quot; There is an interview with Wadley in Iain McIntyre and Mike Munro&#x27;s book, &quot;How to Make Trouble and Influence People&quot; (2009).

<doc id="1238172" wikidata="Q6919779" url="?curid=1238172" title="Mount Bonnell">
<text>Mount Bonnell , also known as Covert Park, is a prominent point alongside the Lake Austin portion of the Colorado River in Austin, Texas. It has been a popular tourist destination since the 1850s. The mount provides a vista for viewing the city of Austin, Lake Austin, and the surrounding hills. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969, bearing Marker number 6473, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

==Geography==
Mount Bonnell is often described as the highest point in Austin, with the elevation at its peak about above mean sea level (AMSL). If Mount Bonnell ever held this distinction, it was only because the city limits did not include the next summit to the north, Mount Barker, which has an elevation of about above mean sea level. City of Austin records, however, indicate that the city annexed for &quot;full purpose jurisdiction&quot; both Mt. Bonnell and Mt. Barker as part of the same parcel &quot;on or before&quot; 1951; Mt. Bonnell entered the city limits with its higher neighbor, Mt. Barker. Many other areas now in the city of Austin are also higher than Mount Bonnell, but few publicly accessible spots offer such a sweeping view of the downtown area.

==History==

===Mount Bonnell&#x27;s Indian Trail===
A historical marker was placed at Mount Bonnell in 1969 by State Historical Survey Committee. The marker reads:

Years after Bigfoot Wallace&#x27;s refuge in the cave on Mount Bonnell, when asked why he had chosen the cave as a refuge, he responded &quot;Well the cave was right on the old Indian trail leading down to Austin ... and besides, the cave was in the best hunting ground for bear in all this country..&quot;

=== Julia Lee Sinks ===
Julia L. Sinks, author and historian, was an early settler to Austin, arriving in the spring of 1840. Before meeting and marrying George Sinks, chief clerk of the Post Office Department during the Republic years, she lived on West Pecan, present day 6th street, and later wrote &quot;Our home was on the beaten track of the Indians into town from the pass of Mount Bonnell. The knolls beyond the quarry branch were interspersed with timber, and sometimes though not often, we would see galloping past the open spaces beyond the blanketed Indian. The path along the quarry branch, secluded as it was, became their main inlet to the town. It was a sheltered road, never traveled at night by whites, so the Indians claimed right of way, and all full moons brought moccasin tracks in abundance&quot;.

=== Abduction of Simpson Children ===
If Mount Bonnell was on an Indian trail into Austin, it was also a trail out, as illustrated in another story included in Wilbarger&#x27;s book, Indian Depredations of Texas. In 1842, a Mrs. Simpson living on that very same street as Julia Lee Sinks, West Pecan, about three blocks west of Congress, had two children – a daughter 14, a son 12—abducted by Indians while the children were in the adjacent &quot;valley&quot; (Shoal Creek). Wilbarger says that at that time there were no houses there. The Indians &quot;seized the children, mounted their horses and made off for the mountains going in the direction of Mt. Bonnell&quot;. A posse was raised and gave pursuit. Wilbarger then says &quot;At one time the citizens came within sight of the redskins just before reaching Mt. Bonnell, but the Indians, after arriving at the place, passed on just beyond to the top of the mountain, which being rocky, the citizens lost the trail and were never able to find where the savages went down the mountain&quot;.
The Simpson girl was killed, but the boy survived and was later &quot;traded off to some Indian traders, who returned him to his mother&quot;. It is because the boy survived and was returned home that we know what happened after the posse lost the trail of the Indians on Mount Bonnell. From Mt. Bonnell they stopped at Spicewood Springs, &quot;which is situated in the edge of the mountains&quot;. This is where the Simpson girl was killed. Spicewood Springs is located about 5 miles north of Mount Bonnell, at the present day intersections of Mopac Expressway and Spicewood Springs Road.

===Origin of the name===
Mount Bonnell is generally believed to have been named after early Texas newspaper publisher George W. Bonnell, who moved to Texas in 1836. George W. Bonnell was publisher of the local paper &quot;The Texas Sentinel&quot; and was prominent in early Texas and Travis County (Austin) affairs after the War for Independence. Though sources have long credited George Bonnell as the mountain&#x27;s namesake, Albert Sidney Johnston may have named Mount Bonnell in present-day Austin for his friend and fellow West Point graduate Joseph Bonnell, who was a Captain in the Texas Army during the War for Independence. There is little contemporaneous evidence to support either derivation of the name.

Legend has it that Mount Bonnell was once called Antoinette&#x27;s Leap, after a young woman who leaped to her death to avoid being captured by Native Americans who had killed her fiancé.

==Geology==
Mt. Bonnell forms part of the Balcones Fault Escarpment and these &quot;balconies&quot; were first described by Bernardo de Miranda in 1756. The lower Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation limestone outcrops to the west of the fault zone but is buried 1000 feet to the east.

A stratigraphic column starts with the Lower Cretaceous Trinity Group overlain by the Edwards Group and the Georgetown Formation. Upper Cretaceous formations follow, starting with the Del Rio Clay, Buda Limestone, and then the Eagle Ford Group. Formations within the Trinity Group include the Hammett Formation, Cow Creek Formation, Hensel Formation, and Lower and Upper Glen Rose Formation. The Hammett and the lower portion of the Upper Glen Rose act as confining units (or aquitard) for the Middle Trinity Aquifer. The Upper Glen Rose contains the Upper Trinity Aquifer, which appears to have intra-aquifer groundwater flow with the Edwards Aquifer as water levels are at the same elevation. Formations within the Edwards Group include the Kainier Formation and the Person Formation. The Upper Cretaceous rock units confine the Edwards Aquifer within the group.

The Mount Bonnell fault has a vertical throw of up to 600 feet, making it the most prominent normal fault within the Balcones Fault Zone. During the Miocene, the Edwards Group was displaced downwards relative to the Glen Rose Formation on the Edwards Plateau, so that they are juxtaposed.

<doc id="1238173" wikidata="Q3997736" url="?curid=1238173" title="Weyl transformation">
<text>In theoretical physics, the Weyl transformation, named after German mathematician Hermann Weyl, is a local rescaling of the metric tensor:

formula_1

which produces another metric in the same conformal class. A theory or an expression invariant under this transformation is called conformally invariant, or is said to possess Weyl invariance or Weyl symmetry. The Weyl symmetry is an important symmetry in conformal field theory. It is, for example, a symmetry of the Polyakov action. When quantum mechanical effects break the conformal invariance of a theory, it is said to exhibit a conformal anomaly or Weyl anomaly.

The ordinary Levi-Civita connection and associated spin connections are not invariant under Weyl transformations. Weyl connections are a class of affine connections that is invariant, although no Weyl connection is individual invariant under Weyl transformations.

==Conformal weight==
A quantity formula_2 has conformal weight formula_3 if, under the Weyl transformation, it transforms via 

:formula_4

Thus conformally weighted quantities belong to certain density bundles; see also conformal dimension. Let formula_5 be the connection one-form associated to the Levi-Civita connection of formula_6. Introduce a connection that depends also on an initial one-form formula_7 via

:formula_8

Then formula_9 is covariant and has conformal weight formula_10.

==Formulas==
For the transformation
:formula_11 
We can derive the following formulas
:formula_12
Note that the Weyl tensor is invariant under a Weyl rescaling.

<doc id="1238181" wikidata="Q1048428" url="?curid=1238181" title="Blueschist">
<text>Blueschist (), also called glaucophane schist, is a metavolcanic rock that forms by the metamorphism of basalt and rocks with similar composition at high pressures and low temperatures (), approximately corresponding to a depth of . The blue color of the rock comes from the presence of the predominant minerals glaucophane and lawsonite.

Blueschists are schists typically found within orogenic belts as terranes of lithology in faulted contact with greenschist or rarely eclogite facies rocks.

==Petrology==
Blueschist, as a rock type, is defined by the presence of the minerals glaucophane + ( lawsonite or epidote ) +/- jadeite +/- albite or chlorite +/- garnet +/- muscovite in a rock of roughly basaltic composition.&lt;br&gt;
Blueschist often has a lepidoblastic, nematoblastic or schistose rock microstructure defined primarily by chlorite, phengitic white mica, glaucophane, and other minerals with an elongate or platy shape. 

Grain size is rarely coarse, as mineral growth is retarded by the swiftness of the rock&#x27;s metamorphic trajectory and perhaps more importantly, the low temperatures of metamorphism and in many cases the anhydrous state of the basalts. However, porphyritic varieties do occur. Blueschists may appear blue, black, gray, or blue-green in outcrop.

==Blueschist facies==
Blueschist facies is determined by the particular temperature and pressure conditions required to metamorphose basalt to form blueschist. Felsic rocks and pelitic sediments which are subjected to blueschist facies conditions will form different mineral assemblages than metamorphosed basalt. Thereby, these rocks do not appear blue overall in color.

Blueschist mineralogy varies by rock composition, but the classic equilibrium assemblages of blueschist facies are:

* Basalts: &quot;glaucophane + lawsonite and/or epidote + albite + titanite +/- garnet +/- quartz&quot; &quot;jadeite + quartz&quot; - diagnostic of pressures ~&gt; 10 kbar
* Ultramafic rocks: &quot;serpentinite/lizardite +/- talc +/- zoisite&quot;
* Pelites: &quot;Fe-Mg-carpholite +/- chloritoid +/- kyanite + zoisite +/- pargasite or phengite +/- albite +/- quartz +/- talc +/- garnet&quot;
* Granites: &quot;kyanite +/- paragonite +/- chlorite +/- albite +/- quartz +/- pargasite or phengite&quot;
* Calc-silicates: Various
* Limestones and marble: calcite transforms to aragonite at high pressure, but typically reverts to calcite when exhumed

Blueschist facies generally is considered to form under pressures of &gt;0.6 GPa, equivalent to depth of burial in excess of 15–18 km, and at temperatures of between 200 and 500 °C. This is a &#x27;low temperature, high pressure&#x27; prograde metamorphic path and is also known as the &quot;Franciscan facies series&quot;, after the west coast of the United States where these rocks are exposed. Well-exposed blueschists also occur in Greece, Turkey, Japan, New Zealand and New Caledonia.

Continued subduction of blueschist facies oceanic crust will produce eclogite facies assemblages in metamorphosed basalt (garnet + omphacitic clinopyroxene). Rocks which have been subjected to blueschist conditions during a prograde trajectory will gain heat by conduction with hotter lower crustal rocks if they remain at the 15–18 km depth. Blueschist which heats up to greater than 500 °C via this fashion will enter greenschist or eclogite facies temperature-pressure conditions, and the mineral assemblages will metamorphose to reflect the new facies conditions. 

Thus in order for blueschist facies assemblages to be seen at the Earth&#x27;s surface, the rock must be exhumed swiftly enough to prevent total thermal equilibration of the rocks which are under blueschist facies conditions with the typical geothermal gradient. 

Blueschists and other high-pressure subduction zone rocks are thought to be exhumed rapidly by flow and/or faulting in accretionary wedges or the upper parts of subducted crust, or may return to the Earth&#x27;s surface in part owing to buoyancy if the metabasaltic rocks are associated with low-density continental crust (marble, metapelite, and other rocks of continental margins).

It has been held that the absence of blueschist dating to before the Neoproterozoic Era indicates that currently exhumed rocks never reached blueschist facies at subduction zones before 1,000 million years ago. This assertion is arguably wrong because the earliest oceanic crust would have contained more magnesium than today&#x27;s crust and, therefore, would have formed greenschist-like rocks at blueschist facies.

==History and etymology==

In Minoan Crete blueschist and greenschist were used to pave streets and courtyards between 1650 and 1600 BC. These rocks were likely quarried in Agia Pelagia on the north coast of central Crete.

In 1962, Edgar Bailey of the U.S. Geological Survey, introduced the concept of &quot;blueschist&quot; into the subject of metamorphic geology. His carefully constructed definition established the pressure and temperature conditions which produce this type of metamorphism.

<text>Northern Transylvania (, ) was the region of the Kingdom of Romania that during World War II, as a consequence of the August 1940 territorial agreement known as the Second Vienna Award, became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. With an area of , the population was largely composed of both ethnic Romanians and Hungarians. 

In October 1944, Soviet and Romanian forces gained control of the territory, and by March 1945 Northern Transylvania returned to Romanian administration. After the war, this was confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947.

==Background==

The region has a varied history. It was once the nucleus of the Kingdom of Dacia (82 BC–106 AD). In 106 AD, the Roman Empire conquered the territory, systematically exploiting its resources. After the Roman legions withdrew in 271 AD, it was overrun by a succession of various tribes, bringing it under the control of the Carpi, Visigoths, Huns, Gepids, Avars, and Slavs. During the 9th century, Transylvania came under the rule of the First Bulgarian Empire.

The Magyars conquered much of Central Europe at the end of the 9th century and for almost six hundred years, Transylvania was a voivodeship in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and the Hungarian defeat by the Ottomans, Transylvania became a semi-independent principality under the rule of the local Hungarian nobility, but owing suzerainty to the Ottoman Empire. It then became a province of the Habsburg monarchy as the Lands of the Hungarian Crown, and after 1848, and again from 1867 to 1918 it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The dual monarchy dissolved after World War I.

The ethnic Romanians, who formed the majority population of Transylvania, elected representatives who proclaimed the Union with Romania on 1 December 1918. The Proclamation of Union at Alba Iulia was adopted by the Deputies of the Romanians from Transylvania during the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia, supported one month later by the vote of the Deputies of the Transylvanian Saxons during the Mediaș Assembly. By spring 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War, Transylvania came under administrative control of Romania. Eventually in June 1920 the Treaty of Trianon assigned Transylvania to the Kingdom of Romania.

=== The text of the Second Vienna Award ===
# &quot; The final route of the border line, which separates Romania from Hungary, will correspond to the one marked on the geographical map attached here. A Romanian-Hungarian commission will determine the details of the route on the spot.&quot;
# &quot; The Romanian territory assigned to Hungary will be evacuated by Romanian troops within 15 days and handed over in good order. The different phases of the evacuation and the occupation, as well as their modalities will be fixed within a Romanian-Hungarian commission. The Hungarian and Romanian governments will ensure that the evacuation and occupation are carried out in full order. &quot;
# &quot; All Romanian subjects, settled on this day on the territory to be ceded by Romania, acquire Hungarian nationality without any formalities. They will be allowed to opt in favor of the Romanian nationality within 6 months. Those people who will exercise this right, will leave the Hungarian territory within an additional period of 1 year and will be allowed to move into Romania. They will be able to take, without any hindrance, their movable property, to liquidate their immovable property, until the moment of their departure, and to take with them the resulting product. If the liquidation fails, these people will be compensated by Hungary. Hungary will resolve all issues related to the transplantation of optants in a broad and accommodating manner. &quot;
# &quot; Romanian subjects of Hungarian race, established in the territory ceded in 1919 by Hungary to Romania and which remained under the sovereignty of the state, receive the right to opt for Hungarian nationality, within a period of 6 months. The principles set out in paragraph 3 shall also apply to people exercising this right.&quot;
# &quot; The Hungarian government solemnly undertakes to fully assimilate the Romanian people with other Hungarian subjects, who, on the basis of the above arbitration, will acquire Hungarian nationality. On the other hand, the Romanian government takes the same solemn commitment regarding its Hungarian subjects, who will remain on the Romanian territory. &quot;
# &quot; The details resulting from the transfer of sovereignty will be regulated by a direct agreement between the Romanian and Hungarian governments. &quot;
# &quot; Should any difficulties or doubts arise during the application of this arbitration, the Romanian and Hungarian governments will seek to reach an agreement directly. If no agreement is reached, the dispute will be submitted to the governments of the Reich and Italy, which will adopt a final solution.&quot;

==Second Vienna Award==


In June 1940, Romania was forced (as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) to submit to a Soviet ultimatum and accept the annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Subsequently, Hungary attempted to regain Transylvania, which it had lost in the immediate aftermath of World War I. Germany and Italy pressured both Hungary and Romania to resolve the situation in a bilateral agreement. The two delegations met in Turnu Severin on 16 August, but the negotiations failed due to a demand for a territory from the Hungarian side and only an offer of population exchange from the Romanian side. To impede a Hungarian-Romanian war in their &quot;hinterland&quot;, the Axis powers pressured both governments to accept their arbitration: the Second Vienna Award, signed on 30 August 1940.

Historian Keith Hitchins summarizes the situation created by the award:
:&quot;Far from settling matters, the Vienna Award had exacerbated relations between Romania and Hungary. It did not solve the nationality problem by separating all Magyars from all Romanians. Some 1,150,000 to 1,300,000 Romanians, or 48 percent to over 50 percent of the population of the ceded territory, depending upon whose statistics are used, remained north of the new frontier, while about 500,000 Magyars (other Hungarian estimates go as high as 800,000, Romanian as low as 363,000) continued to reside in the south.&quot;
The Hungarian population was in the unusual situation of being an overwhelming majority in an area of southeastern Transylvania, deep within Romania and far from the Hungarian border (the area, known as Székely Land, is today mainly in Harghita, Covasna, and Mureș counties), and not simply only in certain areas next to the Hungarian border (as in the case of Czechoslovakia and Bačka or Baranya). The solution decided upon was to gouge a claw-shaped corridor through northwestern Romania, including a large Romanian-populated area, in order to incorporate this Hungarian-majority area within Hungary.

Population of Northern Transylvania, as per 1930 Romanian census:
According to Romanian estimates of the region before the arbitration in 1940, there were 1,304,903 Romanians (50.2%) and 978,074 (37.1%) Hungarians. One year later, the Hungarian census counted the population as 53.5% Hungarians and 39.1% Romanians.

The dissimilar ratios were caused by a combination of complex factors such as migration, the assimilation of Jews, and bilingual speakers. According to Hungarian registrations, 100,000 Hungarian refugees had arrived in Hungary from South Transylvania by January 1941. By then, there were a total of 109,532 Romanian refugees from Northern Transylvania. A fall in the total population suggests that a further 40,000 to 50,000 Romanians moved from North Transylvania to South Transylvania, including refugees who were omitted from the official registration for various reasons. Additionally, Hungarian gains by assimilation were balanced by losses for other groups of native speakers, such as Jews. In the counties of Máramaros and Szatmár, dozens of settlements had many people who had declared themselves as Romanian but now identified themselves as Hungarian, although they had not spoken any Hungarian even in 1910.

==Massacres==
After the occupation of Northern Transylvania in the autumn of 1940, the Romanian population was targeted for reprisal actions by Hungarian nationalists. Military abuses, illegal arrests, torture, lynchings, summary executions, and the aggressive arrogance of the representatives of the new administrative structures occurred.

=== Romanian statistics on abuses committed by Hungarian authorities ===
In a statistical report of the State Secretariat for Nationalities, from Bucharest, on the situation in Northern Transylvania from 30 August 1940 to 1 November 1941, 919 murders, 1,126 maimings, 4,126 beatings, 15,893 arrests, 124 desecrations, 78 and 447 collective and individual devastations are mentioned. A few days after the installation, the occupation authorities started deporting the Romanians to the camps. According to a report by the camp commander in the town of Püspökladány, it turns out that 1,315 Romanians were interned in that camp alone in September 1940, well above its maximum capacity. Consequently, that same month, other camps were established at Someșeni and Florești, near Cluj.

There were also mass expulsions of ethnic Romanians across the new border imposed by the Second Vienna Award, especially of those considered dangerous or presumably hostile to the new regime. Beginning in 1940, the expulsions were practiced until 1944, when, in September and October, the Hungarian authorities were expelled by the Soviet and Romanian military units. Until 1 January 1941, there were a total of 109,532 Romanian refugees, of which 11,957 were Transylvanians expelled by the Hungarian authorities (including cases of ethnic Hungarians not recognized as Hungarians).

A statistical covering the period from 1 September 1940 to 1 December 1943 indicates a total of 218,919 expelled persons. This included numerous refugees who left their localities of residence out of fear of the new Hungarian administration. On 23 August 1944, when King Michael&#x27;s Coup turned Romania against the Axis and the struggle for the liberation of Northern Transylvania began, there were over 500,000 people from the ceded territory based on the Second Vienna Award in Romania. 

During this period, Romanian schools and churches also suffered. On the territory of the ceded part of Transylvania, there were (on 30 August 1940) 1,666 Romanian-language elementary schools and 67 high school, vocational and higher education units. At the beginning of the 1941/1942 school year, the number of primary schools decreased by 792 units, and in 1940/1941 there was only one high school with Romanian as the language of instruction – the one in Năsăud – and only &quot;seven&quot; Romanian sections within high schools with another language of instruction.

=== The reactions of the Hungarians to the atrocities committed under the Hungarian occupation ===
However, in a few cases, there were also Hungarian locals who were involved in rescuing Romanian families. Among them is the case of Iosif Gáll, who saved several Romanians from death during the Treznea Massacre. A testimony in this regard is that of Gavril Butcovan, one of the survivors of the drama in Ip commune, Sălaj:

There were cases in which Hungarian locals fell victim trying to help the Romanians. Among them was the maid Sarolta Juhász from Mureșenii de Câmpie, who was killed along with the entire family of the town&#x27;s Romanian priest Bujor while trying to protect them from the Hungarian army.

==Hungarian rule==
Hungary held Northern Transylvania from September 1940 to October 1944. In 1940, ethnic disturbances between Hungarians and Romanians continued after some incidents following the entrance of the Hungarian Army, culminating in massacres at Treznea and Ip in the first two weeks approximately 1000 Romanians perished.

On 5 September 1940, five days after the Second Vienna Award, the first Hungarian military unit crossed the border at Sighetul Marmației. Two Hungarian armies entered the territory of annexed Transylvania: the first army (with a force of 208,000 soldiers) operated in the northeastern part of Transylvania, while the second army (with a staff of 102,000 soldiers) operated in the Oradea-Cluj area.

On the first day, the main occupied cities were Carei, Satu Mare, Sighetul Marmației, and Ocna Șugatag. Nine stages of progress were established, each over a distance of 40-80 kilometers. The last localities taken over, on 13 September 1940, were Sfântu Gheorghe and Târgu Secuiesc. The advance of Hungarian units took place in peaceful conditions, with only a few scattered incidents with Romanian soldiers retreating to southern Transylvania. The Hungarian army was greeted enthusiastically by the majority of the Hungarian population, which was documented in detail in the 1940 films, with the parade of military units, as well as Horthy riding on a gray horse, marching through the main cities of Northern Transylvania.

After some ethnic Hungarian groups considered unreliable or insecure were sacked/expelled from Southern Transylvania, the Hungarian officials also regularly expelled some Romanian groups from Northern Transylvania. Many Hungarians and Romanians either fled or chose to opt between the two countries. There was a mass exodus; over 100,000 people on both sides of the ethnic and political borders relocated. This continued until 1944.

Following the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany on 19 March 1944, Northern Transylvania came under German military occupation. Like the Jews living in Hungary, most of the Jews in Northern Transylvania (about 150,000) were sent to concentration camps during World War II, a move that was facilitated by local military and civilians. Following several decrees of the Hungarian government and high-level consultations at a meeting on 26 April with László Endre in Szatmárnémeti (now Satu Mare), the deportation of the Jews was decided. On 3 May, authorities in Dés (now Dej) launched the action of ghettoization of Jews in the Bungăr forest, where 3,700 Jews from Dej and 4,100 Jews from other localities in the area were imprisoned. During the operation of the Dej ghetto, Jews were mistreated, tortured, and starved. The deportation of the Jews to the Nazi death camps was done with freight wagons, in three stages: the first transport on 28 May (when 3,150 Jews were deported), the second on 6 June (when 3,360 Jews were deported), and the third on 8 June (when the last 1,364 Jews were deported). Most of those deported were exterminated in the Auschwitz–Birkenau camp, with just over 800 deportees surviving. The Kolozsvár Ghetto (in what is now Cluj-Napoca) was initiated on 3 May, and was put under the command of László Urbán, the local police chief. The ghetto, comprising about 18,000 Jews, was liquidated in six transports to Auschwitz, with the first deportation occurring on 25 May, and the last one on 9 June. Other ghettoes that were set up in Northern Transylvania during this period were the Oradea ghetto (the largest one, with 35,000 Jews), the Baia Mare ghetto, the Bistrița ghetto, the Cehei ghetto, the Reghin ghetto, the Satu Mare ghetto, and the Sfântu Gheorghe ghetto.

After King Michael&#x27;s Coup of 23 August 1944, Romania left the Axis and joined the Allies. Thus, the Romanian Army fought Nazi Germany and its allies in Romania – regaining Northern Transylvania – and further on, in German occupied Hungary and in Slovakia and Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, for instance, in the Budapest Offensive, the Siege of Budapest, and the Prague Offensive.

The Second Vienna Award was voided by the Allied Commission through the Armistice Agreement with Romania (12 September 1944) whose Article 19 stipulated the following: &quot;The Allied Governments regard the decision of the Vienna award regarding Transylvania as null and void and are agreed that Transylvania (or the greater part thereof) should be returned to Romania, subject to confirmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Romania against Germany and Hungary.&quot;
The territory was occupied by the Allied forces by late October 1944. On 25 October, at the Battle of Carei, units of the Romanian 4th Army under the command of General Gheorghe Avramescu defeated the last remaining Hungarian and German troops in the area and took control of the last piece of the territory ceded in 1940 to Hungary. However, due to the activities of Romanian paramilitary forces, the Soviets expelled the Romanian administration from Northern Transylvania in November 1944 and did not allow them to return until 10 March 1945.

On 20 January 1945, Hungary accepted the obligation to evacuate all Hungarian troops and officials from the territory, to retreat to its pre-war borders, and to repeal all legislative and administrative regulations in connection with the incorporation of the territory.

The 1947 Paris Peace Treaty reaffirmed the borders between Romania and Hungary, as originally defined in the Treaty of Trianon, 27 years earlier, thus confirming the return of Northern Transylvania to Romania.

==Geography==

Northern Transylvania is a diverse region, both in terms of landscape and population. It contains both largely rural areas (such as Bistrița-Năsăud County) as well as major cities, such as Cluj-Napoca, Oradea, Târgu Mureș, Baia Mare, and Satu Mare. Centers of Hungarian culture, such as Miercurea Ciuc and Sfântu Gheorghe, are also part of the region. An important tourist destination is Maramureș County, an area known for its beautiful rural scenery, local small woodwork, including wooden churches, its craftwork industry, and its original rural architecture.

<doc id="1238187" wikidata="Q2849011" url="?curid=1238187" title="Andrés Caicedo">
<text>Luis Andrés Caicedo Estela (29 September 1951 – 4 March 1977) was a Colombian writer born in Cali, the city where he would spend most of his life. Despite his premature death, his works are considered to be some of the most original produced in Colombia. Caicedo led different cultural movements in the city like the literary group &quot;&quot;Los Dialogantes&quot; (Those who speak), the Cinema Club of Cali and the &quot;Ojo al Cine&quot; Magazine (Attention to the Cinema). In 1970, he won the First Literary Contest of Caracas with his work &quot;Los dientes de caperucita&quot; (The Teeth of Little Red Riding Hood) that opened the doors of national recognition for him. Some sources say that he used to say that to live more than 25 years was a shame and it is seen as the main reason of his suicide on March 4, 1977, when he was that age.

Caicedo&#x27;s work has as its context the urban world and its social conflicts, especially those of young people. Contrary to the school of magic realism, the work of Caicedo is grounded completely in social reality. Therefore, some scholars give importance to his work as an alternative in Latin America to prominent figures such as Gabriel García Márquez, especially through the research of the Chilean journalist, writer and movie critic Alberto Fuguet who called Caicedo &quot;The first enemy of Macondo&quot;&quot;. Despite his fame in Colombia, Caicedo is little known in Latin America, maybe for his early death. However his work is becoming known thanks to the influence of his works in new writer generations such as Rafael Chaparro, Efraim Medina Reyes, Manuel Giraldo, Octavio Escobar and Ricardo Abdahllah.

== Biography ==

=== First years ===
Andrés Caicedo was the youngest surviving child and only surviving son of Carlos Alberto Caicedo and Nellie Estella. His brother Francisco José was born in 1958, but died three years later. By that time Andrés was studying in &quot;Colegio del Pilar&quot;, after he was in &quot;Colegio Pio XII&quot;, a &quot;&quot;very bad Franciscan establishment&quot; as he said years after. Because of his bad behavior in the school in Cali, he was transferred to the Colegio Calasanz in Medellín in 1964 and this was the year of his first story: &quot;El Silencio&quot; (The Silence). However, his academic and discipline was rather the same, a reason to be transferred again to Cali, this time to Colegio Berchmans, an institution that would influence his works. From Berchmans he was expelled to go to Colegio San Luis in 1966, again expelled and finally he could finish his high school in Colegio Camacho Perea in 1968.

=== Among pages, stages and cinema ===
Along with his passion for literature, Caicedo liked cinema and stage. In 1966, he wrote his first play, &quot;Las curiosas conciencias&quot; (Curious Minds) and his first story, &quot;Infection&quot;. A year later he directed the play &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; by Eugène Ionesco and he wrote &quot;The End of the Vacations&quot;, &quot;Welcoming the New Student&quot;, &quot;The Sea&quot;, &quot;The Imbeciles are also Witnesses&quot; and &quot;The Skin of the Other Hero&quot;. His last work would make him win the First Students&#x27; Theatre Festival of the Theatre Department of University of Valle. He abandoned the university in 1971 to join the Cali Theatre Company (Teatro Experimental de Cali) as an actor, and there he met the famous Colombian director Enrique Buenaventura.

In 1969, he also started to write cinema reviews for newspapers, for example in the Cali newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, in &quot;Occidente&quot; and &quot;El Pueblo&quot;. He got another award with his story &quot;Berenice&quot; in the Story Contest of the University of Valle, while his story &quot;The Teeth of Little Red Riding Hood&quot; won the second place of the Latin American Story Contest organized by the Caracas Image Magazine. He adapted and directed the work of Eugène Ionesco: &quot;The Chairs&quot;. He wrote the story &quot;For this reason I am back to my city&quot;, &quot;Empty&quot;, &quot;The Messengers&quot;, &quot;Besacalles&quot;, &quot;From Up to Down, From Left to Right&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Happy Friendships&quot; and &quot;Lulita, that you do not want to open the door?&quot;.

=== The Cinema Club of Cali ===

His love for cinema was the motive for opening the Cinema Club of Cali with his friends Ramiro Arbeláez, Hernando Guerrero and Luis Ospina in 1969. It started its meetings in the headquarters of the Company of Theatre of Cali (&quot;Teatro Experimental de Cali&quot;), but later moved to the Alameda Cinema and finally to the San Fernando Cinema. The Cinema Club attracted many students, intellectuals and critics who used to watch the movies and meet afterwards to discuss and analyze the films with Caicedo.

In 1970. he adapted and directed &quot;The Night of the Assassins&quot; of José Triana and in that same year he wrote a new story, &quot;Antígona&quot;. In 1971, he wrote stories like &quot;Patricialinda&quot;, &quot;Cannibalism&quot;, &quot;Fatal Little Destinies&quot;, &quot;Angelita and Miguel Ángel&quot; and &quot;El atravesado&quot;. He wrote also some essays: &quot;The Heroes of the Beginning&quot;, an essay about the work of Mario Vargas Llosa, &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot; and &quot;The Sea&quot;, an essay on the work of Harold Pinter.

His friend Carlos Mayolo tried unsuccessfully to bring to cinema his screenplay &quot;Angelita and Miguel Angel&quot; in 1972. In that year he wrote the screenplay &quot;A Good Man is Very Difficult to Find&quot; and the stories &quot;The Suitor&quot; and &quot;The Time of the Swamp&quot;, which was awarded by the National Contents of Story of the Universidad Externado de Colombia.

=== Looking for Hollywood ===

In 1973, Caicedo went to Los Angeles and New York. He knew sufficient English and had dreamed of meeting the legendary Roger Corman in order to sell to him four of his play scripts that his sister had translated into English. He had come thinking that Hollywood would welcome him with open hands. However, the venture was unsuccessful and Corman never got ahold of his books. About Hollywood he said:

As nobody in Hollywood paid attention to the &quot;writer with the face of a rockstar&quot; in the 1960s, Caicedo dedicated himself to watching movies, studying blues and rock, especially the Rolling Stones and writing a new story, ¡Que viva la música!, a work that was to become the most internationally recognized title of Caicedo so far. He also began work on &quot;Memories of a Cinema Lover&quot;, a diary he intended to make into a novel. However, he could have an interview with Sergio Leone and returned to Colombia.

=== Last years ===

Caicedo considered that his best work was &quot;Maternity&quot;, a story written in 1974. In that year, he also published &quot;&quot;Ojo al cine&quot; (Attention to the Cinema), which would become one of the most important magazines on the topic in Colombia. He returned to the U.S., but this time to participate in the International Exposition of Cinema and a year later the publishing house &quot;Pirata de Calidad&quot; published his story &quot;El Atravesado&quot; thanks to the economic support of his mother, and his national recognition.

=== Suicide ===

Caicedo had mentioned that to live past the age of 25 was madness and he died by suicide at age 25 on March 4, 1977. On the afternoon he died, he received a volume of his recently published book &quot;Que viva la música!&quot;. He took 60 pills of secobarbital. Analyzing his death, Alberto Fuguet says:

== Influence ==

The first Colombian author to evince Caicedo&#x27;s influence may be Manuel Giraldo Magil from the city of Ibagué, in his work &quot;Concerts of Bewilderment&quot; (&quot;Conciertos del desconcierto&quot;). In the 1990s, the work of Rafael Chaparro Madiedo, &quot;Opio en las nubes&quot; (Opium in the Clouds), was viewed as a &quot;Caicedian&quot; piece of work. Other authors like Octavio Escobar Giraldo, Efraím Medina, and Ricardo Abdahllah are related to what is becoming a real literary school. The Theatre Company of the city of Medellín, Matacandelas, has played &quot;Angelitos empantanados&quot; for over a decade.

== Works ==

Most of Caicedo&#x27;s works were published after his death, thanks to the commitment of some of his friends. The works include in stories, playwrights for stage and cinema, and essays. Some of his personal letters to his mother, sisters and friends, were also published. The importance of the letters is that they show the turbulence of his soul.

<text>In tetrapods, cervical vertebrae (: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull. Truncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals) lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. In sauropsid species, the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. In lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. Most mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine. 

In humans, cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery, vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. The remainder of this article focuses upon human anatomy.

==Structure==

By convention, the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull and higher numbered vertebrae (C2–C7) proceeding away from the skull and down the spine.
The general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical vertebrae are described here. The first, second, and seventh vertebrae are extraordinary, and are detailed later.
* The bodies of these four vertebrae are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.
** The &quot;anterior&quot; and &quot;posterior surfaces&quot; are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward, so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.
** The &quot;upper surface&quot; is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.
** The &quot;lower surface&quot; is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips of the underlying vertebra.
* The pedicles are directed laterally and backward, and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time, narrower.
* The laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral foramen is large and of a triangular form.
* The spinous process is short and bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. Because the spinous processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae; the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2–C7 and to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.
* The superior and inferior articular processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle and lamina.
* The articular facets are flat and of an oval form:
** the &quot;superior&quot; face backward, upward, and slightly medially.
** the &quot;inferior&quot; face forward, downward, and slightly laterally.
* The transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. Each process consists of an anterior and a posterior part. These two parts are joined, outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.
** The anterior portion is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the &quot;costal process&quot; or &quot;costal element&quot;. It arises from the side of the body, is directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior tubercle.
** The posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.

The anterior tubercle of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac tubercle (for Édouard Chassaignac). This separates the carotid artery from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. The carotid tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and cervical plexus.

The cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical vertebrae. For example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.

===Atlas and axis===
The atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.

The atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting the skull and spine. It lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs either superior or inferior to it. It is ring-like and consists of an anterior arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.

The axis (C2) forms the pivot on which the atlas rotates. The most distinctive characteristic of this bone is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body and articulates with C1. The body is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra.

===Vertebra prominens===

The vertebra prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which is palpable from the skin surface. Sometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops from the anterior root of the transverse process. These ribs are usually small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome. Very rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.

The long spinous process of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. It is not bifurcated, and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. This process is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about 70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.

The transverse processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent, while the anterior are small and faintly marked. The upper surface of each usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation.

The transverse foramen may be as large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.

On the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently, the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through the foramen.

==Function==

The movement of nodding the head takes place predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between the atlas and the occipital bone. However, the cervical spine is comparatively mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of the vertebral column itself. This movement between the atlas and occipital bone is often referred to as the &quot;yes joint&quot;, owing to its nature of being able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.

The movement of shaking or rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. A small amount of rotation of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. This movement between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the &quot;no joint&quot;, owing to its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.

==Clinical significance==
Cervical degenerative changes arise from conditions such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes. The changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from 0–4 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).

Injuries to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae, but neurological injury is uncommon. C4 and C5 are the areas that see the highest amount of cervical spine trauma.

If it does occur, however, it may cause death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm, which leads to respiratory failure.

Common patterns of injury include the odontoid fracture and the hangman&#x27;s fracture, both of which are often treated with immobilization in a cervical collar or halo brace.

A common practice is to immobilize a patient&#x27;s cervical spine to prevent further damage during transport to hospital. This practice has come under review recently as incidence rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients. In clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.

===Landmarks===

The vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy. This includes:
* At C1, base of the nose and the hard palate
* At C2, the teeth of a closed mouth
* At C3, the mandible and hyoid bone
* At C4, the common carotid artery bifurcates.
* From C4–5, the thyroid cartilage
* From C6–7, the cricoid cartilage
* At C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. It is also the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process of the C6 vertebrae.

<text>The third USS &quot;Lawrence&quot; (DD-8) was a &quot;Lawrence&quot;-class destroyer, which was a sub-class of , in the United States Navy. She was named for Captain James Lawrence.

==Construction==
&quot;Lawrence&quot; was laid down on 10 April 1899, by Fore River Ship &amp; Engine Company, Weymouth, Massachusetts; launched on 7 November 1900; sponsored by Miss Ruth Lawrence, great niece of Captain Lawrence; and commissioned on 7 April 1903.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
Assigned to the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla, &quot;Lawrence&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast, taking part in the fleet search problem off the New England coast during the summer of 1903. The torpedo boat departed Norfolk on 17 December, and sailed to Key West for winter exercises. On 31 December 1903 while at anchor at Key West she was fouled by the passing steamer , receiving minor hull damage.

During 1904, she performed Midshipmen cruises and acted as a torpedo practice ship. She continued exercises in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic coast until she decommissioned at Philadelphia on 14 November 1906.

&quot;Lawrence&quot; recommissioned on 23 July 1907 and resumed training operations out of Norfolk. Departing Hampton Roads on 2 December, she sailed with the torpedo flotilla for winter maneuvers in the Caribbean and off South America. She arrived at San Diego on 28 April 1908 and stood out San Francisco eight days later as the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; steamed into San Francisco Bay. During the next four years, she operated in the Pacific with the 3rd Torpedo Flotilla patrolling the coast from Canada to Panama and engaged in exercises with the fleet. From 1 June 1912 – 23 April 1914, &quot;Lawrence&quot; was in commission in reserve.

Returned to full commission status, she departed San Francisco on 25 April to patrol the Mexican coast and protect American and foreign nationals during the Mexican revolution. Returning to Mare Island on 12 September, the destroyer was once again placed in reserve status.

===World War I===
After America&#x27;s entry into World War I, &quot;Lawrence&quot; was placed in full commission on 13 June 1917 to join coastal defense units. Arriving Balboa, Panama, on 29 July, she guarded the ocean approaches to the Panama Canal Zone until on 30 May 1918, when she steamed toward Key West. Upon her arrival there she operated as coastal escort and patrol ship. After the Armistice, &quot;Lawrence&quot; steamed to Philadelphia, arriving there on 1 February 1919. She decommissioned on 20 June and was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia on 3 January 1920.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant Thomas C. Hart (9 December 1905 – 14 November 1906) (Later Admiral) 
* Lieutenant Alfred Graham Howe (1 June 1908 – 27 July 1909) (Later Rear Admiral) 
* Lieutenant Daniel E. Barbey (December 1917-7 July 1919) (Later Vice admiral)

<doc id="1238210" wikidata="Q408053" url="?curid=1238210" title="Enol">
<text>In organic chemistry, enols are a type of functional group or intermediate in organic chemistry containing a group with the formula (R = many substituents). The term &quot;enol&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;alkenol&quot;, a portmanteau deriving from &quot;-ene&quot;/&quot;alkene&quot; and the &quot;-ol&quot;. Many kinds of enols are known.

Keto–enol tautomerism refers to a chemical equilibrium between a &quot;keto&quot; form (a carbonyl, named for the common ketone case) and an enol. The interconversion of the two forms involves the transfer of an alpha hydrogen atom and the reorganisation of bonding electrons. The keto and enol forms are tautomers of each other.

==Enolization==
Organic esters, ketones, and aldehydes with an α-hydrogen ( bond adjacent to the carbonyl group) often form enols. The reaction involves migration of a proton () from carbon to oxygen:
In the case of ketones, the conversion is called a keto-enol tautomerism, although this name is often more generally applied to all such tautomerizations. Usually the equilibrium constant is so small that the enol is undetectable spectroscopically.

In some compounds with two (or more) carbonyls, the enol form becomes dominant. The behavior of 2,4-pentanedione illustrates this effect:

Enols are derivatives of vinyl alcohol, with a connectivity. Deprotonation of organic carbonyls gives the enolate anion, which are a strong nucleophile. A classic example for favoring the keto form can be seen in the equilibrium between vinyl alcohol and acetaldehyde (K = [enol]/[keto] ≈ 3). In 1,3-diketones, such as acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione), the enol form is more favored.

The acid-catalyzed conversion of an enol to the keto form proceeds by proton transfer from O to carbon. The process does not occur intramolecularly, but requires participation of solvent or other mediators.

==Stereochemistry of ketonization==
If R1 and R2 (note equation at top of page) are different substituents, there is a new stereocenter formed at the alpha position when an enol converts to its keto form. Depending on the nature of the three R groups, the resulting products in this situation would be diastereomers or enantiomers.

== Enediols ==
Enediols are alkenes with a hydroxyl group on each carbon of the C=C double bond. Normally such compounds are disfavored components in equilibria with acyloins. One special case is catechol, where the C=C subunit is part of an aromatic ring. In some other cases however, enediols are stabilized by flanking carbonyl groups. These stabilized enediols are called reductones. Such species are important in glycochemistry, e.g., the Lobry de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation.

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is a key substrate in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. In the Calvin cycle, the ribulose equilibrates with the enediol, which then binds carbon dioxide. The same enediol is also susceptible to attack by oxygen (O2) in the (undesirable) process called photorespiration.
==Phenols==
Phenols represent a kind of enol. For some phenols and related compounds, the keto tautomer plays an important role. Many of the reactions of resorcinol involve the keto tautomer, for example. Naphthalene-1,4-diol exists in observable equilibrium with the diketone tetrahydronaphthalene-1,4-dione.

==Biochemistry==
Keto–enol tautomerism is important in several areas of biochemistry.

The high phosphate-transfer potential of phosphoenolpyruvate results from the fact that the phosphorylated compound is &quot;trapped&quot; in the less thermodynamically favorable enol form, whereas after dephosphorylation it can assume the keto form.

The enzyme enolase catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phosphoglyceric acid to the enol phosphate ester. Metabolism of PEP to pyruvic acid by pyruvate kinase (PK) generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via substrate-level phosphorylation.

==Reactivity==
===Addition of electrophiles===
The terminus of the double bond in enols is nucleophilic. Its reactions with electrophilic organic compounds is important in biochemistry as well as synthetic organic chemistry. In the former area, the fixation of carbon dioxide involves addition of CO2 to an enol.

===Deprotonation: enolates===

Deprotonation of enolizable ketones, aldehydes, and esters gives enolates. Enolates can be trapped by the addition of electrophiles at oxygen. Silylation gives silyl enol ether. Acylation gives
esters such as vinyl acetate.

== Stable enols ==
In general, enols are less stable than their keto equivalents because of the favorability of the C=O double bond over C=C double bond. However, enols can be stabilized kinetically or thermodynamically.

Some enols are sufficiently stabilized kinetically so that they can be characterized.
Delocalization can stabilize the enol tautomer. Thus, very stable enols are phenols. Another stabilizing factor in 1,3-dicarbonyls is intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Both of these factors influence the enol-dione equilibrium in acetylacetone.

<doc id="1238224" wikidata="Q728375" url="?curid=1238224" title="Marcantonio Raimondi">
<text>Marcantonio Raimondi, often called simply Marcantonio ( – ), was an Italian engraver, known for being the first important printmaker whose body of work consists largely of prints copying paintings. He is therefore a key figure in the rise of the reproductive print. He also systematized a technique of engraving that became dominant in Italy and elsewhere. His collaboration with Raphael greatly helped his career, and he continued to exploit Raphael&#x27;s works after the painter&#x27;s death in 1520, playing a large part in spreading High Renaissance styles across Europe. Much of the biographical information we have comes from his life, the only one of a printmaker, in Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;.
He is attributed with around 300 engravings. After years of great success, his career ran into trouble in the mid-1520s; he was imprisoned for a time in Rome over his role in the series of erotic prints &quot;I Modi&quot;, and then, according to Vasari, lost all his money in the Sack of Rome in 1527, after which none of his work can be securely dated.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Marcantonio&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, but was by 1482 at the latest. He was possibly born in Argine, near Bologna, Italy, where he is assumed to have grown up. He trained in the workshop of the leading goldsmith and painter in Bologna, Francesco Francia. Vasari claimed that Marcantonio quickly demonstrated more aptitude than Francia, and started designing and producing fashionable waist-buckles (among other items) in &quot;niello&quot; (engraved metal which is filled in with alloy in a contrasting colour). This is doubted, however, by Arthur Mayger Hind, who sees no evidence of a background in niello technique in his early engravings.

No paintings produced by Marcantonio are known or documented, although some drawings survive. His first dated engraving, &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, comes from 1505, although a number of undated works come from the years before this. From 1505–11, Marcantonio engraved about 80 pieces, with a wide variety of subject matter, from pagan mythology, to religious scenes. 
His early works use his own compositions, combining elements from Francia and other North Italian artists, and like all Italian printmakers in these years he was strongly affected by the enormously accomplished prints of Dürer, which were widely distributed in Italy. Like other printmakers such as Giulio Campagnola, he borrowed elements of Dürer&#x27;s landscapes in a cut and paste fashion, and also borrowed from his technique. Dürer was in Bologna in 1506, as was Michelangelo, and he may have met one or both of them.

===Reproductions===
About this time he began to make copies of Dürer&#x27;s woodcut series, the Life of the Virgin. This was extremely common practice, although normally engravers copied other expensive engravings rather than the cheaper woodcuts. However Dürer&#x27;s woodcuts had raised the standard of the medium considerably, and since Marcantonio continued to copy a large number of both Dürer&#x27;s engravings and woodcuts, he must have found it profitable.

His early copies included Dürer&#x27;s famous AD monogram, and Dürer made a complaint to the Venetian Government, which won him some legal protection for his monogram, but not his compositions, in Venetian territory - an important case in the slowly evolving history of intellectual property law.

Marcantonio appears to have spent some of the last half of the decade in Venice, but no dates are known.

===Rome===
Around 1510, Marcantonio travelled to Rome and entered the circle of artists surrounding Raphael. This influence began showing up in engravings titled &quot;The Climbers&quot; (in which he reproduced part of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers surprised bathing&quot;, also called &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot;). After a reproduction of a work by Raphael, entitled &quot;Lucretia&quot;, Raphael trained and assisted Marcantonio personally.

Another famous engraving, the &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot;, dated 1515 or 1516, after Raphael, became the composition source for Édouard Manet when he painted The Luncheon on the Grass.

The two started a successful printing establishment under a colorgrinder, Il Baveria, that quickly expanded into an engraving school with Marcantonio at the head. Among his most distinguished pupils were Marco Dente (Marco da Ravenna), Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio and Agostino de Musi (Agostino Veneziano).

===Later years===
Marcantonio and his pupils continued to make engravings based upon Raphael&#x27;s work, even after Raphael&#x27;s death in 1520. In many instances, Marcantonio would not copy the finished painting, but instead worked from early sketches and drafts. This method produced variations on a theme and were moderately successful.

Around 1524, Marcantonio was briefly imprisoned by Pope Clement VII for making the I modi set of erotic engravings, from the designs of Giulio Romano, which were later accompanied by sonnets written by Pietro Aretino. At the intercession of the Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, Baccio Bandinelli and Pietro Aretino, he was released, and set to work on his plate of the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Lawrence&quot; after Bandinelli.

During the Sack of Rome, in 1527, he was forced to pay a heavy ransom by the Spaniards and fled in poverty. It is unclear where he stayed after his departure from Rome until his death in 1534.

<text>Wemade Co., Ltd (), formerly Wemade Entertainment Co., Ltd, is a South Korean video game developer, based in Seongnam. They are the creators of the Legend of Mir series of MMORPGs, the two most successful being &quot;The Legend of Mir 2&quot;, and its sequel &quot;The Legend of Mir 3&quot;. &quot;Legend of Mir&quot; has attracted over 120 million users in Asia, and generated over $65 million a month in revenue during its height. Even today, in its ninth year of operation, &quot;Legend of Mir 2&quot; still generates well over $20 million a month in China alone.

According to Forbes, Wemade&#x27;s founder, Kwan Ho Park, has a net worth of $1.2 billion, as of October 19.

==History==
Wemade was founded on February 10, 2000, by the original &quot;Legend of Mir&quot; developers. They chose the name WeMade Entertainment to acknowledge a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by their South Korean publishing partner Actoz against the Chinese game operator Shanda. Shanda had copied &quot;Legend of Mir&quot; under the name &quot;The World of Legend&quot;, prompting the lawsuit. In choosing their company name, the developers were making the point that “We made &quot;Legend of Mir&quot;”. Shanda settled the lawsuit by acquiring Actoz and operating it as Shanda Korea.

In 2007, WeMade Entertainment&#x27;s CEO and founder Kwan-Ho Park hired Kevin “Sookiel” Seo as co-CEO to turn the development company into a publisher and operator of online games in South Korea. Mr. Seo was formerly the CEO of Actoz/Shanda Korea. The company grew from 300 to close to 600 employees as it expanded to provide full hosting services in South Korea.

Today, WeMade Entertainment Co. Ltd. hosts and operates several games in South Korea. This includes games developed by Wemade such as &quot;Legend of Mir 2&quot;, &quot;Legend of Mir 3&quot;, &quot;Master of Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Chang Chun&quot; (aka &quot;Three Kingdom Chronicles&quot;). In addition, Wemade also hosts games from other developers including Chaps Online, Tartaros and Avalon. Wemade continues to license these games to other operators in other global territories. Shanda operates &quot;Legend of Mir 2&quot; and &quot;Chang Chun&quot; in Greater China, while Softworld operates &quot;Mir 2&quot; in Taiwan. GameFactory operates Rumble Fighter in the US and Europe.

In the summer of 2008, Wemade established its U.S. headquarters in the Seattle, Washington area. WeMade Entertainment USA, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the South Korean entity. Headed up by CEO Kisung Kim, the US company is responsible for the Western Games market including Europe and the Americas.

WeMade Entertainment USA, Inc. is currently hosting the North American servers of &quot;Lost Saga&quot;, a game developed by I.O. Entertainment. It initially planned to transfer accounts from OGPlanet Lost Saga to the new servers (although the accounts were never made available to them to do so) and the game was fully released on May 2, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, WeMade Entertainment USA announced from the North America Lost Saga homepage, that they will be ending Lost Saga&#x27;s service in North America on December 8, 2013. No answer or reason was given as to why WeMade USA is ending its service of Lost Saga, though there have been rumors. Currently, the company Z8Games will be resuming Lost Saga&#x27;s services in the North America region on December 18, 2013. With the change of services, all the content obtained while under WeMade USA&#x27;s service will transfer over when Z8Games resumes when the Lost Saga servers come online, with the transfer period being from December 9 through December 17, 2013. Further information regarding how the transfer will work is currently unknown.

In November 2020, Wemade released &quot;Mir 4&quot; in South Korea. The game was made available globally, across 170 countries in 12 languages, on August 26.

In May 2022, Wemade made a strategic investment in Froyo Games - a Singapore-based GameFi platform that is co-developing play-to-earn titles with iCandy Interactive.

In November 2022, Wemade has announced that its investment round raised $46 million from a number of companies, including Microsoft. Microsoft has invested $14.8 million in Wemade by purchasing convertible bonds.

In January 2023, Wemade launched its MMORPG &quot;MIR M: Vanguard &amp; Vagabond&quot; (&quot;MIR M&quot;) in more than 170 countries.

&#x27;Night Crows&#x27;, an MMORPG developed by Madngine and published by Wemade, began servicing in South Korea in April 2023. An immediate hit, it topped the sales charts both in Apple App Store and Google Play. The international version will follow in the same year, the company official said.

==WeMade FOX==
From 2007 to 2011, WeMade Entertainment operated a professional gaming team called WeMade FOX that maintained high-ranking &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Warcraft III&quot; players. Sponsored by Pepsi, Skechers, GomTV and Mizuno, WeMade FOX possessed several high-earning players including NaDa and Jang Jae &quot;Moon&quot; Ho. On August 31, 2011, the team was officially shut down, with the former players placed in the care of KeSPA, until new sponsors were to be found.

<text>Roberto Bettega (; born 27 December 1950) is an Italian former footballer who played as a forward.

A prolific and athletic player, Bettega is mostly remembered for his successful time at his hometown club Juventus, where he won several titles and established himself as one of Italy&#x27;s greatest ever players due to his strength, skill, goalscoring ability, and creativity. He was nicknamed &quot;La penna bianca&quot; (&quot;White Feather&quot;) due to his appearance, and &quot;Bobby Gol!&quot; due to his eye for goal.

At international level, he represented Italy at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, and at the 1980 European Championships, helping his team to fourth-place finishes on both occasions; he was unable to take part at the 1982 World Cup, which Italy won, due to injury.

In December 2009, Bettega was officially appointed deputy director-general of Juventus. His role was to act as an intermediary between the players and coaching staff and the upper echelons of the club, as well as taking an active involvement in all of the Old Lady&#x27;s transfer dealings. Bettega left the role a short time later in 2010 after the appointment of Luigi Del Neri as manager.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Turin, Bettega joined the Juventus &quot;Primavera&quot; squad in 1961 as a midfielder. Bettega spent the 1968–69 campaign on the bench. At the age of 19 Bettega was loaned to the Varese F.C. in Serie B. Under Nils Liedholm, the coach of Varese, Bettega hit 13 goals to help the side finish top and gain promotion to Serie A.

Nils Liedholm said of Bettega, &quot;He allies tremendous athletic strength with impressive technical skills. He is particularly strong in the air, and can kick the ball with either foot. All he needs is to build up experience, and then he will certainly be a force to be reckoned with.&quot;

===Professional career===
Back at Juventus, Bettega made his Serie A debut away to Catania on 27 September 1970. He scored the winning goal. Bettega ended the season with 13 goals in 28 matches. The following season, he scored ten goals in only 14 matches.
He scored a goal against Fiorentina on 16 January 1972, but this was to be his last for a while because he was forced out of the game with a lung infection and the initial stages of tuberculosis, although he was still able to contribute to Juventus&#x27;s Serie A title victory that season. He was not out for long, and returned on 24 September of the same year, leading the team to their second successive league title that season.

With the arrival of Giovanni Trapattoni in 1976 as coach, Bettega found himself becoming the main frontman of the &quot;bianconeri&quot; in the late 70s; the former player to take this position, Pietro Anastasi, moved to Internazionale in the summer of that year, and Bettega partnered with his replacement, Roberto Boninsegna, leading the team to notable domestic and European success during this period, including back to back Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, and an UEFA Cup triumph; Juventus also reached the European Cup final during the 1972–73 season, as well as the Intercontinental Cup final, and managed a semi-final finish in the 1979–80 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Bettega won the Serie A title with Juventus yet again during the 1980–81 season, but did not feature extensively in Juventus&#x27;s victorious defense of their Serie A campaign during the 1981–82 season, as he suffered knee ligament damage in a collision with an opposing goalkeeper during a 1981 European Cup match against Anderlecht. After finally regaining full fitness, he took to the pitch for the 1982–83 season, which would be his final season with the club. He retired from playing in Europe after Juventus lost the 1983 European Cup Final against Hamburg in Athens.
In total, Bettega made 326 league appearances for Juventus, scoring 129 league goals and enjoyed a highly successful career, winning seven league titles between 1972 and 1982, the 1977 UEFA Cup (in which he scored in the final) and the 1978-79 Coppa Italia titles. He also won the &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; (Serie A top scorer) in the 1979–80 season. Regarded as one of Juventus&#x27;s best ever players, Bettega scored 179 goals for Juventus in all competitions, in 490 matches, including 22 goals in 74 Coppa Italia matches, and 27 goals in 81 European matches.

After retiring from European football, Bettega played two summers in the NASL with the Toronto Blizzard, helping the team to two second-place finishes during his two seasons with the club.

==International career==
Bettega played 42 times for Italy national team, scoring 19 goals between 1975 and 1983. In 1975, Bettega got his first call-up for a match against Finland. He went on to play in the 1978 FIFA World Cup where he scored two goals to help Italy reach the second round, where they were defeated by the Netherlands, which denied them a spot in the final. Italy finished fourth after losing the third place play-off to Brazil at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespuci, Buenos Aires. Bettega was named in the Team of the Tournament for his performances. Bettega also helped Italy to a fourth-place finish at the 1980 European Championship, a tournament played on home soil.
He was set to represent Italy at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, but suffered a knee ligament injury in a collision with an opposing goalkeeper during a 1981 European Cup match against Anderlecht, missing out on the &#x27;82 tournament, in which Italy were victorious.

==Style of play==
Bettega was regarded as a player of noteworthy tactical intelligence, and in his prime, he was one of the most feared Italian strikers, due to his physical strength and prolific goalscoring ability. A tall, quick, agile, and athletic player, Bettega excelled in the air, and was known for scoring acrobatic goals, due to his elevation, coordination, opportunism, and timing, as well as his ability to make attacking runs to get on the end of crosses, and was an accurate and a clinical finisher with either foot. His elegance, aerial strength, and prematurely greying hair earned him the nickname &quot;Cabeza Blanca&quot; (&quot;white head,&quot; in Spanish).
Considered one of the greatest Italian footballers of all-time, Bettega was also regarded as a complete and modern team player, as he was capable of playing both as a midfielder and as a forward, courtesy of his stamina, vision, passing ability, and outstanding technical skills, which led him to be compared to former Juventus legend John Charles. He was usually used as a centre-forward earlier on in his career, but was also able to play in several other attacking roles, including as a left winger, and was even deployed in a more creative role, as a supporting striker, or as an attacking midfielder, during his later career, in particular after losing some of his natural pace, agility, and mobility. In addition to his ability as a footballer, Bettega also stood out for his personality, determination, and leadership throughout his career. Despite his playing ability, his career is thought to have been affected by his injuries, in particular during the later part of his career.

==After retirement==
Bettega later returned to Juventus at the request of the club&#x27;s chairman at the time, Umberto Agnelli, who asked him to be vice-chairman of the board of directors. He served the position from 1994 to 2006. He returned to Juventus again in 2009 as vice general manager. However, his return was short lived, after Andrea Agnelli became chairman and Giuseppe Marotta became CEO and general manager of the club in 2010.

==Personal life==
Bettega has a son named Alessandro who also started his career in the Juventus system and was the captain of the &quot;Primavera&quot; team.

<text>.tz is the Internet country code top-level domain for Tanzania. Through a consultative process, Tanzania Network information Centre (tzNIC), a not-for-profit company was established and registered (in 2006) to administer and manage the operations of the Tanzania country code top-level domain. tzNIC is a limited company (by guarantee) with two founding members – the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (the regulator) and the Tanzania Internet Service Provider Association. 

On 29 April 2010, the .tz top-level domain was transferred to tzNIC. On 18 October 2018, the members of tzNIC passed a resolution to liquidate itself and agreed to “execute the process of transferring the tzNIC functions to TCRA”. The decision was made after they confirmed that tzNIC had not fulfilled its financial sustainability goal and that the TCRA could no longer financially support it. The resolution recognized that the “only way forward in compliance with the law was for tzNIC’s functions to be absorbed within TCRA in such a way that same present tzNIC staff would continue managing and administering the same .tz registry infrastructure within TCRA”.

From July 1995 until March 2022, registrations were permitted only at the third level beneath the following second-level names:

* .co.tz – commercial
* .ac.tz – schools granting baccalaureate degrees
* .go.tz – governmental entities
* .or.tz – not-for-profit organizations
* .mil.tz – exclusively for Tanzania Military entities recognized by the Ministry responsible for Defence
* .sc.tz – schools that are elementary, primary and secondary level institutions
* .ne.tz – network infrastructure

On 1 March 2022 and effective on 1 July of that year, Tanzania&#x27;s Ministry of Information, Communication, and Information Technology began to allow registrations at the top-level domain .tz without the use of a second-level domain such as .co.tz. The ministry also removed the requirement for registrants to have a local presence in Tanzania.

Additional second-level names were added on Tuesday, 14 February 2012:
* .hotel.tz – hotel operators
* .mobi.tz – mobile phone operators
* .tv.tz – television operators and stations
* .info.tz – informational sites such as museums
* .me.tz – individuals

On 1 March 2022 the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority opened .tz second-level domain registration in parallel with other third-level domains such as .co.tz, .or.tz etc. At that time, registration was allowed only to priority groups, until 1 July 2022 when .tz second domain registration was opened to the general public. Priority groups were existing third-level .tz domain owners (those registered before 1 March 2022) and trademark owners. Unlike third-level domains, the second-level domain is a premium .tz domain, elegant, easy to remember and sounds more professional than other third-level domains. Registration of .tz follows similar processes as other .tz domains, and can be done via any TCRA accredited registrars. For the second-level domain, there is reserved list, and TCRA have blocked registration for some common or popular names in order to prevent conflicts.

<doc id="1238247" wikidata="Q474971" url="?curid=1238247" title="Bank of Upper Canada">
<text>The Bank of Upper Canada was established in 1821 under a charter granted by the legislature of Upper Canada in 1819 to a group of Kingston merchants. The charter was appropriated by the more influential Executive Councillors to the Lt. Governor, the Rev. John Strachan and William Allan, and moved to Toronto. The bank was closely associated with the group that came to be known as the Family Compact, and it formed a large part of their wealth. The association with the Family Compact and its underhanded practices made Reformers, including Mackenzie, regard the Bank of Upper Canada as a prop of the government. Complaints about the bank were a staple of Reform agitation in the 1830s because of its monopoly and aggressive legal actions against debtors.

== History ==

=== Bank of the Family Compact ===

The first Bank of Upper Canada was located on the south-east corner of King and Frederick streets in York, Upper Canada (later Toronto, Canada West). York was then too small for a bank, and its promoters were unable to raise even the minimal 10% of the £200,000 authorized capital required for start-up. The bank succeeded only because its promoters had the political influence to have that minimum reduced by half, and the provincial government subscribed for 2000 of its 8000 shares. The lieutenant-governor appointed four of the bank&#x27;s fifteen directors, making for a tight bond between the nominally private company and the state. Despite the tight bonds, the Receiver General, the reform-leaning John Henry Dunn, refused to use the bank for government business.

The bank&#x27;s principal promoters were the Rev. John Strachan and William Allan. William Allan, who became president, was also an Executive and Legislative Councillor. He, like Strachan, played a key role in solidifying the Family Compact and ensuring its influence within the colonial state. Forty-four men served as bank directors during the 1830s; eleven of them were executive councillors, fifteen of them were legislative councillors, and thirteen were magistrates in Toronto. More importantly, all 11 men who had ever sat on the Executive Council also sat on the board of the bank at one time or another. Ten of the men also sat on the Legislative Council. The overlapping membership on the boards of the Bank of Upper Canada and on the Executive and Legislative Councils served to integrate the economic and political activities of the church, state, and the &quot;financial sector.&quot; The overlapping memberships reinforced the oligarchic nature of power in the colony and allowed the administration to operate without any effective elective check. Henry John Boulton, the solicitor general, author of the bank incorporation bill and the bank&#x27;s lawyer, admitted the bank was a &quot;terrible engine in the hands of the provincial administration.&quot;

William Lyon Mackenzie, the Reform politician and newspaper publisher, was the first to demonstrate the nature of that oligarchic power by showing that the government, its officers, and legislative councillors owned 5,381 of its 8,000 shares. Once elected to the House of Assembly, he criticized the Bank&#x27;s lack of transparency and accountability to the legislature.

====Bank officers of the Family Compact====
* William Allan (1822–1835), President 1822-1835
* William Proudfoot (1835–1861)
* Thomas Gibbs Ridout, cashier (general manager) (1822–1861)
* Henry John Boulton, lawyer (1825-1833)

=== The &quot;Pretended Bank&quot; (at Kingston) and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District ===
The Bank of Upper Canada at York (Toronto) had obtained its charter at the expense of the larger, more economically developed town of Kingston. Deprived of their charter, they established an unchartered bank in 1818 supported with American capital. The government refused to accept its notes given its American ties, and it went bankrupt in 1822. After its failure, the Bank of Upper Canada used all of its influence to prevent any other bank from being chartered in the province. The monopoly was crucial to keeping its notes in circulation and boosting its profits. It succeeded only until 1832, when the Commercial Bank of the Midland District was chartered finally giving Kingston the bank it desired.

=== Banknotes ===
Paper currency was a banking innovation in the era. It had been experimented with to fund the American Revolutionary War but had devalued badly, leading to general distrust of banknotes. Banknotes then were not legal tender, issued by a state bank. They were, rather, similar to cheques written by the bank promising to pay the bearer with &quot;real&quot; (usually metallic) money, or specie, if they returned the cheque to the bank. Any bank that could not redeem its banknotes with specie was forced to close for good.

The Bank of Upper Canada was able to lend out many more banknotes than it had the cash to redeem because Upper Canada was a specie-poor province, and the notes would pass from hand to hand to enable trade without ever being returned to the bank. On average, the bank lent out more than three times more banknotes than it could redeem; it made 6% interest on each note that it loaned out.

The bank&#x27;s manager, Thomas Ridout, estimated that in the first three years of its operation, the bank&#x27;s notes comprised between 74 and 77% of the province&#x27;s money supply. Between 1823 and 1837, its profit on paid in capital ranged between 3.6% (1823) and 16.5% (1832) at a time when the maximum legal interest rate was 6%.

The Bank of Upper Canada suspended payments from March 5, 1838 to November 1, 1839 during the financial panic of that year. It was bankrupt, but a special act of legislature allowed it to continue operating without having to repay its loans with specie. The bank was a small operation, which, like many other early Canadian banks, collapsed in 1866.

=== The financial panic of 1836-8 ===

On 10 July 1832, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill for the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was utilized by a &quot;moneyed aristocracy&quot; to oppress the common man. The same complaint was lodged by the Reformers against the Bank of Upper Canada, which served a similar role. The dismantling of the bank plunged the Anglo-American world into an enormous depression (1836-8) that was worsened by bad wheat harvests in Upper Canada in 1836. Farmers were unable to pay their debts. Most banks, including the Bank of Upper Canada,- suspended payments (i.e. declared bankruptcy) by July 1837 and requested government support. While the banks received government support, ordinary farmers and the poor did not.

=== Bank Wars (1835-1838) ===

The Bank of Upper Canada was the subject of almost continuous political attack. Shortly after its founding, Reform critic William Lyon Mackenzie published a series of articles on how speculative the Bank&#x27;s loan practices were, and how close to bankruptcy it was. That resulted in an event, now known as the Types Riot, in 1826 in which the clique of Bank officers dubbed the Family Compact destroyed Mackenzie&#x27;s printing press. Mackenzie, a bank critic, pushed for a non-speculative &quot;hard money&quot; policy where the bank loaned out only money that it actually had.

Until 1835, all banks in Upper Canada required a legislative charter. Reformers tried several legislative strategies to get their own bank, including attempts to incorporate credit unions such as the Farmers&#x27; Storehouse company. That came to an end in 1835 when Charles Duncombe produced a &quot;Report on Currency&quot; for the Legislative Assembly, which demonstrated the legality of the Scottish joint-stock bank system in Upper Canada.

The difference between the English chartered banks and the Scottish joint stock banks is that the Scottish banks were considered partnerships and hence didn&#x27;t need a legislated Act in order to operate. The joint stock banks thus lacked limited liability, and every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank&#x27;s debts to the full extent of their personal property. The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The Scottish joint-stock banks followed a &quot;hard money policy.&quot; They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive and freer from political influence and corruption.

Duncombe&#x27;s report opened the gate for many new competitive banks to enter the market - just as the entire Anglo-American financial system was coming apart at the seams in a financial panic lasting until after the Rebellions of 1837. The Bank of Upper Canada survived only because of its influence on government.

=== The joint-stock banks ===
Following Duncombe&#x27;s report, the Farmers&#x27; Bank and the Bank of the People were founded on a joint stock basis, until the Family Compact conspired to make new ones illegal in 1838.

=== The end of monopoly ===

The monopoly of the Bank of Upper Canada had been slowly eroding with the chartering of the Commercial Bank, and then the joint-stock banks. The Act to outlaw further joint-stock banks in 1838 again tilted towards monopoly. However, in 1841 the Bank of Montreal, long seeking an entry into Upper Canada, purchased the Bank of the People and quickly began to expand its branch network. The Bank of British North America also entered the provincial market around that time.

As a result, the Bank changed its strategy and in 1850 it became the official bank of the Province of Canada, collecting all government revenue and issuing all government cheques.

By 1863, the bank was struggling; in 1866 the Bank of Upper Canada closed its doors; the stockholders lost all of their investment of more than $3 million, and over $1 million dollars in taxpayers money was also lost.

==Remaining buildings==
The 1827 Bank of Upper Canada Building, its second headquarters (first home was a Georgian building from 1822 and demolished 1880s with current building (now Young People&#x27;s Theatre) replacing it in 1887), still exists, located on Toronto&#x27;s Adelaide St East. It has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Designed by architect William Warren Baldwin, 1825–27, the bank resembled a London townhouse with a Doric portico.

The Toronto building is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada, along with two branches. The 86 John Street branch in Port Hope, Ontario, built in 1857 by Cumberland and Storm (last operated by Ontario Bank in 1881 and now Hotel Carlyle and Restaurant) and the 46 West Street branch in Goderich, Ontario, built in 1863 (now offices for Orr Insurance).

<text>Content Protection for Recordable Media and Pre-Recorded Media (CPRM / CPPM) is a mechanism for restricting the copying, moving, and deletion of digital media on a host device, such as a personal computer, or other player. It is a form of digital rights management (DRM) developed by The 4C Entity, LLC (consisting of IBM, Intel, Matsushita and Toshiba).

The CPRM / CPPM specification defines a renewable cryptographic method for restricting content when recorded on physical media. The currently implemented method utilizes the Cryptomeria cipher (C2) algorithm for symmetric encryption. The types of physical media supported include, but are not limited to, recordable DVD media and flash memory. The most widespread use of CPRM is arguably in Secure Digital cards such as the SD-Audio standard. Note that the available 0.9 revision includes only the portions of the specification covering DVD media.

The CPRM / CPPM specification was designed to meet the requirements of intellectual property owners while balancing the implementation requirements of manufacturers. To accomplish these requirements, the system defined by the specification relies on public-key cryptography&#x27;s key management for interchangeable media, content encryption, and &quot;media-based renewability.&quot;

The use of the CPRM specification and access to the cryptographic materials required to implement it requires a license from 4C Entity, LLC. The license includes a facsimile key for the product which uses CPRM / CPPM technology.

A controversial proposal to add generic key exchange commands (that could be utilized by CPRM and other content restriction technologies) to ATA specifications for removable hard drives was abandoned after outcry in 2001.
CPRM is widely deployed in the popular Secure Digital card consumer-electronics flash memory format.

<text>William Atchison O&#x27;Neill (August 11, 1930November 24, 2007) was an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the 84th Governor of Connecticut from 1980 to 1991. He was the second longest-serving governor in Connecticut history, with 10 years in office.

==Biography==
O&#x27;Neill was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Joseph and Frances O&#x27;Neill, He was educated at Teachers College of Connecticut (now Central Connecticut State University) and the University of Hartford but left without matriculating. He married Natalie Scott &quot;Nikki&quot; O&#x27;Neill () in 1962. He also worked for Pratt and Whitney and sold insurance for Prudential Insurance Company.

==Career==
O&#x27;Neill served as a combat pilot with the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. He was a member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Upon his return, he ran the family business—an East Hampton tavern where residents and politicians often met and where he, by his own admission, learned to listen.

Elected to six terms in the Connecticut House of Representatives, O&#x27;Neill served as majority leader from 1975 to 1976 and 1977 to 1978. He was House assistant minority leader and assistant majority leader. He chaired the Coalition of Northeastern Governors and the New England Governors&#x27; Conference and was president of the Council of State Governments.

O&#x27;Neill was elected the 102nd Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut in 1978 on a Democratic ticket along with Governor Ella Grasso. When Grasso resigned for health reasons in December, 1980 (she would pass away the following February), O&#x27;Neill became Governor and was elected to a full term in 1982 and re-elected in 1986. In November, 1981 he suffered a heart attack while in office, making a full recovery. O&#x27;Neill benefited from the economic boom Connecticut enjoyed during the 1980s when the state&#x27;s job growth was at a recent historic peak. The state enjoyed large budget surpluses in this era. His large re-election victory in 1986 over Lowell Weicker ally Julie Belaga had an effect on the state legislature, which gained large majorities of liberal Democrats eager to expand state government, such as House Speaker Irving Stolberg.

The 1990 recession hit Connecticut very hard, with the real estate, banking and defense industries all faltering with resultant job losses and tax revenue losses. Facing plummeting approval ratings and a budget situation continuing to deteriorate despite the 1989 tax hike, O&#x27;Neill decided in early 1990 to bow out of a re-election bid.

==Death and legacy==
O&#x27;Neill died from emphysema on November 24, 2007, aged 77. He is interred at Connecticut State Veterans Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut. A terminal at Bradley International Airport is named in his honor.

He was eulogized by his fellow Connecticut politicians as Trumanesque. &quot;I always thought the secret to his success was that he was genuine,&quot; said John Droney, who was chairman of the state Democratic party during O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s last term. &quot;He was honest. And he projected the image of an ordinary man called upon to do extraordinary things. He was, in my view, the Harry Truman of Connecticut.&quot; Republican state chairman Chris Healy called O&#x27;Neill &quot;a good and decent man who served his state and country with distinction.&quot;

====Controversy====
On November 17, 2017, O&#x27;Neill stirred controversy by posting on Facebook regarding allegations of sexual assault against U.S. Senator Al Franken. He referred to those calling for Franken to resign as &quot;dogs of war&quot; and decried a &quot;national feeding frenzy&quot; against age-old sexual indiscretions. O&#x27;Neill went on to claim that he had been in sexual relationships with approximately fifty women. In response to these posts, his communications director resigned from his campaign. Multiple state officials, including Ohio Chief Justice Maureen O&#x27;Connor, former state representative and fellow gubernatorial candidate Connie Pillich, Dayton mayor and fellow gubernatorial candidate Nan Whaley, and Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor, criticized O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s comments, with Pillich and Whaley calling for him to resign from his position as justice. O&#x27;Neill initially called for his critics to &quot;lighten up&quot;, saying that he intended to &quot;elevate the discussion&quot; on sexual assault. However, on November 19, he issued an apology for his remarks.

==Professional life==
O&#x27;Neill worked as a civil rights lawyer, small business owner, and union organizer. He is a registered nurse in the pediatric emergency department at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. He is also an adoptive parent.

<text>Montes Recti is a mountain range on the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was given the Latin name for &quot;Straight Range&quot;. The name was approved in 1961 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

This is a small range of irregular ridges that is located in the northern part of the Mare Imbrium. Montes Recti is an unusually linear formation that forms a line from east to west. It is about 90 km in length, and only 20 km wide. The peaks rise to heights of up to 1.8 km.

The small crater Montes Recti B lies in the eastern part of the range. To the west are the Montes Jura and to the east are the Montes Teneriffe.

<doc id="1238294" wikidata="Q16975124" url="?curid=1238294" title="Baylisascaris">
<text>Baylisascaris is a genus of roundworms that infect more than fifty animal species.

== Life cycle ==
&quot;Baylisascaris&quot; eggs are passed in feces and become active within a month. They can remain viable in the environment for years, withstanding heat and cold. Animals become infested either by swallowing the eggs or eating another animal infested with &quot;Baylisascaris.&quot;

==Disease progression==
After an animal swallows the eggs, the microscopic larvae hatch in the intestine and invade the intestinal wall. If they are in their definitive host they develop for several weeks, then enter the intestinal lumen, mature, mate, and produce eggs, which are carried out in the fecal stream. If the larvae are in a paratenic host, they break into the bloodstream and enter various organs, particularly the central nervous system.
A great deal of damage occurs wherever the larva try to make a home. In response to the attack, the body attempts to destroy it by walling it off or killing it. The larva moves rapidly to escape, seeking out the liver, eyes, spinal cord or brain. Occasionally they can be found in the heart, lungs, and other organs. Eventually the larva dies and is reabsorbed by the body. In very small species such as mice, it might take only one or two larvae in the brain to be fatal. If the larva does not cause significant damage in vital organs, then the victim will show no signs of disease. On the other hand, if it causes behavioral changes by destroying parts of the brain, the host becomes easier prey, bringing the larva into the intestine of a new host.

===Clinical signs in humans===
Are the following:
* Skin irritations from larvae migrating within the skin.
* Respiratory discomfort, liver enlargement, and fever due to reaction to larvae migration.
* Eye and brain tissue damage due to the random migration of the larvae.
* Nausea, a lethargic feeling, incoordination and loss of eyesight.
* Severe neurological signs including imbalance, circling and abnormal behavior, caused by extensive tissue damage due to larval migration through the brain, eventually seizures and coma.

===Treatment===
While deworming can rid the intestine of adult &quot;Baylisascaris&quot;, no treatment has been shown to alleviate illness caused by migrating larvae. Despite lack of larvicidal effects, albendazole (20–40 mg/kg/d for 1–4 weeks) has been used to treat many cases.

==&quot;Baylisascaris&quot; species==
Each &quot;Baylisascaris&quot; species has a host species that it uses to reproduce. The eggs appear in the host species&#x27; feces. They can then be ingested by, and infest, a variety of other animals (including humans) that serve as paratenic hosts.

&quot;Baylisascaris&quot; species include:
* &quot;Baylisascaris procyonis&quot; (of raccoons)
* &quot;Baylisascaris melis&quot; (of European badgers)
* &quot;Baylisascaris transfuga&quot; (of bears)
* &quot;Baylisascaris columnaris&quot; (of skunks and American badgers)
* &quot;Baylisascaris devosi&quot; (of fishers and martens)
* &quot;Baylisascaris laevis&quot; (of marmots)
* &quot;Baylisascaris schroederi&quot; (of giant pandas)
* &quot;Baylisascaris potosis&quot; (of kinkajous)

===&quot;Baylisascaris procyonis&quot;===
&quot;Baylisascaris procyonis&quot; is found in the intestines of raccoons in North America, Japan and Germany. It infests 68 to 82% of some raccoon populations, according to the House Rabbit Society. According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, nearly 100 percent of raccoons in the Midwestern US are infected. This parasite can be extremely harmful or deadly to humans.

===&quot;Baylisascaris columnaris&quot;===

Skunks carry &quot;Baylisascaris columnaris&quot;, a similar species to &quot;B. procyonis.&quot; Many pet skunks have died from this parasite. According to several skunk experts, many baby skunks from skunk farms have &quot;B. columnaris&quot; present in their bodies. The exact proportion of skunks that are infested is unknown. Since the worms are often at too early a stage in development to begin shedding eggs into the feces, a fecal test may not detect the parasite, and the pet should be pre-emptively treated with dewormers antiparasitacides.

&quot;Baylisascaris&quot; eggs are highly resistant to decontamination procedures because of their dense shell and sticky surface. They can survive hot or freezing weather and certain chemicals, remaining viable for several years. Bleach can prevent the eggs from sticking, but will not ensure destruction. According to Parasitism in Companion Animals by Olympic Veterinary Hospital, hand washing is an important countermeasure against ingestion, and decontamination of other surfaces is accomplished by thoroughly flaming with a propane torch or treating with lye. Other forms of high heat such as boiling water or steam will accomplish the same result. Children are more likely to be infected than adults because of their tendency towards pica, particularly geophagy. In spite of the numerous raccoons living in close contact with humans, less than 30 serious infections of humans by Baylisascaris had been reported by 2012; but it is thought that some cases are misdiagnosed as other infections or are never identified.

<text>ARO (short for Auto Romania) was a Romanian off-road vehicle manufacturer located in Câmpulung. The first ARO vehicles were produced in 1957, and the last in 2003. For a short while, Daihatsu-powered AROs were sold in Spain and produced in Portugal under the &quot;Portaro&quot; brand. In Italy, AROs were produced and sold under the ACM brand, often fitted with Volkswagen engines.

In 2009, an attempt was made to restart low volume production of ARO vehicles under the aegis of a Czech company called Auto Max Czech (AMC). During the mid-2000s, Russian manufacturer Derways used ARO chassis to produce its Derways Cowboy model.

==History==


The first factory in Câmpulung was built during the Second World War, under orders from Marshal Ion Antonescu, starting 1942. The facility was initially meant to produce airscrews, being an extension of the Romanian aircraft manufacturer IAR. After the war, this factory formed the base for ARO.

===The beginning===
ARO manufactured over 380,000 vehicles, 2/3 of which were exported to some 110 countries on five continents (before 1989 about 90% of the ARO production was exported). AROs were also produced in Brazil, Italy, and Portugal (Portaro) often under another brandname. ARO vehicles were also produced for Spain and marketed under the name Hisparo managed by the company Enasa.

Production started in 1957 with the IMS-57, which was the first model of the IMS Series, produced under a GAZ-69 license. In 1959 the IMS-57 model was replaced by the M59, followed by a new model in 1964 called the M461. Though its styling and design were based on its predecessors, the M461 had clearly distinguishable features also boasting fit and finish improvements fitted with redesigned mechanicals.

In 1972 ARO successfully launched a ground-up redesign as their new family of models, the 24 Series which eventually included many models and configurations. The ARO 24 Series got a &quot;little brother&quot; in 1980, the 10 Series, also produced in many body trims with different engines and in both 4x2 and 4x4 variants. ARO engines and other technology was also utilized in T.V. light commercial vehicles.

===Armored variant===

The ABI (Autovehicul Blindat pentru Intervenție) armored car was built on the ARO chassis, using an ARO engine. Seventeen such vehicles were produced in 1979 and were used for internal security duties. Their armor ranged from 4 to 10 mm and they were equipped with a turret that housed a 7.62 mm PK machine gun, or a 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine gun mounted on top. Top speed was 100 km/h. In 1986, 5 were delivered to Liberia and in 1987 10 were delivered to Algeria. Export variant was called AM 100. The remaining 2 were destroyed during the Romanian Revolution and now their wrecks can be seen at the National Military Museum, in Bucharest.

===Privatization===


In 1998 a Cuban-born American businessman, John Perez, offered franchise agreements to US auto dealers. Some 200 dealers paid $75,000 each for franchise rights, for a total of $15 million. These rights were offered by a company called East European Imports. The ARO was offered as a Warsaw Pact surplus military vehicle. After the franchises were sold, dealers were pressured to send cashier&#x27;s checks or wire transfers to start receiving vehicles that were allegedly being held in a port in Florida. Dealers refused and insisted to pay upon delivery which eventually led to East European Imports closing its doors.

In September 2003 the Romanian state sold 68.7% of ARO to Cross Lander, a company owned by John Perez, for $180,000 US. The contract stipulated that the company had to invest $2 million US, which allegedly never took place. Instead, all of ARO&#x27;s production tooling and equipment were sold off; this was an action which violated the privatization contract. The Romanian state sued John Perez in 2006 for falsifying documents in order to acquire the company.

It was planned to enter the US market with the ARO 244 as the &quot;Cross Lander&quot; 244X, but funding ran out in February 2006. The company &quot;Cross Lander USA Inc&quot; fired all its employees, sold its headquarters and closed down in February 2006.

ARO went into bankruptcy in June 2006.

===Amrom===
The company Amrom Automotive 2006 was negotiating with ARO creditors to purchase the company from bankruptcy, and plans to resume production of the ARO line of vehicles under the ARO name at the Câmpulung factory.

<text>Gary Cates (born December 27, 1955) is a Republican politician who served in the Ohio General Assembly. He was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1995 to 2004, and a member of the Ohio Senate from 2005 to 2011.

==Life and career==
A graduate of Virginia Tech and the University of Dayton, Cates began his political career as a Union Township Trustee from 1990 to 1995. When Representative Scott Nein resigned from the Ohio House of Representatives to take a seat in the Ohio Senate late in 1995, Cates was appointed to fill the remainder of his term.

A reliably Republican district, Cates faced no opposition in the 1996 primary and beat Kendall L. Mays handily in the 1996 election. He went on to win easily against opponents in 1998 and 2000, and ran unopposed in 2002. In 2001, Cates was elected by his peers to serve in as Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, the second highest position under Speaker of the House Larry Householder. He served in this capacity for both the 124th General Assembly and the 125th General Assembly.

==Ohio Senate==
With incumbent Senator Scott Nein unable to run for the Senate again because of term limits, Cates, along with Representative Greg Jolivette and County Commissioner Courtney Combs were seen as potential successors. Midway through 2003, the Butler County Republican party sought to create a proposal that would help to avoid a primary. It focused on Jolivette and Combs switching offices, therefore allowing Cates to seal the nomination for the Senate seat. However, this did not work out. Jolivette decided to seek a fourth term in the House, and Combs decided to seek the Senate seat. Cates faced no opposition for his bid. Therefore, he had a clear path to the Senate in a staunchly Republican district. Against Democrat Melvin A. Smith in the general election, Cates won by about 48,000 votes.

Cates, up for reelection in 2008, was again a strong favorite against Democratic challenger Kathryn Bridgman. He won a second term by approximately 35,000 votes.

On May 5, 2011, Ohio Governor John Kasich announced that he would be appointing Cates as the senior vice chancellor for the division of Innovation and Enterprise Development with the Ohio Board of Regents. Cates accepted, and on May 23, 2011, resigned from the Senate. He was succeeded by Bill Coley, who will serve out the remainder of Cates&#x27; term before running for a full term in 2012.

<text>Francesco Francia, whose real name was Francesco Raibolini (1447 – 5 January 1517) was an Italian painter, goldsmith, and medallist from Bologna, who was also director of the city mint.

He may have trained with Marco Zoppo and was first mentioned as a painter in 1486. His earliest known work is the &quot;Felicini Madonna&quot;, which is signed and dated 1494. He worked in partnership with Lorenzo Costa, and was influenced by Ercole de&#x27; Roberti&#x27;s and Costa&#x27;s style. After 1505 he was influenced more by Perugino and Raphael. He had a large workshop and trained Marcantonio Raimondi, Ludovico Marmitta, and several other artists; he produced niellos, in which Raimondi first learnt to engrave, soon excelling his master, according to Vasari. Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Santa Cecilia&quot; is supposed to have produced such a feeling of inferiority in Francia that it caused him to die of depression. However, as his friendship with Raphael is now well-known, this story has been discredited.

He died in Bologna. His sons Giacomo Francia and Giulio Francia were also artists.

His greatest success in club football came playing for Palmeiras, with whom he won the 1999 Copa Libertadores and with A.C. Milan winning the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. In the Champions League final he heroically played most of the extra-time carrying a severe injury.

There was excitement at Elland Road when Peter Reid brought Roque to Leeds on loan, but it was short lived as the team conceded 25 times in his seven appearances, failing to win and suffering six defeats with Roque being sent off on his home debut against Birmingham City. However, he did score two goals in a League Cup game against Manchester United (Leeds lost 3–2) but his spell at Leeds was not considered a success.

In September 2008, Palmeiras have signed him from Al-Rayyan on loan until the end of the season.

After leaving Palmeiras in November 2008, he was offered to Australian A-League clubs in April and was in talks with Avaí gaffer Paulo Silas in July, but nothing materialised out of it. In February 2010, Ituano signed the former Brazil international, who had last played in 2008 for Palmeiras.

==International career==
Roque Júnior was successful on the international stage for Brazil, having played 48 games (two of them unofficial) and scored two goals, and also captaining them on a number of occasions. He was a starter in the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning campaign, forming the back line with Lúcio and Edmílson. He was later called up for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, but did not make it into the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup due to injury. He made his last international appearance in 2005 and announced his retirement on 4 September 2007.

==Personal life==
Roque Júnior is devoted to helping São José Esporte Clube&#x27;s youth players with a project called &quot;Projeto Primeira Camisa&quot; (&quot;Project First Jersey&quot;).

Roque Júnior was the most popular host of Total Request Live on Brazil MTV (BMTV) during his 10-year stint (2005–2015).

==Management and coaching==
In 2015, Roque Júnior took his first managerial role at XV de Piracicaba.

<text>David Don (21 December 1799 – 15 December 1841) was a Scottish botanist.

== Biography ==
David Don was born on 21 December 1799 at Doo Hillock, Forfar, Angus, Scotland to Caroline Clementina Stuart, and her husband George Don of Forfar. His older brother was George Don, also a botanist. His father was a curator at the Royal Botanic Garden, Leith Walk, Edinburgh. Don was Professor of Botany at King&#x27;s College London from 1836 to 1841, and librarian at the Linnean Society of London from 1822 to 1841.

He described several of the major conifers discovered in the period, including first descriptions of coast redwood (&quot;Taxodium sempervirens&quot; D. Don; now &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; (D. Don) Endl.), Bristlecone Fir (&quot;Pinus bracteata&quot; D. Don, now &quot;Abies bracteata&quot; (D. Don) A. Poit.), Grand Fir (&quot;Pinus grandis&quot; Douglas ex D. Don; now &quot;Abies grandis&quot; (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.) and Coulter Pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; D. Don), and was the first to treat Sugi (&quot;Cupressus japonica&quot; Thunb.; now &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; (Thunb.) D. Don) in a new genus.

He also named the orchid genus Pleione in 1825.

Don was librarian to the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert and compiled for him, &quot;Prodromus florae nepalensis&quot; ... London, J. Gale, 1825, based on collections made by the botanists Francis Hamilton and Nathaniel Wallich of the Calcutta Botanic Garden.

On 15 April 1837 in Soho he married Mary Evans (1788/9–1864). He died on 8 December 1841 from cancer, and is buried at Kensal Green.

In 1938, the London County Council marked Don at 32 Soho Square with a rectangular stone plaque, commemorating him as well as botanists Joseph Banks and Robert Brown and meetings of the Linnean Society.

<doc id="1238328" wikidata="Q7302644" url="?curid=1238328" title="Recognition of same-sex unions in Poland">
<text>Poland does not legally recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have limited legal rights with regard to the tenancy of a shared household. A few laws also guarantee certain limited rights to cohabiting couples, including same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses of European Union citizens also have access to residency rights under a June 2018 ruling from the European Court of Justice.

Article 18 of the Polish Constitution, adopted in 1997, was frequently interpreted as banning same-sex marriage, but a 2022 court ruling states that it does not preclude its recognition. In December 2023, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in &quot;Przybyszewska and Others v. Poland&quot; that Poland was violating Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights by not recognizing same-sex unions, and placed a positive obligation on the government to introduce a same-sex partnership law and recognise unions legally contracted abroad. A bill creating civil unions was introduced to the Parliament of Poland in October 2024. Polling suggests that a majority of Polish people support the legal recognition of registered partnerships and same-sex marriage.

==Unregistered cohabitation==
===Background===
Historical research has shown that during the time of the Second Polish Republic some couples established &quot;marriage contracts&quot; and lived together in joint households. A known partnership involved Marian Kuleszyński and Stefan Góralski, both residents of the Suwałki Region in the early 1920s. While their relationship lacked formal legal status and was kept confidential, the pair entered into a &quot;de facto&quot; agreement grounded in fidelity, an expectation of enduring commitment, and a &quot;friendship for life oath&quot;. This oath comprised stipulations for mutual defense, support, and the safeguarding of the relationship&#x27;s confidentiality.

In 2004, the Public Transport Authority of Warsaw announced it would allow the cohabiting partners of gay and lesbian employees to travel free on the city&#x27;s public transport system, marking the first case of recognition of same-sex relationships in Poland. In 2007, the City Center of Social Assistance of Chorzów said it would recognize persons cohabiting in the same household as a family for purposes associated with the center. In 2011, Polish writer Izabela Filipiak successfully obtained a residency card for her female American partner. In addition, a lesbian couple was granted the right to register her and her partner&#x27;s name on the birth certificate of their British-born son in 2018.

===Statutory laws===
While Poland does not have a specific law on cohabitation, there are some provisions in various legal acts that recognise relations between unmarried partners and grant specific rights and obligations. For example, article 115(11) of the Penal Code uses the term &quot;closest person&quot; (), defined as &quot;a spouse, an ascendant, descendant, brother or sister, relative by marriage in the same line or degree, a person in an adopted relation, as well as his or her spouse, and a domestic partner&quot;. The status of &quot;closest person&quot; provides the right to refuse to testify against the partner under article 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the term &quot;domestic partner&quot; is not explicitly defined. In February 2016, the Supreme Court of Poland ruled 6–1 that the term &quot;domestic partner&quot; includes same-sex couples and as such that a person in a same-sex relationship may refuse to testify.

Other laws also provide limited recognition to same-sex couples. Since 2004, when one partner is entitled to social benefits, the income of the other partner is also taken into consideration. Under article 6.14 of the &quot;Social Aid Act of 12 March 2004&quot;, entitlement to social benefits is dependent on the income per person in a family. The term &quot;family&quot; is used in the act to refer to people who are married, in a &quot;de facto&quot; partnership, living together and have a common household. In addition, article 3.1(2) of the &quot;Patients&#x27; Rights Act of 6 November 2008&quot; allows a person to be considered as &quot;next of kin&quot; for medical purposes if their partner suffers an accident or is seriously ill. The definition of &quot;next of kin&quot; includes a &quot;person in a durable partnership&quot; ().

===Court cases===
On 23 February 2007, the Białystok Regional Court dealt with the resolution of a financial dispute concerning the division of assets between two same-sex partners after the end of their relationship. It held that &quot;cohabitation () should be understood as a stable, &quot;de facto&quot; personal and material community of two people. Gender is irrelevant in this context. [...] There are no grounds for applying different rules to the settlement of homosexual cohabitation from those applicable to heterosexual cohabitation.&quot; The Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling on 6 December 2007, holding that &quot;the constitutional protection of marriage does not mean that forms of cohabitation other than marriage are prohibited by law. There is also no doubt that property settlements between persons in non-marital unions are permissible and that such persons may claim protection with regard to property relations arising during the existence of such a union.&quot;

With regard to housing benefits, the Gliwice Regional Administrative Court ruled on 10 January 2008 that &quot;within the meaning of section 4 of the Act of 21 June 2001 on housing benefits, the circle of persons permanently residing in and running a household with a person applying for a housing allowance... may include persons regardless of the family relationship between them and the applicant, including persons in a &quot;de facto&quot; relationship with the applicant, regardless of their sex&quot;. In 2010, a court in Złotów ruled that the same-sex partner of a woman who had died was entitled to continue the lease on their communal apartment. The municipality appealed the verdict, but an appellate court in Poznań rejected the appeal. &quot;The court found that these women actually remained in a stable partnership. Any other interpretation would lead to discrimination based on sexual orientation,&quot; said Judge Adam Jutrzenka-Trzebiatowski. On 21 October 2015, the Łódź Regional Administrative Court dismissed an application by a woman to have her family name changed to that of her same-sex partner.

On 28 November 2012, the Supreme Court ruled, in case &quot;III CZP 65/12&quot;, that the term &quot;person living in cohabitation with the tenant&quot; () in article 691(1) of the Civil Code includes a person of the same sex. This case involved a gay man whose partner, the main tenant of their shared apartment, had died. The court interpreted the law in a way that recognised the surviving partner as authorised to take over the right to tenancy. Previously, in March 2010, the European Court of Human Rights had ruled in the case of &quot;Kozak v. Poland&quot; that a person in a same-sex relationship has the right to inherit from their partner. With regard to tenancy rights, the Warsaw Court of Appeal ruled on 26 June 2014 that:
==Registered partnerships==
Registered partnerships (, ) are not available in Poland, despite several previous unsuccessful attempts to change the law. The first bill to recognise registered partnerships was introduced in 2002. In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling obliging Poland to legally recognize same-sex unions.

===Early bills===
The first legislative proposal to recognise registered partnerships was proposed in 2002, but did not advance. In November 2004, the Senate of Poland approved a bill allowing same-sex couples to register their relationships as civil unions. The civil unions proposed by the bill would have given couples a range of benefits, protections and responsibilities granted only to married opposite-sex couples, including pension funds and joint tax and death-related benefits, but excluding the right to adopt children. The bill was passed with 38 votes in favour, 23 against and 15 abstentions. However, it lapsed due to the 2005 general election. Only two parties, the Democratic Left Alliance – Labour Union and the Social Democracy of Poland, supported the bill, while Civic Platform (PO), the League of Polish Families and Law and Justice (PiS) opposed it. The Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland was neutral, and the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) did not take a position.

A new registered partnership bill was proposed in late 2007, but was opposed by the government and rejected. In 2008, another bill was drafted by the opposition Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), but was eventually not introduced to the Parliament of Poland due to its low chances of success.

In June 2009, gay and lesbian organisations submitted a petition calling for the legalization of registered partnerships to the Speaker of the Sejm, Bronisław Komorowski. Some politicians from parties opposed to same-sex unions, including Jerzy Buzek (PO) and Michał Kamiński (PiS), had expressed support for certain rights being granted to same-sex couples. Attitudes from some representatives of the Catholic Church had also changed. In January 2010, the opposition SLD, in consultation with LGBT organisations, prepared a draft law on registered partnerships, modelled on the bill approved by the Senate in 2004 and similar to the French civil solidarity pact (PACS). However, the bill stood little chance of passing in Parliament as PO, PiS and PSL announced that they would not support it.

On 17 May 2011, the SLD presented a new draft law on registered partnerships, again modelled on the French PACS law. Agnieszka Pomaska, the Deputy Secretary-General of Civic Platform, commented that it was &quot;time to discuss the legal regulation of informal relationships both opposite-sex and same-sex&quot; and that her party was &quot;open to discussing registered partnerships&quot;. Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the bill would &quot;be passed at the beginning of the next term of the Sejm&quot;, but Speaker Grzegorz Schetyna said that a vote would not be put to Parliament during that legislative term. However, after receiving a petition in favour of the registered partnership bill signed by 23,500 people, Schetyna said that he would probably submit the bill for its first reading in Parliament after 10 July 2011. Krzysztof Tyszkiewicz, a spokesman for the PO parliamentary group, announced that the party would support the SLD bill, but only after the parliamentary elections in October 2011.

In July 2011, the Social and Family Policy Commission and the Justice and Human Rights Commission approved the bill by 29 votes to 10 with 3 abstentions. After the bill passed its first reading in the Sejm, the Supreme Court expressed its opinion on 9 October 2011. The court undermined any further progress on the bill, highlighting numerous legal deficiencies. It also stated that the registration of cohabiting opposite-sex couples was incompatible with Article 18 of the Polish Constitution. Regarding the relationships of same-sex couples, it stated that the admissibility and scope of any statutory regulation required an analysis taking into account international legal obligations, and considering the implications of recent judgments by the European Court of Human Rights. According to professor Miroslaw Wyrzykowski, the head of the Department of Human Rights at the University of Warsaw&#x27;s Faculty of Law, and a former judge of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Constitution requires the introduction of registered partnerships. Eventually, the bill was never voted on by Parliament and therefore expired.

===Developments in 2011–2018===
After the parliamentary elections in October 2011, Janusz Palikot, the leader of the Palikot&#x27;s Movement (RP), said that a bill on civil partnerships would be one of his party&#x27;s first draft laws submitted to the Parliament. Leszek Miller, the head of the SLD parliamentary group, announced that they would reintroduce the same bill as had been introduced in the previous parliaments. The vice president of the PO parliamentary group, Rafał Grupiński, said that its members would have a free vote on the draft law. Stanisław Żelichowski, the head of the PSL parliamentary group, said that he expected the bill to be ignored by Parliament. A new draft law based on the Scandinavian model (not the French PACS), applying to same-sex couples only, was scheduled to be drafted and submitted to Parliament by early December 2011 as a joint initiative of the SLD and the RP. Some members of the PO also declared their support. PSL did not state a clear position on the issue but was believed to be in support. Only PiS were opposed, though some of its members, such as Witold Waszczykowski, signalled their support.

MEP Agnieszka Kozłowska-Rajewicz described the adoption of the law on civil partnerships as one of her priorities, though she added that the ideal would be the introduction of same-sex marriage. She also said that civil partnerships similar to the French PACS were more popular at the time and that the law would be enacted in that parliamentary term. Separately, a government report, entitled &quot;Poland 2030 Third wave of modernity – Long-term National Development Strategy&quot;, stated that an objective for the five-year period to 2015 would be the equalization of rights for unmarried couples. Artur Dunin commented that many PO parliamentarians saw the need for such a partnership law, provided that it &quot;did not go too far&quot;. On 13 January 2012, the SLD and the RP jointly presented two draft laws on civil partnerships to the Sejm. The first bill was the same that had failed in the previous Sejm, similar to the French PACS law (for same-sex and opposite-sex couples), whereas the second bill was similar to the Scandinavian model (for same-sex couples only). The PO also intended to introduce its own bill, which would be similar to the French PACS law but include some additional differences between civil unions and marriages. On 28 June, a parliamentary committee expressed its opinion that both bills were unconstitutional. On 24 July, the Sejm voted against the submission for a first reading on the two bills. One day later, the Civic Platform proposed its own bill, which was submitted to the Parliament in September. All three drafts were rejected on 25 January 2013 by the Sejm, with the most narrow defeat being for the bill proposed by Civic Platform, which lost 211–228.

Following the 2015 parliamentary elections, the socially conservative PiS, which is opposed to registered partnerships, formed the new government. A new registered partnership bill was proposed on 12 February 2018 by the Modern party. It was introduced to the Sejm in April 2018 but did not advance further.

===ECHR rulings and aftermath===
In 2017, four same-sex couples filed a lawsuit challenging the laws that &quot;made it impossible for two persons of the same sex to marry and did not at least provide for any other form of legal recognition of relationships between two persons of the same sex&quot;. A fifth couple joined the litigation in April 2018. Their attempts to be issued marriage licenses were previously rejected on the basis that the Constitution and the Family and Custody Code of Poland define marriage as &quot;a union between a woman and a man&quot;. The couples appealed to the courts, but the decisions of the authorities were upheld. The case was eventually appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In July 2020, the court invited the Polish Government to present its position on the issue. Based on the precedents of &quot;Oliari and Others v Italy&quot;, in which the ECHR found that &quot;the absence of a legal framework allowing for recognition and protection of [applicants] relationship violates their rights under Article 8&quot;, and &quot;Orlandi and Others v. Italy&quot;, in which the ECHR ruled that Italy must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, advocates hoped that the cases would lead to the legal recognition of same-sex relationships in Poland.

The ECHR issued its judgement on 12 December 2023 in the case of &quot;Przybyszewska and Others v. Poland&quot;, ruling that Poland had violated the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8 which protects the right to private and family life, by failing to legalise same-sex unions. The court had already issued similar rulings with respect to Romania in &quot;Buhuceanu and Others&quot;, Russia in &quot;Fedotova and Others&quot;, Bulgaria in &quot;Koilova and Babulkova&quot;, and Ukraine in &quot;Maymulakhin and Markiv&quot;. It placed a positive obligation on the government to introduce a framework recognising same-sex partnerships. In a separate judgement issued on 19 September 2024, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in &quot;Formela and Others v. Poland&quot; that Poland had violated the rights of same-sex couples by refusing to recognise legal same-sex unions conducted abroad. This case centered on a lesbian couple in Gdańsk who had entered into a civil partnership in Scotland and sought recognition of their union in Poland.

Poland has an obligation to implement the ECHR&#x27;s judgments and legalise same-sex unions. On 27 December 2023, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that a bill to legalise same-sex unions would be introduced and debated in the Sejm in early 2024, in line with a pledge made during his campaign in the 2023 election. The bill was added to the government agenda on 8 July 2024 and presented publicly by Minister of Equality Katarzyna Kotula in October 2024. It would allow both opposite-sex and same-sex couples to form registered partnerships, affording rights in the areas of inheritance, property, taxation and support, but would not allow registered partners to adopt. Civic Platform and The Left have vowed to pass the bill. In October, the Archbishop of Warsaw, Kazimierz Nycz, expressed his support for civil partnerships and said &quot;that the Church will not interfere in the legislative process&quot;. A public consultation process was open until 15 November 2024.

==Same-sex marriage==
===Constitutional wording===
Article 18 of the Constitution of Poland states that:
The article was adopted in 1997 following the fall of communism. The purpose of the article has been to ensure that legislators would not be able to legalize same-sex marriage without changing the Constitution. Jurists have generally interpreted it as a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Several lawyers and jurists have argued that the article does not formally define marriage, and while promoting opposite-sex marriages, does not in itself ban same-sex marriage. However, the courts have ruled several times that Article 18 specifies &quot;marriage as a union of exclusively of a woman and a man&quot;. On 11 May 2005, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that:
On 9 November 2010, the Constitutional Tribunal held that &quot;the doctrine of constitutional law also indicates that the only normative element that can be decoded from Article 18 of the Constitution is the principle of heterosexuality of marriage.&quot; On 25 October 2016, the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland stated that:
===Recognition of foreign marriages===

In 2018, ruling on the recognition of foreign same-sex marriages, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that &quot;Article 18 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, which defines marriage as a union of a man and a woman, [...] requires to treat only a heterosexual union as a marriage in Poland&quot;. Specifically, the court ruled that registering same-sex marriages performed outside of Poland would breach the Constitution and the &quot;Private International Law Act&quot; ().

Seeking to test the legal wording, a same-sex couple, Jakub Kwieciński and Dawid Mycek, applied to have their marriage, performed in Portugal in June 2017, recognised in Poland. Their application was rejected by the civil registry in Warsaw, which cited Article 18 of the Constitution and argued that &quot;transcribing the marriage certificate of two persons of the same sex would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of the Republic of Poland&quot;. On 8 January 2019, the Masovian Voivodeship Administrative Court ruled that their marriage could not be recognised under Polish law. However, in a landmark decision, it ruled that should the Family Code and other statutes provide for same-sex marriage than Article 18 would not provide a direct obstacle. The Campaign Against Homophobia praised the ruling, while the Ministry of Justice questioned the court&#x27;s legal authority. The couple sought legal advice on whether to appeal certain parts of the ruling, namely those pertaining to the refusal to recognise their marriage. On 6 July 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court ruling that the marriage could not be recognized in Poland. However, the court agreed with the finding that Article 18 &quot;cannot in itself constitute an obstacle to transcribing a foreign marriage certificate if the institution of marriage as a union of persons of the same sex was provided for in the domestic [legal] order&quot;. Kwieciński and Mycek called it a &quot;historical ruling&quot;. The judgment was labelled as &quot;fake news&quot; by Ordo Iuris, an ultra-conservative think-tank, which pointed out that another section of the ruling stated that Article 18 &quot;does not prejudge the impossibility of legally regulating same-sex relationships; however, it emphasises the special protection of marriage, but as a relationship between a woman and a man&quot;. The court issued a similar ruling later that year, upholding a lower court ruling that the marriage of Agata Kowalska and Emilia Barabasz, performed in Germany in 2018, could not be recognized in Poland but also that &quot;[A]rticle 18 does not prevent parliament from introducing the institution of same-sex civil partnerships in [the] future&quot;. The couple announced their decision to file suit with the European Court of Human Rights.

In another case, the Supreme Administrative Court announced that it would ask the European Court of Justice to issue a ruling on whether same-sex marriages conducted in another member state of the European Union should be recognised in Poland. This case involves a dual Polish-German couple who had married in Germany but sought recognition of their marriage in Poland.

===2018 European Court of Justice ruling===

On 5 June 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of a Romanian-American same-sex couple who sought to have their marriage recognised in Romania so that the American partner could reside in the country. The court ruled that European Union (EU) member states must recognise the freedom of movement and residency rights of same-sex spouses, provided one partner is an EU citizen. The court ruled that EU member states may choose whether or not to allow same-sex marriage, but they cannot obstruct the freedom of residence of an EU citizen and their spouse. In addition, the court ruled that the term &quot;spouse&quot; is gender-neutral and does not necessarily imply a person of the opposite sex.

===Religious performance===
The Catholic Church holds immense social prestige and a considerable degree of influence in Polish politics, having close ties with the social conservative Law and Justice party. The Church strongly opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. Several clergy have also been accused of incitement to hatred, including Archbishop of Kraków Marek Jędraszewski whose 2019 remarks on the LGBT community were compared to &quot;incitement to genocide&quot;. Despite around 71% of the Polish population identifying as Catholic in 2021 (down from 88% in 2011), support for same-sex marriage continues to increase steadily. This may be due to a significant increase of cultural liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. In addition, a series of revelations of child sex abuses by Catholic clergy and the poor response by the church hierarchy to deal with such cases have contributed to a decline in church membership. Another common factor cited among those leaving the Church was &quot;anger at [its] interference in politics and outdated views&quot;, notably on abortion. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. The Polish Episcopal Conference suggested only blessing &quot;individual people living in complete abstinence&quot;.

In May 2024, a Catholic same-sex couple were blessed in a parish of the Polish Reformed Church in Warsaw by Pastor Michał Jabłoński. According to the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; newspaper, the Reformed Church is the only Christian denomination in Poland that blesses same-sex unions.

==Public opinion==
Recent polls have reported a trend in favor of same-sex marriage and registered partnerships. All opinion polls conducted since 2022 have found that a majority of Polish people support same-sex civil partnerships. Support for registered partnerships is higher among young people, people who have a higher education, who live in big cities, who have a higher income, who are less religious and who are politically left-wing.

The Centre for Public Opinion Research (CBOS) has conducted opinion surveys on the issue of registered partnerships and same-sex marriage since 2001, though has often found limited support in comparison to other polling organizations. In 2001, 24% of respondents supported same-sex marriage. This decreased to 22% in 2005, though 46% of Poles expressed support for registered partnerships that year. Support remained relatively stable for the following five years, with support for partnerships at 41% and 45% in 2008 and 2010 respectively. In 2011, the polling organization showed that 25% of Poles supported same-sex marriage, while 69% were opposed. In 2013, it placed support for partnerships at 33% and for same-sex marriage at 26%. This poll found that support for same-sex registered partnerships varied significantly by political parties: 68% of Your Movement (formerly RP) voters, 56% of SLD voters, 50% of PO voters, 24% of PSL voters and 15% of PiS voters.

A 2012 CEAPP () poll showed that although a minority (23%) of Poles supported registered partnerships, there was majority support for various rights and benefits being granted to same-sex couples. 68% of respondents supported allowing same-sex partners to obtain medical information, 57% supported inheritance rights, 55% supported rights to common tax accounting, 55% supported the right to inherit the pension of a deceased partner, whereas 20% supported the right to a refund for in vitro fertilisation and 16% supported adoption rights. A 2013 TNS OBOP survey showed that 67% of Poles supported the legalization of registered partnerships for opposite-sex couples, though only 47% thought it should apply to same-sex couples. This marked a decrease from a TNS OBOP poll two years earlier, when 54% of respondents expressed support for same-sex registered partnerships. A 2013 INSE () survey found that only 30% of Poles were in favour of registered partnerships.

A 2013 PBS poll estimated that 40% of Poles were in favour of registered partnerships, 30% in favour of same-sex marriage, and 17% in favour of adoption rights. A 2015 survey commissioned by Miłość Nie Wyklucza found that 55% of Poles supported some form of recognition for same-sex couples, but only 37% supported partnerships and 29% supported same-sex marriage. The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 28% of Poles thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 61% were opposed. This was an 11% increase from the previous Eurobarometer, which was conducted in 2006. Additionally, the number of those who &quot;strongly opposed&quot; same-sex marriage almost halved between 2006 and 2015.

A June 2017 Ipsos survey found that 52% of Poles were in favour of registered partnerships and 38% in favour of same-sex marriage. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted later that year, 32% of Poles supported same-sex marriage (25% &quot;somewhat&quot; and 8% &quot;strongly&quot;). A 2018 IBRiS () poll showed that 59% of Poles supported recognising same-sex marriages validly performed abroad, whilst 30% were opposed. A survey conducted by the same polling organization the following year showed that 44% of Polish people supported registered partnerships, 32% supported same-sex marriage, and 12% supported adoption by same-sex couples. The 2019 Eurobarometer found a large increase in support, with 45% of Poles in support of same-sex marriage, and 50% opposed. This increase of 17% from 2015 was the second-highest in the European Union, after Germany at 18%. Of countries forming the former Eastern Bloc (excluding East Germany), Poland ranked second in support for same-sex marriage, after the Czech Republic. An August 2019 Ipsos poll for OKO.press showed similar numbers: 41% in favour of same-sex marriage and 60% in favour of registered partnerships, as did a Kantar Group survey conducted the following month: 42% in favour of same-sex marriage and 57% in favour of partnerships. By 2022, support had increased to 64% for partnerships, 48% for same-sex marriage, and 24% for adoption rights according to a IBRiS survey for Radio ZET.

A GLOBSEC survey conducted in March 2023 showed that 54% of Poles supported same-sex marriage, while 38% were opposed. This was the first time a poll had found majority support for same-sex marriage in Poland. The 2023 Eurobarometer found that 50% of Poles thought same-sex marriage should be legalized throughout Europe, while 45% disagreed. A 2023 Pew Research Center poll showed that 41% of Poles supported same-sex marriage (28% &quot;somewhat&quot; and 13% &quot;strongly&quot;), a 9% increase from six years prior.

In a poll conducted in April 2024 by United Surveys, 50% of respondents supported same-sex marriage and 66% supported same-sex civil partnerships. 86% of supporters of the ruling coalition supported same-sex marriage and 97% supported same-sex civil partnerships. A June 2024 poll by &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; showed that 63% of respondents supported same-sex civil partnerships, while an Ipsos poll conducted that same month found that 67% of Poles supported the right of same-sex couples to marry or legally register their relationship. A September 2024 Ipsos found that 51% of Poles supported same-sex marriage, while 43% opposed it. In addition, 62% of Poles supported civil partnerships for same-sex couples, while 33% opposed it.

<text>Jeff Jacobson is an American consultant, former attorney, and former politician. He was a Republican member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 6th District starting in 2001. Previously he was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1992 until 2000.

==Biography==
Jeff Jacobson graduated cum laude with a B.A. from Yale University and received his J.D. summa cum laude from The University of Dayton. Jacobson was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1992 until 2000. He then represented the 6th District in the Ohio Senate starting in 2001. After easily winning reelection to the Senate in 2004, Jacobson was elected to the No. 2 spot as president pro tempore under Senator Bill Harris.

In 2003, it was reported that he was in a strong position to become Senate president in January 2005. At the time, he was Majority Whip, and as whip he chaired the committee that amended HB274 in December 2002. In 2005, as Senate President pro tempore he sponsored Senate Bill 9 to require specific provisions for aircraft in Ohio to be secured, with a milder version passing later. In 2014, he took part in secret negotiations to propose a constitutional amendment to change the redistricting process in Ohio, and the resulting House Joint Resolution 12 was 80-4 before going to the Senate, where it underwent mild changes before being approved by the Senate and then Ohio voters. He also authored the Ohio law requiring that public employees disclose any intent to collect retirement early. In 2006, Bill Harris was Senate president, apologizing after a shouting match evolved from a debate being held between Jacobson and Democratic Senator Ray Miller over racism. During his sixteen years in public service, he enacted legislation on topics such as education reform, tax policy, criminal justice, nursing home reimbursement formulas, election and campaign finance law, the abolition of predatory mortgage lending and the regulation of payday lending, collective bargaining and prevailing wage law, and electric utility re-regulation. He left office due to reaching the end of term limits.
He officially retired from politics in 2008, leaving to become a public policy consultant to clients such as the Ohio Business Roundtable. He served as a member of the Ohio State Medical Board from 2008 until 2009, and as a member of the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority from 2009 until 2014, in both cases appointed by former Governor Ted Strickland. Jacobson has worked as a strategist, consultant, and policy expert for a range of business and non-profit clients.

By 2018, he had been employed by the payday industry as a lobbyist. By 2020, he was a lobbyist representing beer wholesalers, utilities and payday lenders. In 2020, he was also helping GOP lawmakers search for a new speaker, although he asserted that he was only offering insight, not overseeing the process. He is President of Strategic Insight Group, Ltd., a consulting and governmental relations firm serving private, public, and non-profit clients interested in impacting public policy development and state governmental decision-making in Ohio.

<doc id="1238341" wikidata="Q1199530" url="?curid=1238341" title="Trail of the Pink Panther">
<text>Trail of the Pink Panther is a 1982 comedy film directed by Blake Edwards and starring Peter Sellers. It is the seventh film in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; series, the first film in the series following Sellers&#x27;s death and also the last in which he appeared as Inspector Clouseau. Sellers died 18 months before production began; his performance consists entirely of his deleted scenes and outtakes from previous films. Although the Sellers estate sued United Artists and the unauthorized use of the footage was ruled illegal, the film was allowed to be released. The newly shot material in the film stars Joanna Lumley as journalist Marie Jouvet searching for the missing Clouseau – and running afoul of the inspector&#x27;s enemies who do not wish to see him return.

== Plot ==
When the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen again from Lugash, Chief Inspector Clouseau is called on the case despite protests by Chief Inspector Dreyfus. While on the case, Clouseau is pursued by the Mafia. Clouseau first goes to London to interrogate Sir Charles Litton (having forgotten that he lives in Southern France). Travelling to the airport, he accidentally blows up his car trying to fix a pop-out lighter, but mistakenly believes it an assassination attempt, and disguises himself in a heavy cast on the flight, which causes complications in the air and on land. He then is led to an awkward introduction to the Scotland Yard detectives at Heathrow Airport. Meanwhile, Dreyfus learns from Scotland Yard that Libyan terrorists have marked Clouseau for assassination, but permits him to continue. At the hotel, Clouseau has a miscommunication with the hotel clerk and gets knocked out a window several times, trying to get his message from Dreyfus.

Clouseau&#x27;s flight disappears over the ocean &quot;en route&quot; to Lugash, and Marie Jouvet, a television reporter covering the story, sets out to interview those who knew him best. Among the people she interviews are Dreyfus; Hercule Lajoy; Cato Fong; and former jewel thief Sir Charles Litton, who is married to Clouseau&#x27;s ex-wife Lady Simone.

All of these interview scenes provide flashbacks to scenes of earlier Pink Panther films (&quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;, and &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;); but Jouvet also interviews Clouseau&#x27;s father, at his winery in the south of France, providing glimpses of Clouseau&#x27;s childhood, and his early career during college, nearly leading him to commit suicide after a girl of his dreams marries another person, and in the French Resistance involving him failing to detonate a bridge full of crossing Nazis. Jouvet also questions Mafia don Bruno Langlois, a mafia boss antagonist who would appear in the next film, and tries to file a complaint against him with Chief Inspector Dreyfus; but Dreyfus refuses to press charges.

The film ends with Jouvet hoping that Clouseau might be alive somewhere, as she states: &quot;Did Inspector Clouseau really perish in the sea, as reported? Or for reasons as yet unknown, is he out there someplace, plotting his next move, waiting to reveal himself when the time is right? I am reluctant to believe that misfortune has really struck down such a great man.&quot; Clouseau is seen glancing over a seaside cliff, when a seagull flies over and defecates on the sleeve of his coat. The words &quot;Swine seagull!&quot; are heard in the distinctive exaggerated French accent of Clouseau.

The next shot shows the animated Pink Panther in trench coat and trilby hat, revealed to be in place of Clouseau watching the sunset; he turns around to face the camera and flashes his coat open, but his trench coat reveals a montage of clips of Peter Sellers from his five &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films as a tribute to him, while the end credits roll.

== Production ==

Sellers died in late July 1980, a year and a half before production began. After Sellers died, UA tried to get Dudley Moore to take on Clouseau in the Sellers-penned &quot;Romance of the Pink Panther&quot;. Moore refused to do it without Edwards directing and was willing to play Clouseau only one time as a tribute to Sellers (knowing &quot;Romance&quot; was to have ended the series, according from a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview with Moore in 1980). UA wanted the series to continue, but Edwards refused to cast another actor as Clouseau, possibly recalling the negative reception that &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; (1968) suffered upon release. The production featured Alan Arkin in the title role and was made without the involvement of Edwards and Sellers. 

Edwards instead opted to reconstruct Sellers&#x27;s performance from deleted scenes from &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;. Frank and Tom Waldman wrote the screenplays for both &quot;The Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; and its sequel &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; together, and they were produced back-to-back on a $17 million budget. Principal photography began on February 15, 1982, at Pinewood Studios and concluded on June 15, 1982, in Paris. Additional filming took place in Nice, Valencia, Ibiza, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, and Casablanca. The shooting in Valencia was guarded by the Spanish National Police Corps and the United States Secret Service due to the involvement of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s daughter Patti Davis. Footage of the fictional country of Lugash was filmed in Paris, including the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre. 

David Niven appears in the film, reprising his role of Sir Charles Lytton, which he first played in the original &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; of 1963. His new footage was filmed at Victorine Studios in Nice, with the Château de Bellet and the Château Castellaras standing in for his French Riviera estate. Niven was in the early stages of ALS, and his voice subsequently proved too weak to loop his own dialogue during post-production; as a result, his lines were dubbed by impressionist Rich Little. Other returning series regulars include Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, Graham Stark as Hercule LaJoy (last seen in the 1964 Pink Panther film &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;), Burt Kwouk as Clouseau&#x27;s faithful man servant Cato and André Maranne as Sgt. François Chevalier. &quot;Trail&quot; featured the animated opening and closing credits, animated by Marvel Productions. Director Blake Edwards dedicated the film to Sellers, &quot;the one and only Inspector Clouseau.&quot;

Despite the dedication, Sellers&#x27;s widow Lynne Frederick filed a $3 million lawsuit against the film&#x27;s producers and MGM/UA, claiming that the film diminished Sellers&#x27;s reputation, and was awarded over $1 million in damages. Despite this, however, there was a practical reason behind Frederick&#x27;s suing of Edwards. Her primary objection was that Sellers had actually vetoed the use of outtakes from earlier &quot;Panthers&quot; in his lifetime and that his estate should have had the right to control the use of outtakes after his death. The reason the question of outtakes being used had come up in Sellers&#x27;s lifetime was that Edwards had shot and edited a two-hour version of &quot;Strikes Again&quot;, hoping to recapture the zany spectacle of &quot;The Great Race&quot;, with Dreyfus as the melodramatic villain in the fashion of Jack Lemmon&#x27;s Professor Fate. United Artists vetoed this long version and the film was drastically cut from two hours to just over an hour and a half. There have been rumors that a three hour cut existed as well, but no evidence of any additional scenes not included in either film has ever emerged to support these claims. A London court subsequently ruled that the use of footage was illegal and awarded Frederick $1.475 million in damages but declined to bar the release of the film. 

After &quot;Arthur&quot; made Dudley Moore a huge star, he was unwilling to talk about committing to a film series. MGM/UA wanted a transition film if Edwards was to introduce a new character as the series&#x27; star. Using outtakes was, according to Edwards, a brilliant idea (shooting scripts for &quot;Return&quot;, &quot;Strikes Again&quot;, and &quot;Revenge&quot; demonstrate a great amount of comedic material from the three films that was left on the cutting room floor). Edwards had originally hoped to construct a &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;-esque narrative, with Clouseau having gone missing at the very beginning of the story, whilst the memories of the supporting characters would showcase the deleted or unused content. Unfortunately, MGM/UA refused to pay ITC the fee they were asking for the use of the &quot;Return&quot; outtakes, and Edwards fell behind schedule on shooting &quot;Trail&quot;/&quot;Curse&quot; (MGM/UA also ended up cutting both films&#x27; budgets considerably), with the result being that &quot;Trail&quot; failed to live up to its potential.

Edwards&#x27;s wife, Julie Andrews, has an unbilled cameo as a cleaning lady, dressed as her friend Carol Burnett&#x27;s charwoman character.

== Soundtrack ==
Unusually the soundtrack album by Henry Mancini featured a compilation of themes from other Pink Panther movies, with only &quot;Trail Of The Pink Panther (Main Title)&quot; and &quot;The Easy Life In Paris&quot; being from the film itself. The other tracks included &quot;It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio Stasera)&quot; (from &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;), the title theme from &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, &quot;The Return Of The Pink Panther (Parts I And II)&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot; (from &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;), &quot;Come To Me&quot;, &quot;The Inspector Clouseau Theme&quot; and &quot;Bier Fest Polka&quot; (from &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;), and &quot;Simone&quot;, &quot;After the Shower&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Fireworks&quot; (from &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;).

The soundtrack album for the film was released by Liberty Records (LT-51139).
==Release==
The film was released in the United Kingdom from 16 December 1982. It opened in the United States on 17 December 1982.
== Reception ==
The film was a critical failure. Although the film was marketed as a tribute to Sellers, the sequel was universally disdained. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 13 reviews, with an average score of 4.30/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

It was released for Christmas 1982 and grossed only $9 million – $27,294,248.70 in 2022 dollars ($1,341,695 on opening weekend in 800 theaters; $3,247,458 on opening week) against its $6 million budget. In contrast, the previous film in the series, &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;, had made over $49 million. Nonetheless, it was soon followed by a further &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film, &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;, which was shot concurrently with &quot;Trail&quot;. That film did not feature Peter Sellers at all (with the exception of some archival voice work, for which he was not given credit) and instead featured Ted Wass as Clouseau&#x27;s replacement Clifton Sleigh. The latter film was also a critical and commercial disaster.

<doc id="1238343" wikidata="Q28913" url="?curid=1238343" title="Judiciary of Ukraine">
<text>The judicial system of Ukraine is outlined in the 1996 Constitution of Ukraine. Before this there was no notion of judicial review nor any Supreme court since 1991&#x27;s Ukrainian independence when it started being slowly restructured.

Although judicial independence exists in principle, there is little separation of juridical and political powers in practice. Judges are subjected to pressure from political and business interests. Ukraine&#x27;s court system is widely regarded as corrupt.

Although there are still problems with the performance of the system, it is considered to have been much improved since the last judicial reform introduced in 2016. The Supreme Court is regarded as being an independent and impartial body. It has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government.

Since 2014, Ukraine has allowed videotaping of court sessions without obtaining the specific permission of the judge, within the limitations established by law. In 2015 the Open Court Project was launched to videotape civil, commercial, and administrative court proceedings. The Open Court Project has videotaped over 7000 court cases in courts at different levels. The videos are stored, indexed and published in the public domain. In 2017 NGO Open Ukraine has launched the VR Court Project aimed at videotaping court sessions with 3D 360 degree portable video cameras to create VR video records of court sessions.

==Courts==
Ukrainian courts enjoy legal, financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by measures adopted in Ukrainian law in 2010.

The judicial system of Ukraine consists of three levels of courts of general jurisdiction.

Prior to the judicial reform introduced in 2016 the system consists of four levels. The Cassation Court of Ukraine existed until 2003. Those courts were recognized as unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.

===Local courts===
Ukraine has 74 district courts. In 2018 they replaced the 142 local general courts. For example, in Kyiv ten district courts were eliminated and six district courts created. The Pechersky District Court is a particularly active one, as it rules over most of the business community of Kyiv.

===Courts of appeal===
* &quot;Courts of Appeal&quot; (combining criminal and civil jurisdiction), consisting of:
** regional courts of appeal;
** courts of appeal of the cities of Kyiv.

Prior to the judicial reform introduced in 2016, there were parallel &quot;Specialized Courts of Appeal&quot; (either commercial or administrative jurisdiction) consisting of the commercial courts of appeal and the administrative courts of appeal.

===The Supreme Court===

*&quot;Supreme Court&quot; is the highest court within the system of courts of general jurisdiction, conducting the review regarding unequal application of the rules of substantive law by the cassation courts and subject to cases when international judicial institution the jurisdiction of which is recognized by Ukraine has established the violation of international obligations by Ukraine.

===The Constitutional Court of Ukraine===
*The Constitutional Court of Ukraine is a special body with authority to assess whether legislative acts of the Parliament, President, Cabinet or Crimean Parliament are in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. This court also gives commentaries to certain norms of the constitution or laws of Ukraine (superior acts of Parliament).

===The High Anti-Corruption Court===
*the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine is to be established before the end of 2018. Cases concerning corruption in Ukraine will be bought directly to this court. Appeals will be considered by a completely separate Appeal Chamber of the High Anti-Corruption Court. The law on the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine came into force on 14 June 2018.

===Abolished high courts with specialized jurisdiction===
In the judicial reform introduced in 2016 the following three courts were abolished and its tasks transferred to special chambers of the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
* The &quot;High Specialized Court on Civil and Criminal Cases&quot;, covering civil and criminal cases;
* The &quot;High Administrative Court of Ukraine&quot;, covering administrative cases;
* The &quot;High Commercial Court of Ukraine&quot;, covering commercial cases.

The rulings of the High (sometimes translated as &quot;Supreme&quot;) Administrative Court of Ukraine could not be appealed.

==Officers==

===Judges===
In 2012 Ukraine had about 8,000 judges.

Since the juridical reform of 2016 judges are appointed by the President of Ukraine upon their nomination by the Supreme Council of Justice. Prior judges were appointed by presidential decree for a period of five years, after which the Ukrainian parliament confirmed them for life in an attempt to insulate them from politics. This five year probation period was also abolished in 2016. Judges are protected from dismissal (save in instances of gross misconduct). Immunity from prosecution was guaranteed to judges until 2016. (This immunity could be lifted by parliament.) Currently a judge is protected from liability resulting from their judicial actions only.

After judicial reforms, there was, effectively, a hiring freeze, which increased case backlog and caused a dearth of 2,600 judges, about a third of the judiciary, as they retired or were dismissed. In the later half of 2023, due to requirements of accession to the European Union, Ukraine re-opened two judicial governance bodies and sought to hire 1,100 judges over a period of months, and 2,000 judges over a period of years.

===Prosecution===
===Lay assessors===
Ukraine has a jury system; although almost all cases are heard by either a single judge or two judges accompanied by assessors. In fact so few people in Ukraine face a jury trial that in 2018 survey by the Center for Civil Liberties, 64% of respondents claimed that such a phenomenon does not exist in Ukraine. Ukrainian law allows jurors to hear only those criminal cases where the sentence can reach life imprisonment. But even then they are not mandatory. A jury is only appointed if the accused so wishes. Jurors are not formed from random citizens, but rather from those who have previously applied for this role. Citizens are prohibited from joining a jury if:
*they do not speak Ukrainian
*elderly people over the age of 65
*persons with chronic mental or other illnesses that interfere with the work of the jury
*persons with an outstanding criminal record
*persons people&#x27;s deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers, judges, law enforcement and judicial officials, the military, other officials, lawyers, notaries
*persons who have received an administrative penalty for corruption in the previous year
*persons who are recognized as having limited legal capacity or incapable
A Ukrainian jury is made up of five jurors (three main and two reserve) and two professional judges who are actively involved in decision-making.

Jurors are prohibited from communicating with anyone other than the court about the merits of the case without the permission of the presiding judge. They may not divulge details known to them or gather information about the case outside of the court proceedings. Jurors are financially compensated.

==Administration==
The Congress of Judges () is the highest body of judicial self-government.

The Council of Judges is responsible for the enforcement of the decisions of the Congress and their implementation in the period between congresses, and decides on the convocation of the Congress.

The State Judicial Administration provides organizational support of the judiciary and represents the judiciary to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Verkhovna Rada.

The High Judicial Qualifications Commission of Ukraine conducts the selection of judicial candidates, submits to the High Council of Justice recommendations on the appointment of a candidate for the subsequent introduction of the submission of the President of Ukraine, makes recommendations on the election of a permanent post, and conducts disciplinary proceedings including dismissal.

The High Council of Justice &quot;is a collective independent body that is responsible for formation of the high-profile judge corpus capable of qualified, honest and impartial exercise of justice on a professional basis; and for making decisions regarding violations by judges and procurators of the requirements concerning their incompatibility and within the scope of their competence of their disciplinary responsibility&quot;. Three members of the council are automatically assigned for holding the following positions: Chairman of the Supreme Court, Minister of Justice, and Prosecutor General. The other 17 members are elected for a period of six years. The council consists of 20 members. It was created on January 15, 1998.

==Law==
The 2010 Judicial System and Status of Judges Act is the legal basis for the organization of the judiciary and the administration of justice in Ukraine.

===Procedure===
Since January 1, 2010 it is allowed to hold court proceedings in Russian on mutual consent of parties. Citizens, who are unable to speak Ukrainian or Russian are allowed to use their native language or the services of a translator.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Corruption===
A Ukrainian Ministry of Justice survey of Ukrainians in 2009 revealed that only 10 percent of respondents trusted the national court system. Less than 30 percent believed that it was possible to receive a fair trial in Ukraine.

Ukrainian politicians and analysts have described the system of justice in Ukraine as &quot;rotten to the core&quot; and have complained about political pressure put on judges and corruption.

Ukrainian judges have been arrested while taking bribes. Independent lawyers and human rights activists have complained Ukrainian judges regularly come under pressure to hand down a certain verdict.

In 2013, a Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer report showed that 66% of the Ukrainian public considered the judiciary to be the most corrupt institution in the country. Twenty-one percent of Ukrainians admitted they had paid bribes to judicial officials themselves.

===Conviction rate===
Courts maintained a 99.5 percent conviction rate from 2005 until 2008, equal to the conviction rate of the Soviet Union. In 2012 this number was 99.83 percent. Suspects are often incarcerated for long periods before trial.

===Flaws in the system===
Prosecutors in Ukraine have greater powers than in most European countries. According to the European Commission for Democracy through Law &quot;the role and functions of the Prosecutor’s Office is not in accordance with Council of Europe standards&quot;.

Ukraine has few relevant corporate and property laws; this hinders corporate governance. Ukrainian companies often use international law to settle conflicts. Ukraine recognizes the verdicts of the European Court of Human Rights.

Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg stated in February 2012 that systemic deficiencies in the functioning of the Ukrainian judicial system seriously threatened human rights.

On July 25, 2012, a mass protest march took place from early morning to about 16:00 across the city of Kyiv of about 3,500 participants mostly of whom were sports fans of FC Dynamo Kyiv. The event took place soon after a decision was adopted by the Holosiivsky District Court of Kyiv City on the 2011-12 nationally renown Pavlichenko criminal case convicting a family of Pavlichenkos (father and son) to long-term sentence for killing a judge of the Shevskivsky District Court of Kyiv City Serhiy Zubkov. On 24 February 2014 the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) decided to release all political prisoners, including father and son Pavlichenko.

==History==
Ukraine&#x27;s judicial system was inherited from that of the Soviet Union and the former Ukrainian SSR. As such, it had many of the problems which marred Soviet justice, most notably a corrupt and politicised judiciary. Lawyers have stated trial results can be unfairly fixed, with judges commonly refusing to hear exculpatory evidence, while calling frequent recesses to confer privately with the prosecutor. Insiders say paying and receiving bribes is a common practice in most Ukrainian courts. Fee amounts depend on jurisdiction, the crime, real or trumped-up, and the financial wherewithal of the individual or company involved.

The Prosecutor-General&#x27;s Office – part of the government – exerted undue influence, with judges often not daring to rule against state prosecutors. Those who did faced disciplinary actions; when a Kyiv court ruled for opposition politician Yulia Tymoshenko, the presiding judge was himself prosecuted. The courts were not even independent from each other, and it was commonplace for trial court judges to call the higher courts and ask how to decide a case. Courts were often underfunded, with little money or resources. It was not uncommon for cases to be heard in small, cramped courtrooms with the electricity cut off while prisoners were unable to attend because of lack of transport from jails to courtrooms.

Reformers highlighted the state of the judiciary as a key problem in the early 1990s and established a number of programmes to improve the performance of the judiciary. A Ukraine-Ohio Rule of Law Program was established in 1994 which brought together lawyers and judges from the American state of Ohio, including members of the Ohio Supreme Court, with their Ukrainian counterparts. The United States Agency for International Development supported these and other initiatives, which were also backed by European governments and international organisations.

These efforts proved controversial among some of the judicial old guard, but a band of reformist judges – dubbed the &quot;judicial opposition&quot; – increasingly gained support from reformers in local administrations who pushed for an end to judicial corruption. Judges were indicted en masse in Dnipro in the early 1990s, and later on judges from the Mykolayiv city court and the Moskovskyy district court of Kyiv were put on trial for corruption.

Major changes were made to the judicial system when the law &quot;On the court system&quot; was passed on 7 February 2002, creating a new level of judiciary and enacting institutional safeguards to insulate judges from political pressure.

President Viktor Yanukovych formed an expert group to make recommendations how to &quot;clean up the current mess and adopt a law on court organization” on March 24, 2010. One day after setting this commission Yanukovych stated “We can no longer disgrace our country with such a court system.”

In December 2011 certain economic crimes were decriminalized.

Concrete steps the Azarov Government proposed the abolition of pre-trial detention for non-violent crimes, promoting experienced judges with strong records and punishing bribe-taking and corruption in the judiciary. A law passed in 2010 improved the basic salaries of judges, and a more rigorous method of selecting candidates for judges was introduced. But reforms brought many new problems: the Supreme Court lost almost all of its powers, judges become very dependent on the Supreme Council of Justice, and the ability to sue the government was severely limited.

A new criminal code came into effect on 20 November 2012.

On 8 April 2014 the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the law &quot;On Restoring confidence in the judicial system of Ukraine&quot;. This bill established the legal and organizational framework for a special audit of judges of courts of general jurisdiction.

On 26 September 2015 Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk claimed Ukraine&#x27;s court system would be reformed following the example of the National Police of Ukraine, meaning employing new personnel .

In the last judicial reform introduced in 2016 the court system was completely overhauled, including the abolishing of certain courts. Advocacy operates in Ukraine to provide professional legal assistance. The independence of the lawyers is guaranteed. Only a lawyer represents another person in court, as well as defending against criminal charges.

A new Supreme Court was launched in December 2017.

The Kyiv Administrative District Court was disestablished in December 2022 due to its alleged corruption and powerful jurisdiction over national government agencies.

<text>Patricia M. Clancy is a former Republican member of the Ohio General Assembly, representing the 8th District from 2005 to 2007. She is the daughter of former Cincinnati Mayor and U.S. Congressman Donald D. Clancy. Clancy first ran for the Ohio House of Representatives in 1996, after Representative Lou Blessing opted to run for the Ohio Senate. She won, and was reelected in 1998 and 2000. For the 124th Ohio General Assembly, Clancy was named as majority leader of the House. She won a final term in the House 2002, before facing term limits.

By 2004, Clancy had served four two-year terms in the Ohio House of Representatives and was prevented by Ohio&#x27;s term limits law from running for re-election again. At the same time, another Cincinnati-area politician, Republican state Sen. Louis W. Blessing Jr., had also run up against term limits. So, Blessing and Clancy ran for each other&#x27;s seats, both succeeding and holding the seats for the Republican party. Clancy defeated the Democratic nominee, real estate agent Jeannette Harrison.

Halfway through her first term in the Senate, Clancy sought and received an appointment as the assistant chief probation officer for the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court. As a result, she resigned her Senate seat on October 9, 2007. In 2008, she was elected Hamilton County Clerk of Court.

<text>The Romanian Bridgehead (; ) was an area in southeastern Poland that is now located in Ukraine. During the invasion of Poland in 1939 at the start of the Second World War, the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered all Polish troops fighting east of the Vistula (approximately 20 divisions still retaining the ability to co-operate) to withdraw towards Lwów and then to the hills along the borders with Romania and the Soviet Union on 14 September. After the Soviets attacked on 17 September, Rydz-Śmigły ordered all units to withdraw to Romania and Hungary, but communications had become disrupted although smaller units crossed outside the major battles.

The plan was a default plan in case it was impossible to defend the Polish borders, and it assumed that the Polish forces would be able to retreat to the area, organise a successful defence until the winter and hold out until the promised French offensive on the Western Front had started. Rydz-Śmigły predicted that the hills, valleys, swamps and the rivers Stryj and Dniester would provide natural lines of defence against the German advance. The area was also home to many ammunition dumps that were prepared for the third wave of Polish troops, and it was linked by transport to the Romanian port of Constanța, which could be used to resupply the Polish troops.

The plan is one of the reasons that the Polish–Romanian alliance was not activated by Poland. Poland and Romania had been allied since 1921, and the defensive pact was still valid by 1939. However, the Polish government decided that it would be much more helpful to have a safe haven in Romania and the safe port of Constanța that could accept as many Allied merchant ships as would be required to keep Poland fighting. Most of the Polish Navy and merchant marine had been evacuated prior to 1 September (see Peking Plan) and would operate from French and British ports and deliver the supplies through Romania.

In adherence with the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which provided for the partition of Poland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east during the early hours of 17 September and violated their non-aggression pact with Poland. However, the French, despite their promises, had not begun any significant offensive against Germany, which made it impossible for the Polish Army to hold out, at least in eastern parts of the country. During the late hours of that day, the Polish government and members of the military high command crossed the Polish–Romanian border with the intention of relocating to France, where the Polish forces in the west were being formed. 

Polish units were ordered to evacuate Poland and to reorganise in France. Polish units launched new counteroffensives in attempt to clear a path towards the Romanian Bridgehead, such as Kraków Army in the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. Some of Kazimierz Sosnkowski&#x27;s units managed to evade German capture and continued the fight in Lwów, but others were stopped and captured by Soviet armored units. It was the intervention by the Red Army, which created a two-front war, that sealed the fate of the Romanian Bridgehead. Fragmented Polish units attempted to push southward and clear paths with limited success and started diversionary skirmishes, which slowed the Germans. The Polish defeat at the Battle of Lwów by the Germans and the Soviets disintegrated the efforts to clear a path to the Romanian Bridgehead. Nonetheless, many small groups of Polish soldiers crossed the border at night.

As many as 120,000 Polish troops withdrew through the Romanian Bridgehead area to neutral Romania and Hungary. Most of those troops joined the newly-formed Polish Armed Forces in the West in France and the United Kingdom during 1939 and 1940. Until Germany attacked the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa and the United States joined the war, the Polish Army was one of the largest forces of the Allies.

The Romanian government also received the treasury of the National Bank of Poland in 1939. Part of it, consisting of 1,261 crates containing 82,403 kg of gold, was loaded aboard a commercial ship in the port of Constanța and transported to Western Europe. The transport was escorted by ships of the Romanian Navy to prevent its interception by Soviet submarines in the Black Sea. The second part of the treasury was deposited in the National Bank of Romania and was returned to Poland on 17 September 1947.

After graduation from the University of Cincinnati, he received a Juris Doctor degree from Northern Kentucky University law school. As an attorney, Blessing worked from the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court before being elected as a Colerain Township Trustee.

Blessing&#x27;s career at the statehouse began in 1983, when he replaced Representative Helen Fix in a suburban Cincinnati district. He went on to serve seven terms in the House, for a total of fourteen years. He never faced considerable opposition in either a primary or general election throughout his tenure.

With term limits newly enacted and looming, eight-term incumbent Stanley Aronoff decided to retire in 1996 before being forced out of the Senate. As a result, Blessing forfeited an eighth term in the House for a run in the Senate. Facing no opposition in the primary, Blessing went on to win the general election with 65% of the vote. In 2000, Blessing was heavily favored in the strongly Republican district. Against Democrat Stuart Manning, Blessing won a second term, securing 63% of the vote.

In December 2002, Blessing, while traveling on I-71 in Ohio, was arrested and charged with a DUI after an Ohio state patrol officer found the state lawmaker had a blood-alcohol level of .11 percent when given a breathalyzer test, just over the legal limit.

By 2004, Blessing was facing term limits himself in the Senate. With Representative Patty Clancy also facing a term limit in the House, there was an opportunity for both Blessing and Clancy to run for each other&#x27;s seats. However, Blessing first faced primary competition in Keith Corman. He went on to win the primary election with 52% of the electorate. Blessing went on to win the general election over Joseph R. Wolterman by about 7,000 votes, and retook a seat in the House after eight years in the Senate. Blessing was the first legislator post term-limits to go from the House to the Senate and then back to the House. He won reelection easily in 2006, 2008 and 2010.

For the 126th General Assembly, Blessing was named by Speaker of the House Jon Husted as vice chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and for the 127th General Assembly was chosen as chairman of that committee.

With William G. Batchelder elected as minority leader of the House for the 128th General Assembly, Blessing was tabbed as assistant leader. However, when Republicans retook the majority in 2010, Blessing was again chosen for the second-highest Republican leadership position, speaker pro tempore. He also serves on the committees of criminal justice, rules and reference (as chairman); health and aging and its subcommittee on retirement and pensions; and state government and elections.

==Initiatives, policies and positions==

=== Social issues ===
Along with Tracy Maxwell Heard, Blessing has introduced a plan to reduce Ohio&#x27;s rising prison population and use part of the expected cost savings to strengthen felony probation supervision. While current law provides that certain adoption placement requirements do not apply to a stepparent, grandparent, or a guardian, Blessing has introduced a bill that would extend the exemption to the husband or wife of a grandparent.

=== Collective bargaining ===
As a member of the House Commerce and Labor Committee, Blessing played a key role in shaping a bill on collective bargaining reform, which will go forth to limit such for public employees. He favored limiting the same provisions for firefighters and law enforcement, although some cite Wisconsin&#x27;s bill as allowing their collective bargaining to continue. Blessing has stated that while law doesn&#x27;t state that employers have to pay non-union members the same wages as union members, it often happens anyway. He believed the bill would ultimately make it to John Kasich&#x27;s desk for approval, which it did. He voted for the bill to pass out of committee, and did the same on the House floor. Blessing has stated that public employees shouldn&#x27;t be concerned that they may receive pay cuts, and that the bill will actually help public employees. He has also stated that the bill will bring more accountability to the public sector. When asked if he would be willing to share in sacrificing his own pay, Blessing stated that he earns his pay, and isn&#x27;t ashamed of what he makes.

=== Voter ID laws===
In 2011, as state House speaker pro tem, Blessing sponsored voter ID legislation. The legislation was criticized by the nonprofit group Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, which opposed the law as erecting barriers to the right to vote. The highly controversial bill passed the state House on a party-line vote on a mostly party-line vote of 57-38.

<text>Frederica von Stade (born 1 June 1945) is a semi-retired American classical singer. Best known for her work in opera, she was also a recitalist and concert artist, and she recorded more than a hundred albums and videos. She is especially associated with operas by Mozart and Rossini, and also with music by French and American composers, most notably Jake Heggie. A Chevalier of France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, twice the winner of a Grand Prix du Disque and nominated nine times for a Grammy award, she is widely regarded as the pre-eminent lyric mezzo-soprano of her generation.

==Early life==
Frederica von Stade—always Flicka (her childhood nickname) to her family, friends and fans—was born in Somerville, New Jersey on 1 June 1945, the daughter of Sara Clucas von Stade and Charles Steele von Stade, a 1941 US Polo Champion, who had been killed by a landmine while serving with the US Army in Germany during World War II. Her early infancy was largely spent in the affluent hunt country of Somerset County, New Jersey, with a brief interlude in Greece and Italy during her mother&#x27;s short-lived second marriage to a US State Department official, Horace Fuller.

She began her education at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart and Holy Trinity School in Washington DC, where her mother worked as a secretary for the CIA. When her mother relocated to Oldwick, New Jersey, she transferred to Far Hills Country Day School. FHCDS saw her in the first of her many trouser roles when she appeared there as Nanki-Poo in &quot;The Mikado&quot;. During her final high school years, she boarded at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, no longer extant, in Noroton, Connecticut. Her introduction to opera came at the Salzburg Festival in 1961, when her mother took her to see Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Christa Ludwig in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.

With the help of a graduation gift from her grandfather, she spent a gap year studying and working in Paris before getting a job as a salesgirl in the stationery department of Tiffany&#x27;s, New York City. She began her performing career acting in summer stock at the Long Wharf Theater and singing in nightclubs and in industrial musicals. In 1966 she visited New York&#x27;s Mannes School of Music intending to take a part-time course in sight-reading, but was persuaded to enrol in its undergraduate music programme instead. In the second year of her course, she began studying opera under Sebastian Engelberg, who remained her teacher and most important mentor until his death in 1979.

==Career==
After a successful appearance as a semi-finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1969, von Stade was invited to join the Metropolitan Opera Studio. A summons from the rehearsal room to a private audition with Sir Rudolf Bing resulted in her signing a three-year contract as a comprimario. She made her Met debut as the Third Boy in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; on 10 January 1970, and went on to play eighteen other apprentice roles as &quot;everybody&#x27;s page or their maid—I was an operatic domestic&quot;.

In 1971, the Met allowed her to moonlight in San Francisco and in Santa Fe as Sesto and Cherubino respectively, but in 1972, hungry for more challenging roles, she decided to embark on a career as a freelance. She debuted as Cherubino in Houston and as Rosina in Washington DC in 1973. That was also the year when she first sang in Europe: she was highly acclaimed as Cherubino—her signature role—in high-profile productions by Giorgio Strehler in Paris and by Peter Hall at Glyndebourne. Soon she was singing in all of opera&#x27;s most prestigious houses, appearing as Cherubino in Salzburg in 1974, as Rosina at Covent Garden in 1975, as Rosina at La Scala in 1976 and as Cherubino in Vienna in 1977. Her recording of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Harmoniemesse&quot; (taped under Leonard Bernstein in 1973) was the first item in what grew to be a large and eclectic discography, and a telecast of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; from Glyndebourne in 1973 launched her on a television career that eventually made her a familiar face on screens in America and across the world. The highlights of her performing life included singing in Washington DC for Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan and George H. W. Bush, starring in a gala staged in honour of the 1992 Winter Olympics and participating in a televised concert led by Leonard Slatkin to mourn those murdered in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.

With a coltish physique and a warm, soft-grained, lyric mezzo-soprano voice that extended into soprano territory, she was a celebrated exponent of &quot;travesti&quot; roles like Hänsel, Idamante, and Octavian, and—aided by her striking beauty—she was also much admired playing leading ladies like Angelina, Charlotte, Dorabella, Lucette, Mélisande, Penelope and Zerlina. In the autumn of her career, she transitioned into character parts, among them Despina, Geschwitz, Tina, the Marquise de Merteuil, Mrs De Rocher, Madeline Mitchell, Winnie Flato and Myrtle Bledsoe. Her repertoire spanned the gamut from the baroque era through the classical and Romantic periods to modern music (including jazz and pop). Her many firsts included the US premiere of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot;, the Met&#x27;s first performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, the first recording of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Cendrillon&quot; and the world premieres of operas by Dominick Argento, Lembit Beecher, Ricky Ian Gordon, Jake Heggie, Thomas Pasatieri, Conrad Susa and Heitor Villa-Lobos. Her appearances in musicals by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim reflected a love of musical theatre that had been kindled when she was a little girl listening to her mother&#x27;s 78s of songs by George Gershwin and Jerome Kern.

Although she was primarily a singing actress, she was also a busy concert artist, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s. The composers whose orchestral pieces she programmed most often were Mozart, Mahler, Berlioz, Debussy, Ravel and Canteloube. These also featured prominently in her enormous recital repertoire, alongside Britten, Fauré, Handel, Offenbach, Poulenc, Schoenberg, Schubert, Schumann, Richard Strauss and the many American composers for whom she was an evangelist and, in several cases, a muse. French &quot;mélodies&quot; were particularly dear to her—a devoted Francophile, she became a fluent French speaker while still a teenager and made her home in Paris for several years during her early thirties. The pianist with whom she performed most often was Martin Katz. (Other colleagues who were especially important in her career were the composers Dominick Argento and Jake Heggie, the conductors Claudio Abbado, James Levine and Michael Tilson Thomas and the singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Marilyn Horne, Thomas Allen, Thomas Hampson, Richard Stilwell and Samuel Ramey.)

Von Stade ceased performing full time in 2010, but she continued to make occasional appearances near her East Bay home and elsewhere throughout the following decade and into the 2020s. Her activities in semi-retirement have included taking part in benefit concerts, judging singing competitions and teaching interpretation in master classes.

==Personal life==
Von Stade married Peter Elkus, a California-born bass-baritone and music teacher, in 1973. Their daughter Jenny (a clinical psychologist) was born in 1977, and their daughter Lisa (a technology company executive) in 1980. They divorced in 1990, and von Stade married Michael Gorman, an Alameda manufacturer and banker, shortly afterwards.

Von Stade is a practising Roman Catholic. Her extensive charitable work has involved her in a variety of programmes, most of them concerned with either education, health issues or homelessness. The main beneficiary of her philanthropy has been the Young Musicians Choral Orchestra, an East Bay organization that provides children from low income families with musical tuition, academic reinforcement and assistance in their personal development in order to help them to win a place at university.

Von Stade&#x27;s many leisure activities include cooking, gardening, golf, sailing and ministering to a &quot;West Highland terrorist&quot; called Sadie.

==Further reading==
Von Stade&#x27;s authorized biography, Richard Parlour&#x27;s &quot;Flicka: The Life and Music of Frederica von Stade&quot;, is scheduled for publication in 2025. She has been the subject of two major film profiles: &quot;Call Me Flicka&quot; (BBC and RM Munich, 1980), produced by Herbert Chappell, and &quot;Flicka: A Love Letter&quot; (Paper Wings Films, 2023), directed by Brian Staufenbiel and produced by Nicolle Foland and Dede Wilsey.

<text>Ogof Craig a Ffynnon (Welsh for &quot;Cave [of the] Rock and Spring&quot;) is a cave in Wales. The cave is about 7 km in length and is located at the base of a quarried rockface in the Clydach Gorge. Water flowing out of the cave is a resurgence of water draining off Llangatock Mountain above.

==History==
The cave was discovered in 1976 by Jeff Hill, John Parker and Bill Gascoine, who had been searching for years for the way in to an underground system that they knew existed to account for the water that resurged in the locality, giving its name to the Rock and Fountain Inn on the road below. The entrance is at the bottom of a quarried rock face in the disused Daren Ddu Quarry, in the flanks of the Llangatock Mountain.

==The cave==
The cave is about in length and is renowned as one of the best-decorated caves in Wales. It contains some early short crawling sections (and what is known as an arduous and uncomfortable boulder choke) and some wet passages with voluminous quantities of mud before developing into a series of large sections lavishly decorated with mud and calcite formations. The most spectacular of these is the &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, a large cavern liberally adorned with flowstone. The &quot;Promised Land&quot; is a long, linear passage section with a small stream.

Beyond the well-decorated section the cave continues in a long series of low passages. It is thought that the cave will eventually be connected to the theoretical Llangattock System through Ogof y Daren Cilau. All the passages in Ogof Craig a Ffynnon occur in the Gilwern oolite which is located below the Llanelly Formation. The resurgences from the cave all occur in this oolite layer or the shales just above and there is evidence that there is much waterflow, from much of Mynydd Llangatwg, emerging in the Pwll y Cwm oolite, which is the resurgence for Ogof y Daren Cilau.

==Access information==
The cave can be approached from just above the old Rock and Fountain Inn on the Heads of the Valleys Road where there is a blocked layby beside some old lime kilns. An old tramroad track leads from here to the Darren Ddu Quarry. The entrance to the cave is at the foot of a rock face and is barred to prevent casual access and vandalism.

Since November 2004, access to the cave has been controlled by the Mynydd Llangatwg Cave Management and Advisory Committee; this means a key must be obtained to gain access through the gate, and the log book should be signed. Round trips to the &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; take about two and a half hours while those to the &quot;Promised Land&quot; take six hours. There is a fixed ladder at the first boulder choke and climbing aids at the second boulder choke, but otherwise cavers need to provide their own tackle. The cave sometimes floods, with a sump forming beyond the first boulder choke.

<text>Stephen Clement Austria (born October 12, 1958) is an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative for from 2009 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party. In December 2011, Austria announced his intention to not run for re-election for the 113th Congress in the 2012 elections. During his 14 years in elected office, Austria never lost an election.

==Early life, education and career==
Austria was born in Cincinnati, the son of Jean C. (née Brockman), a nurse, and the late Dr. Clement G. Austria, a medical doctor. He grew up in Xenia, the eldest of nine children. He graduated from Carroll High School in 1977. His mother was of German descent, and his father was from Tiaong, Quezon, Philippines, and had moved to Ohio to attend medical school. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Marquette University in 1982 and began a career as a financial advisor. The Austria family was named the 1984 &quot;Ohio Family of the Year&quot; and was later presented with one of nine &quot;The Great American Family&quot; awards by First Lady Nancy Reagan. His father sat on the Greene County Central Committee of the Republican Party.

==Ohio House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Austria was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1998 until 2000. Austria won re-election in 2004 against Democratic challenger Charlie Hart in the general election with 65% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Austria was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 2001, representing the 10th District. He served two terms as the Senate House Majority Whip. In 1998, he sponsored the &quot;Internet Child Protection Act&quot;, which was later enacted into law.

===Committee assignments===
He served as Chairman of the Senate Highways and Transportation and Senate Judiciary Committees.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2008
Austria won the Republican nomination for the 7th District after nine-term incumbent Dave Hobson retired. He defeated Democratic challenger Sharen Neuhardt in the general election, 59% to 41%. When Austria was elected, he made history by becoming the first son of a Filipino immigrant to be elected to the House of Representatives.

;2010

Austria was elected to a second term by defeating Libertarian John D. Anderson, Democrat Bill Conner and Constitution Party David Easton.

;2012

Following the 2010 United States Census, Ohio lost two seats in the House of Representatives, due to relatively slow population growth. In subsequent redistricting, Austria&#x27;s district, which stretched from Springfield to the southern suburbs of Columbus, was dismantled, with its territory split between three neighboring districts. Austria&#x27;s home in Beavercreek was drawn into the 10th District (previously the 3rd District) of fellow Republican Mike Turner, who has served since 2003. The largest city in the district, Springfield, was drawn into the 8th District of House Speaker John Boehner. In December 2011, Austria announced his intention to retire at the 2012 elections, rather than run in a primary against Turner or move to run in another district. While one proposal would have seen the 10th retain roughly half of the territory from Turner and Austria&#x27;s old districts, the final map drew Austria into a district that would have been over 75 percent new to him. State House Majority Leader Matt Huffman said that the new map &quot;essentially eliminated&quot; any realistic chance of Austria being able to stay in Congress.

===Tenure===
Austria is the third person of Filipino heritage (after Bobby Scott of Virginia and John Ensign of Nevada) to serve in the House as a voting member. He is the first first-generation Filipino to be elected to the United States Congress.

Austria is a staunch fiscal and social conservative, which is unusual in a district that has historically elected moderate Republicans. His campaign stressed Second Amendment rights, tax relief, opposition to abortion, and eliminating waste in government. He was a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Republican Main Street Partnership.

Austria co-wrote a letter with Rep. Steve Rothman in the wake of the Itamar attack claiming that any peace attempt in the Middle East had to recognize that &quot;Palestinian incitement continues and there is almost no effort by them to promote coexistence and peace.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs

==Post-congressional career==
Austria has a consulting business, and serves on an advisory board for the Republican National Committee and remains active in politics. As of 2014, Austria is on the Republican State Central Committee, representing the 10th District, and sits on the Republican National Committee&#x27;s Asian American Advisory Council.

==Personal life==
Austria has lived in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, for more than 20 years with his wife Eileen, and their three sons Brian, Kevin and Eric. Austria is a Catholic.
