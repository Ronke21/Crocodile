<text>The Five Trees in [[Paradise]] is an esoteric or allegorical image from the Coptic Gospel of Thomas, a collection of &quot;logia&quot; (sayings) of Jesus.

&quot;Blessed is he who was before he came into being&quot; is similar to other enigmatic statements commonly found in mysticism, and may refer to the benefits of self-awareness (knowledge of one&#x27;s true nature) before developing one&#x27;s ego-identity. &quot;If you [listen], these stones will minister to you,&quot; may refer to &quot;listening&quot; to the true self within – accurately tracing the internal by observing the external – or it may mean that only through self-awareness are we able to understand Jesus&#x27; symbolic language and master external reality.

In the Acts of Thomas ch. 27, during an anointing ceremony, the apostle implores, &quot;Come, elder of the five members, mind, thought, reflection, consideration, reason; communicate with these young men.&quot; According to Theodore bar Konai, the five words for &#x27;mind&#x27; are the equivalents of &quot;&quot; (sanity), &quot;&quot; (reason), &quot;&quot; (mindfulness), &quot;&quot; (imagination), &quot;&quot; (intention) – considered the Five Manifestations of the Father of Greatness which may provide the clue to the meaning of the five trees. These five would therefore be the causal factors in the experience of the Real.

Marvin Meyer writes: &quot;The &quot;five trees&quot; in paradise are mentioned frequently in gnostic texts, ordinarily without explanation or elaboration. In Manichaean Psalm Book 161, 17–29, it is said that various features of life and faith are put together in groups of five. This section opens with the statement, &#x27;For [five] are the trees that are in paradise ... in summer and winter.&#x27; On the trees in paradise according to Genesis, see Genesis 2:9.&quot;

==Senses==
According to the Naassenes, &quot;Paradise&quot; in this allegory represents the human head. It has been suggested that the &quot;five trees&quot; represent the five human senses which produce one&#x27;s internal worldview, knowledge of which is a requirement for purification and enlightenment. However, the body&#x27;s five senses – representative of lower-level egoism and learned misperception – would more likely be considered an impediment to reunion with the divine.

<text>Bruno Lüdke (3 April 1908 – 8 April 1944) was a German alleged serial killer. Police officials connected him to at least 51 murder victims, mainly women, killed in a 15-year period, which began in 1928 and ended with his arrest in 1943. He was killed during the Nazi regime without a trial. It is now considered very likely that he did not commit any of the crimes he is accused of.

==Arrest==
Born in Köpenick, Lüdke had a mild intellectual disability (he could not, for example, tell interrogators how many minutes there were in an hour) and worked as a coachman. He was well known by the local police as a petty thief and peeping tom. On 31 January 1943, a woman was found murdered in the woods near Köpenick, strangled with her own shawl. The victim showed signs of post-mortem sexual abuse, and her purse was missing. Police brought in Lüdke for questioning on 18 March 1943, where he quickly confessed to murdering not only the woman but also several other victims, and was taken into custody. Witnesses report Lüdke showed signs of physical abuse and he stated that &quot;they would kill me if I didn&#x27;t confess&quot;.
Lüdke was never put on trial for any of the killings. Declared insane, he was sent to the SS-run Institute of Criminological Medicine in Vienna, where medical experiments were carried out on him until his death, when an experiment went wrong in 1944.

==Controversy and question of innocence==
The 50-odd crime scenes showed no similarities in modus operandi, signature, or motive. No fingerprints were ever found and no evidence against Lüdke has ever been presented. Attempts at reopening the case by members of the Kriminalrat (Detective Major) Faulhaber yielded no results. The true nature of the 51 murders remains unsolved.

A Dutch former Chief of police named Jan Blaauw investigated original police reports, finding them inconclusive, incoherent, and vague. He also expressed his disbelief that a semi-illiterate, who once got caught stealing a chicken, could evade authorities for nearly 20 years, let alone get away with murder. Blaauw also proved that Lüdke could not have committed many of the crimes across Germany logistically.

The opinion of Lüdke as a murderer persisted until the 1990s. Today most historians believe Lüdke to be the victim of a frame-up, carried out by an ambitious Kriminalkommissar (Detective Captain) Franz, the heavily censored Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, and the Nazi government, that saw people with intellectual disabilities as inferior and welcome scapegoats.

== Film adaption ==
A 1957 movie directed by Robert Siodmak, &quot;Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam&quot; (English-language title &quot;The Devil Strikes at Night&quot;), doubted Lüdke as one of Germany&#x27;s worst serial killers. The successful film won the German Film Award for Best Fiction Film and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Memorial ==

In 2021, a &quot;Stolperstein&quot; was erected at Lüdke&#x27;s former home in memory of him as a victim of the Nazi regime. The campaign was initiated by the actor Mario Adorf, who played Lüdke in &quot;Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam&quot; and later regretted the role after Lüdke&#x27;s innocence was established.

<doc id="1261154" wikidata="Q1210992" url="?curid=1261154" title="Turiya">
<text>In Hindu philosophy, turiya (Sanskrit: तुरीय, meaning &quot;the fourth&quot;), also referred to as chaturiya or chaturtha, is the true self (&quot;atman&quot;) beyond the three common states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, and dreamless deep sleep). It is postulated in several Upanishads and explicated in Gaudapada&#x27;s &quot;Mandukya Karika&quot;.

==Upanishads==
&quot;Turiya&quot; as &#x27;the fourth&#x27; is referred to in a number of principal Upanishads. One of the earliest mentions of the phrase &quot;turiya&quot;, &quot;fourth&quot;, is in verse 5.14.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (7th-6th century BCE), referring to a &#x27;fourth foot&#x27; of the &quot;Gayatri Mantra&quot;, the first, second and third foot being the 24 syllables of this mantra:
According to Raju, chapter 8.7 through 8.12 of the Chandogya Upanishad (7th-6th century BCE) , though not mentioning &quot;turiya&quot;, &#x27;anticipate&#x27; the Mandukya Upanishad and it&#x27;s treatment of &quot;turiya&quot;. These verses of the Chandogya Upanishad set out a dialogue between Indra and Virocana, in search of &quot;atman&quot;, the immortal perceiver, and Prajapati, their teacher. After rejecting the physical body, the dream self, and the dreamless sleep (in which there is no perception of &quot;I am&quot;) as &quot;atman&quot;, Prajapati declares in verse 12 to Indra that the mortal body is the abode of the &quot;immortal and non-bodily self&quot;, which is the perceiver, the one who perceives due to the faculties of the senses.

The phrase &quot;turiya&quot; also appears in Maitri Upanishad (late 1st millennium BCE) in sections 6.19 (in the context of yoga) and 7.11:
Verse 7 of the Mandukya Upanishad (1st-2nd century CE) refers to &quot;the fourth&quot; (&quot;caturtha&quot;), or &quot;the fourth quarter&quot;, the first, second and third quarter being situated in the waking, dreaming and dreamless state:
Michael Comans disagrees with Nakamura&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;the concept of the fourth realm (&quot;caturtha&quot;) was perhaps influenced by the &quot;Sunyata&quot; of Mahayana Buddhism&quot;, stating that &quot;[T]here can be no suggestion that the teaching about the underlying Self as contained in the &quot;Mandukya&quot; contains shows any trace of Buddhist thought, as this teaching can be traced to the pre-Buddhist &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot; Upanishad.&quot;

According to Ellen Goldberg, this fourth quarter describes a state of meditation; the insight during meditation of Turiya is known as &quot;amātra&quot;, the &#x27;immeasurable&#x27; or &#x27;measureless&#x27; in the Mandukya Upanishad, being synonymous with samādhi in Yoga terminology.

==Advaita Vedanta==
===Gaudapada===
Gaudapada (ca. 7th century), an early guru in Advaita Vedanta, was the author or compiler of the , a commentary on the Māṇḍukya Upanishad, also known as the and as the . Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, though he was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. In the , Gaudapada deals with perception, idealism, causality, truth, and reality. Gaudapada&#x27;s commentary on verse 7 of the Mandukya Upanishad:
The fourth state, (&quot;turīya avasthā&quot;), corresponds to silence, as the other three correspond to AUM. It is the substratum of the other three states. It is, states Nakamura, &quot;atyanta-shunyata&quot; (absolute emptiness). For Gaudapada, turiya is the &quot;true &#x27;state&#x27; of experience,&quot; in which the infinite (&quot;ananta&quot;) and non-different (&quot;advaita/abheda&quot;) are apprehended.

Isaeva notes that the Mandukya Upanishad asserts that &quot;the world of individual souls and external objects is just a projection of one indivisible consciousness (&quot;citta&quot;),&quot; which is &quot;identical with the eternal and immutable atman of the Upanisads [..] in contrast to momentary
vijnana taught by the Buddhist schools.&quot;

===Adi Shankara===
Adi Shankara described, on the basis of the ideas propounded in the Mandukya Upanishad, the three states of consciousness, namely waking (jågrata), dreaming (&quot;svapna&quot;), and deep sleep (&quot;susupti&quot;): 
* The first state is that of waking consciousness, in which we are aware of our daily world. &quot;It is described as outward-knowing (&quot;bahish-prajnya&quot;), gross (&quot;sthula&quot;) and universal (&quot;vaishvanara&quot;)&quot;. This is the gross body.
* The second state is that of the dreaming mind. &quot;It is described as inward-knowing (&quot;antah-prajnya&quot;), subtle (&quot;pravivikta&quot;), and burning (taijasa)&quot;. This is the subtle body.
* The third state is the state of deep sleep. In this state, the underlying ground of consciousness is undistracted. &quot;[T]he Lord of all (&quot;sarv’-eshvara&quot;), the knower of all (&quot;sarva-jnya&quot;), the inner controller (&quot;antar-yami&quot;), the source of all (&quot;yonih sarvasya&quot;), the origin and dissolution of created things (&quot;prabhav-apyayau hi bhutanam&quot;)&quot;. This is the causal body.

Turiya is liberation, the autonomous realization of the non-causal Brahman beyond and underlying these three states.

==Kashmir Shaivism==
Kashmir Shaivism holds the state called &quot;turya&quot; – the fourth state. It is neither wakefulness, dreaming, nor deep sleep. In reality, it exists in the junction between any of these three states, i.e. between waking and dreaming, between dreaming and deep sleep, and between deep sleep and waking. In Kashmir Shaivism there exists a fifth state of consciousness called Turiyatita - &quot; the state beyond Turiya.&quot; Turiyatita, also called the void or shunya is the state where one attains liberation otherwise known as jivanmukti or moksha.

Based on the Tantraloka an extended model of seven consecutive stages of turiya is presented by Swami Lakshman Joo. These stages are called:
# Nijānanda
# Nirānanda
# Parānanda
# Brahmānanda
# Mahānanda
# Chidānanda
# Jagadānanda
While turiya stages 1 - 6 are attributed to the &quot;internal subjective samādhi&quot; (nimīlanā samādhi), once samādhi becomes permanently established in the seventh turiya stage it is described to span not only the internal subjective world anymore but beyond that also the whole external objective world (unimīlanā samādhi).

<doc id="1261161" wikidata="Q573170" url="?curid=1261161" title="Anthony Downs">
<text>Anthony Downs (November 21, 1930October 2, 2021) was an American economist specializing in public policy and public administration. His research focuses included political choice theory, rent control, affordable housing, and transportation economics. He wrote a number of books including, &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot; (1957) and &quot;Inside Bureaucracy&quot; (1967), which have been major influences on the public choice school of political economy. In &quot;Downs&#x27;s Law of Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion&quot; (1962), he predicted that expanding expressways could not reduce traffic congestion, since demand would increase as well, and that reducing speeds increases capacity.

He served as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., member of faculty at the University of Chicago and a visiting fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco. Downs was also an elected fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

== Early life ==
James Anthony Downs was born on November 21, 1930, in Evanston, Illinois. His father was the founder of a consulting firm, Real Estate Research Corporation, and a frequent speaker on real estate related topics. He grew up in Park Ridge, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

He received a B.A. in international relations and political theory from Carleton College in 1952. During this time he was the elected president of the college student body. He would later credit this experience for some of his interests in studying democracy. He went to the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University on a scholarship to pursue his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics, obtaining his doctorate in 1956.

He enlisted in the Navy and served as an intelligence officer when he was drafted. During this time he also served on an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea. He quit the service after three years to join his father&#x27;s consulting firm and also briefly served as a member of the faculty at the University of Chicago.

== Career ==
Downs served as a consultant to many of the nation&#x27;s largest corporations and public institutions, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the National Commission on Urban Problems in 1967, and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp appointed him to the Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing in 1989. He was an officer or trustee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

=== Democracy and the left–right continuum ===
In his work, &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot; (1957), Downs introduced a left–right axis to economic theory. On the &quot;left&quot; he placed communist parties that want entirely state-planned economies, and on the &quot;right&quot; he placed conservative parties that demand an entirely deregulated economy.

He claimed that most voters have incomplete information when voting for political candidates in a democracy, and therefore will resort to economic issues of &quot;how much government intervention in the economy there should be&quot; and how parties will control this. Downs borrowed the curve from Harold Hotelling, who developed it to explain how grocery stores targeted customers. Downs&#x27;s book has since become one of the most cited books in political science. His left–right axis model has been integrated into the median voter theory first articulated by Duncan Black.

In &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot; (1957), an early work in rational choice theory, Downs posited the paradox of voting, which claimed that significant elements of political life could not be explained in terms of voter self-interest. Downs showed that in democracies the aggregate distribution of political opinion forms a bell-shaped curve, with most voters possessing moderate opinions; he argued that this fact forces political parties in democracies to adopt centrist positions.

=== Housing and traffic policy ===
Later, Downs concerned himself with housing policy, writing about rent control and affordable housing. &quot;The Revolution in Real Estate Finance&quot; (1985) predicted a long-term housing slowdown and decrease in housing prices. Downs had involved himself with transportation economics.

In 1962, Downs published his &quot;Downs&#x27;s Law of Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion&quot;. This law states that on &quot;urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet maximum capacity&quot;. Therefore, expanding the expressway network does not help against traffic jams. A complex set of forces lie behind this law, which were analyzed by presentation of a model of commuter decision-making and its underlying set of assumptions. Sometimes this effect is referred to as Induced demand. By the same token, e.g. the 1965 &quot;Highway Capacity Manual&quot; stated that the capacity of a highway or motorway increases with decreasing traffic speed, until its maximum capacity is reached at about 50 km/h (30 mph). (Cf. Braess&#x27;s paradox.)

His book, &quot;Stuck in Traffic&quot; (1992), which detailed the economic disadvantages of traffic congestion and proposed road pricing as the only effective means of alleviating it, was denounced by traffic engineers for its insistence on the futility of congestion relief measures. However, enough of his gloomy predictions about congestion were proven correct that he successfully published a second edition, &quot;Still Stuck in Traffic&quot; (2004).

Downs&#x27;s recommendations are starting to see implementation, largely in the form of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes in the medians of crowded American freeways, and through congestion pricing, already implemented in several cities around the world: Singapore (see Area Licensing Scheme and Electronic Road Pricing); London (see London congestion charge); Stockholm (see Stockholm congestion tax); Valletta, Malta; and Milan, Italy.

He joined the Brookings Institution, an American thinktank, in 1977. He continued his work on housing policies and traffic issues management at the institute.

He was the author or co-author of 24 books and more than 500 articles. His most influential books are &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot; (1957) and &quot;Inside Bureaucracy&quot; (1967); widely translated, both are credited as major influences on the public choice school of political economy.

He was a visiting fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco, between 2004 and 2005.

== Personal life ==
Downs met his first wife, Mary Katherine Watson, at a high-school prom. During this time, he challenged her to a game of chess, which she won. The couple were married in 1956. They had five children. Kay died in 1998 from ovarian cancer. Downs later married his second wife Darian Dreyfuss Olsen.

Anthony Downs died of natural causes in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 2, 2021.

<doc id="1261170" wikidata="Q818544" url="?curid=1261170" title="State observer">
<text>In control theory, a state observer, state estimator, or Luenberger observer is a system that provides an estimate of the internal state of a given real system, from measurements of the input and output of the real system. It is typically computer-implemented, and provides the basis of many practical applications.

Knowing the system state is necessary to solve many control theory problems; for example, stabilizing a system using state feedback. In most practical cases, the physical state of the system cannot be determined by direct observation. Instead, indirect effects of the internal state are observed by way of the system outputs. A simple example is that of vehicles in a tunnel: the rates and velocities at which vehicles enter and leave the tunnel can be observed directly, but the exact state inside the tunnel can only be estimated. If a system is observable, it is possible to fully reconstruct the system state from its output measurements using the state observer.

== Typical observer model ==

Linear, delayed, sliding mode, high gain, Tau, homogeneity-based, extended and cubic observers are among several observer structures used for state estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. A linear observer structure is described in the following sections.

=== Discrete-time case ===
The state of a linear, time-invariant discrete-time system is assumed to satisfy

: formula_1

: formula_2

where, at time formula_3, formula_4 is the plant&#x27;s state; formula_5 is its inputs; and formula_6 is its outputs. These equations simply say that the plant&#x27;s current outputs and its future state are both determined solely by its current states and the current inputs. (Although these equations are expressed in terms of discrete time steps, very similar equations hold for continuous systems). If this system is observable then the output of the plant, formula_6, can be used to steer the state of the state observer.

The observer model of the physical system is then typically derived from the above equations. Additional terms may be included in order to ensure that, on receiving successive measured values of the plant&#x27;s inputs and outputs, the model&#x27;s state converges to that of the plant. In particular, the output of the observer may be subtracted from the output of the plant and then multiplied by a matrix formula_8; this is then added to the equations for the state of the observer to produce a so-called &quot;Luenberger observer&quot;, defined by the equations below. Note that the variables of a state observer are commonly denoted by a &quot;hat&quot;: formula_9 and formula_10 to distinguish them from the variables of the equations satisfied by the physical system.
: formula_11

: formula_12

The observer is called asymptotically stable if the observer error formula_13 converges to zero when formula_14. For a Luenberger observer, the observer error satisfies formula_15. The Luenberger observer for this discrete-time system is therefore asymptotically stable when the matrix formula_16 has all the eigenvalues inside the unit circle.

For control purposes the output of the observer system is fed back to the input of both the observer and the plant through the gains matrix formula_17.

: formula_18

The observer equations then become:

: formula_19

: formula_20

or, more simply,

: formula_21

: formula_22

Due to the separation principle we know that we can choose formula_17 and formula_8 independently without harm to the overall stability of the systems. As a rule of thumb, the poles of the observer formula_25 are usually chosen to converge 10 times faster than the poles of the system formula_26.

=== Continuous-time case ===

The previous example was for an observer implemented in a discrete-time LTI system. However, the process is similar for the continuous-time case; the observer gains formula_8 are chosen to make the continuous-time error dynamics converge to zero asymptotically (i.e., when formula_25 is a Hurwitz matrix).

For a continuous-time linear system

: formula_29

: formula_30

where formula_31, the observer looks similar to discrete-time case described above:

: formula_32.

: formula_33

The observer error formula_34 satisfies the equation

: formula_35.

The eigenvalues of the matrix formula_25 can be chosen arbitrarily by appropriate choice of the observer gain formula_8 when the pair formula_38 is observable, i.e. observability condition holds. In particular, it can be made Hurwitz, so the observer error formula_39 when formula_40.

=== Peaking and other observer methods ===

When the observer gain formula_8 is high, the linear Luenberger observer converges to the system states very quickly. However, high observer gain leads to a peaking phenomenon in which initial estimator error can be prohibitively large (i.e., impractical or unsafe to use). As a consequence, nonlinear high-gain observer methods are available that converge quickly without the peaking phenomenon. For example, sliding mode control can be used to design an observer that brings one estimated state&#x27;s error to zero in finite time even in the presence of measurement error; the other states have error that behaves similarly to the error in a Luenberger observer after peaking has subsided. Sliding mode observers also have attractive noise resilience properties that are similar to a Kalman filter.
Another approach is to apply multi observer, that significantly improves transients and reduces observer overshoot. Multi-observer can be adapted to every system where high-gain observer is applicable.

== State observers for nonlinear systems ==
High gain, sliding mode and extended observers are the most common observers for nonlinear systems. 
To illustrate the application of sliding mode observers for nonlinear systems, first consider the no-input non-linear system:

: formula_42

where formula_43. Also assume that there is a measurable output formula_44 given by

: formula_45

There are several non-approximate approaches for designing an observer. The two observers given below also apply to the case when the system has an input. That is,

: formula_46
: formula_45

=== Linearizable error dynamics ===

One suggestion by Krener and Isidori and Krener and Respondek can be applied in a situation when there exists a linearizing transformation (i.e., a diffeomorphism, like the one used in feedback linearization) formula_48 such that in new variables the system equations read

: formula_49
: formula_50

The Luenberger observer is then designed as

: formula_51.

The observer error for the transformed variable formula_52 satisfies the same equation as in classical linear case.

: formula_35.

As shown by Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman
and Hammouri and Kinnaert, if there exists transformation formula_48 such that the system can be transformed into the form

: formula_55
: formula_56

then the observer is designed as

: formula_57,

where formula_58 is a time-varying observer gain.

Ciccarella, Dalla Mora, and Germani obtained more advanced and general results, removing the need for a nonlinear transform and proving global asymptotic convergence of the estimated state to the true state using only simple assumptions on regularity.

=== Switched observers ===

As discussed for the linear case above, the peaking phenomenon present in Luenberger observers justifies the use of switched observers. A switched observer encompasses a relay or binary switch that acts upon detecting minute changes in the measured output. Some common types of switched observers include the sliding mode observer, nonlinear extended state observer, fixed time observer, switched high gain observer and uniting observer. The sliding mode observer uses non-linear high-gain feedback to drive estimated states to a hypersurface where there is no difference between the estimated output and the measured output. The non-linear gain used in the observer is typically implemented with a scaled switching function, like the signum (i.e., sgn) of the estimated – measured output error. Hence, due to this high-gain feedback, the vector field of the observer has a crease in it so that observer trajectories &quot;slide along&quot; a curve where the estimated output matches the measured output exactly. So, if the system is observable from its output, the observer states will all be driven to the actual system states. Additionally, by using the sign of the error to drive the sliding mode observer, the observer trajectories become insensitive to many forms of noise. Hence, some sliding mode observers have attractive properties similar to the Kalman filter but with simpler implementation.

As suggested by Drakunov, a sliding mode observer can also be designed for a class of non-linear systems. Such an observer can be written in terms of original variable estimate formula_59 and has the form

: formula_60

where:

* The formula_61 vector extends the scalar signum function to formula_62 dimensions. That is,
*:: formula_63
*: for the vector formula_64.
* The vector formula_65 has components that are the output function formula_66 and its repeated Lie derivatives. In particular,
*:: formula_67
*: where formula_68 is the &quot;i&quot;th Lie derivative of output function formula_69 along the vector field formula_70 (i.e., along formula_71 trajectories of the non-linear system). In the special case where the system has no input or has a relative degree of &quot;n&quot;, formula_72 is a collection of the output formula_73 and its formula_74 derivatives. Because the inverse of the Jacobian linearization of formula_65 must exist for this observer to be well defined, the transformation formula_65 is guaranteed to be a local diffeomorphism.
* The diagonal matrix formula_77 of gains is such that
*:: formula_78
*: where, for each formula_79, element formula_80 and suitably large to ensure reachability of the sliding mode.
* The observer vector formula_81 is such that
*:: formula_82
*: where formula_61 here is the normal signum function defined for scalars, and formula_84 denotes an &quot;equivalent value operator&quot; of a discontinuous function in sliding mode.

The idea can be briefly explained as follows. According to the theory of sliding modes, in order to describe the system behavior, once sliding mode starts, the function formula_85 should be replaced by equivalent values (see &quot;equivalent control&quot; in the theory of sliding modes). In practice, it switches (chatters) with high frequency with slow component being equal to the equivalent value. Applying appropriate lowpass filter to get rid of the high frequency component on can obtain the value of the equivalent control, which contains more information about the state of the estimated system. The observer described above uses this method several times to obtain the state of the nonlinear system ideally in finite time.

The modified observation error can be written in the transformed states formula_86. In particular,

: formula_87
and so

: formula_88
So:

# As long as formula_89, the first row of the error dynamics, formula_90, will meet sufficient conditions to enter the formula_91 sliding mode in finite time.
# Along the formula_91 surface, the corresponding formula_93 equivalent control will be equal to formula_94, and so formula_95. Hence, so long as formula_96, the second row of the error dynamics, formula_97, will enter the formula_98 sliding mode in finite time.
# Along the formula_99 surface, the corresponding formula_100 equivalent control will be equal to formula_101. Hence, so long as formula_102, the formula_103th row of the error dynamics, formula_104, will enter the formula_105 sliding mode in finite time.

So, for sufficiently large formula_106 gains, all observer estimated states reach the actual states in finite time. In fact, increasing formula_106 allows for convergence in any desired finite time so long as each formula_108 function can be bounded with certainty. Hence, the requirement that the map formula_109 is a diffeomorphism (i.e., that its Jacobian linearization is invertible) asserts that convergence of the estimated output implies convergence of the estimated state. That is, the requirement is an observability condition.

In the case of the sliding mode observer for the system with the input, additional conditions are needed for the observation error to be independent of the input. For example, that

: formula_110

does not depend on time. The observer is then

: formula_111

== Multi-observer ==

Multi-observer extends the high-gain observer structure from single to multi observer, with many models working simultaneously. This has two layers: the first consists of multiple high-gain observers with different estimation states, and the second determines the importance weights of the first layer observers. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not contain any risky operations like differentiation. The idea of multiple models was previously applied to obtain information in adaptive control.

Assuming that the number of high-gain observers equals formula_112,

:formula_113
:formula_114

where formula_115 is the observer index. The first layer observers consists of the same gain formula_116 but they differ with the initial state formula_117. In the second layer all formula_118 from formula_119 observers are combined into one to obtain single state vector estimation

:formula_120

where formula_121 are weight factors. These factors are changed to provide the estimation in the second layer and to improve the observation process.

Let assume that

:formula_122

and

:formula_123

where formula_124 is some vector that depends on formula_125 observer error formula_126.

Some transformation yields to linear regression problem

:formula_127

This formula gives possibility to estimate formula_128. To construct manifold we need mapping formula_129 between formula_130 and ensurance that formula_131 is calculable relying on measurable signals. 
First thing is to eliminate parking phenomenon for formula_132 from observer error

:formula_133.

Calculate formula_134 times derivative on formula_135 to find mapping m lead to formula_136 defined as

:formula_137

where formula_138 is some time constant. Note that formula_139 relays on both formula_140 and its integrals hence it is easily available in the control system. Further formula_132 is specified by estimation law; and thus it proves that manifold is measurable. In the second layer formula_142 for formula_143 is introduced as estimates of formula_144 coefficients. The mapping error is specified as

:formula_145

where formula_146. If coefficients formula_147 are equal to formula_144 , then mapping error formula_149 Now it is possible to calculate formula_150 from above equation and hence the peaking phenomenon is reduced thanks to properties of manifold. The created mapping gives a lot of flexibility in the estimation process. Even it is possible to estimate the value of formula_151 in the second layer and to calculate the state formula_152.

== Bounding observers ==

Bounding or interval observers constitute a class of observers that provide two estimations
of the state simultaneously: one of the estimations provides an upper bound on the real value of the state,
whereas the second one provides a lower bound. The real value of the state is then known to be always within these two estimations.

These bounds are very important in practical applications, as they make possible to know at each time the precision of the estimation.

Mathematically, two Luenberger observers can be used, if formula_116 is properly selected, using, for example, positive systems properties: one for the upper bound formula_154 (that ensures that formula_155 converges to zero from above when formula_14, in the absence of noise and uncertainty), and a lower bound formula_157 (that ensures that formula_158 converges to zero from below). That is, always formula_159

<text>Parashakti (IAST: Paraśakti, Sanskrit: पराशक्ति) or Parā is one of the three chief goddesses in Trika system of Kashmir Shaivism along with Aparā and Parparā. In Siddhantic perspective, Parashakti is the counterpart of Paramshiva. Paramshiva is used to describe the ultimate form of Shiva in Shaiva Siddhanta and Kashmiri Shaivism. Parashakti is the power of this primordial Shiva, who is emanated by Paramshiva. Adi Parashakti is used to describe the Divine Mother (Supreme Feminine Energy/Mother of whole creation) in Hindu scriptures. Parashakti is an all-pervasive, pure consciousness, power, and primal substance of all that exists and it has Mahamaya-form, unlike Parashiva which is formless. A Parashakti as the supreme being of puranic Shaktism and of Sri Vidya obtained the name &quot;Adi Parashakti&quot; and Maheshvari-Devi.

== Parā in Trika ==

Trika is a Non-Saiddhantic Mantra Margic Saivite sect that praises Parā, Aparā, and Parāparā as three supreme goddesses. These three represent the three prongs of Shiva&#x27;s Trishula and they can be meditated upon in the Trishulabja Mandala. The three aspects emerge from Kulesvari Matrrusadbhava. Para means the highest form, beyond the range of human understanding. When it loses its transcendence and manifests, it becomes &quot;Parapara&quot;, the mediocre level. When it further loses its strength, it becomes Apara. These three aspects symbolize Shiva, Shakti and Atman in the philosophical perspective of Trika.

== Para in Siddhanta ==

According to Saiva Siddhanta, the lower part (pedestal) of Shiva lingam represents parashakti while upper part (oval stone) represents parashiva.

<doc id="1261188" wikidata="Q747526" url="?curid=1261188" title="The College Dropout">
<text>The College Dropout is the debut studio album by the American rapper Kanye West. It was released on February 10, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. In the years leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.

The production of &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was primarily handled by West and showcased his &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; musical style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&amp;B records, in addition to West&#x27;s own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip-hop, West&#x27;s lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.

&quot;The College Dropout&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a large-scale commercial success, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014 and was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020. The album was promoted with singles such as &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, and &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; becoming West&#x27;s first number-one single as a lead artist.

A widespread critical success, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was praised for West&#x27;s production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music&#x27;s balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. The album earned the rapper several accolades, including nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the 2005 Grammy Awards, winning for the latter. It has since been named by numerous publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, who ranked it at 74 and 273 respectively on their &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; lists, and is credited for popularizing the chipmunk soul and conscious rap subgenres in the 2000s.

== Background ==
Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records. For a time, he acted as a ghost producer for Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie. Due to his association with D-Dot, West was unable to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar. The group released their first and only studio album &quot;World Record Holders&quot; in 1999. West came to achieve recognition with his contributions to Jay-Z&#x27;s influential 2001 album &quot;The Blueprint&quot;. &quot;The Blueprint&quot; has been named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the 50th greatest album of all time, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cam&#x27;ron. He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson.

Although he had attained success as a producer, Kanye West aspired to be a rapper, but had struggled to attain a record deal. Record companies ignored him because he did not portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip-hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal. According to Capitol Records&#x27;s A&amp;R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol&#x27;s president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z, West&#x27;s colleague and one of his mentors, later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.

West&#x27;s breakthrough came a year later on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell asleep at the wheel and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to a hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, expressed West&#x27;s experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West &quot;all the better artists have expressed what they were going through&quot;. West added that &quot;the album was my medicine&quot;, as working on the record distracted him from the pain. &quot;Through the Wire&quot; was first available on West&#x27;s &quot;Get Well Soon...&quot; mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, whose overall theme was to &quot;make your own decisions. Don&#x27;t let society tell you, &#x27;This is what you have to do.&#x27;&quot;

== Recording ==
West began recording &quot;The College Dropout&quot; in 1999, taking four years to complete. Recording sessions took place at Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, but the production featured on the record took place elsewhere over the course of several years. According to John Monopoly, West&#x27;s friend, manager and business partner, the album &quot;...[didn&#x27;t have] a particular start date. He&#x27;s been gathering beats for years. He was always producing with the intention of being a rapper. There&#x27;s beats on the album he&#x27;s been literally saving for himself for years&quot;. At one point, West hovered between making a portion of the production in the studio and the majority within his own apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. Because it was a two-bedroom apartment, West was able to set up a home studio in one of the rooms and his bedroom in the other.

West brought a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio, producing tracks in less than fifteen minutes at a time. He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date. However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them &quot;Keep the Receipt&quot; with Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; with Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming and new verses. On his personal blog in 2009, West stated he was most inspired by &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and listened to the album every day while working on &quot;The College Dropout&quot;.

The song &quot;School Spirit&quot; was censored for the album because Aretha Franklin would not allow the rapper to sample her music without censorship being promised. It was revealed by Plain Pat that there were around three other versions of the song, but West disliked them. Pat said in reference to the Franklin sample: &quot;That song would have been so weak if we didn&#x27;t get that sample cleared&quot;. In 2011, an uncensored version of the track was distributed online.

West finished recording around December 2003, according to his older cousin and singer Tony Williams, who was recruited by the rapper two weeks before the album&#x27;s deadline to contribute vocals. Williams had impressed West by singing improvisations to &quot;Spaceship&quot; during one of their drives together. The singer later recounted recording with West for &quot;The College Dropout&quot; at the Record Plant: &quot;I get in, go in the booth, start vibing out on &#x27;Spaceship&#x27; and finished it up. At that point he was like, &#x27;Ok, Well let me see what you do on this song.&#x27; I think that&#x27;s when we did &#x27;Last Call.&#x27; One song lead to another, and by the end of the weekend, I was on like five songs. Then we did the &#x27;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&#x27; joint&quot;. In a January 2020 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, West revealed that around 30 to 40 percent of the album was recorded on a Roland VS-1680.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;The College Dropout&quot; diverged from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip-hop in favor of more diverse, topical subjects for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, &quot;Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn&#x27;t believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap&quot;. West explained, &quot;My persona is that I&#x27;m the regular person. Just think about whatever you&#x27;ve been through in the past week, and I have a song about that on my album&quot;. The album was musically notable for West&#x27;s unique development of his &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; production style, in which R&amp;B and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.
The album begins with a skit featuring a college professor asking West to deliver a graduation speech. The skit is followed by &quot;We Don&#x27;t Care&quot; featuring West comically celebrating drug life with lines like &quot;We wasn&#x27;t supposed to make it past 25, joke&#x27;s on you, we still alive&quot; and then criticizing its influence amongst children. The next track, &quot;Graduation Day&quot;, features Miri Ben-Ari on violin and vocals by John Legend.

On &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, West wages an attack on consumerism. The song features singer Syleena Johnson and contains an interpolation of Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;Mystery of Iniquity&quot;. West called upon Johnson to re-sing a vocal portion of &quot;Mystery of Iniquity&quot;, which ended up in the final mix. Gospel hymn with doo-wop elements &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; precedes &quot;Spaceship&quot;, a track with a relaxed beat containing a soulful Marvin Gaye sample. The lyrics are mostly critical of the working world, where West muses about flying away in a spaceship to leave his boring job, and guest rappers GLC and Consequence compare the modern-day retail environment to slavery.

On &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, West professes his belief in Jesus, while also discussing how religion is used by various people and how the media seems to avoid songs that address matters of faith while embracing compositions on violence, sex, and drugs. &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is built around a sample of &quot;Walk With Me&quot; as performed by the ARC Choir. Garry Mulholland of &quot;The Observer&quot; described it as a &quot;towering inferno of martial beats, fathoms-deep chain gang backing chants, a defiant children&#x27;s choir, gospel wails, and sizzling orchestral breaks&quot;. The first verse of the song is told through the eyes of a drug dealer seeking help from God, and it reportedly took over six months for West to draw inspiration for the second verse.

&quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; is influenced by West&#x27;s near-death car crash. The song features Jay-Z, who rhymes about maintaining status and power given his chart success, while West comments on racism and poverty. The song features verses by spoken word performer J. Ivy who offers comments of upliftment. &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; reuses a Jay-Z verse first heard in the remix of his song &quot;Hovi Baby&quot;. &quot;Get Em High&quot; is a collaboration by West with two socially conscious rappers, Talib Kweli and Common. &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; is a call to fitness to improve one&#x27;s love life. &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; features Twista and Jamie Foxx and serves as a tribute to classic smooth soul artists and slow jam songs. The song also appeared on Twista&#x27;s album &quot;Kamikaze&quot;. On the song &quot;School Spirit&quot;, West relates the experience of dropping out of school and contains references to well-known fraternities, sororities, singer Norah Jones, and record label Roc-A-Fella Records. &quot;Two Words&quot; features commentary on social issues and features Mos Def, Freeway, and the Harlem Boys Choir.

&quot;Through the Wire&quot; features a high-pitched vocal sample of Chaka Khan and relates West&#x27;s real life experience with being in a car accident. The song provides a mostly comedic account of his difficult recovery, and features West rapping with his jaw still wired shut from the accident. The chorus and instrumentals sample a pitched up version of Chaka Khan&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Through the Fire&quot;. &quot;Family Business&quot; is a soulful tribute to the godbrother of Tarrey Torae, one of the many collaborators in the album. The song &quot;Last Call&quot; is about West&#x27;s transition from being a producer to a rapper, and the album ends with a nearly nine-minute autobiographical monologue that follows the song &quot;Last Call&quot;. However, this is not a separate track.

== Title and packaging ==

The album&#x27;s title is in part a reference to West&#x27;s decision to drop out of college to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. This action greatly displeased his mother, who was a professor at the university from which he withdrew. She later said, &quot;It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don&#x27;t require college. For Kanye to make an album called &quot;[The] College Dropout&quot; it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you&quot;.

The artwork for the album was developed by Eric Duvauchelle, who was then part of Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s in-house brand design team. West had already taken pictures dressed as the Dropout Bear – which would reappear in his later work – and Duvauchelle picked the image of him sitting on a set of bleachers, as he was attracted to the loneliness of what was supposed to be &quot;the most popular representation of a school&quot;. The image is framed inside gold ornaments, which Duvauchelle found in a book of illustrations from the 16th-century and West wanted to use to &quot;bring a sense of elegance and style to what was typically a gangster-led image of rap artists&quot;. The inside cover follows a college yearbook, with photos of the featured artists from their youth.

While the original release of the album features a brown background on the cover artwork, later remasters of the album feature a white background.

== Marketing and sales ==
&quot;The College Dropout&quot; was originally scheduled for release in August 2003, but West&#x27;s perfectionist habits producing the album led to it being postponed three times. It was first delayed to October 2003, then to January 2004, before finally being released to stores on February 10, 2004.

In its first week of release, the album sold 441,000 copies and debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, being held off the top spot by Norah Jones&#x27; second studio album &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;. &quot;The College Dropout&quot; remained at the second spot behind &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; for two consecutive weeks, with 196,000 units sold in the second week and 132,000 in the third week, respectively. In 2004, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; ranked as the twelfth most popular of the year on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album had sold 2.3 million units in the United States by November 2004. By June 2014, the album had become West&#x27;s best-selling album in the US at the time, with domestic sales of 3,358,000 copies. On November 23, 2020, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On the UK Albums Chart, the album peaked at number 12, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had certified it double platinum by November 25, 2004; this indicated shipments of 600,000 copies. As of 2018, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; is the fourteenth highest selling rap album in the UK in the 21st-century. The album has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.

Four of the singles released in promotion of the album became top-20 chart hits: &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; was the fifth and last single. &quot;Spaceship&quot; was planned to be the sixth single, but Def Jam decided to move on from &quot;The College Dropout&quot;″s promotional campaign to begin marketing West&#x27;s next album, &quot;Late Registration&quot; (2005). At one point, &quot;Two Words&quot; was also intended to be released as a single, and a video for the song was filmed, and later uploaded by West online in 2009.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;The College Dropout&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The record was hailed by Kelefa Sanneh from &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;2004&#x27;s first great hip-hop album&quot;. Reviewing it for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin observed in the music &quot;substance, social commentary, righteous anger, ornery humanism, dark humor, and even Christianity&quot;, calling it &quot;one of those wonderful crossover albums that appeal to a huge audience without sacrificing a shred of integrity&quot;. The staff of &quot;Mojo&quot; said its exceptional hip-hop production was miraculous during a time when hip-hop&#x27;s practice of sampling was becoming &quot;increasingly litigious&quot;, and those of &quot;Urb&quot; deemed it &quot;both visceral and emotive, sprinkling the dancefloors with tears and sweat&quot;. Dave Heaton from &quot;PopMatters&quot; found it &quot;musically engaging&quot; and &quot;a genuine extension of Kanye&#x27;s personality and experiences&quot;, while Hua Hsu of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt that his sped-up samples &quot;carry a humble, human air&quot;, allowing listeners to &quot;hear tiny traces of actual people inside&quot;. Fellow &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;not only does [West] create a unique role model, that role model is dangerous—his arguments against education are as market-targeted as other rappers&#x27; arguments for thug life&quot;. In the opinion of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Josh Love, West &quot;subverts cliches from both sides of the hip-hop divide&quot; while &quot;trying to reflect the entire spectrum of hip-hop and black experience, looking for solace and salvation in the traditional safehouses of church and family&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Michael Endelman elaborated on West&#x27;s avoidance of the then-dominant &quot;gangsta&quot; persona of hip-hop:

Some reviewers were more qualified in their praise. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Caramanica felt that &quot;West isn&#x27;t quite MC enough to hold down the entire disc&quot;, though claimed that West&#x27;s &quot;ace in the hole is his signature cozy sound&quot;, while &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani observed &quot;too many guest artists, too many interludes, and just too many songs period&quot; on what he considered a &quot;chest-beatingly self-congratulatory&quot; yet humorous, deeply sincere, and affecting record. It was regarded by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Rob Mitchum as a &quot;flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album&quot;. The staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; were more receptive in a retrospective review than Caramanica was previously for the publication, calling the album &quot;a demonstration that hip-hop—real, banging, commercial hip-hop—could be a vehicle for nuanced self-examination and musical subtlety&quot;.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;The College Dropout&quot; was voted as the best album of the year by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics. The album elsewhere topped year-end lists by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, and &quot;PopMatters&quot;. Dutch magazine &quot;OOR&quot; named it the seventh best album of 2004. &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;The College Dropout&quot; the second best album of 2004. Rhapsody named it the seventh best album of the decade and the fourth best hip-hop album of the decade.

In 2005, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it No. 50 in their best albums of 2000–2004. In 2006, the album was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In its retrospective 2007 issue, &quot;XXL&quot; named it one of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;XXL&quot;-rated releases; this perfect rating had previously been given by the magazine to only sixteen other albums. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; named the album one of the classic albums of the last decade, and the 20th best hip-hop debut album ever. &quot;Dagsavisen&quot; listed the album eleventh in its list of the top forty albums of the 2000s decade. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at 273 on its 2013 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at 74 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2020.

=== Industry awards ===
== Influence ==
&quot;The College Dropout&quot; sparked a resurgence of socially conscious rap in the mid-2000s, arriving at a time when pop rap was saturated with songs featuring product placement and intensely violent lyrics, epitomized by rappers like 50 Cent, Nelly, Ja Rule, Ludacris, and P. Diddy. West instead created a space in the mainstream for rappers to express themselves and black identity without resorting to hip-hop&#x27;s prevalent theme of gang culture. Raul Verma of &quot;The Independent&quot; said &quot;West is charged with proving mainstream hip hop has a conscience with his nourishing messages of substance flying in the face of the amoral majority perpetuating clichés of guns, girls and bling&quot;, while &quot;Vibe&quot; senior editor Noah Callahan-Bever argued that West&#x27;s infusion of &quot;pop sensibility&quot; into his otherwise progressive hip-hop had &quot;bridged the gap&quot; and encouraged rappers to gravitate more towards the center between mainstream and alternative forms. &quot;Today&quot; commented that &quot;The College Dropout&quot; &quot;stood out in the rap landscape because of its atypical prose. It avoided the usual plotlines about sex, money and violence and touched on everything from his faith to his fears of failure and other crises from his life.&quot;

According to &quot;DJBooth&quot; journalist Brad Callas, the album also &quot;helped solidify chipmunk soul as not only the defining sound of the Roc-A-Fella era but also the most popular sub-genre in hip-hop&quot;. &quot;It feels like that album birthed an entire sub-genre&quot;, Max Weinstein wrote in retrospect for &quot;Vibe&quot;, going on to say, &quot;The palette of emotions was so broad, the depth of topics so searingly relevant, that it was bound to make an impression on any artist that heard it. RZA might have birthed chipmunk soul, and Black Star perfected smart lyricism for the JanSport bunch, but &#x27;Ye brought all that to the masses in one single, digestible product, breaking down the divisions between mainstream rap and Rawkus-grade consciousness.&quot; Weinstein also credited &quot;The College Dropout&quot; with directly influencing 10 albums: &quot;Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s Food &amp; Liquor&quot; (2006) by Lupe Fiasco, &quot;School Was My Hustle&quot; (2006) by Kidz in the Hall, &quot;Don&#x27;t Quit Your Day Job!&quot; (2007) by Consequence, &quot;A Kid Named Cudi&quot; (2008) by Kid Cudi, &quot;Asleep in the Bread Aisle&quot; (2009) by Asher Roth, Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s self-titled first EP (2009), &quot;Camp&quot; (2011) by Childish Gambino, &quot;Cole World: The Sideline Story&quot; (2011) by J. Cole, &quot;When Fish Ride Bicycles&quot; (2011) by The Cool Kids, and &quot;Acid Rap&quot; (2013) by Chance the Rapper.

With the album, West began to develop a following of listeners who could not relate to lyrics glorifying gangster lifestyle but still enjoyed rap music and connected more with his musings on family and love. In 2005, comedian Chris Rock attested to listening to &quot;The College Dropout&quot; while writing his stand-up material. Music journalists such as Meaghan Garvey, Andrew Barber, and Erika Ramirez also connected to the album during their formative years, with Barber saying in a roundtable discussion for &quot;Noisey&quot;, &quot;I could identify with this project the most because I was in college at the time, and I felt like an underdog in my own life. I was uncertain of my future. [West&#x27;s] words on &#x27;Last Call&#x27; inspired me to follow my dreams, and motivated me to graduate despite the album title.&quot; In the same discussion, music journalist Eric Sundermann cited &quot;The College Dropout&quot; as the first in West&#x27;s pop rap album trilogy that would be followed by &quot;Late Registration&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Graduation&quot; in 2007, while Craig Jenkins called it &quot;a watershed moment in 2000s rap history where the nerds stormed the school to seize control from the jocks, a shift memorialized two albums later when &quot;Graduation&quot; trounced 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Curtis&quot; album in their 2007 sales showdown.&quot;

<text>Parashiva (or Paramashiva, Paramshiva, or Parmshiva, among other spellings; Sanskrit: परशिव, IAST: Paraśiva) is the highest aspect of Shiva in Shaiva Siddhanta and in Kashmir Shaivism. Below him are the primordial Shiva with the Parashakti and Sadashiva with seven Shaktis.

==Shaiva Siddhanta==

According to the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, which is a major school of Shaivism, Parashiva is absolute reality which is beyond human comprehension and is beyond all attributes. According to Mahamahopadhaya Gopinath Kaviraj, in this aspect Shiva is both formless and with forms. He is beyond both dvaita and advaita. In Shaivite theology, Parashiva is both the source and the destination of everything in the existence. 

According to the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, the other two aspects of Shiva are Parashakti and Parameshwara.

The upper part (oval stone) of Shiva Lingam represents Parashiva while lower part (pedestal) represents Parashakti. Parashiva is beyond all of the 36 tattvas mentioned in Shaivism philosophy.

== Kashmir Shaivism ==
Kashmiri Shaivism describes how all of reality, with all of its diversity and fluctuation, is the play of the single principle, Paramashiva. The two aspects of this single reality are inseparably united: Shiva and Shakti. Paramashiva &quot;appears&quot; as the world through his creative power, Shakti. The ontological nature of Paramashiva is beyond human knowledge and articulation, yet it can be experienced directly through mystical intuition.

The Kashmir Shaivism tradition, also called Trika Shaivism, is a non-dualist branch of Shaiva-Shakta Tantra Hinduism that originated in Kashmir after 850 CE. In its place of origin in Kashmir, this tradition is commonly referred to as &quot;&quot;Kashmiri Shaivism&quot;.&quot; It later spread beyond Kashmir, with its great scholar Abhinavagupta calling it &quot;Trika&quot; (meaning &quot;the Trinity&quot;). It particularly flourished in the states of Odisha and Maharashtra. Defining features of the Trika tradition are its idealistic and monistic &quot;Pratyabhijna&quot; (&quot;Recognition&quot;) philosophical system, propounded by Utpaladeva (c. 925–975 CE) and Abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025 CE), and the centrality of the three goddesses Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā.

<text>The Rabbit River is a tributary of the Kalamazoo River within Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The river&#x27;s watershed covers of land and drains most of north-central and northeast Allegan County as well as small portions of Barry, Kent and Ottawa counties.

The river rises in farmland in the southeast portion of Leighton Township and flows generally westward, traversing the northern portion of Wayland Township, the city of Wayland, the northern portion of Hopkins Township, the extreme southwest corner of Dorr Township, Salem Township, Overisel Township, Heath Township, Hamilton, and Manlius Township, where it merges with the Kalamazoo near New Richmond.

== Tributaries ==
Main tributaries are (from east to west):
*Green Lake Creek
*Buskirk Creek
*Miller Creek (Hopkins Township)
*Bear Creek
*Little Rabbit River
*Black Creek
*Miller Creek (Monterey Township)
*Silver Creek

The Little Rabbit River is an tributary of the Rabbit River, with a watershed that drains sections of four townships in Allegan and Kent counties: Byron Township in Kent County, and Leighton, Dorr and Salem townships in Allegan County. The upper reaches consist of two small branches: the Red Run Drain, which rises in the extreme western edge of Leighton Township just north of Moline and the Dorr &amp; Byron Drain, which rises in the southern portion of Byron Township. The branches converge west of Dorr and then empty into the Rabbit River in southwest Salem Township.

<text>The Poznań Society of Friends of Learning or Poznań Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences (, &quot;PTPN&quot;) is a learned society in Poznań, Poland, established in 1857, by scholars and scientists in all branches of learning. It has been one of the largest and most important general learned organizations in Poland.

When founded in the 19th century, the Poznań Society was the chief Polish scientific and cultural organization in Prussian Poland, and until the creation of Kraków&#x27;s Academy of Learning (&quot;Akademia Umiejętności&quot;) in 1871–73 it was the most important learned society in all the Polish lands. In addition to its learned activities, the Society collected and secured art works and Polish national mementos.

In 1919 the Society initiated the founding of University of Poznań (currently Adam Mickiewicz University).

<text>In Dvaita theology, Mukti-yogyas are a class of souls classified by Shri Madhvacharya as eligible for mukti or moksha. Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualifies for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), another as subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell Andhatamisra (Tamo-yogyas).

Mukti-yogyas are Jivas or souls who are receptive to spiritual values, and through repeated embodiments, they evolve into better and better people, and finally through concentrated spiritual discipline and God&#x27;s grace attain salvation.

<text>Pascal Robert Boyer is a Franco-American cognitive anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist, mostly known for his work in the cognitive science of religion. He studied at université Paris-Nanterre and Cambridge, and taught at the University of Cambridge for eight years, before taking up the position of Henry Luce Professor of Individual and Collective Memory at Washington University in St. Louis, where he teaches classes on evolutionary psychology and anthropology. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Lyon, France. He studied philosophy and anthropology at University of Paris and Cambridge, with Jack Goody, working on memory constraints on the transmission of oral literature. Boyer is a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Work==
Pascal Boyer, an anthropologist of French origin, studies how human biases and cognitive faculties have resulted in or encouraged cultural phenomena. He advocates the idea that human evolution resulted in specialized capacities that guide our social relations, culture, and s toward religious beliefs. Boyer and others propose that these cognitive mechanisms make the acquisition of “religious” themes, like concepts of spirits, ghosts, ancestors or gods, highly transmissible within a community.

Boyer has conducted long-term ethnographic fieldwork in Cameroon, where he studied the transmission of Fang oral epics and its traditional religion. Most of his later work consists of an experimental study of cognitive capacities underlying cultural transmission. He also conducted studies on supernatural concepts and their retention in memory and a general description of cognitive processes involved in the transmission of religious concepts. More recently, he has written on the concept of Folk economics, which proposes that evolved cognitive biases play an important role in how laypeople view the economy.

== &quot;Religion Explained&quot; ==
Of Boyer&#x27;s books, &quot;Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought&quot; is the best known. Boyer introduced cognitive anthropology, which provided a new understanding of religion. Religion for Boyer consists of cultural representations, that is, ideas that appear in roughly similar forms in the minds of different individuals in a group. To explain how religion emerges and is transmitted, we must explain how these ideas are acquired, stored and transmitted better than other possible ideas. Findings from cognitive and developmental psychology suggest that some combinations of ideas are particularly easy to acquire and remember. Among these, we find many standard themes of supernatural and religious imagination, such as the notion of an agent with counter-intuitive physics and standard psychology, e.g. ghosts and gods that are not material but have the same mental capacities as humans. According to Boyer, there are only a few such combinations of intuitive and counter-intuitive material that are optimal for acquisition and memory - and these happen to be the most frequent ones in the world&#x27;s religions.

In this cognitive paradigm belief in &quot;supernatural agents&quot; is natural and part of human cognition. However, religion is not &quot;special&quot;. That is, there are no specific mental systems that create religious ideas. Rather, these ideas are an expected by-product of mental systems that evolved for other reasons, not for religion. For instance, we easily entertain the notion of a &quot;god&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot; because of our intuitive psychology, what psychologists sometimes call &quot;Theory of Mind&quot;. 

Justin L. Barrett has argued that Boyer’s book, &quot;The Naturalness of Religious Ideas: A Cognitive Theory of Religion&quot; is an attempt to reform traditional models and allow understanding religion in terms of cognitive science. Boyer dismantles many traditional assumptions of cultural studies. However, Barrett claims, Boyer lacks clarity – mostly due to the shift in anthropological to psychological jargon.

== &quot;Minds Make Societies&quot; ==
In this book, Boyer explains the relevance of evolutionary psychology and cultural evolution to understanding human societies, from the small-scale communities in which humans evolved to modern mass-societies. The blurb states that the book &quot;integrates insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and more to explore the development and workings of human societies&quot;.

In Boyer&#x27;s view, this new integrated social science can provide new answers, based on scientific evidence, to important questions about society. Each of the six chapters in the book focuses on one of these questions: (1) Why do humans favor their own group?, (2) Why do people communicate so much wrong information (rumors, superstition, etc.)?, (3) Why are there religions?, (4) What is the natural family?, (5) How can societies be just? and (6) Can human minds understand human societies?

One running theme in the book is that social sciences can progress if they abandon &quot;chimerical&quot; notions like &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;culture&quot;, that do not correspond to anything in the world, and rather consider how the particular history of natural selection in the human line resulted in specific preferences and capacities. Social scientists should also abandon classical assumptions that name problems instead of solving them, like the idea that power is similar to a force, or that social norms exist outside the heads of human beings. 

Boyer recommends the kind of &quot;consilient&quot; social science outlined by E. O. Wilson, and he argues that we already have the elements of such a social science, as illustrated in his book.

<text>Naucratis or Naukratis (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Naval Command&quot;; Egyptian: , , , Coptic: ) was a city and trading-post in ancient Egypt, located on the Canopic (western-most) branch of the Nile river, south-east of the Mediterranean sea and the city of Alexandria. Naucratis was the first and, for much of its early history, the only permanent Greek settlement in Egypt, serving as a symbiotic nexus for the interchange of Greek and Egyptian art and culture.

The modern villages of Kom Gi&#x27;eif, el-Nibeira and el-Niqrash cover the archaeological site, which is of great importance. It is the source of numerous art objects in many of the world&#x27;s museums, as well as pottery inscribed with some of the earliest known examples of Greek writing.

The sister port of Naucratis was the harbour town of Heracleion, which was discovered in 2000.

==Background==
Archaeological evidence suggests that the history of the ancient Greeks in Egypt dates back at least to Mycenaean times (1600–1100 BC) and more likely even further back into the proto-Greek Minoan age. This history is strictly one of commerce as no permanent Greek settlements have been found of these cultures to date.

After the collapse of Mycenaean Greek civilization and the ensuing Greek dark ages (c. 1100–750 BC), a &quot;renaissance&quot; of Greek culture flourished in the 7th century BC—with it came renewed contact with the East and its two great river civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile.
The first report of Greeks in 7th century BC Egypt is a story in the Histories of Herodotus of Ionian and Carian pirates forced by storm to land on or near the Nile Delta. It relates the plight of the Saite Pharaoh Psammetichus I (Psamtik) (c. 664–610) of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt overthrown and in desperation seeking the advice of the Oracle of Leto at Buto, who cryptically advises him to enlist the aid of the &quot;bronze men&quot; who would &quot;come from the sea.&quot; Inspired upon seeing the bronze armor of the shipwrecked pirates, he offers them rewards in return for their aid in his campaign of return to power. Upon the success of this endeavor, he makes good on his word and bestows on the mercenaries two parcels of land (or &quot;camps,&quot; ) on either side of the Pelusian branch of the Nile.

At present these sites remain uncertain but this may be a reference to the city of Daphnae.

==History==
Naukratis was the site of an Egyptian town before the Greeks arrived, later becoming established as a military settlement occupied by mercenaries. Naukratis was located on the Canopic branch of the Nile in the western Delta some 16 km from Sais. The Canopic tributary was one of the major waterways linking the Nile valley with the Mediterranean, and the most accessible of the Nile&#x27;s tributaries during the Saite Period. The early settlement then developed into a busy trading port. They exchanged goods with the Greeks and with other Mediterranean states. Greeks traders settled in Naukratis and a large Greek community began to develop.
===Ancient sources===
In 570 BC, the Pharaoh Apries (Wahibre, reigned 589–570 BC) led the descendants of his mercenary army made up of 30,000 Carians and Ionians against a former general turned rebel by the name of Amasis. Although fighting valiantly, the mercenaries suffered defeat and Amasis II became Pharaoh (reigning 570–526 BC). Amasis shut down the &quot;camps&quot; and moved the Greek soldiers to Memphis where they were employed &quot;to guard him against the native Egyptians.&quot;

Herodotus stated that &quot;Amasis was partial to the Greeks, and among other favors which he granted them, gave to such as liked to settle in Egypt the city of Naucratis for their residence.&quot; Notice that he says &quot;gave the city (),&quot; which seems to indicate the existence (now borne out by archaeological evidence) of a &quot;city&quot; already there. This older city was probably a small settlement inhabited by a mix of native Egyptians, Greeks and possibly even Phoenicians. Thus it seems the city was &quot;chartered&quot; to the Greeks soon after 570 BC. The earlier date of c. 625 BC put forward by archaeologists may be the original establishment of a settlement at the site.

Amasis indeed converted Naucratis into a major treaty-port and commercial link with the west. This was done most likely as a means to contain Greeks activities in one place under his control. It became not the colony of any particular city-state but an open emporion (trading post) similar to Al Mina in north Syria.

According to Herodotus the walled shrine known as the &quot;Hellenion&quot; was a co-operative enterprise financed by nine eastern Greek cities:
*Four Ionian: Chios, Klazomenai, Teos and Phocaea;
*Four Dorian: Rhodes, Halicarnassus, Knidos and Phaselis;
*One Aeolian: Mytilene;
*Miletus, Samos and Aegina also had their own sanctuaries. 
Thus the natives of at least twelve Greek city-states worked in a rare long-term collaboration.

Naucratis later became an important center of Greek culture under the Roman Empire, producing several celebrated orators of the Second Sophistic in the second and early third centuries AD. The third century writer Athenaeus came from Naucratis. In the Deipnosophistae, he writes that in Naucratis the people dine in the Prytaneion on the natal day of the Hestia Prytanitis (). 

==Archaeology==


The site was discovered by Flinders Petrie who dug there in 1884–1885. He was followed by Ernest Arthur Gardner and finally David George Hogarth, in 1899 and 1903. Hogarth was assisted in the 1903 dig by Campbell Cowan Edgar.

The archaeological focus fell into two areas of northern and southern quarters. Found farthest south was a large Egyptian storehouse or treasury (A on sketch at right—originally identified by Petrie as the &quot;great temenos&quot;) and just north of that a Greek mud-brick Temple of Aphrodite roughly 14 m × 8 m (curiously not mentioned in Herodotus&#x27; list.) Directly east of this temple was unearthed a small factory for faience scarab seals.

In the northern section were found several temple ruins (E: Temple of Hera, F: Temple of Apollo &amp; G: Temple of Dioscuri) including what may be Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Hellenion&quot; discovered by Hogarth in 1899 (directly east of F). &quot;None of the votive pottery found here need have arrived earlier than the reign of Amasis, so it may well be that the &quot;Hellenion&quot; was founded as the result of his reorganization of the status of Naucratis, while the independent sanctuaries ... are of the earlier years of the town.&quot;

More recently American archaeologists W. Coulson and A. Leonard founded &quot;The Naucratis Project&quot; in 1977 carrying out surveys in 1977–1978 and further surveys and excavations to the south of the site from 1980–1982 (under the auspices of the American Research Center in Egypt). Unfortunately they found the original northern sanctuary section submerged under a lake formed by the risen water table and roughly 15 m deep. This part of the site remains under water today, making further work there difficult if not impossible. Their assessment of the approach taken and methods used by their predecessors was less than complimentary. &quot;Unfortunately, much of the emphasis of the early excavators was placed on these religious structures at the expense of the commercial and domestic quarters. Consequently our knowledge of the mercantile character of ancient Naukratis—the very facet of its early history that made it so exceptional—has suffered greatly. Furthermore, the later historical sequences, such as the Hellenistic and Roman periods, were almost totally neglected.&quot; Also discouraging to them was the destruction wrought by the local populace on the site. &quot;Already in Petrie&#x27;s day about a third of the half-mile by quarter-mile site of Naukratis had been dug away by the local farmers for use as high-phosphate fertilizer (&quot;sebakh&quot;) in their fields... In the intervening 100 years or so, the &quot;sebakhin&quot; have totally destroyed this eastern portion of the site.&quot; The barrier of the high water table made it impossible for them to find anything older than the Ptolemaic era. They agreed with Hogarth that the &quot;great temenos&quot; of Petrie was actually an Egyptian building and that indeed the entire south section of the town appeared to be non-Greek. Overall most of the finds were vases (some whole, most fragmentary) used as votives in the temples, but also perfume flasks (several in the form of a hedgehog) and stone statuettes and scarab seals. These are scattered to museums and collections around the world, the earlier material largely brought to Britain (mostly in the British Museum) and the latter to the Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria.

==Impact==
The Egyptians supplied the Greeks with mostly grain but also linen and papyrus while the Greeks bartered mostly silver but also timber, olive oil and wine. Naukratis, and the associated Greek &quot;forts&quot; in the general delta area, as demonstrated by accounts given above, became a ready source of mercenary fighting men for the Saite pharaohs, men with superior hoplite armor and tactics, also possessing invaluable naval expertise.

Naucratis soon became a profound source of inspiration to the Greeks by re-exposing them to the wonders of Egyptian architecture and sculpture lost to them since the Bronze Age. Egyptian artifacts soon began their flow along the Greek trade routes finding their way into the homes and workshops of the Ionian Greek world and, via Aegina, the city-states of mainland Greece. Although Greek art and ideas in turn came back the other way their absorption into a largely xenophobic Egyptian culture was strictly minimal.

Although Herodotus claimed that geometry () was first known in Egypt and then passed into Greece, it is now generally accepted by scholars that what the Greeks learned were more like &quot;surveying techniques&quot; and hardly deserve the designation &quot;geometry&quot; in the sense of a purely intellectual mathematical practice. Indeed, Greeks like Thales were already accomplished geometricians before their travel to Egypt and very likely Herodotus assumed that because the Egyptian was older, the Greeks must have got it from there.

In terms of our modern understanding of the Greeks, and in particular the early use of their nascent Greek alphabet, the finds of Naucratis have turned out to be foundational. &quot;The inscriptions on the pottery have yielded what Mr. Ernest Gardner considers—apparently on firm grounds—to be the oldest Ionic inscriptions, as well as some in the Korinthian, Melian, and Lesbian alphabets.&quot; Of particular interest are the several examples of an evolutionary variation from the original Phoenician alphabetic script. Much has also been learned by comparing these alphabets with the forms they assumed a century later, forms that were destined to become universal across the Hellenic world.

Naucratis was not only the first Greek settlement in Egypt but also Egypt&#x27;s most important harbor in antiquity until the rise of Alexandria and the shifting of the Nile led to its decline. Nevertheless, the ancient city of Heracleion/Thonis also rivalled Naucratis as an important port city of Egypt, especially from the 6th to the 4th century BC.

<doc id="1261234" wikidata="Q229021" url="?curid=1261234" title="Tricia Helfer">
<text>Tricia Janine Helfer (born April 11, 1974) is a Canadian actress and former model. She is known for portraying Number Six in the science fiction series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004–2009). She also voiced Sarah Kerrigan in the video game &quot;StarCraft II&quot; and its expansion packs (2010–2015), and portrayed Charlotte Richards/Goddess in the urban fantasy series &quot;Lucifer&quot; (2016–2021).

==Early life==
Helfer was born in rural Donalda, Alberta, Canada, to Dennis and Elaine Helfer. 

She studied at William E. Hay Composite High School in Stettler, Alberta. She lived and worked on the family&#x27;s grain farm with her three sisters: Trena, Tammy, and Tara.

Helfer was discovered at age 17 by a modeling agency scout while standing in line at a movie theatre.

==Career==

===Modeling===

In 1992, she won Ford Models&#x27; Supermodel of the World contest. Helfer retired from fashion modelling in 2002 and claimed all her shoots since then are related to projects or product endorsements. She has appeared in ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Versace, Chanel, and Giorgio Armani.

Helfer has walked for top fashion shows, such as Carolina Herrera, Christian Dior, Claude Montana, Givenchy, John Galliano, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Helfer has appeared on the covers of &quot;Flare&quot;, &quot;Amica&quot;, &quot;ELLE&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, and &quot;Vogue&quot;, among others. She also regularly appeared in photo shoots by &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, was the magazine&#x27;s wall calendar girl for 2005, and was ranked #57 on the &quot;Maxim&quot;″s Hot 100 Women of 2007. Helfer was also featured as the cover model for the February 2007 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

===Acting===
Helfer relocated to Los Angeles in 2002 to pursue a full-time acting career. Her first acting assignment was a co-starring role as Sarah on the television series &quot;Jeremiah&quot;. She later played a model named Ashleigh James on the May 16, 2002 episode of &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Hunger Artist&quot;). In 2002, she played Eva in the independent film &quot;White Rush&quot;.

In 2003, she played Number Six on &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. In 2004, she portrayed Farrah Fawcett in the telefilm &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Concurrent with her role in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, Helfer began producing and hosting &quot;Canada&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; on May 31, 2006. She appeared in &quot;Spiral&quot; and &quot;The Green Chain&quot; later the same year.

In October 2006, it was announced that Helfer would not return to host the second season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; so she could concentrate on &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Helfer also played a major role in Electronic Arts&#x27; video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;, as the high-level Nod general Kilian Qatar, along with her &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; co-star, actress Grace Park. She also starred in the episode &quot;Roadkill&quot; on the second season of &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

Helfer had a recurring role on the CBS sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. She played Gail, best friend of Charlie&#x27;s (Charlie Sheen) fiancée Chelsea (Jennifer Taylor). When Chelsea finds out that her friend is recovering from a breakup, she says she should do so at Charlie&#x27;s house. Shortly after Chelsea and Charlie begin a trial separation, Gail begins a sexual relationship with Charlie.

====&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;====
In 2003, the television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was used as the basis for a three-hour miniseries on the Sci Fi channel. The project was written and produced by Ronald D. Moore and directed by Michael Rymer. Helfer played the role of Number Six, a humanoid Cylon operative. She continued that role as a regular cast member in the TV series, which completed its fourth and final season on March 20, 2009. Due to the special nature of the Number Six character – there are many &quot;copies&quot; of Number Six with distinct personalities – Helfer has, in effect, played numerous roles on the series. In 2009, she reprised her role as Number Six in &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Plan&quot; – a television movie that tells the story of the series from the Cylons&#x27; point of view. In 2012, she voiced a prototype Cylon in the prequel &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome&quot;.

<text>Eriocoma hymenoides (common names: Indian ricegrass and sand rice grass) is a cool-season, perennial bunchgrass. It is native to western North America.

==Description==
In the wild, &quot;Eriocoma hymenoides&quot; typically grows tall and wide. It has narrow, rolled leaf blades. 

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Eriocoma hymenoides&quot; is native to western North America east of the Cascades from British Columbia and Alberta south to southern California, northeastern Mexico, and Texas.

It grows in a variety of habitats from desert scrub to ponderosa pine forests. It can live in sandy to clayey textured soils. It can stabilize shifting sand.

==Cultivation==
Indian ricegrass is an important food for wild grazers such as bison, bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, pronghorns, and jackrabbits. For some of these species, it is especially vital in late winter, as it produces green shoots earlier than other grasses. The seeds are heavily consumed by many rodents and birds. Seed caching rodents may enhance seedling survival and long-term survival of the plant.

Indian ricegrass is preferentially consumed by cattle and is an early casualty of overgrazing.

==Uses==
In the past, the grass was a staple food of Native Americans, especially when the maize crop failed, and for non-agricultural tribes. Seed of the ricegrass was gathered and ground into meal or flour and made into bread. Since 2000, the ricegrass has been cultivated in Montana and marketed under the trade name Montina as a gluten-free grain. The Zuni people used the ground seeds as a staple before the availability of corn.

==In culture==
It was officially recognized as the Nevada state grass in 1977, and as the Utah state grass in 1990.

<text>&quot;Nitya-samsarin&quot;s () or nitya-samsaris is a concept in Hindu philosophy, referring to an individual who believes that their self is eternally bound in the cycle of rebirth called &quot;samsara&quot;. The existence of nitya-samsari is used to offer credibility to the concept of the periodical creation and the dissolution of the universe. 

== Philosophy ==

=== Dvaita ===
The philosopher Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls that qualifies for &quot;moksha&quot; (mukti-yogyas), another as subject to &quot;samsara&quot; (nitya-samsaris), and a third class that is eventually condemned to the hell named Andhatamisra (tamo-yogyas).

=== Vishishtadvaita ===
In the philosophy of Vishishtadvaita, a nitya-samsari is an individual who is described to be bound to their &quot;karma&quot; at all times.

<text>The University of Maine at Farmington (UMaine Farmington or UMF) is a public liberal arts college in Farmington, Maine. It is part of the University of Maine System and a founding member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges.

==History==
In March 1863, a Normal School Act passed into law, and that fall, Farmington was chosen from a list of possible locations for a normal school. Founded in 1864 as the state&#x27;s first publicly funded normal school, the first class graduated from the Western State Normal School in 1866. Over the following hundred years, the school&#x27;s name would change several more times: Northern State Normal School (1878), Farmington State Normal School (1889), Farmington State Teachers College (1945), and Farmington State College (1965). 

Farmington State College was finally merged into the University of Maine System in 1968, initially known as the Farmington State College of the University of Maine, before taking on its current name in 1971. 

Many early graduates attended the school for its liberal arts offerings alone. Among these were the Stanley brothers, famous for building the Stanley Steamer automobile, and John Frank Stevens, engineer of the Panama Canal. Comedian Bob Marley graduated with a degree in community health.

Interest in the liberal arts continued unabated, and the college offered its first degree programs in the liberal arts in 1971. By the 1974–75 school year, nearly 300 students were enrolled in liberal arts majors.

In early 2016, the University of Maine at Farmington Education Center was named in honor of its longtime President Theodora J. Kalikow, who served from 1994 to 2012. Now named the Theodora J. Kalikow Education Center, the LEED-Silver certified building is home to the UMF College of Education, Health and Rehabilitation. The 44,500 square foot building features a geothermal heating and cooling system as well as recycled and sustainable construction materials.

==Athletics==
The UMaine Farmington Beavers compete in the NCAA Division III North Atlantic Conference. The school&#x27;s official colors are maroon, gold, and gray.

UMaine Farmington has 12 NCAA varsity teams, including men&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, and soccer; and women&#x27;s teams in basketball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, softball, and lacrosse. Athletics sponsors varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs in alpine and Nordic skiing and snowboarding that compete through the United States Collegiate Ski &amp; Snowboard Association (USCSA). There are also club teams in cheerleading, ice hockey, men&#x27;s rugby, women&#x27;s rugby, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ultimate disc sport. Recent NAC champions include men&#x27;s cross country (2003–2005), women&#x27;s basketball (2004, 2006, 2007), women&#x27;s cross country (2004–2005), women&#x27;s field hockey (2003–2004, 2006, 2007), women&#x27;s soccer (2003), women&#x27;s softball (2005) and men&#x27;s basketball (2010). Recent NCAA tournament appearances include women&#x27;s basketball (2006), women&#x27;s field hockey (2004, 2006, 2007), women&#x27;s soccer (2003) and women&#x27;s softball (2005). In 2010 the men&#x27;s basketball team advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division III National Tournament.

In addition to the outdoor athletic fields and Dearborn Gymnasium, UMF has a Fitness and Recreation Center that houses a cardio fitness area with machines, a weight room, four multipurpose courts, a 1/8-mile walking/jogging track, and a 25-yard swimming pool for the use of UMF students and members of the area community.

<text>In Dvaita philosophy, Tamo-yogyas are a group of souls, classified by Madhvacharya, which consists of the souls who are damnable. Madhvacharya divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualifies for &quot;moksha&quot;, or liberation (Mukti-yogyas); another as subject to &quot;samsara&quot;, eternal rebirth or transmigration (Nitya-samsarins); and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hellish life in Andhatamisra (Tamo-yogyas).

According to Madhvacharya, Naraka (hell) is temporary for sinners like thieves and drunkards, but not for those who express eternal hatred against God, the Dvaita gurus or the Vedas. Therefore, the eternally damned would consist of the most evil, sadomasochistic living entities, including the demon Kali, who although he carries out the orders of God also enjoys being punished, and who is said to be the most wicked being. They would sink down into Andhatamisra, which would remain independently during every &quot;kalpa&quot;. Some Dvaitins regard this as an expression of universal kindness, because it would fit in with their nature, comparing it to the neem tree, which prefers bitter minerals for its growth.

<doc id="1261255" wikidata="Q1321851" url="?curid=1261255" title="Mode of limited transposition">
<text>Modes of limited transposition are musical modes or scales that fulfill specific criteria relating to their symmetry and the repetition of their interval groups. These scales may be transposed to all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, but at least two of these transpositions must result in the same pitch classes, thus their transpositions are &quot;limited&quot;. They were compiled by the French composer Olivier Messiaen, and published in his book &quot;La technique de mon langage musical&quot; (&quot;The Technique of my Musical Language&quot;).

==Technical criteria==
There are two complementary ways to view the modes: considering their possible transpositions, and considering the different modes contained within them.

===Definition by chromatic transposition===
Transposing the diatonic major scale up in semitones results in a different set of notes being used each time. For example, C major consists of C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and the scale a semitone higher (D major) consists of D, E, F, G, A, B, C. By transposing D major up another semitone, another new set of notes (D major) is produced, and so on, giving 12 different diatonic scales in total. When transposing a mode of limited transposition this is not the case. For example, the mode of limited transposition that Messiaen labelled &quot;Mode 1&quot;, which is the whole tone scale, contains the notes C, D, E, F, G, A; transposing this mode up a semitone produces C, D, F, G, A, B. Transposing this up another semitone produces D, E, F, G, A, C, which is the same set of notes as the original scale. Since transposing the mode up a whole tone produces the same set of notes, mode 1 has only 2 transpositions.

Any scale having 12 different transpositions is not a mode of limited transposition.

===Definition by shifting modal degrees===
Consider the intervals of the major scale: tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone. Starting the scale on a different degree will always create a new mode with individual interval layouts—for example starting on the second degree of a major scale gives the &quot;Dorian mode&quot;—tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone, tone. This is not so of the modes of limited transposition, which can be modally shifted only a limited number of times. For example, mode 1, the whole tone scale, contains the intervals tone, tone, tone, tone, tone, tone. Starting on any degree of the mode gives the same sequence of intervals, and therefore the whole tone scale has only 1 mode. Messiaen&#x27;s mode 2, or the diminished scale, consists of semitone, tone, semitone, tone, semitone, tone, semitone, tone, which can only be arranged 2 ways, starting with either a tone or a semitone. Therefore, mode 2 has two modes.

Any scale having the same number of modes as notes is not a mode of limited transposition.

==Messiaen&#x27;s list==
Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;first mode&quot;, also called the whole-tone scale, is divided into six groups of two notes each. The intervals it contains are tone, tone, tone, tone, tone, tone – it has two transpositions and one mode.


The &quot;second mode&quot;, also called the octatonic, diminished, &quot;whole-half&quot;, or &quot;half-whole&quot; scale, is divided into four groups of three notes each. It contains the intervals semitone, tone, semitone, tone, semitone, tone, semitone, tone – it has three transpositions, like the diminished 7th chord, and two modes:


The &quot;third mode&quot; is divided into three groups of four notes each. It contains the intervals tone, semitone, semitone, tone, semitone, semitone, tone, semitone, semitone – it has four transpositions, like the augmented triad, and three modes.


The &quot;fourth mode&quot; contains the intervals semitone, semitone, minor third, semitone, semitone, semitone, minor third, semitone – it has six transpositions, like the tritone, and four modes.


The &quot;fifth mode&quot; contains the intervals semitone, major third, semitone, semitone, major third, semitone – it has six transpositions, like the tritone, and three modes.


The &quot;sixth mode&quot; has the intervals tone, tone, semitone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, semitone – it has six transpositions, like the tritone, and four modes.


The &quot;seventh mode&quot; contains the intervals semitone, semitone, semitone, tone, semitone, semitone, semitone, semitone, tone, semitone – it has six transpositions, like the tritone, and five modes.


==Expansion and alteration of the modes==
===Are there others?===
Messiaen wrote, &quot;Their series is closed, it is mathematically impossible to find others, at least in our tempered system of 12 semitones.&quot; More modes can be found that fit the criteria, but they are truncations of the original seven modes.
Indeed, all these modes can be regrouped mathematically speaking in a lattice (wherein one set of notes is connected with those containing it). If one excludes modes with 0, 1, 11 or 12 notes which can be construed as too extreme, there are 15 generalized Messiaen modes which are represented on clock diagrams. Some of the ones omitted by Messiaen are arguably of musical importance, like the hexatonic collection 0 1 4 5 8 9.
The augmented scale: 0 3 4 7 8 11 (Root, minor 3rd, major 3rd, 5th, augmented 5th, major 7th, or minor 3rd, semitone, minor 3rd, semitone, minor 3rd, semitone) may appear to be an inexplicable omission on Messiaen&#x27;s part. It is a symmetrical scale used frequently by modern jazz improvisers. However closer inspection reveals it to be a truncated version of his Third Mode.

===Truncation===
Truncation involves the removal of notes from one of the modes to leave a new truncated mode. Both the notes removed and the notes remaining must preserve the symmetry of the parent mode, and must therefore fulfill the conditions for limited transposition. For example, consider mode 1.

*C D E F G A

Removing alternate notes creates a new truncated mode of limited transposition.

*C E G

Removing two notes for every one kept creates a new truncated mode of limited transposition.

*C F

Keeping two notes for every one removed creates another truncated mode of limited transposition.

*C E F A

Only Messiaen&#x27;s mode 7 and mode 3 are not truncated modes: the other modes may be constructed from them or from one or more of their modes. Mode 7 contains modes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Mode 6 contains modes 1 and 5. Mode 4 contains mode 5. Mode 3 contains mode 1.

==Use and sound==
Messiaen found ways of employing all of the modes of limited transposition harmonically, melodically, and sometimes polyphonically. The whole-tone and octatonic scales have enjoyed quite widespread use since the turn of the 20th century, particularly by Debussy (the whole-tone scale) and Stravinsky (the octatonic scale).

The symmetry inherent in these modes (which means no note can be perceived as the tonic), together with certain rhythmic devices, Messiaen described as containing &quot;the charm of impossibilities&quot;.

The composer Tōru Takemitsu made frequent use of Messiaen&#x27;s modes, particularly the third mode. The composer Alexander Tcherepnin has adopted the third mode as one of his synthetic scales, and it is known as the &quot;Tcherepnin scale&quot;.

==In other temperaments==
There are no modes of limited transposition in any prime equal division of the octave, such as 19 equal temperament or 31 equal temperament.

Composite divisions, such as 15 equal temperament or 22 equal temperament, have them. The 12-note chromatic scale can itself be considered such a mode when viewed as a subset of a larger system that contains it, such as quarter tones or 72 equal temperament.

For example, eight equal temperament, the lowest non-prime equal temperament not completely included in 12-tet (due to a scale step in 24-tet), would have modes of limited transposition. The first would be 0, 2, 4, 6 (steps: 2222), which has only two transpositions and one mode. Another would be 0, 1, 4, 5 (steps: 1313 and 3131), which has 4 transpositions and 2 modes (the other is 0, 3, 4, 7).

<doc id="1261258" wikidata="Q3868609" url="?curid=1261258" title="Hausa music">
<text>The Hausa are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Sudan, Cameroon and in many other West and Central African countries. Their folk music has played an important part in the development of Nigerian music, contributing such elements as the Goje, a one-stringed fiddle. There are two broad categories of traditional Hausa music: rural folk music and urban court music. They introduced the African pop culture genre that is still popular today.

Ceremonial music (&quot;rokon fada&quot;) is performed as a status symbol, and musicians are generally chosen for political reasons as opposed to musical ones. Ceremonial music can be heard at the weekly &quot;sara&quot;, a statement of authority by the emir which takes place every Thursday evening.

Courtly praise-singers like the renowned Ibrahim Narambada, are devoted to singing the virtues of a patron, such as a sultan or emir. Praise songs are accompanied by kettledrums and &quot;kalangu&quot; talking drums, along with the kakaki, a kind of long trumpet derived from that used by the Songhai cavalry.

Rural folk music includes styles that accompany the young girls&#x27; asauwara dance and the bòòríí or Bori religion both well known for their music. It has been brought as far north as Tripoli, Libya by trans-Saharan trade. The bòòríí cult features trance music, played by calabash, lute or fiddle. During ceremonies, women and other marginalized groups fall into trances and perform odd behaviors, such as mimicking a pig or sexual behavior. These persons are said to be possessed by a character, each with its own litany (kírààrì). There are similar trance cults (the so-called &quot;mermaid cults&quot;) found in the Niger Delta region.

Popular Hausa music artists include Muhamman Shata, who sings accompanied by drummers, Dan Maraya, who plays a one-stringed lute called a kuntikii, Audo Yaron Goje, who plays the goje, and Ibrahim Na Habu, who plays a small fiddle called a kukkuma.

<doc id="1261261" wikidata="Q325565" url="?curid=1261261" title="Lionel Martin">
<text>Lionel Walker Birch Martin (15 March 1878 – 21 October 1945) was an English businessman who co-founded the company that became Aston Martin.

==Early life==
He was born at Nansladron at Pentewan near St Austell in Cornwall, and was an only child. His father was Edward Martin (born in 1843), the owner of Martin Brothers China Clay Merchants in St Austell, who lived at Treverbyn, and who also owned the Lee Moor porcelain factory in Plympton. Martin Brothers, founded in 1837, became part of English China Clays.

His mother was Elizabeth Emily Birch (born in 1851 in Salford), she had previously been married to Walter Braithwaite who died; her father was William Singleton Birch, who had founded chalk and lime merchants, Singleton Birch, later run by his uncle Thomas Birch. His parents had married on 26 April 1877 at Lillington, Warwickshire; he was baptised on 20 May 1878 at Lillington church. He grew up in Knightsbridge. 

In 1891 he went to Eton College. In 1897 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was an enthusiast member of the Oxford University Bicycle Club, then joined the Bath Road Club (BRC) In 1900 he went to Marcon&#x27;s Hall, also known as Charsley&#x27;s Hall, run by Charles Abdy Marcon. He graduated with a BA in 1902.

==Cycling==
At university his tandem partner in 1901 was Henry Curtis-Bennett, where they tried to set records in September 1901. He rode with the BRC in 1902. On Wednesday 27 August he left Land&#x27;s End at 7.06am and rode to London, getting to Hyde Park Corner at 5.22am, completing the immense journey in 22 hours and 16 minutes, much faster than the previous record of 25 hours and 25 minutes. The current record for cycling Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats is nine days. He rode the distance on an Imperial Rover.

On Saturday 11 April 1903 at 7am, he rode from Edinburgh post office and arrived at York post office at 7.17pm, in 12 hours 17 minutes, shortening the record by 43 minutes, for a tandem bicycle (a Swift Royal), with Thomas Vade-Walpole (1879-1915), who was part the Walpole family of Norfolk; Thomas&#x27;s brother Horatio would also be killed in 1918; Horatio (1881-1918) was the grandfather of Robert Walpole, 10th Baron Walpole, the father of diplomat Alice Walpole. This record was beaten by 42 minutes on Friday 7 July 1905 by Knipe and Irving.

He gave up cycling in 1904, but returned to the sport in 1910, due to his driving ban. On Monday 27 June 1910, he attempted the Edinburgh to York record again, but faced a strong head wind, so after 149 miles and 11 hours, he finished in Northallerton. He now cycled with Robert Bamford and together formed a sales business in December 1912.

==Motorcycling==
In a motorcycle and side car, Martin and Robert Bamford would take part in the annual competition from London to Gloucester, and back, held by the North West London Motor Cycle Club. The route would start from Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle, Hampstead via Brockley Hill, Aston Hill, Princes Risborough, and Cirencester. It would return via Birdlip Hill, Aston Rowant, and High Wycombe, a distance of 235 miles.

A hill climb was held by the Cyclecar Club at Aston Clinton, on Saturday 4 April 1914; the winning team included H. F. S. Morgan, W. G. McMinnies, George Hands of Calthorpe cars, and John Talfourd Wood (of Walton-on-Thames)
 of GWK. He also competed in a cyclecar around Pebblecombe Hill, near Betchworth for the Westall Cup, with the Cyclecar Club, and with Auto-Cycle Union events around the Peak District, and with the British Motor Cycling Racing Club at Brooklands. With the Motor Cycling Club, he took part in the classic trial to Edinburgh, starting at the Old Gate House Hotel in north London, via Carlisle and Galashiels.

==Career==
Through the Bath Road Club he met Montague Napier, and in 1903 went into partnership with Napier to sell cars. 

In 1909 after not paying a fine, when caught speeding on 15 April 1909 on Kew Road at 26mph, he was banned from driving for two years at Guildford, under the Motor Car Act 1903. Being represented by Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury (Lord Tiverton), he appealed at the High Court on 12 January 1910, but lost the appeal, given by John Alexander Strachey Bucknill and Sir Reginald More Bray at the King&#x27;s Bench Division.

For the next two years he rode bicycles, gaining the fastest record from Edinburgh to York in 1911.

===Aston Martin===
During his driving ban he had become friends with another cyclist in the Bath Road Club, Robert Bamford. In 1912 they began to sell cars together. They co-founded Bamford and Martin Limited, at Henniker Mews in Kensington. Martin participated in competitions of the Motor Cycling Club, including those from London to Edinburgh. Their first advert was in the &quot;Bath Road News&quot;.

Their first prototype was registered in March 1915. To provide an evocative name for the car, the pair remembered their races at Aston Hill, and called the car the &quot;Aston-Martin&quot;; the &quot;AM&quot; radiator badge went onto their cars.

It was through the money from the Singleton Birch family minerals company Martin had the funds to expand his business.

In November 1925, Bamford and Martin Ltd went into receivership, and Martin was no longer a director of the company. At this time, Martin was working for Singleton Birch. After 1925, he never owned an Aston Martin car.

==Personal life==
In 1909, Martin married Christine Murray (born 1888) of Auchendinny in Midlothian; Christine died in April 1913, shortly after the birth of their son (born 19 March 1913). Martin then married Katherine King (born 14 July 1888) on 25 January 1917 in Kensington. Katherine died in 1959.

In 1904 he lived at 7 St Leonard&#x27;s Mansions on St Leonard&#x27;s Terrace in Chelsea. In 1905 he lived at 51 Cheyne Court, Chelsea. In 1909 he lived at 3 Ryder Street in St James&#x27;s In the 1920s he lived at Pembroke Villas in Kensington. In his later years, he was a diabetic.

Due to petrol rationing in the Second World War, he returned to travelling on his bicycle; on 14 October 1945, he was knocked off at a set of traffic lights on Gloucester Road near his home, dying aged 67 in Kingston County Hospital on 21 October 1945. He had lived from 1932 at Palings Cottage on Warboys Road at Kingston Hill, in the Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe. His funeral was at 3 pm on Monday 29 October 1945 at St. John the Baptist in Kingston Vale. He was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery.

<doc id="1261267" wikidata="Q7171967" url="?curid=1261267" title="Pete Franklin">
<text>Pete Franklin (September 22, 1927 – November 23, 2004), nicknamed &quot;The King&quot;, &quot;Sweet Pete&quot; and &quot;Pigskin Pete&quot;, was an American sports talk radio host who worked in Cleveland, New York and San Francisco. He is widely credited with pioneering the more aggressive, acerbic and attention-grabbing form of the genre, which has since been adopted by generations of sports media personalities, and bringing it to a multinational listening audience.

==Early life and career==
Franklin was born September 22, 1927, in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. His first broadcasting job was for Armed Forces Radio, and his first radio station job was in 1952 in Oakdale, Louisiana. &quot;I worked 70 hours a week, and my main job was to get to the station early and kill the snakes with a baseball bat,&quot; he said of his Louisiana assignments. &quot;They came out of the swamp to the heat of the generator. And I read the farm news. The glamour of show business.&quot;

He later worked at radio stations in North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey, California and Texas, often as a disc jockey. He worked as operations director for WOIO in Canton, Ohio, before moving to WERE (1300 AM) in Cleveland in 1967 to host a sports talk show from 7 to 11 PM, after which he hosted a multi-subject talk show from midnight until 5 AM.

==WWWE in Cleveland==
The zenith of Franklin&#x27;s career came when he hosted &quot;Sportsline&quot; on 50,000-watt Cleveland AM station WWWE (&quot;3WE&quot;) 1100-AM (eventually renamed WTAM) from 1972 to 1987. Arguably the most popular host on the station, he was popular for his extensive knowledge, outspoken opinions, gruff demeanor and rude banter with callers. Among his trademarks were playing the sound of a flushing toilet as he cut off callers he considered offensive, playing funeral music when the Indians were hopelessly out of contention for the season in question (thus giving them a &quot;proper burial&quot;, usually in midsummer given their poor play at that time), his winner and the loser of the day preceded by appropriate introductory music for each, and boasting that his station&#x27;s nighttime signal could be heard &quot;over 38 states and half of Canada&quot; (a claim still stated on air by WTAM talk-show hosts to this day).
His caustic personality was a primary reason why &quot;3WE&quot; lost its status as the flagship station of the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers in 1981 when he feuded with team owner Ted Stepien. Franklin and Cavaliers&#x27; radio voice Joe Tait openly questioned Stepien&#x27;s ability to operate the team after multiple poor trades and unwise free agent signings leading to a depletion of talent. He went so far as to refer to Stepien again and again by his initials, &quot;T.S.&quot;, which Franklin said stood for &quot;Too Stupid.&quot; Stepien retaliated by canceling WWWE&#x27;s radio contract and firing Tait.

Franklin popularized several regular callers by giving them nicknames like &quot;The Swami&quot;, &quot;The Prosecutor&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;. The latter, Mike Trivisonno, eventually became a radio host and became Franklin&#x27;s full-time replacement.

==Later career==
In August 1987, Franklin announced he had been hired by upstart all-sports station WFAN in New York City to be its afternoon host starting the following month. His initial contract with the station was for two years and $600,000. But his act wore thin in the Big Apple, where critics and callers alike disliked his condescending style. New York Times columnist George Vecsey wrote that Franklin was a &quot;so-called big name ... whose specialty was hurling insults at fans who knew vastly more than he did.&quot; After much controversy and dismal ratings, he resigned in July 1989 two months before the end of his contract, and was replaced by the &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; program.

He returned to Cleveland and &quot;3WE&quot; immediately afterward. The station even held a press conference to herald his homecoming. However, management dropped him after a year. He moved west, working at KNBR 680 AM in San Francisco from 1991 to 1997 and mostly hosting his show. He revived his &quot;Winners and Losers of the Day&quot; in sports, and his &quot;Pigskin Pete Predicts&quot; during the football season from his Cleveland days. He later joined Bob Fitzgerald as co-hosts of &quot;The King and The Kid&quot;.

Franklin returned for a third time to the WTAM airwaves in 1998, briefly hosting &quot;Sportsline&quot; from a studio in his California home. He joined KNBR&#x27;s sister station KTCT 1050 AM in 1999, and finished his broadcasting career there in 2000.

His book entitled &quot;You Could Argue But You&#x27;d Be Wrong&quot; was published in 1988.

==Death==
Pete Franklin died on November 23, 2004, at age 77 in Nipomo, California, after a long illness.

<text>Adam Michael Melhuse (born March 27, 1972) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics and Texas Rangers. He was the hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers AAA Toledo Mud Hens.

==High school, college years==
Melhuse attended Lincoln High School in Stockton, California and was a student and a letterman in basketball and baseball. He was 1991 West Coast Conference Freshman of the Year in baseball at Santa Clara before transferring to UCLA. In 1991, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1992 to play for the Brewster Whitecaps.

==Major League Baseball career==
Previously, Melhuse played with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, and Texas Rangers. He throws right-handed and is a switch-hitter.

===Colorado Rockies===
Melhuse collected his first career hit on August 22, , in the 12th inning of an unusual game between the Rockies and Atlanta Braves. Out of pitchers, Rockies manager, Buddy Bell, asked injured catcher, Brent Mayne, who was unable to swing a bat due to a sprained left wrist, if he could pitch. Mayne pitched the 12th inning and held the Braves scoreless. The following inning, with two outs and the bases loaded, Melhuse, pinch hitting for Mayne, singled off of Stan Belinda over shortstop Walt Weiss&#x27; head to win the game in walk-off fashion by a score of 8-7. This victory also earned Mayne a pitching win in what would be his only career outing on the mound.

===Oakland Athletics===
On November 6, 2002 Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. He would spend four seasons with the club as a backup to Damian Miller and later Jason Kendall, with his best year coming in 2004 when he hit .257/.309/.463 with 11 home runs and 31 RBI in 69 games.

===Texas Rangers===
On June 10, , Melhuse was traded by the Athletics to the Texas Rangers for cash.
Adam&#x27;s career as a Texas Ranger was short-lived, as the club traded for fellow catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia on July 31, 2007, which lessened Melhuse&#x27;s playing time. Melhuse was designated for assignment on August 24, 2007, and would later be released.

===Oakland Athletics (second stint)===
He re-signed with the Athletics for his second stint in 2007 on September 1 when rosters were expanded. Despite being on the Athletics for a second go-around in September, Melhuse sat on the bench the whole time and did not get into a game. He declared free agency on October 8, 2007, though not before being outrighted to the minors on October 5.

===Texas Rangers (second stint)===
on January 11, Melhuse signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. He made the team out of spring training as a backup to starting catcher Gerald Laird, but injured his hand in a game against the Detroit Tigers on April 24, resulting in his release.

===Colorado Rockies (second stint)===
In late June 2008, Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies and was called up on August 14, 2008. On August 30, 2008, Melhuse was called up to the Rockies from the Triple-A Sky Sox to replace Yorvit Torrealba who was placed on the DL.

===Texas Rangers (third stint)===
Melhuse signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers in January . However, he was released on April 4.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On May 8, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

===Retirement===
On June 17, 2009 Melhuse announced his retirement.

===Post-playing career===
Melhuse spent four seasons as an advance scout for the Chicago Cubs and two seasons in the Los Angeles Angels system as manager of the Burlington Bees. In 2018, he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as hitting coach for the Oklahoma City Dodgers. He was transferred to the Tulsa Drillers for 2019.

<text>Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought is a 2001 book by cognitive anthropologist Pascal Boyer, in which the author discusses the evolutionary psychology of religion and evolutionary origin of religions.

==Summary==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind&#x27;s cognitive inference systems, comparable to pareidolia and perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena resulting from face perception processes within the human brain. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, cognitive science, linguistics, evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and information processing.

&quot;Religion Explained&quot; frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent cognitive neuroscience research in the modularity of mind. This theory involves cognitive &quot;modules&quot; (&quot;devices&quot; or &quot;subroutines&quot;) underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in &quot;supernatural agents&quot; (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from agent detection: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. &quot;When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is.&quot; Boyer cites the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s classic Zande story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.

Within Boyer&#x27;s hypothesis, religion is a &quot;parasite&quot; (or &quot;spandrel&quot;) offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the reading process is parasitic upon language modules.
As I have pointed out repeatedly, the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
is &quot;not&quot; a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of &quot;aggregate relevance&quot; – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.

==Reception==

Critical reception of &quot;Religion Explained&quot; has been mixed.

The psychologist Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi called the book &quot;a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion.&quot; 
He continues: 
The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study &quot;spirituality&quot; or teach &quot;religion and science&quot;. This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn&#x27;t been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.

The journalist David Klinghoffer wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; that &quot;Boyer&#x27;s talk of &#x27;religion is suspiciously generic&quot; and describes his work as &quot;professorial noodlings&quot; that attempt to raise the question whether &quot;all religions are somehow the same&quot;. He further claims that &quot;debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures).&quot;

Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society, described Boyer&#x27;s book as:
a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the University of Bonn, wrote,
Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, &quot;Religion explained&quot; is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer&#x27;s account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.

Garry Runciman, sociologist at Trinity College, Cambridge, asked &quot;Are we hardwired for God?&quot;
The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.

Author and economist Zachary Karabell found stylistic faults. &quot;Boyer&#x27;s use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable.&quot; He concludes, &quot;Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing.&quot;

The comparative religion author Karen Armstrong reviewed Boyer&#x27;s thesis.
Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer&#x27;s description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.

John Habgood, formerly Archbishop of York, wrote.
This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His &quot;explanation&quot; of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.

<doc id="1261294" wikidata="Q928126" url="?curid=1261294" title="Road to Bali">
<text>Road to Bali is a 1952 American comedy film directed by Hal Walker and starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. Released by Paramount Pictures on November 19, 1952, the film is the sixth of the seven &quot;Road to ...&quot; movies. It was the only entry in the series filmed in Technicolor and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day.

==Plot==
George and Harold, American song-and-dance men performing in Melbourne, Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as deep sea divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, Indonesia. They vie for the favors of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala, a cousin of the Prince. A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own.

After escaping from the Prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up on another island. Lala is now in love with both of the boys and can&#x27;t decide which to choose. However, once the natives find them, she learns that in their society, a woman may take multiple husbands, and declares she will marry them both. While the boys are prepared for the ceremony, both thinking the other man lost, plans are changed. She&#x27;s being unwillingly wed to the already much-married King, while the boys end up married to each other.

Displeased with the arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three end up on yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn&#x27;t finish and trying unsuccessfully to keep the words &quot;The End&quot; from appearing on the screen.

===Cameo appearances===
Among the celebrities who made token &quot;gag&quot; appearances in this film are bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing&#x27;s brother), Humphrey Bogart, by way of a clip from &quot;The African Queen&quot;, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Jane Russell, as her character from the film &quot;Son of Paleface&quot; (1952). The cameo by Martin and Lewis was part of a &#x27;comedy trade&#x27; whereby they made an appearance in this movie while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Road to Bali&quot; was the first &quot;Road to...&quot; picture since &quot;Road to Rio&quot; (1947), and was known during production as &quot;The Road to Hollywood&quot;. It was the sixth film in the series, the next to last, as well as the final &quot;Road&quot; film in which Dorothy Lamour&#x27;s role would be the female lead. (Nine years later, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; instead featured Joan Collins, with a cameo by Lamour.) Filming started on April 21, 1952, and continued until July of the same year.

&quot;Road to Bali&quot; was a co-production of Bing Crosby Enterprises, Hope Enterprises and Paramount.

===Filming===
The giant squid that threatens Bob Hope in an underwater scene was previously seen attacking Ray Milland in the Paramount production &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The erupting volcano climax was taken directly from the Paramount production &quot;Aloma of the South Seas&quot; (1941), also starring Lamour.

===Writing===

In keeping with the film&#x27;s initial setting of Melbourne, Australia, many of the jokes contain references to Argyle socks, Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, Tasmanian-born Errol Flynn, and a dance routine featuring Scottish bagpipes.

As with the other Road movies, Bob Hope breaks the &quot;fourth wall&quot; several times to make side comments to the audience. For example, as the music for a song sung by Bing Crosby begins, Hope looks to the camera and says, &quot;He&#x27;s gonna sing, folks. Now&#x27;s the time to go out and get the popcorn.&quot;

Crosby breaks the fourth wall after Hope &quot;notices&quot; the audience is paying attention when he&#x27;s about to tell Crosby how he escaped from the giant squid. Hope and Crosby walk away from the camera and Hope tells his story in exaggerated pantomime (out of earshot). Crosby then walks back toward the audience and shrugs at the camera.

===Sets===
Hope Enterprises owned one-third of the film and Bob Hope wrote about this in his book &quot;This Is on Me&quot;. &quot;There are other pleasant things about owning part of a picture. In the &quot;Road to Bali&quot; there was a beach scene for which tons of beautiful white sand had been trucked in from Pebble Beach. I had just put in a one-hole golf course at my house on Moorpark Street in North Hollywood. I had four sand traps standing empty, with nothing in them in which my friends could leave their hoof prints. When I saw that sand a light switched on in my head.
“We own two-thirds of this sand, don’t we?” I asked.
“Sure,” Bing said. “Why?”
“Well,” I replied, “I’d like some of it for my course at home.”
When he said, “Why not?” I called the prop man and said, “Take ten truck-loads of this sand out to my house when we’re done with it.”
“No dice,” he said. “This is Paramount’s sand.”
Bing and I had another talk with the boys in the front office. As a result, part of the &quot;Road to Bali&quot; is in my back yard.

==Reception==
Paramount hired the Bijou Theatre in New York City on November 14, 1952, to preview the film to exhibitors and critics. Hope was not happy that Paramount only spent $150,000 promoting the film compared to the $300-$400,000 he expected. The film opened in the United States on December 25, 1952, and opened in fourth position at the box-office. The New York premiere of the film took place at the Astor Theatre on January 29, 1953.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was very enthusiastic in his review of January 30, 1953: &quot;it is apparent that this veteran and camera-scarred team is the neatest, smoothest combo of comics now working the fun side of the screen. Apart, they may be very funny or clever or quaint or what you will, according to where you are sitting and what sort of picture they’re in. But together, and in a &#x27;Road&#x27; picture, with the consequent freedom of style and reckless impulse that goes with it, they are pretty nigh nonpareil. At least, that&#x27;s the word of this reviewer who spent a small part of yesterday falling out of a seat at the Astor while desperately clutching his sides. The reason? Quite simply, &quot;Road to Bali&quot; is a whoopingly hilarious film, full of pure crazy situations and deliciously discourteous gags, all played with evident relish and split-second timing by the team.&quot;

William Brogdon of &quot;Variety&quot; was more cautious, having seen a preview, and their comments may have resulted in the removal of a couple of scenes: &quot;Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour are back again in another of Paramount’s highway sagas, this time in Technicolor, with nonsensical amusement its only destination. That end is reached eventually, but the road isn’t a smooth highway and the entertainment occasionally falters. Overall, however, it serves its intended purpose satisfactorily and the grossing prospects are okay...Hal Walker’s direction is geared to the free-wheeling spirit that dominates the script and does well by it, as do the three stars and the featured cast.&quot; An extended choreographed version of &quot;The Road to Bali&quot; song which was cut from the final print has surfaced in recent years, and Paramount chief Adolph Zukor revealed in his autobiography that an expensive water ballet sequence was cut from the film too.

==Soundtrack==
The music for all songs was written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke. Van Heusen&#x27;s birth name was Edward Chester Babcock. For the final &quot;Road&quot; picture, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, Hope&#x27;s character was called Chester Babcock.

When Decca Records was recording the songs from the movie, they did not use Dorothy Lamour. Peggy Lee recorded the Lamour vocals.

&quot;Road to Bali&quot; was parodied in 1953 in the animated short &quot;Alley to Bali&quot;, with Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard in the Hope and Crosby roles. The cartoon was released by Universal Studios, which currently owns the first four &quot;Road to...&quot; films.

===Copyright status===
The film was copyrighted under registration LP2200 1 January 1953. That registration entry also shows &quot;in notice: 1952&quot;, meaning that is the year in the copyright notice on the film. The copyright was renewed under RE105899 dated 1 September 1981. However, according to copyright law, when the &quot;in notice&quot; year is earlier than the calendar year of the official registration, the copyright term begins in the earlier year (1952 in this case). Therefore, for films registered for copyright in 1950 and later, the window for a valid renewal was the 28th calendar year of the original copyright term. For &quot;Road to Bali&quot;, the 28th year was 1980, which means the film had already fallen into the public domain when the copyright was renewed in 1981.

==Home media==
Columbia Pictures Television (in joint venture with LBS Communications through what was then Colex Enterprises) once had the television rights to this film in the 1980s, along with other Bob Hope movies from the 1940s and 1950s. This is evident in a home video release from the mid-1990s, where a CPT logo can be seen at the beginning and end of the film.

Because the film is in the public domain, there have been at least a dozen DVD releases from a variety of companies over the years. However, Fremantle now holds ancillary rights to this film (as the successor in interest to LBS Communications), and official video releases have been issued under license from Fremantle, with DVD and HD-DVD releases coming from BCI Eclipse. A DVD and Blu-Ray were released on July 5, 2017, by Kino International.

<doc id="1261302" wikidata="Q1188443" url="?curid=1261302" title="Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)">
<text>Number Six is a family of fictional characters from the reimagined science fiction television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The character is portrayed by Canadian actress and model Tricia Helfer. Of the twelve known Cylon models, she is the sixth of the &quot;Significant Seven&quot;. Like the others of the &quot;Significant Seven&quot;, there are several versions of her, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey, Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust, Lida, and Sonja. She is the only model that does not use one particular human alias for all copies.

The character was named after Number Six, Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s character from the show &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

==Appearance and personality traits==
Throughout the show, Six is portrayed as a seductive, statuesque Cylon infiltrator. She was the first example shown of a new generation of Cylons capable of adapting to human form and emotions. Little else is known of her earlier years. She can, like other Cylons, retain memories which can be downloaded into another body if the original body is killed. Like her counterparts, her body was designed to mimic the human body at the cellular level, making her almost undetectable to testing procedures, and there are many copies of her in existence. Sixes and Eights are the Humanoid Cylon models shown most frequently. Sixes tend to have individualistic traits and are considerably susceptible to the full array of human emotions. Although extremely effective and adaptive, Sixes always show a certain disdain for their given chores and dislike being treated as expendable. Most versions of Six have platinum-blonde hair, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey and Sonja. Others such as Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust and Lida have honey-blonde hair, and one Six with black hair has been observed.

It was stated by &quot;Caprica&quot; showrunner Kevin Murphy that had the prequel series &quot;Caprica&quot; continued, it would be revealed that the Sixes&#x27; default personality was modeled after that of Zoe Graystone.

==Music==
Since her debut in the mini-series, a leitmotif has been used in scenes featuring Tricia Helfer as Six. This simple 8-note motif was composed by Richard Gibbs. The 18/8 figure, with a 120 BPM tempo, is divided into 2 groups of 4 notes: 1st group played on the downbeats, 2nd group played on the upbeats. Each group is separated by 2 consecutive eight-notes rests on the 8th and 9th ones, resulting in a syncopated line but still keeping a feeling of even 4 notes played at an even interval: the 2nd group of 4 played on the upbeats is also followed by 2 eight-notes rests to end the 18/8 bar. It is almost always performed on a gamelan, and can be compared to an E5 note tuned at A 440 Hz. It also plays over the introduction to each episode of the series. On the published series soundtrack, the melody is listed as &quot;The Sense of Six&quot;. 22/28/akb5.jpg - Visionneuse Zupimages

==Versions==
Copies of Number Six appear regularly, mostly within Cylon society. Several notable versions have had more prominent roles:

===Caprica Six===
At the beginning of the miniseries, a Six copy is involved in an intense affair with Dr. Gaius Baltar. Pretending to be an employee of a computer corporation, Six seduces Baltar while helping him with his work on the Colonial Defense System. After infiltrating the mainframe, Six reveals her true nature to Baltar. Just a few hours before the intended Cylon attack, she informs him that the Cylons will use the computer access code that he has given her to infiltrate the highest levels of Colonial defence systems; thereby disabling the Colonial military, and attacking the Twelve Colonies. That same day, the Cylons launch their multi-targeted attack and destroy most of humanity. Six uses her body to shield Baltar from a nuclear blast during the attack, saving his life and sacrificing hers.

In the episode &quot;Downloaded&quot;, this Six copy is downloaded into a new body. Nicknamed &quot;Caprica Six&quot; by fellow Cylons, she is viewed as a hero within the Cylon civilization for her complete success in her mission to compromise the colonies&#x27; defences. She is surprised to discover she has &#x27;emotions&#x27; and expresses a degree of regret at her actions, as evinced by her constant visions of Baltar. This &quot;Head Baltar&quot; acts as a critical counsellor and manipulator to her in the same way Head Six does for the real Baltar. Caprica Six is enlisted to motivate the resurrected &quot;Galactica&quot; copy of Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii to move out of her apartment and reintegrate into Cylon society. However, in defiance of their superiors, both Caprica Six and Sharon opt instead to aid Sam Anders, to the extent that Caprica Six murders a Three to save him. Allowed by the &quot;Caprica&quot; Cavil, Caprica Six and Sharon then begin preaching peace with the humans as the way of God. This leads them to take over Cylon culture and to resume the hunt for humanity, leading them to the colony of New Caprica, which they take over in a bloodless coup facilitated by Baltar, who surrenders to Caprica Six as soon as the Cylons arrive.

After the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, Caprica Six alienates the other Cylons with her desire for peaceful coexistence with humans. Her reunion with the real Baltar, however, shatters her illusions about her former pawn, as Baltar impotently allows the Cylons to bully him into enacting their oppressive tyranny upon New Caprica. The other Cylons insist Baltar must sign an execution order for 200 insurgents in response to two suicide bombings by the human resistance movement. Baltar initially refuses and Caprica Six alone objects strongly to her fellow Cylons&#x27; desire for mortal retribution. These objections resulted in her being shot in the head by fellow Cylon, Aaron Doral. Her death and an immediate threat to shoot Baltar force him to sign the order. Caprica Six is reborn and helps Baltar escape onto a Cylon Basestar when New Caprica is ultimately abandoned by its population.

Caprica Six becomes involved in a ménage à trois with Baltar and Biers after settling on the Basestar and explicitly states she loves both of them. She was also instrumental in rescuing an inexplicably sick Hera from the Basestar. She assists in Athena&#x27;s download and witnesses the obvious bond between Athena and Hera. Caprica subsequently disables and then kills Boomer who threatens to throttle Hera despite Athena&#x27;s anguished pleas. She leads Athena and her child to a captured Raptor and returns with them to &quot;Galactica&quot;, where she is promptly imprisoned. In this situation, she is frequently used as a source of information about and means of understanding the Cylon&#x27;s motivations.

Colonel Saul Tigh begins to make more frequent stops to her cell, questioning her about what it is like to exist as a Cylon. He confronts her about being responsible for the deaths of billions and whether she feels any remorse or if she can just &#x27;flip a switch&#x27; and shut out the pain. Caprica Six questions Tigh&#x27;s reasons for the line of questioning, unaware Tigh is one of the then-unrevealed &#x27;Final Five&#x27; Cylons. When she goads him about needing to feel pain, he turns to leave but she assaults him and bludgeons him. To her surprise, he cries and begs for more pain, but in response, she abruptly aborts her assault, shakes her head and replies he does not need any more pain. She then kisses him passionately.

Dr. Cottle later reveals Caprica Six is pregnant. It is revealed Tigh is the father of the baby. After it is revealed, Tigh is one of the Final Five, Caprica Six&#x27;s relationship with Tigh changes. The significance of her pregnancy increases as the child will not be a human-Cylon hybrid but will be a pure Cylon offspring. Caprica Six begins to live with Tigh in his quarters on Galactica and the two now share a very intimate and caring relationship. However, when Ellen Tigh returns, she, Tigh, and Caprica Six fight about whom Tigh really loves, and Caprica Six loses the baby.

She joins the rescue mission for Hera and is finally proud of Baltar, something she had always wanted, and feels was the one thing missing between the two of them. They both see Head Six and Head Baltar and are shocked the other sees them. The two defend &quot;Galactica&quot; against Cylon boarders and take Hera when they find her wandering alone. Caprica Six holds a gun on Cavil during the standoff over Hera and hands him the phone when the deal is made. Later, on Earth, she and Baltar are visited one last time by Head Six and Head Baltar, who explain their destiny was to protect Hera and while God&#x27;s plan is never over, their lives will be much less eventful. Caprica Six and Baltar then go off to start new lives as farmers together.

Ronald D. Moore has stated that Baltar never bothered to learn her name. In the season finale, there&#x27;s a flashback scene on Caprica in which Gaius tells her &quot;he has forgotten her name.&quot; The non-canon novelization of the miniseries by Jeffrey A. Carver suggests Caprica Six went by the name Natasi.

===Head/Inner/Messenger Six===
A distinct copy derived from Caprica Six residing in Baltar&#x27;s head since the destruction of the colonies, &quot;Head Six&quot; appears as a figment of his imagination, invisible to everyone else. She suggests this phenomenon might be caused by either a computer chip implant or insanity over his guilt. When Baltar undergoes an MRI-like &quot;brain scan&quot;, it reveals no sign of a computer chip or any other foreign object in his brain. While this briefly leads Baltar to think he has truly gone insane, he concludes this is impossible, given Six&#x27;s knowledge of events unknown to him (for example, the prediction of the birth of the Human/Cylon Hybrid to Sharon Agathon while a prisoner aboard &quot;Galactica&quot;). Confronted with this in Part II of &quot;Home&quot;, Six declares that she is neither a computer chip &quot;nor&quot; a hallucination produced by mental instability. When Baltar then asks just who or what she is, she simply replies she is &quot;an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you and to love you.&quot; She repeats this claim in the episode &quot;Torn&quot;.

This Six often appears suddenly, without warning. She often advises and gives instructions to Baltar. While she usually appears to him as part of the real world, occasionally he interacts with her in an imagined but persistent dream-like setting within his mind.

While Six can physically interact with Baltar in his imagination, it is for most of the series unclear if she is able to physically affect him in the real world — this is finally resolved in the episode &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;, where Head Six is shown lifting Baltar from the floor to a standing position after he endured repeated blows from a &quot;Galactica&quot; marine.

This manifestation of Six in particular is extremely religious. In contrast to the colonists, and like the other Cylons, she believes in a singular god, whom she identifies as Love. She constantly attempts to convince Baltar to believe in the Cylon god, and to accept his part in God&#x27;s plan or will.

Her motivations are unclear. While some of her advice appears to benefit humanity, for example, pointing out a Cylon device to Baltar on &quot;Galactica&quot; and helping him build a Cylon detector, it more often serves only Baltar&#x27;s needs, and she expresses enjoyment over what she considers the inevitable extinction of the human race, constantly saying humanity is naturally violent and would have destroyed itself without the Cylons&#x27; intervention.

Head Six appears to be somehow related to Caprica Six, which is the Six model who seduced Baltar on the planet Caprica and encouraged him to give her access to the Colonial Defense mainframe. This belief is supported by the fact that Caprica Six has her own Head Baltar, implying some sort of transcendental connection between those two specific characters. Nonetheless, once the audience is re-introduced to Caprica Six, it becomes clear that something more unusual is going on since Caprica Six and Baltar bear little resemblance in personality to their internal counterparts.

Head Six is seen less frequently following the departure from New Caprica. In her brief appearances in the first part of season 4, Baltar begins to refer to her as an angel.

In the final episode of the series, it is made clear that, like the Starbuck Avatar, Head Six is indeed an agent of a higher power as she claims, not a chip or a delusion inside Baltar&#x27;s head. She and Head Baltar are the last-seen characters in the final moment of the episode, which takes place 150,000 years after the rest of the series. Their role as angel-like beings was to guide Baltar and Caprica Six in protecting Hera, and once that task is done, they leave them alone. She and Head Baltar speculate on whether the cycle will continue (recalling the theme of &quot;all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again&quot;); Head Six reveals that her excitement over humanity&#x27;s potential extinction was a ruse and states her belief that the cycle has finally been broken.

Although the name is not used by characters in the context of the story, Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore revealed in his official SciFi BSG podcasts &quot;Head Six&quot; is the designation given to the character in scripts and production documents. In discussions of the final episode, Moore also calls this version Inner Six who, along with Inner Baltar, are &quot;... messenger(s) of a higher power&quot;, reinforcing the variations &quot;Head Six&quot;, &quot;Inner Six&quot; and &quot;Messenger Six&quot; (or Head/Inner/Messenger Baltar) used by fans to describe these characters.

During the Season 2 episode &quot;Home&quot;, Gaius Baltar refers to Head Six as &quot;Sara&quot; when in the holding cell designed for Sharon Valerii earlier in the season. Whether this was an unauthorized ad-lib by the actor or perhaps it was what he calls her is unclear as she is never referred to by name again

===Shelly Godfrey===
In the episode &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;, a Number Six in the fleet using the name &quot;Shelly Godfrey&quot; appears. Godfrey attempts to frame Baltar for betraying the human race with supposed photographic evidence. In addition, she attempts to seduce Commander Adama. She disappears abruptly after her &quot;photographic evidence&quot; is proven to be fake. This leads the people of the fleet to conclude she was a Cylon agent trying to discredit Dr Baltar because of his Cylon detector research. Baltar&#x27;s popularity increases as a result. Felix Gaeta notes that once the photo was resolved, identifying it as a fake was almost too easy, &quot;like she wanted to be found out.&quot; As her appearance coincided with the temporary disappearance of Head Six, it is often wondered (and indeed voiced by Baltar himself) whether she was a physical manifestation of Head Six posing in a dual identity.

The episode does cause the audience (and Baltar) to think Shelly Godfrey is related to Head Six, however this is demonstrated to be a deliberate red herring in subsequent episodes of &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot; The telemovie &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Plan&quot; reveals that Godfrey is indeed an actual Six. After the photo was discovered to be fake, the John Cavil (a Number One model) onboard Galactica who was coordinating Cylon efforts made her enter an airlock and be killed so she could download and give Galactica&#x27;s coordinates to the Cylon fleet. Another Six donned a wig and clothing identical to Godfrey&#x27;s in order to confuse the guards and allow Godfrey to get away from them. In the hallway, Cavil intimates that Godfrey has failed to produce convincing fake evidence because she is attracted to Baltar, and her statement that Baltar is &quot;a brilliant man&quot; who helped them so much on Caprica supports this, despite her protestation that Cavil should have seen her with him because &quot;I was brutal with him. I pushed him.&quot; Later, on Cavil&#x27;s bed, the other Six also notes her sister&#x27;s complete destruction of the Sixes&#x27; cover and her utter failure to discredit Baltar and &quot;his dreamy hair&quot;.

===Gina Inviere===

In the episode &quot;Pegasus&quot; and the telemovie &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Razor&quot;, it is revealed a copy of Six had hidden aboard the &quot;Pegasus&quot;, posing as a civilian network administrator and using the name Gina Inviere (supposedly Old Gemenese for &quot;resurrection&quot;; in reality, &quot;înviere&quot; is Romanian for &quot;resurrection&quot;.) This Number Six gains the confidence of Rear Admiral Helena Cain, with whom she has a romantic relationship, and then-Lieutenant Kendra Shaw, who gives Gina the administrator codes for the &quot;Pegasus&quot; mainframe. Gina uses Shaw&#x27;s password in order to disable the &quot;Pegasus&quot; during a Cylon attack, enabling the ship to be boarded by centurions. Shaw sees another Six with the centurions thereby exposing Gina as a Cylon. Gina manages to get her hands on a gun, but hesitates to shoot Cain, indicating that Gina&#x27;s relationship with Cain was not an act. Gina&#x27;s hesitation enables Shaw to knock her unconscious before Gina can make a decision. Cain orders her former lover&#x27;s imprisonment, condemning her as a thing, and allows Gina to be subjected to torture and gang rape by members of the &quot;Pegasus&quot;″ crew. By the time of the events of &quot;Pegasus&quot;, Gina appears to be catatonic from the severe trauma of her abuse.

In &quot;Pegasus&quot;, Baltar treats Gina&#x27;s injuries and transfers his love of Caprica Six to her, causing Gina to finally start responding. In the two-part episode &quot;Resurrection Ship,&quot; Gina comes out of her catatonic state completely and is so traumatized from her ordeal that she wishes to truly die. To this end, Gina supplies Baltar with vital intelligence on the Cylon Resurrection Ship so that the fleet can destroy it. Once the Resurrection Ship has been destroyed, Gina kills her guard and begs Baltar to kill her. Instead, Baltar releases Gina to seek justice for her torment. Gina corners her former lover, Admiral Cain, in her quarters and kills her in revenge before escaping from the &quot;Pegasus&quot;. She then joins a group of Cylon sympathizers, who want humanity to make peace with the Cylons. The extensive sexual abuse she has suffered renders Gina psychologically unable to be intimate with Baltar until shortly before her death.

In the finale of the second season, Gina detonates a nuclear weapon she had received from Dr Baltar, killing herself, signalling the location of the human settlement to the Cylons, and destroying the &quot;Cloud 9&quot; and several other ships in the human fleet. While the destruction of the Resurrection Ship in &quot;Resurrection Ship Part 2&quot; initially indicates Gina&#x27;s death to be final, &quot;The Plan&quot; reveals that there was another Resurrection Ship in range shortly before Gina&#x27;s death as stated by the fleet&#x27;s copy of John Cavil. However, Gina does not appear to have been downloaded with the Cylons only finding New Caprica by way of detecting the signature of her nuclear detonation a year later. Presumably, this second Resurrection Ship was out of range as the Cylons had chosen to stop chasing the fleet at the time due to the efforts of Boomer and Caprica Six.

Gina has honey-blonde hair, actress Tricia Helfer&#x27;s natural hair colour, instead of the platinum-blonde of most Sixes. Like Shelly Godfrey, she sometimes wears glasses.

Series creator Ron Moore says in the DVD commentary for &quot;Pegasus&quot;, the name &quot;Gina&quot; is directly meant as a jab against critics of the reimagined series who use the derogatory term &quot;GINO&quot; (Galactica&quot; In Name O&quot;nly) to describe it.

Gina appears briefly in one of Boomer&#x27;s flashbacks in &quot;The Plan.&quot; Gina helped prep Boomer for her upcoming transition to a sleeper agent and provided IT support for her cover identity.

===Natalie Faust===

An assertive and authoritative version of Number Six named Natalie appears in the episode &quot;Six of One&quot;. Following a vote to lobotomize Cylon raiders in which a single copy of Number Eight (Boomer) gave the swing vote in favour of lobotomy by siding against the rest of her model, Natalie, along with the remaining Number Sixes, Eights and Twos, leads a coup against the other models. They decide to give sentience to the Cylon Centurions, making them self-aware and capable of feeling for the first time. The other models, led by Cavil, are dumbstruck by this decision and attempt to destroy Natalie and her followers permanently in the episode titled &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, luring them into an ambush by pretending to acquiesce to their demands that they stop lobotomizing the Raiders, unbox the entire Number Three model, and use the knowledge gained by the Three known as D&#x27;Anna at the Temple of Five to identify and join with the lost &quot;Final Five&quot; humanoid Cylon models. The Resurrection Ship is jumped out of range during this ambush so that the deaths suffered by the rebels are permanent.

A Number Two from their damaged Baseship, Leoben Conoy, takes a Heavy Raider and manages to make contact with Lieutenant Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace and her crew on the &quot;Demetrius,&quot; a sewage processing vessel repurposed for long-range exploration in the episode &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;. Conoy offers an alliance between the rebel Cylons and the Colonials. In the episode &quot;Faith&quot;, Conoy, Thrace and some of the &quot;Demetrius&quot; crew take a Colonial Raptor to the rebel Basestar and make repairs, allowing the Baseship – the &quot;Demetrius&quot; following behind – to jump to the Colonial fleet in the episode &quot;Guess What&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, in which Natalie makes a deal with Rear Admiral Adama on the &quot;Galactica&quot; to reveal the location of the main Cylon Resurrection Hub and help the Colonials destroy it, ending resurrection for the enemy Cylons, as long as she can bring the &quot;Final Five&quot; with her off the &quot;Galactica&quot; after Earth is located. And so, a tenuous alliance is formed. Natalie is on her way to speak to Adama again when she encounters the human-Cylon hybrid infant Hera Agathon in the corridor and bends down to talk to her. Natalie is then confronted and shot by Hera&#x27;s mother Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon, the Number Eight who left the Cylons, married Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon and joined &quot;Galactica&quot;&#x27;s crew, because of a dream Athena had in which a Number Six took her daughter. Somehow the rebel Basestar&#x27;s hybrid detects her shooting and panics, causing the ship to jump away. Near the beginning of the episode &quot;Sine Qua Non&quot;, Natalie is taken to the &quot;Galactica&quot; infirmary for treatment where she dies of her injuries. As Natalie dies, she projects a forest scene, a favourite projection of Number Six model. Doctor Cottle also holds Natalie&#x27;s hand as she dies in an act of kindness for the mortally wounded woman. With no Resurrection Ship in range, her death is permanent.

Her surname is not used onscreen, and her first name is only used once, by a Number Eight in the episode &quot;The Hub&quot;, who notes that the Hybrid of their Baseship has reacted to Natalie being killed or injured on &quot;Galactica.&quot; Nor is her backstory elaborated on. Michael Angeli&#x27;s original version of the script for the episode &quot;Six of One&quot; has John Cavil refer to Natalie Faust by her full name and mention that she infiltrated Gemenon posing as a political reform advocate. During the Cylon attack, she was responsible for relaying the coordinates of all the Gemenese leaders.

===Sonja===

A copy named Sonja who has been elected to represent the Cylons in the Quorum. Sonja has taken over Natalie&#x27;s place as the leader of the rebel faction of Cylons. Sonja&#x27;s appearance is that of a typical Six. In her first act as the cyclon leader, she requests that Roslin and Adama hand over Boomer in order to try her for treason against the Cylons. She is later seen at a meeting of the new Quorum of Ships&#x27; Captains, representing the rebel Basestar, as they discuss the impending transfer of Admiral William Adama&#x27;s command from the ageing Galactica to the Basestar. Before the operation to rescue Hera, Sonja and Ellen Tigh are seen discussing the whereabouts of The Colony the place they knew Boomer was going to take Hera to. Sonja revealed that Number One, John Cavil had moved The Colony from its original location 5 months prior shortly before the Cylon civil war took place. And in the series finale, she is seen along with a two and an eight discussing their plan with Adama on how to populate the new Earth saying that they&#x27;ll stay alongside the humans in their new home until their own deaths come.

===&quot;Tough Six&quot;===
A brunette Six with blonde streaks appears in &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Plan&quot;. She had been a prostitute on the Colonies, and eventually drunkenly mocks John Cavil&#x27;s schemes while sharing a bed with him, following the not-quite-fatal shooting of Commander Adama by Cylon sleeper agent Boomer and the suicide of their fellow infiltrator Simon O&#x27;Neill, a Number Four. She points out that most of the Cylons&#x27; failings, including those mentioned above, along with Number Two Leoben Conoy&#x27;s interaction with Lieutenant Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace and Shelly Godfrey&#x27;s failure to ruin Gaius Baltar, have been due to love, and leaves the room telling Cavil that &quot;you can&#x27;t declare war on love&quot;. She typically wears chains-and-leather clothing and has been seen to chew bubblegum during a Cylon meeting in Cavil&#x27;s chapel, sitting next to Godfrey, who has platinum hair and wears glasses and a sensible blouse and skirt. Cavil notes that the Sixes have done a good job of distinguishing themselves and praises Godfrey for it, in contrast to the Number Five/Aaron Doral copy who has individuated himself from the copy abandoned on Ragnar only by wearing a teal suit instead of a burgundy one, in the same cut.

This Six, not given a name onscreen but referred to as &quot;Tough Six&quot; in the shooting script, was instrumental in the mysterious disappearance of Ms Shelly Godfrey from &quot;Galactica&quot;, using a wig and a change of clothes to imitate Godfrey&#x27;s appearance and confuse the marines who were tailing her, making them think that Godfrey had gotten further ahead of them when the real Godfrey was pulled into another corridor by John Cavil. Godfrey and Cavil then slipped away and Cavil airlocked Godfrey, while the marines were chasing Tough Six, who evaded them. The ultimate fate of Tough Six is unknown, whether she was captured and executed or remained in the fleet until New Caprica, as she is not seen in &quot;The Plan&quot; following her exit from Cavil&#x27;s bedroom and did not appear in regular episodes.

===Other versions===
Number Sixes have been shown in a variety of roles, including repairing the Galactica (&quot;Deadlock&quot; and &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;), hospital administration (&quot;The Farm&quot;), serving as Heavy Raider pilots, and as rebel Cylon leaders (Natalie and Sonja). Other versions include:

*A copy in a red tunic, who arrives aboard the Armistice Station and seduces the Colonial representative (otherwise known as Boxey&#x27;s father) shortly before the station is destroyed. Similar copies are part of the group that board Ragnar Anchorage to rescue and debrief Aaron Doral.
*A copy, wearing a white overcoat, who captures and kisses Helo before being shot by Sharon Agathon. Another white coat-wearing Six observes their escape, and another (possibly one of these two) later leads Centurion troops in pursuit of them. In &quot;Razor&quot;, a copy in a white coat is the one seen and shot by Kendra Shaw during a Cylon boarding raid on the &quot;Pegasus.&quot; In &quot;The Plan&quot;, another white coat wearing copy appears to be overseeing the Centurions pinning down the Colonial forces during the events of &quot;Lay Down Your Burdens.&quot; This copy communicates the Cylon-Colonial truce to the Caprica copy of John Cavil who agrees to let the human fleet know despite his model voting against it.
*A copy of Six in a black suit, who acts as &quot;overseer&quot; to the breeding experiment concerning Helo and Sharon Agathon. This copy or a similar one is killed by Starbuck in the Delphi Museum while retrieving the Arrow of Apollo. The copy of number Eight that would eventually become known as Sharon Agathon warned that she would soon download into a new body and lead the Cylons to their position. A copy of this type is also killed by Starbuck while escaping the Cylon farm
*Copies, clad in gold tunics, who act as &quot;nurses&quot; or &quot;midwives&quot;, helping Caprica Six and Boomer through their respective resurrections.
*Two copies that take part in a meeting aboard &quot;Colonial One&quot; on New Caprica, and agree with the proposal to execute over 200 human detainees. They vote on behalf of the majority of the Number Six model (Caprica Six dissents).
*A raven-haired copy, dying from a disease aboard a basestar, whom Baltar strangles after she hysterically accuses him of deliberately leading them to the disease-carrying beacon (perhaps in an effort to get him to kill her).
*Copies from the infected basestar that are brought aboard &quot;Galactica&quot;. Along with the other captured infected Cylons, they are suffocated by Helo before the &quot;Galactica&quot; enters Cylon resurrection range to prevent the Colonials from committing genocide.
*A copy from &quot;Faith&quot; aboard the damaged Basestar. She recognizes crew-member Jean Barolay as a resistance fighter from New Caprica who gagged her, threw her into a septic tank and watched her drown, an event that has left her emotionally traumatized. After Barolay tells her she&#x27;d be happy to do it again, the copy attacks and kills her. Shortly afterwards she is shot and killed by another Six copy, Natalie who does it to give the Colonials &quot;justice&quot; since there is no Resurrection Ship in range.
*A copy named Lida, with long brown hair, who comforts Gaius Baltar in Blood on the Scales.
*Multiple Sixes are seen as pilots of Cylon Heavy Raiders working alongside Galactica pilots in Faith and Someone to Watch Over Me. They use &quot;Six&quot; as their &quot;de facto&quot; surname.
*The &quot;Cylon Prototype&quot; voiced by Helfer in the last episode of &quot;Blood and Chrome&quot;.

==Casting==
Tricia Helfer was cast after a strong audition, despite some initial concerns over her lack of acting experience. Director Michael Rymer explains:

&quot;It wasn&#x27;t just the way she looked; she just has this vibe about her. Nobody gets how hard that role is, to bring the depth, the vulnerability and the mystery to essentially a robot chick.&quot;
Among the other actresses who auditioned for the role were Melinda Clarke and Leah Cairns, who went on to play Racetrack.

==Reception==
James Maddox of &quot;Game Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;Tricia Helfer&#x27;s seductive Number Six came to define the humanoid Cylon in pop culture and is in many ways the most iconic element of the franchise as a whole.&quot;

In 2006, Tricia Helfer was awarded the Leo Award for &quot;Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series&quot; for her role as Number Six in the episode &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

<text>An act is a major division of a theatre work, including a play, film, opera, ballet, or musical theatre, consisting of one or more scenes. The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes) or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. The word &quot;act&quot; can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as variety shows, television programs, music hall performances, cabaret, and literature.

== Acts and scenes ==
An act is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax, and . A scene normally represents actions happening in one place at one time and is marked off from the next scene by a curtain, a blackout, or a brief emptying of the stage.

The elements that create the plot of a play and divide it into acts include the exposition, which sets up the rest of the story by giving basic information. Another element is the inciting incident, which starts all the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed, which holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications, which change the action. These complications lead to the crisis, which is the final plot point. At this point, the major dramatic question is usually answered. Finally, the play culminates with a resolution, or the dénouement, where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved. These elements of the plot are the main things used to divide a play into acts and sometimes scenes. In some scenarios, the play may not end with a resolved situation; it may leave the audience on a peak and have a sequel to it, otherwise known as a cliffhanger.

Though there is no limit to the number of acts in a dramatic work, some may have been derived from different interpretations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and &quot;an orderly arrangement of parts&quot;, and others may have been derived from Freytag&#x27;s Pyramid.

== History ==
Roman theatre divided plays into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into scenes. In classical theater, each regrouping between the entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting.

Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer, and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely. Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place, but the division between acts has more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision or having an important decision to make, a decision that has a profound impact on the story being told.

Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a three-act structure. Many operettas and most musicals are divided into just two acts, so, in practice, the intermission is seen as dividing them, and the word &quot;act&quot; comes to be used for the two-halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.

== Varieties ==
=== One-act plays ===
A one-act play is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections.

=== Three-act plays ===

In a three-act play, each act usually has a different mood. In the most commonly used structure, the first act has many introductory elements (that is, who, what, when, where, why, and how); the second act is usually the darkest, with the antagonists having a greater compass; and the third act has a resolution (dénouement), often with the protagonists prevailing.
* Act one: The conflict of the story is discovered. The exposition, the introduction of the protagonist and other characters that the protagonist meets, take place, as well as the dramatic premise and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act.
* Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point, seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective, and seems to have no way to succeed.
* Act three: The climax occurs as well as the resolution (dénouement), a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns.

=== Five-act plays ===

Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of William Shakespeare, for example, generally adheres to a five-act structure. This format is known as the five-act play, and was famously analyzed by Gustav Freytag in &quot;Die Technik des Dramas&quot; (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play similar to that of Freytag&#x27;s pyramid.

* Act One: Exposition and inciting incident
* Act Two: First major turning point and progressive complications
* Act Three: Rising action and climax
* Act Four: Falling action
* Act Five: Resolution (For tragedies, a catastrophe is added before it.)

A similar five-part structure is also used in traditional Japanese Noh drama, particularly by Zeami Motokiyo. Zeami, in his work &quot;Sandō&quot; (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five &quot;dan&quot;) Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (&quot;jo&quot;), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (&quot;ha&quot;), with the greatest climax in the third &quot;dan&quot;, and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth &quot;dan&quot; (&quot;kyū&quot;).

== Other media ==
As part of a television program, each individual act can be separated by commercials.

In film, a number of scenes grouped together create a story. The three-act structure is commonly referred to in film adaptations of theatrical plays.

<doc id="1261311" wikidata="Q7644225" url="?curid=1261311" title="Superstation">
<text>Superstation (alternatively rendered as &quot;super station&quot; or informally as &quot;SuperStation&quot;) is a term in North American broadcasting that has several meanings. Commonly, a &quot;superstation&quot; is a form of distant signal, a broadcast television signal—usually a commercially licensed station—that is retransmitted via communications satellite or microwave relay to multichannel television providers (including cable, direct broadcast satellite and IPTV services) over a broad area beyond its primary terrestrial signal range.

Outside of their originating media market, superstations are often treated akin to a conventional basic cable channel. Although six American television stations—none of which has widespread national distribution beyond home satellite or regional cable coverage—still are designated under this classification, these stations were primarily popularized between the late 1970s and the 1990s, in large part because of their carriage of sporting events from local professional sports franchises and theatrical feature films, offerings that were common of the time among independent stations that composed the superstation concept. These signals were also popular among C-band satellite subscribers in rural areas where broadcast signals could not be picked up off-air.

Individual radio stations have also been redistributed via satellite as superstations through cable radio services offered by television providers and standalone satellite radio services. In other parts of North America, the definition of what may constitute even a de facto superstation varies depending on the country and the overall availability of the distributed stations.

==Definition==
In its most precise meaning, per an amended definition under the Copyright Act of 1947, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States defines a &quot;superstation&quot; as a &quot;television broadcast station, other than a network station, licensed by the [FCC], that is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier.&quot; Superstations may fall into one of two classifications, based on the factoring of their extended reach for advertising and program acquisition purposes:
* Active superstations – Television stations that intentionally seek retransmission of their signal outside of their home market through an arrangement with a common satellite carrier firm (which uses an FCC-licensed satellite or satellite service facility to establish &quot;point-to-multipoint&quot; broadcast signal distribution, and which owns or leases a capacity or service on a satellite to provide such distribution), and markets the added distribution to program suppliers and advertisers; these stations target their programming and purchase advertising aimed at a national or regional audience, in addition to selling localized advertising viewable only on the originating broadcast feed;
* Passive superstations – Television stations that make little or no acknowledgement of their superstation status in on-air and other marketing avenues; the station&#x27;s signal is involuntarily redistributed without prior formal consent by a satellite carrier, which handles national advertising, marketing and some programming services for the cable-originated feed in lieu of the station&#x27;s licensee, which itself maintains a neutral or obstinate stance toward the expanded distribution. Locally, the &quot;passive superstation&quot; prioritizes programming and advertising for their originating market, charging rates for such acquisitions and sales accordingly. The station may receive supplementary revenue from federal royalty payments for licensee-copyrighted programs, but subscriber fees paid by cable systems for the use of their signals are distributed to the common carrier.

Through an amendment to the compulsory license statute of the 1947 copyright law, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA) created a sub-definition for &quot;nationally distributed superstations,&quot; which the FCC constitutes as FCC-licensed television stations permitted by Congress for retransmission by satellite carriers regardless of whether they reach &quot;served&quot; or &quot;unserved&quot; subscribers pursuant to the Copyright Act (effectively preventing them from subjection to geographic retransmission restrictions and absolving them from copyright liability if received by subscribers not residing in &quot;unserved households&quot; that have limited to no access to television stations offering similar programming). These stations must also fit the following tight date-specific criteria:
* &quot;(A) [the applicable station] is not owned or operated by or affiliated with a television network that, as of January 1, 1995, offered interconnected program service on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 affiliated television licensees in ten or more states;&quot;
* &quot;(B) [the applicable station] on May 1, 1991, was retransmitted by a satellite carrier and was not a network station at that time; and
* &quot;(C) [the applicable station] was, as of July 1, 1998, retransmitted by a satellite carrier under the statutory license of Section 119 of Title 17, United States Code.&quot;
Beyond the six stations that fit that criteria (including WPIX, KTLA and KWGN-TV, which, at present, uniquely constitute as both &quot;network stations&quot; as well as &quot;nationally distributed superstations&quot; under the FCC and the SHVIA&#x27;s overlapping definitions for both), the definitions under SHVIA and Congressional retransmission consent rules (per Section 325 of U.S. Code Title 47, as amended through the enactment of SHVIA) are restrictive, leaving little possibility that any television stations would in the future be able to befit such criteria and legally be considered a national superstation.

While the FCC defines &quot;superstation&quot; as a term, it does not prohibit its use by others outside of that scope; for example, primary ABC/subchannel-only CW affiliate KYUR (channel 13) in Anchorage, Alaska had collectively branded itself and its network of repeater stations (including full-power satellites in Fairbanks and Juneau) as &quot;Alaska&#x27;s SuperStation&quot; from 1996 to 2011. Some Spanish language networks like Telemundo and Univision may only have one station within an entire state that serves the largest city in their market and is distributed statewide via cable; one such case is Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD (channel 63) in Milwaukee, which maintains cable distribution throughout Wisconsin via Charter Spectrum, along with extended coverage on low-power stations in Rockford, Illinois, and South Bend, Indiana, providing it broad coverage resembling a regional superstation though not marketing itself as such. The term has been (and, in a few cases, currently is) used by many other television and radio stations, but none of these operations is a superstation as defined by the FCC and solely use the term for marketing purposes. Similarly, the &quot;superstation&quot; term has also been occasionally stretched within the broadcasting industry to encompass major network affiliates imported by satellite common carriers to C-band and direct broadcast satellite providers—through packages such as Primetime 24 and its associated &quot;Denver 5&quot; tier, and the Netlink-distributed A3 package—that could not receive locally based network stations prior the implementation of the Satellite Television Extension and Localization Act in 1999.

===Early television superstations===
In the early days of television broadcasting, most large media markets – primarily those ranked among the top 20 in Arbitron and Nielsen estimates – had, by standards of the period, a sizeable number of television stations (sometimes as many as eight or nine in operation). Generally, these markets had three VHF stations that operated as affiliates of the then dominant television networks – NBC, ABC, and CBS; one or more public television stations – which usually were member stations of National Educational Television (NET) and its later successor, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS); one or more UHF stations; and in the largest markets (such as New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago), at least one VHF station without a network affiliation. These independent stations generally relied on syndicated reruns of current or defunct network shows, classic theatrical feature films and some variety of local programming – such as news programs (ranging from as limited as hourly news updates to long-form newscasts, usually airing in prime time and, in some cases, at midday), children&#x27;s programming or sporting events – to fill their broadcast schedules. Because of the available population reach of the region, most mid-sized and smaller media markets often had only the basic three network-affiliated stations (either in the form of three standalone affiliates or a primary-secondary structure in which one or two stations carried programs selected among the schedules of two or all three major networks), with imported network affiliates often serving as default outlets where one or more networks were not available locally.

Early community antenna television (CATV) systems were restricted from retransmitting distant signals to communities no more than approximately from the closest signal, which was a detriment to many small communities, especially sparsely populated areas of the Western United States, that were too distant from any receivable signal. As CATV system capacity increased from three channels to five during the early 1950s, several communities in the Western U.S. began incorporating CATV systems using microwave relay systems that made it possible to retransmit broadcast signals over great distances. In September 1956, Columbia Television Co. in Pendleton, Oregon began using a microwave relay unit operated by Inland Microwave Co. to import three Spokane, Washington television stations, ABC affiliate KREM-TV (channel 2, now a CBS affiliate), CBS affiliate KXLY-TV (channel 4, now an ABC affiliate) and NBC affiliate KHQ-TV (channel 6), to its subscribers. Building on this, other cable and CATV systems in smaller municipalities and rural areas sought a foothold by &quot;importing&quot; broadcast television signals from larger nearby or distant cities for their customers, extending their reach beyond their normal coverage area (in the case of network-affiliated stations, this was to improve reception into areas that could not adequately receive the station&#x27;s signal, whether within or at the edge of the contour, even with an outdoor antenna). Anxious for more viewers, the stations assisted by relaying their signals by wire or microwave transmission.

Within a few years, many other microwave-capable CATV system operators began to import out-of-market television signals based on program offerings they thought would appeal to their subscribers. Except for areas that were far enough out of a signal&#x27;s reach to make this an unviable option, these systems selected major-market independent stations (often located anywhere between away from the relay towers) that aired popular feature films and local sports events. In 1962, Oneonta, New York-based Eastern Microwave Inc. (EMI) – a company that was developed after a technician employed with the parent CATV system observed the operations of Montana-based microwave-to-CATV firm Western Microwave – was founded to relay the signals of WPIX, WNEW-TV and WOR-TV (channel 9, now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV and licensed to Secaucus, New Jersey) to Oneonta Video and other CATV systems in surrounding areas. Eastern Microwave began distributing WOR-TV and either WPIX or WNEW (depending on the system) in March 1965 to three Upstate New York cable systems (Valley Cable Vision in Canajoharie, Carthage Video Division in Carthage and Cortland Video in Carthage). Other microwave firms were also developed to relay independent television stations to cable systems, including H&amp;B Microwave (a subsidiary of H&amp;B Communications Corp., a major provider of CATV service and microwave relays throughout the U.S.), which began retransmitting the signal of WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago to subscribers of the Dubuque TV-FM Cable Company in Dubuque, Iowa; WGN&#x27;s signal soon began to be imported via microwave to other CATV systems throughout the Midwest.

Because of changes to cable television regulations in the 1960s and 1970s, carriage of out-of-market independent stations increased significantly, allowing for the development of the first true &quot;regional superstations.&quot; By way of the microwave connections, Ted Turner began allowing the signal of Atlanta, Georgia independent station WTCG (channel 17, later renamed WTBS and now WPCH-TV) – which he purchased from station founder and fellow Atlanta-based entrepreneur Jack Rice Jr. in December 1969 in a $3-million all-stock transaction – to be distributed into other parts of the Southeastern United States (including Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina). Two major independent station operators began extending coverage of their stations throughout their respective home states and even surrounding states. Gaylord Broadcasting began allowing its independents—WUAB (channel 43, now a CW affiliate) in Lorain–Cleveland, WVTV (channel 18, now a CW affiliate) in Milwaukee, KSTW (channel 11, now an independent station) in Tacoma–Seattle, KTVT (channel 11, now a CBS owned-and-operated station) in Fort Worth–Dallas and KHTV (channel 39, now CW owned-and-operated station KIAH) in Houston—to be distributed to cable systems in their respective regions, as did the Christian Broadcasting Network&#x27;s Continental Broadcasting Network unit for two of its religious-secular hybrid independents, WYAH-TV (channel 27, now independent station WGNT) in Virginia Beach and KXTX-TV (channel 39, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station) in Dallas–Fort Worth.

===WTCG: The first national superstation===
In December 1975, Ted Turner announced plans to redistribute Atlanta&#x27;s WTCG via satellite to cable and C-band satellite services throughout the United States, beyond the 460,000 households in middle and southern Georgia and surrounding Deep South states that had been receiving its signal via microwave since the early 1970s. (Jack Matranga, then the president of KTXL [channel 40, now a Fox affiliate] also unveiled similar plans for his Sacramento, California independent, which were never formulated to fruition.) Turner conceptualized the idea upon hearing of premium cable service Home Box Office (HBO)&#x27;s groundbreaking innovation to retransmit its programming nationwide using communications satellites beginning with its September 30, 1975, telecast of the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; boxing match. With a more cost-effective and expeditious distribution method in place than would be capable through setting up microwave and coaxial telephone relay systems across the entire country, Turner got his idea off the ground by founding Southern Satellite Systems (SSS) – a common carrier uplink provider based in Tulsa, Oklahoma – to serve as the station&#x27;s satellite redistributor, and subsequently purchased an earth-to-satellite transmitting station to be set up outside of WTCG&#x27;s Peachtree Street studios in Atlanta. To get around FCC rules in effect at the time that prohibited a common carrier from having involvement in program origination, Turner decided to sell SSS to former Western Union vice president of marketing Edward L. Taylor for $1 and sold the transmitting station to RCA American Communications. Upon the sale&#x27;s consummation in March 1976, Turner reached an agreement with Taylor to have the firm uplink the WTCG signal to the Satcom 1 satellite.

WTCG became America&#x27;s first nationally distributed superstation on December 17, 1976, when its signal began to be relayed to four cable systems in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. At 1:00 pm. ET (12:00 pm. CT) that day, subscribers of Multi-Vue TV in Grand Island, Nebraska, Hampton Roads Cablevision in Newport News, Virginia, Troy Cablevision in Troy, Alabama and Newton Cable TV in Newton, Kansas began receiving WTCG&#x27;s presentation of the 1948 Dana Andrews-Cesar Romero film &quot;Deep Waters&quot; (which had started on the Atlanta broadcast signal 30 minutes prior). Southern Satellite Systems initially charged prospective cable systems 10¢ per subscriber to transmit WTCG full-time and 2¢ per subscriber to carry it as an intermediary, post-sign-off timeshare service (from as early as midnight to as late as 6:00 a.m. local time). One key legal point in Turner&#x27;s contracts with programming distributors and advertisers was that they continued to charge him for programming content and commercial time as if his station were reaching only a local market. No one had thought of adding contract language to deal with satellite-delivered broadcasts of a television station to a much larger region. Turner Communications Group also chose to revise its advertising rates to better reflect WTCG&#x27;s national cable audience in October 1978.

Also setting WTCG apart from other superstations that would soon follow in its footsteps was that it directly promoted its programming to its national audience, made investments in programming production as well as acquisitions, and charged separate advertising rates at the national and local levels. Given Turner&#x27;s deep pockets, the station paid for syndicated programming at (albeit reasonably cheaper) rates comparable to other national networks, rather than merely receiving royalty payments from cable systems for programs to which it held the copyright. Cable systems found WTCG—one of the few American television stations offering a 24-hour-a-day programming schedule at the time—an attractive offering as it had an extensive film library heavily reliant on classic feature films (amounting to 30 movies per week out of the 2,700 titles that Turner had accrued since taking over the station), high-profile syndicated programs and games from various Atlanta-area sports teams (including the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club, the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA - both of which were owned by Turner - and the Atlanta Flames of the NHL). Soon after it was uplinked, an increasing number of cable television systems throughout the United States sought to carry WTCG as part of their channel lineups, ultimately making it the most widely distributed superstation for the rest of its existence under the format. By May 1978, WTCG was being received by 1.5 million households in 45 states, with figures suggesting that its reach had been increasing at the rate of 100,000 cable households per month; by the end of that year, the station was available through cable systems in all 50 states. By July 1979, the station (by then, known as WTBS) was available to 4.8 million cable subscribers plus an additional 556,000 households that received the station through other distribution methods (including microwave and MMDS services). 

As WTBS, the station also served to help promote Turner&#x27;s subsequent cable efforts, providing simulcasts of Cable News Network (CNN) and CNN2 (later Headline News and now HLN) upon their launches in June 1980 and January 1982, respectively, as well as offering weekend-long marathons promoting the 1992 launch of Cartoon Network. (CNN also produced the station&#x27;s only conventional, long-form news effort as a superstation, the &quot;TBS Evening News&quot;, a prime time newscast that ran from July 1980 to July 1984.) Aside from Turner&#x27;s use of WTBS to help launch his other cable ventures, Southern Satellite Systems also distributed the United Press International (UPI) teletext news service (from 1978 to 1981) and the Electra teletext service (from 1981 to 1993) to the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of the WTBS feed. WTBS remained the most widely distributed superstation for the rest of its existence under the format; by 1987, WTBS was available to 41.6 million cable and satellite subscriber households nationwide. A separate feed of WTBS intended for distribution to cable providers outside the Atlanta market, incorporating national advertising substituting commercials intended for its Atlanta viewing audience, was launched in 1981. (Since the original incarnation of the syndication exclusivity rules had been repealed by that time, program substitutions on the national feed were very limited.)

===WGN-TV, WOR-TV and other emerging superstations===
Turner&#x27;s innovation signaled the development of basic cable programming in the United States and, within three years of WTCG achieving national status, was soon copied by other common carrier firms who decided to apply for satellite uplinks to distribute other independent stations as national superstations; however, while Turner had aggressively pursued national availability for WTCG, the other superstations that would soon emerge did not purposely seek such widespread reach and were either recalcitrant about having their signals imported without consent or ignored the issue directly and allowed their newfound expanded distribution to continue unfettered.

On November 9, 1978, Chicago independent WGN-TV became America&#x27;s second national superstation, when Tulsa, Oklahoma-based common carrier firm United Video Satellite Group, Inc. – one of four applicants, along with Southern Satellite Systems, Lansing, Michigan-based American Microwave &amp; Communications and Milwaukee-based Midwestern Relay Company, that the FCC granted approval to operate satellite transponders to relay the signal following the institution of the FCC&#x27;s distant signal &quot;open entry&quot; policy for carrier firms – uplinked its signal onto a Satcom-3 transponder for redistribution to cable and satellite subscribers. United Video stepped in to assert uplink responsibilities as SSS had become embroiled in a transponder lease dispute with RCA American Communications in pertinence to a lawsuit involving RCA American and SSS&#x27;s Satellite Communication Systems joint venture over the use of Satcom Transponder 18. While TBS partnered with a satellite carrier to relay the WTBS Atlanta signal to a national audience, United Video used the legally structured loophole in the Copyright Act&#x27;s compulsory license statute to uplink the signal of WGN without the prior consent of owner WGN Continental Broadcasting Company (later known as Tribune Broadcasting), a model that would be used for other superstations that emerged in the coming years. United Video did not compensate WGN directly for the retransmission of its signal, though the station and its parent company received royalty payments from cable systems that received the United Video-fed signal for any copyrighted programming (local newscasts, public affairs shows, locally originated children&#x27;s programs and sports) that WGN owned and/or produced.

The station quickly turned into a major commodity among cable systems because of WGN&#x27;s telecasts of Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox baseball, DePaul Blue Demons college basketball, and Chicago Bulls basketball games and its locally popular in-house children&#x27;s programs like &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; (the Chicago iteration of the Bozo the Clown television franchise). As the first superstation that offered long-form newscasts (compared to the newsbriefs offered by WTCG/WTBS for most of the time until 1996 as well as an abbreviated daily satirical newscast, &quot;17 Update Early in the Morning&quot;, which aired from 1976 to 1979 and mixed improvisational and scripted comedy with actual news content), upon moving its late evening newscast to 9:00 p.m. Central Time in March 1980, it also provided a prime time news alternative for viewers wanting to find out national and international headlines without having to wait for post-prime-time newscasts on local network stations, something of particular benefit to snowbirds and other Chicago residents who temporarily or permanently relocated elsewhere in the United States. Immediately after achieving superstation status, WGN-TV became available to an estimated approximately 200 cable systems and 1.5 million subscribers throughout the country; its distribution was heavily concentrated in the Central U.S. until the early 1980s and, by the end of the decade, had gradually expanded to encompass most of the nation with some gaps in the Northeastern U.S. that remained into the early 2010s. In 1985, Tribune—which would assume satellite distribution rights for the WGN national feed through its April 2001 purchase of the portion of United&#x27;s UVTV unit that handled the feed&#x27;s uplink and marketing responsibilities—began providing a direct microwave link of the WGN Chicago signal to United Video, providing it a second signal source in the event technical problems arose with the intercepted satellite signal and vice versa. WGN would become the only superstation to come close to reaching parity with WTBS, although it would continue to lag somewhat in coverage partly due to the two-year headstart of WTBS into the cable market.

KTVU (channel 2) in Oakland–San Francisco followed behind on December 16, 1978, when Satellite Communications Systems uplinked the station onto a Satcom-1 transponder. (Holiday Inns Inc. would withdraw from the Southern Satellite Systems partnership by April 1979, leaving the latter to handle uplink and promotional responsibilities for KTVU.) Despite a programming inventory comparable to other independents (including holding rights to San Francisco Giants baseball games), SCS was unsuccessful in marketing KTVU to cable systems to reach the level of WTBS, WGN-TV and WOR-TV. In April 1980, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment purchased the transponder space from SCS to distribute upstart music video channel MTV; KTVU&#x27;s national cable distribution would be reduced to systems that already carried the station in the Western United States by early 1981.

Eastern Microwave was somewhat more successful in distributing WOR-TV (which had been available to cable and CATV systems via microwave throughout much of the Northeastern United States since 1965), when it began retransmitting the New York station&#x27;s signal to cable affiliates and C-band satellite receivers throughout the remainder of the country over transponder 17 of Satcom I in April 1979. Until WOR adopted a 24-hour schedule in 1980, the satellite feed initially included a backup feed of CBS-owned New York City station WCBS-TV (channel 2) during WOR&#x27;s off-hours. Even though WOR had a similar film library as other superstations (further boosted by the acquisition of the Universal Pictures film library when MCA Inc. acquired the station in a $387-million deal with the legally embattled RKO General in April 1987) and held rights to events from several New York-area professional sports teams (including the New York Mets, the New York Rangers, the New Jersey Devils and the New York Knicks as well as college basketball games involving Big East Conference universities), the station&#x27;s distribution—while broad—was still relatively regionally scattered and paced far behind that of WTBS and WGN well into the 1990s.

United Video would eventually gain an oligopoly in superstation distribution throughout the 1980s, building on its success with WGN-TV by commencing distribution of three other superstations and handling marketing responsibilities for one more (including three that were owned by then-WGN parent Tribune Broadcasting). On May 1, 1984, United Video—which picked up the station&#x27;s satellite retransmission rights from Southern Satellite Systems—uplinked the signal of WPIX to the Westar V satellite; this was followed on July 1, 1984, with its uplink of the signal of KTVT in Dallas–Fort Worth to the Satcom IV satellite, in a move undertaken by then-owner Gaylord Broadcasting to persuade cable providers that either already imported or were considering receiving the station&#x27;s signal by microwave to begin transmitting the KTVT satellite feed. (United Video would later relocate KTVT&#x27;s transponder to the Spacenet III in December 1988.) On October 24, 1987, Netlink—then a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI)—began distributing KWGN-TV (channel 2, now a CW affiliate) over Satcom I as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Denver 5&quot; direct-to-home package of television stations from Colorado&#x27;s state capital that also included five default network feeds for home dish subscribers without access to a local network affiliate: NBC owned-and-operated station KCNC-TV (channel 4, now a CBS owned-and-operated station), ABC affiliate KUSA-TV (channel 9, now an NBC affiliate), CBS affiliate KMGH-TV (channel 7, now an ABC affiliate), PBS station KRMA-TV (channel 6) and Fox affiliate KDVR (channel 31). (KWGN&#x27;s satellite feed was limited in its availability to home dish users; although, at its peak, the station itself had cable carriage throughout Colorado&#x27;s Western Slope, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.)

On February 15, 1988, Eastern Microwave Inc. began distributing WSBK-TV and KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles via the Satcom I-R satellite. (WSBK-TV was selected primarily for its broadcasts of Boston Bruins hockey and Boston Red Sox baseball games, while KTLA was selected for its broadcasts of Los Angeles Clippers basketball and California Angels baseball games.) EMI chose to encourage rather than compel cable systems in the Northeastern U.S. that already received WSBK by microwave to begin receiving the satellite feed, and outsourced marketing of the signals to home dish owners through HBO and TEMPO Enterprises. Both superstations were notable for being the first to have their signals scrambled from the outset, using the Videocipher II encryption system as well as the second and third EMI-delivered superstations to be encrypted, after having converted the WWOR satellite signal to an encrypted format in March 1986. (Within two months of EMI making the station available via satellite, United Video assumed marketing rights for KTLA under a partnership with Eastern Microwave.) Both services had their distribution limited primarily to the home dish market, whereas their cable distribution remained confined to their respective regions (New England for WSBK and the Southwestern United States for KTLA).

Unlike with WTCG/WTBS, Tribune Broadcasting (owners of WGN-TV, WPIX, KTLA and KWGN-TV until the completion of Tribune&#x27;s purchase by Nexstar Media Group and concurring spin-off of WPIX to the E. W. Scripps Company in September 2019, with both successor parents inheriting the classification for those stations) and the various owners of WSBK (Gillett Communications, Paramount Stations Group and CBS Television Stations) have treated their satellite-delivered stations as &quot;passive&quot; superstations, opting to assert a neutral position over the relay of its signal by an intermediate common carrier to a national audience and leaving national promotional duties for multichannel television services and their subscribers to the satellite carriers that retransmitted their signals; in kind, neither station received direct compensation from United Video or EMI for retransmission or promotion of their signals but received royalty payments paid by carrier cable systems to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) for their retransmission of programs that are copyrighted in the name of the individual stations and/or their respective parent companies. This benefited the stations as it allowed them to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks.

Even so, WGN would gradually switch to a more &quot;active&quot; stance in later years; Tribune began relaying the station&#x27;s Chicago broadcast feed to United Video directly in 1985, and eventually acquired a majority stake in the rechristened TV Guide Inc.&#x27;s UVTV satellite unit in April 2001 as the company was spinning off its satellite carrier assets to focus on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s magazine, direct-to-cable program listings and interactive program guide services. Tribune, as a whole, had also shifted from opposing satellite retransmission of its stations sans permission to weighing in the benefits of having its stations be distributed to a wide audience, to the point of being in strong opposition against the reimposition of the syndicated exclusivity rules and filing court proceedings against major sports leagues that sought to prevent game telecasts involving local NBA and Major League Baseball teams from being imported to other media markets.

===Distant signal regulation and conflicts===
During the 1960s, the FCC began to severely restrict the importation of distant signals by larger CATV and cable systems, limiting their distribution to smaller-market and rural systems, based in part on the framework of the 1963 &quot;Carter Mountain Transmission Corp. v. FCC&quot; case, which stemmed from a legal challenge by Chief Washakie TV, then-owner of KWRB-TV (channel 10, now KFNE and operating a satellite station of Casper Fox affiliate KLWY) in Riverton, Wyoming, against the FCC license of Cody-based microwave relay firm Carter Mountain Transmission Corp., which intended to relay the signal of CBS/NBC affiliate KTWO-TV (channel 2) in Casper, Wyoming to CATV systems in three cities that were within the range of KWRB&#x27;s off-air signal: Riverton, Lander and Thermopolis. The FCC&#x27;s denial of Carter&#x27;s license renewal—because of its refusal to guarantee KWRB program duplication protection and the harm it would induce to the station, especially given Carter&#x27;s refusal to offer the KWRB signal—was affirmed in a unanimous, three-judge decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on May 24, 1963, and a consideration refusal on the case by the U.S. Supreme Court on December 19.

Further expansion of &quot;proto-superstation&quot; signals came through federal court rulings on separate lawsuits filed in July 1961 by United Artists and WSTV Inc. (then-owner of WSTV [channel 9, now WTOV-TV] in Steubenville, Ohio) over Fortnightly Corp.&#x27;s importation of television stations from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Wheeling, West Virginia–Steubenville, Ohio markets to its Fairmont and Clarksburg, West Virginia systems and in December 1964 by CBS (over TelePrompTer&#x27;s importation of stations from New York City, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Billings, Montana and Denver, Colorado to its systems in Elmira, New York, Johnstown, Pennsylvania and Farmington, New Mexico). In the former case, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5–1 vote on June 18, 1968, that CATV systems like Fortnightly did not incur copyright liability by retransmitting distant signals as they acted more akin to &quot;viewers&quot; than broadcasters; the latter case, ruled on May 2, 1972, by Judge Constance Baker Motley of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, affirmed that stance based on the Supreme Court&#x27;s framework on the &quot;Fortnightly v. United Artists&quot; case.

On March 31, 1972, the FCC implemented a broad package of cable industry regulations passed that February, which included two rules pertaining to distant signal importation. Among the implemented rules was the original incarnation of the Syndication Exclusivity Rules (or &quot;SyndEx&quot;), which required cable providers to black out any syndicated programs carried on out-of-market stations if a television station exclusively holds the local broadcast rights to a particular program, even if the out-of-market station has the same owner as the program&#x27;s claimant station. The main difference between the original Syndex law and the version enacted in 1988 was that the blackout provisions applied to almost all programming, including special event programs distributed through syndication (such as the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; and the &quot;Easter Seals Telethon&quot;). The distant signal regulations allowed cable systems in the 100 largest markets to carry imported signals as a matter of right (including the addition of two distant signals not already available in the market), restricted cable systems in smaller markets to only being able to carry three network stations and one independent station (except for undefinable markets that would not be limited in the number of carried imported signals), and instituted leapfrogging rules that required systems importing distant independent stations from the top-25 markets to choose from one or both of the two markets closest to the provider&#x27;s city of license and any systems carrying the signal of a third independent being required to pick up a UHF or, if such a station is not available, VHF station located within a radius. This interpretation of the rules became increasingly difficult to enforce as the number of cable-originated services increased, particularly following the emergence of communications satellites as a distribution method to the cable industry beginning in 1975.

FCC soon began outlining a regulatory framework that allowed cable systems to import some out-of-market signals without running into copyright liability. In August 1975, the agency began allowing unlimited signal importation upon either the final daily sign-off of a local &quot;must carry&quot; station or starting at 1:00 a.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time)/12:00 a.m. (in all other time zones), to avoid programming conflicts with late-night programing being carried &quot;in progress&quot; or avoid instances in which systems would have to run a blank screen until the start of the next program. As such, the distant signal would act as a timeshare feed on a cable channel otherwise occupied by a local or out-of-market broadcast station during the occupying station&#x27;s normal sign-off period. The last major obstacle to the creation of a national superstation was knocked down on December 19, 1975, when the FCC unanimously voted to repeal a 1972 rule requiring cable systems selecting a distant signal from among television stations in the top-25 media markets to only select a station from one of the two closest markets to the licensed system. The FCC Cable Television Bureau contended the formation of superstations was unlikely due to the absence of evidence that television stations economically benefited from cable carriage.

On October 1, 1976, the U.S. Congress unanimously passed the Copyright Act of 1976 in separate Senate floor and House voice votes. The law provides cable systems with a compulsory license – which, under Section 111, also applies to &quot;passive&quot; (passthrough) satellite carriers, allowing them to retransmit &quot;copyrighted programming from any over-the-air [television and radio] stations across the country [or, with range restrictions based on their distance from the U.S. border, from Canada or Mexico]&quot; without seeking the originating station&#x27;s express permission – that requires payment of a flat semi-annual royalty fee based both on the number of distant signals retransmitted by the system and on their total subscriber receipts (0.675% of their gross receipts for the first distant signal, 0.425% for any other signal up to the fourth and 0.2% for each signal beyond the fourth, with a separate fixed-rate exemptions for systems that have a semi-annual revenue either below $80,000 or between $80,000 and $160,000), prohibits any modifications to the imported broadcast signal and its copyrighted content (such as commercials substituted by the cable system, permitting local broadcast stations to sue the systems if violating modifications are made), and established the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, a five-member commission of the U.S. Copyright Office that is tasked with reviewing cable and other royalty rates every five years (or sooner, if changes to program exclusivity or signal importation rules are made by the FCC) and compensates eligible owners of a copyrighted program who submit a written claim to receive the mandatory royalty paid by the cable system. Compulsory license rules for broadcast signal distribution were extended to the home satellite industry on October 21, 1988, through the passage of Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, which also restricted access to network programs exclusively to home dish users in &quot;white areas&quot; where broadcast signals are unviewable via antenna or cable (a provision that would become pertinent to most of the remaining superstations following network launches that took place in 1995).

The distribution of these superstations eventually caused conflicts between these stations and providers of similar, or identical, programming in local markets. Among the earliest opponents to the emergence of superstations was the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which in 1977, with the growing distribution of WTCG, petitioned the FCC to investigate the impact of and regulate superstations amid concerns over the potential financial losses for programs that MPAA member companies distributed to other television stations, which it posited would not be offset by royalty payments by cable systems. (The MPAA, which had its inquiry petition backed by the National Association of Broadcasters [NAB] and broadcasting companies such as Kelly Broadcasting, McGraw-Hill Broadcasting and Taft Television &amp; Radio Company, also lodged an unsuccessful bit to deny SSS&#x27;s application to grant an expansion of WTCG&#x27;s service to Puerto Rico, Alaska and Canada.)

On October 25, 1978, the FCC implemented an &quot;open entry&quot; policy for satellite resale carriers wanting to feed local television stations to cable systems, a move that would pave the way for the emergence of additional superstations. The policy also commenced review on FCC applications filed by four individual satellite carriers to authorize relay of other independent stations through the Satcom satellite fleet:
* Southern Satellite Systems – seeking to carry KTTV (channel 11, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in Los Angeles and WPIX (channel 11, now a CW affiliate) in New York City;
* Satellite Communication Systems (a joint venture of Holiday Inns and SSS) – seeking to relay KTVU in Oakland–San Francisco;
* Eastern Microwave Inc. (a subsidiary of Newhouse Newspapers) – seeking to relay WOR-TV (channel 9, now Secaucus, New Jersey-licensed MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV) in New York City and WSBK-TV (channel 38, now an independent station) in Boston;
* and United Video, which also sought to relay WOR (without an overnight backup feed) and WSBK.
Reactions to the FCC&#x27;s 1978 &quot;open entry&quot; policy ruling among program distributors ranged from &quot;anger to passive acceptance,&quot; with concerns that satellite-distributed superstations would not adequately compensate program syndicators based on the acquired program&#x27;s national availability and provide difficulty for program sales once content was sold to broadcasters in smaller markets with superstation importation via cable. Then on November 4, the FCC rescinded a provision requiring cable systems seeking a waiver of signal importation limits to prove the unique circumstances that justified the waiver, while still requiring them to show that local stations would not suffer adverse public service impacts as a result of ratings or revenue losses from the imported signal, an action that was considered a greenlight to the creation of additional national superstations.

While most superstations took on a passive stance on their distribution—programming to their local audience while benefiting tacitly from their extended distribution—a small number attempted to fight efforts to be redistributed; in March 1979, Metromedia—which was fighting an FCC grant allowing ASN Inc. (which also had been given permission to uplink WGN-TV and WOR-TV) to make KTTV an &quot;involuntary superstation,&quot; claiming such retransmission would be a violation of a provision of Section 325 of the Communications Act that prohibited signal retransmission without a broadcaster&#x27;s express consent, even though Section 111 of the 1976 Copyright Act effectively allowed such importation – asked the FCC to temporarily halt all authority for the satellite distribution and marketing of superstation signals. Concurrent with the Metromedia petition, the NAB—later to be joined in the petition by, among others, the MPAA, the NBA, the National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, WGN Continental Broadcasting and ABC—urged the FCC to conduct an expedited rulemaking aimed at curbing &quot;the harmful impact of superstation development on broadcast program service to the public,&quot; positing that they posed a serious threat to the ability of program producers to guarantee exclusive local rights to prospective stations seeking to buy programs being offered on the syndication market. ASN rebutted that KTTV had acknowledged the company was being authorized to redistribute its programming without distributor permission as the station could not do it on its own without shouldering liability. The issue was never fully settled, however, as ASN Inc. ceased operations amid financial issues before it could be able to retransmit KTTV&#x27;s signal.

The FCC repealed its remaining cable television regulations in a 4–3 vote on July 22, 1980, eliminating its restrictions on the number of broadcast stations that cable systems could carry and syndication exclusivity protections for local television stations on the basis that &quot;local stations are not adversely affected when a cable system offers subscribers signals from television stations in other cities.&quot; The repeal of its signal importation and Syndex rules resulted in many cable systems beginning to carry other national superstations and additional regional out-of-market independents. The following day (July 23), television station owner Malrite Broadcasting (later Malrite Communications) filed a lawsuit in United States Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of New York to stop the rules from going into effect. The National Association of Broadcasters and Field Communications subsequently filed stay motions to the FCC (which denied the requests) until the Malrite suit was adjudicated, amid concerns over harm that the repeal could incur to station revenue and local viewership of syndicated programs if the same program could be duplicated by superstations and other distant signals. On June 19, 1981, the three-judge New York Court of Appeals panel unanimously affirmed the distant signal and syndication exclusivity repeals; after multiple delays, the repeal of both regulations went into effect one week later on June 24. The U.S. Supreme Court also affirmed the repeal by declining a request by the NAB to review the FCC order in January 1982.

Interpretations of the copyright act also led to legal cases against superstation distributors. In April 1981, Tribune Broadcasting filed a copyright infringement suit against United Video in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on grounds that United inserted teletext content from its Dow Jones business news service over the satellite feed&#x27;s vertical blanking interval (VBI) during retransmissions of WGN&#x27;s newscasts and other local programs in place of the teletext listings data that the station was relaying to United&#x27;s Electronic Program Guide (EPG) service (later Prevue Guide and now the entertainment-based Pop) in violation of the Copyright Act&#x27;s passive carrier rules. In October 1981, District Court Judge Susan Getzendanner denied an injunction to WGN Continental Broadcasting and dismissed the United Video case, determining that United was not required to carry the station&#x27;s teletext transmission. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Northern District of Illinois disagreed, ruling in August 1982 that United Video must retransmit WGN-TV&#x27;s VBI teletext where directly related to and part of the 9:00 p.m. news simulcast, noting that United had no grounds to claim the unseen teletext exempted it from copyright liability as the Copyright Act&#x27;s definition of what constitutes as a public performance was broad enough to encompass indirect transmission through cable affiliates.

The MPAA, the NAB (despite its insistence that the CRT had limited to no authority to set rates outside the mandatory five-year interval), sports leagues and other copyright holders soon asked the Copyright Office to hike its royalty rates to compensate for the loss of the distant signal carriage and syndication exclusivity deregulation. On October 22, 1982, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal instituted a statutory license rate adjustment, establishing a 3.75% royalty fee of a cable system&#x27;s gross receipts from subscribers (if their semi-annual revenue exceeds $214,000) for carriage of each previously impermissible distant signal and a SyndEx surcharge for programs transmitted on a previously blackout-subjected imported signal that was added after the rules were repealed, alongside existing royalties paid to the CRT &quot;Basic Fund&quot;. The increase met with backlash from cable industry executives and lobbyists, led by National Cable Television Association (NCTA) President Tom Wheeler, who were concerned that it would result in the removal of superstations and other distant signals as well as harm independent stations supported by the extended audience. By the time the fees were imposed on March 15 (which was dubbed by cable systems as &quot;Black Tuesday for Cable Viewers&quot;), NCTA estimates showed that about 6.3 million subscribers nationwide had lost access to one or more distant signals because of defections by cable systems that wanted to avoid paying the increased copyright fees. Dating back weeks prior to the deadline (as some systems chose to remove imported signals after the CRT delayed the fee imposition), various distant signals experienced a combined loss of 493 cable clearances, with WTBS, WGN-TV and WOR-TV making up half the defections with a combined loss of 249 clearances. Other cable-originated services benefited from the fee increases and distant signal defections, with the Cable Health Network (CHN; merged with Daytime in 1984 to form Lifetime) experiencing the most growth; by March 1983, 1.2 million of the 9.1 million subscribers that CHN had at the time came from cable systems that replaced a distant signal with the channel. (Later estimates showed that WTBS lost 320,000 subscribers, while Eastern Microwave recouped around 200,000 subscribers for WOR and United Video recouped around 600,000 of its CRT-related losses of 1.2 million subscribers by May 1983.)

On May 18, 1988, the FCC passed a new version of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule. The new policy—spurred in part by a 1987 study conducted by the Association of Independent Television Stations (INTV), which provided evidence that programming duplication between superstations and local stations created significant ratings dilution for the latter group in certain time periods and a resulting significant loss of advertising revenue—not only allowed television stations to claim local exclusivity over syndicated programs (even if the out-of-market station has the same owner as the station with that particular exclusive program) and required cable systems to black out claimed programs; it also granted cable systems or carrier firms the ability to secure an agreement with the claimant station or a syndication distributor to continue carrying a claimed program through an out-of-market station, allowing some superstations to acquire partial or exclusive national cable rights to certain programs. The law also closed the terrestrial loophole that allowed superstations like WGN and WTBS to continue paying local single market rates for programming acquisitions even as they were gaining national coverage, whilst selling that extended coverage to advertisers; this change made it so that other local stations which had their signals beamed to a satellite transponder – whether willingly or not – were charged appropriately for program content based on their actual national distribution, depending on arrangements with any given syndicator.

A major concern brought about by the new rules was that it would force cable systems to drop certain superstations altogether, rather than shoulder expenses that would be incurred with the resultant blackouts and any responsibilities for acquiring substitute programming, thereby denying viewers access to sporting events popular among subscribers who received those signals. In preparation for the policy&#x27;s implementation – which took effect on January 1, 1990, after FCC-enforced delays in the regulation&#x27;s rollout – some superstations decided to indemnify cable systems from potential blackouts by ensuring that, at least, some programs that could be subjected to local syndication exclusivity claims could continue to be shown to their national audience, so as to prevent the loss of sports access. WTBS effectively limited the number of necessary blackouts or substitutions by licensing the majority of its programming for carriage on both its national and Atlanta area feeds. (Certain local programs carried by the station, such as public affairs and educational children&#x27;s programs, were not carried on the TBS national feed, but these omissions were because those programs were strictly intended to fulfill local obligations for public affairs content.)

United Video and Eastern Microwave respectively opted to devise standalone national feeds of WGN and WWOR, each incorporating an alternate schedule differing from the local broadcast signal to some degree—comprising both programs aired by the parent station for which the companies were able to secure the national retransmission rights (including some held over from before the SyndEx law was enacted), and supplementary programs acquired specifically for the national cable feed to absolve any holes caused by exclusivity claims—as well as separate national advertising, and in the case of WWOR, local advertising sold by individual cable systems. This would be achieved by &quot;splitting&quot; the signal, often requiring the use of a separate transponder to switch between the local feed and the alternate programming feed, so that certain programs viewed in the station&#x27;s home market could be easily replaced with separate content that would only be shown over the national cable feed. While United Video made efforts to clear as much of the programming seen on the WGN Chicago feed as it possibly could, EMI increasingly filled the national WWOR EMI Service feed with library content distributed by Universal Television, MGM Television and Quinn Martin—consisting of classic television series from the 1950s to the 1970s—as well as select programs from the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; television service, alongside shows on WWOR&#x27;s local program schedule that it was able to acquire retransmission rights at the national level (including local newscasts, sports and other WWOR-produced programming as well as special events, the station&#x27;s overnight simulcast of the Shop at Home Network and a limited number of syndicated shows that did not have exclusivity claims in any market). Confusingly for WWOR&#x27;s national cable viewers, on-air promotions for programs not contracted to air nationally over the EMI Service were shown unaltered during simulcasts of programs aired on the New York signal. (This was not an issue with the WGN national feed, as United Video chose to substitute program promotions for shows airing on the Chicago signal that were not cleared on the national feed with those for the replacement shows exclusively seen on the latter, albeit still using station logos and promotional graphics used by the Chicago broadcast feed).

To blunt potential subscriber complaints over widespread programming blackouts, many cable systems removed both regional and quasi-national superstations (like WSBK, WPIX and KTVT) as well as other distant signals that their satellite carriers were unable or unwilling to take immediate steps to ensure their programming was &quot;Syndex-proofed&quot; to avoid blackouts. WGN and WTBS saw little negative impact to their distribution following the Syndex implementation, with WGN actually heavily benefiting from provider removals of other superstations (including then sister station WPIX) during the early 1990s, allowing for further expansion of its distribution reach. EMI estimated simultaneous losses of 500,000 subscribers and an increase of around one million households to its cable distribution of WWOR, the latter being attributed to some local cable systems adding the Syndex-proof WWOR EMI Service feed. Most complaints over the removal of some regional and quasi-national superstations were because of the loss of access to coverage from regional professional sports teams (such as the Boston Red Sox via WSBK, the Texas Rangers and Dallas Mavericks via KTVT and the New York Yankees via WPIX), leading some systems to resort to cherrypicking sports from the removed superstations to mollify subscribers and local politicians acceding to complaints from their constituents by pushing other cable systems to seek solutions to resume sporting events lost through the removal of those superstations. (For example, amid public pressure from the Providence City Council and Rhode Island Department of Public Utilities and Carriers, Dimension Cable Services&#x27;s Providence, Rhode Island system [now operated by Cox Communications], which removed the 24-hour WPIX feed upon the Syndex rollout, began placing the station&#x27;s Yankees telecasts on a local origination channel in May 1990, in exchange for paying United Video full-time copyright fees.) The WWOR EMI Service—despite having SyndEx-proofed its programming schedule—and WPIX would each see their distribution erode during the early 1990s, as some of the cable affiliates that carried either superstation began replacing them with the WGN national feed.

The passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988 on October 19, 1988, extended the compulsory license to direct-to-home (DTH) satellite services, protecting distribution of broadcast signals to dish owners under existing copyright statutes. (The act&#x27;s provisions primarily benefited so-called &quot;affiliate superstations,&quot; provided that the distant network stations could only be distributed to &quot;unserved households&quot; that were unable to receive a local affiliate off-air.) For many years after the passage of SyndEx for cable systems, the satellite television industry remained exempt from syndication exclusivity regulations, resulting in subscribers of direct broadcast satellite and C-Band providers continuing to be able to view all programming seen on the local broadcast signals of national and regional superstations (except where the provider already offered the SyndEx-compliant cable feed). An FCC inquiry on whether SyndEx rules should be applied to home dish services concluded in January 1991 that extending those rules to satellite &quot;would be technically and economically infeasible&quot; as equipment that would allow programs to be selectively blacked out based on the media market would not likely be marketed until after the initial compulsory license expired in 1994 and that the expense of &quot;preventing viewing by a relatively few authorized home satellite dish owners for a relatively short period&quot; would be greater than that incurred by cable providers.

Copyright laws pertaining to broadcast signal carriage by satellite providers were eventually overhauled through amendments to the Communications Act of 1996 that were added through the November 1999 implementation of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA), which allowed satellite providers to carry local broadcast signals on the Congressionally-suggested condition that the FCC develop rules protecting the sports, network and syndicated programming rights of local broadcasters. On November 2, 2000, the FCC approved identical network non-duplication, syndication exclusivity and sports blackout rules applying to the six FCC-designated national superstations (WGN-TV, KTLA, WPIX, KWGN-TV, WSBK-TV and WWOR-TV) and, in the case of the sports blackouts, other distant signals retransmitted over home dish units to an extent where it would be &quot;technically feasible and not economically prohibitive;&quot; this statute would eventually limit distribution of the five grandfathered stations to rural areas without distributors of similar programming. The rules, which took effect on November 30 and also applied to satellite common carriers that uplinked and distributed the superstations, gave satellite providers at least four months to implement duplication protections for network and syndicated programs and 60 days notice to comply with sports and programming blackout requests. An exemption to the Communications Act&#x27;s retransmission consent statute in the SHVIA rules allowed satellite carriers to retransmit a superstation signal absent the station&#x27;s prior written consent under the latter two aspects of the aforementioned FCC-defined &quot;national superstation&quot; criteria, provided that the service complies with the non-duplication, syndication exclusivity and sports blackout rules. (TBS was not covered under the SHVIA&#x27;s de facto distant signal grandfathering clause as its national feed was considered a technically separate entity from its over-the-air parent feed in Atlanta. The act&#x27;s network non-duplication and Syndex rules were thought to negatively affect the distribution of WGN as its national feed was compliant with those restrictions.) The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), signed into law on December 8, 2004, allowed satellite providers to carry &quot;significantly viewed&quot; superstations and distant network signals to subscribers royalty-free and with the payment of retransmission consent, provided that the subscriber also receives local stations from the provider, and permitted providers to deliver superstations to commercial businesses.

==== Conflicts with professional sports leagues ====
Much of the appeal of superstations to viewers came from the national carriage of sporting events involving professional league teams that contracted their telecasts to the originating stations within home markets. Although professional sports teams benefited heavily from their national exposure—especially with regards to WTCG/WTBS&#x27;s carriage of the Atlanta Braves and the Atlanta Hawks, and WGN-TV&#x27;s broadcasts of sporting events featuring the Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls—superstation broadcasts of National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) games were met with resistance from league commissioners, who contended these telecasts—regardless of the positive effects on team loyalty—diluted the value of their national television contracts with other broadcast and cable networks. Some superstation operators (like Ted Turner and former Tribune Company vice president John Madigan) note a lack of corroborating evidence of any negative effects on game attendance and league revenue, suggesting that sports leagues have used superstation telecasts of their games as a scapegoat for financial problems incurred by the league caused by other factors such as the performance of certain teams and management issues.

The only federal restrictions applying to sports events shown on superstations and other imported signals was the so-called &quot;same-game rule,&quot; enacted by the FCC in June 1975 to prohibit cable systems from retransmitting a sports event through a distant signal within a zone around the city of the home team&#x27;s arena if the game is not airing on a local television broadcaster, with a subsequent amendment requiring the broadcast rights-holder to inform local cable systems of game deletions no later than Monday of the preceding calendar week of the proposed deletion. (Other leagues had proposed a broader blackout zone: the National Hockey League [NHL] suggested that the protection zone should be extended across a team&#x27;s entire home market, while the National Football League [NFL] and Major League Baseball each advocated for a zone, with the latter also seeking a zone around the cities of minor league franchises and a zone around a team&#x27;s local television rights-holder.) The major professional sports leagues eventually imposed their own broadcasting restrictions around the number of games that could air annually on any out-of-market stations, which resulted in superstations sometimes substituting sports events with syndicated programming and feature films in adherence. (This had an adverse effect on WGN, WWOR and WPIX, which each had news departments, as some of their respective newscasts would be subjected to substitutions if a sports event—particularly one shown during prime time—was preempted.)

One of the first known legal efforts to challenge superstation telecasts of sports events came in April 1981, when Eastern Microwave Inc. filed a declaratory judgement inquiry in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, contending that its cable retransmissions of WOR&#x27;s New York Mets telecasts did not constitute copyright infringement. Mets owner Doubleday Sports Inc. contended it had the right to control the telecasts outside of its home market and informed EMI that the telecasts would be recorded upon transmission, effectively subjecting them to copyright by Doubleday; EMI contended that it was exempt from paying royalties for the telecasts under Section 111 (a) (3) of the Copyright Act, which contends that the secondary transmission of a program by an intermediary carrier did not infringe upon a copyright if the carrier had &quot;no direct or indirect control over the content or selection of the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission,&quot; and if the carrier&#x27;s transmission activities only pertained to providing &quot;wires, cables or other communications channels for the use of others.&quot; On March 12, 1982, District Judge Neal P. McCurn ruled that EMI and other satellite carriers were liable for royalty payments to program suppliers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (in a reversal of the Central District Court decision on October 20) and the Supreme Court (in a February 25, 1983, decision refusing review of the case) both concurred with EMI&#x27;s arguments, holding that the company constituted as a &quot;passive&quot; carrier exempt from copyright fee payments—along with noting that EMI had only one available transponder for its extraterrestrial services and &quot;naturally&quot; sought to re-transmit &quot;a marketable station&quot;—under the Copyright Act&#x27;s existing structure.

Outside of the teams that benefited from the broader exposure the telecasts gave them, Major League Baseball had long felt that superstations ate into their ability to gain revenue from agreements with national networks like ESPN. (As a comparison, in 1992, ESPN televised 175 baseball games as part of a broader $100-million-per year deal at a per-game cost of $571,428, about 12 times more than what TBS, WGN, WWOR and WPIX paid cumulatively for their respective team-based packages that year, encompassing a combined 435 games for an annual fee of $20 million or a per-game cost of $46,000). A succession of three MLB Commissioners—which, among the position&#x27;s responsibilities, handles negotiations for all national broadcasting contracts but is prohibited under the federal compulsory license law from controlling carriage of superstation telecasts—attempted to curb the telecasts or convince superstations to pay a higher fee for the national telecasts to varying success. After Bowie Kuhn was appointed Commissioner in 1981, team owners lobbied the league to place a tax on superstation telecasts; the proposed tax passed in a 24–2 vote (with the Braves and the Cubs dissenting). Other legal attempts by Kuhn and league management to reduce the superstation telecasts ultimately failed because of federal copyright laws that protected the broadcasts. The tax was implemented in January 1985, under successor Peter Ueberroth, with Ted Turner becoming the first MLB team owner to agree to the revenue-sharing plan, under which he made annual contributions to the league&#x27;s Central Fund for the continued right to carry Braves baseball games over WTBS. The Tribune Company (then-owner of WGN and WPIX, the former of which cited its absent accounting of its national cable audience in its advertising rates for its initial participation reluctance, as well as the Cubs), MCA Inc. (then owner of WWOR) and Gaylord Broadcasting (then owner of KTVT) soon each agreed to contribute to the fund for the right to air Cubs, White Sox, Yankees, Mets and Rangers games outside the teams&#x27; respective home markets. (The total payment reflected the reach of each superstation; by 1992, Turner and the Cubs paid $12 million and $6 million, respectively, reflecting WTBS&#x27;s 58-million subscriber audience and WGN&#x27;s 35 million subscribers at the time, whereas WWOR and WPIX each chipped in only $1 million, better reflecting their more regionalized distribution.).

Concerns by many of Major League Baseball team owners that the share would be used to buoy the expansion of KTVT into a fourth national superstation (a move that would have had to be undertaken by United Video as it was the station&#x27;s satellite redistributor), American League team owners voted down Gaylord Broadcasting President Edward L. Gaylord&#x27;s initial bid to purchase 33% of the Texas Rangers on January 11, 1985, in a 9–5 confirmation vote (below the two-thirds votes needed to approve the sale). Ueberroth would invoke a &quot;best interests of baseball&quot; clause on February 8 to approve the sale and associated broadcast contract with KTVT, which required Gaylord Broadcasting to pay re-transmission fees for games that the station televised outside of its six-state cable footprint. Similar issues also prevented Gaylord from buying the 58% interest by majority-owner Eddie Chiles, a share that Chiles would ultimately sell in a $46-million deal to an ownership group led by eventual Texas Governor and U.S. President George W. Bush, real estate developer H. Bert Mack and investor Frank L. Morsani in April 1989.

Ueberroth&#x27;s successor, Fay Vincent, took a more hard-line approach against baseball telecasts shown over superstations. During his two-year tenure as league commissioner, he tried to introduce contract language in local broadcast agreements that would allow a team to terminate the contract if broadcasts were re-transmitted &quot;by any means&quot; to more than 200,000 homes outside the team&#x27;s territory, launched a petition to the FCC to redefine how its non-duplication rules constitute a &quot;network program&quot; to force cable systems to blackout superstation-licensed live sports broadcasts, and asked Congress for the repeal the compulsory copyright license and the inclusion of an amendment to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 that would force superstations to enforce blackouts of sporting events if a conflict occurred with a local telecast of the same game. (The latter amendment spurred an on-air campaign by Turner Broadcasting, which saw responses, mostly opposed to the proposed legislation, by more than 17,000 viewers.) Then in July 1992, in a move seen by some as targeting the Cubs&#x27; WGN telecasts, Vincent ordered a realignment of the National League (NL) that sought to move the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals to the National League West and the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds to the National League East starting with the 1993 season. Tribune staunchly opposed the proposed realignment, filing a breach of contract lawsuit accusing Vincent of overstepping his authority in ordering the realignment and arguing it would dilute existing team rivalries. (The realignment proposal also sparked concerns that local advertising revenue for WGN&#x27;s prime time newscast would be depressed by frequent post-9:00 p.m. Central Time] delays during the regular season from an increased number of Cubs games involving Pacific Time Zone-based Western Division teams starting in the late evening in the eastern half of the country. The Braves as well as the Cubs&#x27; American League [AL] rivals, the Chicago White Sox, had each already played many late-evening [Eastern/Central Time] games during the regular and postseason against West Coast teams in the western divisions of the National and American Leagues.) U.S. District Judge Suzanne B. Conlon issued a preliminary injunction in favor of Tribune and the Cubs on July 23, 1992, six weeks prior to an 18-9-1 motion of no confidence against Vincent among team owners on September 4. Impacts to baseball&#x27;s attempts to curb superstation telecasts were felt following Vincent&#x27;s subsequent resignation as MLB Commissioner on September 7, 1992; one week after his departure, the proposed blackout amendment failed to make a Cable Television Act reconciliation bill due to the lack of support for the provision in the Senate.

The NBA also undertook actions to limit superstation telecasts of the league&#x27;s games. In 1982, it began prohibiting television stations that reached at least 5% of all out-of-market cable households from airing games that conflicted with those shown on the league&#x27;s national cable partners (at the time, ESPN and USA Network); this transitioned in June 1985 to a 25-game limit on the number of seasonal NBA telecasts that could be licensed to superstations (sixteen fewer than the 41-game maximum under existing NBA local broadcast rules). Concerned with the potential impact that the concurring returns of the Chicago Bulls and the Atlanta Hawks to WGN and WTBS, respectively, would have on its national contracts with NBC and ESPN, in April 1990, NBA Commissioner David Stern further reduced the amount of superstation-licensed NBA telecasts to 20 games per season. This sparked a 5½-year legal battle against the NBA by Tribune Broadcasting and Chicago Bulls parent Chicago Professional Sports L.P. The conspiracy and antitrust lawsuit filed by the co-plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on October 16, 1990, alleged that the 20-game limit was aimed at &quot;phas[ing] out such superstations telecasts entirely in increments of five games each year over the next five years,&quot; a separate plan proposed by Stern that was never voted upon by NBA team owners. (The NBA contended the restriction was exempt from antitrust law under a provision of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which was deemed in later rulings to only be applicable to the sale or transfer a national game package to a television network and not those involving individual teams.) After four separate rulings in favor of Tribune and the Bulls issued by Northern District Judge Hubert L. Will (on January 26, 1991, and January 6, 1995), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (on April 14, 1992), and the U.S. Supreme Court (on November 5, 1992), a Seventh Circuit judiciary panel overturned their 1992 ruling on September 10, 1996, which forced WGN-TV – which had been allowed to air at least 30 Bulls telecasts over its local and national feeds between the 1992–93 and 1995–96 seasons per agreement between the lawsuit parties – to relegate the 35 Bulls games it was scheduled to air during the 1996–97 season exclusively to the Chicago area signal. (The embargoed Bulls telecasts were supplanted on the WGN superstation feed by syndicated feature films, and caused the national preemption of the station&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. newscast on nights when prime time games overran into the time slot.) Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI, now defunct) cited the national restrictions on the Bulls as partly being behind its December 1996 decision to remove the WGN national feed from most of its systems throughout the country, affecting around 3.5 million TCI subscribers by March 1997, though criticism over the move led TCI to rescind its plans to remove the WGN national feed from affected systems in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan with the remaining systems reinstating WGN through 1999. The Bulls, WGN and the NBA reached a settlement on December 12, 1996, allowing WGN-TV to air the league broadcast maximum of 41 games for the remainder of the 1996–97 season (35 that would air only on the Chicago signal and twelve that would be shown on both the local and superstation feeds). From the 1997–98 season thereafter, the number of games permitted to air on the superstation feed increased to 15 per year. The parties also agreed to replace the NBA&#x27;s licensing tax for superstations with a revenue sharing model, under which the NBA would collect 50% of all advertising revenue accrued from the national WGN telecasts.

TBS was able to work around these issues by supplementing its Atlanta-originated sports broadcasts with more nationalized sports fare, including a package of regular season NBA games involving the league&#x27;s other teams, early round conference playoff games and the NBA draft (beginning with the 1984–85 season and continuing until Turner Broadcasting shifted the NBA cable rights to sister channel TNT in 2002), professional wrestling programs from several promotions (including Georgia Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation [now the WWE], Jim Crockett Promotions, Mid-South Wrestling and finally, the Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling) until 2001, NCAA college football games (from 1981 to 1992 and from 2002 to 2007 season), various NASCAR auto races and the Olympics-inspired Goodwill Games. The WGN national feed also was prohibited from carrying Chicago Blackhawks hockey games, when WGN-TV assumed local rights to the team during the 2007–08 season, due to broadcast rights restrictions imposed by the NHL to protect the league&#x27;s exclusive national broadcasting contracts with ESPN and later a joint broadcast-cable contract with NBCUniversal.

===Evolution and decline; the remaining superstations===
Even though superstations remained reasonably popular among cable and satellite subscribers, in no small part because of team-based sports broadcasts, various changes to the television industry beginning in the 1990s—especially the proliferation of cable-originated program services and the resultant increase in original programming produced by many cable channels—as well as existing distant signal policies—such as the syndication exclusivity rules—precipitated the decline in their viability. As early as 1986, with the launch of the Fox Broadcasting Company, a handful of the intrastate superstations – such as KMSP-TV (channel 9, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in Minneapolis–St. Paul, KSHB-TV (channel 41, now an NBC affiliate) in Kansas City and WKBD-TV (channel 50, now a CW affiliate) in Detroit—that continued to maintain reasonable out-of-market distribution after the March 1983 copyright royalty increase had terminated their carriage agreements with cable providers beyond their home markets because of the presence of local independent stations that were able to serve as prospective Fox affiliates in many of the areas within the imported stations&#x27; remaining distribution footprint. Additional decline in the availability of intrastate superstations came in the mid-1990s, when many of the remaining regional superstations let their carriage agreements expire or terminated them outright amid local network affiliation shuffles that caused stations such as KTVT, KSTW and KPHO-TV (channel 5, now a CBS affiliate) in Phoenix taking on affiliations with one of the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS or NBC), as contractual and federal restrictions prevented them from maintaining regional distribution upon becoming major network affiliates.

Very few of these stations reduced their distribution as a result of taking affiliations with either the United Paramount Network (UPN) or The WB Television Network. In fact, in December 1993, Time Warner permitted Tribune Broadcasting and United Video to have WGN-TV—which initially had intended to maintain a limited, if any, relationship with the network—act as a de facto national feed for The WB to cover smaller and mid-sized markets where extra time was needed for the network to fill absences in local affiliate coverage. (The Tribune Company held minority ownership in The WB from August 1995 until the founding of successor The CW in January 2006, when the company relinquished its interest to avoid partially shouldering The WB&#x27;s shutdown expenses.) Station management had expressed concerns over the potential negative impacts fulfilling commitments to the network&#x27;s soon-to-be-expanded program offerings would have on its sports broadcast rights and, by association, its national distribution; Time Warner rectified those issues by agreeing to reduce the network&#x27;s initial schedule to one night per week (from two) in exchange for leasing airtime on the WGN national feed. WGN carried the full WB programming schedule—including the Kids&#x27; WB children&#x27;s program block, which was not carried by the WGN Chicago signal until 2004—nationwide from the network&#x27;s January 1995 launch until October 1999, when carriage of the network (outside Chicago) was discontinued upon mutual agreement between Time Warner and Tribune/United Video to limit programming conflicts with The WB&#x27;s initial charter affiliates and other local broadcast and cable-only affiliates that joined the network over the previous four years. In direct contrast, WWOR (owned at the time by network parent Chris-Craft/United Television) restricted availability of UPN programming to its New York-area signal, believed to be the result of a network non-duplication claim filed by non-equity network partner Paramount Television that prohibited Eastern Microwave from using the WWOR EMI Service as a national UPN feed. The downside of the Paramount decision was that, from January 1995 until over-the-air digital multicasting became viable in the first half of the 2000s, it left most or all UPN programming unavailable in some mid-sized and most smaller markets where the network was not able, at least initially, to gain even secondary affiliate clearances.

WWOR—although it technically never gave up its superstation status—ceased distributing a national cable feed on December 31, 1996, a move made by Advance Entertainment Corporation (which assumed ownership of corporate cousin Eastern Microwave Inc. and its satellite distribution rights to WWOR and WSBK-TV earlier in 1996) to avoid having to pay an increased royalty fee for the first six months of 1997 that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal instituted on January 1, 1997. To the consternation of many cable systems because of how it marketed the action, weeks before the WWOR EMI Service was to be discontinued, Discovery Networks quickly purchased the feed&#x27;s satellite transponder slot from Advance Entertainment to expand distribution of the fledgling Animal Planet network. About 12.5 million cable subscribers (most of which resided east of the Mississippi River) lost access to WWOR&#x27;s programming as a consequence. Amid outcry from satellite dish owners, less than one week after the EMI Service feed was discontinued, the National Programming Service, LLC (NPS) subsidiary of carrier firm All American Direct uplinked the station&#x27;s New York-area broadcast feed on a separate satellite transponder for exclusive distribution by satellite providers; since syndication exclusivity rules did not apply to home dish providers at the time, the NPS-delivered feed featured all syndicated and UPN network programs that could be seen by viewers in the New York City market. (Because of this, select cable providers picked up the NPS feed to serve as a default UPN programming source in markets where no local UPN affiliate existed, either due to the lack of a standalone fifth or sixth secular commercial station for an exclusive affiliation – particularly through the loss of affiliate clearances to The WB, as was the case in certain markets affected by that network&#x27;s 1997 agreement with the Sinclair Broadcast Group – or the lack of a secondary clearance with an existing commercial network station.) The NPS-delivered feed was discontinued in 1999 to repurpose the transponder to distribute the national feed of Pax TV (now Ion Television), though Dish Network continues to distribute WWOR nationwide , primarily in areas that do not have a local MyNetworkTV affiliate.

TBS, the national version of WTBS, evolved into a hybrid superstation on January 1, 1998. Upon undertaking the operational conventions of a traditional basic cable service, the national channel—which, following a series of name alterations between 1987 and 1996, was known at the time as TBS Superstation—began to collect subscriber fees and, as it was now effectively exempt from the 1976 Copyright Act&#x27;s signal modification restrictions, began offering systems the ability to lease advertising time to participating providers for the sale and insertion of local commercials. The TBS cable channel, however, retained the WTBS signal as its originating feed and continued to simulcast almost all of the programming seen in the Atlanta market (except for Atlanta-targeted advertisements, and customary weekend morning blocks of public affairs and syndicated educational programs intended to fulfill FCC public service and Children&#x27;s Television Act requirements that were shown exclusively on WTBS). As a byproduct of a national broadcast deal reached between Turner/Time Warner and Major League Baseball that granted TBS rights to carry regular season and postseason games involving various MLB teams (ending its team-specific focus on games involving the Atlanta Braves that traced before it achieved national distribution), TBS eventually gave up its superstation status altogether on October 1, 2007, when the TBS cable channel and WTBS formally separated their programming schedules and branding. The former Atlanta broadcast feed concurrently changed its call letters to WPCH-TV (rebranding as &quot;Peachtree TV&quot;) and began targeting its programming exclusively toward its home market, limiting its distribution within North America (outside the Atlanta market) to Canadian television providers that were already receiving the station prior to the TBS split.

The separation of TBS from its founding Atlanta parent left the WGN national feed – which became known as Superstation WGN in November 2002 and then as WGN America in May 2008 – as the last remaining superstation to be transmitted nationwide through all multichannel television distribution methods, whereas the other six remaining superstations are available only through satellite television. Into the 2000s, WGN America increasingly relied less on WGN-TV program simulcasts as fewer syndicated programs seen on the Chicago feed were able to be given national &quot;full-signal&quot; clearances, opting to plug holes in the schedule with more &quot;SyndEx-proof&quot; syndicated programs. (Programming shared between the national and local WGN feeds in later years consisted of a limited number of syndicated programs and selected feature films; most Chicago Cubs and White Sox baseball and select Bulls basketball games; select local news and public affairs programs; and certain local and syndicated specials.) The channel also chose not to carry newscasts and Chicago-originated lifestyle and entertainment programs that WGN-TV added to its schedule as the station began to better emphasize news and other locally produced content starting in 2008. Following the Tribune Company&#x27;s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid a debt-laden 2007 leveraged buyout by real estate investor Sam Zell and subsequent takeover by three private equity firms (Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co.), Tribune unveiled plans to turn WGN America into a conventional basic cable network incorporating original programming content, to increase the channel&#x27;s visibility and stave off potential defections from television providers because of the expense of paying increasing copyright fees to transmit programs now readily available elsewhere. (Through this conversion, WGN America began phasing out all local news and sports programming simulcast with the Chicago signal, concluding with the removal of its morning and midday newscasts from WGN America&#x27;s lineup on December 15, 2014.) WGN&#x27;s superstation status ended (in the United States) on December 16, 2014, when all remaining simulcasts of the Chicago station&#x27;s local news, public affairs and sports programming were removed from its schedule and the first carriage agreements that shifted WGN America from limited to expanded basic tiers (involving Comcast Xfinity systems in Chicago and four other major markets) went into effect. WGN-TV would eventually be made available throughout the United States once again in the spring of 2015, when antenna manufacturer Channel Master included the Chicago-area feed among the initial offerings on its short-lived over-the-top streaming service LinearTV.

The five remaining &quot;true&quot; superstations—WPIX, KTLA, KWGN-TV, WWOR-TV and WSBK-TV—are carried on some rural cable providers and via satellite through Dish Network and C-Band systems. Since the 1988 syndication exclusivity rules were implemented, WKAQ-TV (channel 2) in San Juan and WAPA-TV (channel 4) in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico have been the only American television stations to achieve superstation status, although neither fits the legal criteria of a superstation as defined by the FCC. WKAQ&#x27;s signal became available in the mainland United States in 2001, when Telemundo Group converted its Telemundo Internacional cable channel—which began as a cable news channel under the name Telenoticias in 1994—into a national feed of the station, branded as Telemundo Puerto Rico; the feed is available in the contiguous United States through select cable providers and via satellite on Dish Network and DirecTV. LIN Television Corp. began distributing a direct-to-satellite national feed of WAPA-TV, WAPA America, on September 1, 2004, through DirecTV&#x27;s Para Todos Spanish-language tier; WAPA America is also available through select cable providers and on Dish Network. (Unlike the five superstations licensed within the U.S. mainland, WAPA&#x27;s programming is generally &quot;SyndEx-proof&quot; as its schedule consists of domestically produced programs and acquired programming not widely available on broadcasters elsewhere within the Continental United States.) Since its inception in 1994, Dish Network has offered an a la carte tier of all five aforementioned mainland superstations to subscribers outside of the stations&#x27; respective home markets. The tier continued to be sold for many years following the 1999 passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, despite concerns expressed by representatives for former Dish parent EchoStar that prevalent program blackouts caused by requests from local broadcast licensees made under SHVIA syndication exclusivity and sports blackout provisions could force it to drop the five mainland superstations from its lineup. Indeed, such requests have led Dish Network to stop offering one or more of the stations in some markets in recent years, culminating in Dish ceasing all future sales of the superstation tier on September 19, 2013. (A grandfathering waiver exists for subscribers who purchased the tier prior to the cut-off date, allowing them to continue receiving the superstation package barring they ever cancel their subscription to the tier or to Dish Network.)

==Canada==
Canada does not have any television stations that operate as &quot;superstations&quot; in the traditional construct of the term. Technically, virtually every Canadian terrestrial television station is a superstation, as almost every local television station in that country – most commonly those that are owned-and-operated stations, as well as a few affiliates, of the five national English-language networks (CBC Television; the CTV Television Network and its companion system, CTV 2; Citytv; and the Global Television Network), and the three French language networks (Ici Radio-Canada Télé, Noovo, and TVA) – are carried nationally by one or both of the country&#x27;s satellite providers, Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct, and any of these stations can be carried by any Canadian cable provider at minimum on a digital cable programming tier. The closest Canadian equivalents to the &quot;superstation&quot; model are the television system, to some extent (basically acting as a smaller, less-centralized form of the network model), and, moreso, the independent station (the number of which had grown to some extent with the 2009 demise of E!—a sister system to Global that was originally known as CH from its founding in 2001 until 2007—although some have become affiliates of other networks and systems).

Beginning in the late 1980s, Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom, now Shaw Broadcast Services) began distributing the signals of independents CHAN-TV (channel 8, now a Global owned-and-operated station) in Vancouver, British Columbia, CITV-TV (channel 13, now a Global owned-and-operated station) in Edmonton, Alberta, and CHCH-TV (channel 11) in Hamilton, Ontario, primarily for distribution by cable systems in smaller markets throughout Canada. Coincidentally, these stations were, like Cancom, either owned or later acquired by Western International Communications (WIC). As a result of their early availability, which predated the existence of most Canadian specialty channels, these stations – the former two of which are now owned by Corus Entertainment and the latter by Channel Zero – continue to maintain a superstation-type status on analog cable in many smaller Canadian communities as well as on border-area cable systems in the United States (such as Buffalo–Niagara Falls, New York, Burlington, Vermont, and Bellingham, Washington).

Presently, both the aforementioned CHCH and CJON-DT (channel 21) in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador use slogans referring to each as a &quot;superstation&quot;, though neither station has any special regulatory status at present conferring that title. Neither CHCH nor CJON holds a formal network affiliation, although the latter (which identifies under the &quot;NTV&quot; brand) carries news and entertainment programming from Global and news programming from CTV, and both stations carry programming from the country&#x27;s only syndicator, the religious and secular family service yes TV. (CJON and CHCH are both notable for streaming their programming feeds to viewers in a superstation-type manner within and outside of Canada through their websites; yes TV and CBC Television also maintain free online live streams but restrict access to viewers with Canadian IP addresses. In both cases, only a limited amount of non-local programming is carried on the online feed.)

Moreover, multichannel television providers within Canada are able to distribute American television stations in their digital package, regardless of whether they are superstations or affiliates of the five major U.S. broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox or The CW) that are authorized by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which maintains a list of foreign television channels approved for distribution by the agency. The CRTC authorizes five of the six designated American superstations (sans WAPA America) for carriage on domestic multichannel television providers. Under CRTC rules first implemented on October 26, 1983, to bolster domestic programming services (particularly both independently-owned and specialty services) by requiring providers to &quot;link&quot; U.S.-based services in discretionary tiers tied to Canadian services, all authorized American superstations typically are received mainly through a subscription to one or more domestic premium channels (such as Crave, Starz, Super Channel and/or Super Écran, and previously the now-defunct services Movie Central and Encore Avenue). Superstations included in Section &quot;B&quot; of the CRTC&#x27;s Part II eligible services list are mandated to be packaged with premium services; however, under a related rule that allows for one superstation of the provider&#x27;s choice to be carried on a non-premium tier, some television providers have chosen to offer either TBS/WPCH-TV, WGN-TV or WSBK in a specialty tier.

On April 4, 1985, the CRTC granted authorization for WTBS, WGN-TV, WPIX and WOR-TV to be distributed to cable providers within Canada under Section &quot;B&quot; of the Part II eligible services list. Three other superstations were given clearance by the CRTC under the Part II Section &quot;B&quot; list during the 1990s: WSBK-TV was granted authorization on April 29, 1991 (per a request by First Choice Canadian Communications Corporation, then-owner of premium service First Choice [now Crave]), KTLA was granted authorization on July 17, 1991, and KWGN was granted authorization on July 22, 1997. KTLA and KWGN were each placed under the Part III non-Canadian services list simultaneous with their placement on the Part II list. (, KWGN-TV is the only one of the seven CRTC-approved superstations that has no cable or satellite availability within Canada.)

TBS was removed from the Canadian market when it became a cable-exclusive channel in the U.S. in October 2007, as the CRTC had only given approval for its former parent Atlanta broadcast signal to be carried by cable, satellite and other multichannel television providers within the country; for this reason, Canadian viewers instead receive the rechristened WPCH-TV. (WPCH is one of only two superstations eligible under the Commission&#x27;s foreign distribution list, along with WGN-TV as a result of its programming separation from its WGN America companion service in December 2014, that is no longer distributed in the United States as a regional or national superstation.) Similarly, on January 17, 2007, common carrier firm Shaw Broadcast Services ceased distribution of the WGN national feed in favor of offering the station&#x27;s Chicago signal, a decision believed to have resulted from increased licensing fees for the then-superstation feed. (Some providers, including MTS TV and Cogeco Cable, continued to carry the superstation feed afterward in place of or in conjunction with the Chicago signal.)

==Mexico==
Much as is the case in Canada, almost all of the commercial and non-commercial television stations in Mexico are available on satellite to be carried on cable and other direct-to-home (DTH) television providers within the country. However, no station had equal transmission nationwide: certain laws, such as the electoral law, forbid television stations from broadcasting advertisements (particularly, political campaign ads) originating from other states or regions within the country. The country&#x27;s telecommunications agency, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), also mandates that direct-broadcast satellite providers carry the signals of stations that are part of television networks that cover 50% of the Mexican territory, albeit with regional lockouts for advertisements.

==Radio superstations==
The first radio station in North America to achieve superstation distribution via satellite was Chicago&#x27;s WFMT (98.7 FM), a classical music station that was uplinked by United Video to the Satcom I satellite in May 1979, which began distributing its signal via satellite as a cable radio feed throughout the United States and was also distributed in over two dozen countries overseas (including the Soviet Union and China). Like with fellow United Video-distributed superstation WGN-TV in that same market during its early years as a cable superstation, other than some limited revenue from a scant number of national advertisers, WFMT earned no extra revenue from its expanded distribution. (Incidentally, WFMT was co-owned with WGN-TV from 1968 until 1970, when WGN Continental Broadcasting donated the WFMT assets to the Chicagoland Educational Television Association, owner of local PBS station WTTW [channel 11].) WSM (650 AM) in Nashville, Tennessee, also received a lot of attention in the 1980s through its distribution via C-band alongside The Nashville Network (which was co-owned with WSM radio at the time through Gaylord Entertainment). Very few stations actually distribute themselves through C-band, as the station&#x27;s audio can now more easily be dialed in through either ISDN lines, or listened to via an audio stream over the internet (if the station offers such a service). Radio stations that relay their audio feed via C-band, like WEEI-FM (93.7) in Boston, often do so to feed the signal to others that simulcast the programming throughout the New England region. This is the case with several stations in Mexico, as radio and television broadcasting in that country is very nationalized and most local stations merely act as 24-hour-a-day affiliates of a national network.

Some local radio stations are, or have been distributed on satellite radio throughout the United States, and Canada in select cases. Stations that have previously maintained distribution over satellite radio have included WLTW (106.7 FM) in New York City, KHMX (96.5 FM) in Houston, KIIS-FM (102.7) in Los Angeles, KNEW (960 AM) in San Francisco, WTKS-FM (104.1) in Orlando, WLW (700 AM) in Cincinnati and WSIX-FM (97.9 FM) in Nashville on XM Satellite Radio, and WSM on Sirius Satellite Radio. XM, in particular, used radio-based superstations owned by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) for much of its channel lineup during the early years of the provider&#x27;s existence; the two Clear Channel radio superstations that remained on its lineup – WLW and WSIX – were dropped by XM Satellite Radio in March 2009. The signals of WSIX, KIIS and WLTW returned to the now-merged Sirius XM lineup in June 2011, along with two new additions, CHR station WHTZ (100.3 FM) in New York City and urban contemporary outlet WGCI-FM (107.5) in Chicago. All iHeartMedia stations have since been removed from Sirius XM as a byproduct of the launch and growth of co-owned streaming radio platform iHeartRadio; WGCI, WLTW, and WSIX were removed in 2013 after Clear Channel sold its stake in Sirius XM, WHTZ left the satellite service in June 2020 with a stream continuing on Sirius XM&#x27;s online service, and KIIS was removed in June 2022, along with the Sirius XM-hosted WHTZ simulcast.

Three other specialty format stations—WBBR (1130 AM) in New York City, the flagship affiliate of the Bloomberg Radio business news service; WCSP-FM (90.1) in Washington, D.C., the sole affiliate of C-SPAN Radio; and KBYR-HD2 (89.1 FM HD2) in Provo, Utah, part of Brigham Young University&#x27;s BYU Radio service—are currently distributed on satellite radio, the former two of which are in lieu of their parent services maintaining conventional full-time affiliations with other radio properties across the United States. Most of WBBR&#x27;s programming is also syndicated terrestrially to other stations through United Stations Radio Networks. (KPIG-FM [107.5] in Santa Cruz, California ended its terrestrial syndication deal with Dial Global in March 2010, becoming one of the few radio stations to place its audio stream behind a paywall; this made WBBR the only terrestrial superstation on U.S. radio.) KDIS (1110 AM, now KWVE) in Pasadena, California (serving the Los Angeles market) converted to superstation status in 2014, a byproduct of Radio Disney – for which it serves as the children&#x27;s radio network&#x27;s flagship outlet, and became its only analog terrestrial broadcaster as a result – refocusing its efforts primarily on mobile distribution after drawing down its remaining affiliates through both the sales or shutdowns of its owned-and-operated stations and the format conversions of terrestrial affiliates not owned by The Walt Disney Company. (Radio Disney began to reinstate conventional terrestrial radio coverage in 2016 through brokered arrangements over HD Radio subchannels, albeit with a drastically reduced affiliate base than it had up until the early 2010s.)

Prior to CBS Corporation&#x27;s 2017 sale of its radio properties to Entercom, in 2011, CBS Radio began using HD Radio technology to relay the signals of its major-market music-formatted stations to other markets around the country. For instance, KFRG (95.1 FM) in San Bernardino is carried on KTWV-HD3 (94.7 FM HD3) in Los Angeles, KSCF (103.7 FM, now KSON) in San Diego is heard on KAMP-HD2 (97.1 FM HD2) in Los Angeles; WBZ-FM (98.5 FM) in Boston was heard on WTIC-HD3 (96.5 FM HD3) in Hartford up until after Entercom sold WBZ-FM to the Beasley Broadcast Group in November 2017; KROQ-FM (106.7) in Los Angeles was formerly heard on KEGY (97.3 FM, now KWFN) in San Diego; and both WXRK-HD2 (92.3 FM HD2, now WINS-FM), and WFAN (660 AM) in New York City are respectively simulcast on three affiliates – WOCL-HD3 (105.9 FM HD3) in Orlando, WLLD-HD3 (94.1 FM HD3) in Tampa, and WEAT-HD3 (107.9 FM HD3) in West Palm Beach – in Florida.

In many cases where radio stations distribute outside their home market, the local stations make some concessions, such as replacement of local advertisements with either national advertising or a bed of production music that plays over commercial breaks. Also in the example of WFAN, that station&#x27;s play-by-play coverage of the New York Mets and Giants, the New Jersey Devils and the Brooklyn Nets is not carried on the Florida HD Radio affiliates and replaced with alternate programming, as the station only has rights to transmit the game broadcasts in the New York metropolitan area.

<doc id="1261315" wikidata="Q7796366" url="?curid=1261315" title="Thorndon, New Zealand">
<text>Thorndon is a historic inner suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. Because the suburb is relatively level compared to the hilly terrain elsewhere in Wellington it contained Wellington&#x27;s elite residential area until it changed in the 1960s with the building of a new motorway and the erection of tall office buildings on the sites of its Molesworth Street retail and service businesses.

Before Thorndon was Thorndon it was Haukawakawa and in 1824 Pipitea Pā was settled at its southern end. More recently Pipitea Marae and the land under the Government Centre have been separated from Thorndon and the name Pipitea returned in 2003. The reclamations have been included in the new suburb Pipitea.

Thorndon combines the home of government and residential accommodation. It is located at the northern end of the Central Business District.

==History==

Pipitea has been said to have been named for the pipi beds along Thorndon Quay.

Ngāti Mutunga from Taranaki established the fortified village, Pipitea Pā, in 1824 on the Haukawakawa flats. Then the Ngāti Mutunga left on the sailing ship Rodney in 1835 settling in the Chatham Islands and Te Āti Awa occupied the pā. The pā declined after European settlement though some people remained there into the 20th century. There were other villages near 191 Thorndon Quay and near the junction of Hobson Street with Fitzherbert Terrace. The Pā&#x27;s gardens reached parliament grounds and the Botanic Garden. A mural &quot;Kaiota&quot; was painted in 2023 on Bowen Street referencing Māori cultivations of the area of the homesteads Pakuo Pā and Raurimu Kainga.

Part of the previous pā site opened in 1980 as an urban marae. The site transferred to Te Āti Awa/Taranaki whānui as part of the local Treaty Settlement in 2009.

Pipitea Marae and its meeting house, Te Upoko o te Ika a Māui, is a meeting place for Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o te Ika and Te Āti Awa.

Thorndon, like Te Aro, is one of the few comparatively flat areas on the harbour. Haukawakawa / Thorndon flats became a significant part of Port Nicholson&#x27;s first organised European settlement in 1840. S C Brees described it in 1848 as &quot;the court end of town&quot;. European settlers built their houses alongside the Maori settlement of Pipitea and the New Zealand Company named all the flats Thorndon after the estate of W H F Petre one of their directors.

==Notable buildings==
The buildings of the New Zealand Parliament are located in Thorndon. Thorndon is also the location of national institutions including the Appeal and High Courts —the Supreme Court is on Lambton Quay facing Parliament— the National Library and Archives New Zealand.
The national museum moved from behind Parliament in Museum Street to a much larger purpose-built building in Buckle Street just before the second world war then in 1998 to the harbour edge and is now Te Papa Tongarewa.

Thorndon is home to two Cathedrals: the Anglican St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral built between 1937 and 1998 to replace the pro-cathedral now known as Old St Paul&#x27;s, which in turn had replaced a church on the site of the Beehive in 1844; and the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Cathedral in Hill Street, opened in 1901 to replace the destroyed St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Eccleston Hill dating from 1851.

The Thistle Inn is one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest pubs.

==Geographic boundaries==
Thorndon occupies the northern end of the narrow coastal plain that makes up the heart of Wellington. It is flanked to the north by the green hills of Wadestown, by Northland and Kelburn to the west and south, and on its south Pipitea with the Government Centre, the marae and to its east the port facilities of Wellington Harbour. Thorndon now incorporates Te Ahumairangi Hill.

The boundaries of Thorndon form a very rough triangle. Starting from the triangle&#x27;s lower south-west corner, at the intersection of Glenmore Street and Collins Terrace, the boundary goes up through the north side of Te Ahumairangi Hill right across to Wadestown&#x27;s Weld Street and down to the north end of Frandi Street. Then the boundary follows the west side of Thorndon Quay down until Davis Street where it zig-zags through to Hill Street then over to Bowen Street, Tinakori Road and Glenmore Street up to its junction with Collins Terrace.

==Parks and gardens==
Queen&#x27;s Park was created to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. It is bounded by Grant Road, Wadestown Road and Park Road with a fountain at the intersection of Grant Road and Wadestown Road. Trees in the park are a mixture of natives and exotics including a stand of oak trees. The Magyar Millennium Park, commonly known as the Hungarian garden, is on the corner of Molesworth Street and Hawkestone Street. It was built in 2003, although it was planned to be opened in 2000 to mark the millennium of Hungary being a Christian state. It is the only Hungarian monument in New Zealand. It incorporates a paved area, seating, planted garden beds, a carved gate and memorial plaques. The Katherine Mansfield Memorial Park in Fitzherbert Terrace is dedicated to the writer Katherine Mansfield. It was created in the late 1960s when the urban motorway was built and incorporates the Lady McKenzie Garden for the Blind. The Wellington Botanic Garden is situated between the suburbs of Thorndon and Kelburn.

===Thorndon Esplanade===

&quot;Wellington&#x27;s Show Walk&quot;. Thorndon Esplanade with its baths and shrubs lies beneath Aotea Quay. Its band rotunda was sent to Central Park in 1921. Built at the end of the 1880s on the reclamation of the Manawatu Railway Company and intended to be a place of fashionable display it did not survive the first World War. It had become dirty and disreputable suffering from the increased activity in the smoky railway yards alongside. Its coprosmas and &quot;gallant pohutukawas&quot; never grew larger seeming to lack any care from the City Council but the wind and the poor soil and the grimy railway yard discouraged plants and visitors. &quot;Lovers seemed to monopolise the gardens in the evenings&quot;.

The salt water baths were closed in 1920 and the superstructure moved to Evans Bay for dressing sheds. New baths opened in Murphy Street in November 1924 with certain hours set aside for mixed bathing.

<doc id="1261317" wikidata="Q5081481" url="?curid=1261317" title="Charles Panici">
<text>Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Panici (December 26, 1930 - December 20, 2017 ) was mayor of Chicago Heights, Illinois from 1975 to 1991. He was also head of the Bloom Township Republican Party from 1978 to 1992. He was born in 1930 in the &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; section of Chicago Heights, a south suburb, which was the home to mainly Italian immigrants in a heavily Italian town. His parents operated &quot;Three Star Restaurant&quot;, a popular hangout for many neighborhood residents.

== Political career ==
Panici began his political career in the early 1970s as President of the Chicago Heights Park District. In 1975, he put together a coalition ticket and easily defeated the incumbent mayor. His Concerned Citizens ticket won three of the four seats on the city council. In 1979, Panici won again, with his entire city council slate of John Gliottoni, Louise Marshall and Eugene Sadus winning re-election. They were joined by Nicholas C. &quot;Nick&quot; LoBue, and all five won easy victories in 1983 and 1987. His administration was responsible for bringing Lake Michigan water to Chicago Heights after residents had complained for years about poor water quality. Several municipal buildings were also built during his tenure, including a new City Hall, police station and library.

Beginning in 1978, Panici was the Bloom Township Republican Committeeman. With a patronage army that spanned all levels of city and township government. During Panici&#x27;s time as Bloom Township&#x27;s Republican leader, it consistently turned out one of the highest Republican vote totals in the Chicago suburbs. This made the Bloom GOP one of the most powerful political organizations in Illinois. The party backed winning candidates in every city, park district, school district and township race during the 1980s.

Panici was also responsible for fostering the political careers of numerous local officials, state legislators and judges during that time. He was instrumental in the campaigns of Governor Jim Thompson. The party became so powerful that Bloom Township High School hosted President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush in 1988. Panici even forged alliances with Democrats, and was partly responsible for bringing former Cook County Democratic chairman Edward Vrdolyak to the county&#x27;s Republican party. Panici also organized a crossover vote in 1992 to defeat former congressman Gus Savage in the Democratic primary.

Panici co-founded Telecommunication Services (TCS) with two other Chicago Heights entrepreneurs, and the company grew rapidly during the 1980s and early 1990s, serving many of the area&#x27;s hospitals and other businesses.

== FBI investigation ==
In 1988, south suburban mob boss Albert Tocco of Chicago Heights was indicted for a wide range of crimes, including racketeering, murder, extortion, and arson. He was also implicated by his wife in the murder of Anthony Spilotro, which was depicted in the movie &quot;Casino&quot;. Although he was never charged with the Spilotro killing, he would be convicted on many other charges in 1990 and sentenced to 200 years in prison. During the trial, LoBue&#x27;s name was mentioned along with another Panici ally, former South Chicago Heights mayor Donald Prisco. Testimony alleged that LoBue and Prisco were accepting bribe money from Tocco in exchange for their help in keeping the garbage-hauling license for both cities in the hands of Tocco&#x27;s Chicago Heights Disposal. This led federal investigators to open a wide-ranging probe of public corruption in Chicago Heights. In 1990, Chicago Heights Street Department superintendent Ernest Molyneaux pleaded guilty to accepting payoffs from Tocco and another city contractor and cooperated with the investigation, leading to the indictments of LoBue and Prisco later that year. The two were charged with multiple racketeering violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The investigation also led to the indictments of several other city officials on charges of bribery, tax evasion and other crimes. Under this cloud of controversy, Panici chose not to seek re-election as mayor in 1991. His hand-picked successor, Douglas Troiani, won an easy victory against Sadus, who had split with the party.

In March 1992, two weeks after the death of his wife, Panici was indicted along with Gliottoni and Marshall on federal charges of racketeering, extortion and bribery. He was also charged separately with witness tampering for directing a witness to lie to investigators. The indictment charged that the group extorted more than $700,000 from businesses in return for city contracts. Panici stepped down from his post as township Republican committeeman after the indictment.

LoBue and Prisco each pleaded guilty to lesser crimes and agreed to testify against the others. LoBue would tell a federal jury that nearly every major city contractor paid kickbacks to city council members and other public officials. LoBue testified that Panici decided how much bribe money would be required to secure each contract, and who would receive the payoffs. One of these schemes involved monthly payments from Tocco to LoBue and Panici. Prisco and lifelong Panici friend Ralph Galderio, a former city employee, also testified that Panici was involved in bribery and received significantly reduced sentences in return for their testimony. Panici was accused of personally taking nearly $260,000 in bribes during his 16 years as mayor.

Panici, Gliottoni and Marshall were convicted in 1993 on all charges. Panici was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Gliottoni to five years, six months and Marshall to four years. Over the next several years, other Panici allies would also head to prison. Bloom Township Supervisor Robert Grossi was sentenced to four years in prison in 1996 for misusing township funds, and former Chicago Heights Deputy Police Chief Sam Mangialardi would get a 10½ year sentence for his 1995 conviction on charges that he accepted $10,000 monthly payments to protect the city&#x27;s top drug dealer. Panici was not involved in either case.

== After the fall ==
Panici was released in 2001, and returned to live in Chicago Heights. He has always maintained that LoBue, who admittedly had ties to organized crime, extorted city contractors without Panici&#x27;s approval or knowledge. He published a book, &quot;From Hero to Zero: How the Feds and a Mafia Wannabe Took a Good Man Down&quot; in 2013 detailing his version of the events leading up to his trial and imprisonment In his later years, he remained active in local politics, advising several candidates successfully. Panici died in Chicago Heights on December 20, 2017 after a lengthy illness.

<text>The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated is an American restaurant company and distributor of cheesecakes based in the United States. It operates 348 full-service restaurants: 215 under the Cheesecake Factory brand, 42 under the North Italia brand, and 91 under other brands. The Cheesecake Factory also operates two bakery production facilities—in Calabasas, California, and Rocky Mount, North Carolina—and licenses two bakery-based menus for other foodservice operators under the Cheesecake Factory Bakery Cafe marque. Its cheesecakes and other baked goods can also be found in the cafes of many Barnes &amp; Noble stores.

David M. Overton, the company&#x27;s founder, opened the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, in 1978. The restaurant established the future chain&#x27;s pattern of featuring an eclectic menu, large portions, and signature cheesecakes. In 2020, &quot;Fortune&quot; ranked the Cheesecake Factory at number 12 on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction. Additionally, The Cheesecake Factory’s average unit volume consistently leads the casual restaurant industry.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
Evelyn Overton, inspired by a cheesecake recipe from a Detroit newspaper, made a cheesecake for her husband&#x27;s employer in the 1940s. The cheesecake was well-received, and subsequently led her to open a small cheesecake bakery in Detroit, Michigan, in the late 1950s. She closed the bakery to raise her children, but continued supplying cheesecakes to local restaurants from her basement kitchen. In 1967, Evelyn&#x27;s son David M. Overton left Detroit to attend Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, but in 1968, decided to be a drummer, performing with the &quot;Billy Roberts Blues Band&quot;. In 1971, David convinced his parents to relocate to Los Angeles to open a commercial bakery. In 1972, they moved to the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles where they opened the Cheesecake Factory Bakery, in which they produced cheesecakes and other desserts for local restaurants.

===California===
In 1978, Evelyn&#x27;s son David opened the Cheesecake Factory, a small salad-and-sandwich restaurant in Beverly Hills that sold ten varieties of cheesecakes on a one-page menu. In 1983, he opened a second restaurant in Marina del Rey. By 1987, the Beverly Hills location had expanded into a 78-seat restaurant and was experiencing great financial success. This led to the opening of a third, larger location in Redondo Beach, which was eventually renovated into a 300-seat, location. By the end of the 1980s, the Cheesecake Factory&#x27;s one-page menu had expanded, and the restaurant offered additional fast-food and short-order items.

===Expansion beyond Southern California===
The 1990s saw the opening of the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant outside of Southern California. The new restaurant was located in Washington, D.C. The Cheesecake Factory was incorporated in 1992 and went public in September 1993. David Overton planned to open 3–4 units a year to generate a 25% yearly increase in sales.

The company began changing its menu twice a year and adding steaks, seafood, and vegetarian dishes. The company continued to open new restaurants and by 1995 was ranked 11th in the United States. As of April 2013, the Cheesecake Factory operated 162 restaurants under the Cheesecake Factory name in 36 states. Plaza Las Américas in San Juan, Puerto Rico, opened its first Cheesecake Factory on August 28, 2013.

The company used to operate one self-service, limited-menu express food service operation under the Cheesecake Factory marque inside DisneyQuest at Disney Springs in Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. It opened in 1998 and closed in 2017.

===International expansion===
The Cheesecake Factory has expanded into international markets by licensing agreements for other companies to operate franchises and corporate ownership. The first store outside the United States was opened at The Dubai Mall in August 2012 as a franchise via a licensing agreement.On January 25, 2011, the company expanded into the Middle East in a partnership with Kuwaiti retail franchising company M.H. Alshaya Co. The 300-seat restaurant opened on August 16, 2012, at The Dubai Mall. This is the Cheesecake Factory&#x27;s first location outside the United States.

In May 2014, the Cheesecake Factory announced that it would open the first Cheesecake Factory in East Asia. The first East Asian Cheesecake Factory opened in Disneytown in Pudong, Shanghai, China, on June 16, 2016.

Also, in 2014, the first Cheesecake Factory in Mexico opened its doors in Guadalajara.

As of May 2018, the Cheesecake Factory has eleven restaurants in the Middle East: four in Dubai (Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, Jumeirah Beach Residence and Dubai Festival City Mall), three in Kuwait (Arabella, Sidra, and The Avenues—which was the 160th Cheesecake Factory opening), two in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh and Jeddah), and lastly one in the Yas Mall and one in The Galleria in Abu Dhabi. On December 1, 2015, the Cheesecake Factory opened its eighth Middle East branch at the Verdun Shopping Center in Beirut, Lebanon. Many of the Cheesecake Factory management attended the opening, including managers from the US and Dubai. The Cheesecake Factory also made its first appearance in Doha, Qatar, by opening in the Mall of Qatar and further opened two more branches in Villaggio and Doha Festival City.

There are Cheesecake Factories in Parque Delta and Centro Santa Fe, Mexico City.

On April 12, 2017, the company announced it would expand into Canada. In November 2017, the first Canadian location opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.

In May 2017, a Hong Kong store opened in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui.

As of the end of 2021, the Cheesecake Factory is open for business in Canada, USA, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Mexico, the Chinese Mainland, and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

==Legal problems==
On December 4, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission resolved charges brought against the Cheesecake Factory for misleading investors during the COVID-19 pandemic; the company paid a $125,000 fine without admitting the findings in the order.

==Other restaurants==
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery Cafe operates two bakery production facilities in Calabasas Hills, California, and Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and licenses two bakery-based menus to other food service operators. This division operates in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The Cheesecake Factory Bakery has appointed Schengen Desserts B.V. as their master distributor for Europe.

===Grand Lux Cafe===

David Overton designed the Grand Lux Cafe, an upscale restaurant for The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. The restaurant is modeled after Italian, French, and Austrian styles. The Cafe offers, in addition to American and European-style food, Thai, Malaysian, Caribbean cuisine, and others. The Cheesecake Factory operates seven Grand Lux Cafe restaurants located in Florida, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. A location in Chicago closed December 24, 2023.

Each Grand Lux Cafe features an on-site bakery that produces a selection of signature bake-to-order desserts (up to 30 minutes) and a full-service craft bar.

===RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen===
RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen was a contemporary Asian-fusion restaurant that opened on June 19, 2008, at Century City in Los Angeles. David Overton excluded Chinese and Japanese cuisines from the menu, as these are served at the Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory restaurants. It closed on December 31, 2020, at least in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. A second location opened in Oakbrook, Illinois, in November 2017, but closed in December 2019.

===Fox Restaurant Concepts===
On July 31, 2019, the Cheesecake Factory announced it had reached an agreement to buy Phoenix-based Fox Restaurant Concepts (FRC) for $308 million in cash at closing and another $45 million due over the next four years. FRC started in 1998 when 21-year-old founder Sam Fox launched his first restaurant concept Wildflower (unrelated to another Arizona restaurant Wildflower Bread Company) and has since launched additional restaurants in differing categories including North Italia, a specialty restaurant known for pasta, pizza, and other Italian foods. North Italia alone currently has locations in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Other concepts from the FRC portfolio include: Flower Child, Culinary Dropout, Blanco, The Henry, Zinburger, The Arrogant Butcher, Doughbird, Fly Bye, The Greene House, Olive &amp; Ivy, and Pushing Daisies.

==Menu==
The Cheesecake Factory dining menu includes steaks, chops, burgers, chicken, seafood, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, soups, and salads in various cuisines. In addition to its regular dining menu, the company offers a lower-calorie menu that includes salads, burgers, sandwiches, and small plates. The brunch menu is offered on Saturdays and Sundays and includes pancakes, waffles, French toast, and eggs. 

The dessert menu offers 37 cheesecake flavors and cakes, milkshakes, and specialty and ice cream desserts. Per a company spokesperson, the restaurant sells almost 35 million slices of cheesecake annually.

The more than 250 menu items are all made from scratch to order.

===Caloric content===
The Cheesecake Factory has been criticized for featuring large servings of high-calorie and high-fat foods. For these reasons, the chain was dubbed the &quot;worst family restaurant in America&quot; for 2010 by &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine. The average sandwich at the restaurant contains 1,400 calories. In 2013, the Center for Science in the Public Interest gave a better understanding toward some of the food found at the Cheesecake Factory, including the &quot;Crispy Chicken Costoletta&quot; that has more calories (2,610) than a 12-piece bucket of fried chicken from KFC and the Cheesecake Factory&#x27;s &quot;Bistro Shrimp Pasta&quot; dish, which had more calories than any other entrée from a national chain restaurant at 3,120 calories, with 89 grams of saturated fat. The United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion states in its dietary guidelines that a typical female adult should consume about 2,000 calories (males 2,500) and no more than 10% of saturated fat per day. In an attempt to offer healthier, lower-calorie meal options, the Cheesecake Factory created a &quot;Skinnylicious&quot; menu that features a variety of cocktails, salads, appetizers, and specialty dishes such as lemon-garlic shrimp and grilled salmon.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
On March 18, 2020, Overton informed his landlords that his restaurants would be unable to pay rent for April due to significant financial losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but would resume paying rent as soon as possible. Following the close, the restaurants reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

<doc id="1261329" wikidata="Q2717060" url="?curid=1261329" title="Cutthroat trout">
<text>The cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; sp.) is a group of four fish species of the family Salmonidae native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean, Rocky Mountains, and Great Basin in North America. These four species are the Coastal (&quot;O. clarkii&quot;), Westslope (&quot;O. lewisi&quot;), Lahontan (&quot;O. henshawi&quot;), and the Rocky Mountain (&quot;O. virginalis&quot;). As a member of the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;, it is in the Pacific trout group, which includes the widely distributed rainbow trout. Cutthroat trout are popular gamefish, especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing. The common name &quot;cutthroat&quot; refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the lower jaw. The specific name &quot;clarkii&quot; was given to honor explorer William Clark, coleader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They reproduce in clear, cold, moderately deep lakes. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the rivers of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally hybridize with rainbow trout, producing fertile cutbows. Some populations of the coastal cutthroat trout are semi-anadromous.

Several subspecies of cutthroat trout are currently listed as threatened in their native ranges due to habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. Two subspecies, and , are considered extinct. Cutthroat trout are raised in hatcheries to restore populations in their native range, as well as stock non-native lake environments to support angling. The cutthroat trout type species and several subspecies are the official state fish of seven western U.S. states.

==Taxonomy==

Cutthroat trout were the first New World trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541, Spanish explorer Francisco de Coronado recorded seeing trout in the Pecos River near Santa Fe, New Mexico. These were most likely Rio Grande cutthroat trout . The species was first described in the journals of explorer William Clark from specimens obtained during the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the Missouri River near Great Falls, Montana, and these were most likely the westslope cutthroat trout . As one of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s many missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during their expedition, cutthroat trout were given the name in honor of William Clark. In 1836, the type specimen of was described by naturalist John Richardson from a tributary of the lower Columbia River, identified as the &quot;Katpootl&quot;, which was perhaps the Lewis River, as there was a Multnomah village of similar name at the confluence. This type specimen was most likely the coastal cutthroat trout subspecies . Until the 1960s, populations of westslope cutthroat trout and Yellowstone cutthroat trout were lumped into one subspecies; &quot;Salmo clarkii lewisii&quot;. Biologists later split the group into two subspecies, christening the name westslope cutthroat trout with the &quot;lewisii&quot; name which honors explorer Meriwether Lewis and renaming the Yellowstone cutthroat trout &quot;Salmo bouvierii&quot;, the first name given to the Yellowstone cutthroat trout by David Starr Jordan in 1883 honoring a U.S. Army Captain Bouvier.

In 1989, morphological and genetic studies indicated trout of the Pacific Basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; species) than to the &quot;Salmo&quot;s–brown trout or Atlantic salmon of the Atlantic Basin. Thus, in 1989, taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow, cutthroat and other Pacific Basin trout into the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;.

This single species (&quot;O. clarkii)&quot; classification is now changed. Genetic, taxonomic, and geologic studies have determined that cutthroat trout should be divided into four distinct species, with each having multiple subspecies corresponding to the evolutionary lineages found within major river basins, except for the Coastal cutthroat trout.

=== Subspecies and uniquely identifiable evolutionary units ===
Behnke in his salmon and trout handbook of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not all of them were scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented. 

During the annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society (AFS) in 2015, the Western Division of AFS (WDAFS) hosted an expert-panel workshop to evaluate the validity of the currently recognized subspecies, using evidence both for and against. The panel found the Behnke classification scientifically indefensible, and proposed an updated phylogeny and classification that aligns with the corpus of evidence.

One specific detail the panelists were unable to resolve was how to discuss specific subsets of the population. One side favored subspecies as a valuable taxonomic rank, because they represent important information about their evolutionary and ecological history that should be recognized to preserve biodiversity. The other side disagreed, arguing that subspecies do not necessarily align with actual evolutionary units, and are simply designations of lineages within a species based on geography.

To facilitate further discussion without needing to resolve that detail, the panel used the term &quot;uniquely identifiable evolutionary unit&quot; (UIEU) to describe various evolutionary subunits within a species. In short, UIEUs are recognizable population groups that show independence in an evolutionary sense, but do not meet all the criteria to be considered full species.

The evolutionary history of the cutthroat trout is complex and not fully agreed upon by all scientists. What is known is that cutthroat trout were present in the then-forming Lahontan basin 10 million years ago. This, coupled with new information about drainage patterns in western rivers, suggests that the interior radiation and colonization pathways of the cutthroat trout may be different than what was previously thought.

Previously, the first evolutionary theory, based on the work of David Starr Jordan and later Robert J. Behnke, proposed that an ancestral cutthroat trout from Asia entered North America and dispersed inland through the Columbia River basin. The formation of Shoshone Falls on the Snake River then isolated groups of trout, leading to the variety of subspecies seen today. Behnke later modified this theory, suggesting that the Colorado River system was invaded from the Yellowstone and not the upper Arkansas River.

More recently, an alternative theory demonstrates that cutthroat trout originated in the Bonneville Basin and then radiated outwards approximately 4 million years ago. This theory was based on their interpretation of the fossil record and DNA analysis. New evidence, particularly DNA analysis, is providing new insights into the origins and relationships of the different lineages. However, there is still much to be learned about this complex history. What is known is that repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different cutthroats found today.
==Description==

Throughout their native and introduced ranges, cutthroat trout vary widely in size, coloration and habitat selection. Their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back. Cutthroat trout can generally be distinguished from rainbow trout by the presence of basibranchial teeth at the base of tongue and a maxillary that extends beyond the posterior edge of the eye. Depending on subspecies, strain and habitat, most have distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the underside of their mandibles in the lower folds of the gill plates. These markings are responsible for the common name &quot;cutthroat&quot;, first given to the trout by outdoor writer Charles Hallock in an 1884 article in &quot;The American Angler&quot;. These markings are not unique to the species. Some coastal rainbow trout and Columbia River redband trout populations also display reddish or pink throat markings.

At maturity, different populations and subspecies of cutthroat trout can range from in length, depending on habitat and food availability. Sea-run forms of coastal cutthroat trout average . The length and weights of mature inland forms vary widely depending on their particular environment and availability of food. Stream-resident fish are much smaller, , while lacustrine populations have attained weights ranging from in ideal conditions. The largest cutthroat trout subspecies is the Lahontan cutthroat trout . These fish average in small streams and in larger rivers and lakes. In ideal environments, the Lahontan cutthroat trout attains typical weights of . The world record cutthroat trout is a Lahontan at and .

===Lifecycle===
Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams typical of tributaries of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. They spawn in the spring, as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams. Spawning begins when water temperatures reach . Cutthroat trout construct a redd in the stream gravel to lay eggs. The female selects the site for and excavates the redd. Females, depending on size, lay between 200 and 4,400 eggs. Eggs are fertilized with milt (sperm) by an attending male. Eggs hatch into alevins or sac fry in about a month and spend two weeks in the gravel while they absorb their yolk sack before emerging. After emergence, fry begin feeding on zooplankton. Juvenile cutthroat trout typically mature in three to five years. Lake-resident cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production. Lake populations generally require access to gravel-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining, but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation.

Cutthroat trout naturally interbreed with the closely related rainbow trout, producing fertile hybrids commonly called &quot;cutbows&quot;. This hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat trout, usually retaining the characteristic orange-red slash. Cutbow hybrids often pose a taxonomic difficulty when trying to distinguish any given specimen as a rainbow or cutthroat trout. In addition, cutthroat trout may hybridize with , the Gila trout and , the Apache trout in regions where their ranges overlap.

==Ecology==
===Range===

Cutthroat trout are native to western North America and have evolved through geographic isolation into at least 25 genetically-recognizable lineages, each native to a different major drainage basin. Native cutthroat trout species are found along the Pacific Northwest coast from Alaska through British Columbia into northern California, in the Cascade Range, the Great Basin and throughout the Rocky Mountains including southern Alberta. Some coastal populations of the coastal cutthroat trout are semi-anadromous, spending a few months in marine environments to feed as adults and returning to fresh water from fall through early spring to feed on insects and spawn. Cutthroat trout have the second-largest historic native range of North American trout; the lake trout having the largest. Ranges of some subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout , have been reduced to less than 10 percent of their historic range due to habitat loss and introduction of non-native species.

Although members of &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;, the Pacific trout/salmon species, multiple lineages evolved populations east of the Continental Divide in the upper Missouri River basin, upper Arkansas and Platte River basins and upper Yellowstone River basin, each which drain into the Atlantic basin via the Mississippi River (in 2005, researchers published a report stating that a natural distribution of , the Conchos trout, is also located in an Atlantic basin drainage). Scientists believe that the climatic and geologic conditions 3–5 million years ago allowed cutthroat trout from the Snake River to migrate over the divide into the Yellowstone plateau via Two Ocean Pass. There is also evidence that Yellowstone Lake once drained south into the Snake River drainage. Evidence suggests that the westslope cutthroat trout was able to establish populations east of the divide via Summit Lake at Marias Pass which at one time connected the Flathead River drainage with the upper Missouri River drainage. Scientists speculate that there are several mountain passes associated with the headwaters of the Colorado River drainage and Arkansas/Platte River drainages that would have allowed migration of cutthroat trout east of the divide.

Cutthroat trout have been introduced into non-native waters outside their historic native range, but not to the extent of the rainbow trout . Within the native range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, U.S. Fisheries Bureau and National Park Service authorities introduced Yellowstone cutthroat trout into many fishless lakes in Yellowstone National Park. Cutthroat trout were introduced into Lake Michigan tributaries in the 1890s and sporadically in the early 20th century, but never established wild populations. A population of Yellowstone cutthroat trout purportedly has been established in Lake Huron. Cutthroat are routinely introduced by the Arizona Game and Fish Department into high mountain lakes in the White Mountains in the northeastern region of that state.
===Habitat===

Cutthroat trout require cold, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms or cold, moderately deep lakes. Healthy stream-side vegetation that reduces siltation is typical of healthy cutthroat trout habitat and beaver ponds may provide refuge during periods of drought and over winter. Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as nonmigratory, stream-resident or riverine populations. The coastal cutthroat trout is the only cutthroat trout subspecies to coevolve through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout (&quot;O. m. irideus&quot;). Portions of the Westslope cutthroat trout&#x27;s range overlap with the Columbia River redband trout , but the majority of its native range is in headwater tributary streams above major waterfalls and other barriers to upstream migration. At least three subspecies are confined to isolated basins in the Great Basin and can tolerate saline or alkaline water.

Cutthroat trout are opportunistic feeders. Stream-resident cutthroat trout primarily feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic dipterans), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water, fish eggs, small fish, along with crayfish, shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. In saltwater estuaries and along beaches, Coastal cutthroat trout feed on small fish such as sculpins, sand lance, salmon fry and herring. They also consume shrimp, small squid and krill. In fresh water, they consume the same diet as stream resident trout—aquatic insects and crustaceans, amphibians, earthworms, small fish and fish eggs. Within the range of the bull trout the cutthroat trout is a forage fish for the piscivorous bull trout.

===Artificial propagation===

Various subspecies of cutthroat trout are raised in commercial, state and federal hatcheries for introduction into suitable native and non-native riverine and lacustrine environments. In the early 20th century, several hatcheries were established in Yellowstone National Park by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. These hatcheries not only produced stocks of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout for the park, but also took advantage of the great spawning stock of cutthroat trout to supply eggs to hatcheries around the U.S. Between the years 1901 and 1953 a total of 818 million trout eggs were exported from the park to hatcheries throughout the U.S. The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service exists to restore populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout in Pyramid, Walker, Fallen Leaf, June, Marlette, and Gull Lakes and the Truckee River in California and Nevada. The hatchery produces about 300,000–400,000 Lahontan cutthroat trout fry annually. The Jackson National Fish Hatchery produces around 400,000 Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout (which is now known as an ecotype of the Yellowstone cutthroat) annually to support fisheries in Idaho and Wyoming. The Leadville National Fish Hatchery produces 125,000–200,000 Snake River fine-spotted, greenback cutthroat and rainbow trout annually to support fishing in the Fryingpan and Arkansas River drainages and other Colorado waters. The Bozeman Fish Technology Center, formerly a cutthroat trout fish hatchery in Bozeman, Montana, plays a major role in the restoration of the greenback and Westslope cutthroat trout .

==Population threats==
The historic native range of cutthroat trout has been reduced by overfishing, urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, livestock grazing and logging. Population densities have been reduced and in some cases populations have disappeared though competition with non-native brook, brown, lake and rainbow trout, kokanee salmon, lake whitefish and mysis shrimp which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be extirpated from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the trophic cascades resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions. The most serious current threats to several subspecies are interspecific breeding with introduced rainbow trout, creating hybrid cutbows, and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the presence of lake trout in Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in Yellowstone cutthroat trout . Outbreaks of whirling disease in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines. Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to whirling disease, although the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout appears to be resistant to the parasite.

===Interspecific and intraspecific breeding===
The most serious impact on the genetic purity of most cutthroat trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the genes of both parents. In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies. The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies. As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to upstream migrations by introduced species. Fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout and Alvord cutthroat trout subspecies to the introduction of non-native rainbow trout.

===Decline of the Yellowstone subspecies===
The population at the core of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout&#x27;s native range, in Yellowstone Lake, declined significantly in the 1960s due to overharvest of mature cutthroat trout by anglers, as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century. Managers implemented catch and release, which required anglers to return their catches to the lake, and they terminated hatchery operations in the park, which allowed the cutthroat trout to recover. Then, in 1994, park officials discovered lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone, Lewis and Heart Lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions. By 2000, the cutthroat trout population had declined to less than 10 percent of its early 20th century abundance. However, aggressive lake trout eradication programs have killed over 1 million lake trout since 1996, and the hope is that this will lead to a restoration of cutthroat numbers. Cutthroat trout co-exist with lake trout in Heart Lake, an isolated back-country lake at the head of the Heart River that gets little angling pressure.

==Angling==
Cutthroat trout are prized as a gamefish, particularly by fly anglers. They are regulated as a gamefish in every state and province they occur in. From the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in Yellowstone National Park, the unique Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery in Pyramid Lake in Nevada, and the small stream fisheries of the westslope cutthroat trout to saltwater angling for sea-run cutthroat trout on the Pacific coast, cutthroat trout are a popular quarry for trout anglers throughout their ranges. The all-tackle world record is caught in Pyramid Lake in December 1925. Their propensity to feed on aquatic and terrestrial insects make them an ideal quarry for the fly angler.

===Sea-run fishing along the Pacific Coast===
From Alaska to Northern California, coastal cutthroat trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run cutthroat trout fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In addition to a cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.
===Yellowstone fishery===
Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.

In 1902, anticipating the completion of the east entrance road from Cody, Wyoming, Captain Hiram M. Chittenden supervised the construction of the first &quot;Fishing Bridge&quot; across the outlet of Yellowstone Lake. Fishing Bridge was rebuilt in 1919, and reconstructed in
1937, primarily to accommodate vehicle traffic. Between 1916 and 1931, a large development of campgrounds, cabins, stores and service facilities were built just east of the bridge to support anglers. This area is now known as the Fishing Bridge Historic District. The 1937 bridge boasted pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway to give more room to anglers. Angling in the river, at Fishing Bridge and in the lake, boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and over harvest caused a significant decline in the fishery. Consequently, in 1973, fishing was no longer permitted from Fishing Bridge.

===Pyramid Lake Lahontan subspecies fishery===

The Pyramid Lake strain of the Lahontan cutthroat trout, source of the world record and native to Pyramid Lake, Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River, was brought to near-extinction in the two decades between the 1920s-40s from overharvest, introduced species and loss of spawning habitat. In the 1970s, Pyramid Lake was stocked with Lahontan cutthroat trout strains still surviving in some nearby lakes, but they were not the large Pyramid Lake strain. Although the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe had been successful in re-establishing a cutthroat trout fishery on the reservation in Pyramid Lake, the cutthroat trout were not the large fish of the late 19th and early 20th century. In the late 1970, biologists discovered a surviving population of a pure Pyramid Lake strain in a small headwaters stream on the Nevada-Utah border that had at some point around 1900 been introduced into the stream. In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began rearing these fish in the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery in Gardnerville, Nevada. In 2006, the Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout were reintroduced into the lake. As Pyramid Lake has a very shallow shoreline, anglers use ladders to stand comfortably in of water and cast to trout cruising along shoreline breaks. Considered a &quot;world-class&quot; fishery, anglers routinely catch cutthroat trout exceeding .

<text>The California golden trout(Oncorhynchus aguabonitaorOncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita) is a species of trout native to California. The golden trout is normally found in the Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River), Volcano Creek (tributary to Golden Trout Creek), and the South Fork Kern River. The Golden trout is the official freshwater state fish of California since 1947.

The California golden trout is closely related to two rainbow trout subspecies. The Little Kern golden trout (&quot;O. m. whitei&quot;), found in the Little Kern River basin, and the Kern River rainbow trout (&quot;O. m. gilberti&quot;), found in the Kern River system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;golden trout complex&quot;.


==Taxonomy==
Originally the golden trout was described as a subspecies of the salmon species, with a name &quot;Salmo mykiss agua-bonita&quot;, and it is still often considered a subspecies (now called &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita&quot;) along with several other rainbow trout subspecies commonly known as redband trout.

FishBase and the Catalog of Fishes however now (2014) list &quot;O. aguabonita&quot; as an independent species rather than as subspecies of &quot;O. mykiss&quot;. Likewise, while ITIS lists &quot;O. m. whitei&quot; and &quot;O. m. gilberti&quot; as subspecies of &quot;O. mykiss&quot;, &quot;O. aguabonita&quot; instead is listed as a full species.

==Description==
The golden trout has golden flanks with red, horizontal bands along the lateral lines on each side and about 10 dark, vertical, oval marks (called &quot;parr marks&quot;) on each side. Dorsal, lateral and anal fins have white leading edges. In their native habitat, adults range from long. Fish over are considered large. Golden trout that have been transplanted to lakes have been recorded up to .

The golden trout should be distinguished from the similarly named golden rainbow trout, also known as the palomino trout. The golden rainbow is a color variant of the rainbow trout.

The golden trout is commonly found at elevations from to above sea level, and is native to California&#x27;s southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Outside of its native range in California, Golden trout are more often found in cirques and creeks in wilderness areas around elevation, often in higher passes that are not passable without crampons, ice axes, and ropes until after the Fourth of July. Their preferred water temperature is but they can tolerate temperatures in degraded streams on the Kern Plateau as high as so long as those waters cool during the night. The only other species of fish indigenous to the native range of California golden trout is the Sacramento sucker (&quot;Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis&quot;).

=== Record catches ===
The Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Department state record golden trout measured and weighed , caught in Cooks Lake, Wyoming in 1948. The IGFA &quot;All-Tackle Length Record&quot; for &quot;O. m. aguabonita&quot; measured caught in Golden Lake, Wyoming in 2012.

== Distribution ==
&quot;O. m. aguabonita&quot; is native to the southern Sierra Nevada, including the upper reach and tributaries of the South Fork of the Kern River, and Golden Trout Creek and its tributaries. It has been introduced in hundreds of lakes and streams outside the native range, though most of these populations did not last or hybridized with cutthroat trout and other subspecies of rainbow trout.

==History==
In 1892, the California golden trout was originally described by David Starr Jordan, the first President of Stanford University, as &quot;Salmo mykiss agua-bonita&quot;. The fish was named after the Agua Bonita Waterfall where the first specimens were collected, at the mouth of Volcano Creek, at the creek&#x27;s confluence with the Kern River. A century later they were listed as &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita&quot; in Behnke&#x27;s &quot;Native trout of western North America&quot;.

In 1904, Stewart Edward White communicated to his friend President Theodore Roosevelt, that overfishing could lead to extinction of the golden trout. In White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mountains&quot;, he wrote about the threatened golden trout on California&#x27;s Kern Plateau. Roosevelt shared White&#x27;s concern and, through U.S. Fish Commissioner George M. Bowers, dispatched biologist Barton Warren Evermann of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to study the situation. In 1906 Evermann published &quot;The Golden Trout of the Southern High Sierras&quot;. Based on morphology, Evermann accurately described four forms of this native fish: &quot;Salmo roosevelti&quot; from Golden Trout (Volcano) Creek, &quot;Salmo aguabonita&quot; from nearby South Fork of the Kern River, &quot;Salmo whitei&quot; (named in recognition of Stewart Edward White) from the Little Kern River, and &quot;Salmo gilberti&quot;, the Kern River rainbow.

Genetic studies have since clarified three groups of trout native to the Kern River: California golden trout (&quot;O. m. aguabonita&quot;) native to the South Fork Kern River and Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River mainstem but the historic course of the South Fork Kern River and now only separated from it by a lava flow and ridge of sediment), Little Kern River golden trout (&quot;O. m. whitei&quot;), and Kern River rainbow trout (&quot;O. m. gilberti&quot;).

==Conservation==
Years of overexploitation, mismanagement and competition with exotic species have brought golden trout to the brink of being designated as &quot;threatened&quot;. Introduced brook trout (&quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;) outcompete them for food, introduced brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) prey on them and introduced rainbow trout (&quot;O. mykiss&quot;) hybridize with them, damaging the native gene pool through introgression. Populations have been in steady decline for decades.

In 1978, the Golden Trout Wilderness was established within Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Forest, protecting the upper watersheds of the Kern River and South Fork Kern River. It also resulted in the closure of the Tunnel Air Camp airstrip and air charters operations for sport fishermen in the region.

In September 2004, the California Department of Fish and Game signed an agreement with federal agencies to work on restoring back-country habitat, heavily damaged by overgrazing from cattle and sheep, as part of a comprehensive conservation strategy.

The US Endangered Species Act (USESA) designated the subspecies &quot;O. m. whitei&quot; as LT, or Listed Threatened, since 1978, under the name &quot;Oncorhynchus aguabonita whitei&quot;.

===Subspecies designations===
NatureServe has designated the following NatureServe Conservation Status for the three subspecies:

* &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita&quot;—Golden trout (G5T1): Critically Imperiled, last reviewed in 2013. The primary threat is hybridization and introgression with stocked rainbow trout. Other threats include competition with non-native brown trout and rainbow trout, predation by brown trout, habitat degradation from cattle grazing, and possibly expanding beaver populations in the native range. Genetic studies showed hybridization with stocked rainbow trout in almost all known wild populations analyzed to as of 2003. Non-hybridized populations are restricted to less than 1% of their native range, and confinement to these areas for long periods create a significant risk of inbreeding depression, and loss of heterozygosity and genetic variance.
* &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss gilberti&quot;—Kern River rainbow trout (G5T1Q): Critically Imperiled, with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005. Few if any genetically pure populations still exist. Primary threats include continued introgression with introduced rainbow trout, habitat loss from grazing, logging and road building, unpredictable events such as floods, drought, and fire (and subsequent landslides), and reduced habitat availability due to introduced beaver.
* &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss whitei&quot;—Little Kern golden trout (G5T2Q): Imperiled, with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005. Hybridization with introduced rainbow trout is considered a threat, and &quot;there is a constant threat from introductions of other salmonids by disgruntled anglers.&quot; The subspecies still occurs in the Little Kern River, above the falls on the lower river, though some populations show signs of introgression with coastal rainbow trout.

The American Fisheries Society has designated all three subspecies as Threatened since August 2008.

==Translocations outside of endemic range==
For sportfishing, the golden trout underwent many twentieth century translocations into multiple Western states and established populations survive in California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, Colorado, and Wyoming. Populations in the high-elevation lakes in the Ruby Mountains, Nevada, have died out. The current status in other states where the California golden trout were planted (Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon) lacks documentation.

However, a former New Mexico population is relatively well known and storied as, when then-Colonel Chuck Yeager introduced one of his commanding officers, General Irving &quot;Twig&quot; Branch, to the Sierra Nevada populations of golden trout, Branch ordered Yeager and Bud Anderson to introduce the species to the mountain streams of New Mexico. These New Mexico populations have since also died out. In his second memoir, &quot;Press On&quot;, Yeager detailed his annual fishing trips to catch golden trout which he extols as one of the best game fish and best eating fish to be found.

A self-sustaining introduced population also exists in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada; the province&#x27;s golden trout population is managed by translocating fish between lakes to balance populations, but no new fish from other populations are introduced.

<text>The Apache trout or Arizona trout (Oncorhynchus apache), is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family (family Salmonidae) of order Salmoniformes. It is one of the Pacific trouts.

==Description==
The Apache trout measures in length from , and weighs between . It rarely exceeds , but can reach up to in its native, headwater streams. Apache trout are a yellowish-gold color with a golden belly and have medium-sized dark spots that are evenly spaced and that may extend below the lateral line and onto the dorsal and tail fins. The top of its head and back are dark olive in color, and it has the appearance of having a black stripe/mask through each of its eyes, due to two small black dots on either side of the pupil. There can be a throat mark below the lower jaw, ranging in color from yellow to gold.

==Distribution==
The Apache trout is the state fish of Arizona, and is one of only two species of trout native to that state, with the other being the gila trout (&quot;O. g. gilae&quot;). It natively lives in clear, cool streams in the White Mountains that flow through coniferous forests and marshes, but has been introduced into several lakes in the area. The Apache trout is native to the upper Salt River watershed (Black and White rivers) and the upper Little Colorado River watershed. Apache trout have been introduced into isolated streams outside of their historic range in the Pinaleño Mountains and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Apache trout exist in their most pure form within headwater streams at an elevation of 2,100m or higher in the White Mountain Apache Reservation.
==Life history==
The Apache trout spawns from March to the middle of June, and varies with elevations. Maturity was found to occur in three years, and fecundity is based on the size of trout. One female typically produces from 72 to 240 eggs in fish and from 646 to 1,083 eggs in fish. The eggs hatch after 30 days. The Apache trout eats both terrestrial and aquatic insects, such as Trichoptera and Diptera. In lakes, they also eat small fishes and zooplankton.

==Conservation==

Recovery and management efforts for Apache trout have been ongoing since the 1940s. Apache trout are raised in federal and state hatcheries, and reared fish have been used to assist with recovery and to maintain populations for sport fishing in certain streams and reservoirs.

While the IUCN considers the Apache trout to be critically endangered, it is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Around 100 years ago, they could be found in of streams in the White Mountains. By the late 1960s, their range had been reduced to around of these streams. Once the Endangered Species Act of 1969 was passed, they became one of the first species listed under it. When this act was replaced by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, they became one of the first fish species protected under the newer Act. Population numbers for this species are still rising.

Today, major risks to the Apache trout are its easy hybridization with the rainbow trout and major forest fires. Cutthroat trout are also genetically similar and cross-breed with Apache trout, compromising the genetic purity of each species. The range of the Apache trout remains limited, which puts it at risk, but it is now common enough that limited fishing is permitted.

Ongoing conservation efforts by the White Mountain Apache Tribe have helped to preserve the subspecies.

Many of the Mount Baldy headwater streams that are the stronghold of Apache trout are entirely closed to fishing. Catch and release fishing opportunities for wild (stream born), pure-strain Apache trout exist in a limited number of areas. Additionally, there are numerous consumptive fishing opportunities for Apache trout in waters where natural reproduction is not occurring and the Apache trout population is the result of stocking efforts.

The 2011 Wallow Fire resulted in the loss of stream barriers erected to prevent hybridization and the extirpation of Apache trout from Coleman Creek and likely of hybridized populations elsewhere, while the 2017 Frye Fire destroyed a stocked population in Ash Creek in the Pinaleño Mountains. Climate change causing rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires threatens the existence of Apache trout.

<text>The Yuan dynasty was an imperial dynasty of China, proclaimed on 18 December 1271 by Kublai Khan, which succeeded the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty. It also functioned as a continuation of the Mongol Empire, which was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206, but which subsequently split into four autonomous states. The emperors of the Yuan dynasty thus comprise both Kublai&#x27;s successors as rulers of China and his predecessors up to his grandfather Genghis, who was retrospectively presented as the founder of the dynasty. 

The rulers of the Yuan dynasty were nominally superior to those of the other three post-Mongol states, but each was &quot;de facto&quot; independent of the others and occupied with their own territories. The Yuan dynasty adopted Han political traditions, including the use of posthumous names, temple names and era names. Aside from the title of emperor, Yuan rulers also concurrently held the title of khagan. 

Although the reigns of Kublai and his successor Temür were generally peaceful, weaknesses in the Yuan administration became apparent and led to a gradual breakdown of political stability. By the mid-14th century, the Yuan state became impossible to govern, and in 1368 the last emperor, Toghon Temür, was forced to flee China proper. His descendants continued to rule a rump state in Inner Mongolia, known as the Northern Yuan, until 1634.

==Background==

Through years of campaigning, Genghis Khan ( – 1227) unified the tribes of the Mongolian steppe and was crowned khan of the Mongol Empire, or , in 1206. The campaigns of the following decades saw Mongol armies invade and conquer China, Central Asia, Persia and much of the Middle East, and Russia. However, different branches of Genghis Khan&#x27;s line became dominant in differing areas. As a result, by 1265, the once-united empire had begun to split into four independent states: the Golden Horde in modern-day Russia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Ilkhanate in the Near East, and a regime in China which was ruled by Genghis&#x27;s grandson Kublai Khan and which was nominally superior to the rest.

To appease his Han Chinese-majority population, Kublai declared the foundation of a new imperial dynasty titled . Essentially a way to convey the in Chinese conventions, the Yuan was officially proclaimed on 18 December 1271. As the dynasty was regarded as a continuation of the Mongol Empire, contemporary writers retroactively described Genghis Khan as the dynastic founder; the post-1271 emperors styled themselves as Mongol khans. They continued the tradition, dating from the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), of the ruling head of state being known as &quot;huangdi&quot;, or emperor. In Chinese historical texts, emperors of the Yuan dynasty, along with the Tang and Song dynasties, are referred to by their temple names; they also had posthumous names and normally multiple era names.

Kublai presided over the final conquest of the Song dynasty, which had preceded the Yuan. Although his reign was generally long and prosperous, weaknesses in the Yuan&#x27;s economy, society, and administration became apparent after the death of his successor Temür in 1307, culminating in two decades of near-anarchy between 1320 and 1340. Although the emperor Toghon Temür then managed to set up a stable government, an economic crisis led to a breakdown of the social order, and the powerful warlord Zhu Yuanzhang, having forced Toghon Temür to flee, established the Ming dynasty in 1368. Members of the Yuan dynasty continued to rule a rump state in the Mongol heartland, commonly known as the Northern Yuan, until 1634.

<text>Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, also known as TCL Chinese Theatre for sponsorship reasons, is a movie palace on the historic Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States.

The original Chinese Theatre was commissioned following the success of the nearby Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, which opened in 1922. Both were built as Exotic Revival style architecture. Built by a partnership headed by Sid Grauman over 18 months beginning in January 1926, the theater opened May 18, 1927, with the premiere of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The King of Kings&quot;. It has since been home to many premieres, including the 1977 debut of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as many private events and three Academy Awards ceremonies. Among the theater&#x27;s features are the concrete blocks set in the forecourt, which bear the signatures, footprints, and handprints of popular motion picture personalities from the 1920s to the present day.

Originally named Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, it was renamed Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in 1973, and reverted to its original name in 2001. On January 11, 2013, Chinese electronics manufacturer TCL Corporation purchased the facility&#x27;s naming rights for $5 million.

In 2013, the Chinese Theatre partnered with IMAX Corporation to convert the house into a custom-designed IMAX theater. The newly renovated theater seats 932 people and features one of the largest movie screens in North America.

==History==
In March 1923, a meeting occurred at the offices of Fox West Coast Theatres where Sid Grauman, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and several other executives discussed plans for a new venue that would be dedicated to &quot;the spoken drama&quot; with films only being screened on rare occasions. Although the project called for immediate construction, it was ultimately shelved for three years. In that time, several of its aspects were altered, including a change in scope from play house to movie theater due to the increasing profitability of motion pictures.

Grauman, a theater mogul who previously founded the Million Dollar Theater and Egyptian Theatre, moved forward with the plans for a new venue in 1925. Looking to build along Hollywood Boulevard, he leased the site of actor Francis X. Bushman&#x27;s mansion in a deal brokered by real estate developer Charles E. Toberman. In appreciation, a plaque was installed on the front of the theater dedicating it to Bushman.

Los Angeles-based architecture firm Meyer &amp; Holler, which previously partnered with Grauman on the Egyptian, designed the &quot;palace-type&quot; Chinese Theatre. Raymond M. Kennedy served as principal architect on the project. In October 1925, local newspapers published an artist&#x27;s impression of the planned theater&#x27;s facade. The accounts promised a cost as well as a &quot;tropical garden&quot; in the forecourt, complete with imported flowers, trees, and fish in ponds. In contrast to early reports, the theater cost $2.1 million to construct. Grauman co-owned the venue with Pickford, Fairbanks, Howard Schenck, and West Coast Theatres.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Chinese Theatre occurred on the evening of January 5, 1926. Newspapers advertised the public event as the founding of &quot;the world&#x27;s most unusual playhouse&quot;. Celebrities at the ceremony included Grauman, Charlie Chaplin, Conrad Nagel, Norma Talmadge, and Anna May Wong. Talmadge and Wong turned the first spadeful of earth using a gold-plated shovel. Wong also put the first rivet into the structure of the theater.

During construction, Grauman hired Jean Klossner to formulate an extremely hard concrete for the forecourt of the theater. Klossner later became known as &quot;Mr. Footprint&quot;, performing the footprint ceremonies from 1927 through 1957.

Many stories exist to explain the origins of the footprints. The theater&#x27;s official account credits Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast of a radio adaptation of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was &quot;pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it.&quot;

Another account, says that the original &quot;accidental&quot; slabs were made and stayed, at the curb, on the sidewalk, until 1958, when they were removed for the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

When they stepped up off the curb, they accidentally walked on wet cement and left a trail of footprints from the street to the front doors of the theater ... The stars, seeing what they had done, grabbed a nail on the ground and signed their names next to their footprints, Pickford even dated it.&quot; — Marc Wanamaker, Hollywood Heritage Museum.

Still another account by Klossner recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. (Note: In 1949, Klossner&#x27;s story changed to say that Grauman had accidentally stepped into the wet concrete.) The theater&#x27;s third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity after Talmadge to be immortalized in the concrete.

In 1929, Grauman decided to retire and sell his share to William Fox&#x27;s Fox Theatres chain. However, just a few months later, Howard Hughes convinced Grauman to return to the theater, because he wanted Grauman to produce the world premiere of his aviation epic &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which would also feature one of Grauman&#x27;s theatrical prologs before the film. Grauman remained as the theater&#x27;s managing director for the entire run of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, retiring once again after its run finished. Unsatisfied with retirement, though, Grauman returned to the theater as managing director on Christmas Day 1931 and kept that position until his death in 1950.

The Chinese Theatre hosted the 1944, 1945, and 1946 Academy Awards ceremonies; they are now held at the adjacent Dolby Theatre, formerly known as the Kodak Theatre.

One of the highlights of the Chinese Theatre has always been its grandeur and décor. In 1952, John Tartaglia, the artist of nearby Saint Sophia Cathedral, became the head interior decorator of the Chinese Theatre, as well as the theater chain then owned by Fox West Coast Theatres. He later continued the work of Klossner, by recommendation of J. Walter Bantau, for the Hollywood footprint ceremonies.

Tartaglia performed his first ceremony as what the City of Los Angeles termed &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Master Mason&quot; for Jean Simmons in 1953, for the premiere of &quot;The Robe&quot;, the first premiere in CinemaScope. Although replacing Klossner was initially thought to be a temporary job for Tartaglia, his dedication resulted in a 35-year career in which he last performed as the master mason/concrete artist in honor of Eddie Murphy in May 1987. Tartaglia was formally recognized by the City of Los Angeles in October 2011.
The Chinese Theatre was declared a historic and cultural landmark in 1968, and has undergone restoration projects in the years since then. Ted Mann, owner of the Mann Theatres chain and husband of actress Rhonda Fleming, purchased it in 1973. From then until 2001, it was known as Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. Mann Theatres grew to become the largest independent chain in the country before Mann sold the business, including the Chinese Theatre, to Gulf+Western in 1986.

In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the Chinese Theater listed as a contributing property in the district.

In 1988, Time Warner predecessor Warner Communications Inc. bought a 50% stake from Gulf+Western for $150 million. The theater chain was eventually sold to WestStar Holdings in 1997. In 2000, a partnership of Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures acquired the theater, along with the other Mann Theatres properties.

In 2000, Behr Browers Architects, a firm previously engaged by Mann Theatres, prepared a restoration and modernization program for the structure. The program included a seismic upgrade, new state-of-the-art sound and projection, new vending kiosks, and exterior signage, and the addition of a larger concession area under the balcony. The program began in 2002 and restored the original name — &quot;Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&quot; — to the cinema palace. As part of the upgrade, Behr Browers also designed a new Chinese-themed six-plex in the attached Hollywood and Highland shopping center that continued to operate under the name Mann&#x27;s Chinese 6 Theatre.

In 2007, the CIM Group purchased the land on which the theater sits for an undisclosed price from the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation of New York and Barlow Respiratory Hospital of Los Angeles. CIM Group also owns the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, as well as numerous other residential and commercial properties in Hollywood. On May 27, 2011, Chinese Theatres LLC, a partnership owned by producer Elie Samaha and Donald Kushner, purchased both Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre and the adjacent Mann Chinese 6.

Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre was sold for $25 million in 2013, and today it continues to serve the public as a first-run movie theater.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
Raymond M. Kennedy, a Southern California architect of the firm Meyer &amp; Holler, designed the Chinese Theatre at the behest of owner Sid Grauman. Prior to conceiving the Exotic Revival-style plan for the Chinese Theatre, Meyer &amp; Holler had previously designed the similarly themed West Coast Theatre in Long Beach. Plans called for an ambitious venue that would cost to construct, considered a very high budget for a movie theater at the time.

The exterior&#x27;s most notable feature is the -tall pagoda centered in the middle of the forecourt. The pagoda&#x27;s upright structure is supported by two prominent red pillars and its roof is plated in bronze. The design features numerous traditional Chinese ornamentations, including a -tall stone-carved mural of a dragon on the central wall between the columns. Two Ming dynasty-era guardian lion statues flank the venue&#x27;s entrance. The U.S. government granted permission for the statues, as well as temple bells and other artifacts, to be imported from China. Moon Quon, a Chinese poet and filmmaker, traveled to the United States to oversee a team of Chinese artisans tasked with creating the theater&#x27;s traditional decoration. Xavier Cugat painted the trees and foliage between the pillars on the side walls and Keye Luke painted the Chinese murals in the lobby.

===Interior===
The auditorium features a sixty-foot-wide ornate doily on its ceiling with various silver dragon emblems and gold medallions. A bronze chandelier fashioned to appear as a lantern hangs from the center of the doily. The theater&#x27;s color scheme is primarily various shades of red – ruby, crimson, pale scarlet, and coral lacquer – with bronze, gold, stone, and silver providing accents. Author Charles Beardsley likened the auditorium to a &quot;gigantic shrine at the time of the Five Emperors or the Dynasty of Hsia&quot;.

In its original configuration, the auditorium included a -wide, -deep, -high stage, one of the largest in the world. The stage was divided into sections, making it possible to recess it into a -deep pit below in order to quickly change sets during live productions. The theater used &quot;its own power plant&quot; and an &quot;auxiliary dynamo system&quot; to generate its electricity independent of the city power grid.

Despite the grandiose nature and high construction cost of the theater, its original capacity of 2,258 was only about half of the seats that the largest movie palaces had at the time. The lack of a proper general-admission balcony partly contributed to its smaller size; instead, the auditorium features four private box suites.

The Chinese Theatre was the first commercial movie theater to have air conditioning. The vents are concealed behind the imported decorative pillars on the side walls of the auditorium. The interior design also features a concealed three-manual, 17-rank Wurlitzer organ; its pipes were above the proscenium with tone chutes directing the sound through holes in the ceiling to make the sounds &quot;feel like they were descending from the heavens.&quot; In 1957, theater ownership removed the organ and gave it to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who in turn installed most of its parts at the St. Finbar Church in Burbank.

A concession stand was not in the theater&#x27;s original plans, because Grauman thought it would detract from the theatrical experience. The theater began to sell concessions in the 1930s.

==Handprints==
Nearly 200 Hollywood celebrity handprints, footprints, and autographs are in the concrete of the theater&#x27;s forecourt. Fairbanks and Pickford were the first, done on April 30, 1927.
Variations of this honored tradition are imprints of Harold Lloyd&#x27;s eyeglasses, Groucho Marx&#x27;s cigar, Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s dreadlock, the wands used by &quot;Harry Potter&quot; stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, John Barrymore&#x27;s facial profile (reflecting his nickname &quot;The Great Profile&quot;), Betty Grable&#x27;s leg, and Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s earring.

Western stars William S. Hart and Roy Rogers left imprints of their revolvers. John Wayne left his boot and fist prints, Herbie, a Volkswagen Beetle, left the imprints of his tires. The hoofprints of Tom Mix&#x27;s horse, Tony, Gene Autry&#x27;s horse, Champion, and Rogers&#x27; horse, Trigger, were left in the concrete beside those of their owners.

Since 2011, a surge of concrete ceremonies has occurred, many of which have been paid for by movie studios for publicity reasons. One of the theater&#x27;s current owners, Donald Kushner, acknowledged this and referred to them as mock ceremonies. This influx has been a matter of concern for film buffs and historians, as well as misleading for fans. However, despite the increase of concrete blocks, the ones placed within the forecourt are still chosen by a special committee which selects celebrities based on their contributions to Hollywood cinema. Practice blocks, completed inside the theater before the ceremony, are placed on the walls of the Chinese 6 Theatre lobby, which is also used as an event space.

==IMAX conversion==
In April 2013, owners announced plans to convert the original theater for IMAX. The new silver screen is curved and can be masked for premieres and screening events of non-IMAX films. To accommodate better sightlines and a taller screen, seating was re-arranged in stepped rows, descending from street level to the floor of the former basement.

The auditorium&#x27;s decorative walls and ceiling remain unaltered, the existing curtain was extended, decorative lighting effects were added and TCL added digital signage. The theater reopened on September 20, 2013, with the IMAX 3D version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Although it opened with only a digital projection system, a 70 mm IMAX projection system was temporarily installed for the runs of &quot;Interstellar&quot; and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; in 2014 and 2023 respectively. Because of the success of the &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; run, the 70 mm projection system was kept in 2024 for the re-release of &quot;Tenet&quot; and the release of &quot;.&quot;

In April 2015, the IMAX system was upgraded to use the new dual-4K IMAX with Laser projector system for the premiere of &quot;Furious 7&quot;.

==Recreations==
A full-scale recreation of the Chinese Theatre&#x27;s exterior facade and lobby exists at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The recreation originally housed The Great Movie Ride which opened with the park on May 1, 1989, and closed on August 13, 2017. Its replacement attraction, Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway, opened on March 4, 2020. It also has concrete handprints inside the sidewalks from the years 1988–1995.

A sized-down recreation of the Chinese Theatre, both interior and exterior was built at Parque Warner Madrid theme park in San Martín de la Vega, near Madrid, Spain. The building shows films relevant to Warner Bros., previously &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; and &quot;Storks&quot;. During Halloween, horror films for guests over the age of 18 are shown such as &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

==In popular culture==
===Films===
The Chinese Theater has appeared in multiple films set in Los Angeles, including &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;.

Janet Gaynor visits the courtyard and a number of the signatures and footprints are seen in the 1937 movie &quot;A Star is Born&quot;—including Harold Lloyd&#x27;s glasses, Joe E. Brown&#x27;s &quot;mouthprint&quot;, Jean Harlow&#x27;s handprints, Eddie Cantor&#x27;s &quot;eyes&quot;, Shirley Temple&#x27;s &quot;Love to you all&quot; message, and the fictitious Norman Maine&#x27;s footprints.

===Video games===
A building known as the Oriental Theater, which is based on the Chinese Theater, makes an appearance in the 2013 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.

The theater also makes an appearance in the 2001 game, &quot;S.W.A.T. 3&quot;, Game Of The Year Edition.

<doc id="1261350" wikidata="Q1394378" url="?curid=1261350" title="Seal of Utah">
<text>The Great Seal of the [[Utah|State of Utah]] was adopted on April 3, 1896, at the first regular session of the Legislature (January, February, March, April 1896). The original seal was designed by Harry Edwards &amp; C. M. Jackson and cost $65.00, . The great seal is described in Utah Code Annotated, 1953, Volume 7a, section 67-2-9 as follows:

==Seal of the governor==
There is also an official seal of the governor of Utah. Borrowing most of the same symbolism from the state seal, the Governor&#x27;s seal includes Roman numerals at the bottom, which represent the Governor himself, and this changes with every new Governor. Each Governor therefore has a seal unique to themselves and their administration. The Roman numerals are currently &quot;XVIII&quot;, representing Spencer Cox, who is the 18th governor of Utah since statehood. The seal was designed after the California Governor&#x27;s Seal by Ronald L. Fox of Salt Lake City, Utah in 1992.

==Enhanced variant==
An artist at the Colonial Flag Company, produced the artwork for the corrected Utah State flag used during the Legislative process. The flag was drawn following the legal description and using the colors of the flag made for presentation to the in 1912. Although colors were not included in the law describing the Utah State Flag as adopted in 1912 and amended in 1913, they were described in other state documents. Utah officials asked that those colors be used. However, they declined to include an illustration with the House Concurrent Resolution, saying that was not possible.

As with many flags with seals and coats of arms, there is room for artistic interpretation while still following correct designs. Paul Swenson, who as the President of Colonial Flag Company had paid for the prototype design, felt the eagle as shown in that design was weak and unattractive. He had graphic artist Perry Van Schelt strengthen the design while following the same description and using the same colors as employed in the prototype. Advisors in the project included John Hartvigsen, David Rindlisbach and Ronald L. Fox, Fox suggested the flag on the seal would have 45 stars divided between the two U.S. Flags shown on the seal, Utah was the 45th State. Both the prototype and the enhance designs are correct and follow the law and intent of the 2011 legislation. Only a few hundred flags were ordered using the prototype design, and most flags now being made and sold use the enhanced design, but legally flag manufacturers are free to use either version.

<doc id="1261355" wikidata="Q1795989" url="?curid=1261355" title="The King of Kings (1927 film)">
<text>The King of Kings is a 1927 American synchronized sound epic film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille. It depicts the last weeks of Jesus before his crucifixion and stars H. B. Warner in the lead role. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the RCA Photophone sound-on-film process.

Featuring the opening and resurrection scenes in two-color Technicolor, the film is the second in DeMille&#x27;s Biblical trilogy, preceded by &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1923) and followed by &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; (1932).

==Plot==

Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a wild courtesan, entertaining many men around her. Upon learning that Judas is with a carpenter she rides out on her chariot drawn by zebras to get him back. Peter is introduced as the Giant apostle, and we see the future gospel writer Mark as a child who is healed by Jesus. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown as a beautiful and saintly woman who is a mother to all her son&#x27;s followers. The first sight of Jesus is through the eyesight of a little girl, whom he heals. He is surrounded by a halo. Mary Magdelene arrives afterwards and talks to Judas, who reveals that he is only staying with Jesus in hopes of being made a high official after Jesus becomes the king of kings. Jesus casts the Seven Deadly Sins out of Mary Magdalene in a multiple exposure sequence.

Jesus is also shown healing a boy possessed by a demon, resurrecting Lazarus from the dead and healing the little children. Some humor is derived when one girl asks if he can heal broken legs, and, when he says yes, she gives him a legless doll. Jesus smiles and repairs the doll. The crucifixion is foreshadowed when Jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father&#x27;s carpentry shop, and, himself a carpenter&#x27;s son, he briefly helps carve a piece of wood. When a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over Jesus.

Jesus and his apostles enter Jerusalem, where Judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim Jesus as the King of the Jews. Jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an Earthly king. Caiaphas the High Priest is also angry at Judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. Meanwhile, Jesus drives away Satan, who had offered him an Earthly kingdom, and he protects a woman caught in adultery. The words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed.

Judas, desperate to save himself from Caiaphas, agrees to turn over Jesus. Noticeably at the Last Supper, when Jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are his body and blood, Judas refuses to eat or drink. Towards the end, Mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. Jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples.

Jesus goes to the Garden of Gethsemane where he is soon captured by the Roman soldiers and betrayed by Judas. Judas&#x27; life is saved, but, upon seeing that Jesus is going to be killed as a result, he is horrified. Judas takes a rope that the Romans had used to bind Jesus&#x27; wrists and runs off. Jesus is beaten and then presented by Pontius Pilate to the crowd. Mary pleads for the life of her son and Mary Magdalene speaks for him but Caiaphas bribes the crowd to shout against Jesus.

Jesus is taken away to be crucified, though he pauses on the Via Dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, despite his weakened condition. Jesus is crucified and his enemies throw insults at him. (One woman even anachronistically eats popcorn and smiles with glee at Jesus&#x27; crucifixion.) When Jesus does die, however, there is a great earthquake. The tree where Judas had hanged himself, with the rope used to bind Jesus&#x27;s wrists, is swallowed up amidst bursts of hellfire. The sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked Jesus run in terror, and the veil covering the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple is torn in two.

The tumult ends when Mary looks up at heaven and asks God to forgive the world for the death of their son. The chaos ends and the sun shines. Jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. On the third day, he rises from the dead as promised. To emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise tinted monochrome film is shot in Technicolor. Jesus goes to the Apostles and tells them to spread his message to the world. He tells them &quot;I am with you always&quot; as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that Jesus still watches over his followers.

Many of the film&#x27;s intertitles are quotes (or paraphrases) from Scripture, often with chapter and verse accompanying.

==Production==

A giant gate built for this film was later used in the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;, and was among the sets torched for the &quot;burning of Atlanta&quot; in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Other sets and costumes were re-used for the 1965 Elvis Presley film, &quot;Harum Scarum&quot;.

The movie has two Technicolor sequences, the beginning and the resurrection scene, which use the two-color process invented by Herbert Kalmus.

The 1927 Cummings trial for divorce from her husband Frank Elliott revealed that DeMille, because Christians would not accept any reflections cast upon Christ or his mother, had Cummings sign a contract on August 21, 1926, that regulated her private life for seven years. It included clauses that precluded her from divorcing her husband for any act, to do anything that would give her husband grounds for divorce, or to play a prostitute or similar role in any film. The contract did not prevent the divorce.

==Release==
&quot;The King of Kings&quot; was the first movie that premiered at the noted Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California on May 18, 1927. The film was screened there again on May 24, 1977, to commemorate the theater&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In what is considered one of the earliest applications of market segmentation to film promotion, students ranging from elementary to high school were dismissed early to attend afternoon screenings of the film. &quot;The King of Kings&quot; was seen by around 500 million viewers between its original release in 1927 and the remake released in 1961.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The King of Kings&quot; received praise from critics. &quot;The Film Daily&quot; stated: &quot;There can be said nothing but praise for the reverence and appreciation with which the beautiful story has been developed. . . &quot;The King of Kings&quot; is tremendous from every standpoint. It is the finest piece of screen craftsmanship ever turned out by DeMille&quot;. &quot;Photoplay&quot; described the film as &quot;Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s finest motion picture effort&quot; and thought he took &quot;the most difficult and exalted theme in the world&#x27;s history—the story of Jesus Christ—and transcribed it intelligently and ably to the screen.&quot; Norbert Lusk of &quot;Picture Play&quot; believed &quot;&quot;The King of Kings&quot; is Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s masterpiece, and is among the greatest of all pictures. It is a sincere and reverent visualization of the last three years in the life of Christ, produced on a scale of tasteful magnificence, finely acted by the scores in it, and possessed of moments of poignant beauty and unapproachable drama. This is a picture that will never become outmoded.&quot;

==Accolades==
In June 1927, &quot;Photoplay&quot; named the film one of &quot;The Best Pictures of the Month&quot;. For their work in &quot;The King of Kings&quot;, H. B. Warner, Victor Varconi, Rudolph Schildkraut, and Ernest Torrence were included among &quot;The Best Performances of the Month&quot;. It is widely considered to be among the most popular Hollywood biblical epic films depicting the life of Christ.

==Censorship==
Film censorship in the United States in the 1920s was performed by several state and city censor boards. The Memphis Board of Censors ordered cut 900 feet of the film depicting the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus, but the Lyric Theatre in Memphis, under guidance provided by Pathé, showed the film uncut starting on March 5, 1928, which led to the arrest of the theatre manager Vincent Carline. A lower court held that the censor board decisions were subject to court review and released the manager, allowing the film to be shown without interference from police or the censor board. However, on appeal this decision was reversed by the Tennessee Court of Appeals, which held that the acts of the Memphis Censor Board were not subject to judicial review provided the board did not exceed its authority, so the board&#x27;s cuts to the film were legal and final.

In the United Kingdom, the film was initially banned by the London County Council due to a rule that prohibited films from showing a materialized Christ, which led to a revision of the local censorship rules.

==Lawsuit==
In 1928, actress Valeska Surratt and scholar Mirza Ahmad Sohrab sued DeMille for stealing the scenario for &quot;The King of Kings&quot; from them. The case went to trial in February 1930 but eventually was settled without additional publicity. Surratt, who had left films to return to the stage in 1917, appeared to be unofficially blacklisted after the suit.

<text>The American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;) is a species of anadromous clupeid fish naturally distributed on the North American coast of the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Florida, and as an introduced species on the North Pacific coast. The American shad is not closely related to the other North American shads. Rather, it seems to form a lineage that diverged from a common ancestor of the European taxa before these diversified.

The American shad has been described as &quot;the fish that fed the (American) nation&#x27;s founders&quot;. Adult shad weigh between , and they have a delicate flavor when cooked. It is considered flavorful enough not to require sauces, herbs, or spices. It can be boiled, filleted and fried in butter, or baked. Traditionally, a little vinegar is sprinkled over it on the plate. In the Eastern United States, roe shads (females) are prized because the eggs are considered a delicacy.

The name &quot;shad&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;sceadd&quot;, meaning &quot;herring&quot;; it is a cognate to Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic words for herring.

==Life history==
The shad spends most of its life in the Atlantic Ocean but swims up freshwater rivers to spawn. Northern populations are iteroparous. Thus, they may survive breeding, return to the sea, and then return to fresh waters to spawn several more times. However, southern populations exhibit semelparity, similar to Pacific salmon. In the marine environment, shad are schooling fish. Thousands are often seen at the surface in spring, summer, and autumn. They are hard to find in the winter, as they tend to go deeper before spawning season in the range ; they have been pulled up in nets as deep as .

Like other herrings, the American shad is primarily a plankton feeder but eats small shrimp and fish eggs. Occasionally, they eat small fish, but these are only a minor item in their general diet.

The sexually mature American shad enter coastal rivers in spring or early summer, usually when the river water has warmed to . Cooler water appears to interrupt the spawn. Consequently, the shad run correspondingly later in the year passing from south to north along the coast, commencing in Georgia in January; in March in the waters tributary to Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds; in April in the Potomac; and in May and June in northern streams generally from Delaware to Canada.

American shad run far upstream in large rivers, such as the Connecticut. The apparent longest distance is in the St. Johns River of Florida, an extremely slow (drops 1 in per mile, 1.5 cm per km) river that widens into large lakes; shad have been found upriver.

The spawning fish select sandy or pebbly shallows and deposit their eggs primarily between sundown and midnight. Females release eggs in batches of about 30,000 eggs, though very large fish deposit an estimated as many as 156,000 eggs. Total annual egg production is 200,000–600,000 eggs per female, with larger fish producing more. In rivers north of Cape Fear, the spent fish, now very emaciated, return to the sea immediately after spawning. In southern rivers, most shad die after spawning.

The eggs are transparent, pale pink, or amber, and being semibuoyant and not sticky like those of other herrings, they roll about on the bottom with the current. The eggs hatch in 12 to 15 days at , in six to eight days at , which covers the range characteristic of Maine and Bay of Fundy rivers during the season of incubation.

The fry are about long. Juvenile shad remain in the rivers until fall when they move down to salt water; they are now long, resembling their parents in appearance.

==Ecology and diet==
As adults, shad filter feed at sea and during their return journey to spawn. They are pursued and hunted primarily by striped bass and, at times, harbor seals. They may not actively feed on their return and are caught with special &#x27;dart&#x27; lures instead of typical bait.
==Nutritional information==
Like most herring species, American shad are very high in omega 3 fatty acids and, in particular, contain nearly twice as much per unit weight as wild salmon. They are also very low in toxins such as PCBs, dioxins, and mercury by EPA estimates. The American or Atlantic shad (&quot;A. sapidissima&quot;) is a valued food fish.

==Shad populations==

Declines in the Atlantic coast shad population were documented as early as the turn of the 20th century. Traditionally, shad were caught along with salmon in set nets, which were suspended from poles driven into the river bed reasonably close to shore in tidal water. Many of the rivers where shad were once common now suffer from pollution; however, the short time spent by shad in freshwater may minimize contamination. For example, fisheries scientists have found that shad in the Hudson River are not in the river long enough to be affected by PCBs and other contaminants (however, fishing for or possessing American shad [including catch and release] in the Hudson River or Marine District is now prohibited). Pollution, however, may impact shad reproduction and studies have been undertaken to determine whether fingerlings suffer DNA damage.

Most rivers across the historic shad range are now heavily dammed, eliminating many of the spawning grounds. For example, the number of shad harvested in the Merrimack River declined from almost 900,000 in 1789 to none in 1888, likely due to the inability to reach their spawning ground following a period of heavy dam construction. Fish passage efforts, including the Chesapeake Bay program, have begun to remedy this situation. While recreational angling has almost no measurable impact on shad populations, they are susceptible to commercial overfishing. Because of their highly migratory life history and their recreational and commercial importance, American shad are co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and state fisheries agencies. The Atlantic States Marine Fish Commission is a crucial forum for coordinating the collective effort to conserve American shad.

===Introduced in the North Pacific===
American shad were introduced into the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento River system in California in the 1800s, and they have spread throughout many river systems on the West Coast of North America. A large shad population occurs in the Columbia River. In recent years, shad counts at Bonneville and The Dalles Dams have ranged from over two million to over five million fish per year. Spawning shad returned to Columbia in May and June and migrated above Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River and above Priest Rapids Dam on the Upper Columbia. Unlike many introduced species, American shad have not been confirmed to have serious negative effects on the environment or other native fish species in the Columbia.

American shad are also occasionally found on the Northwest Pacific coast in Kamchatka, Russia.

==Shad fishing==
Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behaviors while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, turbidity and water temperature can trigger their feeding instinct. 

==Society and culture==
Shad serve notable symbolic roles in regional politics and culture. On the year of every gubernatorial election, would-be candidates, lobbyists, campaign workers, and reporters gather in the town of Wakefield, Virginia, for Shad Planking. Similarly, in Connecticut, the towns of Essex and Windsor hold annual shad festivals. Each spring, the town of Lambertville, New Jersey, on the Delaware River across from New Hope, Pennsylvania, also hosts an annual Shad Festival. The Salem County New Jersey Attorney Bar Association has held an annual Shad Dinner every spring since the 1940s. There is a shad museum on the Connecticut River in Haddam, Connecticut.

William Penn negotiated with the Lenape for the shad fishing ground Schuylkill in the 1680s. Shad, he said, were &quot;excellent Pickled or Smoked.&quot;

<doc id="1261378" wikidata="Q5151805" url="?curid=1261378" title="Comics' Greatest World">
<text>Comics&#x27; Greatest World was an imprint of Dark Horse Comics. It was created by Team CGW. Originally conceived in 1990, it took three years for the line to be released, which led to an industry-wide perception that it was created to capitalize on the speculator mania of the early 1990s. When the mania ended, most of the titles were canceled. &quot;Ghost&quot;, one of the imprint&#x27;s more unorthodox titles, managed to survive the longest. It was canceled twice, first in early 1998, before being revived later that year and canceled again after a run of just less than two years.

All Comics&#x27; Greatest World titles took place in a shared universe. Most of the action centered on four cities in a slightly skewed version of America: Arcadia, Golden City, Steel Harbor, and the Cinnibar Flats area of Nevada, home of an interdimensional rift called the &quot;Vortex&quot;.

The series started off with a story in &quot;Dark Horse Comics&quot; before kicking off in four weekly limited series, introducing the cities and characters. These were followed by several short-lived series, one-shots, and mini-series. Only a few titles lasted very long.

Around April 1995, the imprint was renamed &quot;Dark Horse Heroes&quot;. With the name change, the use of the city logos was also dropped.

<doc id="1261379" wikidata="Q7182220" url="?curid=1261379" title="Phil Nevin">
<text>Phillip Joseph Nevin (born January 19, 1971) is an American professional baseball infielder, coach, and manager. He was the manager for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for 12 seasons, appearing in 1,217 games played between 1995 and 2006 for the Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, Anaheim Angels, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins. He has previously served as a coach in MLB for the San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees.

Nevin attended California State University, Fullerton, where he played college baseball and college football, as a kicker, for the Cal State Fullerton Titans team. Nevin led the Titans to the championship game in the 1992 College World Series (CWS), after which he was named the CWS Most Outstanding Player and won the Golden Spikes Award. Chosen with the first-overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, Nevin went on to play in MLB for seven teams across 12 seasons. He was selected to appear in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

After retiring from baseball, Nevin went into broadcasting, and then managed the unaffiliated Orange County Flyers for a season. He managed the Class AA Erie SeaWolves and the Class AAA Toledo Mud Hens in the Tigers organization before joining the Arizona Diamondbacks organization in 2014, managing the Reno Aces. He then returned to MLB to coach the Giants in 2017 and for the Yankees from 2018 through 2021. He joined the Angels as a coach in 2022 and became interim manager after the firing of Joe Maddon. On October 5, 2022, the Angels signed him to a one-year contract as their permanent manager.

==Early life==
Nevin attended El Dorado High School in Placentia, California. After graduating, he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft with the 82nd overall selection. He decided to attend California State University, Fullerton after turning down an offer that included a signing bonus of $100,000.

==College career==
A two-sport star, Nevin played American football and baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, competing in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. He was a punter and placekicker on the Cal State Fullerton Titans football team. He was named an All-American placekicker his freshman year for the Titans as he connected successfully on his first nine field goal attempts and finished the year with a 15-for-21 field goal percentage. His longest field goal of the season was . In his junior year, he averaged per punt.

For the Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team, Nevin batted .358 with 56 runs batted in (RBIs) as a freshman. The Titans won the conference championship and reached the 1990 College World Series (CWS) that year. The Titans lost two games in the 1990 CWS, however, and were eliminated. Nevin batted .335 in his sophomore season. As a junior, he batted .391 with 20 home runs and 71 RBIs, winning the Big West Conference Triple Crown. &quot;Collegiate Baseball&quot; and &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Nevin the College Player of the Year. He credited his past CWS experience with allowing him to remain calm.

In three seasons at Cal State Fullerton, Nevin had a .364 average with 39 home runs and 184 RBIs. He led the Titans to the finals of the 1992 CWS, where the Titans lost to the Pepperdine Waves baseball team, which represented the West Coast Conference. Despite the loss, Nevin was voted the CWS Most Outstanding Player after he batted 10-for-19 with two home runs and 11 RBIs. He also won the Golden Spikes Award, given to the best amateur player in the nation.

===International career===
In 1990, Nevin tried out for the United States national baseball team to play in that year&#x27;s Goodwill Games and World University Baseball Championship (WUBC). To prepare for those tournaments, the team played a series against Japan and a game in Cuba. Nevin played second and third base for Team USA in 13 of its 22 games, batting .229. The team released him before the Goodwill Games and WUBC as it cut players to meet the roster maximum. Nevin was also considered for the 1991 Pan American Games.

Nevin tried out for the national team again before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The team embarked on a 30-game tour and 38-city exhibition-game schedule in the United States before leaving for Spain. He made the team and served as its starting third baseman throughout the tournament. Olympic coach Ron Fraser called Nevin an excellent player and student of the game. The United States finished fourth out of eight teams in the Olympics.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Houston Astros chose Nevin with the first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had evaluated Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros&#x27; decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a signing bonus of at least $1 million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to the best player in the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time as the best player of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft&#x27;s first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.

Bill Wood, the Astros&#x27; general manager, said the team believed Nevin was close to a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin&#x27;s training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball in an effort to prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.

Nevin traveled with the Astros at the end of their 1992 season but was not on the team&#x27;s roster. The Astros sent Nevin to the instructional Arizona Fall League during the off-season. Before the 1993 season, &quot;Baseball America&quot; ranked Nevin as the 30th-best prospect in baseball.

The Astros considered sending Nevin to the Jackson Generals of the Class AA Texas League to start his professional career. The team also considered promoting him directly to the major leagues, skipping the minor leagues entirely. At the Astros&#x27; spring training in 1993, Nevin batted .350 and showed good power hitting. The Astros weighed bringing Nevin to Houston for Opening Day as they sought to add a right-handed batter to complement the left-handed power of Luis Gonzalez, Steve Finley and Eric Anthony and make the team less vulnerable to left-handed pitching. But with Ken Caminiti in the first year of a three-year contract to play as the starting third baseman, Nevin had nowhere to play defensively. The Astros assigned him to the Class AAA Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League, one level below the major leagues, where he made his professional debut.

While Nevin was with the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager Rick Sweet to play Nevin as a left fielder, which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play different positions. Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin&#x27;s mentor, helping him keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform. Nevin started the 1993 season with a .247 batting average, but batted .309 with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBIs. By July, he had made ten starts in left field, without committing an error. The Astros, however, were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in &quot;clutch&quot; situations to cases where there were no baserunners and the score was not close.

Nevin&#x27;s intensity almost got the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson. He was taunted by a man seated in the front row, and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested.

Nevin played third base and left field in 1993. He batted .286 that season, with 10 home runs and 91 RBIs. He had a .359 on-base percentage (OBP) and .413 slugging percentage (SLG). &quot;Baseball America&quot; rated him the 24th best prospect before the 1994 season. He returned to Tucson that year, posting a .263 batting average with 12 home runs and 71 RBIs. He had a .343 OBP, and .393 SLG. Nevin also played first base. His major-league debut, however, was delayed both by his defense (61 errors in his first two seasons) and the MLB 1994–95 work stoppage.

The Astros traded Caminiti to the San Diego Padres before the 1995 season. With Caminiti no longer blocking his path to the major leagues, Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros&#x27; starting third baseman. But the Astros did not invite him to spring training. Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to work out with replacement players during the work stoppage. Not wanting to be seen as &quot;scabs&quot; by the Major League Baseball Players Association, minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players, while career minor-leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues. When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the replacement players, Astros&#x27; general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum, saying anyone who refused to play in the team&#x27;s first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract. The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season, while Dave Magadan started at third base on Opening Day. The Astros also planned to use Shipley and Chris Donnels at third base.

With the Toros in 1995, Nevin&#x27;s batting average improved to .291. He also posted a .367 OBP, and .463 SLG, while contributing seven home runs and 41 RBIs.

===Houston Astros (1995)===
The Astros promoted him on June 10, 1995, and he made his major-league debut a day later. Nevin played 18 games for the Astros during the 1995 season. He struggled with the Astros, however, batting .117 with no home run, one RBI, a .221 OBP, and .133 SLG in 60 at-bats. When he learned of his demotion to Tucson on July 5 in Colorado, Nevin cursed at Watson and Astros manager Terry Collins. After Watson called for an apology, Nevin said he would use the incident as a learning experience in controlling his temper.

===Detroit Tigers (1995–1997)===
The Astros acquired pitcher Mike Henneman from the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later on August 10; Nevin was identified as the player five days later. In 1996, Nevin played in Class AA for the Tigers with the Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League, where he was converted into a catcher by Jacksonville manager and former catcher Bill Plummer.

===Anaheim Angels (1998)===
After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, for minor league player Nick Skuse. After an injury to starting catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity to compete for the starting job with Walbeck. Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game.

===San Diego Padres (1999–2005)===
Before the 1999 season, the Angels traded Nevin and minor league player Keith Volkman to the San Diego Padres. Nevin made a late-career break with the Padres, appearing in 100 games for the first time during the 1999 season. He then had the best offensive years of his career: he hit 31 home runs with a .916 on-base plus slugging (OPS) during the 2000 season. He was named to the National League All-Star team in , when he hit 41 home runs with 126 RBIs and had a .976 OPS. He also led major-league third basemen in errors, however, with 27, and had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league third basemen (.930).

In 2002 Nevin played first base, which was considered his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed time with a strained left elbow. Three games after returning from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized.

Nevin suffered a dislocated shoulder in spring training in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder and returned to the Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin&#x27;s favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBIs for the third time in his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.

Nevin was often frustrated with the dimensions of Petco Park. He hit a double during a 2004 game that he believed would have been a home run in other stadiums; when he reached second base, he pointed toward Padres&#x27; general manager Kevin Towers&#x27; suite and threw down his helmet, resulting in a postgame argument. At the time, Petco Park had dimensions of 403 feet for left-center and 411 for right center (each would be shifted by at least ten feet eight years later). Towers said the two had a &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship.
Two nights after San Diego Padres management informed Nevin that Xavier Nady would replace him as the starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005. Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises, one of which was the Orioles.

===Texas Rangers (2005–2006)===
He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the non-waiver trade deadline, to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump. In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1–12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting average under .200, known as the &quot;Mendoza Line&quot;. The Rangers benched Nevin in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrián González after the team was eliminated from playoff contention. In his first game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to .182. He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.

Nevin had one year remaining on a contract worth $9 million. Manager Buck Showalter said that despite Nevin&#x27;s benching at the end of the 2005 season, he was his starting designated hitter for the 2006 season. Despite hopes that help from renowned hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo and the hitter-friendly Ameriquest Field would increase Nevin&#x27;s offensive production in 2006, he continued to struggle. He batted .216 with nine home runs and 31 RBIs in 46 games. The Rangers promoted rookie Jason Botts on May 23, and Botts began to receive Nevin&#x27;s playing time.

Nevin had only two hits in his last 32 at-bats with the Rangers, though both of them were home runs.

===Chicago Cubs (2006)===
The Chicago Cubs sought a slugging first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay the difference in the two players&#x27; salaries.

===Minnesota Twins (2006)===
On August 31, the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Minnesota Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins&#x27; outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.

With the Twins, Nevin stopped worrying about his statistics and enjoyed playing in a pennant race. Nevin appeared in the MLB postseason for the first time in his career with the Twins in 2006. The Twins were swept by the Oakland Athletics in three games; Nevin appeared in one of the three games, batting 0-for-3.

Unsigned at the beginning of the 2007 season, Nevin announced his retirement on May 12, 2007. During his twelve-season career, Nevin had a .270 batting average with 208 home runs and 743 RBIs in 1,217 games. After retiring, Nevin joined the Padres&#x27; pre-game radio show. He also joined ESPN as an analyst for the college baseball regionals during the College World Series.

==Coaching career==
Two seasons removed from his playing career, Nevin decided to return to baseball as a manager in 2008. That December, he was named the manager of the Orange County Flyers in the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL). The Flyers finished with a 37–39 record in 2009, fourth in the five-team GBL. Nevin planned to return to the Flyers in 2010, but a chance meeting at baseball&#x27;s winter meetings led to Nevin&#x27;s hiring as manager of the Erie SeaWolves, the Class-AA minor-league affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. He replaced the previous manager, Tom Brookens after Brookens was promoted to the Tigers&#x27; major-league first-base coach.
Nevin managed the SeaWolves for one season. On November 11, 2010, Nevin was named manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers&#x27; Class AAA minor league affiliate, and began to be considered as a potential future MLB manager. Catcher Omir Santos described his managing the Mud Hens as &quot;like having a big league manager in [Class AAA].&quot; Nevin had his first taste of coaching in the big leagues when he was added to Jim Leyland&#x27;s staff as an extra coach for the Tigers 2011 playoff run. On August 31, 2013, Nevin was fired after the team&#x27;s final home game of the season. Nevin&#x27;s record as manager was 192–238; the team never finished higher than third in the International League&#x27;s West division.

The Arizona Diamondbacks named Nevin as manager of the Reno Aces, their Class AAA affiliate, for the 2014 season. In his first season with Reno, he guided the Aces to a Pacific Coast League-best 81–63 record and an eventual Pacific Coast League Championship Series berth. After the season, the Astros interviewed Nevin for their open managerial position. However Nevin remained the manager of the Reno Aces for the 2015 and 2016 seasons.

On November 7, 2016, the San Francisco Giants named Nevin their third-base coach for the 2017 season, succeeding Roberto Kelly. After the 2017 season, the New York Yankees hired Nevin to be their third base coach. The Yankees did not renew his contract for the 2022 season.

===Los Angeles Angels===
On November 29, 2021, Nevin was hired by the Los Angeles Angels to serve as the team&#x27;s third base coach for the 2022 season. On June 7, 2022, following the firing of Joe Maddon, Nevin was named the Angels&#x27; interim manager. On the same day, Nevin managed his first game, but lost to the Boston Red Sox 6–5. On June 9, 2022, the Angels defeated the Red Sox 5–2, giving Nevin his first major league win as a manager as well as snapping the team&#x27;s 14-game losing streak. On June 27, 2022, Nevin was suspended 10 games for the intentional throwing at Seattle Mariners outfielder Jesse Winker by Angels pitcher Andrew Wantz while warnings were in place during a game against the Mariners the previous day.

On October 5, 2022, the Angels retained Nevin as the team&#x27;s manager for the 2023 season. In 2023, in a game between the Los Angeles Angels and the New York Yankees, Phil Nevin was ejected from the game twice during the ninth inning with the score locked at 2–2. The Yankees would go on to win the game 3–2 in the 10th innings. After finishing the 2023 season with a record, the Angels announced that Nevin would not return to the organization for the 2024 season.

==Managerial record==


==Personal life==
Nevin was diagnosed with asthma at two years old. Nevin was hospitalized and treated for asthma five times between 1987 and May 1990, each stay lasting about five days. Nevin is also allergic to grass. At 19 years old, he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that he had half the lung capacity of a typical 17-year-old.

Nevin&#x27;s first daughter, Koral, was born during his freshman year at Cal State Fullerton; he is no longer in a relationship with Koral&#x27;s mother. He met his wife, Kristin, at Cal State Fullerton. The couple have two children together; though they were separated during the late 1990s, the couple reconciled. His son, Tyler, made his MLB debut with the Baltimore Orioles in 2021. Another son, Kyle, played college baseball for Baylor University and was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2022 MLB Draft.

Nevin lives in the Heritage Estates neighborhood of Poway, California, along with San Diego sporting figures including Bruce Bochy and LaDainian Tomlinson. The neighborhood suffered significant damage in the October 2007 California wildfires. Nevin hosted a baseball camp for children aged six through 16 in 2010.

On May 11, 2021, the Yankees announced that Nevin had tested positive for COVID-19. He also developed a staph infection, and lost .

<text>The Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans) is a species of marine fish in the family Istiophoridae of the order Istiophoriformes. It is found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, except for large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic, from the surface to depths of . The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.

Tests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to ; however, more conservative estimates of are more widely accepted. More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of .

Atlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods.

==Description==
The Atlantic sailfish is a metallic blue fish with a large sail-like dorsal fin and a long and pointed bill-like snout. It is dark bluish-black on the upperparts and lighter on the sides (counter-shading), with about twenty bluish horizontal bars along the flanks; the underparts are silvery white. The tail fin is strongly forked. The fins are bluish-black and the front dorsal fin is speckled with small black spots. The bases of the anal fins are pale.

The length of this fish is up to and the maximum published weight is .

In previous studies, sailfish hunting schools of sardines rely heavily upon stealth and quick slashing or tapping with the rostrum in order to temporarily immobilize prey and facilitate capture in small prey. The adaptive advantage of the bill is highly debated and many different functions have been suggested. The bill has been hypothesized to increase the hydrodynamic qualities of the fish and even to ward off predators. However, it has been well documented that the sailfish utilizes the bill in hunting.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Atlantic sailfish is a pelagic fish of tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic Ocean. It ranges from approximately 40°N in the northwestern Atlantic to 40°S in the southwestern Atlantic, and 50°N in the northeastern Atlantic to 32°S in the southeastern Atlantic. It is a migratory species and moves about the open ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is from warm surface waters down to about .

==Taxonomy==
Some authorities only recognise a single species of sailfish, &quot;Istiophorus platypterus&quot;, with &quot;I. albicans&quot; being treated as a synonym for &quot;I. platyperus&quot;.

<text>WSAZ-TV (channel 3) is a television station licensed to Huntington, West Virginia, United States, affiliated with NBC. It serves the Charleston–Huntington market, the second-largest television market (in terms of geographical area) east of the Mississippi River; the station&#x27;s coverage area includes 31 counties in central West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio. WSAZ-TV is owned by Gray Media alongside Portsmouth, Ohio–licensed CW affiliate WQCW (channel 30). The two stations share studios on 5th Avenue in Huntington, with an additional studio and newsroom on Columbia Avenue in Charleston. WSAZ-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Barker Ridge near Milton, West Virginia.

==History==
===Early years===
The oldest television station in West Virginia, WSAZ-TV, began broadcasting November 15, 1949, on VHF channel 5. The station was originally owned by the Huntington Publishing Company along with the Huntington &quot;Herald-Dispatch&quot; and WSAZ radio (930 AM, now WRVC), and carried programming from all four networks at the time (NBC, CBS, ABC, and DuMont). However, it was a primary NBC affiliate due to WSAZ radio&#x27;s long affiliation with NBC Radio. When WCHS-TV (channel 8) signed on from Charleston in 1954, it took over the CBS affiliation and the two television stations shared ABC programming until WHTN-TV (channel 13, now WOWK-TV) signed on from Huntington a year later. In 1955, WSAZ-TV dropped DuMont after the network shut down. It is the only commercial station in the market that has never changed its primary affiliation.

One story of how the station&#x27;s call letters originated dates from WSAZ radio&#x27;s origins in 1923, when radio engineer Glenn Chase began airing semi-regular broadcasts from Pomeroy, Ohio. It moved across and down the Ohio River to Huntington in 1926, in part because Chase had his hands full keeping the station going. Chase later claimed that the station proved such a headache to him that he asked for the call letters WSAZ to signify that it was the &quot;Worst Station from A to Z.&quot; A more likely explanation is that the call letters were sequentially assigned by the United States Department of Commerce after WSAX in Chicago (now defunct) and WSAY in Port Chester, New York. However, the myth persists that the calls stand for &quot;Worst Station from A to Z&quot;, which WSAZ radio itself helped spread by using it as a slogan for many years.

In 1950, WSAZ-TV received Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permission to build a private microwave link to Cincinnati allowing viewers to get NBC programming live. As one of the nation&#x27;s first privately owned microwave systems, it was a remarkable feat for one of the smallest cities in the country to have a television station (at that time). The first live broadcast was scheduled for a Labor Day baseball game, but the system broke down for four hours and forced WSAZ to broadcast a fire at a nearby hotel. The Cincinnati link was replaced in favor of one from Columbus, Ohio, in 1952.

Also in 1952, the FCC released its &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot;, which ended the four-year-long freeze in awarding station licenses and included a realignment of VHF channel assignments. As a result, WSAZ-TV moved to channel 3 to alleviate interference with fellow NBC affiliate WLWT in Cincinnati. The channel move also created an opening for a new channel 5 station in Weston, which signed on as WJPB-TV (now sister station WDTV) in March 1954. As part of the frequency switch, the FCC granted WSAZ a boost in broadcast power, which at the time, was the highest ever authorized for a television station. This allowed the station to penetrate more of its huge viewing area, most of which is a very rugged dissected plateau. However, as the regulation of domestic television stations was normalized, WSAZ&#x27;s signal strength was reduced to the same levels as others in 1956. The station&#x27;s transmission tower was the tallest in North America until (now sister station) WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, activated a taller tower in 1959.

===Later years===
Huntington Publishing sold WSAZ-AM-TV to Goodwill Stations, owner of WJR radio in Detroit and WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan, in 1961 for $6 million– a handsome return on its purchase of a stake in WSAZ radio in 1927 (it bought full control in 1929).

Goodwill was merged into Capital Cities Communications in 1964. Capital Cities spun off the WSAZ stations in 1971 as a result of its purchase of several stations from Triangle Publications, with WSAZ radio going to Stoner Broadcasting, and channel 3 being acquired by Lee Enterprises. Emmis Communications bought the station in 2000 after Lee decided to bow out of broadcasting. Emmis then sold WSAZ to Gray Television in 2005. The Gray purchase made WSAZ-TV a sister station to fellow NBC affiliate WTAP-TV (channel 15) in Parkersburg.

Being based in Huntington, WSAZ-TV is located away from West Virginia&#x27;s state capital, Charleston. As such, the station opened a branch studio there in 1956. It also launched a low-powered repeater on UHF channel 23 to serve the Kanawha Valley in 1995. While Charleston and its close-in suburbs receive the main WSAZ signal very well, it was marginal at best in much of the Kanawha Valley due to the area&#x27;s rugged terrain. The translator was moved to channel 16 in 2003.

==News operation==
Largely because of its pioneering status in the state, WSAZ is one of the country&#x27;s most dominant television stations. It has been the far-and-away market leader for most of the time since records have been kept, usually boasting some of the highest-rated newscasts in the country. WCHS and WOWK have rarely come close. The station came in a close second to WCHS for a short period in late 2009–early 2010 due to lower lead-in numbers originated by &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. It is one of the few times in memory that WSAZ has lost &quot;any&quot; timeslot. WSAZ has since regained first place in all timeslots. In May 2012, WSAZ had the highest rated nightly news at 6 p.m. of any station in the top 100 television markets in the United States, with its 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. newscasts ranking number-two among the Top 100. The station has always devoted significant resources to its news department, resulting in a higher-quality product than conventional wisdom would suggest for what has always been a small-to-medium market.

Since 1956, WSAZ&#x27;s newscasts have featured two anchors, one based at the main studios in Huntington and the other in Charleston. NBC studied the format and used it as the basis for &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; anchored by Chet Huntley in New York City and David Brinkley in Washington, D.C. All of the big three networks have used this approach at one time or another since then.
From 1995 to 2017, WSAZ used W16CE to provide viewers with a &quot;split&quot; newscast. Weeknights at 5:30, 6 and 11, the two anchors appeared together on screen until a certain point (usually 10–15 minutes into the newscast) when the show &quot;split&quot;. For the remainder of the newscast, W16CE viewers and Suddenlink subscribers in the Kanawha Valley saw a newscast targeted specifically to them. The main station&#x27;s viewers, cable subscribers in the Huntington area, and satellite viewers across the market, saw a newscast featuring coverage from Kentucky and Ohio as well as West Virginia. WSAZ called this concept &quot;two-city news&quot;. This ended in 2017 when W16CE was shut down, but the newscasts still feature one anchor based in Huntington and one anchor based in Charleston. Outside of the aforementioned newscasts, all shows originate from the Huntington facilities. The weather and sports departments are also based there. In July 1993, WSAZ&#x27;s weeknight &quot;First at Five&quot; broadcast was launched.

Since the station has traditionally been one of NBC&#x27;s strongest affiliates, the network has been rumored on several occasions to buying WSAZ. However, NBCUniversal has recently sold off many of its stations outside the top 15 markets. Huntington–Charleston is currently the 70th market (the only market in the state in the top 100). Also, NBC has owned only one television station located outside the top 50 markets.

Rumors abounded soon after the Gray Television purchase of WSAZ that WTAP would scrap its news department and simulcast WSAZ&#x27;s newscasts instead. WSAZ has always covered Parkersburg events anyway and has long been available on cable on the West Virginia side of that market. However, WTAP&#x27;s broadcasts bring in as much revenue as WSAZ in part because WTAP is the only full-power station in Parkersburg.

WSAZ-DT2 formerly produced a prime time newscast every night for a half-hour, originally known as &quot;MyZTV Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;; however, when Gray Television bought full-power WQCW, it moved WSAZ&#x27;s 10 p.m. news to that station and expanded that newscast to a full hour. WSAZ-DT2 currently only repeats the second hour of &quot;WSAZ NewsChannel 3 Today&quot; weekdays at 7 a.m.

WSAZ remodeled the Huntington and Charleston newsrooms in late 2010 to prepare for high definition broadcasts. On June 26, 2011, at 6 p.m., WSAZ launched the first high-definition newscast in the Charleston–Huntington market. This was the second station in the state of West Virginia, following sister station WTAP in Parkersburg. Before the transition, the Charleston–Huntington market was the largest without a newscast in either high definition or 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Charleston–Huntington TV stations:
On September 5, 2006, WSAZ launched a new second digital subchannel to be the area&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate, under the branding &quot;MY Z&quot;. Although it is a digital subchannel, many local cable companies, as well as satellite provider DirecTV, air WSAZ-DT2 as a separate channel on their systems. At first, it carried infomercials other than during the prime time MNT programming, but on August 29, 2009, it began a secondary affiliation with This TV carrying programming from that network during the daytime, late nights, and on weekends. MY Z also aired second showings of some of WSAZ&#x27;s syndicated programs. MY Z also produced a 10 p.m. newscast, but this was moved to the full-power WQCW when WSAZ&#x27;s owners acquired that station. On August 26, 2015, WSAZ announced it was dropping This TV and affiliating with the MeTV network, carrying MeTV programming from 2:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., except for a one-hour repeat of the WSAZ morning news at 7 a.m.; syndicated programs from 6 to 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.; and MyNetworkTV programming from 8 to 10 p.m. with MeTV all day on weekends. As contracts for syndicated programming expired, MeTV programming was added to those slots. As of 2021, MyNetworkTV programming airs from 2 to 4 a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday mornings, an increasingly common fate for the service.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WSAZ-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 3.

<doc id="1261408" wikidata="Q156719" url="?curid=1261408" title="Kamianske">
<text>Kamianske (, ), previously known as Dniprodzerzhynsk from 1936 to 2016, is an industrial city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, and a port on the Dnieper River. It serves as the administrative center of Kamianske Raion and Kamianske urban hromada. Population: 

On 19 May 2016, it was renamed back to its historical name of Kamianske. Along with the city&#x27;s name change, the city&#x27;s hydroelectric station was renamed to Middle Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant.

Besides the hydroelectric station, the city houses a few other industrial enterprises: Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant (closed in 1991), Bahley Coke Factory and Dnieper Metallurgical Combine.

==History==
The first written evidence of settlement in the territory of Kamianske appeared in 1750. At that time the villages of Romankove and Kamianske, which make up the modern city, formed a part of the Nova (&quot;New&quot;) Sich of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. The city was known as &quot;Kamianske&quot; (; , ) until 1936, when it was renamed &quot;Dniprodzerzhynsk&quot; – the name honored the Dnieper River and the Bolshevik leader Felix Dzerzhynsky (1877–1926), the founder of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka.

On 11 August 1979, two Aeroflot passenger jets collided in mid-air near Dniprodzerzhynsk, killing all 178 people on both aircraft.

On 15 May 2015, the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, signed a bill into law that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with names related to communism. The following year, on 19 May 2016, the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada voted to rename Dniprodzerzhynsk, which reverted to using its historic name &quot;Kamianske&quot;.

Until 18 July 2020, Kamianske was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Kamianske Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven. The area of Kamianske Municipality was merged into newly established Kamianske Raion.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 8 April 2022, almost 12,000 people from the surrounding areas were temporarily evacuated to the city due to active hostilities. By 1 September, the number had increased to 35,000 people.

==Geography==
While mostly located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Kamianske stretches over the hydroelectric station onto the left bank where the portion of city is known as &quot;Livyi bereh&quot; neighborhood (literally &quot;Left bank&quot;). The neighborhood arches to the west of the Kamianske&#x27;s suburb of Kurylivka.

To the east Kamianske municipality borders Dnipro city creating an urban sprawl.

Kamianske is a city with a very difficult environmental conditions. The city is on the top 10 of the most air-polluted cities of Ukraine. There have been suggestions to assign the status of the ecological disaster city. Right-bank part of the city is mostly polluted, where the metallurgical, chemical industrial enterprises are located.

In 2008, an interdepartmental commission for solving environmental problems was created.

=== Climate ===
The climate is moderately continental, dry. The amount of precipitation per year is about 400 mm. The average daily temperature is -6°C in January, + 21°C in July.

== Administrative divisions ==
Kamianske is divided into three urban districts.
* Dniprovskyi District (western city district)
** neighborhoods: Romankove (former settlement), Livyi bereh
* Zavodskyi District (central city district)
** neighborhoods: City center, Dnieper Metallurgical Combine
* Pivdennyi District (south and eastern city parts)
** settlements: Karnaukhivka, Svitle
** neighborhoods: Sotsmisto, Pivdennyi, Bahliy Coke Factory, DniproAzot and Prydniprovskyi Chemical Factory

==Economy==
The economic base of Kamianske is almost exclusively centered on heavy industry, with ferrous metallurgy being the backbone of the local economy. Around 57% of the total industrial production is metallurgy and metal working. The chemical industry comes second with a 17% share of the total industrial output. While the exceedingly industrialized nature of the local economy ensures a rather high employment rate (as of 1 November 2007, official unemployment stood at 1.40%), it also contributes to excessive pollution and radiation levels in the city.

* Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant (closed down)
* Bahley Coke Factory
* Dnieper Metallurgical Combine
* DniproAzot
* Dniprodzerzhynsk Cement Factory

<doc id="1261419" wikidata="Q6222866" url="?curid=1261419" title="John Bradley (United States Navy)">
<text>John Henry &quot;Jack&quot; &quot;Doc&quot; Bradley (July 10, 1923 – January 11, 1994) was a United States Navy Hospital corpsman who was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism while serving with the Marines during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. During the battle, he was a member of the patrol that captured the top of Mount Suribachi and raised the first U.S. flag on Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945.

Bradley was generally known as being one of the men who raised the second U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as depicted in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; by photographer Joe Rosenthal. On June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced publicly (after an investigation) that Bradley was not in the photograph. The man long thought to have been Bradley was identified as Private First Class Franklin Sousley, who had previously been thought to be in another position in the photograph, and the man who had been originally identified as Sousley was identified as Private First Class Harold Schultz. Bradley is one of three men who were originally identified incorrectly as flag-raisers in the photograph (the others being Hank Hansen and Rene Gagnon).

The first flag raised over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was deemed too small. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi after it was raised that include Bradley holding the flagstaff, there is no photograph of the first flag-raising. The second flag-raising photograph became famous and was widely reproduced. Bradley also was photographed near the second flag. After the battle, Bradley and two Marines were identified as surviving second flag-raisers and were reassigned to help raise funds for the Seventh War Loan drive.

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, is modeled after Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of six Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima.

==Early years==
John Bradley was born in Antigo, Wisconsin, to Irish Catholics James (&quot;Cabbage&quot;) (1894–1953) and Kathryn Bradley (1895–1961). He was the second eldest of five children. He grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin, graduating from Appleton Senior High School in 1941. His younger sister Mary Ellen died of pneumonia at a young age. He had an interest in entering the funeral business from an early age, because he felt those were the men everyone looked up to, and later got a job at his local funeral home. He then completed an 18-month apprenticeship course with a local funeral director before he entered the U.S. Navy during World War II.

==U.S. Navy==
Bradley enlisted the U.S. Navy on January 13, 1943, when his father suggested it as a way to avoid ground combat. In March 1943, following his completion of Navy recruit training at the Farragut Naval Training Station at Bayview, Idaho, he was assigned to the Hospital Corps School at Farragut, Idaho. After completing the Hospital corpsman course, he was assigned to Naval Hospital Oakland in Oakland, California. In January 1944, he was assigned to the Fleet Marine Force and sent to one of the &quot;field medical service schools&quot; (FMSS) at a Marine Corps base for combat medical training in order to serve with a Marine Corps unit. After completing the course, he was assigned to the 5th Marine Division on April 15, a newly activated infantry division which was then being formed at Camp Pendleton, California. He was reassigned there to Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the division.

===Battle of Iwo Jima===

On February 19, 1945, the 5th Marine Division which included Bradley took part in the assault on Iwo Jima which was one of the most bitterly fought battles of the Pacific War&#x27;s island-hopping campaign.

Bradley was assigned to Third Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines before and when they landed on the beach with the ninth wave of assault Marines at the south end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. After Bradley and PhM3c. Clifford Langley, the other E Company corpsman assigned to Third Platoon, aided American casualties on the beach, they continued on with E Company as the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines advanced towards Mount Suribachi, which was their objective on the southwest end of the island. On February 21, Bradley risked his life under fire to save the life of a Marine at the base of the mountain who was caught in the open under heavy Japanese fire. While still under and exposed to enemy fire, and in order to save the lives of other Marines who were willing to expose themselves under fire to bring back the wounded Marine, Bradley brought the wounded Marine to safety himself. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions.

====First flag-raising====
On February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, the Second Battalion commander, ordered a combat patrol to climb, seize, and occupy the top of Mount Suribachi and raise the battalion&#x27;s flag if possible to signal it was secure. Captain Dave Severance, commander of E Company, organized a 40-man patrol taken from his Third Platoon and the battalion. First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, his executive officer and former Marine Raider, was chosen by Lt. Col. Johnson to be in command of the patrol to take the men up Mount Suribachi. At 8:30 a.m., the patrol started to climb the east slope of Suribachi. The patrol included Bradley from Third Platoon and Navy corpsman Gerald Ziehme (he replaced PhM2c. Clifford Langley, who was wounded on February 21). Less than an hour later, after receiving occasional Japanese sniper fire, the patrol reached the rim of the volcano. After a brief firefight there, Lieutenant Schrier and his men captured the summit. After finding a Japanese steel pipe and attaching the flag to it, the flagstaff was taken to the highest place on the crater. At about 10:30 a.m., Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg raised the flag. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheering from the marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships docked at the beach. A short time later, as the high winds on top caused the flagstaff to move sideways, Bradley helped make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at and around the flagstaff were photographed several times by Staff Sgt. Louis R. Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sergeant Thomas was killed on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

====Second flag-raising====

Since the first flag flown over Mount Suribachi was regarded as too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, it was decided that a larger flag should be flown on the mountain. Marine Sergeant Michael Strank a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered by Captain Severance to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the replacement flag. Sgt. Strank ordered Corporal Harlon Block, Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley to go with him up Suribachi. Private First Class Rene Gagnon, the company&#x27;s runner (messenger), was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return the first flag back down the mountain to the battalion adjutant.

Once all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Hayes and Sousley who carried the pipe to Strank and Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines from Lieutenant Schrier&#x27;s patrol to help them raise it. At approximately 1 p.m., Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the original flag. The second flag was raised by Strank, Block, Hayes, Sousley, Private First Class Harold Schultz, and Private First Class Harold Keller. Afterwards, rocks were added at the bottom of the flagstaff which was then stabilized by three guy-ropes. Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s (Associated Press) historical black and white photograph of the second flag-raising on February 23, 1945, appeared in Sunday newspapers on February 25. This flag raising was also filmed in color by Marine sergeant Bill Genaust (killed in action in March) and was used in newsreels. Other combat photographers besides Rosenthal ascended the mountain after the first flag was raised and the mountaintop secured. These photographers, including private first class George Burns, an army photographer who was assigned to cover Marine amphibious landings for Yank Magazine, took photos of Marines, corpsmen, and themselves, around both of the flags. 
====Subsequent events====
*March 1, Sergeant Strank and Corporal Block were killed.
*March 2, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was killed.
*March 4, Sergeant Genaust was killed.
*March 4, Bradley shot a Japanese soldier who was charging him with a bayonet as he was attending to a wounded Marine in a shell hole.
*March 12, Bradley and three Marines received shrapnel wounds from an enemy mortar round explosion. Bradley was wounded in the legs and feet and was evacuated from the combat zone to the battalion aid station. After being transferred to a field hospital, he was flown to Guam, Hawaii, and Oakland Naval Hospital.
*March 14, General Holland Smith ordered a U.S. flag officially raised with a ceremony at V Amphibious Corps headquarters located near Mount Suribachi, and the U.S. flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi be taken down. 
*March 21, Private First Class Sousley was killed.
*March 26, the battle of Iwo Jima was officially over.

===Bond-selling tour===

In March 1945, President Roosevelt ordered that the flag raisers in Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph be sent immediately after the battle to Washington, D.C., to appear as a public morale factor. Private first class Gagnon had returned with his unit to Camp Tarawa in Hawaii when he was ordered on April 3 to report to Marine Corps headquarters at Washington, D.C. He arrived on April 7, and was questioned by a lieutenant colonel at the Marine Corps public information office concerning the identities of those in the photo. On April 8, the Marine Corps gave a press release of the names of the six flag raisers in the Rosenthal photograph given by Gagnon: Marines Michael Strank (KIA), Henry Hansen (KIA), Franklin Sousley (KIA), Ira Hayes, Navy corpsman John Bradley, and himself. After Gagnon gave the names of the flag raisers, Bradley and Hayes were ordered to report to Marine Corps headquarters.

President Roosevelt died on April 12, and Vice President Harry S. Truman was sworn in as president the same day. Bradley was recovering from his wounds at Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California and was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he was shown Rosenthal&#x27;s flag-raising photograph and was told he was in it. He arrived in Washington, D.C., on crutches on or about April 19. Hayes also arrived from Hawaii and San Francisco on April 19. Both men were questioned separately by the same Marine officer that Gagnon met with concerning the identities of the six flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. Bradley agreed with all six names of the flag raisers in the photo given by Gagnon including his own. Hayes agreed with all the names too including his own except he said the man identified as Sergeant Hansen at the base of the flagstaff in the photo was really Corporal Harlon Block. The Marine interviewer then told Hayes that a list of the names of the six flag-raisers in the photo were already released publicly and besides Block and Hansen were both killed in action (during the Marine Corps investigation in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block&#x27;s name to him). 
After the interview, it was requested that Private First Class Gagnon, Private First Class Hayes, and Bradley participate in the Seventh War Loan drive. On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met President Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the flag-raising poster that was on display there for the coming bond tour that they would participate in. A press conference was also held that day and Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag-raising. 
On May 9, the bond tour started with a flag-raising ceremony at the nation&#x27;s capitol by Gagnon, Hayes, and PhM2c. Bradley, using the same flag that had been raised on Mount Suribachi. The tour began on May 11 in New York City and ended on July 4 with Gagnon and Bradley&#x27;s return to Washington, D.C. (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 after he was ordered back to E Company in Hawaii). The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war.

===Discharge===
Bradley was medically discharged from the Navy in November 1945.

==Marriage and family life==
Bradley married Betty Van Gorp (1924–2013), settled in Antigo, had eight children, and was active in numerous civic clubs, rarely taking part in ceremonies celebrating the flag-raising—and by the 1960s avoiding them altogether. He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor. Bradley&#x27;s wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep for the first four years of their marriage and kept a large knife in a dresser drawer for &quot;protection&quot;. He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, Ralph Ignatowski, who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend&#x27;s life.

==Marine Corps War Memorial==

The Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. The monument was sculptured by Felix de Weldon from the image of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi. Until June 23, 2016, John Bradley was incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze figure from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze figures of the other five flag-raisers depicted on the monument; Franklin Sousley is now depicted instead of Bradley as the third bronze figure from the base of the flagstaff, and Harold Schultz in place of Sousley is now depicted as the fifth figure.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront during the dedication ceremony with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers depicted on the monument, was also seated upfront with John Bradley, Rene Gagnon (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until October 16, 2019), Mrs Martha Strank, Mrs. Ada Belle Block, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day, Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation, General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people, Felix de Weldon, and Richard Nixon who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

==Death==
On January 11, 1994, Bradley died at the age of 70 at a hospital in Antigo, Wisconsin, having suffered a heart attack and subsequently a stroke. He is buried at Queen of Peace Catholic Cemetery in Antigo.

==Flag raising views==
Bradley wrote his parents a letter three days after the flag raising(s) that said he had a little to do with raising the American flag and it was the &quot;happiest moment of my life&quot;;. Sergeant Henry Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and he had worked on making the first flagstaff stay vertical in the ground.

On May 9, 1945, Bradley did an oral interview by a Navy captain about the famous second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, and said he was in the second flag-raising picture, and when questioned about the first flag-raising, he said Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas raised that flag.

Bradley was reluctant to talk to the media, family, and friends about the flag raising. He rarely did an interview about the flag raising for the newspapers, and he avoided reporters as much as possible. On February 23 each year, the press would contact his home to ask for interviews. He had his wife and children giving excuses such as he &quot;was on a fishing trip in Canada.&quot; In 1949, during the filming of the movie &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, Bradley told his wife to tell the townspeople that he was on a business trip in order to avoid attention that would be drawn to him.

In 1985, he did another interview about the flag raising at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley said that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become. He stated that he did not want to live with the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life. He also stated during the interview, that anyone on the island could have raised the flag and that he was just there at the right time.

Bradley saw the flag raising as an insignificant event in a devastating battle. He rarely talked to people about it and spent most of his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he &quot;just happened to be there&quot;. He spoke to his wife only once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said, that &quot;Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine ... it would have been something I had to hide.&quot; He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those who did not survive.

His son James Bradley speculated that his father&#x27;s determined silence and discomfort on the subject of his role in the Battle of Iwo Jima was largely due to his sad memories of his close friend on Iwo Jima who was killed by the Japanese, Marine Ralph &quot;Iggy&quot; Ignatowski. In his own words, and only once, he briefly told his son what happened with &quot;Iggy&quot;:

Official reports revealed Ignatowski was captured, dragged into a tunnel by Japanese soldiers during the battle, and later found with his eyes, ears, fingernails, and tongue removed, his teeth smashed, the back of his head caved in, multiple bayonet wounds to the abdomen, and his arms broken. Bradley&#x27;s recollections of discovering and taking care of Ignatowski&#x27;s remains haunted him until his death, and he suffered for many years from post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Second flag-raiser corrections==

Three Marine Corps investigations were held after World War II into the identities of the second flag-raisers who were made famous by the Joe Rosenthal photograph. None of the investigations were initiated by the Marine Corps.

A Marine Corps investigation of the identities of the six second flag-raisers began in December 1946 and concluded in January 1947 that it was corporal Harlon Block and not sergeant Henry Hansen at the base of the flagstaff in the Rosenthal photograph, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter. The identities of the other five second flag-raisers were confirmed. The investigation which centered basically on Block and Hansen was initiated by Ira Hayes in 1946.

The Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph, this time concluding in June 2016 that Harold Schultz was in the photograph and Navy corpsman John Bradley was not. Franklin Sousley, not Schultz, is now in the position initially ascribed to Bradley (fourth from left) in the photograph and Schultz is now in Sousley&#x27;s former position (second from left) in the photograph. The identities of the other five flag-raisers were confirmed. The changes were the result of focusing on Schultz, PhM2c. Bradley, the Sergeant Genaust film, and comparison of many photographs (Bradley carried two medical bags and Schultz had a noticeable broken helmet strap) taken on mount Suribachi. Schultz did not ever say publicly that he was a flag-raiser or in the photograph.

A third Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers concluded in October 2019, that Keller was in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph in place of Private First Class Rene Gagnon (fifth from left). Gagnon, who carried the larger second flag up Mount Suribachi, helped lower the first flagstaff and removed the first flag to take down to the Second Battalion command post. The identities of the other five flag-raisers were confirmed. The changes were mainly the result of focusing on Keller and Gagnon and comparison of even more photographs than the previous investigation. Like Schultz, Keller did not ever say publicly he was a flag-raiser or that he was in the photograph.

<text>USS &quot;Mercedita&quot; was a wooden steamer that served as a gunboat in the Union Navy during the American Civil War.

==Service history==
&quot;Mercedita&quot; was built at Brooklyn, New York in 1861. She was purchased by the Union Navy on 31 July 1861 from J. C. Jewett &amp; Co., and commissioned at New York on 8 December 1861, Commander Henry S. Stellwagen in command. &quot;Mercedita&quot; joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron on 3 January 1862, and the next day chased two vessels attempting to run the blockade; &quot;Julia&quot; and an unidentified ship ran aground trying to escape and were set afire by their crews. In March, &quot;Mercedita&quot; was ordered to Apalachicola, Florida to relieve in West Pass. There she destroyed the Confederate batteries at St. Vincent Island, Florida on 21 March. She and captured Apalachicola on 3 April. &quot;Mercedita&quot; pursued blockade runner &quot;Magnolia&quot; on 12 April, but during the chase Confederate ships &quot;Whitmore&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot; slipped through the blockade. &quot;Mercedita&quot; captured blockade runner &quot;Bermuda&quot; on 27 April and schooners &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Ida&quot; on 12 July.

In September, she transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 19 September. She served on the blockade of Charleston Harbor until the end of January 1863. On the night of 31 January, CSS &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and &quot;Chicora&quot;, both Confederate ironclad rams, slipped out of the main ship channel of the harbor. They hoped to recapture British iron propeller &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, taken by Union blockaders two days earlier with two powerful steam engines for new Confederate ironclads aboard. &quot;Mercedita&quot; was the first Union ship the southern raiders encountered, and &quot;Palmetto State&quot; succeeded in ramming her, ripping a hole in her keel, piercing her boiler, and leaving her in a sinking condition. Challenged &quot;Surrender or I&#x27;ll sink you,&quot; &quot;Mercedita&quot; – unable to move or bring her guns to bear – struck her colors. However, the Confederate rams – eager for further action – accepted paroles for &quot;Mercedita&quot;″s officers and crew and sped off to attack , and before retiring to Charleston.

&quot;A Lieutenant’s commission in the Confederate States Navy was conferred on me, with orders to report for duty on the ironclad Chicora at Charleston. My duties were those of a deck officer, and I had charge of the first division. On the occasion of the attack upon the blockading squadron ... It was my part, on the memorable morning, to aim and fire one effective shell into the Keystone State while running down to attack us, which (according to Captain LeRoy’s report), killing twenty-one men and severely wounding fifteen, caused him to haul down his flag in token of surrender. The enemy now kept at a respectful distance while preparing their ironclad vessels to sail up more closely. Our Navy Department continued slowly to construct more of these rams, all on the same general plan, fit for little else than harbor defense.&quot; -- William T. Glassell, Lt. CSN
Hardly captured before abandoned, &quot;Mercedita&quot; made temporary repairs before proceeding to Port Royal, South Carolina and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for complete repairs. In April, she was attached to the West Indies Squadron, to escort California steamers over part of their route, from New York to Aspinwall, Panama. Later that spring, she joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and operated from Beaufort, North Carolina for much of the remainder of the year. Joining the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in March 1865, she saw only brief action with it. In May, she searched for . When the conflict ended, the Union Navy resumed its peacetime activities, protecting American citizens and their property throughout the world. &quot;Mercedita&quot; went to Santo Domingo on 3 August to protect Americans there. Arriving at Ciudad de Santo Domingo on 11 August, the ship found the country in an unsettled political state, but there was no sign of the reported Spanish man-of-war on the southern coast. &quot;Mercedita&quot; departed Santo Domingo on 14 August, touching at Kingston, Jamaica on 17 August for coal &quot;en route&quot; home. Decommissioned on 14 October 1865, &quot;Mercedita&quot; was sold at public auction at New York on 25 October, and redocumented in merchant service on 9 November. She was converted to a brigantine on 16 June 1879.

<text>Nord-Aviation () was a state-owned French aircraft manufacturer. The bulk of its facilities were based on the site of Bourges airport, in the département of Cher, in central France.

On 1 October 1954, Nord Aviation was created as a result of the acquisition of SFECMAS (Société française d&#x27;étude et de construction de matériels aéronautiques spéciaux) by SNCAN (Société nationale de constructions aéronautiques du Nord). The company&#x27;s name, &quot;Nord&quot;, also became commonly used as a generic name referring to the Pingouin light aircraft. It manufactured numerous aircraft; perhaps Nord Aviation&#x27;s most successful aircraft was the Nord Noratlas, a utility transport used by both military and civilian customers. Other aircraft included general aviation, trainers and experimental aircraft, as well as other transports. Nord Aviation also developed and produced its own range of missiles; perhaps the most famous of these was the Exocet, a sea-skimming anti-ship missile.

On 1 March 1970, Nord Aviation merged with Sud Aviation and SEREB to form the &quot;&#x27;Société nationale d&#x27;industrie aérospatiale&quot; (SNIAS), which would soon after be renamed Aérospatiale.

Following the end of the Second World War, France&#x27;s aviation industries began to rebuild and reestablish themselves; many companies chose to consolidate and merge with one another during this period. On 1 October 1954, Nord Aviation was created as a result of the acquisition of SFECMAS (Société française d&#x27;étude et de construction de matériels aéronautiques spéciaux) by SNCAN (Société nationale de constructions aéronautiques du Nord).

A year prior to the company&#x27;s creation, the development of what can be regarded as perhaps Nord Aviation&#x27;s most successful aircraft, the Nord Noratlas, had been completed. Nord continued the programme to schedule, fulfilling its initial contract for 34 aircraft by 25 June 1953; the Armée de l&#x27;Air went on to order another 174 Noratlases. Eventually, a total of 228 aircraft would enter French service. In addition to this sizeable domestic appetite, the Noratlas was an export success as well; the newly formed nation of West Germany decided to address the German Air Force&#x27;s requirement for new transport aircraft by ordering a total of 187 Noratlases, the first of which were delivered during 1956. While the first 25 aircraft were manufactured in France, the remaining 161 Noratlases were locally manufactured by the West German-based Flugzeugbau Nord company; such aircraft were designated as &quot;N-2501D&quot;. Flugzeugbau Nord had been involved in the Noratlas programme from an early stage, it being the company&#x27;s first post-war aviation project, having been responsible for the design and manufacture of the majority of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage. In addition to these and other military customers, the Noratlas was also manufactured for the civil market, including a specialised de-militarised model designated &quot;N-2502A/B&quot;.

Several of Nord Aviation&#x27;s aircraft never progressed beyond the experimental stage of development. One of the more radical designs was the Nord 1500 Griffon, a ramjet-powered fighter aircraft developed during the mid-1950s to meet a French Air Force specification for a Mach 2 fighter. Two prototypes were ordered initially in a letter dated 24 August 1953, with the final contract, (No. 2003/55) in 1955; although intended to eventually fulfil a requirement for a light interceptor capable of operation from 1,000m grass runways, the two prototypes were ordered without military equipment for research purposes only. Production of the envisioned operational versions, often referred to as the &quot;Super Griffon&quot;, did not take place as it was found that the requirements could be met and exceeded with less complex and cheaper aircraft such as the more conventional Dassault Mirage III.

In addition to its range of aircraft, Nord Aviation also developed and manufactured a range of missiles; perhaps the most famous of these was the Exocet, a sea-skimming anti-ship missile. Development was started by Nord during 1967 under the designation of &quot;MM 38&quot;; its basic body design was based on the AS-30 air-to-ground tactical missile. The air-launched version of the Exocet was developed during the 1970s, it entered service with the French Navy in 1979. The missile gained a level of infamy for its use during the Falklands War of 1982, in which several British ships were damaged or sunk by Exocets launched by Argentinian forces. Both the Royal Navy destroyer and the 15,000-ton merchant ship were lost to use of the Exocet. Separately, an American frigate, the , was also damaged by two Exocet missiles launched by an Iraqi Air Force Dassault Mirage F1 while patrolling off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

On 1 March 1970, Nord Aviation merged with Sud Aviation to create Société nationale d&#x27;industrie aérospatiale (SNIAS), which was promptly renamed Aérospatiale. In turn, this company would ultimately merge into European aerospace corporation EADS in 2000, which was subsequently rebranded as the Airbus Group.

<text>Franklin Runyon Sousley (September 19, 1925 – March 21, 1945) was a United States Marine who was killed in action during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. He was one of the six marines who raised the second of two U.S. flags on top of Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;.

The first flag raised and flown over the mountain at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi after it was captured, there was no single photograph taken of Marines raising the flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, was modeled after the historic photograph of six Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.

==Early life==
Sousley was born in Hill Top, Kentucky, the second child born to Merle Duke Sousley (1899–1934) and Goldie Mitchell (November 9, 1904 – March 14, 1988). When he was two years old, his five-year-old brother, Malcolm Brooks Sousley (November 24, 1923 – May 30, 1928), died due to appendicitis. Franklin attended a two-room schoolhouse in nearby Elizaville, and attended Fleming County High School in nearby Flemingsburg from ninth to twelfth grade. His younger brother Julian was born in May 1933, and his father died due to diabetes complications a year later, at age 35. At only nine years old, Franklin was the sole male-figure in the family, and assisted his mother in raising Julian. Sousley graduated from Fleming High School in May 1943, and resided in Dayton, Ohio as a worker in a refrigerator factory.

==World War II==

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
Sousley received his draft notice, and chose to join the United States Marine Corps on January 5, 1944. He was sent to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California. On March 15, he joined E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, Fifth Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. In September, the 5th Division was sent to Hawaii for more training to prepare for the invasion of Iwo Jima. On November 22, he was promoted to private first class.

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====
Private First Class Sousley landed with his unit at the southeast end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi which was the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines objective on February 19, 1945, and fought in the battle for the capture of the island.

===== First flag-raising =====

On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company&#x27;s executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, to take a platoon-size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion&#x27;s flag to signal the summit was secure. E Company&#x27;s Commander Captain Dave Severance assembled the remainder of his Third Platoon and members from the battalion to form a 40-man patrol. At 8:30 a.m., the patrol started climbing the volcano. When the patrol reached the rim of the crater a brief firefight developed. Once they overcame the Japanese they secured the summit. A Japanese steel pipe was found for use as a flagpole and the flag was attached to it. The flag was then raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg at approximately 10:30 a.m. Seeing the national colors flying caused loud cheering with some gunfire from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near and docked at the beach. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Staff Sgt. Louis R. Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed on Iwo Jima on March 3, and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

==== Second flag-raising ====

Lt. Col. Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up and flown on Mount Suribachi after he determined that the battalion&#x27;s flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of the mountain. Around noon, Marine Sergeant Michael Strank, a squad leader of Second Platoon, Easy Company, was ordered by his Company Commander Captain Dave Severance, to take three Marines from his rifle squad and raise a larger flag on top of Mount Suribachi. Sgt. Strank chose Corporal Harlon Block, Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Sousley. On the way up the four Marines took telephone communication wire (or supplies). Private First Class Rene Gagnon, the Second Battalion&#x27;s runner (messenger) for Easy Company, was ordered by Lt. Col. Johnson to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag.

Once on top, Sgt. Strank ordered Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley to find a steel pipe to attach the replacement flag unto. A Japanese iron pipe was found and the flag attached to it. As Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise the heavy flagstaff. Under Lt. Schrier&#x27;s orders, Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block (incorrectly identified as Sgt. Hansen until January 1947), Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Private First Class Harold Schultz, and Private First Class Harold Keller raised the second flag at approximately 1 p.m. as the first flagstaff was lowered. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were both members of Lt. Schrier&#x27;s patrol. Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Navy Corpsman John Bradley helped some Marines make the flagstaff stay vertical. Afterwards, rocks were added to the bottom of the flagstaff which was then stabilized by three guy-ropes. The second raising was immortalized by the black-and-white photograph of the flag raising by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press; On June 23, 2016, Harold Keller was identified as Sousley in the photo and Sousley was identified as Navy Corpsman John Bradley in the photo (Bradley was no longer determined to be in the photo). Marine photographer Sergeant Bill Genaust also filmed the second flag raising in color.

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the 3rd Marine Division troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed on Iwo Jima on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.

==== Death ====
On March 20, 1945, the Marine Corps was ordered by President Franklin Roosevelt to send the flag raisers in Rosenthal&#x27;s photo after the battle to Washington D.C. as a public morale factor and to participate in a much needed war bond selling tour. Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1. Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21. The book &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2000) by James Bradley (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley who accompanied the 40-man patrol up the mountain), says Pfc. Sousley was shot in the back by a Japanese sniper as he was walking down an open road which was a known area of enemy sniper fire, and speculated that he lost his focus or thought the Japanese had stopped firing. According to the book, a fellow Marine saw Sousley lying on the ground and asked, &quot;How bad are you hit?&quot; Sousley&#x27;s last words were, &quot;Not bad, I can&#x27;t feel a thing.&quot; He then died of his injuries. However, Rene Gagnon, who knew Sousley personally for several months and saw Sousley the day he was killed, had signed an affidavit for the Marine Corps reporting that Sousley was killed instantly.

Pfc. Sousley&#x27;s body was buried at the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima, on March 25, 1945. A service was held there in the morning of March 26 by the division&#x27;s surviving Marines, which included Ira Hayes and other members of Sousley&#x27;s platoon and company before they departed Iwo Jima the next day. Sousley&#x27;s remains were reinterred on May 8, 1948, in Elizaville Cemetery in Fleming County, Kentucky.

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==

The Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. The monument was sculpted by Felix de Weldon from the image of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi. Due to some incorrect identifications of the second flag raisers, Sousley is depicted as the third instead of the fifth 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze statue from the bottom of the flagstaff since June 13, 2016 (Harold Schultz is depicted as the fifth bronze statue). The Memorial was turned over to the National Park Service in 1955.

During the dedication, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Orme Lewis, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Ira Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers depicted on the monument was also seated upfront with John Bradley (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until June 2016), Rene Gagnon (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until October 2019), Mrs. Goldie Price (Mother of Franklin Sousley), Mrs. Martha Strank, and Mrs. Ada Belle Block. Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day; Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation; General Shepherd, who presented the memorial to the American people; Felix de Weldon; and Richard Nixon, who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

==Portrayal in film==
In the 1961 film &quot;The Outsider&quot;, starring Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes, the fictional character James B. Sorenson (Hayes&#x27;s Marine buddy in the movie), portrayed by actor James Franciscus, was a composite based primarily on Franklin Sousley.

In the 2006 film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, about the six flag raisers on Iwo Jima, Franklin Sousley was portrayed by actor Joseph Michael Cross. The film is based on the 2000 book of the same title.

==Military awards==
Sousley&#x27;s military decorations and awards:
 
* Rifle Expert Badge (BAR)
* Rifle Marksman Badge (M1)

Note: The Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal required 4 years service during the World War II time period.

==Honors==
There is a small Franklin Sousley memorial in the Fleming County Public Library, in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. Additionally in Flemingsburg, there is the Franklin Sousley Museum located at Camp Sousley.

The VA medical center in Lexington, Kentucky was renamed for Franklin R. Sousley in 2018.

<text>The Anahuac disturbances were uprisings of settlers in and around Anahuac, Texas, in 1832 and 1835 which helped to precipitate the Texas Revolution. This eventually led to the territory&#x27;s secession from Mexico and the founding of the Republic of Texas. Anahuac was located on the east side of the Trinity River near the north shore of Galveston Bay, which placed it astride the trade route between Texas and Louisiana and from there to the rest of the United States. In new attempts to curtail smuggling and enforce customs tariffs from the coastal settlements, Mexico placed a garrison there after 1830. American settlers came into conflict with Mexican military officers, rose up against them, and increased political activity and residents of numerous communities declared support for the federalists, who were revolting against the Mexican Government.

==Background==

After Mexico gained independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Americans living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay. In October 1830, Bradburn established a post atop a bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac.

Bradburn was unpopular from the beginning of his tenure with those seeking to expand the Anglo-American presence in Texas. He opposed the efforts of the state land commissioner to grant titles to settlers who lived near Anahuac. The Mexican Constitution of 1824 prohibited immigrants from settling within of the coast, and most of these settlers lived too close to the coast. Although the commissioner was finally able to grant the titles, Anglo settlers were angry with Bradburn for enforcing Mexican law.

In January 1832, Bradburn received a letter listing 10 men in his jurisdiction who wanted to separate Texas from Mexico. From that point onward, Bradburn became increasingly obsessed about the Anglo-Americans and their intentions, believing that every event was part of a conspiracy to detach Texas.&#x27; In June 1832, two of Bradburn&#x27;s soldiers attacked an Anglo woman settler. Angry settlers tarred and feathered a neighbor who had failed to aid her. They demanded for Bradburn to turn over the soldiers for a similar punishment. After Bradburn refused, local men organized a Texian Militia company, supposedly to protect the settlement from the Indians. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias and so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, Patrick Jack. After Bradburn received death threats, he released Jack.

==1832 Disturbance==
===Prelude===
Tensions between Bradburn and the colonists escalated. Bradburn strongly supported the Mexican law forbidding slavery. In August 1831 he gave asylum to three men who had escaped slavery in Louisiana. The owner retained local lawyer William Barret Travis to represent him in trying to get the slaves returned. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter, ostensibly from a friend, warning that 100 armed men would come from Louisiana to reclaim the slaves. When Bradburn realized that the letter was a hoax, he arrested William B. Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection to separate the territory from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would lead to Travis&#x27;s execution. Unfamiliar with Mexican law, the settlers were outraged that Bradburn could arrest the man without a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most erroneously assumed they were still covered by the United States Bill of Rights.

Jack threatened Bradburn, who arrested him again. Travis and Jack then began plotting their escape. They attempted to smuggle letters to David G. Burnet, a fellow instigator; the letters called on Texians to aid them but stopped short of calling for armed rebellion. Bradburn intercepted the letters before delivery.

Although settlers at first did not get involved, they became alarmed at learning that Bradburn was taking statements from potential witnesses without allowing Travis, Jack, or their legal representation to speak with the witnesses. Jack&#x27;s brother organized a contingent of men to march from Brazoria to Anahuac. Anglos began arriving from other villages as well. One of the Brazoria councilmen, John Austin, stopped to consult Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the garrison on the Brazos. Ugartechea recommended that Austin request that the men be remanded into civilian custody.

Bradburn&#x27;s officers explained to Austin and company that the laws prohibited turning the accused men over to civilian authorities. The Brazoria men returned home. After they left, the Mexican officers discovered that their horses had been stolen. They arrested two local men on suspicion of the theft. On hearing of the new arrests, the Brazoria contingent returned to Anahuac. They camped with other angry civilians several miles from Anahuac and elected Frank W. Johnson as commander. The group soon captured Bradburn&#x27;s nineteen cavalry officers, who had been trying to reconnoiter the Texian position.

On June 10, the insurgents occupied buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn worried that the armed men wanted to do more than free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied to the ground and held at gunpoint. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Anglos to Turtle Bayou. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just to get them out of the buildings they had occupied. Unbeknownst to the Anglos at the time, the buildings contained extra ammunition and supplies.

===Battle of Anahuac===
After hearing Bradburn&#x27;s warning, the women and children of Anahuac fled the town. Mexican soldiers briefly engaged the men who remained; five Mexican soldiers and one Texian died in the conflict. After the skirmish, the remaining Texians gathered at Turtle Bayou to await the arrival of cannons coming from Brazoria.

On June 5, the Texians adopted the Turtle Bayou Resolutions. In this document, they announced they were federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. They decried &quot;the present dynasty&quot; that kept them under military rather than civil authority. While the Texians waited for their artillery, Bradburn appealed for reinforcements from Colonel Piedras, stationed at Nacogdoches north, and Colonel Elosúa at San Antonio, about to the west. On June 19, Piedras and about 100 of his men set out to support Bradburn.

John Austin and his men returned to Brazoria for the cannons. On June 20, he called the residents together, and they voted to oppose the centralist government. Austin invited Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who commanded the small Fort Velasco on the Brazos, to join their cause. After Ugartechea refused, on June 26 the Brazoria residents attacked the fort. The action became known as the Battle of Velasco. The next morning, Ugartechea surrendered under an agreement that he and his men would return to Matamoros but leave their artillery behind.

When Piedras was within of Anahuac, he sent a delegation to Johnson, who provided him with a list of grievances against Bradburn. Piedras negotiated a resolution of the conflict. Among the measures to which he agreed were:
*to reestablish the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; at Liberty;
*to release the civilian prisoners at Anahuac to civilian authorities
*to have Bradburn resign in favor of an officer of his choice.

With Texians&#x27; acceptance of the terms on June 28, Piedras marched to Anahuac on July 1.

===Aftermath===
Bradburn&#x27;s chosen successor, Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subarán, refused to take his place. Piedras took temporary command of the garrison. On July 2, he released the prisoners to the civilian authorities; within a week they were released with no charges filed. On July 8, Piedras left for Nacogdoches. He gave command of the Anahuac garrison to Lieutenant Cortina, previously the third-in-command.

Three days after Piedras left, the bulk of the Anahuac troops declared themselves federalists. The troops were drunk and Cortina, unable to maintain order, asked Bradburn to resume command. Bradburn refused, instead recommending that Subarán take responsibility.

After an attempt at his assassination was forestalled, Bradburn decided to leave Texas. None of the local ship captains would give him passage. On July 13, Subarán announced he would not guarantee the safety of any officers who supported the centralist government. That night, Bradburn left Anahuac; a hired guide took him on foot to Louisiana. Other officers sought sanctuary with sympathetic locals.

Historians have discussed Bradburn&#x27;s role. William C. Davis believes that he &quot;overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction&quot;. The resulting Turtle Bayou Resolutions, however, encouraged other Texians to follow similar courses. Many communities declared support for Santa Anna. When Piedras returned to Nacogdoches, he discovered citizens were forming Texian Militia companies. He asked the local &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; to order the militias to disband; they refused and instead formed their own militia. On August 1, the combined militias ordered Piedras to vow support for the federalist revolt. When he refused, the Texians attacked and the Battle of Nacogdoches commenced. Several days later, they took Piedras and his men prisoner and &quot;convinced&quot; them to become federalists. With the soldiers&#x27; surrender and retreat into the Mexican interior, no Mexican troops remained in eastern Texas. This encouraged the colonists to increase political activity. Soon after, they organized the Convention of 1832, marking the first attempt to gather Texians from each of the colonies to discuss common goals.

==1835 disturbance==
A second dispute arose in late June 27, 1835, again over the issue of customs. Leading up to this crisis, a large number of Anglo settlers had invaded the Anahuac area. The current commander was reported as being uneasy about the insubordinate attitudes of the locals, and he requested additional military assistance from his superiors. Tensions continued to escalate as some citizens demonstrated with anti-taxation protests and petitions. In addition, a group is known as the &quot;Citizens of Texas&quot; began to meet with the intention of realizing these demands. Andrew Briscoe, a local merchant and boat captain as well as a member of this group, complained that taxes were not being enforced equally at all ports. He intentionally tested the new commander, Capt. Antonio Tenorio, by loading his boat in a way to increase the curiosity of the officials. Briscoe simply loaded his boat with ballast. Tenorio was incensed and arrested Briscoe and his partner DeWitt Clinton Harris. The soldiers escorting Harris and Briscoe shot and wounded another Texian, young William Smith.

Travis played a major role afterward. When news of the arrests was heard in San Felipe de Austin, where radical sentiments were taking hold, the political chief Peter Miller authorized Travis to gather a Texian Militia company for a response. Travis commandeered a vessel at Harrisburg, and sailed for Anahuac with the company and a cannon. His 25-man force quickly gained surrender of the more than 40 Mexican troops. After disarming them, Travis and the company freed the Texians and expelled the troops.

Because Travis had acted without broad community support, he apologized to avoid endangering Stephen F. Austin, then in Mexico City. Austin was the most prominent empresario under contract by the Spanish, and later Mexican, governments to oversee the immigration of people to Mexico&#x27;s frontier. Later that summer, Mexican military authorities demanded the surrender of Travis for military trial. The colonists opposed this.

Travis and Austin continued active in Texas development. Travis died at the Battle of the Alamo. Austin served as secretary of state for the Republic of Texas for a short time before his own death.

<text>Faithful is a 2004 book co-written by Stephen King and Stewart O&#x27;Nan. It chronicles exchanges between King and O&#x27;Nan about the 2004 Boston Red Sox season, beginning with an e-mail in the summer of 2003, and throughout the 2004 season, from spring training to the World Series.

The book was dedicated to Victoria Snelgrove, an Emerson College student who was struck in the eye by the Boston Police Department with a projectile and killed during crowd-control actions near Fenway Park following Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.

On May 4, 2007, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that HBO would be adapting the book into a six-part miniseries for 2008. In September 2008, King wrote, &quot;The script is just goddamn hilarious.&quot; There is, however, no indication that such a miniseries was actually made.

<text>Fieldy (Reginald Quincy Arvizu, born November 2, 1969), , is an American musician, best known as the bassist for nu metal band Korn. He is also the guitarist/bassist for rock band StillWell.

==Career==
Prior to Arvizu&#x27;s time in Korn, he and Brian Welch, who would later become one of Korn&#x27;s two guitarists (alongside James Shaffer), had played together in a number of bands, having become friends while still at school. Upon their graduation from high school, Arvizu, Welch, Shaffer, and drummer David Silveria relocated from Bakersfield to Los Angeles and Arvizu, Shaffer, and Silveria formed L.A.P.D. (the name first stood for &quot;Love and Peace, Dude&quot;, but this abbreviation was later changed to &quot;Laughing As People Die&quot;). Although L.A.P.D. did succeed in signing a record deal, their success was limited until the band hired singer Jonathan Davis and changed their name to Korn.

The name &quot;Fieldy&quot; is said to have come about as an inside joke. Originally, his bandmates called him &quot;Gopher&quot;, due to his large cheeks. Gopher quickly became &quot;Gar&quot;, Gar became &quot;Garfield&quot; (based on the comic strip character of the same name), and eventually &quot;Gar&quot; was dropped and a &quot;y&quot; was added to &quot;Field&quot;, which became Fieldy.

Arvizu plays a five-string Ibanez model SDGR SR1305, named the K-5, which is his signature bass.

His playing style consists of bass-slapping, standard finger-style plucking, left-hand muting, and an ultra-scooped tone. His standard tuning is: A, D, G, C, F. He states Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as being one of the main influences towards his playing style. He has also stated to have been influenced by Billy Gould from Faith No More, Cliff Burton from Metallica and Les Claypool of Primus.

In August 2012, it was reported that Fieldy would be taking a brief break from Korn as his wife Dena was expecting a child. Korn began touring through Eastern Europe, Russia and India throughout August and September 2012 with fill-in bassist Ryan Martinie from Mudvayne. On June 21, 2021, Fieldy announced that he would not be accompanying Korn on their upcoming tour, later taking an indefinite leave of absence from the band. In a Facebook post to fans, he stated:

==Life outside Korn==
In addition to Korn, he has a rap side project called Fieldy&#x27;s Dreams. Fieldy&#x27;s Dreams has released one album titled &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Gangster&quot;. Like his Korn bandmate Head, Fieldy is a Christian.

Fieldy has been married three times. He married his current wife, Dena Beber, on May 13, 2006. Fieldy has five children: two daughters from his second marriage to Shela Colton, and three children from his current marriage to Dena: two sons and a daughter. Following the death of his father, Fieldy became a born again Christian.

Fieldy has stated that his second album, &quot;Bassically&quot;, was originally intended to be a hardcore rap album, but scrapped the original idea in favor of a jazz fusion style.

Fieldy worked with independent rap artist Q-Unique on a side project called StillWell. The song &quot;Killing Myself to Live&quot; can be heard on their MySpace page. Stillwell&#x27;s debut album, Dirtbag, released in 2011.

Fieldy was also working on his own clothing line &#x27;Immanuel one twenty three&#x27;; when asked about it while backstage at the West Palm Beach stop of the Mayhem Festival in 2010, he stated that it was &quot;much harder than he had previously expected&quot; to start a clothing line, and has moved on to the side project that he can &quot;be more proud of, opposed to his first solo CD under Fieldy&#x27;s Dreams titled &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Gangster&quot;&quot;. &quot;Got The Life: My Journey of Addiction, Faith, Recovery and Korn&quot; is a memoir Fieldy penned, which hit shelves March 10, 2009. His autobiography tells the story of how he found God, quit drugs, and found the better part of himself.

<doc id="1261459" wikidata="Q5669788" url="?curid=1261459" title="Harry Hood (song)">
<text>&quot;Harry Hood&quot; is a song that is commonly performed live by the American band Phish, first released on their 1995 live album &quot;A Live One&quot;. It is one of Phish&#x27;s most frequently performed songs, featured in 391 live performances since its debut on October 30, 1985.

== Background ==
&quot;Harry Hood&quot; refers to the Hood Dairy Co., a New England dairy company based in Boston. While the band was living with Brian Long in Burlington, Vermont next to a Hood milk plant, &quot;Harry Hood&quot; was the company mascot of the Hood Milk Co., and this character was featured in a 1970s television commercial in which people opened their refrigerator to find Harry Hood standing inside. The lyric, &quot;Where do you go when the lights go out?&quot; most likely refers to this advertisement, and to the automatic light in a refrigerator. A &quot;Mr. Miner&quot; is also mentioned in the song, a reference to a previous tenant of the house. While living in Mr. Minor&#x27;s former apartment, calls for Mr. Miner by debt collectors and such would frequently interrupt band rehearsals. For that, the band added the line &quot;Thank You, Mr. Miner.&quot;

The music for the song was written during Trey Anastasio and Jon Fishman&#x27;s 1985 travels in Europe. While on Pelekas Beach in Greece, they took LSD and decided to swim out to a raft just offshore. A violent storm came in and almost drowned Anastasio. After the near-death experience, Trey sat on the beach and wrote the music to &quot;Harry Hood&quot;.

== Structure ==
The song opens with a loose reggae section prominently featuring the bass, then moves through several contrasting themes before culminating in an improvised section that begins with a I-V-IV chord progression in D major.

== &quot;Glowstick wars&quot; ==
&quot;Harry Hood&quot; is famous among the band&#x27;s fans for its association with the spontaneous emergence of &quot;glowstick wars,&quot; a Phish-created audience and band interaction in which multicolored glowsticks were tossed from all points in the crowd, such as during the 1997 &quot;Great Went&quot; performance featured in the film &quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot;.

&quot;Harry Hood&quot; was performed at Phish&#x27;s supposed &quot;farewell&quot; Coventry two-day gig in 2004 on the rocks in the front of the stage. The rocks were placed in an effort to help control the massive flooding that turned the Coventry event into a muddy mess. Guitarist Trey Anastasio noted that the band was much further away, and so they performed closer to the fans in order to start a conversation among fans who would presumably return to their campsites and discuss whether or not the proximity of the band to the stage affected the &quot;flowage of the notes.&quot; At the end, the band stopped playing, allowing the audience to sing the “You can feel good, good, good about Hood” refrain.

==Album appearances==
Although the song has never appeared on a Phish studio album, concerts performances of the song appear on several of the band&#x27;s live albums. 
&quot;Harry Hood&quot; made its first album appearance on the 1995 release &quot;A Live One&quot;, which includes a performance from an October 1994 concert in Gainesville, Florida. The song subsequently appeared on &quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot; (1999; recorded 1998), &quot;Live Phish Volume 2&quot; (2001; recorded 1994), &quot;Live Phish Volume 9&quot; (2002; recorded 1989), &quot;Live Phish Volume 17&quot; (2003; recorded 1998), &quot;Live Phish 02.28.03&quot; (recorded and released 2003), &quot;Live Phish 04.04.98&quot; (2005; recorded 1998), &quot;Colorado &#x27;88&quot; (2006; recorded 1988), &quot;Vegas 96&quot; (2007; recorded 1996), &quot;At the Roxy&quot; (2008; recorded 1993), &quot;Hampton/Winston-Salem &#x27;97&quot; (2011; recorded 1997) and &quot;Ventura&quot; (2013; recorded 1998). The song has also appeared on concert recordings released by the band through their LivePhish website and on the DVDs &quot;&quot; (released 2008; recorded 1997) and &quot;The Clifford Ball&quot; (released 2009; recorded 1996).

<text>A truck stop (known as a service station in the United Kingdom, a travel center by major chains in the United States and a roadhouse in rural Australia) is a commercial facility which provides refueling, rest (parking), and often ready-made food and other services to motorists and truck drivers. Truck stops are usually located on or near a busy road.

==Truck stop services==

Smaller truck stops might consist of only a parking area, a fueling station, and perhaps a diner restaurant. Larger truck stops might have convenience stores of various sizes, showers, a small video arcade, and a TV/movie theater (usually just a projector with an attached DVD player). The largest truck stops, like Iowa 80 (the largest in the world), might have several independent businesses operating under one roof, catering to a wide range of travelers&#x27; needs, and might have several major and minor fast-food chains operating a small food court. Larger truck stops also tend to have full-service maintenance facilities for heavy trucks, as well as vehicle wash services that can handle anything from passenger vehicles to large trucks. Some truck stops operate motels or have them adjacent. Most truck stops now offer separate fueling areas, often with dedicated entrances, for standard-sized passenger vehicles. The truck refueling area almost always offers dual pumps, one on each side, so large trucks can fill both tanks at once. (The second pump is referred to as the &quot;slave pump&quot; or &quot;satellite pump.&quot;)

The fuel islands at many truck stops can get very crowded. Most trucking companies have accounts with one or two truck stop chains and, after negotiating a specific price for diesel, require their drivers to fuel exclusively at supported locations. Truck stops near a large city, or on the east or west coasts, suffer from the most congestion at their fuel islands.

The retail stores in large truck stops offer a large selection of 12-volt DC products, such as coffee makers, combo television units, toaster ovens, and frying pans primarily targeted towards truck drivers, who often spend extended periods of time on the road. Such shops generally offer a wide selection of maps, road atlases, truck stop and freeway exit guides, truck accessories (such as CB radio equipment and hazmat placards), plus entertainment media such as movies, video games, music, and audiobooks. Increasingly, as interstate truck drivers have become a large market for satellite radio, these retail stores also sell various satellite radio receivers for both XM and Sirius XM as well as subscriptions to those services. Kiosks run by cellular phone providers are also common.

Most long-haul tractors have sleeping berths, and many truck drivers keep their diesel engines running for heating or cooling for the sake of comfort. Because idling diesel engines make considerable noise (and are a source of pollution) they are often banned from such use near residential areas. Truck stops (along with public rest stops) are the main places where truck drivers may rest peacefully, as required by regulations. Modern innovations, such as truck heaters and auxiliary power units, are becoming more common, and some truck stops now provide power, air conditioning, and communications through systems such as IdleAir. Many truck stops used to have load board monitors for truck drivers to find real time information on loads, jobs, weather and news. However, DAT Solutions, the largest provider of load boards, removed its monitors from thousands of truck stops and moved all its services online and to its load board mobile apps. Most chain truck stops also have WLAN Internet access in their parking areas. Idle reduction—reducing the amount of fuel consumed by truck fleets during idling—is an ongoing economical and environmental effort.

==Australia==
In Australia a roadhouse is a filling station (service station) on a major intercity route. A roadhouse sells fuel and provides maintenance and repairs for cars, but it also has an attached restaurant (usually a café or diner) to sell and serve hot food to travelers. Roadhouses usually also serve as truck stops, providing space for parking of semi-trailer trucks and buses, as well as catering to travelers in private cars. In remote areas such as the Nullarbor Plain, a roadhouse also offers motel-style accommodation and camping facilities.

Approximately two thirds of truck stops are independently owned with the remainder being owned and run by &#x27;Big Oil&#x27; brands such as Caltex, BP and Shell.

==Germany and Austria==


In Germany and some parts of Austria there were newer official developments to the existing highway service station. The often state owned service stations at the highway were insufficient to deal with the growing number of lorries and the necessary stops for lorry drivers to rest. Since 2001, the traffic regulations of Germany &quot;Straßenverkehrsordnung&quot; include a road sign, &quot;Autohof&quot;, literally &quot;car yard&quot; or &quot;automobile court&quot;.

An Autohof is run by a private company, but the government provides the road signs at the highway, indicating an Autohof, if the facility:

* is no more remote from the highway than one kilometer
* can be approached by lorries
* provides at least 50 places for lorries, or at least 100 at higher frequented roads, those places must be apart from the places for other cars
* is open 24 hours a day, all the year through
* offers gasoline service 24 hours a day
* offers meals from 11.00 to 22.00; other food at the rest of the day
* includes sanitary facilities for handicapped people and for the proper needs of lorry drivers

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;truck stop&quot; is not in common use and the equivalent stops are motorway services. There are relatively few areas on motorways just for trucks to stop at. Most designated rest areas are used by every sort of motor vehicle.

On A roads (major routes which are made to a lower standard compared to motorways), a truck stop may have no refueling facilities but simply offer a place for tired drivers to rest and/or get food and drink in a transport cafe. They may not be signposted well, if at all.

Notable truck stop locations in the UK include:
* Ashford (M20, J10)
* Rothwell (A14, J3 )
* South Mimms (M25, J23/ A1(M), J1)
* Ellesmere Port (M56, J10)
* Chippenham (M4, J17)

==United States==
The truck stop originated in the United States in the 1940s as a reliable source of diesel fuel not commonly available at filling stations. This, coupled with the growth of the Interstate Highway System, led to the creation of the professional haulage and truck stop industries. They generally consist of, at the very least, a diesel grade fueling station with bays wide and tall enough for modern tractor/trailer rigs, plus a large enough parking area to accommodate from five to over a hundred trucks and other heavy vehicles. Truck stops should not be confused with rest areas or motorway service areas which cater mostly to cars and are often run by or leased from a government or tollway corporation.

In the United States in the late 1990s, Truckstops of America (T/A) changed its name to TravelCenters of America to reflect this marketing strategy. There is no exact distinction between &quot;truck stop&quot; and the newer term &quot;travel center&quot;, but some differences are size, proximity to interstate highways and major roads, the number of services, accessibility to automotive and RV travelers, and a certain extra emphasis on facility appearance. Many truck stops chains such as Love&#x27;s, Flying J and T/A also serve the recreational vehicle market. All the national chains have established customer loyalty programs to promote repeated patronage.

In Louisiana, truck stops that meet certain criteria are allowed to have on-site casinos that can operate up to 50 video poker gaming devices. These truck stops are regulated by the Louisiana Gaming Enforcement Division and must maintain certain amenities to be eligible to keep the lucrative gaming devices operating. Some of the amenities required are: having a certain number of acres of land, having a certain number of 18-wheeler parking spaces, having an on-site restaurant, and having trucker&#x27;s supplies, showers, telephones, television lounge, scales, laundry services, fuel.

Truck stops were often depicted in films and novels as being somewhat seedy places, frequented by aggressive bikers, petty criminals, and prostitutes (e.g. the &quot;&quot; in the JT LeRoy novel &quot;Sarah&quot;). This may be an outdated stereotype, as most modern truck stops are generally clean and safe, becoming a &quot;home away from home&quot; for many truck drivers. However, most truck stops reflect the social environment of their local area; consequently, one occasionally finds seedy truck stops in seedy areas. According to John McPhee&#x27;s book &quot;Uncommon Carriers&quot;, truck stops in rural areas are typically very safe and wholesome. However, as the distance to major cities decreases the incidence of prostitution, drug peddling etc. increases dramatically. The Vince Lombardi service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near New York City has the most rampant prostitution.

==Corporatization==
The economics of truck stops have driven most of the small, post-war operations out of business and they have been replaced with large corporate chains or franchises. Truck drivers are a captive market, because the trucks&#x27; size and local regulations place severe restrictions on where a truck driver can park. The initial investment in land, permits, equipment and maintenance requirements are large and growing: accordingly, some large truck stop chains have begun to cater to a wider range of the traveling public by combining trucks stops and traditional gas stations.

<doc id="1261465" wikidata="Q1810444" url="?curid=1261465" title="Rocker (subculture)">
<text>Rockers (also known as leather boys or ton-up boys) are members or followers of a biker subculture that originated in the United Kingdom during the late 1950s and was popular in the 1960s. It was mainly centred on motorcycles and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. By 1965, the term &quot;greaser&quot; had also been introduced to Great Britain and, since then, the terms &quot;greaser&quot; and &quot;rocker&quot; have become synonymous within the British Isles, although used differently in North America and elsewhere. Rockers were also derisively known as &quot;Coffee Bar Cowboys&quot;. Their Japanese counterpart was called the &quot;Kaminari-Zoku&quot; (&quot;Thunder Tribe/Clan/Group&quot;, or &quot;Thunderers&quot;).

== Origins ==
Until the post-war period, motorcycling held a prestigious position and enjoyed a positive image in British society, being associated with wealth and glamour. Starting in the 1950s, the working class were able to buy inexpensive motorcars so that motorcycles became transport for the poor.

The rocker subculture came about due to factors such as: the end of post-war rationing in the UK, a general rise in prosperity for working class youths, the recent availability of credit and financing for young people, the influence of American popular music and films, the construction of race track-like arterial roads around British cities, the development of transport cafes and a peak in British motorcycle engineering. The name &quot;rocker&quot; came not from music, but from the rockers found in 4-stroke engines, as opposed to the two stroke engines used by scooters and ridden by mods.

During the 1950s, they were known as &quot;ton-up boys&quot; because &quot;doing a ton&quot; is English slang for driving at a speed of or over. 
The rockers or ton-up boys took what was essentially a sport and turned it into a lifestyle, dropping out of mainstream society and &quot;rebelling at the points where their will crossed society&#x27;s&quot;. This damaged the public image of motorcycling in the UK.

The mass media started targeting these socially powerless youths and cast them as &quot;folk devils&quot;, creating a moral panic through highly exaggerated and ill-founded portrayals. From the 1960s on, due to the media fury surrounding the mods and rockers, motorcycling youths became more commonly known as &quot;rockers&quot;, a term previously little known outside small groups. The public came to consider rockers as hopelessly naive, loutish, scruffy, motorised cowboys, loners or outsiders.

The rocker subculture was associated with 1950s and early-1960s rock and roll music by artists such as Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and Chuck Berry, music that George Melly called &quot;screw and smash&quot; music.

== Café racers ==
The term &quot;café racer&quot; originated in the 1950s, when bikers often frequented transport cafés, using them as starting and finishing points for road races. A café racer is a motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than for comfort. Features include: a single racing seat, low handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided clip-ons mounted directly onto the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing petrol tanks (aluminium ones were often polished and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without half or full race fairings.

These motorcycles were lean, light and handled various road surfaces well. The most defining machine of the rocker heyday was the Triton, which was a custom motorcycle made of a Norton Featherbed frame and a Triumph Bonneville engine. It used the most common and fastest racing engine combined with the best handling frame of its day. Other popular motorcycle brands included BSA, Royal Enfield and Matchless.

The term &quot;café racers&quot; is now also used to describe motorcycle riders who prefer vintage British, Italian or Japanese motorbikes from the 1950s to late 1970s. These modern café racers do not resemble the rockers of earlier decades, and they dress in a more modern and comfortable style, with only a hint of likeness to the rocker style, nor do they share the passion for 50s rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. These modern café racers have taken elements of the American greaser, British rocker, and modern motorcycle rider styles to create a look of their own. Rockers in the 2000s tend still to ride classic British motorcycles, however, classically styled European café racers are now also seen, such as Moto Guzzi or Ducati, as well as classic Japanese bikes, some with British-made frames such as those made by Rickman.

== Characteristics ==

Rockers bought standard factory-made motorcycles and stripped them down, tuning them up and modifying them to appear like racing bikes. Their bikes were not merely transport, but were used as an object of intimidation and masculinity projecting them uneasily close to death, an element exaggerated by their use of skull and crossbone-type symbolism.

First seen in the United States and then England, the rocker fashion style was born out of necessity and practicality. Rockers wore heavily decorated leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with metal studs, patches, pin badges and sometimes an Esso &quot;gas man&quot; trinket. When they rode their motorcycles, they usually wore no helmet, or wore a classic open-face helmet, aviator goggles and a white silk scarf (to protect them from the elements). Other common items included: T-shirts, leather caps, Levi&#x27;s or Wrangler jeans, leather trousers, tall motorcycle boots (often made by Lewis Leathers and Goldtop) or brothel creepers/beetle crushers. Also popular was a patch declaring membership of the 59 Club of England, a church-based youth organisation that later formed into a motorcycle club with members all over the world. The rocker hairstyle, kept in place with Brylcreem, was usually a tame or exaggerated pompadour hairstyle, as was popular with some 1950s rock and roll musicians.
Largely due to their clothing styles and dirtiness, the rockers were not widely welcomed by venues such as pubs and dance halls. Rockers also transformed rock and roll dancing into a more violent, individualistic form beyond the control of dance hall management. They were generally reviled by the British motorcycle industry and general enthusiasts as being as an embarrassment and bad for the industry and the sport.

Originally, many rockers opposed recreational drug use. According to Johnny Stuart:

They had no knowledge of the different sorts of drugs. To them amphetamines, cannabis, heroin were all drugs - something to be hated. Their ritual hatred of Mods and other sub-cultures was based in part on the fact that these people were believed to take drugs and were therefore regarded as sissies. Their dislike of anyone connected with drugs was intense.

==Cultural legacy==

The rockers&#x27; look and attitude influenced pop groups in the 1960s, such as The Beatles, as well as hard rock and punk rock bands and fans in the late 1970s. The look of the ton-up boy and rocker was accurately portrayed in the 1964 film &quot;The Leather Boys&quot;. The rocker subculture has also influenced the rockabilly revival and the psychobilly subculture.

Many contemporary rockers still wear engineer boots or full-length motorcycle boots, but Winklepickers (sharp pointed shoes) are no longer common. Some wear brothel creepers (originally worn by Teddy Boys), or combat boots. Rockers have continued to wear leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with patches, studs, spikes and painted artwork; jeans or leather trousers; and white silk scarves. Leather caps adorned with metal studs and chains, common among rockers in the 1950s and 1960s, are rarely seen any more. Instead, some contemporary rockers wear a classic woollen flat cap.

==Rocker reunions==
In the early 1970s, the British rocker and hardcore motorcycle scene fractured and evolved under new influences coming from California: the hippies and the Hells Angels. The remaining rockers became known as greasers, and the scene had all but died out.

In the early 1980s, a rockers revival was started by Lenny Paterson and a handful of original rockers. Paterson organised rocker reunion dances called &quot;piss-ups&quot;, which attracted individuals from as far as Europe. The first rocker reunion motorcycle run of 30 classic British motorcycles rode to Battersea - home of the Chelsea Bridge Boys. Following runs went to other destinations with historic relevance to rockers such as Brighton.

In 1994, Mark Wilsmore and others organised the first Ace Cafe Reunion to mark the 25th anniversary of the closure of the famous transport cafe before going on to re-opening and establishing a series of events. These events now attract up to 40,000 motorcyclists.

<text>CKNR-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts an adult contemporary format at 94.1 MHz in Elliot Lake, Ontario. The station uses the on-air brand &quot;94.1 Moose FM&quot;.

==History==
The station first aired in 1967 at 1340 AM, and was owned by Algonquin Broadcasting. CKNR had two sister stations, CKNS in Espanola (established in 1976) and CJNR in Blind River (actually the oldest of the three, first established in 1958). Huron Broadcasting acquired the stations in 1976.

In 1986, CJNR and CKNS were given approval to amend their broadcasting licenses, by deleting the condition of license which required these stations to operate as affiliates of the CBC&#x27;s English-language AM radio network.

All three stations became part of Mid-Canada Radio in 1986, and were subsequently sold to the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990.

On November 15, 1990, CKNR was given permission to disaffiliate from the CBC as the Elliot Lake area was now served by the Corporation&#x27;s CBEC-FM.

On December 13, 1984, the CRTC approved a number of applications for a number of AM radio stations across Ontario including CKNR Elliot Lake to increase their nighttime power from 250 watts to 1,000 watts.

During the years on the AM band, both CKNR AM 1340 Elliot Lake (the originating station) and CJNR AM 730 Blind River operated at a power of 1,000 watts day and night, while CKNS AM 930 Espanola operated at 10,000 watts day and night making CKNS the strongest signal of the three.

In the 1980s and 1990s, CKNR and its stations CJNR and CKNS were branded as &quot;NR Radio&quot; and &quot;North Shore Radio&quot;.

North Channel Broadcasting acquired the stations from Pelmorex in 1996, and converted CKNR to 94.1 MHz on March 3, 1997 with a transmitter on Manitoulin Island. Due to the station&#x27;s signal strength (it can be heard as far as Sudbury and into Michigan&#x27;s eastern Upper Peninsula), the CJNR and CKNS signals were both discontinued. After the move to 94.1 FM, the station transmitted in mono and aired a mix of classic hits, oldies, and adult contemporary with some current music. Prior to and after CKNR&#x27;s move to FM, the station had aired the Toronto Blue Jays baseball games. The station identified itself as just simply &quot;CKNR FM 94.1&quot;.

North Channel subsequently sold CKNR to Haliburton Broadcasting Group in 2004, a sale which reunited CKNR with many of its former sister stations in the Pelmorex Radio Network.

After Haliburton purchased CKNR-FM, the station rebranded as &quot;94.1 Moose FM&quot; with adult contemporary, variety music and switched to FM stereo.

On April 23, 2012, Vista Broadcast Group, which owns a number of radio stations in western Canada, announced a deal to acquire Haliburton Broadcasting, in cooperation with Westerkirk Capital. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on October 19, 2012.

==Transmitters==
Although officially licensed to Elliot Lake, the primary transmitter is located closer to Little Current (approximately 80 km to the southeast of the city), and parts of the city of Elliot Lake itself consequently do not receive an adequate signal on the 94.1 frequency. On July 9, 2007, CKNR applied to re-broadcast their FM signal at 98.7 MHz to serve the population of Elliot Lake and received CRTC approval on August 24, 2007.
